The Rock," Welcome to the Rock
","I've heard one reviewer say about Michael Bay that he is aggressively untalented. This may be true, but as much as we all love to hate him, I cannot deny that he has made a couple of solidly entertaining movies. The Rock is one of them. I think this is his best movie and also one of the best action movies of its decade. With good performances from a sensational cast and rousing action, The Rock a worthy watch.We begin the story with general Frank Hummel, who is angry with his country. He feels that that families of his dead war comrades did not receive proper compensation. He steals sixteen warheads and holds a Eighty San Francisco civilians hostage in Alcatraz. He then gives the American constitution two days to pay (I forget how much money) or it's boom time. The FBI turns to one extraordinary individual for help. John Mason, is the only person ever to escape from Alcatraz. For reasons unknown to us, he has been locked away for thirty years, only released now to help. He is angry and unwilling, but eventually he cooperates. With the help of quirky FBI scientist Stanley Goodspeed, Mason takes a team to Alcatraz, to try and sabotage Hummel's plan from the inside. Is it gonna work?The story may not be super smart, but it holds together solidly, except for one silly plot twist which starts the climax. It has to do with the character of Frank Hummel, who is one of the more interesting bad guys in Hollywood blockbuster history. The script fleshes him out to a fairly large extent, and Ed Harris's performance brings a certain warmth to the character. It was not until A History of Violence came out when I realized that Ed Harris can play a really dirty villain. Compared to that movie, he seems about as menacing as a boyscout in the Rock. Sean Connery plays his role well, and unlike Harrison Ford, his age does not interfere with the character. Nicholas Cage is extremely funny as the typical nerd scientist, but at times he goes a little too far over the top. Regardless of where the characters have occasional flaws, you end up having too much fun with them to care.This applies to the Rock as a whole. It has its idiocies, but it does just about everything that a good action film should. It is almost the Die Hard of the decade.",8,2,2,25 July 2009
The Devil's Advocate," Interesting indeed, but somewhat overdone.
","the Devil's Advocate (based on the novel by Andrew Neiderman) provides rousing drama with satisfactory flair and presentation. At the same time however, the story is equally heavy and cumbersome. With each chapter passing, another plot component is added, which for a while makes everything all the more interesting, but at a certain point, you start to feel lost. The Devil's Advocate seems confused in direction. In an attempt to answer all the questions that are posed, the movie's ending is painfully overlong and ridiculous. Well if nothing else at least it gives the cinematographer and effects department something epic to work with. The Devil's Advocate is a lengthy movie. The finished project is not uninteresting, and in fact it is frequently involving, but you get the impression that it is trying too hard.As far as a Keanu Reeves film goes, this motion picture is a step in the right direction. Ironically though it doesn't qualify as a good performance. It only seems that way because he shares the screen frequently with Charlize Theron who upstages him with badness. Her delivery is so over wrought, that it denies common sense. Al Pachino is stable for a while, but during the course of the movie's last third, he goes into Scarface mode, and flies off the handle. I have yet to come across a movie in which the devil taking human form is justified in intelligence by an actor's performance. Outside of these people, (and Craig T. Nelson) nobody else in the cast serves a function other than killing screen time. So much goes on in the Devil's Advocate, but too little of it becomes important. As a thriller, The Devil's Advocate finds success. A good word to use would be 'startling'. I can recommend the film on the grounds that it feels original and viscerally entertaining, but it lacks a sense of fluidity or general intelligence. It could use a bit of a reworking.",6,1,2,26 September 2010
The Blair Witch Project," A project unlike any other
","Next to Spinal Tap, The Blair Witch Project is probably the century's most memorable mockumentary. Usually that term is associated with comedy, but this film although starting out kind of amusing turns into everything but. What we see is the footage captured on a handicam from three kids who went out into the woods in search of an urban legend, the Blair witch, but their incompetence got them lost, which led to frustration, which led to anger, which led to fear, and then to... well lets just say careful what you which for, you might find it.My first bit of advice for approaching The Blair Witch Project is this; take a gravol pill. The camera work which is intentionally shaky and awkward is nauseating, aside from that this is a wicked presentation (sometimes literally so) Cinema cannot get anymore subjective than this. On top of all that the film is actually pretty scary.If there is a flaw, it would be that the movie is a little too repetitious in its events, but thins is not a story that will leave you flat.",8,0,1,17 September 2009
The King's Speech," The King says a mouthful
","There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless. The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",8,279,330,10 December 2010
Insidious: Chapter 2," Insidious and aggravating
","I'll give James Wan and Leigh Whannell credit for one achievement in Insidious: Chapter 2; if nothing else, at least they didn't mail it in. When it comes to plotting, some follow ups are pure repeats of their predecessors, but for Insidious, Wan and Whannell have managed to build upon some of the makings of the first instalment. In doing so, they have shed a little bit of light into the darker and unexplained portions of the Lambert family's story, and elect to give it the conclusion that the characters deserve; a noble development in a genre where the audience is often un concerned about what becomes of protagonists. Here, unfortunately is where the success of Chapter 2 ends.The second Insidious is one of those films where you can't immediately decide whether it features too much story material, or too little. There is a lot going on in this film, but none of it ever seems to have a focal point. It is a dense film, chaotic and rushed, it features too many figures (both living and dead), flirts occasionally with the dangers of triple timelines and gives its characters almost no breathing room. The film is more concerned with their back stories than it is with their present ones, leading me to think that Insidious: Chapter 2 may have actually worked better as a two hour feature. The climax is especially hectic, and disorienting because of it's pacing and choppy editing. If this wasn't enough, Insidious: Chapter 2 is further crippled by its lack of genuine suspense. The movie is far less scary than it is borderline humorous. Even if Wan has once again respectably avoided copious bloodshed, There is no subtly in either the direction or the script, creating 'boo' moments that might cause laughter.Insidious: Chapter 2, is a sequel that appeals because it promises to build upon its set up, rather than repeat it. Only occasionally does it fulfil this promise. I won't say it was an unnecessary sequel, but there is simply no way it should have been this disappointing.",5,1,5,14 September 2013
The Avengers," Really liked it.
","The Avengers is almost the definition of good time at the movies. Not burdened with the need to spend great amounts of time on character origins, this superhero film takes a conveniently short amount of time to put the game in play, and once it does that, the game is played with flair and showmanship.Quite frankly, the plot itself is absurd, but I guess that was bound to happen when you combine the worlds of five different Marvel heroes. In less capable hands, the Avengers may well have ended up getting muddled from trying to do too much. With Joss Whedon in the director's chair, it's actually a very strait forward two hours with a good level of focus.While New York ends up getting the same treatment as much of Michael Bay's resume, the experience is far less superficial. the Avengers does not insult our intelligence. quite the opposite in fact, it embraces it. The Avengers' best quality is that it never ceases to wink at itself. This is a movie where even the villains the same quick fire one liners as the heroes. A good protagonist of course is also the difference between good action movie and good movie. Simply put, these people (or rather super people) are just good fun to be around. While none of them are ever quite fully rounded, when they come together as a team, they seem far less superficial than they did in their individual movies. with the exception of Iron Man, the films of Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk, were not all that memorable when it came to characters. The Avengers makes you realize how distinctive each character is.One thing I was a little disappointed in was Samuel L. Jackson. While he is very much at home in the role he plays, it seems pretty obvious that he's just playing himself. Perhaps, there is a hidden positive in this. As a supporting character, you don't wanna upstage the people who have top billings. Personally, I think he could've given The Avengers a little bit more love.Last summer was a somewhat underwhelming year for superheros. It's a pleasure then to see a film like The Avengers fly in to save the day. It's a film made with love, and the work has paid off.",8,4,10,16 June 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," How could this happen?
","Very disappointing, everything that worked in Vol 1, has backfired for Vol 2. I rather enjoyed the slow pacing of the first, here it is just frustrating, nothing happens. Though there is still plenty of black humour, I didn't care much for it. I was bored, there was hardly even any action. Several sections of the film seem unnecessary, and the finale is so anticlimactic, that I can't help but think Tarantino had bigger plans or that Something must've gone wrong during production. Maybe he had to rush to complete it, maybe he lost ten to fifteen minutes of exiting material. Whatever the case, vol 2. is a bore.That said, it would be wrong to say that the film offers nothing new. Uma Thurman gets upstaged by a killer performance from the late David Carrandine. He has a very commanding presence. Vol. 2 also gives us the answers to all the questions we had when vol 1 ended, but thats about the only thing useful in this screenplay. I felt cheated out of a good time with kill Bill vol 2. This leaves me with a tough decision. Considering the competence of vol.1 do I recommend it? only if you want to know what happens next. Otherwise, just get a friend to tell you, or have him/her screen you the mere two or three scenes which actually contribute to the story.then again, my opinion seems to be in the minority, so you I'd imagine you'd be liable to watch regardless of what I have to say",Null,4,7,14 April 2010
Black Swan," An epic and nightmarish delight
","Natalie Portman lives a dream and a nightmare when she gets a chance to dance Swan Lake in Darren Aronofsky's new filmBlack Swan is a very bi polarized film. Portman dances as the white swan flawlessly, but her 'brilliant' choreographer has doubts about her as the black swan. She needs to 'live a little' and be less mannered, but the closer she gets to that point, the more the walls start to close in all around her.Darren Aronofsky, though he comes close to being heavy handed, has delivered a project which is fiery, spectacular and clever. He sells us ballet as something dark and off putting, starting from his decision to reveal what dancing does to peoples bodies. One mistake and you can crack a toe nail under your body weight, but I don't wanna oversell it. To look at Black Swan in another way, it is an operatic horror film, It has incredible style, but uses it not so much to dazzle but to confuse and intimidate. The paradox of Black swan is that it creepiness is kind of seductive, because it draws you in (much like the way vampires are supposedly romantic)But style is only half the picture (not even). The rest is in the cast, and mostly in Natalie Portman. She is slow to get started, but she grows quickly and the result is arguably her best performance yet. I've never loved her that much. She's always struck me as more of a girl than a woman, but I guess all she needs is to get a little blood on her hands, and you have an award worthy performance. Vincent Cassel, though he gets some questionable lines, is also at his best. I would have almost liked to see more of him, because you get the sense that his role has a bit more room to grow.Black Swan does quite a bit, but it's not for everyone. Do not go into this expecting to be emotionally enriched. From the beginning, it is staged to be a mind-twirl, delighting in playing tricks on the audience. Some might call it cheating, but that would be the wrong way to look at Black Swan. It's quite epic, and with year coming to an end, I think it's fair to say that it is among the best of 2010.",8,182,302,3 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Cutthroat Island 2
","Thar be a treasure in store for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and it be the Golden Raspberry.After four entries, Sadly Pirates has lost its soul. This film may as well be marketed as Cutthroat Island 2. This is not THE Pirates of the Caribbean, it's just a pirate movie with no magic or charm. Convoluted as the second and third entries were, at least they had a sense of adventure, journey and spectacle. On Stranger Tides has none of the above. It is a scrappy walk in the park of a story, with bad plotting, poor cinematography, lazy acting, and it's over with so fast that it all feels pointless. In fact, I'd say it comes close to a rip-off. It is bad enough that there is no life to anyone in the supporting cast, but with Jack Sparrow, it is unacceptable. He's lost his persona and his zing completely, and his box of mannerisms alone does not make him a chartacter. I was also disappointed with Ian McShane. Having turned in what may be the best dramatic performance in television (Deadwood) It hurts a little to see how useless his portrayal of Blackbeard is. In fairness, he wasn't given a whole lot to work with. More than the actors, I blame the script. The once talented duo of screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio haven't even bothered to write anyone a part for this movie. Not only that but the dialogue is sloppy, full of needless exposition which doesn't end up explaining much.Even as a source of mindless thrills and chills, On Stranger Tides is weak. The only time when it comes close to matching the scale of its predecessors is in one scene, which sets pirates against killer mermaids. I remember thinking to myself during that sequence, how much Disney has changed in twenty years. It would have been nice to see the cast of the Little Mermaid show up to do a song number, and considering Rob Marshall's skill with music, it might have helped the movie.He is clearly in no position to direct this movie. He too is unable to bring much to the film, and I have a feeling he doesn't know what he's doing with 3-D photography either. Even in regular 2D, the film is quite dark, and grotesque. 3-D would be unwatchable I figure.The movie ends in the style of setting up for another entry, which I now have little faith in. Pirates of the Caribbean, has become little more than an amateurish cash-grab.",4,14,29,20 May 2011
Scarface," Most of it is good, but some of it is really bad
","At the beginning of Scarface, Cuban emigrant, Tony Montana is in US Custody, sitting is jail. By the end of the movie, he is sitting behind a desk, in a very expensive suit in a very expensive house. The product of his wealth: Drug money. In two and a half hours, Brian de Palma tells us how he gets from A to Z, but maybe not as well as the majority of viewers say.DePalma gets from A- to about M (for Montana) in competent fashion. Scarface ranges from very charming to very brutal and gives Al Pachino a chance to shine. So what goes wrong. The last third of Scarface feels like a different movie, an overwrought hack job. I'm not sure who is to blame, Pachino for his painfully overdone performance or DePalma for letting him get away with it. Or maybe it's Oliver Stone's fault for all the poorly scripted lines and developments which get worse and worse up until the end. At any rate, Scarface comes apart in spectacular fashion, leaving a movie that is medium good (at best) watch it and decide for yourself",6,0,2,19 November 2010
Love and Death," Almost priceless
","Some comedies take up to half an hour before any real laughter is provoked. Woody Allen's Love and Death, had me in stitches in the first three minutes, and it only gets better. There is a fine line between goofy and funny, and most films that try do not even come close to wedding them. Monty Python usually gets it right, but there are very few comedies which do it so brilliantly as this one.Love and Death is Allen's satirical portrayal of 19th century Russia, the age of Tolstoy and the war with Napoleon. Even when you hear Woody Allen's first lines, you may find yourself in titters already, simply by the fact that he retains his New York accent. If the youngest in your family is over twelve years of age, I would say Love and Death would make a great family feature, assuming you've worked your way through all the Mel Brooks films or all the Disney/Pixar films. The This one is mostly goofy comedy, but there is a fair amount of mature humour as well.One of the keys in making the transition from silly to funny is in both context and delivery. There is a moment in the film where Allen says to a girl 'you look more beautiful standing here than you do in person' Could there be a more stupid line in film? probably not. Coming from Woody Allen however, (delivering the line as if it is a completely mundane thing to say) it is a scream. I'd like to conclude with one last piece of advice. If you watch Love and Death, don't make it a dinner movie, because whatever you are eating you will choke on it from laughter.",Null,1,1,31 May 2010
Howl's Moving Castle," Artistic but too far in the shadows
","Visually strong and inventive, but with incompetent storytelling, Howl's Moving Castle is one of Hayao Miazaki's weaker entries in his otherwise impressive body of work. It is not nearly as heart warming as all his other films. This one is dark, moody, plodding, and contains too much badly scripted dialog. Therefore, I would have to say that Howl's Moving Castle is a disappointment. Sophie is a harmless young girl, who is cursed by the Witch of Waste with an old woman's body. One day while wandering on her own, she finds a strange mechanical mansion sitting on a hill and when she goes inside, she meets the young magician Howl, who she befriends and ends up traveling with. Along for the ride are Turnip head (a living, but mute scarecrow) and the power ridden Witch of Waste. Sophie slowly learns of Howl's darkest secrets, and finds herself with growing affections for him, despite him trying to keep his distance. she discovers that the boy's soul is ill because he is missing his heart, and she seeks to find it.Miazaki's creative genius is still strong, no argument there. The world he creates here feels like a combination of glamorous Victorian England and 'The Wizard of Oz', although the setting gets darker as the movie progresses. The story on the other hand is not well crafted. What is meant to be an elaborate story instead becomes complicated, dark and eventually dull. Howl's Moving Castle is neither adventurous nor romantic, and too far from the emotional grasp of the viewers. I don't recommend it.",5,2,4,27 June 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk smash through box office
","For me, The Indredible Hulk is the most special summer blockbuster movie of 2008, mainly because some of it was filmed in my neighbourhood, and I got to meet producer Gale Anne Hurd, and third time director Louis Leterrier. 2008 was a big Summer for superheroes, (Batman, Iron Man, Hell Boy and Hancock) but this one is my favourite. Although it was never intended to be a sequel to Ang Lee's film, this one does in a way pick up from Where 'Hulk' left off. Bruce Banner is an American fugitive hiding in Rio from the government trying to cure himself. Circumstances force him to return home to Washington where he reunites with Betty Ross, who helps him flee the military and her father, General Ross. Their quest to cure him takes them to New York where Banner meets his match in the Abomination. Hulk must become the good guy in order to stop it.Just as it was not intended to be a sequel, Letterier's approach was also not intended to be a brilliant movie, it was created simply to entertain, and it certainly does. Ignore the stupidity and you'll have a lot of fun.",7,0,0,9 June 2009
Captain Phillips," Honest, but dramatically underwhelming,
","A zodiac of Somali pirates charges after a cargo freighter, while the captain attempts to keep them at bay with his water cannons, but they manage to get close enough to jump on board. As the movie progresses it becomes increasingly obvious that the scrawny high jackers are in a pickle. Once the US forces engage them, their only bargaining chip is the captain's life. The pirates have their AK-47's but they never seem managing enough to even consider pulling the trigger. The fact that the pirates speak English is a problem for the movie. A hostage taker is far less intimidating when you can communicate with him. Captain Phillips manages to seem very casual as he gives his captors a tour, and even offers them food from his kitchen. You can't go wrong with Tom Hanks as the virtuous 'good soldier' who represents American model citizenship wherever he goes. Captain Phillips gets by on his performance, but it's not nearly as thrilling a story as most would have you believe.",6,0,0,22 July 2017
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Dawn is breaking, and the audience is going to sleep
","Taking a nose dive down from the certain enthusiasm that was visible in Eclipse, the Twilight saga just went from lean and mean, back to boring and broody.Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a film so confusing in its execution that if it were not for the overall lack of blood, I might assume it was a Roger Corman film. It is vile and unsympathetic, and the strangest part is that the way it ends, you might feel like there is no way that a part 2 is necessary. Part 1, might have even been that much more powerful without the knowledge that another film is on the way. This one concludes in the sort of manner that gives the audience an opportunity to use their imagination. Subsequently, the ending is the only good part of the movie; the rest is nonsense.In addition to having the worst acting of any of the films yet, the character interaction is once again beyond explanation. Most of the movie is spent in the Cullen household with the family and Jacob trying to keep Bella alive, while the baby inside her is draining her of life. A lot of useless dialogue gets exchanged in addition to a lot of grumbling (mostly from Jacob ... again). I also found it humorous how everybody waits for each other to finish a sentence in scenes that are suppose to be filled with panic. These are the kind of scenes where everyone should be scrambling and interrupting each other among other things. I felt like I was watching a play at times. Some credit should go towards the make up department for making Bella look scrawny and disgusting in the latter scenes. The quality of her face now matches the quality of her line delivery.Breaking Dawn, in trying to be a little bit more dark and sinister than the previous movies, instead has become more boring. There's no other simple way to put it ... it's just boring.",5,5,6,8 March 2012
The Equalizer," Passable action gimmick that could have been something more.
","The first few scenes of the Equalizer suggest that it is going to be an intelligent movie, and then it turns into a gimmick....Denzel Washington the untouchable action hero.There are individual scenes in the movie that are quite rousing and filmed with flair and panache. It's easy enough to argue that The Equalizer is a perfectly good action movie, but for the intelligent viewer, it is too hard to get completely emerged in because there are too many distractions.The script has a disjointed feel to it and it leaves its hero under underdeveloped. It's always nice to see Washington as a top tier bad ass, who is as untouchable as the younger Steven Seagal, but after fter one action scene you get the feeling that this movie is going to allow him to come away from every fight without even a scratch or a moment of hesitation. And then comes the ultimate action gimmick of all; a scene concludes with him walking away in slow motion from an explosion.The climax of the movie involves a one against ten face off in hardware megastore. Here we start to border on satire as Washington disposes of his enemies one at a time using the merchandise. these images will put a smile on your face, but they go on too long.The Equalizer, like Taken, is an action movie that doesn't rise above the sum of it's parts and leaves you a little dumbfounded about how seriously to take it.. There are dramatic undercurrents in they story that would have elevated the movie if director Antoine Fuqua has not chosen to abandon them.",6,6,9,29 May 2017
Ali," Not impressed
","I can't stand when movies take such iconic figures and make them into the kind of people that you don't want to see a movie about. Director Michael Mann takes this individual and strips his life of heart and soul, making him so lacking in character that he's impossible to care for.Muhammad Ali is defined by his ego in this movie, not by his personality or any of the people in his life. Mann's direction makes the film surprisingly distant, slow, poorly edited and devoid of glory. Will Smith has got the talent, it's all there, no question, but there is not much of a character for him to play. The same can be said about the rest of the cast; an ensemble of talented people filling the shoes of such boring underwritten characters. I don't feel like I learned a thing about Muhammed Ali from this motion picture. I'm not impressed.",5,6,12,31 March 2012
The Expendables 2," Still noisy, but much improved
","The Expendables are the dream team of action heroes, but what they amount to is a fighting machine that lacks character. Or at least that was the case with the first film.The Expendables 2 is no less noisy than its predecessor, but it shows improvement as a movie. What elevates this sequel its ability to wink at itself. It does this frequently enough to make the uncontrolled violence a bit more endurable. There is enough self-satire to the appearances of Schwarzenegger and Norris to make their presence quite worth while. The principle characters feel much less interchangeable in personality than they did in the last movie, partially because there are fewer of them. The working of a principle female character into the script is another nice touch, and I like that the movie doesn't make here a superficial bombshell in the way that other movies do. The intended audience is going to be well satisfied, but I'm not sure how Jean Claude Van Damme's fans will take it. The problem is not that he is a villain, but rather he is a lame villain. The few lines he has are poorly scripted, and his face is somehow always in shadow, leading me to the conclusion that he did NOT need to be in this movie. Anybody else would have been well at home in that role, provided that they could tackled Stallone.In a strange kind of way, Sylvester Stallone seems a bit more endurable in his old age. beneath his brawny facade, there is a small sense of melancholy to the guy. Maybe it's just because he is the star, but he always seems a tad bit more human than his colleagues.In the end though, it's just entertainment. A lot of bullets/knives go flying, a lot of vehicles get flipped, a lot of one liners get delivered. It's probably a bit overwhelming for most, but it's better than the first movie.",7,1,6,20 August 2012
Skyfall," The Sky falls on 007 in this one
","There are three items which make Skyfall worth some credit. First there is the title song. Regardless of whether the lyrics make sense (like all the other bond songs) 'Skyfall' is destined to be a soul classic someday. Second there is Javier Bardem's performance. His bond villain is as deliciously whimsical as he is sinister. Third there is Roger Deakin's cinematography, which compliments all the set pieces with extraordinary light and colour, and subsequent texture.Aside from this, Skyfall is dismissible. The biggest problem is Daniel Craig who plays James Bond with no love. He seems to interpret 007 as a creation of the cold and seclusive espionage world of John le Carré. That wouldn't explain however the way he just shoots back a shot of thousand dollar scotch as if it were a tequila and lime. What happened to your class Mr. Bond?Between the action set pieces, Skyfall is rather ponderous and void of wit or charm. The movie brings in a 'would be' bond girl (with the whole package; lips, legs) only to bump her off a couple scenes later in a way it feels like an attack on the bond girl tradition itself.Skyfall succeeds in dodging most of the gimmicks but fails to capture the highlights of the 007 legacy.",5,4,7,10 November 2017
The Ring," Prepare to be disappointed
","There is a lot going on in the Ring, but none of it actually amounts to the horror film that critics are calling it. This film is hardly anything more or less than a weird, and often ridiculous charade of a ghost story, which is occasionally evocative but less so than it is dreary. sometimes it is on the right track, but usually it is not.After the bizarre death of her niece, Rachel Keller, a young journalist is asked by the departed's mother to investigate. Her search leads her to a motel cabin where she finds an unlabeled video cassette. She players it once, it contains about twenty seconds of grainy miscellaneous shots including a dead horse, a girl coming out of a well, and bizarre ring of light. Moments later the phone rings and informs Racheal that she has a week to live. Can she uncover the truth before it kills her and subsequently puts her own son in danger.The story is kinda spooky, but it falls apart. In the end, the Ring is a failure simply because it makes no sense. True horror fans will watch the Ring and probably dedicate the rest of the day to figuring out what it all meant. As a horror fan myself, when I see a movie, I want to be scared and intrigued as I watch, not hours AFTER I've finished watching.As a protagonist, I kinda liked Naomi Watts. She doesn't have a lot to do but she does it well. A lot of her acting is done not with her words but with her eyes, in the same way Jeff Bridges acted with his body in Starman. I guess she is the only thing memorable about this otherwise mediocre motion picture. The Ring is dull, sloppy and doesn't do much for me.",5,1,2,19 September 2009
Deepwater Horizon," Shallowwater Horizon
","Director Peter Berg gives us the story of the greatest oil spill in American history. He succeeds in delivering all the damage, but fails to showcase the impact. On the grounds of drama, A movie like Deepwater Horizon will only strike oil if it is constructed as a drama about human beings, rather than a two hour treatment of a Wikipedia article. It's not a bad movie, but it has no soul. Something is missing. Deepwater horizon feels like a two act structure for a story that warrants three acts. There is a distinctive beginning, a middle and then it's just ... over.In the first part, we meet our main character (Wahlberg), his family and his co-workers. He hops a company chopper for a short flight to the Gulf of Mexico, and onto a doomed oil rig. It is there that we meet the unfavourable oil executive (Malcovich) who orders drilling to proceed after conducting a drilling pressure test that yields unsafe results. The teams starts drilling, and then mother nature fights back; flames go up. While the real person was in fact charged with criminal inelegance, Deepwater Horizon relies on our knowledge of the outcome to make Malkovich seem like the kind corporate 'bad guy'; that Hollywood loves to hate. To make matters worse, John Malkovich gives a lousy performance with an accent so phony and untraceable that you'd think he came from a planet in the Star Trek universe. As for Mark Wahlberg, for the most part he is playing himself, but in fairness the script doesn't give him much. Once the oil rig starts to go up, Deepwater Horizon succeeds in conjuring up some peril, but the camera work and lighting are highly disorienting, so after a while these scenes get tiresome. There is a brief moment near the end of the movie that is memorable because it gives a hint of what is missing. A bruised and battered Wahlberg gets out of a car, squeezes through the press and in to a building where he is met by a man who asks him what happened to his son. When he doesn't get the answer he wants, he attempts to man handle Wahlberg. What Deepwater Horizon needs is a sense of emotion impact from the turmoil, because you are left wondering how the survivors repaired their lives. another half hour of material would have helped with this. the fact that the movie denies us this renders all the family introduction scenes in act one a complete waste of time.There is more to this story than Peter Berg is able to deliver.",6,3,5,28 May 2017
Lone Survivor," Strong aspects make up for the weak ones in this action/war film
","A unit of four navy seals are staked out on a hill overlooking an Afgan village that they are supposed to lock down. They are spotted by a wandering sheep herder, and are forced to take him hostage. This leads to a well written and acted sequence wherein the four of them fight over whether of not to let him go for fear that he may turn pigeon. They make the best decision they can, but in the end they do get ambushed by the Taliban and have to fight for their lives while fleeing down the mountain until they can get their comms back upI liked Lone Survivor as action-driven (rather than an insight driven) war film. Like Randall Wallace's We Were Soldiers, war in this film is most a context for a bloody struggle for survival.Peter Berg does a good job of staging some intense firefights. Hiding behind the cover of trees, as the golden sun creeps through, Berg toys with our sense of distance as the enemy closes in.Once the bullets start flying, The film really showcases the characters' stamina as they take on more bruises and bullet wounds with each passing minute. And then there is an especially memorable moment where they take a long tumble down a rocky slope accompanied by a crunching sound mix that highlights the force of impact so well that you will probably flinch. As compelling as the fight scene are, they go on a bit too long.Mark Walberg commands the screen well, but I was more excited about seeing the usually wooden Taylor Kitch finally give a good film performance. The last act of the movie involves Walberg hiding in the home of an Afghan rebel and his son . These scenes are not as good as the rest because they bring some Afghan politics into the picture but fail to explain them well. Then there is a forced and silly moment where the son gives Walhberg a hug before he hops on a chopper to begin the long trip home.Peter Berg has a ways to go as a dramatic storyteller, but I think it's safe to say that this may be his best film yet",7,4,6,28 May 2017
Se7en," Se7en out of Ten
","Two cops are after a killer who is choosing his victims based on each of the seven deadly sins. This pretty much sums up the plot. I highly doubt that director David Fincher is an amoral misanthropic person, but he does want his audience to be disturbed. Se7en, is a good example of the right way to construct a thriller. It is potent and eerie, superbly crafted, nicely paced, even scary at times. The climax feels a little overly contrived as so many do, but I didn't feel cheated too badly. The movie ends on a bit of a funny note and when you stop to think about it, it leaves some things unexplained. As far a cop buddies go, I can't say that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freemon make a great pair. A film like Se7en requires two lead actors of equal talent, and Pitt is no match for Freemon, although that is just my opinion.Se7en is a movie that sinks its teeth in deep, and it provides enough fascination to keep a good viewer in his seat for the duration of two hours, but it is not a film for the religious, the squeamish or the weak of mind.",7,0,0,24 December 2009
Fury," A compelling achievement
","It is 1944. US forces are taking Germany back from the Nazis. FURY is the name of one of their tanks, and its crew are Brad Pitt, Shia LaBoeuf, Michael Pena, and Jon Bernthal.A screen commanding film, Fury is an achievement for Director David Ayer. He rises to the occasion summoning strong performances and crafting brutally vivid images and rousing fight scenes.The story is told largely from the point of view of a recent draftee, who wants nothing to do with war. He is assigned to Pitt's crew and there is a good scene where Pitt attempts to 'christen' him by handing him a pistol and bullying him into shooting captured Nazi, but the kid is too squeamish to do so. Despite being in some great movies, Brad Pitt hasn't done much for me in the last ten years. Since Inglorious Basterds, he has become a little monotonous. In fury he succeeds in channelling a convincing real beast which he hides behind his patriarchal composure.There is an intriguingly lengthy scene where he and his tank crew have breakfast in the home of two German women (complete strangers) , in a half abandoned town. It's not much of a breakfast but it becomes clear that the meal is less important than merely being in a home in the company of women (something that soldiers don't get the luxury of). Kicking off the last act there is a memorable one on one tank fight between our guys and a German Tiger tank. In the middle of an open field, they fight like man o' war ships in a bay, each relying on strategy more than fire power to bring the other one down. The climax is a suicidal stand off between our guys and a German platoon. Bullets and shells go flying amidst the surrealist lighting of explosions and flames. The ending we get is an inevitable one, but it is perfectly appropriate for the kind of war movie that Fury wants to be.",8,1,6,1 June 2017
Citizen Kane," Worthy of the praise, but best film ever? (hard to say)
","The thing about true brilliance is that it does not come instantly. In the same way that Van Gosh was not considered an artist till after he died, I would imagine it took a few years for the academy to even consider the possibility that giving the gold to How Green was My Valley (over Kane) was a mistake. Today there is no question. Some would argue that there is also no question that it is the best movie ever, I don't fully agree. I do like it a lot though.Citizen Kane is loosely based on the life of newspaper king William Hearst. And chronicles his life from boyhood to the grave. The film moves at a leisurely pace, never to slow or too quick and while it is not the most cathartic of movies Citizen Kane has much to say. To me, the film is driven primarily by Welles' performance. If you want something done well, you gotta do it yourself, and Welles knew that. The reason for the studio's dislike of Welles was because of his control freak attitude, but it results in some interesting decisions. One of which is the total absence of stars or names in the cast, definitely a positive. It keeps us focused on the story and not the stage or cinematic presence of popularity. What's more, Citizen Kane is the first feature for most of the cast. There are actually a number of moments which I can point to and say, 'this is not featured in any other movie of the time'. Citizen Kane has several tracking shots in which the camera literally goes through pieces of furniture and other solid matter. Now, I'm a smart guy, and I'm studying film production, but it wasn't until I heard Roger Ebert's commentary that I realized how these shots were achieved. I never would have guessed Even the title sequence is great, because it is subtle. When we see sixty or seventy year old movies, we are used to seeing title card credits, with loud blaring fanfare. That doesn't happen here. Citizen Kane absorbs us with its ambiance from moment #1, in addition to word #1, ROSEBUD.Throughout the movie, Kane ages pretty well, which shows skill on the part of the make-up job, the movie however has aged even better. Soem reasons are obvious, but others may not be. Perhaps this is what makes Citizen Kane so special from a 21st century perspective. This controversially is more epic than any other movie.Watch it and decide for yourselves,",8,0,1,1 May 2010
Inglourious Basterds," A very special war film
","Without doubt, Inglourious Basterds is the most inventive of WWII movies, taking many artistic liberties and subsequent risks. Most of it works quite nicely, but not all of it. Quentin Tarantino, is a director who always puts style over story. In this film there is a bit too much of the former and not enough of the latter. Several scenes are far too long and the ending is somewhat anticlimactic, so I wouldn't call Inglourious Basterds terrific, but it's reasonably close. It is definitely Oscar worthy material.In five chapters, Tarantino tells two stories about people out to kill Nazis. First, there is Brad Pitt and his goons going around France scalping Germans. Then there is a young girl who runs a theatre, and plans to kill the Nazi party on the night of some propaganda screening. Her family was killed by Colonel Hans Landa, played by Christoph Waltz whose performance just about makes the movie. Waltz in his first English role is so good that I would have liked to see more of him on screen. Inglorious Bastards may just be the most clever film of the year, even if it is not the best. It is occasionally flawed but overall interesting, thought provoking, creative and equally wacky.",7,1,5,23 December 2009
Underworld," Occasionally clumsy, but a good source of fun-disgusting fun
","Memorable make-up, Sensational Cinematography, Cool Costumes, and with both Werewolves and Vampires, you get two for the price of one. Now that is a pretty good deal. Underworld is not a bad directoral debut for make-up effects whiz Len Wiseman, yet the result is still missing something. The only factor that is not A+ material is the storytelling.The war between Vamps and Werewolves is one that has lasted a thousand years, Set in what looks like Central Eastern Europe, this Gothic story is about Celine, a young vampire and a skilled wolf killer. She is respected by her clan, until she breaks the laws when she partners up with Dr. Michael Corvin He has been bitten by a wolf and Celine has become aware that he might be at the centre of a conspiracy between the vamps and the wolves. The one flaw of Underworld is that it has a clumsy way of setting up conflict. Even the first scene which involves a long shoot out in the subway station is not terribly riveting because we have no idea of what is going on until long after it ends. It serves as merely eye candy, but action of epic scale should should never proceed exposition.Kate Beckinsale seems to be what the studio has used to sell the film, but in fact it is the art department, make-up effects crew, and the camera crew who make the picture come to life. Underworld is a slick flick. I guess that is all it intends to be, and if that is all you want, than you have come to the right place.",7,0,0,7 November 2009
Coraline," Animation sensation
","Without doubt the most inventive animated feature of the year. Cinematically Gothic, yet deliciously cute, designed with unparalleled creativity by Henry Selick who brought us The Nightmare before Chrismas and Monkeybone. Coraline is ten times better than either of these, and offers something for everyone.Based on Neil Gaiman's novel, this is the story of young Coraline Jones. She and her parents move into a new flat complex in rural Oregon (actually it is a very old flat complex). Coraline is unhappy and bored with the place until one night she finds a door to a parallel world and the adventure of a lifetime.Henry Selick's vision is unique and original, yet it shows hints of possible influence from some of the great artistic visions of the 20th century. The world comes to life in a very Dr. Seuss, or Wizard of Oz kind of way, and with caricatures similar to those of famed children's illustrator Tomi Ungerer (Moonman, The Three Robbers) Of course it also bear great resemblance to his Gothic classic, The Nightmare Before Christmas.Coraline is a little too dark perhaps to be a good family feature, I certainly don't recommend it for little kids, but it is perfect for everyone else.",8,0,2,21 July 2009
Passengers," A waste in space.
","Set aboard a massive ship on a interplanetary flight, Passengers may seem like a sci-fi movie but it's actually a chick flick; Guy gets girl, guy looses girl, guy gets girl back. Passengers crashes and burns on the contrived devices used to weave these familiar threads together. In terms of set design the movie is spectacular to behold, and but it's all a waste of space. We are looking at tens of millions of dollars of scenery in which to stage a ten cent romance. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do all the things that couples do, share breakfast, go dancing, jogging, and eventually enjoy a fancy dinner dressed to the nines. Aside from one sexy spacewalking sequence, The setting doesn't make these events feel any more remarkable than they would have been on Earth. As we near the final act, the ship starts to fall apart. Lawrence Fishbourne is shoehorned in as a mere plot device. Scruffy bearded and with a hungover stare, he looks as if he has just come off the street. Passengers raises some intelligent questions about the human experience, but rather than answer them it chooses to focus on the lobotomized charm of star talent. You can hear this familiar Hollywood tune in your head as the actors goes through the motions of Nicholas Sparks material.",4,0,1,22 July 2017
42," A noble, but safe biopic of a baseball legend
","42 has a handful of memorable scenes, a credible period feel, and moments of compelling acting; but somehow, the picture as a whole falls a little short of a home run.The word I would use to describe 42 is 'safe'. While I wasn't looking for an Oliver Stone, hit-me-over-the-head with brutal honesty kind of motion picture, I found the drama of 42 to be a little bit muted. This is a respectable and educational bio-pic for a mass audience; but strong film making, it is not. There is another problem I had. Harrison Ford gives a hammy and unconvincing performance that borders on caricature. Everyone else in the cast performs very naturally, while Ford relies more on overly theatrical mannerisms than emotion to give us a character.42 seems a little bit short in length for comfort. It is obvious that certain scenes were cut, scenes which I would have liked to see. For example the relationship between Robinson and his wife is virtually non existent. He proposes to her in the first act, and their chemistry pretty much ends there. The film chose a good place to end its story arc, (when taking real history into account) but the ending itself feels a little rushed. 42 is a noble film, and a mostly accurate one. It is a film that many people aught to see, but not all of them will like. I believe that the story of Jackie Robinson deserved a bit more dramatic momentum and a bit less sentimentality than Brian Helgelands bio pic provides. This is a medium good film, that should have been a great one.",6,5,7,17 August 2013
The Other Boleyn Girl," Glamorous film with the ups and downs of melodrama.
","Well what do you know, Anne Boleyn has a sister. Even more interesting, she gives King Henry the son he wants, that should make everything okay right? Well not exactly. If the movie ended there The Other Boleyn Girl would be a mere forty minutes in running length. The remaining fifty-sixty minutes, are a bloated mess, quite uninteresting and not very sympathetic. Even so, The Other Boleyn Girl doesn't end up being a bad movie. It's a gorgeous looking production, and it has a few exceptionally dramatic scenes, but the whole thing just doesn't amount to very much.Personally I've never been fond of Natalie Portman. She strikes me as more of a 'girl' than a 'woman' in all her roles, and not simply because she is small. She plays more of a woman here, though I think she is more interested in looking pretty rather than powerful. Eric Bana is much better as King Henry. He is not just a pretty face.The Other Bolelyn Girl, is pure melodrama, which is all it intends to be I guess. The whole thing just feels too loose, and unorganized, sometimes that can happen when adapting a book. It is best looked at as a smart chick flick.",6,1,1,25 April 2010
The Girl Next Door," Overly contrived, unfocused teen comedy which has its moments, but doesn't work
","What sounded like a fun, sexy inventive comedy just stands to prove, that like people or anything else in the world, looks can be deceiving. The Girl Next Door is not entirely dead in the water, but it's disappointing. Comedies can get away with being impossible for sure, but this film starts out rather strait forward, and then progressively defies common sense without adding any real humour or wit to justify it. Everynow and then, I did find myself laughing, (out loud even) but these moments are too few and far between in a rather lame screenplay, which doesn't amount to much.Another problem is the lack of character. I wanted to care for the two love birds that the movie is supposed to be about, but their romance is highly unbelievable and turns out to be the last of the film's interests. We spend more time with characters that really don't have any major importance, and the film's attempts to make them important don't work. So much happens in the film, that about one hour in, you'd think it's about to collapse. Actually The climax is the best part. It is here where the humour is at its best (although that still doesn't say enough) and then in the last five minutes, things get sour again, in the form of a piece of s**t ending which is arguably the most idiotic part, and is totally unsatisfactory. Director Luke Greenfield is so desperate to shock and surprise his audience over the course of ninety plus minutes, that he seems to have forgotten the most important ingredients of the film. The Girl Next Door is bone dry of charm and intelligence, and it's sense of humour is inconsistent and also insufficent. I'll have to say skip this film.",5,0,4,3 July 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Hot, sandy fun
","It would be easy for a cynical person to ask why if Hollywood is supposedly not racist and politically correct do they make films like Prince of Persia. The casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as a Persian is definitely not politically correct. It is funny how everyone has brought that up, yet nobody has ever bothered to mention that the image of Jesus (which has been worshipped for 2000 years) is ten fold more racist. Jesus of Nazareth would have been tanned skinned and Dark haired like all Isrealites, not the Caucasian, brown haired fella we know so well. It is a crazy world, and Prince of Persia is a crazy movie, but the summer of 2010 has just begun and as far as blockbusters are concerned, this may be the first good one, (if you don't go for Iron Man 2)Even though it takes itself seriously, there are times when Prince of Persia can be looked at as partial satire. Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton, make a fun screen couple, and they get to exchange one liners frequently. We also have Alfred Molina, in a scene stealing performance as a kind of 20th century figure in Persian robes. He reminds me of the surf in Monty Python's Holy Grail who tells the king that he did'nt 'vote' for him.Prince of Persia also reminds me a bit of last month's Clash of the Titans, only less rushed, much looser and more enjoyable. The fight scenes (while they don't offer anything new) are well done, maintaining enough visual coherency and good choreography to deserve some credit. These scenes take up about 70% of screen time. The plot beneath it, is gimmicky but actually a bit more convoluted than I am used to seeing. There are a lot of names and faces to remember for anyone with a short attention span. It turns out not to be such a big deal. The story does, go somewhere, and we the viewers go with it for a fairly engaging two hours. Prince of Persia, though far from being great like the empire was, proves to be good weekend time investment.",7,1,3,28 May 2010
Black Book," Solid and gripping, Paul Verhoeven has grown his brains back
","Paul Verhoeven struck gold with Robocop, which I found clever, but other wise I think he is pretty much a one track mind (well maybe two track). His motion pictures are either driven by sex or gratuitous violence.It would be a stretch to call this a miracle, but Verhoeven's latest film Black Book has brought out the absolute best in him. Though it could use a bit of trimming, this motion picture is a constantly gripping and thrilling story, morally ironic, and though occasionally contrived, it is definitely not the product of the hack behind Showgirls and Basic InstinctBlack Book is based on a true story of a Jewish girl in Holland, in 1944. After her family was gunned down by Nazis, she joined the resistance and infiltrated the gestapo as a singer, and she quickly became mistress to the head Commander, who himself was actually had secret arrangements with the resistance (which of course it treason) Ergo, they both had something to hide which could get them killed.The pace is stable and progressive up till the last half hour, where it drags on a bit long in an attempt to tie up some loose ends. It is here where Black Book is at its most controversial and ironic, yet also at its most intense. Verhoeven is takes this project very seriously, probably more so than anything he has ever done. In fact, there is nothing really to suggest that this is a Verhoeven picture. When it wants to, the film can get fairly nasty but never too hammy and the sexual content and violence are not actually that excessive or as overdone as I was expecting. I'll raise my glass to Paul Verhoeven for this one. It's a pretty solid WWII film, and certainly his finest work yet.",8,0,2,12 June 2010
127 Hours," A potentially profound adventure handled like it wasn't. (Just not bad)
","Aron Ralston is trapped in a canyon in Arizona with his arm wedged between the canyon wall and a boulder. He has half a bottle of water, a pair of wire cutters, a video camera, and nobody around to hear him.considering the hype for this film and the intensity of the premise, I was a little disappointed at the execution. To put it as literally as I can, director Danny Boyle takes a story that is potentially terrifying and he turns it into a music video. It moves too fast and contains disorienting flashbacks, clumsy cuts, over exaggerated music ques, and misuse of split screening. There is little sense of subjectivity or patience to the film. It shows a lack of faith in the attention span of its audience.James Franco is easily more vibrant than anything in his previous career, but he doesn't embody the character as well as I had hoped. I didn't sense the desperation of the situation in his performance. He plays it quiet when it should be loud, and sometimes vice versa. Another problem with the character is that Boyle cuts around him too much.As many mistakes as I felt Boyle made, He hasn't yet disappointed me as a photographer. Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire, and even The Beach (which was slop) were vibrant and well shot. 127 Hours is easily the most vibrant of them all, making effective use of colour temperature, scope, and camera angles. One angle in particular worth noting is the intimacy of being inside Aron's video camera. There is also a memorable moment where we follow a rusty tool as it digs into his bloodstream. This brings me to my next point.The much discussed arm cutting scene is seriously over hyped. I can name a dozen films that will make you more squeamish. Therefore, if this is the reason you've chosen to avoid 127 Hours then it's the wrong reason. A better reason might be to mark me when I tell you that it's a rather miscalculated experience, good in parts but too shallow and flashy for its own good.",6,3,5,11 June 2011
Creed," Pretty much a knock out.
","'If I could give up everything to buy one more day with my wife, I would.'This line really stuck with me. It may be the most earnest thing that Stallone has said in a movie in (at least) twenty years.Creed is the kind of idea that you would think would never get made. It loosely hinges on the Rocky franchise by telling the story of Apollo Creed's son, who finds a trainer in none other than Rocky Balboa. Rocky is the one role that Stallone was born to play. He elevates the movie significantly, but he is not the star. Much of the films dramatic weight rests on the shoulders of Michael B. Jordan, and fortunately he carries it with pride.Creed breaks from the tradition of previous sports movies. It has a happy ending, but not the one that you saw coming. The film puts realism before gimmick every step of the way, making it worthy of praise.",8,1,1,1 June 2017
Constantine," Demonically sloppy
","Sometimes it is said about a director that there is a little kid in them; something which drives their creative energy, giving them the ability to make good entertainment. George Lucas would be a key example.Anyway, here is the point I am getting at. The makers of Constantine, have no such 'little kids' in their imagination. This feature is a clunky, overlong, and surprising dull piece of work. It contains a vastly underwritten screenplay, an utterly sucky performance from Keanu Reeves, and most frustratingly of all, there is no action. As dull as it is, I suppose it has a few sporadic horror charms which may appeal to some, but not me. Every twenty minutes, Keanu Reeves gets to punch or shoot something freaky, but it never lasts long. We also get to see hell a couple of times (or one vision of it), not to mention Tilda Swinton playing a boy (probably wearing a green screen bra to generate the same kind of effect as a wire removal, if you get my meaning) This aside, Constantine has nothing to offer. It ends on a far too rushed and incomplete note, which just cries out for sequel, something it doesn't doesn't deserve. I feel more than a bit cheated by Constantine, it doesn't deliver. Do yourself a favour and skip it.",4,1,3,30 May 2010
Ed Wood," Smart story of a famed moron
","If Uwe Boll makes another film he might steal the title, but so far Edward D. Wood Jr. is the biggest dumbshit to step behind a camera, common knowledge. If the Razzies began thirty years earlier, he'd win them all. It is ironic then that he is gone but NOT forgotten. Forty years later, a film maker by the name of Tim Burton (who needs no introduction) began making a name for himself. Contrary to what many think, Burton is not always colourful and bright. His early work is very dark, in fact his only film with a warm heart was Big Fish. Edward Scissorhands maybe, but it was still a dark tale. Burton knows exactly what he is doing. To make a movie about B- movies is not enough, the film itself has to look like a b-movie. The first step of course is too put it in black and white. The next step is to have everyone overact, which rarely works, but it's perfect here. Then add a lot of satire, such as the kind of random music quese that draw attention to themselves.Few actors are as diverse as Johnny Depp. He truly captures the essence of a moron, but he is almost upstaged by Martin Landau, as Bela Lugosi. The movie covers only a short chapter in Ed Wood's life, but probably the most important. In 1952, with funding of the LA Baptist church, he made Plan 9 from Outer Space (also needs no introduction). It was a triumphant moment for Ed Wood, (or so he thought). The movie ends there, but you won't forget it.Though it is not Tim Burton's Cinema D'auteur, if looked at in a different perspective from his other films, one could argue that this is his smartest film.",8,0,0,3 April 2010
Terminator Salvation," Appropriately action laden and subsequently stupid (but a step up from 3)
","After four entries, I'm afraid Terminator no longer makes sense. The whole time travel thing has gotten so ridiculous that attempting to descibe it hurts my brain. In Terminator, Our hero (Kyle Reese) was sent back from the future by John Connor, to ensure that his mother lived to give birth to him. This is understandable enough, and the Terminator ended up being a fine film.Now, just imagine taking something like this and making it ten times more convoluted, so much so that it interferes with the plot and degrades the movie. This is exactly what happen in Terminator Salvation. That and bad acting result in a pretty mediocre movieAt least it could have been worse. Terminator Salvation is more than a small step up from the almost unwatchable Terminator 3. It feels like something a bit more fresh, and less like a rehashing of previous entries (which terminator 3 was) The first half of Terminator Salvation is actually pretty good containing plenty of adrenaline without ove4r doing it, but the film doesn't get better, it gets worse. I found myself loosing interest rather quickly, in part because of the growing sense of idiocy, but more importantly, because like so many summer blockbusters, this is ultimitely a shallow enterprise, hard to care for. James Cameron invested some time is giving us characters; this film has cardboard cut outs.The end result while not terrible (and sometimes very thrilling) does not do enough for me to wanna recommend it.",6,1,4,28 June 2010
The Last Song," Corny, but occasionally cute
","The Last Song is intended for a very particular age group, and I am not among them. Annoying though it can be for corniness and underwriting, The Last Song doesn't end up being a terrible movie. At times it can be cute, but it takes a while to get to that part. The Last Song falls into a number of melodramatic traps, one of which is the 'break up make up' phase which happens one too many times here, leaving The Last Song a bit difficult to take seriously. The film kind of bounces back and forth with tones, while following a familiar teen romance structure. Needless to say this is not an adult movie, but it might be better for the kids (just not the little ones)",6,1,6,22 February 2011
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Hellboy oh boy
","A significant step up from the first; the wit, action, emotional elements, and creativity make Hellboy II superior to the mighty 'Dark Knight' (king of the 2008 summer blockbusters.) in some ways, and the film never takes itself too seriously, which means that the stupidity is acceptable. Prince Nuada wants to break an ancient truce that his race made with humanity long ago, and release an army of mechanical golden warriors that was built for his king father, but it lay dormant once the truce was made. Nuada seeks to recover the royal crown needed to command the army and destroy humanity. This is where Hellboy and his team come in. The rest of the story sort of falls into play from there.Hellboy II is a very competent superhero story, until the climactic twenty minutes come about. At this point, Hellboy and his friends have found the location of the golden army which has been awoken by Nuada and is ready to crush the world. Five minutes later, all the soldiers are asleep again because of a very silly turn of events that will leave the audience rather disappointed. The ending is a short cliffhanger, and due to the sufficient success of the movie, another sequel is likely to be made.Even if you didn't like the original 'Hellboy', you will probably enjoy this one.",7,2,3,20 March 2009
Hotel Rwanda," Schindler's List in Africa
","What is the definition of a hero?Naturally a hero is one who saves lives, but with a particular state of mind. Fictional heroes (including macho cops and super heroes) save lives but not in a moving way. They risk nothing and have no fear. They come to the resucue and a crowd cheers them on, before going back to their lives, not realizing that they could have been the ones in distress. Real heroes are people like Paul Rusesabagina, an African version of Oskar Schindler. He risked his life and everything he had, to save many lives out of love and selflessness. The tiny, internationally neglected nation of Rwanda, in central Africa, is made up of two peoples, Hutus and Totsis. They are rivals. With the help of the UN, they almost made a peace treaty in 1994. On the day that was to happen, the Totsi rebels shot down the Hutu president. The Hutus then went on a massive manslaughter, taking no Tutsi prisoners, just hacking them down in cold blood (especially children, to prevent future generations) Paul Rusesabagina was the manager of one of the most luxurious Rwandan hotels. He was Hutu but his wife was Tutsi. By bribing the police (with what little he had) and thinking on the fly day and night amidst the gun fire that was erupting all over Rwanda, Paul was able to save the lives of 1200 innocent Tutsis, until the UN was able to transport them to freedom.Rwanada is a sad story, not just because of what happened there, but because it took too long for the UN to give sufficient aid. The country was ignored by the rest of the world, practically dismissed as a speck of dirt.The movie is not quite as heartbreaking as Schindler's List, but it is almost flawless. It feels like there are a couple of unnecessary sequences, but no movie is truly perfect. Sensational acting across the board except for Nick Nolte, who delivers his lines as if he is in a gangster movie. Probably a miscasting.So once again, I ask you, what is a hero? Well, here is an example of a real one.",8,0,0,30 October 2009

Hal Moore played by Mel Gibson the day before he and his outfit set off across the Pacific for the front lines of Vietnam. Easily the highlight line of the movie, it would be easy enough to see this as the kind of cheesy bravado that romanticizes war heroes, but We Were Soldiers gets away with it by being everything but romantic. There are moments where the images of blood alone may be enough to summon misty eyes.The movie doesn't bring anything new to the genre, but it is a visually genuine and visceral depiction of battle and survival. The American invasion of Communist Vietnam is something that to this day, virtually nobody is proud of so. All the better it is that the film has no political bias or stance on the conflict. It even does something to the contrary. The Vietcong 'charlie' are not bad guys, they are merely soldiers fighting for their homeland.The firefighting is quite exhausting but it is the individual moments in-between the bullets that lift We Were Soldiers out of the chaos. Director Randall Wallace adds a curious scoring touch laying 'Sgt. Mackenzie.' (a Scottish WWI ballad), over the first moments of the final assault.The irony is that this is a song about the will to die for country; not a compatible motif with 'nam,Regardless of its political correctness, the words end up being less important than the somber and haunting tone of the melody. Our characters are not fighting for country, they are fighting for each other, and to get home to their loved ones. Every now and then, Wallace cuts from the front lines back to America to focus on Moore's Wife and the wives of his comrades. Day to day they live in fear of receiving a certain letter from the government regarding their husbands. The impact of these scenes on the picture is rather minimal, but it serves to remind us of what is really at stake, while showcasing one of Madaline Stowe's better performances. She barely has to say a word, you can read the vulnerability in her eyes.True to his word, Hal Moore is the first to step off the field, and there is a good shot of his boot coming of the grass and into the chopper that will take him back to the home of the brave. The final sequences are heavy on unspoken melodrama, over emphasizing the loss of life. The film doesn't rely on our knowledge of the history to add to the tragedy. It is a story about brothers and comrades who fought together and died together.",8,2,3,19 June 2017
Dear John," Sometimes touching, though rather uninspired
","John returns to his coastal hometown after completing a tour overseas with the troops. One day on the beach, He meets Savanah, the new face on the block. After two 'magical' weeks together, it's back to school for her, and back to the battlefield for John. The only thing keeping them together is pen and paper, while the forces of time threaten to split them apartI know now that nothing Nicholas Sparks writes will be inspired, and not even a veteran like Lasse Hallstrom can make a strong movie from his material. We've seen this kind of story before, though usually in historical settings such as with Cold Mountain or Atonement. The history helps a bit. In the late 20th century, there is no real sense of distance between the two lovers. It's a smaller world. Montage editing plays a key role here, and to some degree it achieves effectiveness, while at the same time, it keeps Dear John from going in depth. As a studio production, intended for a pg-13 audience, the film unfortunately must keep within the public attention span. It's a body film not a brainy film, one intended to provoke tears, not thoughts.On an emotional level, Dear John works a bit, but only a bit. The roles are somewhat beyond the acting range of Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum, but a few sparks fly between them. I've seen better and I've seen worse. Dear John is probably good for a weep, but not a huge one. otherwise, it won't be of much use.",6,0,0,9 May 2011
Crash," Slightly incomplete but pretty good
","Crash is not a great movie, but it is pretty good (sometimes very). The problem when you think about it is obvious, it is too short. The scenario gives us a large and varied handful of people, perhaps too many to fit into a one hundred minute story. As a result, Crash feels a little underdeveloped, and pretty contrived. Despite that, the drama is solid, the acting is superb, and the movie's intentions are noble. Probably a film worth seeing.Set up a little like Pulp Fiction, with shorter scenes, Crash intertwines the lives of various people living in the darker parts of Los Angeles. Among them: a racist but dedicated cop, a middle eastern shop keeper on the verge of bankruptcy, a pair of street thieves, and a young couple going through marriage trouble, after receiving police abuse one night.Crash is not a movie to fall in love with, but it is a respectable motion picture that is able to make do with what it has.",8,0,5,6 February 2010
The Beach," This tropical adventure achieves practically nothing
","Watching the Beach is like looking at a postcard from a tropical island: it is a pretty picture, but it is also paper thin, and nothing happens in it. This motion picture left me disappointed. It starts off promisingly, but with each passing chapter (sometimes pair of chapters) the story grows more dull. The editing is clunky, the script is underwritten, the acting is more wooden than the trunk of a palm tree, and the ending is rushed and anti-climactic. The only thing this motion picture really has to sell are a handful of nice shots and a good score. Judging by the sloppiness of the story telling, it is clear that The Beach is definitely one of those book adapted movies that butchered its source material. It is a story that could've amounted to so much more. There is too much narration and not enough intelligent dialogue, and every now and then, just when you think the film is becoming something good, it changes again. Individual scenes work well on their own, but not in the context of the whole story. Take for instance a love scene between Leo Dicaprio and the french girl he invites on his trip to a lost paradise in the South Pacific. It's a well directed charming little sequence, but unfortunately, that particular character relationship ends with the scene. Another problem with the Beach is that it requires a strong compelling lead, which it does not have. Perhaps Leo was just too inexperienced as an actor at the time. The character feels like a nobody, and his persona is sold to us almost entirely through his narrative monologues which feature pretty scrappy lines of dialogue.In the end, the Beach sets out with ambition but the trip is unsatisfying. It is weak and ineffective, and if it does nothing else, at least it will remind you of how far both Leo and director Danny Boyle have come since this.",4,2,4,14 August 2010
The Expendables," Just not bad...(lots of muscle, very little brains)
","The Expendables is spectacular action alongside amateurish film making. I had a professor ask once rhetorically; why if these movies can afford to invest money/time in CGI, pyrotechnics, and spectacular stunts can they not afford invest time into screen writing. What hurts the Expendables most is non-existent characterization which leads to wooden acting across the board and a plot that makes no sense.You are probably gonna leave the theatre not remembering a single character's name. Truth be told, it doesn't matter. Stalone, Stathum, Rourke, and everyone else are essentially playing themselves. The Expendables is a high school reunion of 1980's and early 90's Hollywood heroes. One of the film's more potent traits is that it is very macho. One could say that The Expendables celebrates the human body, by exposing its full potential. Indeed given the choreography, and camera work, Ludgern might be able to take on the Hulk. So as a summer blockbuster, what would make the Expendables any more memorable than anything else with guns and smoke. Well sure it has a dozen action stars instead of one, but what deserves some credit is the effective staging of all the fight scenes. This motion picture requires some heavy choreography to sync up a combination of gun fire at sixty different ranges, flying knives, Juno, and Kung fu. It also helps a little recognizing that The Expendables is not willing to go sissy and submit to the ratings board. A lot of blood gets spilled in the Expendables. Sometimes it happens preposterous ways, which should probably have been exploited for humour. I liked the way Stallone can take of a guy's head which a six inch blade.To bring a dozen action heroes together is one thing, but making them shine is another. Stallone's screenplay doesn't give anyone any room to grow. Mickey Rourke gets to deliver a fairly extensive speech and Stathum gets the honour of having the movies' only sub plot (dealing with his former lover) but nobody else has any thing to work with. Indeed the Expendables, despite packing a punch remains a pretty shallow experience. The best I can say about it is that it is fun in the moment, but silly and not super memorable.",6,0,3,19 November 2010
Tangled," Long and flowing
","There's a kind of tenderness to behind Tangled that almost works on it's own with out the need for the so called 'post-modern' approach to fairy tales which brings out the cunning above the sentimentality. Tangled works either way. The film trusts it's material an its audience enough to embrace sentimentality, yet there is also a sense of modernity to the film which gives it that much of an edge. This is one of those a movie where the damsel in distress saves the dashing hero. It's cute as a romance, It's effective as part comedy, it feels organic as a musical (capturing Disney's better days). The ending feels a little cheap, but that's typical of fantasies, and I suppose there is no need to get picky. Tangled works, quite well.",8,2,5,27 March 2011
Interstellar," Noble, visually memorable, clunky and hardly stellar but passable.
","There is no question that Interstellar is the kind of over ambitious movie that will polarize audiences, but I'll give it credit where it is do.A strong first act is followed by a clumsy and dull second act followed by a climax which is enough of a mind-f**k to partially re-engage you. This is a medium good film, but far from a great one.As far as the cast goes, Interstellar gets fair performances out of Matthew Mcconaughey and John Lithgow. Jessica Chastain is also strong yet strangely distant. Anne Hathoway meanwhile leaves us in the cold. She is as bland as she was in Dark Knight Rises. Nolan as a writer continues to have trouble delivering strong female characters.The dialogue is not the film's strong suit. It is heavy on scientific jargon and forced sentiment and unless you are watching the film with surround sound, almost half the conversation is inaudible. Hanz Zimmer delivers a distinctive score but one that is so overbearing that whole lines of script get lost behind it.The scenes in space are filmed quite admirably. This is movie where you get lost in the cosmos rather than admiring of the CGI quality. Special effects are not meant to be the star of the show. Interstellar sends its characters to planets that resemble real landscapes on Earth, and it doesn't need to dress them up or add flair to make you feel like you are light years from home.I cannot say that Interstellar is not an endurance test, because it is. Though not as exhausting as say the last half of Return of the King, Interstellar is burdened by a very dull middle section with questionable editing decisions and a waste of Matt Damon. The Climax is highly cerebral but might leave you annoyed depending on how hard you try to deconstruct it.The films heart is in the right place. It is an ambitious film with some unforgettable scenes, but it won't age as well as Nolan Batman trilogy, and is an acquired taste that won't be for everyone.",7,0,1,19 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not Terrible, but certainly the weakest Star Wars entry.
","Star Wars for most people is one of those things that you adore as a kid but you grow out of when you reach adulthood. Personally I still salute it, and what it has done for children's imagination. I was eleven when I saw Attack of the Clones, and even at that age I was smart enough to know what was wrong with this film. Arguably the worst Star Wars feature, Episode 2 is cheezy, badly written, and kinda boring. The action scenes are too short, the romance between Anakyn and Padme, is utterly wooden, and the attempts at humour are pretty feeble.Even with all this, the film is not terrible, and parts of it are captivating. Christopher Lee, is the only good performance in the movie. He has an epic stage presence. We also get to see Yoga come to life a bit more. In Episode 2 he feels less like a Muppet, and more like a Jedi master, especially when he draws his lightsaber and goes into Bruce Lee mode. There is no reason not to see Episode 2, if you are working your way through Star Wars for the first time, but I'm warning you not so set your expectations too high.",Null,1,4,1 May 2010
Romeo + Juliet," Romeo + Juliet + Luhrmann = crap
","I watched this for about twenty minutes then I walked out, I made it up to Act 2, the end of the masked ball (for those who have read the play). I know it's probably wrong to review a movie when you've watched less than a quarter of It, but I have to warn viewers, stay away. Baz Luhrmann's film takes Romeo and Juliet out of Verona, Italy four hundred years ago, and into the present day in what is supposed to be Atlanta or one of the southeastern U.S. cities. The film looks impressive, with accomplished set and costume design, but not for a moment does this feel like Shakespeare. You cannot take 16th century dialog and give it to contemporary character types played by talentless actors, it sounds dreadful. Hearing a ruffian American kid, say 'Do you bite your thumb at us sir.' as if it's status quo in modern speech, is an insult to the great playwrite. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes may look cute together but boy do they stink at acting here. I imagine if I had made it to the ending, I would have cried with laughter not sorrow. Next to Franco Zeffirelli's film from 1968, or any other Shakespeare movie for that matter, this one is a a turkey.If you have any respect for Shakespeare, do not see this movie.",Null,2,4,20 July 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," Standard Popcorn flick with lots of red white and blue.
","As an origin story, Captain America is interesting in that is takes a surprisingly short amount of time to turn its character into the hero, whereas X-Men first class and Green Lantern (other blockbusters of the same summer) needed almost their entire running length to do this. The problem with the Captain America approach is that once the human becomes superhuman, he ceases to become a character. Captain America is a well executed action movie, relying on choreography not CGI to sell the product, and as a story, it gets from A-Z in a rather fluid fashion. The problem is that it is an action movie full of boring people. Nobody, with the exception of Hayley Atwell (representing feminism in the WWII war effort) is all that interesting, least of all Chris Evans as the hero. As depicted by the unfolding of the plot here, The improbability that this guy would become Captain America is surprisingly high. If the movie took itself a bit less seriously, this might be easier to swallow. The film comes with a lame and rather unsatisfactory ending. Needless to say, it is an ending that opens the doors for a sequel. While I wont argue that Captain America doesn't deserve one, it may be not a memorable enough film to make you want more. It's a standard popcorn flick, no more no less.",6,0,1,1 April 2012
Armageddon," Preposterous...but surprisingly thrilling
","An asteroid the size of Texas is on its way to Earth, and when it impacts in eighteen days, it will be the end of life as we know it. A team of professional oil drillers are put through NASA training as the first step of an elaborate plan to a) fly up and land on the asteroid b) drill an 800 foot hole and c) stuff it with enough dynamite to blow it before it enters the atmosphere. As much as we all love to hate Michael Bay, he has occasionally gotten some things right. Armageddon as dumb as it is, is surprisingly exciting. It's been a while since I've seen it, and while I won't argue that it's great, it's not so easy to forget. When I was younger I was a fan of disaster movies. They prove popular at the box office but most of them don't shine for with the critics. Armaggedon is not for intelligent viewers....and I am an intelligent viewer. One of the movies most distinctive items, is the result of a collaboration between the art and effects departments. As you comb the rugged surface of the asteroid (sometiems on foot, sometimes on rover) you feel like you are in the underworld. There is something kind of romantic or ethereal about Armageddon's primeval appearance.One of the advantages (for the viewer) of being in space I suppose is that it forces Michael Bay to cut down on explosions (seeing as there is no air in a vacuum for combustion). It means that him and screen writer J.J. Abrahams must turn to more effective devices for generating adrenaline. Michael Bay in Armageddon almost gets away with being non-gratuitous, but not quite. There is a teaser sequence in the first act where New York gets bombarded by a smaller meteor shower which as a plot element serves no function other than giving scientists the hint that something bigger is on the way. He should have let the movie build towards its spectacle rather than rush to it.Armageddon for the most part does what it sets out to do. For that it deserves some credit. Most of the people you go to will probably bash it, but I can certainly recommend it on the grounds of an adrenaline rush (just don't watch it on your Ipod)",Null,0,2,19 November 2010
The Village," Beautiful, Eerie, and psychologically frustrating
","As I was exiting the theatre when the Village ended, I was not happy. It wasn't so much that I was disappointed, but rather that I was annoyed. I expected a ghost story, and what I saw was more of a psychologically themed, semi-thriller, with a lame third act twist that almost turns the Village into two different movies. The second time I viewed it was years later, and somehow, I think I saw it in new light when I realized what Shyamalan was trying to do. The Village is enjoyable if approached a certain way. There is something kind of primal and antique about the nature of the film which is distinctive. It is fairly aesthetic for a horror movie, yet there is the catch. This isn't really a legitimate horror movie, and if you attend it with that mind set, you may be disappointed.Set in late 19th century Pennsylvania, the story takes us to a charming little village in the woods, and introduces us to our prinicle characters. We have Ivy Walker, and her two best friends, Luscious Hunt and Noah, who is a harmless but unstable. The village remains at peace, just as long as no one enters the woods which surround it. Lurking within, are 'Creatures they do not speak of'. At the halfway point a violent incident, leaves Luscious on death's door step. With his condition almost beyond help, Ivy wants to travel through the woods to fetch medicine from 'the towns' on the other side. The Village are seemingly unwilling. There reason's for disliking the towns have remained secret, but now could be the appropriate time to reveal the truth, when lives are at stake.With its beautiful score, and photography and occasionally cute banter, The Village is quite charming, but when it wants to, it can turn quite eerie as well. The film sets itself up well, and as it progresses it gives us an exiting idea of what is to come, and then suddenly, it flips its wheels on us. The twist that Shyamalan throws in at the beginning of the climactic act, almost literally turns the premise of this film into an illusion. It is presented in a way feels sloppy and not very clever. Depending on how you look at it, the twist could be a positive or a negative. Seeing as it spoils the chance for a dramatic climax, I call it a negative. It is clear however, that the Village has something to say about human nature. Shyamalan wants us to ask ourselves, what is it that we choose to do when we are driven to question whether there is any good in life. The village in the end is kind of a morality story. It turns out not to be a bad movie, but it does something that cheats everyone in the audience who goes into the film expecting edge of seat suspense as good as that in Sixth sense or Signs.",Null,1,1,16 May 2010
The Revenant," Leo commands an empty landscape, Overrated survival film
","The Revenant is a strong movie for the first half hour or so and then it reduces to a series of 'greatest hits' moments from survivalist films that we have seen before. This movie is about sixty minutes of material padded to two hours plus, and is too emotionally distant to be worth the endurance that it asks of the viewer.With that in mind, the film has strong points. This is NOT remotely an award winning performance from Leo Dicaprio, but he is indeed commanding. He is one of those actors who can make himself seem bigger through his physical performance, and Leo has never felt this naturally big before. Tom Hardy also brings some a-game and knows how to be threatening through small nuances in his demeanour. The Revenant is a well shot movie, making great use of camera work and the same wide lens effects that aided Birdman but the problem is that mostly there is nothing to look at but scenery. Leo wanders through the wilderness for a long time, leaving the audience with nothing but a chilly feeling. The Revenant is meant to be a tale of revenge but there is no sense of drive or character motivation which makes it worth investing in. It's a clunky, and unmemorable film.",6,1,2,19 January 2017
Pitch Black," Enjoyable, but something's missing
","Pitch Black is entertaining, but it feels underdone . It is a great looking film, no doubt there. Twohy has a great eye for color shape and texture, and he directs the film quite nicely, with a mindset toward mystique and subtlety, (which helps generate shock moments, because they come harder). However, there are still a lot of blanks to fill in. The storyline is shallow, and the characters (despite being likable people) are poorly defined, especially Vin Diesel. There is also a fairly strong sense of anti-climax. When all is said and done, Pitch Black is entertaining as a sci-fi, but it could probably use some energy, and a slightly stronger screenplay.",6,0,3,3 August 2010
Split," It's McAvoy's movie, but he's standing on thin ice.
","When the Visit came out, it seemed like Shyamalan was coming out of rock bottom. With Split, he shows a continuum of that momentum. However, unlike the Visit, this is not an entertaining movie.Split is the story (actually to call it a story is being a bit generous) of Kevin Crumb, a man with 24 personalities. In the opening scene, he highjacks a car, and kidnaps three girls. They are kept in a locked room, in what looks like a renovated heritage building. Every now and then the door opens and the girls get a visit from one of Kevin's, alter egos. The movie intercuts between the girls escape attempts and Kevin's session with his doctor.The fundamental problem with Split is that there is really no story to tell. It feels like an isolated chapter of a larger narrative, and indeed it is, (tying in to Unbreakable and the follow up movie Glass). The editing is erratic, including flashbacks into the life of the principle heroine, whom the movie is not about. On top of that, the whole catalyst of the plot. (the kidnapping) is never coherently explained.The movie is at its most compelling in the smaller scenes, such as when the camera is on McAvoy and his doctor. We see a character who is paradoxically fighting to keep his secrets yet at the same time to reveal them.In the end, Split is watchable because of McAvoy. As he ping pongs between his personalities and emotions, he creates a 'poly-character' that is simultaneously whimsical, and frightening, even sympathetic at times. The personalities are self aware that they exist to 'protect' their host. Whether or not this is an accurate picture of a mental condition is sometimes questionable. The line between mental ability and supernatural is raised in a rather expository (and obviously fore shadowing) scene midway through the picture. The 24th personality of 'The Beast' (yet to be seen) keeps getting mentioned in conversation, which unfortunately is the movies only dramatic momentum. It leads to a rather cliched horror film climax, in underground tunnels, with the heroine's clothes getting progressively shredded (another cliche).
In the end Split is a mediocre movie about a fascinating character.",5,0,0,25 December 2019
American Psycho," Deadly movie
","I have not read the novel, but I couldn't care less, American Psycho is a pretty sensational picture horror picture. The whole thing is seductive and weird, sexually twisted and extreme, but strangely intelligent. You can interpret this film many ways, but I guarantee you'll come away with something from watching one unstable man played brilliantly by Christian Bale, who is the most interesting fictional killer since Hannibal Lector. This is not a fun slice and dice picture, so do not go into this expecting a Friday the 13th or a Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Like Alfred Hitchcock's 'regular' Psycho, this is deep, thought provoking horror.",8,0,1,24 July 2009
Knowing," Shocking
","When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as another special effects oriented piece of Hollywood junk, but when I heard that it came from Alex Proyas, the skilled Sci-fi director behind The Crow and Dark City I gave it a shot. Well It's certainly not junk. Up until the ending, Knowing is a well paced, fairly emotional and very startling picture.The premise is based around one of the greatest scientific controversies, whether the universe is random, or if things happen for a reason. Nicholas Cage is John Koestler, an astrophysicist, a widower and a highly depressed man. On the day of his son's graduation, the school digs up a time capsule buried fifty years ago. Inside are dozens of envelopes containing student's illustrations of what the future would look like. John's son brings home one of the envelopes, but instead of a drawing inside, there is a page full of random numbers. That night John discovers a sequence in the numbers, which reveals a deadly fact. Something with the potential to the whole planet.From the look of things, It feels like Alex Proyas is desperate to make the biggest natural disaster film of all time. It is certainly one of the most complex. The elaborate plot does not harm the flow of the film too much until the concluding twenty minutes which are visually stunning but ridiculous and quite irrelevant to everything that proceeded it. The film is absurd yes, but it's darkness was strangely compelling; almost in a Twilight Zone kind of way, Knowing is a film I would recommend if you seek a sci-fi film that is more mystery than action driven.",7,19,36,13 July 2009
Hugo," Pleasant, but unfortunately too modest and lacking ambition
","Tackling 3D for the first time, I think Scorsese has hit the ball out of the park with Hugo, his film was gorgeous. Unfortunately he forgot to give us a compelling story. Hugo is a noble film, but it is never quite sure what kind of film it wants to be. It is a little too mature to be a kids movie, yet it's too cartoonish to be an adult movie. One minute, it is played as a fantasy in the kind of world where the moon is bigger than the Eiffel Tower, and the next minute the film is played realistically; a serious biography of one of cinema's pioneers. Indeed Hugo's best quality after it's look, is its educational factor. How Ironic it is to be watching bits of hundred year old George Melies films on a cinematic format that was almost invented yesterday. The photography was diverse and spectacular, the characters were charming and quirky, but in the end, the movie just wasn't compelling enough. I went in expecting to laugh and cry in all the right places, and I didn't. I guess that's more Spielberg's terrain; Scorsese is much colder than that of course. Hugo is pleasant, but it's not a great movie",6,17,28,2 December 2011
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," How dare they!?
","Considering what happens at the end of 'T2', everything that happens in Terminator 3 is impossible (don't even get me started). This fact alone should be a good enough reason why not to make this movie and rob the other two films of their dignity. Terminator 3 does practically everything wrong, but the worst thing it does is leave the story open for Terminator 4 (or what we now know as Terminator Salvation)The best way to summarize Terminator 3 is to say that this movie shows us how the war between man and machine begins, and how John Conner becomes the one who is destined to save mankind. This may sound like an exciting premise, but it results in a movie that does not belong anywhere near Jim Cameron's genius creations. The script is rubbish. It literally steals plot points from Terminator and T2, and then attempts to make a better movie out of them by adding more mindless action and special effects, neither of which is remotely useful to the story. Instead of being thrilling and epic, the action sequences are confusing and rather dull. The acting is terrible, and the characterization is even worse. The protagonists do virtually nothing but fight, and fight, and fight, and try to survive. It all happens so fast with no character interaction, no suspense, no adventure, and no emotion. Terminator 3 isn't worth your time.",3,2,5,24 March 2009
The Shining," Perfect on most grounds but poor on a couple
","A fine novel and an equally enjoyable feature film. Though not Kubrick's best, I think it is the best example of his style. It features all his director trademarks clearly, including great art and bad acting, although the former outweighs the latter.Writer Jack Torrance has taken a job as the winter caretaker for the overlook hotel which is about to close up for the season (because the annual snow makes it impossible to get in or out)JAck moves in with his wife Wendy and his son Danny, At first they are enjoying the godly hotel which they have to their selves, but it is soon to become a nightmare. Something about the place is starting to have an affect on Jack mindset. The isolation and frustration with his work, makes him delusional and he starts having hallucinations of friends and hotel staff who are telling him to kill his family. It is all in his mind or is it real. With nobody around for miles, and bad weather approaching, how will Wendy keep herself and Danny safe from impending doom?Kubricks mise-en-scene is quite distinctive. He strikes me as a detailed set designer, and a director intent on making his environment weird elaborate or complex. Just look at the neon clubs in Clockwork Orange or the masked ball in Eyes Wide Shut. The Overlook hotel is also a great piece of production design. In fact it may be the biggest hotel I have seen in a movie. (shot from the inside that is). The photography is highly evocative, and features a handful of memorable shots and camera tricks. Kubrick likes long duration.For the most part the film is a pretty honourable adaptation of the novel, except for the climax, which Kubrick completely rewrites. I guess he found King's approach too conventional and 'happy ending' like. King's approach was better. Climax of the movie involves a chase scene that feels highly uninventive, rather over the top, and dragging on for a little too long. I've never liked Jack Nicholson much, but for the sloppy performance he gives here, I give equal blame to Kubrick. The way I see it, he probably gave Nicholson only two words of direction...'go nuts'. This is exactly what happens. Never before has Nicholson been so far over the top. Shelley Duvall is equally poor, and for about three quarters of the movie, she delivers her lines with the same ridiculous expression on her face.Aside from these problems, I would call the Shining an impressive piece of horror movie making. Is it a great movie? not quite but it is one worth wathcing, although I would recommend the book first.",Null,0,1,24 November 2009
Wanted," Near Hollywood garbage
","If you want action, Wanted has it, but action alone is not enough, Wanted is also frustrating. The plot is awkward and totally unbelievable, the action scenes defy every law of physics making it tricky to suspend disbelief. Sometimes they even provoke unintentional laughter. The characterization is rubbish, and the script is full of silly lines. Worst of all, the ending leaves you feeling cheated. When all is said and done, Wanted is just a typical over adrenaline rush, where the only real talent is in the visual and sound effects department who are virtually unnoticed by the masses paying to watch this, while Angelina Jolie gets all the attention in a razzie worthy performance. Skip this movie.The story dumb all the way through, but for the first two thirds Wanted provides just enough (of something) to keep you from walking out. Yes it is slick, and things do start to build towards what promises to be something epic. That is where the film kicks the viewer in the teeth. The climactic act takes some lame twists and has a disappointing ending. There are several questions you might have when the film is over, but you may not care enough to want to ask them, depending on how annoyed you are with the movie. If a sequel gets made, I may forgive Wanted for the ending, but that would hardly cover it. As it stands right now, I'm afraid I cannot give it a pass.",5,2,4,10 February 2010
Salt," Good in parts, but feels silly, derivative and too open ended
","Salt sounds like a pretty good deal, what it delivers is just mildly good. As is typical of everything Kurt Wimmer writes, Salt mistakes street smart for intelligent smart. I thought this was pretty dumb, maybe even Wimmer's dumbest movie yet. Okay fine, Ultraviolet was pretty silly, but then again, it was a b-movie right, (this isn't)Salt has a few good action scenes, which work well individually, but the film in its entirety doesn't amount to much. It feels rushed, shallow, devoid of common sense, and has an ending which makes the story feel vastly incomplete; perhaps a tell tale sign of a sequel to come.Director Phillip Noyce knows how to Make Angelina Jolie look good on camera, but she isn't much of a character. Her performance is a huge step up from her last action film Wanted, but even so, her function here is not too dissimilar. She has little to do outside of running around and killing people.Treated as an extended chase scene, Salt could easily get an A+, but as a hundred minute story, it feels rather feeble. It is a derivative spy/thriller which is usually slick, and certainly not dull, but its superficiality and general lack of brains make it difficult to appreciate to the full.",6,1,4,8 August 2010
Step Up 2: The Streets," Step DOWN!
","The more flips or spins or twirls, or shakes, Step up 2 does, the more time the audience has to reflect on the fact that this amateurish enterprise is missing everything elseStep Up 2 makes every story-telling mistake possible: Dialogue driven, over-exposition, Flat characters, contrived plot devices, silly lines, and an insulting misuse of montage. Step Up wasn't so well written itself, but at least it look like the product of a filmmaker. This looks like the product of a hack. It is striped to the bone of story, and over stuffed with dance numbers that look choppy and uneven, like a cobbled together mix of every dance style ever. Step Up 2 doesn't make street dancing look impressive at all. Step up 2, as promising as it may sound, is surprisingly inept. everything goes to waste including the two hours in the life of whoever foolishly chooses to approach this picture",3,1,1,5 November 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Ethan Hunt keeps plugging away
","Though not as visually dazzling as Ghost Patrol, Mission Impossible 5 still passes with flying colours. It does exactly what you expect it to do, which makes it as good to watch as it is forgettable after ward.There are some sexy action pieces in this entry, complemented by Robert Elswit's crisp photography. A long sequence involves Ethan Hunt and his team have to crack a digitally advanced security system, with lots of digital projection. The cyber-tech in the movie is a little too extraordinary because it leans too close to science fiction. In terms of the cast, the highlight is Simon Pegg. He bring a good dose of intelligent whimsy to a picture that is a little hard to take seriously. Tom Cruise does what he does best, although probably not doing as many of his own stunts as he used to. The baddies are all one- dimensional, but that isn't unusual in this franchise. Mission Impossible may be coming of age but it's not a dead franchise yet.",7,0,0,1 June 2017
Dunkirk," One of the years best
","Dunkirk is a director's achievement.It's in the way that Nolan stages a handful of brutally suspenseful sequences of peril with an unobtrusive grace that so many directors lack. He allows the camera to linger when others may have cut. He knows that there is no rush to get to the next scene or set up. The characters are stranded on the bleach shores of northern France. They are not going anywhere, so why should we. We can feel their frustration at being a stones throw away from England while the Nazi fighters and u-boat sink every vessel that attempts to get them off the beach.Nolan has a rare ability to make the audience feel small though his placement of the camera and the depth of his frame. The wide shots are stunning, but without being distracting. That sea and the sky go on forever, which is as beautiful as it is intimidating because certain supporting characters are racing the clock to get to reach that spot on the distant horizon.There are certain sequences of human drama spread across the film with many be small but they represent what is great. If you are looking for character in Dunkirk you may be disappointed. Similar to films like Gravity, the characters are us. The only distictive individual is Mark Rylance as a veteran sailor taking his boat across the channel to get some of the boys home. He is going on a virtual suicide mission with a casual demeanour that is some kind of extraordinary. It is as if he has convinced himself that if he fears than he fails. He represents what is the movie's strongest theme; the power of ordinary people. The soldiers get home on the private vessels and fishing boats of ordinary Englanders who were willing to heed the call.The one weakness of the movie is the same as that of Nolans last two films, the sound mix is murky and the dialog often inaudible.",8,3,11,20 November 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Un-amazing re-remake,
","It's hard to judge the Amazing Spider Man without bias having seen Sam Raimi's versionYou can argue that the movie succeeds by the standards of the increasingly tiresome superhero genre. It's linear rather than muddled, with a distinctive start, middle and end, and plenty of action, but it's just too damn predictable. Andrew Garfield as Pater Parker doesn't compel me as much as Tobey Macguire did. HE does not have the hapless, sympathetic nerd factor of McGuire, nor does he have the fire in his eyes of a motivated warrior of justice. Rhys Ivans is well cast for a villain. He is an actor who, when at his best, is exceptional. Unfortunately he falls into the generic narrative of the brilliant scientist who becomes a CGI monster.Aside from Gwen Stacy, The Amazing Spiderman brings nothing new to the material. It's nothing but the kind of cash grab that makes millions of dollars, which will then be spent on yet another sequel, and then another and another.",5,0,3,29 May 2017
54," Has nothing to sell
","Despite all the music, dancing, flashy lights, and glitter, 54 wanders around blind deaf and dumb, making no progress and ends up amounting to nothing. What could be more frustrating than being asked to watch two hundred people party like it's 1999, and not getting a chance to be a part of it. The film is dull. It is set up a little like Boogie Nights (which itself was set up like Goodfellas) meaning of course that the story has a first person perspective, narration included with a blow by blow description of names places and faces, and 'what a good time it was' or something like that. Too bad the narrator is a piece of cardboard, as is everyone else in the movie. Neve Campbell is the only one who feels human in her performance, yet she is given practically no screen time. If director Mark Christopher had bothered to spend as much time on character as he did on useless details like figuring out what color each light source should be, 54 may have amounted to something. It doesn't. Disco may be dead, but not half as much as this is.",3,1,2,22 July 2010
The Lego Movie," Well conceived, poorly assembled plaything
","The story involves the search for an object that can stop the 'Kragle'; a dangerous weapon threatening all of lego-mankind.With its mechanical meta awareness, franchise jokes, and a daring third act that shatters (not just breaks) the fourth wall, there is no question that the Lego Movie is clever. The problem is that the self mockery is too heavy. That and a jumbled story line, visually incoherent action scenes, and shallow emotional content make for a mediocre movie.Our protagonist is a modern version of the construction worker character from Lego's first packages. He is as amusingly mundane as the movie tells us he is, but remains mundane in those few moments when he is supposed to amount to something more. He goes from being a spoof on the hapless hero to being just another version of one.The most memorable piece of the movie is the ear worm song 'Everything is Awesome' which is as cheesy as it is addicting. Other highlights are Liam Neeson's Good Cop/Bad Cop, and a happy go lucky unicorn with a demonic alter ego lurking just under the happy face. Lego Batman has enough moments to have made him easily worthy of his own movie (which he now has). We also have all the other DC and Marvel heroes who are there just so the makers can check their names off the list.The ending takes us out of Legoland and into the three dimensional world. Here we get the punchline, the revelation of what exactly the 'Kragle' is. They has a cute idea, but it comes with notes of forced sentiment that fall rather flat.By focusing to much on mocking the gimmick of the toy, as well all the franchise characters, the movie itself ends up feeling like a gimmick. There is no heart, soul or narrative shape, and the scattered laughs don't make it worth the time.",5,1,1,6 June 2017
Saw III," 2/3 not bad 1/3 rubbish
","The makers of Saw III construct the film the way a preschool child makes a block tower. For the first hour Saw III is not only more freaky than Saw but it is one of the freakiest of slasher films. With each new block placed on top of another, the scenario gets more extreme, until one block too many causes the whole thing to collapse. The last twenty to thirty minutes of the film are a clumsy error of epic proportions. It is hard to say whether the makers were looking for away to bring an end to the Saw series or a way to continue it. All I can tell you is that what starts of pretty good turns into the kind of thing that makes you loose complete faith in James Wan, just another young mind who had a brilliant Idea which he took too far and is now six movies. Jigsaw is dying. and his apprentice kidnaps a young nurse, straps an explosive device around her neck, which will go off the minute Jigsaw's heart rate stops. That doesn't give her a lot of time to save his life. Meanwhile on the other side of his layer, Jigsaw's next victim is about to play the game. The one advantage that Saw II had over Saw what that we got to meet Jigsaw himself, not the puppet. Jobin Bell did his best to bring a large dose of Hannibal Lector to the role, something which he was not able to do twice. In Saw III, he is no more than a piece of rotting flesh spewing badly scripted lines. I blame the script writers more than Bell for the lousy characterization of Jigsaw in this movie.The climactic twist is the most frustrating part of the film, because not only do you see it coming, but it wrecks the movie. Had the filmmakers thought things through a little better, Saw III may have been good enough to make the idea of Saw IV sound promising. For once I'd like to see a horror franchise in which each entry is just as inventive as the previous.",5,1,2,2 December 2009
No Strings Attached," Not even close
","I should probably have seen it coming. Considering that neither Natalie Portman nor Ashton Kutcher have done anything remotely funny, and Ivan Reitman hasn't directed anything great since Kindergarden Cop, I wonder what it is that gave me hope that No Strings Attached could be any good. It's a bland experience, with bad acting, too much contrivance for comfort, and questionable focus. The vast bulk of the jokes fall flat, and the few that don't aren't very original.Even from the get go, you have the feeling that this movie is doing something wrong. In the first few minutes it jumps from ten years, to five years to the present day, and asks us to accept the fact that two people who met at a party and haven't spoken since would remember each other after several years. It's hard to say whether laughter was the intended reaction, but it feels far more awkward to the viewers than it does to the characters. It might have helped if anyone in the cast was trying, but nobody is. Ashton Kutcher, is potentially forgivable when considering that the role is way beyond him, but Natalie Portman, is not so easy to forgive. Her performance reeks of personality swings between girlish and womanish, she fails to sell emotion, and also she plays drunk like she's had no acting experience. Kevin Kline and Ludicrous are painfully underused in their supporting roles. This brings me to another problem with No Strings attached; too much of the plotting feels unnecessary. I would have liked it if the move spend more time with the lead couple. Instead, we have to ensure a time passing montage of sexual encounters, which rob us of the comedy and the credibility. Whatever it is that may sound appealing about No Strings attached is probably misleading. It's far too lazy and incompetent to be worth anyone's time.",5,11,25,22 January 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fiery show, a bit thin in plot, but enjoyable nonetheless
","The sheer exuberance of Scott Pilgrim Vs the World takes about twenty minutes to get used to, but afterward, it's fun....not quite great, but fun (no question)This is a motion picture that relies almost entirely on the integrity of the post-production departments (Editing, sound, special FX). With all the fast cuts, split-screens, animated sound waves/valentines/lighting fight captions in a dozen fonts, and more Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a feast for the eyes and ears. It expresses a love for Music, Video Games and comic books alike. It is a spectacle that almost overwhelms story, which one could argue is the films Achilles heel. The plot line is a bit too satirical for it's own good. Most of it is played for laughs but when it does try to be serious, it feels like a derivative, half-fleshed teen romance (guy gets girl, looses girl, gets her back)Being Toronto-born and bred, I had the pleasure of witnessing the crew shoot on four separate occasions. Not many movies are set in Toronto, but Scott Pilgrim is proud to do so, and is even written into the script. I wont argue that the movie sells the city in its full beauty, but it is funny to see a hundred million dollar motion picture working out of the library when you went as a kid. times change fast, but maybe not as fast as the rhythm of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. I'm not sure how the comic book lovers feel about the movie. I liked for what it is. Can't say I loved it but it is fresh and riveting.",7,4,13,11 November 2010
No Country for Old Men," Best film of the Decade
","As I sat in the theatre, about halfway through No Country for Old Men, I distinctly remember whispering to the person next to me this was Oscar gold. Little did I know that he was asleep. If nothing else, it just goes to show how peoples tastes vary, but I cannot imagine how anyone could fall asleep. This is a film that gets you hooked from scene one, and right until the ending, it is steeped in suspense, black humour, great direction and acting and it ain't afraid to get its hands dirty.Based on Cormack McCarthy's novel, No Country for Old Men dictates one simple truth. There is evil in the world, there always has been and there always will be. The previous generation of crime fighters including Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) are no match for a new generation of criminals, at the start of a new decade (the eighties). One such criminal is Anton Chigurth, who kills people with a pneumatic air gun. This strange fella is going after two million dollars in drug money which has been stolen by Llewelyn Moss. He is an ordinary Texan who just happens to stumble upon the after math of a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert. He finds the money, and tries to figure out how to get him and his wife clear and safe. Meanwhile, the Mexican drug dealers, The Law, and Chigurth are all coming after him.It is all the little details in the film which are what contribute to its high quality. I'll give you a great example. No Country for Old Men, is sucked almost completely dry of music. In one or two scenes, there is a very soft synthesizer drone, but the silence is far more potent. Alfred Hitchcock with the Birds was the last time I saw a music-free feature film.No Country for Old Men is not for the soft of heart, or the squeamish, but it will be embraced by anyone and everyone who can appreciate great cinema. Though unfortunately it is not a very popular movie (or at least it wasn't when it came out), I have a feeling No Country for Old Men will age well.",10,6,10,15 May 2010
Liar Liar," Ironic, amusing, and kind of touching. Among Carrey's best
","There are two facts which Liar Liar stresses clearly. One is optimistic and the other is rather pessimistic. In truth, most of us probably tell far more lies than we tell truths to people because it keeps us from getting slapped in the face among other things. It also points out that the most that in a capitalist society, where the family unit is never as communally linked as in other parts of the world, the most important thing to a boy (once he passes the age of Oedipus complex) is being with his father. With this in mind, Liar Liar is one of Jim Carrey's more emotionally intelligent comedies. Carrey is Flecher Reede, a sly/sharp criminal lawyer. His success comes from the fact that he is full of lies. He is away from home a lot. On the day of his son's birthday, he makes a couple of promises that he doesn't keep because he gets a good offer that evening. He misses the party. For the kid's birthday wish, he wishes that his father could only tell the truth for a day. It is going to be a very hectic day for Flecher, hopefully he can pull of the latest case he has been assigned to but can he also convince his ex wife not to leave with his son for Boston? She has a new boyfriend who has proposed to her.In the tradition of Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton, Jim Carrey is the best slapstick comedian today (or he was a few years ago). He is never dull here. Although I cannot recall a time when Carrey has made me scream with laughter, this I think is one of his best performances. Unlike with the Mask, this is Carrey doing the work, not the special effect department. I doubt if I need to describe what he is capable of, Most of us know, but for those who don't this might be the best film to introduce Jim Carrey to you. Either this or Ace Ventura...and that's no lie.",7,1,1,31 October 2009
Blue Crush," Surfs up? I don't think so
","Some sports movies are about sports (Remember the Titans) some are about the people who play them (Girl Fight). Blue Crush makes a huge mistake of choosing the latter approach, and it asks the viewer to invest in a handful of characters who are largely under fleshed, and never amount to much more than bodies in bikini's or shorts. The story is choppy and lacks fluidity, resulting in rushed characterization, a lack of explanation, and worst of all, The movie is not very exiting.Blue Crush's sole effectiveness, is that director John Stockwell has designed some phenomenal shots. He is able to work the camera behind the waves, below them or up atop them, sometimes onto the surfboard itself. Blue Crush may have some effectiveness as a sea spectacle but it is a superficial one. It's a flimsy story about flimsy people, frequently predictable. Offering a few laughs and few smiles, in an otherwise bland motion picture.",5,0,2,30 October 2010
Insidious," The stuff that nightmares are made of
","Insidious is a movie where a light goes on but the room still feels dark, where you are too afraid to look but you are forced to anyways, and where things go bump as they always do, but you don't see it coming. Such are the makings of a successful horror film which this is. The photography alone would impress Hitchcock, and even though the material is familiar to the genre, Director James Wan makes it feel juicy and fresh. Wan enjoys the stuff that nightmares are make of, as he has demonstrated here for the third time, following Saw and the arguably underrated Dead Silence. As accomplished and frightening as Insidious is, it's not perfect.Two problems come to mind. First of all, Patrick Wilson's lack of range for a lead role is unacceptable, especially next to Rose Byrne. Secondly, Wan's ambitious starts to take him into curious territory for the climax. Insidous goes from being Sixth Sense to being In the Mouth of Madness. Wan flirts a little too closely to the surrealist category, and while the film maintains perfect coherency, and is certainly no less scary, It gets a little hard to take seriously as Insidious comes to a close.Even so, the film does what it sets out to do. It's memorable and stands out, earning it's place as the horror film of the year. I hope James Wan can keep up the good stuff.",7,0,1,5 July 2011
The Number 23," Kinda neat, kinda dumb, very sinister but not bad
","I can't say that either Jim Carrey or Joel Schumacher have done anything impressive lately, but they do an okay job here. The number 23 is strangely entertaining. With its moody tone, its claustrophobic and haunting photography, its convoluted storytelling, and a lot of walls defaced with black ink, the movie frequently resembles John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness. This one is not quite as creative, and even though it occasionally gets clumsy, the film is fairly intriguing and might be worth checking out if you like scary thrillers.Jim Carrey is Walter Sparrow, a mild mannered dog catcher who has a nice family and a dull life. On Chrismas week, his wife buys him a strange memoir entitled 'The number 23'. Sparrow is a little sceptic at first, but once he starts to read he quickly gains interest, and is surprised to discover that the story has remarkable resemblance to his own life. One aspect in particular has gotten his attention. Sparrow starts to notice the number 23 itself appear everywhere, in dates, names, times... It gets him quite excited. Soon however, this hysteria will take him down a dark road as he seeks to find out the truth about what is really going on. What does the number mean? who wrote the novel? and what does it have to do with him?The funny thing about the movie, is that the whole 23 concept ends up being kind of eluding and irrelevant. It feels like little more than a plot element to throw the viewer off track so we cannot figure out the movie before it is ready to give us the climactic twist. Depending on how focused you are on the picture, it may or may not work. The ending is strangely predicable in a way, although not too blatantly.I can't say much for the acting (esspecially Carrey) but the cinematography and music are quite eccentric. There are times when the Number 23 feels like a cross between a Jazzy scored film-noir and a comic book.I guess in the end, the movie could use a little work, but of course nothing is perfect. Try it and see what it does for you. It's not 2 bad3 .",7,4,6,30 August 2009
Schindler's List," My favourite movie
","Oskar Schindler was a German Entrepreneur who came to Poland during the Nazi occupation to start a new business. He wanted to hire Jewish labor because they were cheaper than Polish. For a while, a good number of Jews went to work in Schinder's factories, making pots and pans for the German economy. Eventually they were rounded up by Nazi Comander Amon Goeth and put in the concentration camps. Those who were not fit to do back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. Oscar Schinder, who was in fact a Nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after watching the cruelty to these harmless people. Using all the money he made from the business, he purchased 1,100 Jews from the Nazis, and put them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war was over. Not long after the war ended, Amon Goeth was executed for his crimes against humanity, and Schindler unfortunately never ran a successful business again, but today the descendants of the Jews he saved number, tens of thousands.He has become a fairly controversial figure, but I personally think that Oskar Schindler was great hero of the 20th Century, and this is one of the greatest American films of all time; absolutely heartbreaking, cinematically epic, and flawlessly acted. Many thanks to both Schindler and Spielberg.",10,28,47,15 May 2010
The Mist," Rubbish, Rubbish, Rubbish
","I'd like to put full blame on Frank Darabont for the rubbish I saw, but equal blame should go to Stephen King. This is the dumbest story I think he's ever created. Sci-fi is not his cup of tea. After I saw Dreamcatcher, I thought that was bad. The Mist makes it look award worthy. This film is to horror/sci-fi what the Stone Temple Pilots were to grunge music. The story pilfers from so many of its predecessors, including the Mummy, Dawn/Night of the living Dead, Aliens, you name it. Praise for this film is misleading. If it is fun you are looking for, stay away from the Mist.Like all King stories, this one is set in a town in Maine. It begins in the living room of David Drayton a painter of movie artwork. It is a dark and stormy night, stormy enough to uproot a tree which crashes through the window. The next morning, after he and his wife inspect the damage and decide what to do, David goes grocery shopping at the local supermarket, taking his son with him. As it turns out, everybody at there is talking about the storm, and the damage it has done. But that is only a wrist slap compared to the disaster which is about to follow. All of a sudden, a strange mist engulfs the mall, and in runs a local with blood on his clothes. Shaken and panicking, he claims that there is something in the mist, and it has killed someone. The doors are shut and locked in a futile attempt to keep the unknown out. What follows is a boring series of creature attacks causing everyone to skriek, panic, argue, and point fingers at each other. David (eager to get his son to safety) must find a solution, before it is too late.The whole movie is a gimmick: badly written, badly acted, unscary, and even incompetent with visual effects. Actually, the biggest problem I have with the Mist can be summarized in one word...subversive. The Mist has anti-religious/government themes which are perfectly fine, but the film takes it too far over the top, which interferes with good story telling. Representing religion is Marcia-Gay Harden, whose performance is the worst of the year. Thomas Jane in the lead role isn't so good either. Jane is the wrong actor for an emotional character like a struggling father. He works better as your basic all American hero, which he was in Deep Blue Sea.It is kind of hard to figure out why people praise this movie. What I saw was disappointing and is not something I recommend to fans.",3,3,8,12 September 2009
Unknown," Enjoyable thriller
","Dr. Martin Harris is in Berlin with his wife attending a biochemistry conference. Unfortunately Dr. Martin gets into a little car accident and goes over a bridge. Four days later he wakes up from a coma, and when he attempts to get back to his life, he discovers two things; a) someone has stolen his identity, along with his wife and b) someone in town wants him dead.Even with a plot that feels progressively routine as the film plays out, Unknown deserves credit as a thriller that thrills. It's not a deep film, but it's not necessarily a shallow one either. It never feels too quick or too slow, and while it does a few very silly things, it maintains coherency and focus.Liam Neeson, though very much a coming of age actor, feels quite at home in Unknown. This is the kind of lead role that is usually better suited to younger actors, But Neeson hits all the right notes and shows no lack of energy, (although I suppose he is a little slow to get started).Director Jaume Collet Serra is young in his career, but he handles Unknown with a sense of experience. This is demonstrated in the way something like a car chase through the streets of Berlin at night can maintain visual coherency and avoid an unnecessary sense of spectacle.As a thriller, it should not be surprising for anyone going into Unknown that the story comes with a big climactic twist. And while it is quite absurd to be sure, it does (in an ironic way) make a couple other bits of the film seem a little less absurd. If I were to elaborate I might spoil something.Unknown may have been a Winter release, but that doesn't make it unworthy of investment. Flawed though it can be, I'd say it's recommendable to those who indulge in the genre.",7,0,1,18 June 2011
Coyote Ugly," Showgirls with clothes on, kinky perhaps but rushed and derivative.
","A shy Jersey girl hits New York hoping to be an aspiring song writer and she ends up working at a sleazy joint doing dances on the bar with her fellow 'coyotes'. Why is this happening? What kind of moron would use such a contorted device to advance a story? Unfortunately, Coyote Ugly doesn't not want to be a descent music movie, it wants to be Showgirls; a bad decision. I'll give points to the choreographer for staging a bar dancing style that doesn't rely so much on nudity to sell (unlike Showgirls), however that fact that the movie spends more time on such sequences than it does on anything else, results in Coyote Ugly being pretty Indescent. On the other hand, Coyote Ugly, is a much nicer film than Showgirls. There are fewer A**holes in the cast of characters, and far more laughs (although some may be unintentional)None of this however changes the fact that the storyline is tripe. Of course the intended audience won't care, but even if one treats the film as pure eye candy, its effectiveness doesn't go beyond moderate. Coyote Ugly feels wacky and rushed, and it's over before you know it. Ignoring the indecency, I don't feel there's quite enough here to warrant a look.",6,0,1,30 April 2011
Gran Torino," Eastwood at his best
","Beneath all the nastiness of this heavy drama, there is a surprisingly compelling level of emotion. It is a story about the rejuvenation of one man's mind which gets him to care for something to such extent that he is willing to die for it. Clint Eastwood is a miracle of Hollywood. Fifty years in film and he continues to shine through, no matter what role it is, acting, producing, directing and even composing. All the years of experience have payed off, especially here. I've never seen him act better, than in Gran Torino.Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, a retired Korean war veteran. He is a widower, a grump, and a racist. His anger reaches extremities one night when his young, Hmong (southeast Asian) neighbor Theo attempts to steal his 1972 Gran Torino. In an act of atonement, Theo offers to work for the old man. Walt is unwilling at first, but eventually takes the kid on as an apprentice. Walt suddenly finds that he is closer to this kid than his own family, and is even willing to risk his life when he decides to take action against Thao's ruffian bully cousin and his gang.Most have said that Gran Torino is good but not great, probably because the racist themes are overdone. I disagree. This is how Eastwood keeps you engaged, and if you are not bothered by bad language and mean- spirited behavior, than you will not be disappointed in the least. Eastwood is working harder now than he ever was in his career. His performance in this is so strong that I am convinced he will act again.",8,1,5,17 June 2009
The Hurt Locker," Intelligent, but awkward and emotionally dead
","With its choppy story telling, hand-held camera work, and low production values, The Hurt Locker resembles the style of last years Oscar nominee, The Wrestler, but emotionally, there is no comparison. This film is a dud. It is a tricky war story to be sympathetic with, because it never hits you in a visceral way. Certain scenes rise to a fair level of tension and potency, but like the result of a bomb explosion, The Hurt Locker is very much in pieces.We follow a trio of bomb disposal specialists in a small Iraq town during the war. When the movie begins, they have thirty days left in their tour. A premise as simple as this is good for being realistic and subjective. It allows the film to zoom in close with the subject. (often quite literally). Simplicity is a good thing, but the hurt locker gets a little clumsy. It starts off strong and it maintains a gritty realism, but it never comes alive. When the film is over you realize that it hasn't really taken you anywhere.",6,3,7,2 April 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Sparrow and Spectacle in another unneeded (but not unwatchable) sequel
","Kudos to Pirates 5 for showing us a younger Jack Sparrow, for bringing back Will Turner, for adding some fresh young blood, and for Captain Salazar's (Bardem's) sizzling screen presence. As for Jack Sparrow, the franchise has left him behind. Sparrow is a puppet meant to be laughed at as the plot whirls him through various comedic scenario's (including a forced marriage at gun point). Sparrow is no longer a catalyst of the tale, he is a victim in it. As you watch, you get the hunch that Depp is so discontent with the franchise that he is deliberate trying to sabotage it though his performance. He is not even even speaking his lines, he is garbling them.And yet somehow the movie still gets by. If nothing else, it is an improvement over the inert and imagination-free Pirates 4. The set pieces are far more spectacular but still they are far from compelling. When it comes to the 'circus' aspects of the film, directors Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg are good with the set up but not the punchline. Frantic editing, and poor lighting render most of the action scenes disoritnenting. The first and final scenes of the movie are the strongest. They are centred around Will Turner's son who seeks to break his father from the curse of the Dutchman. This is the starting point for the film muddled plot which has a beginning and an end, but no middle. The character of Henry Turner, and his 'girl to be' Carina, bring a hint of something that was missing in the last film; a sense of character purpose. He seeks to free his father, and she to find the map in the stars from a clue that her father left behind. If only the film has given them a little more time. Other highlights of the film include a flashback to the origins of Sparrows rivalry with Salazar's Barbossa's brimming new beard / hairstyle combo, as well as a cute cameo by an almost unrecognizable Paul McCartney.And then the film ends on the kind of note that is perfect, and very much needed, The kind that brings resolution to it's characters and does not cry out for another sequel.",6,0,0,9 November 2017
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Beautiful people, big box office, zero story
","Okay here it is, New Moon is not unwatchable (thought some parts come close). Twilight was a bit better mostly cause it had some direction. This one is severely unfocused, with a plot that denies motivation and has lazy acting across the board...well not quite.New Moon may have one edge over its predecessor which is that Taylor Launter puts more into the game than Rob Pattinson. At times, it feels like Jacob may be the better match for Bella. Their interaction which takes up the majority of the movie in fact, feels less broody than the Bella/Edward connection. Unfotunately, around the beginning of the third act we grow out of Jacob almost as fast as we grow into him. Wheras Edward is quite blatantly shy, Jacob by contrast is angry. The reasons for this however seem largely unjustified by the story. Like all bad stories, this one advances by making up its own rules on the spot, resulting in a movie that makes very little sense.I'm truly not sure what it is about the Twilight saga that demands such a plastic style of acting. Why is everyone so lazy about this? it actually degrades the quality of the material. If this is the kind of Romantic chemistry that sells on the market (a chemistry where two people act like kissing is more pain than pleasure) then Romance itself could be a dying genre.But perhaps that is an overstatement. New Moon gave me something to watch on TV when there was nothing else on, I wouldn't recommend it for any other purpose.",6,6,7,23 April 2011
Transformers," The beginning of an expensive bombastic gimmick
","Ten years ago, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay kick started what would eventually become one of the most financially successful and bombastically dumb summer franchises in film history. So putting aside any thoughts or premonitions about the function of this fiasco, it's worth looking back and asking how the original Transformers bodes as movie.In the first hour, Bay succeeds in summoning some laughs out of Shia LaBoeff and his new car (the autobot Bumble-Bee in disguise). Keeping this a secret from his parents makes the hiding of ET look like a piece of cake. Enter Megan Fox, the potential love interest. When we meet her, she is inspecting a car engine, bent over it as if posing for a playboy cover. She goes through the movie with almost as little to do as she has to say; a reminder that the women in Michael Bay movies are objects. Bay's floating swirling camera work signifies everything that is simultaneously right and wrong about him; he is a exceptional pornographer. The focal point of his direction has always been making the shot look good. In terms of performance there is nothing wrong with the camera work, but ironically its perfection is distracting; as is the application of slow motion. LaBeoff has enough energy and tongue-in-cheek to make the first hour of the movie tolerable. Halfway in we meet Optimus Prime in all his chrome bodied glory, with the sombre godly voice of Peter Cullen. He gives a cue card explanation of his job and his enemy the Cybertrons. These moments may conger feeling of nostalgia for anyone who grew up on the 80's series. For the rest of us, Optimus' lecture makes you realize how cheesy an idea Transformers really is.Bay stages a loud numbing climax that is the film's greatest undoing. It starts with a punch that catapults an eighteen wheeler so beautifully that it would have been more thrilling to have seen the actually rigged effect on set. he may have a good eye for camera, but when it comes to editing he is virtually blind. The action takes place in the kind of dense metropolis where all the buildings are the same colour, and there is no sense of orientation. It feels as if every shot is only two frames in length, and at the speed of the unfolding chaos makes it impossible to distinguish the Autobots from the cybertrons. Perhaps more than anything else, Transformers' biggest problem is that is that the Transfomers themselves are nothing resembling characters. They have no feelings, and their dialog seems manufactured. Certain lines are exactly what you expect to hear when you press the button on the toy.",5,1,2,10 July 2017
Event Horizon," Short, Silly, Superficial but watchable
","Event Horizon is an awkward sci-fi flick. The only thing it really succeeds in doing in being grizzly and ominous (not to mention gory). Over the course of an hour and a half, we are not given much more than a handful of shocks. However, the filmmakers somehow manage to execute this messy story well enough that if you like this sort of thing, you may not be temped to walk away.After being lost in space for seven years, the Event Horizon spacecraft has suddenly reappeared in the solar system in the year 2047. A small crew led by Captain Miller is sent out to explore the ship and get some answers. What they slowly begin to realize is that the ship has not merely gone off the edge of the map, but it has been to hell and back, and now there are supernatural forces aboard. The reasons how and why this has happened are not explained to us, which is kind of disappointing. What follows is a story of survival on the haunted ship with lots of gore, cheap dialog, and typical cardboard acting.Event Horizon is not the worst sci-fi film out. I would definitely recommend it over films like 'Sphere' and/or 'The Fifth Element', but regardless, the movie still needs work. It is just barely entertaining.",6,1,3,7 May 2009
Mulholland Drive," Didn't work for me at all.
","Despite more than a little praise from the masses, and a general consensus which names this as Lynch's best (if not Blue Velvet), I have no problem with being cynical of Mullholland Dr. To call it bad would be an overstatement, but more than anything else, this motion picture is aggravating. It suffers a major case of over writing and direction. The scenario is utterly hammy, unbelievable, and badly acted with Lynch trying too hard to force his motifs on us that it gets annoying. Mullholland Dr. is very mean spirited towards Hollywood. Part of the movie feels like an attempt to flip off the concept of big studios and executives being nasty and indecent towards everyone. The other part of the film is pure surrealism. The whole thing doesn't come together well enough.Outside of Lynch Fan's, Mullholland drive 'may' be of interest to some others. Anybody who embraces films like David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch or John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness (with their out of this world storytelling that crosses into fantasy) may get a kick out of Mullhollond Dr. The film is artistic, no denying that, but unfortunately the end result proves to be pretty unlikeable.",Null,3,5,18 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Better, but honestly....what's the point?
","A significant step up from the mail-in that was The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi (for a start) does not feel the urge to jump into lightspeed with back-to-back action sequences that are as predicable as they were visually incomprehensible.In the Last Jedi, introspective comes before candy. that seems to be the attitude, of the movie, but Rian Johnson's script is not quite up to the task. the problem is, that the film has inhered the duty of answering the questions of what has become of Luke Skywalker, and Johnson doesn't really seem to give a damn.Instead of Mark Hamil embedding Skywalker, the character embodies the actor; a grumpy crone, who has given up on his career, and more intent to go out with a whimper than a bang ....some hero. For a series that was always contrived as escapism with a few lessons in reality, this failed characterized leans a little too close to reality. Almost two decades into the 21st century, there are lots of boomers like Skywalker with a poor attitude.Rey seems to be coming into her own as a character. The most interesting scenes in the movie are the telepathic conversations between her and Kai Lo Ten, who by the the end of the movie steals it. Somehow she can sense the good or 'conflict' in him, and attempts to give him the same routine that Luke gave his father in the climax of episode xi. Her charisma is beginning to blossom, which is remarkable considering she has little emotional motivation of her own. As Ren points out at one later, 'you have no place in this story'. The extension of that line which probably got edited out is; 'you are here simply to pander to a contemporary gen y audience.'the rest of the cast, (which is where the action happens) is an unfortunate afterthought. A potential love interest emerges for Finn, and the two of them endure events that amount to a wasted subplot, including a 'horseback' chase scene through a Riviera style casino that is very cartoony. that whole scene feels like an opportunity for the developers of the next lego video game.The best thing the the movie has going for it, is that it never feels like it's in a hurry to get to the punchline. It makes you want to listen, but you may not be satisfied with what you hear.",Null,3,5,24 April 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Galactic circus of cheap thrills
","Guardians of the Galaxy feels like a Roger Corman space opera on steroids.Fortunately the movie acknowledges its absurdity, so the makers flavour this adrenaline shake with plenty of humour. The laughs are the best part of this Marvel circus. Otherwise, the experience is surprisingly numbing. It is over saturated in noise, colourful effects and action, and underwhelming in character, and intimate scenes.Michael Rooker's face is a major distraction. He looks like an understudy for the Blue Man Group show. Unfortunaelty he chooses not to play for laughs, so his dead pan presence is curiously awkward.The climax involves major aerial fire fights which demonstrate the problems that I have with 21st century CGI; There is too much to see and nothing to focus on.Ignoring the humour that make certain scenes worthwhile, Guardians of the Galaxy is unremarkable; another superhero spectacle that thinks we all have ADD.",5,1,2,1 June 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," exceptional style, memorable but not perfect
","What is the recipe for Quentin Tarantino. A little Spagetti Western, a little Akira Kurosawa, a bit of mixed media, and an artistic/humorous take on the spilling of blood and bodily fluids. Works great in Kill Bill, a film with exception style, worthy of praise even if it is occasionally slow.Another thing memorable about Quentin Tarantino, is the manner in which he has found a loophole through the rules of conventional storytelling and narration. I am referring of course to the way he gives his film chapters, allowing him to jump from here to there without ruining the story, always something new. The smartest thing about Kill Bill, is how you know absolutely nothing when the film starts, and even when it ends, there are many questions posed (intentional of course). With each chapter something new is revealed. This is how he keeps you going, in order to get answers one must sit through and endure his tedium, black sense of humour, and you won't get any answers if you walk out.Kill Bill is essentially the ultimate revenge story, a modern Count of Monte Cristo. Uma Thurman, wakes up from deaths doorstep, and she is eager to go after the five people who almost killed her on her wedding day. Bill is #1.Of course the reason Kill Bill is in two parts, is because, Tarantino is slow. He throws in pauses and segments of silence where no other filmmaker since Kurosawa (or Sergio Leone) has. This is one of the reason he is so controversial. Much of the movie is a build-up, but the payoff is sufficient, Kill Bill vol 1. has a killer climax, and an equally big cliffhanger ending.If you can stomach Tarantino, I guarantee, Kill Bill Vol 1 will make you eager for more.",Null,1,2,14 April 2010
Saw II," Not terrible but not needed either.
","If I have to make one statement about the nature of the on-going horror (and specifically) the slasher trend it would be this; No good formula works twice.This is the simplest reason why Saw II is an inferior sequel as so many films are. James Wan had a clever idea for his debut picture, it was well thought out, nicely paced, and offers a really scary twist ending which was totally unpredictable. Saw II presents a different string of characters and bloody chapters, but at its centre, this is pretty much the same thing, only less effective. The story is far more shallow, and moves too quickly. The acting is weak, the plot twists are predicable, not to mention the the ending which is totally plagerized from the Saw script. What is frustrating is that it offers a cliff hanger for what is probably an even worse sequel. The Saw franchise is the latest domino effect with each film's ending giving way to a new beginning. They are now up to #6. By the time they decide to stop the franchise there will be so many Saws that the public is liable to forget the brilliance of where the idea began. Jigsaw plays a more ambitious game this time. He has locked a bunch of people in a house. The instructional cassette informs them thay they have (without knowing) inhaled a lethal gas which will take affect in two hours. In the room is a safe, and inside is the antidote. They have two hours to find the numbers to the code which are located somewhere within his booby trapped house. The youngest of these captives is Daniel Matthews, and his father Eric is a locally renowned police detective. He and his team have miraculously arrested jigsaw, but can detective Matthews get him to reveal the whereabout of his son before time runs out?I like the way Saw II is photographed. Each location uses a different filter to change the color scheme. The house is tinted golden making it look kind of retro or antique. Jigsaw's headquarters are tinted green, which is a very sickly color, and one of the last scene takes us back to the cellar bathroom from Saw. The colour is tinted Blue/and white, which are very cold colours.I guess the only reason I am not appalled by Saw II is the fact that I was expecting it to be less impressive than Saw (which it is). Saw truly is a story fit for one film, not 2 (let alone 6 or more)",6,0,0,16 September 2009
From Dusk Till Dawn," Among the best of its kind
","When I hear the words campy horror, a specific handful of names come to mind. One of them is Rodriguez and Tarantino's From Dusk Till Dawn. Thought it is extremely Silly, Gory and so far into the red zone that it is at times just shy of black, the film not only delivers the goods, but it delivers them which a descent sense of black humour, a sensational make up effects job, and a cast of characters that you actually end up kind of liking more than one usually does with these movies (well some of them arn't so likable). Once you watch it, you'll know what I mean. If this is your thing and you haven't seen this flick yet, you really and truly should.It is a 'hot God damn day' in Big Springs, Texas when the movie starts, Seth and Richard Gecko, are the most notorious bandits in the state and are responsible for the deaths of a good twenty people (both cops and civilians) After blowing up a liqueur store in scene one, they know they have to get over the border before the FBI get them (the Mexican border that is, not the Canadian). The Gecko Bros highjack a retired priest and his family who have a big RV, and devise a plan to get across. After they do, the gang heads for a bar with the degrading name 'Titty Twister'. It is inconveniently in the middle of nowhere. There they plan to have a night of drinking and parting, but all is not as it seems. All the staff and dancers turn out to be vampires, and in a few moments of extreme gore they kill everyone but our heroes and a couple of bikers. Can our gang survive the remainder of the night, fighting back with what little means they have?I did a lot of research on the movie before I saw it. All sources say that this is the goriest film in modern cinema. In a way it is, but Robert Rodriguez has a couple of tricks up his sleeve. He makes the gore look intentionally unrealistic (ex. Green blood, lots of goo) because if it looked to convincing, the MPAA might give the film an NC-17 rating or perhaps even ban it from theatres. Regardless, From Dusk Till Dawn is still pretty gross but it is not vomit provoking (unless of course this is your first movie).There are a lot of other things to say about From Dusk till Dawn, many of them good, but a few which are not so good. Regardless, it is not one to be missed. As Rodriguez says, it is a good film to get drunk on with friends at night, just don't make it a date movie.",Null,6,9,22 October 2009
Clash of the Titans," Shallow, Hokey, kind of fun (not quite enough though)
","The year is young, but Clash of the Titans qualifies as the hokey semi-epic of 2010, the same way Forbidden Kingdom was to 2007, or 10 000 b.c. was to 2008. From a lobotomized point of view, I suppose the action scenes make up for the total lack of story and the frustration generated by the pointless use of characters and bad acting. So I guess, the film is superior to the 1981 version, but it's got a long way to gothe story is a retelling of the Perseus myth, and the screenplay does it no justice. It feels rushed and cheesy, with not a moment of time spent on intelligent dialogue. Director Louis Leterier likes to stage his fights in martial arts cinema tradition, and although he takes it a bit over-the-top with too many slow-mo shots, I suppose it's fun stuff. Of course, it has nothing on his last movie, The Incredible HuIk. Also, would've liked to see a little more from the climax, which is far too short, and presents a pretty big plot hole (which for obvious reasons I wont describe)The geology of the movie is fascinating, but half of it is not Greek. (I know I've been to Greece). It's pretty easy to recognize the volcanic ash fields of Argentina, used in numerous movies before, or the lush green wet forests from the Pacific coast. Not like any of this is a real problem. I also like the make-up jobs on peoples faces, although to be honest Ralph Finnes and Liam Neeson look more Viking than Greek, and ironically Zeus's beard 'clashes' with the color of his armour. Sam Worthington is hot stuff, but he cannot act. He's the new Jason Stathum. It's not like he has much to do or say though. Clash of the Titans is just another case of poor script = mediocre movie. The special effects do make a difference next to Ray Harryhausen, but the movies intention to honor him, is inept, and I think it could've delivered more.",6,3,6,2 April 2010
Jurassic World," Jurassic Turd
","All the bits and pieces that make up Jurassic world stink of dinosaur dung; it has plastic looking people, incompetent and rushed CGI, and silly dialogue hinging on equally silly concepts. The story kind of winks at its own over enfranchisement by depicting Jurrassic park as a failing enterprise that is doing everything it can to stay in business, including breeding new species of dinosaur. Jurassic Park in the cyberspace era includes pods, monorails and projections that are all more convincingly animated than the dinosaurs. It makes us yearn for the mechanical wizardry of Stan Winston.Fronting the Cast is Chris Pratt, who is dressed like an Indiana Jones sidekick and is training raptors to respond to commands. Some may find this interesting but I found it laughable. The relationship with his domestic dinos loosely resembles a director trying to get an unwilling Russell Crowe to cooperate. Dinosaurs are far more interesting when they are in the wild. Then there is a moment where a shark is fed to a giant Marine Reptile which breaches like a whale to snatch it off a wench in front of a full audience. This kind of material is just as boring because it is condescending of its subject matter. Steven Spielberg's Jurrasic Park was a Safari in a real environment. This one is just an amusement park.Every scene in the movie (save one or two) feels like it was pulled from the script of one of the previous three films. Michael Crichton is probably turning in his grave.",Null,3,6,29 May 2017
Paranormal Activity," Plot less but clever, and absolutely terrifying
","What does it take to make a scary movie. If you were to reply by saying that Suspense is the key, I would ask you to be more specific. It is not what you DO see in a movie that provokes fear but rather what you DO NOT see. With the possible exception of Jaws, I can think of no better example than Paranormal Activity to support the argument. Following in the footsteps of Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity is a story told not from any character's perspective, but rather from the viewers perspective. We are practically inside the camera, which is a great feeling to have, but an equally terrifying one. Though the film is not without fault it is definitely one of the scariest movies of the decade.Ever since she was eight and her house burnt down, Katie is convinced that she is being followed by unnatural forces. Fifteen years later, she and her boyfriend move into a new house in San Diego. The boyfriend sees this as a good opportunity to document the supernatural activity in the hopes that he can chase it away. He sets up a camera in the bedroom and leaves it running at night. In eighty minutes, Paranormal Activity, covers twenty nights in the haunted house (although we don't see all twenty of them) This is a film that grabs you by the throat and squeezes. It is not a fun scary movie, it is scary scary. Repetitious as the story it may be, the film is never dull. There is nothing cheap or superficial about the shocks in this movie, it felt very real and I was indeed scared",8,3,7,29 December 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," Kinda dumb, kinda clever, good progression, sloppy ending
","When life gets a little off course, the guys from the Adjustment Bureau step in to get it back on track, as they have been doing with humanity since the cradle of civilization. Sometimes it's luck, sometimes it's them, but you'll never know. The Adjustment Bureau is one of those movies which treats science fiction like a business; Explanation comes before imagination, and it has to map out its own set of rules. Call it a realist fantasy if you will, like Stranger than Fiction.The film is enjoyable in the moment but it's never a whole lot more enriching than than. The product feels kind of half baked, only somewhat romantic, only somewhat clever, only somewhat thrilling. Sometimes it actually come close to being funny in a self reflexive way.For a movie that is largely about fate vs. chance, I have no doubt that the film makers would have thought it ironic to use such an ending as the one we get, but it is ironic in the wrong way. The last ten minutes form an insulting deus ex machina/ cheap shot, the kind that makes you want to wonder if the film was rushed in the making. Indeed, the Adjustment Bureau ends up feeling way shorter than it should be. It's a nifty movie to be sure, and arguably a nice movie, but it needs adjustment.",6,2,4,8 March 2011
Big Fish," Unforgettable
","He is one of Hollywood's greatest visual artists, but until I saw this I wouldn't have said Tim Burton was much of a storyteller. Big Fish gives us the best of both worlds, story and visual splendour. The movie is not just one story, it gives us four or five. Although it is set up a little like Forrest Gump and occasionally bears resemblance to the Wizard of Oz, the film has a life of its own. Funny, touching, adventurous, and low on clichÃ©s, Big Fish is a tale of near perfect proportions.This is the story of Edward Bloom from Ashon, Alabama. A town hero, he befriended a fifteen foot giant, worked three years at a circus, won the heart of his dream girl, became a war hero in Korea, ran a successful interstate business, and saved a town from bankruptcy. Bloom was everything that a man could ask for. Except one thing, he was not an honest father. Since growing up, his son Will has hated his father's guts, because he has told him nothing but stories, and not one truth. It has been twenty years since they last spoke. Will is living in France with his wife, but one evening he receives a call from his mother asking him to come visit. His father is dying. This pretty much summarizes the intro. The rest of the movie cuts back and forth between the story of Ed Bloom's life and the present day, where Will is trying to re bond with his father in the remaining few days he has.Big Fish is a carnival of color shape and size, which is what you would expect from Burton, but here it is at its best. I'm surprised it didn't receive an Oscar nominating for set design. The movie acts as an ode to storytelling and imagination. Its intentions are noble, and its morals are universal. There is something for everybody in Big Fish.",Null,0,0,11 November 2009
Friends with Benefits," A sweet satire that's almost good (but not quite)
","What I can say for Friends with Benefits is that it's a cute movie that doesn't reach it's full potential. The main problem to me is that when it starts, the film is being played as satire and when it ends, it's being played straight. As a result, Friends with Benefits does not quite rise above the romantic material it mocks, but on occasion it's funny and adorable.Actually for a while, the movie is on fire. The opening is cleverly handled, and is a good way to grab the audiences attention. Then for the next several scenes, Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake demonstrate charm, comfort and overall competence and end up delivering a couple of the funniest sexual encounters I've seen in years. What I like about them both is that they bring enthusiasm to whatever they do, and this film is no exception.Around the halfway point, the film starts to feel a little boring. with a running time of just over a hundred minutes, Friends with Benefits is not a long movie, and while it's not exactly short either, it feels shorter than it should be. There are a few hints to suggest that a longer movie was intended but the Studio may have forced a cut down. In addition to an ending that feels rushed, all the supporting characters in the story seem futile, and underwritten. Woody Harrelsson, for example, can be a really funny guy, but he's not given the material or the screen time, to make his appearance worthwhile.The film has it's ups, it has it's downs. It doesn't end up being a bad Rom-com, but I've seen better.",6,79,117,22 July 2011
Into the Wild," An epic American adventure
","Of all the animals shown in this movie: The Kodiak Bear, the Grey Wolf, the Bald Eagle, the Moose etc, only one has the ability to make dreams.... that animal is man. From director Sean Penn, Into the Wild captures in detail one of the defining features of the human species; to be able to have a dream, and the desire to fulfill it. Despite a somewhat clunky two and a half hour running length (which may feel loger depending on how old you are) Into the Wild is an adventure that becomes one with the viewer. It is a demanding project but the work has paid off nicely, and I'll raise my glass to it for that.Into the Wild is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless. After graduating college as an A+ student in 1992, he chose to leave his materialist society and stuck up family behind. He chaged his name to Alex Supertramp, and embarked on a quest for Alaska. On his journey, he covered thousands of miles of American wilderness, on foot, by train, car, kayak, meeting a plethora of weird and wonderful people along the way.It is absolutely vital for the movie that the character of Chris/Alex is one whose company we can enjoy. After all, his journey is ours. Emile Hirsh's performance is definitely sufficient. He is a little wacky but in a good way. He is also talented, bold, determined, and fun to be around. I suppose it is also worth noting that he has a pretty face.A movie like Into the Wild is also demanding on the crew. After all, the storyline covers about half the country, which of course means lots of transportation is needed, and lots of landscape imagery. The camera is all over the place, referring of course to locations (not movement). Into the Wild is a gorgeously photographed picture, which is backed up with a great song score from Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. I remember a couple years ago during Oscar season being annoyed that his songs were snubbed, because of eligibility rules.My one problem with the movie, is that the editing feels a bit tripy. Into the Wild frequently plays with time in a Pulp Fiction manner, and some of that time concerns flashbacks related to family melodrama. These scenes are conveniently short but they don't seem important enough to be worth showing. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that the last half hour could use a few trims.No movie is perfect of course, and no human being is perfect either, it is not until the end of the film when we realize that about Chris. But I'll say this much, the journey was worth it, and if you can spare an hour and a half for Into the Wild, I think you will agree with me on that.",9,4,7,31 July 2010
Avatar," Cameron Returns
","Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. Jake Sully, is an ex-marine, bound to a wheel chair. He seeks to make a fresh start on the moon Pandora where his brother worked. The moon has a military run mining colony. The business has brought humans into contact with the local natives, tall blue dudes, called Na'vi. The Na'vi inhabit a part of the moon under which lies a large deposit of valuable minerals, and the humans are trying to get them to relocate. Colonel Quarich who runs the operation, ask Sully to go under cover as a Na'vi, to learn the secrets, to give the humans an advantage. If successful, Sully will get his legs back. The magic of future science and 3-D effects give Sully a handsome genetically engineered Avatar body, and he embarks on his mission. Once on the inside however, his loyalties to the humans start to turn when his heart gets lost to the Na'vi princess Neytiri. Is he willing to fight on the blue side now?The landscape of Pandora is the most creative and inventive of the decade. There are creatures that you might find in your wildest dreams or your worst nightmares. There is flora and fauna that shine with the bioluminescence of a thousand deep sea critters, and also trees which dwarf the Empire State Building.I guess the only noticeable problem with Avatar, is a lack of original story. What you see on the screen will blow you away, but all the tough critics, may come down a bit on the fact that despite being the latest in film technology, Cameron uses a very old archetypal formula, perhaps just a bit too schematic. There are a few badly scripted segments of dialogue, but nothing that makes you wanna blow raspberries at the screen.What is most important is the fact that Cameron's story gets the viewer involved and offers a handful of memorable and likable characters to root for, and some to root against. This is the post- modern era, and originality is rare, but if there is any technical progress to be made in the world of movies and entertainment, there is one name that dwarfs all JAMES CAMERON, and after ten years hiding from the Hollywood mainstream, he is back.",9,846,1353,12 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Raimi goes back to the man he used to be.
","Sam Raimi hasn't made a bad movie yet, and while Drag Me To Hell has emerged as a case of you hate it or you love it (like Apocalypse Now, Forrest Gump, and Avatar). It turns out to be a fun ride.Christine Brown is a loan officer in L.A. and is trying to get the position of assistant manager. She decides that in order to impress her boss, she has to be tougher. So when an old gypsy woman comes and asks her for a third extension on mortgage payment, Christine denies her that. Feeling shamed, the old woman puts a curse on Christine, and sends a demon after her. Her life is suddenly in ruins, but with the help of a fortune teller, and his Latin American friends, Christine attempts to rid herself of the demon, before it takes her down to hell. the ending of the film is more than somewhat controversial, and in fact you could even spend the rest of the day going over it in your mind, trying to figure out what the Raimi bros were thinking. In fact considering what they choose, the entire story is kind of pointlessly staged, but at least it is fun. Raimi takes us on a crazy ride, we the viewers are treated to a handful of shocking and humorous moments, many of which directly resemble, the Evil Dead flicks. You can tell from this that after fifteen years, Raimi is still a master at horror. He has tackled every genre but it is clear now that he is most at home with this genre. I would not say it's lovable, but it doesn't disappoint either.",7,21,38,29 May 2010
The Artist," good classic film making
","I was a little bit timid going in to The Artist, fearing that a PG rated hundred minute silent movie might be soapy and sentimental. I was very impressed to find that this is not the case. The Artist is a film about simple relationships, and that's its strength, simplicity. We begin in the year 1927. George Valentin; a charismatic silent movie star is very fond of the new member of his latest cast, Peppy Miller. She is very fond of him too, but they go separate ways with the arrival of talking pictures. George refuses to take part in such pictures, while Peppy embraces it and goes on to become a super star, leaving George in the shadows. But does this mean she has forgotten him?I think what keeps the movie from being cartoony is that The Artist could have easily been played as a romance, but it chooses not to. George and Peppy are presented as friends not lovers. The movies that are featured within the movie have all the soap and sentiment, but this one is played serious. It does have it's effective moments of comedy though. The best the Artist, even as a silent movie, never feels overdone.Most of the time, The Artist is actually a rather sad movie. A good portion of it is focused on George's low point in life, spent brooding, low on cash, and unable to make a successful film. The two leads carry the film, beautifully. Director Michael Hazanavicious trusts his actors completely. He chooses to let the camera linger on their faces rather than break up the scenes with to many caption cards. In fact there is more dialogue spoken and inaudible in the Artist than there is captioned dialogue. The plot is presented accessible to a fairly general audience while still being a maturity of subject matter; also quite impressive. The Artist is shot and assembled very well, and looks like something that was made eighty years ago. One item worth noting is of course how early movies have far more static frames than moving ones, as stedicams and shoulder camera-work would not be in vogue il the mid- late twentieth century. Even for a mostly static picture, there are some great shots and angles. I particularly enjoyed a dutch angle (diagonal) shot of George at a table which is so polished that you can't telling with is the man and which is the reflection until he spills his drink.The ending came a little bit more abruptly than I thought. for a film with such a long middle section I would've liked to an extra five to ten minutes. the hundred minutes that made up the Artist are a delightful throwback, with room for laughs and tears. It's a film with heart and soul, and even if imperfect is one of the most disticive films of the year.",7,7,13,9 December 2011
Saw," A surprisingly inventive idea well executed
","There is a serial killer out there. His name is Jigsaw, and he is possibly the most deadly and cunning primate descendant since Hannibal Lector. This is how he kills. He abducts his chosen victims, dumps them in the bowels of his lair, and he sets a trap upon them. This trap could be a cage full of stretched barbed wire, or it could be an explosive helmet strapped to one's head. After setting the trap, he starts the countdown, then sits back and watches his victims try to escape before time runs out and he leaves them to die. In trying to escape, the victims subsequently kill themselves in gruesome ways. Jigsaw there fore does not get a drop of blood on his hands. It is all a game, and horror fans will love it. Well, they already do. The film is engaging from the beginning, because there is no introduction to the story. The curtain rises on an event which has already begun. In a rusty old bathroom, two men Dr. Lawrence Gordon and Adam Faulker wake up to find them ankle chained to the piping. They have no idea where they are and why, but they soon figure out that they have been kidnapped. The body of a dead man has been dumped in the room, and in his hand is a cassette player on which to play the instructional cassette which their kidnapper has left them. The instructions are for Dr. Gordon. He has until 6:00 to kill Adam, or his wife and child will get it. Gordon must think fast to outsmart the killer who is watching them ready to spill Innocent blood. Someone recently asked me why these films appeal to so many. Even as a horror fan, I don't find slasher films appealing unless they offer something a step above the lobotomy level. Saw offers this and more. Is it disturbing? yes, but it has good energy and creativity. If you haven't seen it yet, you should. But brace yourself",8,0,1,15 September 2009
Sinister," Another ghost story that rises before it falls
","People going to see Sinister are most likely doing so because they are fans of the genre, and have likely seen dozens of such films. Sinister's greatest trick is that for a while, it convinces you that you have NOT seen this kind of movie before. It will have you hooked from the first shot, and for about an hour, Sinister is just as suspenseful as it is intriguing. Unfortunately, like so many movies do, the final act falls short.Sinister runs out of steam in the last half hour. The ending is a problem, for not only does it come with a sense of anti-climax, but it is almost absurd enough to pass for genre parody. It leaves behind an abundance of red herrings, and you come away feeling a little bit cheated.Another problem with Sinister is that it sweeps two or three potentially interesting sub-plots under the rug; something that would have given the movie more interesting characters. There is a sense that too much story material was left behind in order to make this a more direct and unfaltering ghost story.Perhaps more than any other genre, horror movies demand very manipulative interior cinematography, and Sinister doesn't seem like it was lit properly. Even for a horror movie, the shadows are surprising heavy and overwhelming, and there are moments when it is too dark to see anything. This is not a complaint I make frequently about movies. More impressive in Sinister, is the sound design. which is full of subtle contributions. I cannot remember the last time I was spooked by the sound of a film projector's motor and claw.I wish I could recommend Sinister, but I cannot. Even if it is a scary movie, it is one that initially appears to be smarter and more original than it actually is.",6,3,5,16 August 2013
Reservoir Dogs," Gritty, realistic, very good
","Reservoir Dogs is a very misanthropic picture, but very strong and convincing. Unlike Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, I do not believe for a moment that Tarantino took pleasure in the violence he was orchestrating for this picture, although I'm sure many would disagree. There is no wit, no jokes, no heroism or mannerism, What Tarantino gives us is very primal and visceral but remarkably real.The story follows the aftermath of a jewelry heist gone wrong. Five out of eight robbers (one who is badly wounded) hide out in a vacant warehouse and try to figure out what went wrong. They begin to suspect that one of them is a rat. Each character gets a flashback told from his point of view, showing how he became part of the operation. One has to respect Tarantino for the risks he is taking. Considering it is his first film as a director, one might think he would want to do something that attracts an audience rather than repulses them. Tarantino turns so many things on end, making Reservoir Dogs a very difficult film to watch, but it should not be dismissed as bad. It is an impressive movie, but not one for the light hearted. View only if you think you are ready.",8,0,0,21 July 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," despite the ending it qualifies as an achievement
","Considering his mise-en-scene, I like to think of Kubrick as a neo-expressionist. Eyes Wide Shut however embodies that and more. There is a dose of surrealism to this, in part because when all is said and done, the film makes no sense, which is frustrating because otherwise it would've been perfect. Like all Kubrick films, this one shows an exceptional knowledge of modern art. It is theatrical and haunting, sometimes a little too much so, which leads to a case of Overacting, also typical of Kubrick.The real problem with Eyes wide shut however is simply the last twenty minutes. Anti climactic, abrupt and does a terrible job of explaining what it attempts to, which results in the film ending on what seems like a random, almost lame note. Up till that point Eyes Wide Shut, is a near cinema sensation of modern film, and one that bookends the career of one of histories greatest auteurs.",8,0,0,7 March 2010
Beauty and the Beast," The whole package of everything we loved, except 'the love' itself
","The opening scenes of Beauty and the Beast are very hard to watch. This film is such an accurate blow by blow mimic of the 1991 Oscar winner that it even nails the timing between lines. Unfortunately this is a live movie with real actors, and actors need timing to give convincing performances. there is no timing here. The movie goes from one beat to another in spectacular fashion, and never catches its breath until halfway through the picture.The highlight is the art direction. Beauty and the beast takes the gilded, spiralling and flowered motifs of Roccoco to the extreme, and the beast's castle looks like a big gold/brass jungle. The negative is that in order to see all this in full glory, director Bill Condon pulls his camera back so far that it becomes pretty obvious that we are in a sound stage.Emma Watson has all the beauty of Belle, but not enough of the charisma. She is small, composed and vulnerable, and strangely unimpressionable. During the Be Our Guest number, she stares at the spectacle as if she on her forty fifth take and in need of a coffee. Her singing voice is fine, but she underplays her numbers.How much credit to give Dan Stevens for his performance of the Beast, I'm not sure. Together with the painters/animators of his face, he does bring some humanity but not a great deal of character. As for the other inhabitants of the castle, The CGI bring Lumiere, Cogsworth and Mrs. Potts to life impeccably, but makes the mistake of minimizing their facial features, thus rendering out their character. What we get are not humans cursed with the form of house ware, we get house ware that talks and moves.The best part of the movie is the middle act; between the second wolves attack and the iconic Beauty and the Beast dance scene. Condon tries to play cupid and get Belle and the Beast to fall in love. The script helps him by giving him some admirable new material to work with, but he cuts his these contemplative scenes too short. As a music number Beauty and the Beast succeeds in summoning a bit of warm and fuzzy nostalgia. This is the only song which comes close to making you feel like you were watching the material for the first time. Whats missing is the chemistry.Condon stages a chaotic rendition of the fight between Gaston's mob and the Beast's army of house furniture, leading to Gaston and Beast coming face to face. Condon falls short here too by not giving them much of a fight. He also rushes the final spectacle of the movie where the beast is turned back into a prince. Belle watches and doesn't even flinch. She takes one looks at him and inherently seems to know what is going on, then they lock lips. The transformation of all the others (back into humans) is done with a bit more flair, not to mention humour.Minus the muscles and singing voice, Luke Evans makes for a realistic Gaston, but it is his side kick 'gay' LeFou who hogs the spotlight. More than any individual, the imagery itself is the real star of the show, and there is too much of it. the scenery is over lit, it goes on forever and the camera never stays still. There is enough spectacle that you become almost numb to it. Beauty and the Beast leaves you feeling depressed for all the people who Disney is cheating out of they're money. the movie itself feels like merchandise in a Disney store. It's a superficially enjoyable carbon copy of something real.",6,1,3,3 June 2017
Sicario," Dreary movie that falls flat and wastes talent
","Dreary is the best word that comes to mind if I had to pick one to describe SicarioDramatically uninvolving, sluggishly paced, and poorly acted, Sicario gives us a sample of the Federal Bureau's war on drugs with Mexico without illuminating anything about the people involved that makes it a story worth telling.Emily Blunt is massively underwhelming in the main role. She goes through the motions with no motivation other than doing the scripts bidding, and she lacks the fortitude needed to be a convincing FBI agent.Director Denis Villeneuvre was a small Quebecois director who has, in relatively short time, found his way into Hollywood. It is truly a remarkable achievement because he does not make loud or bright movies, his movies are very quiet. His approach was better suited to his last film Prisoners (which resembled se7en) but in Sicario he fails to channel the same level of ominous and suspense that made you hold your breath at times. Aside from some spectacular aerial shots Sicario is Visually uninteresting, bland and dramatically empty.",5,1,5,28 May 2017
The Descent," A decent descent
","The Descent uses an old horror formula, but with a few twists, a little artistic creativity, and some clever directing, the movie succeeds where other horror films have failed. The tension is well orchestrated, and highly subjective, bringing a real sense of claustrophobia to the viewer. Some effort has been put forward to building a realistic, scary setting rather than an artificial fantasy world like that in 'The Cave', and with a lot of hand-held camera-work and minimalist lighting, The illusion is real enough to get the audience hooked. In the Appalachian mountains, six girls go on a cave exploration trip, deep under the earth. Soon the fun adventure ends, and a real one begins when they get lost, and find themselves stocked by strange creatures who are fast agile climbers, and vicious carnivores.The funny thing about The Descent is how the scares are quite predictable, but they make you jump anyway. Sometimes you know when something is going to happen, but you don't know what. Other times you know what is going to happen, but you don't know when. When the ending comes, It's quite obvious that there is going to be one last surprise, but it comes in a way that is not only surprising, but provides a clever bookending to the protagonist's journey, the journey into madness.If this is your kind of thing, I can assure you that you wont be bored. From the moment the characters make their descent into the inevitable, we the viewers descend with them.",7,0,1,26 May 2009
Jack Reacher," Unmemorable and confused Crime/Action/Mystery/Noir movie
","Some moments stick, most do not.The one individual who makes Jack Reacher worthwhile is Werner Herzog. Playing a Gulag survivor, he channels up all the bone chilling eeriness of the best Bond villains, while being an authentic human being. He has limited screen time, but he makes you wish he had more.And then there is Tom Cruise. The coming of age star does a more refined version of his 'posing for the camera' style of acting. His depiction of Reacher wanders back and forth between broody and completely carefree relaxed.Director Chris McQuarrie handles the movie with likewise inconsistency. He ping pongs between realism and gimmick from scene to scene. There are two or three fisticuffs scenes that are as cheesy as Steven Segal movies, while other talkier scenes resemble John Le Carre material.Macquarie stages a good car chase to kick off the last act; one that is more streamlined and coherent than most other car chases. It ends in a laugh as Reacher disappears into a crowd in a fashion that only Cruise could get away with. Then comes the big climactic action piece on a construction site. It is endurable until we come to that typical moment where Reacher and another ruffian decide to drop their guns and punch it out (cue eye roll)By trying to please intelligence and non-intelligence simultaneously, Jack Reacher turns into a confused movie. Its sole achievement is getting a performance out of Werner Herzog.",5,0,0,1 June 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A bit funnier but mostly the same thing
","'How can you guys be friends? all you do is argue.' asks Gomora's sister. For most of the first half, I confess, I was asking myself the very same question. The script is 80% bickering, which makes Guardians paradoxically entertaining and not. The banter is the film's highlight, but its not easy to invest in a family that only ever points out the worst in each other. Rocket has enough material to be an insult comic.Director James Gunn's strength is his ability to set up laughs both in dialog and in shot. He has a good eye for framing shots to make the most out of the visual gags. Just when you think the movie is starting to take itself seriously, he throws in another punch.Perhaps it could be argued then that his weakness is restraint. The action set pieces are a circus of animation and disorienting camera work, and there are far too many colours on the palette (including pink). When everything is dazzling to look at, nothing is. The climax is an especially shaky fiasco, pitting the guardians against Quill's super villain father and his generic super villain plot involving control of the universe. Here we have Kurt Russell playing Kurt Russell, and never knowing how seriously to take himself from line to line.The script makes it a priority to shed light on Peter Quill, but less for the sake of the character and more for the sake of embedding plot device; Isn't that always the case? It's a shame that Chris Pratt has nothing to bring beyond his face. Even his one liners fall flat, because he takes himself so darned seriously for the camera.Stan Lee gets his usual funny cameo but more unexpected is a guest appearance by Sylvestor Stallone, who is just in the movie long enough (and not too long) to be good.",6,1,2,13 November 2017
In Time," Watchable, sometimes engaging, but generally underwhelming
","In a society where time is money (yes literally, time is the new currency), and the average citizen is programmed to live twenty-five years, a poor kid from the slums finds himself on the run when he is accused of illegally holding a hundred and ten years on his life clock.I see a great idea behind In Time, but it never aspires to anything more than a chase scene movie. Andrew Nichol's third feature works on a superficially as an action film that doesn't rely on bullets and explosions, but the experience feels a bit too much like a video game. (especially when the characters are constantly rushing to refuel their time clock). Characterization is fairly wooden, and the whole movie is cut together in a manner that makes you feel like it's all taking place within a few city blocks. I would have liked to have seen a bit more helicopter mounted camera work myself.Although he's far from being a good actor, Justin Timberlake is good at making a boring character feel less boring, by bringing some energy. Here, that's definitely a positive. Part of Timberlake's strength of course is that he has wit. The same cannot be said about Amanda Seyfried, who is once again adorably boring. That said, perhaps she shows a little improvement over her last couple performances.What bothers me most about In Time however, is the credibility of the setting. Of all the Orwellian societies I've seen in the movies, this is the one that struck me as the one that would never function. Nichol has taken a potent concept and put it forward in a kind of B- grade fashion. It's not impossible to watch, but it's not really worth watching.",6,2,3,25 January 2012
Thor," A baroque but dumb entry in swords and sorcery
","Thor rumbles violently enough to shake the theatre, and if that's all you want than that's all you'll get. It's a film that looks spectacular but sounds lame. Such a baroque project doesn't deserve such a bad screenplay which is comprised of stilted dialogue and bad plotting. Swords and Sorcery is tricky, not many films get it right, and Thor is an example of why. There are too few surprises. It's not all that hard to figure out where the movie is going, and although it effectively gets a few laughs in, Thor feels rather humourless and doesn't have much of a soul. There isn't much of a character to the protagonist, and subsequently not much for actor Chris Hemsworth to work with. In fact, I strongly felt he got upstaged by his co-star/love interest. Natalie Portman is quite delightful, and far more frisky than I'm used to seeing in her, the movie becomes equally brisky when she's on screen.For a film as Theatrical in appearance as Thor, it comes across as slightly disappointing that it fails to raise a pulse or generate excitement. The only time it comes close is in one scene where Thor, on Earth, must break into a Quarentine to retrieve his hammer. which is wedged in stone and nobody can pull it out. The only thing more discouraging than that is the fact that nobody has considered the option of breaking the stone.If you plan to go see Thor, my advice is this. don't see it in 3-D, because there are parts where it's too dark to see anything, and don't even bother to make connections between this movie and Viking mythology. Thor will satisfy some, but I wasn't too impressed.",6,1,3,6 May 2011
The Shape of Water," the water is shallow
","Sketchy is the first word that comes to my after seeing Del Toro's the Shape of Water; a film of crude story telling, gimmicky characters, and obvious direction.
How on earth did this win over the Academy.This rendition of the beauty and the beast tale, pairs a mute janitor with a captive swamp monster. Bathed in an oversaturated color palette, the movie looks and plays like a comic book where the characters have no free will and are mostly representational, including the bible thumping villain, who (for no needed reason) also makes a perverted sexual move on our protagonist. Del Toro's decision to make the heroine mute is so that she can learn to communicate with the creature via sign language. If you stop to think about it , you don't need to be speechless in order to communicate with hand gestures. Just imagine all the things that Eliza would say to the creature if she could speak, Maybe she could even make a couple of jokes, which would be a blessing to this rather humourless enterprise. There is a greater feeling that Eliza is made mute. cause she needs to be vulnerable and sympathetic. The romantic relationship feels rushed and has no shape, in fact the whole movie feels a good half hour shorter than it should be. It's possible that Del Toro came under studio pressure to fit the story into two hours, but as a result, certain important devices like Eliza's strange sexual fetish are barely illuminated.It is bewildering that a del Toro movie could have a creature as boring as this one. The texture is there, but the character is not. Bland in personality and largely inanimate, his primary function is to be a love interest, in a love story that is hard to relate to. Admirable set decoration is the only highlight of the movie.",5,6,10,10 June 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," This is what I'm talking about
","Having seen the Matrix quite recently, I do believe that there is nothing special about it anymore. The reasons are numerous, but the most obvious of which is that Avatar does what it does only better. What bothers me most about the Matrix however, is that it is more of an idea than it is a movie. Too much of the screenplay is exposition from badly delivered super cheesy dialogue, and the movie just needs more action. Well, good thing then for Matrix Reloaded, which gives us just that. Now that we are in the world, we get to see Neo and his gang kick-butt in it. If it didn't take about ninety minutes of screen time (in The Matrix) to enter the world, there would have been room for some of this adrenaline. The action of course comes at the cost of story, but it's not like there was much of one to begin with anyways. My one complaint about this film is the anti-climax, of the last twenty-thirty minutes. I guess if I am going to give you advice it would be this. If you thought the Matrix was interesting yet mediocre, don't walk away so fast. Matrix Realoaded takes things up a notch and may give you what you want.",Null,0,1,25 April 2010
Zombieland," A scream of laughter
","What a great way to start a career for Ruben Fleischer, (and I'm not being sarcastic). Following in the gory footsteps of George Romero and Robert Rodriguez, Fleischer brings the story to life for eighty minutes of virtually flawless fun. I guess it could have been a bit longer, but I am fine with it.When the story begins, the world is already a hellhole. A virus has turned the world into a Zombie feeding ground. Our hero and narrator is young Columbus, who takes on the world solo, and stays alive because he follows his thirty one principles, which include: wear your seat belt, check the back seat, and don't be a hero. One day he teams up with Tallahassee; a twinkie-loving, trigger happy cowboy The two of them later team up with Witchita and Little Rock; a couple of sister bandits, cute but dangerous. They all agree to head for Pacific Playland California, where there are supposedly no zombies. Along the way they get to know each other like a family.It ain't scary for a moment, but it ain't dull for a moment either. There are jokes here there and everywhere. Only six members of the cast are not zombies, (well maybe seven). four are our heroes, one is a nerdy gas station clerk, and one is (I'm not supposed to say, but you may find out sooner or later). As a horror comedy, this film is one step above many of its predecessors (the most recent of which is Shawn of the Dead), because it offers likable characters, possibly the most memorable since Tremors, twenty years ago. Although they are not perfectly rounded, we spend just enough time with them to know who they are, what they want and so on and so forth. Now that I think about it, if this movie does well enough (and especially considering the ending) There might be a sequel in store, but that is another movie. Go out and enjoy this one for what it is.",8,2,6,3 October 2009
The Witch," initially interesting film that is hungry for cheese, and sticks of it
","Perhaps the idea of a witch in the woods preying on a humble Christian family living at its edge was just too strait for writer / director Robert Eggars.I liked the set up and the first half. We are presented with a small handful of intelligent and sympathetic characters and there is a clear sense of where (but not what) the threat is. Then just past the half way mark, the scenes get progressively silly and derivative of better horror movies. You feel the irony of a witchcraft movie that has been possessed and lost its soul and direction.The decision to use strong period dialect is simultaneously frustrating and intriguing. It commands the audience to be intelligent listeners but there are times when sentences get muddled underneath the heavy British accents. The theme of fearing abandonment by god (or possession by darkness,) is prevalent as the story gets underway. At first it feels like a historically accurate motive for character vulnerability, but instead it becomes a device for hokey paranoia as our characters start pointing fingers and accusing each other of witchcraft. The dramatic momentum that slowly accumulates in the first hour comes undone in the last half hour. The Witch starts as a story about characters but regretfully caves in and conforms to the horror genre by summoning gimmicks like the possessed animal that turns on its master. Once the chaos starts to pick up you get the feeling that a lame ending is inevitable. The last scene of a movie is visually quite strong without being showy, but the punchline feels meaningless beyond saying that darkness prevails; again very generic for a horror film.Strong acting and eerie scenery are the additional highlights, but the finished product is neither scary nor memorable.",5,9,17,14 June 2017
Crazy Heart," Worth every cent
","Even though one could argue that the film is not without some fault, it's hard not to admire a film like Crazy Heart, a story full of heart, soul, musical and acting talent. Even when it's contrived there is something quite natural about the film. The majority of critics have said that Bridges is great but the movie is good. I personally think they are both worth their weight in gold.Crazy Heart is about the road to recovery. Otis 'Bad' Blake is a Texan country star, fifty- seven, broke, drunk and sick of life and crappy little gigs. Things turn when he means a young journalist looking for an interview, and he gets into a (somewhat sudden relationship with her). But in order for her to completely accept him (posibly even as a new father for her kid) he has to clean up his act and stop the drinking and drugs, which up till now have been slowly killing him.There is no denying that Jeff Bridges is at the top of his game. He isn't too bad as a musician either. This is Maggie Gyllenhall's best performance yet, and after In Bruge, it may be Colin Farrell's best as well. There is not much of a story, but Crazy Heart is one of those extremely rare cases where it doesn't matter so much. That has to count for something too. So pick up your Crazy Heart and give this film a try.",8,1,2,25 April 2010
Mudbound," About as good as it can be (with such a derivative script)
","Mudbound stands as tall as it can, on its conviction and the quality of the performances, but its feet are sinking into the ground under the weight of too many clichés. The material is too familiar; kindness overwhelming racial tension, disgruntling aftermath of war and family feuding tied to a fallen American dream. It is heavily saturated in themes that are as rich as they are unoriginal, and the script is comprised of recycled lines like 'At least I looked 'em in the eye when I killed 'em' and 'You're not a big war hero, you're a drunk.'But the movie still gets by. It's a smoothly interwoven soap opera about two families the McAllens (white) and the Jackson's (Black) living on the same piece of Mississippi farmland, both with a son who has gone (and come back from) the war. The sons become friends. Together they wallow in self pity, but deep down they have a yearning to be back there, where they feel they belong, where they are seen as heroes, and where colour matters not.The early scenes in the movie are cut fairly short to accommodate the exposition of an ensemble cast As a result, the opening act feels a bit rushed, but it succeeds in setting up a realized and sympathetic environment. In so far as the movie has any breakthroughs, it showcases rising star Garrett Hedlund in best acting to date. He sports a Glarke Gable moustache that is so sexy its almost distracting in a film where everyone is covered in dirt. but the mud is the real star of the movie. It brings a reality to an otherwise dreamy landscape of warm sunsets and endless fields of green.",6,17,37,19 November 2017
30 Days of Night," 30 days of blood and boredom
","If it is a traditional gore fest you want, 30 Days of Night is just the thing for you. The film has its roots in Night of The Living Dead. Personally, I think this formula is getting a bit dull. Just occasionally a filmmaker shows up with a fresh idea in mind, Like Ruben Fleischer with this years hit Zombieland, or before that, Robert Rodriguez with Dusk till Dawn. Everything else is either a remake or a movie like 30 Days of Night. Although these vamps are about as ferocious as they come, they have about as little impact on the film as the heroes who fight them. 30 days of Night is just a bore.In Barstow Alaska (the northern most point in the state, the last day of sun sees half the town pulling out to go south with the birds. For thirty days every year, no sunlight will ever reach that far north. It is the perfect feeding ground for a family of vampires who show up out of nowhere. The few dozen residents who are staying, get reduced to a few within a matter of hours. The sheriff, has to find a way to keep everyone alive for the next month, until Mr golden sun comes back.To say that the movie fails because it is unoriginal would be ineffective criticism. More specifically the movie has no energy. It is too slow. Of course there is nothing wrong with that, provided the film offers solid suspense like Aliens. 30 days of Night offers none. Instead it gives us copious amounts of blood which won't even make you flinch. The only positive thing that stays with you when you walk away from the film, is Danny Huston's performance as the head vampire, kind of amusing. A few nice shots here and there as well as a credible electronic score shine through, but I think 30 Days of Night is dismissible, and should be left in the shadows.",5,1,3,4 November 2009
Army of Darkness," Ha Ha Horror, very good
","To summarize. a little more plot, and tongue-in-cheek humor (or in this case, out of cheek), makes Army of Darkness not only the best in Sam Raimi's series, but one of the best comedic horrors. With the first Evil Dead, the gore got too distracting, with the second, the humor was fine but there was practically no plot. Army of Darkness balances all the elements just right. It offers goofy fun, and a satisfactory form of closure to the series.We pick up from where we left off in Evil Dead II. Ash has been transported back to Medieval Europe. In the course of eighty quirky minutes he goes from being one of King Arthur's chained slaves to the leader of his army. According to the prophecy of the book of the dead, he is destined to save mankind from the army of darkness. Which he does, before getting transported home.I actually found myself laughing aloud quite frequently, and with the possible exception of 'Lake Placid', I don't think any horror movie has done that to me. Even from the opening shot, which is comical, you know right away that this is going to be a fun movie. This is Sam Raimi at his best. Enjoy.",8,3,4,29 May 2009
Scream 2," Shame
","Aside from all the great jokes (even better than the first), Scream 2 does nothing else right. It is clear from all the self-reflective comedy that Wes Craven is desperate to show that his series his more than bloody, perverted and gimmicky horror. Ironically, Scream 2 makes the same mistake as every other horror sequel which can be labeled gimmick, it copies the first. Not only is Scream 2 less scary but it is frequently laughable. Watching our killer chasing his shrieking victims wielding the knife resembles a Scooby-Doo chase, totally unscary. Just as it was in the first, the climax is the dumbest part of the film. Not only that, but some of is a direct rip- off of one of the great horror classics, I won't tell you which one, but I'll give you a hint (angry mama). Despite potential, there are no screams to be had here, but if you liked the first, then I guess you will like this one too.",5,0,4,30 June 2009
Kong: Skull Island," A film of stunning scenery and shallow thrills
","Some of the superficial elements that make up Kong: Skull Island, almost make the film worth watching, almost. An exotically stunning picture where the rain forests are so bright and golden as if sunlight was radiating from in between the trees. Kong emerges under the fiery halo of a setting telephoto sun that takes up half the screen. But it was that that moment when I began to have this feeling that I've had too often before, the movie is spectacle and little substance.We begin with John Goodman convincing a senator to fund an expedition to a newly discovered island (captured by satellite camera). He also gets the luxury of a military escort. Enter Samuel L. Jackson as the commander, perfectly type cast with his bravado Schick that is no longer entertaining. The film also succeeds in wasting Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson. The highlight of the cast, is John C. Riley. Stranded on the island for two decades, he has befriended the local indigenous people and knows all the Islands secrets. His humour and energy, are a relief from watching everyone else perform with zero enthusiasm. As for King Kong, He is the biggest we have seen yet in a major motion picture. Unfortunately he is stuck in a movie that is not 'King Kong'; a movie that about a monster finding his humanity. This Kong is all about attitude and not soul. The idea is that he is the guardian protector of the island, who fights to keep nature in balance, by controlling the numbers of the other big inhabitants. He is the last of his kind, and his family was killed by a species that looks like an amphibious version of the distinctive skulled ape in Temple Run. The climax pits Kong against the big daddy of these beasts, a riveting fight scene but with an inevitable outcome. Other highlights include a daddy 'super' long and another giant insect that can disguise itself as a decrepit fallen tree. The jarheads in the movie are virtually nothing more than bodies to feed to creatures like these. In fact the movie often feels like a realized version of the games we used to play with dinosaurs and little toy soldiers.Director Jordan Vogt Roberts seems to be mimicking Michael Bay films. You can see it in his use of slow motion, his stagy camera angles, and framing, and in his comic book color palette. He handles his action scenes with a greater sense of orientation, but like Bay, he fails to summon any suspense, thrill or anticipation. The film always seems too eager to get to the action oriented punchline of every scene. The finished product, is a sexy looking, 50's throwback monster movie, with lots of crazy beasts, stunning scenery and nothing in the way of character development or intelligent dialog. Samuel L. Jacksson points a gun and says, 'unless you tell me what I don't know, I will blow your head off.' You can't get much cheesier than that right?",6,5,8,12 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Worth the two year wait.
","Attack of the Clones wasn't much of a movie, but it was enough to provoke my two year hype for this one. That's the second longest I've waited for a film's release (after Avatar). Well Episode III proved not only to be worth the wait, but in some ways it is the best entry in Star Wars.It is certainly the most important chapter. It is here, during the middle of the clone wars that Anakin becomes Vader. The first half of the movie reminds me a bit of Titanic. James Cameron dedicated a fair amount of time to reveal how majestic, strong and epic the ship was, and we the audience are meant to wonder just how is it possible that she is gonna sink in an hour and a half (movie time). In a similar manner, we see during the first act of Revenge of the Sith, that Anakyn has become a legitimate Jedi, loyal to the council, and far less egotistical than in Episode II. Just how could he possibly end up becoming cinema's most famous villain?Hayden Christianson, who was awful in Episode II, has managed to get into character this time, and is far more convincing. We the audience actually believe that he is tormented, whereas in Episode II he would just say aloud 'I'm tormented' and we are supposed to understand. The performance that drives this movie however, is Ian McDirmod as Emperor Palpatine (formerly Chanselor). He didn't have a whole lot to do in any of the other movies.From the beginning, Revenge of the Sith is engaging. It wastes no time on the kind of boring exposition that bogged down Episode II. Then again there is really no need. That is what the opening crawl is for.Episode III completed the saga, but these six movies will survive till the end of humanity practically. It kinda makes you wonder what George Lucas plans to do with the rest of his life.",Null,2,4,1 May 2010
Inception," Exceptional Inception
","In this day and age, the term 'summer blockbuster' has become somewhat degrading. It implies mindless entertainment. Inception is a summer blockbuster but also a legitimate motion picture. It is a well thought out, inventive story which flirts with surrealism, expressionism, and post-modernism, and I suppose literally speaking, futurism too. Despite being convoluted, the story is rhythmic, but you do have to focus. This is not a film for the weak of mind.Christopher Nolan presents a future where man can control dreams. Cobb makes a living from stealing the dreams of others, but since being accused of killing his wife, he has fled the United States and in now in Japan. An executive gives Cobb the chance to return home free of charge if he does a job for him. The mission: assemble a crew and enter the mind of Robert Fisher Jr. (the son of a dying corporate emperor.) Cobb must put the idea in Jr.'s head to bring down his father's work. Needless to say, It is a very dangerous game, and if he screws up he could be stuck in a dream for who knows how long.To call Incaption ambitious would be an understatement. It is so complex that one must wonder how this could be pulled off. In the course of two and a half hours, Inception takes us to a dream within a dream within a dream, but Nolan ensures that his viewer stays focused and entertained.Inception is not a very demanding script for acting, but the lead role of Cobb does require more than a little investment. Leo DiCaprio does the job well. Even though (facially speaking) he will always look like the same twenty year old standing on the bow of the Titanic, he feels like a man in this motion picture. I liked the ending of this film. You kind of expect it in the sense that it would be unlike Chris Nolan to do something conventional, so there is a tiny little twist, appropriate is size, it doesn't feel too cheaply done. If you commit yourself, You'll find that Inception delivers the goods. It ain't an easy movie, but it is definitely a good watch for movie. goers",8,2,6,21 July 2010
Wonder Woman," Makes me Wonder
","Looking past the Gal Gadot appeal, Is there anything that Wonder Woman brings to an overcrowded table? This is the same origin story as everyone else in the Marvel and DC universes. The character has a quest hinging on a romanticized destiny...check, a love interest...check, a nemesis...check, the bad guys have a secret weapon....check. More bewildering is the praise of feminism that has elevated the film to greater acclaim than it deserves. This is nonsense. The hero is a heroine; that is pretty much it. Gadot has enough conviction to command the screen but she is not a great actress, Fortunately she doesn't need to be. The script doesn't give her much of an inner life. In particular, her romance with Steve Trevor is fairly staged and seldom organic. Her claim to understand the power of human love by the end of the movie is no more earnest than Trump's claim to understanding the problems of America.Wonder Woman is unusual in its structure. It has an enjoyable middle section bookended by a fairy cheesy first and third act. Diana leaves her home in the over green screened Amazon world and enters WWII Europe with Steve Trevor. The film handles her displacement in the real world with some good humour before allowing her to shine on the front lines of the battle. The action scene are fine, although there are a few too many kicks and punches in slow motion. Watching this effect in 21st century cinema is like watching a sporting gear commercial. The climax is disappointing because it is dull. Diana exchanges gimmicky banner with her nemesis Ares while engaging it a relatively lifeless fireball fight.The movie succeeds in making you want to see more of Gadot in the hope that maybe a sequel will have more imagination in the writing. However, that seems unlikely.",5,4,12,9 November 2017
Blow," A promising story that is poorly told, (get your coke somewhere else)
","Not a minute goes by in Blow that doesn't feel reminiscent of Goodfellas. But whereas Scorsese's movie, was fiery, witty, credible, and involving this one is cumbersome, overlong, and contrived.Blow starts off strong and ends strong, but the hour and a half in between is burdened by a sense of repetition, an inability to flesh out character, and the story duration (which covers about two to three decades in the life of American Cocaine entrepreneur George Jung) ages badly. It cheats the viewer by using montage to cover vast periods of time in which explanation and exposition are denied, and Johnny Depp is aged using the most phony looking wigs I've seen in ages. Jung goes from zero to hero in a matter of seconds, and his daughter ages ten years in four shots. Unlike Goodfellas, Blow is too seldomly grounded in direction, making it difficult for the viewer to invest in on a consistent basis. It has it's moments to be sure, but it didn't do enough for me to recommend it.",5,9,14,10 October 2010
1408," Checking out? I don't think so
","In 1408, an eccentric writer checks into a supposedly cursed room at the Dolphin hotel in New York. He plans to use his observations for a chapter in his book, but instead he goes on the ride of his lifeI think I can see 1408 working as a short story, but as a movie it feels overlong, and overstuffed. There isn't enough plot to sustain a hundred minute running length. 1408 tries too hard. The horror devices are force fed to us in such a way that the movie never feels truly scary. It is certainly startling, no question there. 1408 doesn't generate suspense as much as it generates a sense of entrapment. We have nowhere to go. Unfortunately neither does the story, and it takes forever to end. I think one of the worst decisions that 1408 makes is that it ignores the value of claustrophobia. The picture is surprisingly over lit for a horror film, perhaps as an attempt to avoid unrealistic lighting clichés. The camera is quite wide, and there is always to much in the frame. The room itself doesn't feel scary at all, and the devices used to make it scary are familiar and there are too many of them. The windows shutting is one that particularly bothers me, because it feels just plain unrealistic. PArt way through the film, 1408 attempts to justify this unrealism by turning it to surrealism. It becomes more of a fantasy, with rooms in the fridge and snow falling, paintings coming alive. 1408 is a very relentless film, it never lets up, to some degree it entertains, but it's too heavy handed for comfort and is never scary or clever enough to pass for a good horror movie. It's just a watchable one",6,0,0,20 December 2010
Step Up," Schematic but enjoyable feel-good movie
","Step up, plays it entirely by the book which may seem safe for a film maker, but ironically can be equally risky, in the worst case scenario your film could look recycled. This dance concerns about a break dancing street kid (Tyler) who is forced to do a couple hundred community service hours for an art school which he was caught breaking into. The first thing that gets his attention when he starts doing his time, is a girl in the dance hall, whose dance partner has just broken his foot. Tyler volunteers to replace him, Nora is not surprisingly doubtful, but to her surprise Tyler is quite good, but how committed will he be to this, when it means leaving his old life/friends behind?Step Up does it better than most, but not as good as the best. It does it's best to treat the characters as human beings, not just bodies to dance. Jenna Dewan and Channting Tutum are a decent screen couple not so much because the are cute but because they feel like real people. It These are two kids who were NOT meant for each other, they don't look it and they don't act it, but when they dance they appear flawless. Step Up's problems are screenplay related. It is never unpredictable, and for that matter, it's not super believable either. This is not a film for an intelligent audience, it is a feel good movie, no more no less, but it's catchy, never too shallow, and It's enjoyable",7,0,0,31 October 2010
Vanilla Sky," Needs a few touches, but I enjoyed it
","From my point of view, it is a bit difficult to know how much credit to give Vanilla Sky for integrity or smarts when taking into account that it is a remake of a film which I have never seen (Abre Los Ojos). Cameron Crowe's remake (regardless of what it owes to the Spanish film) has its weak spot but is fairly enjoyable. The movie is part drama/romance part surrealism. Surrealist films are pretty tricky. I like my surrealism to be appreciable and clever (Donnie Darko, Altered States) rather than self- indulgent and disorienting (Mulholland Dr.) Vanilla Sky is a case of the former. It is arty, yet manages to tell a narratively coherent story, which allows for viewer investment. Vanilla Sky can range from funny to frightening and or from cold to touching. It is full of mood swings, and despite the fact that the finished product feels like three movies, it is never dull. (although the ending may be a couple minutes too long)What I like about Vanilla Sky is how it (eventually) acknowledges that the viewer is being put on a borderline of dream and reality. Instead of an 'open to interpretation' scenario, The screenplay comes with a good share of climactic explanation, which enriches the thematic material and the emotion. It is essential that Vanilla Sky be a subjective story. We have to be one with Tom Cruise. Even though he is not entirely a respectable character, we come to understand him by the end. The character, I have no problem with. I was more bothered by the performance. Cruise brings his character to life in a fashion that is too spectacular for comfort. Basically he overacts. This kind of 'kabuki theatre' performance may have been more understandable if Stanley Kubrick was directing. In scene one, he drives through Times square, and there is not a soul to be seen. This I find impressive. It hard to imagine any film production company (not even Spielbergs) having the power to clear and block off one of the World's most famous and busiest commerical areas. (Usually movie companies come to Toronto to recreate New York). For all I know this could have been a digital effect. Either way, it looks flawless.If anything, it just goes to show that Vanilla Sky always has your attention, right from the beginning. To be able to sustain that for two hours in a movie that has a sense of unconventional artiness to it is impressive. It's not a terrific movie, but it has been thought through and executed well enough, that it is recommendable as both a surrealist movie and a emotional drama.",7,1,3,20 October 2010
X-Men: First Class," Imperfect, but I'll give it a passing grade
","Although not underwhelming, There is something missing from X-Men first class. I felt it took a little long to get going and there were too many characters that didn't amount to enough. As an origin story X-Men first class did an adequate job of getting the characters where they need to be without too much contrivance, As an action film, it's coherent and competent, often visually stimulating, but the story was a bit scrappy. I felt it took a little long to get going and there were too many characters that didn't amount to enough.Michael Fassbender may have second billing but the movie belongs to him. The majority of the drama in the film surrounds him, and subsequently his performance was the best. James MacAvoy doesn't quite have Fassbender's commanding presence but he brings a nice slyness to the picture. Jennifer Lawrence meanwhile is just a waste of talent in a role that is surprisingly under defined, and as Raven, she looked a little clunky.As I said, the film is a little slow to get going but the climax was strong enough. I was impressed with the camera work, and the overall assembly was nice, The appearance of Michael Ironside was a cute touch My only comments would be that Beast looks too much like Cookie monster, and Kevin Bacon spends a bit to much time in a Greek helmet that looks rather big on him.Looking back on the experience, I'll say that X-Men first class has skill but the product is incomplete. It's a body that needs a little more flesh on it.",6,1,4,11 September 2011
Toy Story 3," Great conclusion, NOT a great movie, but entertaining still
","Toys haven't come alive on the big screen in over ten years, which means that Toy Story 3 when it comes, comes with presentation, and promise, but is it a great movie.....no, just a good one.The problem is not so much that the Disney/pixar crew fail to rejuvenate the life of their toys after ten years, the problem is that frankly, the movie doesn't feel all that clever. It is funny to be sure, but it falls into a couple of unprofessional traps.The first problem is that Toy Story 3 feels unconvincingly plotted. Not only is it contrived but it doesn't feel like there is much story here. Andy is leaving for college, and plans to put all his toys away in the attic, but in a strange mix up, they end up in the garbage, and through another mix up, they end up in a day care centre full of destructive toddlers. They plan to escape, but it's not so easy, considering some of the larger toys led by a big Strawberry odoured bear, are running the place like a jail, and they DON'T like new toys.Another problem in Toy Story 3, which is actually typical of a lot of Disney's recent works, is that the studio is no longer able to characterize villains. The likes of extravagant figures such as Jaffar, Scar, Cruella Deville, do not exist anymore. Disney villains today are all manufactured like Toys, equipped with nothing but a sour face, and a stupid motive. My one problem with WALL-E was that Auto (the villain) was arguably Disney's worst, but the Teddy here is a close second.So if Toy Story 3 fails, then where does it succeed....well it's funny I'll say that much, not as funny as the second, but funny. Mr Potato head, finds a new body in a cucumber, Woody flies a kite (or rather the kite flies him) Buzz gets a reprogramming which allows him to tango romantically. Jesse was the only character who I don't think was given enough to do. Her primary function is to be a love interest for Buzz, but the plot doesn't ever choose to embrace that, so instead she is sort of left tangling by her pull string.As a conclusion to a trilogy, Toy Story 3 works just fine I think. It uses a device that feels credible and heart warming, and to a degree thematically enriching. This movie is supposed to be about the coming of age, but the ending is where it really delivers this. What would have been better is if the whole movie could deliver it, Toy Story 3 feels a bit over rated. It's funny enough, but it's not enriching enough, and comes across as more a product designed with the intention of making as much money as possible rather than a movie into which some of cinema's best animators can put their heart and soul into. As a money maker, Toy Story certainly gets an A+ but as a movie, I can only give it a B, still worth seeing though.",7,0,2,29 October 2010
Before Sunrise," Probably the smartest contemporary romantic flick
","There are three types of Romance. First you have those with Sex and no Brains (Titanic is the best movie in this category) Then you have Brains but No sex. Third is no sex and no brains, a category which gives you rubbish like twilight. The best Romance films are those which fall into the second category. Most folks immediately name Gone with the Wind or Casablanca as the smartest romance, but how about something more contemporary for a change. Before Sunrise could rival either of these pictures as the most intelligent romance of the 20th century, and while it doesn't actually amount to much of a story, It gets the viewer involved emotionally and intellectually. Two folks meet on a train, an American boy going to Vienna and a French girl heading for Paris, they have a long talk over lunch, and in about five minutes they becomes friends. Before long the train arrives at Vienna station, but before getting off, the boy asks if this girl wants to spend the day with him touring the city. She agrees. They have the time of their life.Before Sunrise is pretty much all talk. The two discuss many things while they wander the cobblestone streets, but the most interesting thing they discuss is Romance. This is the brilliance of Richard Linklater's script. Not only is being brilliantly self reflexive, but in a way he is poking fun at the films in the other two categories of Romance. The two discuss how cheesy relationships can be. These are clearly not dumb people, and the film is clearly not a dumb, Hollywood formula driven piece. Ergo, do not miss this one.",9,1,2,28 November 2009
Signs," Despite a few errors, it never fails to impress me.
","Using the mystic of Close Encounters, the suspense generating tricks from Jaws, and a skilled crew which includes, (DP Tak Fujimoto, and composer James Newton Howard) M. Night Shyamalan pulls through and delivers his best picture yet. Signs is not pretentious, nor does it intend to show off, or pull anything new. If fact, it feels more like a throwback to the late seventies-early eighties, when Spielberg brought the inhabitants of other worlds to ours. Signs is a slow mover, but it ain't a dull one. When it wants to, it can get inside your head, and when the moment is right, it goes bump. Hopefully this is not one that you will soon forget after viewing.In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, farmer and former reverend Graham Hess, wakes one morning to discover crop circles in his cornfields. Before long, global news is reporting circles all over the planet. As controversy starts to emerge, Hess struggles to hold his family together. They are all still recovering from the death of Mrs. Hess six months back. The signs of terror continue to grow closer and closer, until they arrive at the doorstep. And The family (along with the rest of the world) fights for not only self control, but their lives.Instead of showing the big picture like Close Encounters, Signs is far more subjective. Furthermore, while Spielberg was more keen on showing people's physical reactions to the arrival of something from another world, Shyamalan wants to show the psychological reactions, in particular that of Graham. His loss of faith in God, has turned him into a man with little or not hope, which is something he needs (and we all need) to help us in times of dire trouble. Signs is an example of the right way to form a horror movie. Rather than making us jump every ten minutes with a random shocker, Signs takes its time and relies on the fact that we the viewers don't see the threat even though we know it is there (because we catch a glimpse of it every couple scenes)As superbly crafted as it is, Signs is not without flaw. There are moments which feel highly unbelievable and contrived. for example, I strongly doubt that a TV newscaster would give a rough statement such as 'Everything they wrote about in science books is about to chance.' Also the manner in which the heroes manage to defeat the threat is not only cheap but it feels like a plot hole. (at least it is the only one).On all other grounds, Signs is near-perfect. It blends drama, sci-fi, and horror, into an evocative little movie which is definitely a big step above Hollywood mainstream.",Null,0,3,22 March 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Weird Mr. Fox
","I'll give credit where credit is due, the animation is eccentric, wacky and nifty, not to mention all the weird camera angles applied. The screenplay is...not so eccentric. Some scenes aside, this is a very dry story, not terribly colourful in performance, and lacking in old fashioned humour. I'm interested to see what kinds of films Wes Andersson grew up on that could inspire such oddities like Fanastic Mr. FoxI don't even wanna begin to describe the story. Now the last time I read Fantastic Mr. Fox was when I was Ten years ago, but I do remember it being fairly coherent, much less convoluted than this story. Well convoluted isn't the word, lets just say, The rhythm is unusual as is the dialogue for that matter. Further more, there seems to be quite a lack of it, These critters don't really have a whole lot of productive things to say to each other, sometimes it feels like dialogue for the sake of dialogue.The Music ques are kind of catchy, that's what I remember best about Fantastic Mr. Fox. The banjo in particular is not a commonly used instrument, but it's the star of the orchestra in this movie Fantastic Mr. Fox has it's ups and downs, I wouldn't recommend it as a family feature, but movie goers may get a kick out of its eccentric charm.",6,2,4,26 April 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force awakens and the audience goes Zzzzzz
","J J Abrams (with the blessing of Disney) has manages to reunite the band, but fails to awaken the force. His sence of pacing has the rushed feel of the television world, as if he thought he were making a one hour pilot. He has somehow managed to edit out almost the entire story leaving nothing but action scenes behind. Aquaintances and friendships are made between characters in such absurdly rushed fashion that it makes you yearn for the more zen pace of Lucas' writing.Kudos for the removal of all the racial stereotypes. There are no Jar Jars or Wattos here, but then again there is little in the way of imagination either. We've seen everything before, all the characters, weapons, costumes, fight scenes. They simply do not stand out in an age that is over saturated with CG characters. The one highlight in the 'animated cast' is the supreme leader Snoke seated at his throne in the shadows. If nothing else he may be the tallest speaking part in the Star Wars universe.The movie rests very much on the shoulders of two new youths Rei (Daily Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega). Both of them have the kind of Tom Cruise hyperdrive that make them essentially excellent video game characters; Two bodies who can never do a thing wrong regardless of the circumstances. In one scene Rey first demonstrates that she can use the force and pulls off a trick so easily that it insults all the long days that Luke spent training with Yoda. Finn meanwhile gets to wield the Skywalker Lightsaber, long before he has earned the right to even touch it. (This is a crown jewel in the treasury of classic film props for god sake)What this moment demostrated to me is the that film does not really have much respect for all that is sacred in Star Wars, it merely showcases the pieces. Sure we have Han and Leia back but their so their funtion is mostly plot advancement. They have a short exchange which hints at some inner demons regarding events that took place somewhere between episode 6 and this, a missed chance for a good prologue scene.",Null,4,5,1 January 2018
Ran," Strong but Sloooooooowwww
","I am not certain, but I think Ran was Akira Kurosawa's last big feature. Visually, It might be his most distinctive. Being in color opens a lot of doors to cinematography, and makes it easier to see how much artistic creativity went into the sets and costumes. There is something else distinctive about Ran. It is his slowest picture. You need extreme patience to make it through this very long movie, and you also need to understand the context of the story.Ran is Kurosawa's retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear, which many scholars say is his most difficult tragedy. The premise is identical, revolving around an old monarch who is ruined by the corruption of his sons, after he gives them power and authority. (In King Lear, they were daughters, not sons, of course.) Ran starts and ends strongly, but the problem comes down to a huge, plodding middle section. This part of the film will really test your attention span. Kurosawa deliberately makes sure that nothing happens, because he wants to evoke one single emotion...isolation. He places his principal character (and a couple of others) in the middle of nowhere, with no story progression, music, or major dialog. There are perhaps one (or even two) too many similarly grim scenes.The battles scenes are the biggest in Kurosawa's forty year body of work. Not only do they feature swords and spears but guns, cannons, and a cast of thousands. The interesting thing about those scenes is that Kurosawa, doesn't intend them to be rousing or exciting. Instead, there is a strange emotional feeling generated. The most memorable part of Ran is the very last sequence, which is visually brilliant and really disturbing. He makes a metaphor about the frailty of humanity by showing a blind man in a very particular place.Ran will leave you thinking long and hard. I have not seen a film like it and I don't think I ever will. It is not my favorite Kurosawa, but it is very much worth watching.",7,15,21,5 August 2009
Easy A," Amusing yet not quite satisfactory (B- at best)
","Easy A is probably a proud moment for Emma Stone. As far as I understand, this is her first staring role, and it gives her a chance to stretch her comedic legs. Though not terrific, she does her job. The movie as a whole does not, I'm afraid to say.The mind that though up Easy A is arguably clever, but the mind (or minds) which transfered it to the screen are not as much so. This high school comedy is burdened by a poor screenplay, and a lack of consistent humour. It starts off strong but the middle section is overlong, and tedious, and the ending is rushed and not nearly as clever as was probably intended. Easy A makes you smile, and sometimes makes you laugh, but you come away from it somewhat unsatisfied.In an attempt to avoid looking like a generic teen comedy, Easy A frequently winks at itself. It acknowledges its source material; Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlett Letter. Self-reflexive though it may be in parts, this movie still feels fairly derivative. The key is always in the details. One of the more annoying clichés in this genre (also seen here) is the utter incredibility of the adult characters. Easy A is quite mean spirited towards all the parents and teachers in the movie, and it doesn't really add to the comedic value. Stanley Tucci gets a few good one liners, but his delivery is lame. The same is true of Thomas Haden Church, Malcolm Mcdowell, and a few others.Easy A, is a movie that could use a reworking. It's cute, but it's not quite funny enough to recommend as a comedy. It may work more effectively as a date movie.",6,3,8,17 September 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Better
","Following a rather clumsy second entry, Eclispe is just the kind of third entry that the Twilight series needs. Though not great, it's Superior to Twilight and New Moon. The editing is tighter, the plot is more fluid, the cast is starting to open up, and there is more action. Even the writing, which is the worst thing about the whole series, is improved here. In addition to throwing in a few jokes, we are treated to some back story to characters which up till now have been little more than sparkling faces.The one thing about Eclipse that I didn't like was that the rivalry between Jacob and Edward is snarly and obnoxious. Bella frequently has to play referee and step between the two. In New Moon we were meant to think that Jacob is the nice boy. Now I'm not too sure I like him that much. He is presented as being a bit more selfish and immature than I think he should be.Eclispe deserves credit where credit is due, things are coming to life in a way that makes the series enjoyable to anyone outside the twilight fan base, (or at least to anyone who likes Gothic). The problem is whether, it warrents the recommendation of two predecessors, one not bad, and the other mediocre.",7,1,9,23 April 2011
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Maybe a worthy novel, but hardly a worthy film
","Neil Jordan's Inverview with the Vampire strikes me as one of those films which can only be appreciated if you read the novel, which I have not. Like Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein (which came out in the same year) this is not really a horror film, it is a glamorous Gothic drama, but not a very good one. Quite frankly it is boring, lacking in direction, and features too much dialog which is intended to be poetic or melodramatic, but instead strikes me as silly. It starts in a tiny hotel room, with a journalist played by Christian Slater. He is interviewing Louis, a dapper young fellow, who proceeds to dictate the story of how he became a vampire. It started when he met L'estad de Lioncourt in 18th century France, who offered to show him the the ways of darkness. From there the story becomes a series of strange chapters, decade after decade, century after century. If I was in Slater's shoes I would be asleep, long before Louis finished his story.One of the differences between novels and movies is the amount of story. A book can take as much time as it wants, while a movie needs to cut things down a bit for structure. It is for this reason that I am sure Interview with the Vampire is an excellent and very intriguing book. As a movie however, it is a dud.",5,1,4,8 August 2009
Gangs of New York," Powerful yet poorly told, (may grow on you with multiple viewings)
","One thing that can be said about Marty Scorsese, the man looks nothing like his movies; Five and a half feet, chirpy voice, dorky glasses, but he makes BIG dramas (though not all of them are good). Gangs of New York is a macho 19th century American epic, well designed and packs a heck of a brutal punch, but it comes with a story that is clunky, ponderous, and not very involving. Scorsese invests too much in style and not enough in substance, some of his famous tracking shots go on way too long, Leo Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz are pretty faces, but they don't have much to say or do. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is epic and memorable, but unlike There Will Be Blood (yet to come) it doesn't save the movie. In the end, Gangs of New York is kind of boring.This is how I felt the first time I saw the movie. It grew on me a little the second time when I was a bit older, and able to appreciate just how demanding a film this is. I still have a few complaints, but I won't argue that Gangs of New York is a bad film. Cinema goers, will probably see plenty of value in it, but the Marty Scorsese who brought us Raging Bull and Goodfellas is not the same guy behind this one.",Null,0,0,28 June 2010
Moon," Good idea, had potential, but is too dry and barren to enjoy
","I see an idea in Moon, but I don't see a motion picture. This character driven sci-fi/drama which explores being human feels too cold, bland and overlong to work. It takes a while to make its point, and relies on our identification with a character who is portrayed with confused acting. The last time Sam Rockwell was in space was in Galaxy Quest. There he was a scream, here he is a yawn. Moon (I suppose) works in small chunks but the big picture feels dull and not very enriching.Sam Bell, for three years, has been running an energy station on the moon. The energy harvested there supplies an environmentally friendly Earth in the near future. Sam's only companion is the station's computer, Gerty (a more mobile version of HAL 9000, with a smiley face). One day/night, Sam is investigating a wrecked harvesting machine, and inside he discovers a body.... another Sam. What does this mean? Is Sam #1 going crazy from being on the moon for too long? Is Sam #2 a clone? Is Sam #1 a clone? Are there any more bodies out there? and whose side is Gerty gonna take?Moon probably sounded good as a pitch, considering all the questions that come up once you block out the plot. Unfortunately the movie never really comes alive. The ending is the most exiting part, but ten minutes of solidity doesn't necessary warrant a time investment in eighty minutes of ponderous direction. Moon is tricky to recommend.",5,50,89,29 November 2010
True Romance," Crazy fun (even without Tarantino's direction)
","Quentin Tarantino is not in the director's chair, but True Romance feels almost entirely like his product. It has all the trademarks of the auteur he would amount to in the years that followed; the film is delightfully hammy, sprinkled with amusing banner which shows (among other things) a love for the cinema. It has a dose of Asian cinema to it, and the violence, while gratuitous, is effectively satirical. It features a cast of highly familiar faces, some who can act some who can't, but everybody pulls their weight here, and nobody upstages anybody else.In scene one, Chrisitian Slater sits at a bar and tells the girl next to him how he wishes he could be Elvis. It is ironic considering he got his wish seven years later, backing up Kevin Costner in 3000 Miles to Graceland. Tarantino loves bar scenes. Were he in the director's chair, this intro would be longer.So who IS in the director's chair then? True Romance is a film by Tony Scott, (who probably needs no introduction). Tarantino would surely not give his script to anyone unless he felt they would match his vision or intended approach. Scott clearly achieves this. The movie is played mostly for fun, yet it doesn't get carried away. Scott's direction is progressive. Tarantino films are much more slower. Even though True Romance gets increasingly more convoluted, so to does it get funnier, and it comes with a pretty good pay off. True Romance is definitely a forerunner to Pulp Fiction. Back in 1992, this would've been a good hint to the critics of what was to come from Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction was definitely his most inventive feature, but True Romance may be more fun.",8,0,1,11 June 2010
The Runaways," Not too bad, but needs much more
","'When you stop to let 'em know you got it down...it's just another town along the road' --Jackson BrowneThe sole intention of The Runaways (as a film) is to get inside the heads of the five girls who rocked the world in 1975. The film comes close to, and sometimes does hit the mark, but its general sense of drama is inconsistent. A large portion of the Runaways is too choppy, and many scenes feel like they are several minutes too short. I have a feeling that plenty of good material got lost in the editing room.I'm a little dubious about Kristen Stewart's future career as an actress. Though definitely more admireable than Twilight, her performance is torpid, and doesn't earn my sympathy. Dakota Fanning, is much better, perhaps because the camera is on her more, but she does a much better job of acting with her face.Their ability to portray rock stars on stage is impressive, but the music numbers are too brief. The Runaways left me a little frustrated, but it's still a film worth checking out, just take a moment before you go see it and ask yourself, what do you expect from it. (If it's actual music you want maybe the Runaways isn't the film for you)",6,9,23,20 March 2010
Donnie Darko," likable surrealism
","I'm not sure what I'm supposed to come away from Donnie Darko with, I would say that this is a very clever film, or a very clueless one. ( I Think) When it begins everything that follows for the next hundred minutes has happened already. That's one way to look at it. Another way would be to see it as pure surrealism like John Carpenter's In The Mouth of Madness or David Lynch's Mullholland Dr. Such films are conundrums, but the question is whether or not you are capable of watching a movie that leaves you frustrated intentionally. If surrealism is your thing, you will probably have luck with Donnie Darko. It is a good one for a movie goer.Up until the climax, we are led to believe that this is a film about a young suburban middle- class boy (Donnie) who has schizophrenia and one night envisions a large satanic looking rabbit (the anti-Harvey) to tells him to do some pretty bad things if he wants to survive the end of the world in 28 days, something hours and something seconds. The people in this film are weird, though not as much so as Mulholland Dr. (In part because the acting here is more toned down, usually) One could argue though that there are too many characters. Some of the screen time that is dedicated to the supporting cast could have gone to Donnies story, which is more important. His conversations with Frank (the rabbit) are intriguing but they are too short and too few. The climax is one that takes Donnie Darko and turns it inside out. There is no literal resolution to the thriller side of Donnie Darko, only what the viewer chooses to make of it. Is it a great movie? no, but its partial originality and evocative direction are enough to make it worth a watch.",7,2,5,7 March 2010
Pocahontas," Quite good actually
","Pocahontas and the Lion King were on the drawing board at the same time. The studio did not have much faith in the Lion King to start with. The idea of a Shakespearian tragedy in the Animal Kingdom, may have sounded too pretentious, whereas a beautiful tale which dapples in American history sounded far more enriching. Needless to say the public thought otherwise.Pocahontas was actually the last of the 20th century Disney animated features which I saw. I first viewed it five years ago. Had I seen it when I was six or seven (as I did with most of the others) I probably would have fallen asleep in five minutes. The movie's biggest weakness (and the only one I can think of) is that its effectiveness as a family feature is middling. There is a sense of mysticism and sophistication to it which may be beyond children's ability to appreciate. It is more mature than juvanaille There are no talking animals here. Instead we are offered a talking thousand year old tree, which is absolutely beautiful and further enriched by Linda Hunt's voice, but to a kid, it is more likely to come across as a wrinkly and off putting. Something else which Pocahontas sells is environmentalism, which is also beyond young children's reach. Each generation changes but I think the minimum age for Pocahontas is nine or ten.Quite frankly, I really liked it. Even though it follows a few schema like the good guy, bad guy, this motion picture seemed quite authentic. It is not afraid to get its hands a bit dirty for better emotional quality, Pocahontas at times can be quite violent. There is arguably more gun play here than in any other Disney animated feature. The musicasl numbers are not exactly sing along tunes, they feel more like songs, pieces of art, rich and warming, (sometimes a bit preachy) but effective. The romance between Captain John Smith and Pocahontas felt equally heart warming, just as much so as Beauty and the Beast. Of course it reeks of historical inaccuracy, when you know that the real Pocahontas was ten when she met Smith. Literally, she is not a princess, but she has still earned her place in the Disney princess arsenal. Of all the names in that arsenal (Cinderalla, Snow White, Jasmine, The Little Mermaid) Pocahontas is the strongest and most like a woman (as opposed to a girl). If all the Disney princesses were to race, she would win by a landslide, while most on the other contestants would trip over their gowns.The films comedic value also differs from many of its contemporaries. It feels more quirky than goofy/humorous. If you should ever have a hummingbird flying at your face at 100 miles an hour, just hold up a biscuit for a shield. Seeing as young children prefer the latter, this too contributes to the unfortunate lack of praise for Pocahontas. It is not regarded as one of the great Disneys, but it's still a fine watch. It certainly moved me.",Null,2,5,25 October 2010
The Social Network," A original movie, cold, but quite fascinating and captivating
","The Social Network is a good film to contradict a frequent argument that cinema is running out of Ideas. History is always in the making, so there are always new stories to tell. The question is not so much which stories are worth telling but how they are told. This one is worth telling and told well enough to earn its place as one of the best films of the year.FACEBOOK is among the greatest cultural innovations of the free world so far this century, and even with 500 million users, I'm not even sure the site is in its prime yet. (It has yet to be legalized in China). Ironically, the simple fact that FACEBOOK is young is the movie's only problem (from a film point of view) David Fincher is telling a story that feels incompleteImagine if Citizen Kane ended with Charles Foster becoming the king of American Newspaper. It would be an epic build up, but there would still be much to tell. That's sort of the way it feels with The Social Network. The ending is rushed, but then again what else was there to do, wait eighty years for Mark Zuckerberg to die, and make the movie then? (encompassing his whole life). The Social Network is about how Zuckerberg came to power. When the film ends, he has a little over a million users. It is a short time span to work with, but it is to the great credit of David Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin that this motion picture is without a dull moment. This is a rapid fire motion picture, is one clever line after another, and some are pretty funny. Jesse Eisenberg gives a fiery performance, aided in part by his dialogue, and I also got a kick out of one sequence with involves a kayak race directed in music video fashion (which is where David Fincher has his roots)I can definitely see the Social Network finding its way to the Academy awards. It will certainly be a proud moment for David Fincher who with each movie seems to be getting a larger voice.",8,2,5,1 October 2010
Goodfellas," Unparalled Gangster movie
","No matter how many times you watch it, Goodfellas is one of those movies which you just never grow out of. Arguably the best gangster film of the decade (but I think of all time). Martin Scorsese is able to generate just about every kind of tone a film could have; humorous, touching, depressing, grim. This is superbly written and acted, and ten times more down-to-Earth and involving than the Godfather. If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Goodfellas.....see it.The first thing we see on screen are the words 'The following is based on a true story' or something like that. In the twenty first century, those words are the hottest marketing gig going. Goodfellas was before those days. Next we meet Henry Hill, who became a gangster at grade school age, and went on to become hot stuff. He helped pull off the famous Lufthansa heist, but did he and his buddies get away with it? Goodfellas is able to cover about three and a half decades in two hours, without felling too slow or too fast. The story, is direct and detailed, and allows the viewer to become 'one of the boys'. Goodfellas feels like a party almost, with an occasional ballroom brawl here and there.I'm assuming because of its Oscar snub, that the film wasn't very popular when it was released, but of course brilliance doesn't come right away. It took years for the world to recognize just how groundbreaking Citizen Kane was. No movie is perfect, but Goodfellas is pretty close.",10,1,2,15 May 2010
13 Hours," A better Bay
","13 Hours reminded me a little We Were Soldiers. This is a very literal war movie, a movie about exactly what you see on the screen and seldom anything deeper (like politics). What you see is survival, street-smarts, comradery and a lot of violence. This is no Saving Private Ryan, but it's not a movie of cheep thrills either. What it amounts to is an intelligent action movie. With the exemption of a couple of shots, Michael Bay successfully rises above his pornographic tendencies to make a movie that is 'mostly' unsexy, which is probably the highest compliment anyone can give him. Of course, he has a long way to go to become a good dramatist. The battle sequences are convincing and even immersing (despite the shaky cam), however there were times when it felt like less would have been more. A little less violence and a little more introspective dialog would have certainly made 13 Hours more worthy of a two and a half hour running length. There are moments when you can see John Krasinski and James Badge Dale start to sparkle a bit as actors, but unfortunately the introspective scenes are too few to make characters out of any of these soldiers. Most of the violence takes place at night, and Michael Bay opts for a rather surrealist style of lighting that resembles Dario Argento films. Every second bulb in the frame radiates green light. This is a gorgeously lit movie, perhaps even a little too much so. Michael Bay, being who he his, can help but prefer to show sunlight only in the more romantic golden hours of the day, at dusk and dawn. By contrast, in a film like Hurt Locker, the sun is white hot and blinding, and completely unromantic.I won't deny that it is refreshing to see a Michael Bay movie where an explosion from a rocket impact is not something to dazzle with a fireball but something that is visibly destructive and very real. 13 Hours can be appreciated if you come at it from a right angle.",7,1,5,7 June 2016
The Birds," When terror takes flight with Hitchcock, you can't go wrong
","Every movie fan knows that Alfred Hitchcock is one of the top ten (or even five) geniuses in the history of the movies. I think The Birds is his scariest and most unique picture. Instead of a murder mystery or a psychological thriller, The Birds at its core is essentially a creature feature, and probably one of the most innovative.The premise is sort of a fantasy. It is a completely hypothetical 'What if' story. A small coastal city in sunny California becomes a hellhole when all the local birds suddenly develop a taste for human flesh. Crows, Gulls, sparrows and even fowl all become predators! The story is told from the point of view of a small family and their guest (Tippy Hedron) she has a crush on ... and decides to surprise him by driving into town and giving his sister a present for her birthday.I'll give you a perfect example of just how clever The Birds is. Picture if you will, one bird landing and perching very casually on the monkey bars in a playground, then another lands ten seconds later, then another then another. It resembles something out of Sesame Street (I am count Dracula! lets a-count a-birds!) The next thing you know, there are up to fifty birds just casually sitting on the playground. If you saw that in real life, it would amuse you no doubt. But given the context of the film, you'll either be turned away from the screen or biting your nails off. The visual effects by modern standards would hardly be eye-popping but, considering this was almost fifty years ago, it is a fairly impressive job. There are hand puppets, birds on strings, projector silhouettes, and best of all, the movie features at least a couple hundred real birds. There is an old Hollywood saying, never work with children or animals. Crows and blackbirds are smart fairly easy to train, but seagulls I'm not so sure about, especially for something like the climax. You really need patience to direct a film like this.After three decades in the movie business, Hitchcock has all the skills required to make The Birds come to life. Like all his films, this one has, and will probably continue stand the test of time.",8,3,5,5 August 2009
The Fighter," Packs a pretty good punch
","Without being spectacular, the Fighter throws enough good punches, and provides enough compelling drama (both inside and outside the ring) to be certainly worth a viewing. Sometimes it feels familiar, sometimes it feels fresh. What drives the movie more than anything is the way that the overall performance quality shines through. There is not one underplayed role in the movie. If there is a breakthrough of any sort in the Fighter it would be Christian Bale. One could easily argue that he delivers his best performance yet in the fighter. Personally I'd still give that title to American Psycho, but this one is less likely to be a controversy. Amy Adams breaks some new ground as well, having gone from playing small and frail, to putting on a few pounds, and picking cat fights.The Fighter is a collaborative effort. It doesn't quite break enough new ground to pass for great but, it's a good movie, and a very good boxing movie.",7,2,6,18 December 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," A contrived but usually kick-ass thriller
","Despite a highly unbelievable plot and an anti-climactic finale, Law Abiding Citizen gets you hooked because it has a kick ass edge to it and a small does of cunning and irony to its story, in addition to two slick actors at the top of their game.Clyde Shelton is an engineer and a family man living happily in Philidelphia. One night, his house is broken into, his wife is raped and his daughter killed. A mistake on the part of the justice system results in what Shelton considers to be an insufficient sentence for the two perps. He comes up with a plan to get back at both the killers and the prosecution who he feels didn't do their job. it is a plan ten years in the making, but there will be blood for sure.Law Abiding Citizen does a good job of building not so much suspense but rather energy. As the film builds, it keeps you going, but therein lies a problem as well. With each chapter, the plot gets more contrived and less believable. By the time we reach the climax, the story almost cracks under the weight of its own absurdity. Who would believe that one individual can outsmart an entire city's law enforcement. On top of this the ending has a dumb payoff.The one element which maintains its strength is the duality of Fox and Butler. Their screen time together is solid. This is the film that Fracture could have been if it wasn't so confused in direction and more focused on the people. Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling are no match for these two. All in all, Law Abiding Citizen is not an intelligent movie, and it is certainly not for the squeamish kind, but I enjoyed it.",7,0,0,16 February 2010
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta, D for Disappointing
","Morally aggravating and cinematically direction-less and pretty dull, V for Vendetta strikes me as yet another over rated Hollywood picture which may seem to have something going for it but ultimately does notSet in a totalitarian future in England, (a vision pioneered by legend author George Orwell), the story follows a strange masked individual who dresses like Guy Faukes and is planning a conspiracy to over throw the government. The only person with whom he shares his secrets is a pretty young lady who he rescues from thugs one night and he brings her to his lair. both their lives are suddenly taking a strange turn as mutual feelings for each other start to emerge.Pop culture tends to like stories which attack power, authority or religion, but this one is a bit absurd. It praises one of England's biggest traitors. Guy Faukes was caught trying to blow up the parliament buildings in 1605. This is not however what bothers me most about the film. the real problem is the writing. With the exception of a few moderately neat scenes, most of the film boring, with not much plot progression, and the script includes a lot of silly and pretentious lines which sound clever but arn't. A good example comes after our hero survives a round of gunfire, he says to one of his attackers 'Behind this mask there is an idea, and an idea is bulletproof'. Whatever else V for Vendetta has to offer isn't worth your time. Some bits of charm and wit shine through here and there, but all I really saw was a barren film.",5,31,62,28 August 2009
