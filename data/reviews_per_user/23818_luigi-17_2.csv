The Blair Witch Project," sloppy unappealing attempt at pseudodocumentary
","I am having difficulty understanding the raves this film is gathering.  I watched a preview copy with about 30 persons, all of whom are either filmmakers, film teachers/scholars and artists.  Most people lost interest after 10-15 minutes and began talking or left the room.  The film has a flabby narrative structure, unengaging actors, no suspense and is altogether a sloppy, unappealing attempt at pseudocumentary.  Only one person in the room thought that it might prove popular. Interesting that so many responded differently.",1,2,6,21 April 1999
U-571," Rewatch Das Boot
","Certain images and plot conventions recirculate within film genres, such as the war film and its subgenre(sorry about the pun), the submarine film. However, when a film reproduces identical shots from other sub films (see depth charge attack from Das Boot)it indicates a certain, shall we say, poverty of the imagination.Unlike Das Boot, U-571 plumbs the depths of every bad sub cliche tacked onto a tired Oedipal plot: Young, soft, exec(the inexplicably popular Matthew M) has to step up and prove to surrogate daddy-captain (the wonderful Bill Paxton who dies much too soon) that he is REALLY A MAN. Which he proves by letting men under his command die for their country.On the plus side, it is really loud.So save your hard-earned money and get a good subtitled (not dubbed) copy of Das Boot, the Director's Cut for your weekend warrior viewing.",Null,0,1,24 April 2000
