Source Code," Brilliant adaptation of physics to a novelty!!
","Brilliant movie. The theme of the movie was brilliant! The movie was based for more of the emotional and dramatic part than the fiction or the action! It payed off really well at the end! The film throughout the 90 odd minutes carries a deep story-line about a fallen captain! The novelty here is how they mixed the surprise ending with science fiction to the emotional roller coaster. The movie spends its cinematography mainly in few scenes but they adapt it brilliantly, Again this is not the kind of movie you need your minds wide open when watching, cause that is the biggest mistake you can do when you are watching this film.. But the best thing you can do is to open your heart to the characters and try matching with their thoughts and lines, and see how justifiable they are in their own minds. This movie's little no. of characters summarize the entire society brilliantly. Anybody who is in par with the society will find this! This is so brilliant because of that. Again this deserves 9 stars as this is a whole different experience.. Brilliant!",9,0,1,12 July 2011
