Requiem for a Dream," Amazing and awful at the same time...
","..because the drugs are like this: awesome at the beginning and then turn into something awful! I saw this movie two times so far...fist time I was shocked and amazed about the director of this movie: genial! The second time I realized this movie is not only about drugs (in a pharmaceutical way),is about ALL the things in life that are making you dependent: food,TV,religion,socieaty...about all of them and above all: LOVE! YES, LOVE IS addictive, but in a good way: the love of the mother to the son, the love of two teenagers. etc.Take the DVD version of this movie and be amazed: this is not a movie for everyone, some could might find it gruesome, some would love it and finally some would react like to an overrated movie:)I think this society needs such a movie, so the children would learn something positive from it!Enjoy the show....",10,0,1,18 November 2001

The English Patient," Slow but rewarding, beautiful!
","I have seen many movies, but very few of them managed to create such emotions in the viewer. There are certain movies that makes you feel alive because you FEEL something: sometimes we forget what we are looking for, when we watch a film- we are looking for certain feelings to be created, for certain emotions to surface again. This film is all about this and more. Indeed is a slow paced movie, indeed the characters are not so great, but even the real life is not perfect, so let's put aside all this, and enjoy it with an open minded. Romance is something that appeals a lot to filmmakers, but again, few of them manage to capture it so nice on the screen. The actors were just amazing, the score is captivating and the cinematography reminds of Antonioni. If you are `impatient' this movie is not for you, but all the rest should be able to understand this movie and appreciate it.I watch it 3 times so far, and every time I discover new things that where not there beforeGrab a bottle of nice wine, turn off the light, and let the magic of this movie surround you I give this one 9 of 10.",9,5,9,12 March 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Original!
","I really have to write something about this movie... Original and different from most of today's films, this one manages to capture your attention from the first to the last minute! This is not your typical Jim Carrey movie, so don't go just for Jim...as you might be disappointed. Jim and the rest of the actors are very good, but the screenplay is pure magic: original, touching, inventive, and sometimes even groundbreaking! The director, or anything else did not impress me; this is a pure screenplay-acting film, nothing more...but don't expect some art movie, or cult movie...is still a Hollywood movie. Definitely one of the best movie of this year!",9,0,1,25 March 2004
Identity," ahh..such a waste of time!
","bad acting , bad direction, so so scenario...don't waste your time and money on this one, better get something else!I just cannot believe the high rating on this movie, I can name tons of movies with less ratings and much better artisticrealization!I usually don't spend any time writing comments on this kind of movies, but this time I must say something: don't waste your time!",2,1,5,1 March 2004
