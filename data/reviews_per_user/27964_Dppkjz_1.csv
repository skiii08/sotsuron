The Ring," The best film ever!!!
","The Ring is one of the best films I've ever seen.Just for start, it has a great cast.All of them were wonderful, performed their character very well.Second, the story is very creative and interesting:a videotape that kills you when you watch it.Could it be any scary?I don't think so. Lots of people who saw this movie stayed scared.I think Gore Verbinsky did a great job.He could involve us in every single part of the movie.And I liked 'The Ring' because of that.",10,1,1,28 June 2003
