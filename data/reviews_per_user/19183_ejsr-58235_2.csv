Moneyball," good biopic
",Not a fan of the biographical film usually. Find them too long and boring at times. This one was indeed over the 2-hour mark but didn't feel it. Kept my attention and had me entertained for the duration. Good acting by all and excellent production values. Much more than just a baseball film.,8,1,1,30 December 2019
Reservoir Dogs," best of the nineties
","Plenty of great ones out there for this decade. Plenty from director Quentin Tarantino as well as relented cast and crew. Plenty great one if the same genre. But this one takes first prize for me. It is a great mix of humor, action, thriller, and dramatic tension. Great story here, great acting. Very well done. Leaps and bounds above most of the others I have seen. Everything is done to perfection.",10,0,1,31 December 2019
