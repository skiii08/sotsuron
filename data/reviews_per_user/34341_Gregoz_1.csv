The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," deep artsy film
",I think that this film is one of the best I've seen in the past 10 years. It touches deeply the psychology of a woman who thinks she is not alone in her life. The film is full of symbolism that might be discussed with friends to evaluate if your thoughts are the same as theirs.,8,2,5,20 May 2000
