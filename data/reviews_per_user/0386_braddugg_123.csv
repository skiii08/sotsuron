The King's Speech," Will have a lasting impression but to go till the end, have patience please.
","Just watched it for the second time to understand the screenplay. The first time I did, i had to take a break but now I saw it in one go. The screenplay is simple, it does not have many scenes and is mostly shot interiors with the major part being the confrontations of the King and his speech therapist.OK to begin the review with, the first notice would go to art direction and sets as this is a period film and they are immaculate and beautiful. The performances surely top notch specifically of Geoffrey Rush who acted as speech therapist Lionel but the more tougher one was of the King, played by Colin Firth and he came out with flying colors delivering the act. He stammers so well. The camera work is simple, it remains faithful to the spirit if the film by not providing funky or exuberant angles but providing straight angles. The music direction has to be so much recommended as it brought back the Symphonies alive.But yet, I have not discussed the part that is best about this, it is it's writing, the writing of screenplay and the direction of Tom Hooper who sticks strictly to what it is, The King's speech how he learnt to speak and propagate his voice. Though there is huge history at it's backdrop, be it the world war 2 time of time of great importance to England adding to the death of the earlier king and the heir who was given the thrown, abdicates it and thus the Duke of York as he was named at the beginning, takes over as the King of British.His reluctance is well expressed and so is his anguish, he does not stammer when he sings or shouts and thats what is caught by his teacher and helps him.Having said all that, it's not a movie of history or about speech therapy, it's a simple and well told of how a man overcame his misgiving and fought to stand erect. Though this is a great movie that is so absorbing, I doubt if it is the best one I saw in last year as it had been given numerous awards. Surely, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush deserve acclaim.Rating : 3/5. Will have a lasting impression but to go till the end, have patience please.",6,1,4,20 September 2014
Despicable Me 2," A fine sequel but not as charming as the predecessor.
","A fine sequel but not as charming as the predecessor.Many sequels get lost or get rotten by showing the same thing over again in a new package. The packaging is different but the contents are more or less the same. This film too, follows a similar path just that it deviates to introduce more themes or plots. Like, the sub plot of Gru (played by Steve Carell) and his girlfriend Lucy (played by Kristen Wiig). The villain is new, the gags are new and the action is also new, yet the soul remains unperturbed or changed. So that's a bit of disappointment if you expect something radically different in this. If you loved the earlier one indeed there are higher chances that this one shall also be loved. I am saying this, as actually there are more moments of laughter and fun. The minions, who had a lesser role in the prequel play a big role in holding the film together and helping the hero achieve to win over the villain. I ain't gonna reveal anything more than this, concerned to the plot. Of course, the kids who were there in the earlier film are part of this too. I like it but not to an extent as I liked the first one. Yet, it's watchable and hilarious too. I am going with a 3/5. Yes, it's surely a well done animated film. But for me, I got a feeling of been there and seen that.",6,1,1,7 September 2014
Black Swan," An engrossing tale of an artist's pain, in pursuit of passion.
","An engrossing tale of an artist's pain, in pursuit of passion.Darren Aronofosky is a filmmaker whose films are a real pain to watch. One cannot watch films like Requiem for a Dream or Wrestler or even this film more than once. Even if they do, they must endure a lot of pain and it's a great challenge to be seeing these movies again. If the performer goes through pain, Darren makes it so visible and physical that it's tough for the audience to sit through that. And that's why I respect Darren Aronofosky more than many contemporary directors. One must have a gut to show the pain as it is being shown, also must have the balance not to make it satirical coz it's genuine pain. Darren Aronofosky achieved that in his endeavors thus far and hope so he does that in future.See my review of WRESTLER HERE http://braddugg.blogspot.in/2011/12/wrestler-2008-english.htmlSo that was my appreciation of Darren Aronofosky and his work, now let me talk specifically about this film that's about a Ballad Dancer performer. BLACK SWAN is wicked twin of the WHITE SWAN in the Ballad of SWAN LAKE of the 18th century and the tradition has been continuing since. Now, over and above the form of art, it's the way the art is pursued with enormous passion. It's the passion of an artist and when one is too very engrossed in art, he may have delusions of grandeur and that's what happiness with Nina (Natalie Portman). She starts to see her other side, as she tries to transform herself to a Black Swan and the transformation is in itself so very insightful. There can be symbolism drawn between the the state of mind of the artist and so many things that we have learn thus far. Be it a Fyodor Doestovosky's THE DOUBLE or Roman Polanski's ROSEMARY's BABY or TENANT or David Cronenberg's THE FLY. It's the psyche that delves into delusions and makes her physically tiring and even gruesome as there is blood coming out.That's a really interesting take as she keeps seeing herself in such forms as they as she is too passionate about the transformation. Coming to performances, Natalie Portman as Nina, the white swan and the black swan has given a performance of her lifetime and she certainly deserved to win so many accolades. Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis have complemented Nina well and have given us something that's arty and yet so real.The best part, apart from the subject, the direction, the acting of Portman is the background music by CLint Mansell. It haunts us even after the film is done log ago, though it doesn't have a great longevity as Clint Mansell's other work, Requiem For a Dream, it surely has an impact that can be felt for sometime even after the film.I am going with 4/5 for a movie that resonates the pain of an artist, rather a passionate artist and what one has to go through to accomplish their dream.",Null,0,1,8 September 2014
Frost_Nixon," It's an interview where the president is interviewed for his crimes.
","It's an interview where the president is interviewed for his crimes. Now, this is a kind of movie that made me doze off, it seemed like a character study with a historical background. A man has done something wrong and it's all up to few other people to make him accept the crime or make him guilty. Now, Nixon was the president of USA and he was the only president to have resigned in 1974 for being part of a Watergate scandal. It's a beginning of a fall, and a fall of a president has to be interesting or at least there has to be substantial interest. Ron Howard creates that interest by making this film like a Network kind of film, where media and the impact of media plays a huge role in determining the character of a person. You are what you you say more than you are what you do, this seems to be an undercurrent theme in this media run movie. Acted competently by Michael Sheen as David Frost, the man who interviewed the president Richard Nixon, played by Frank Langella. These two performances are enough to make it go and see it. Having said that, it's their dialogue that has lot many details that make us sit and observe and then they do not help us conclude but rather confuse us what is right and what is wrong. Maybe, the point was to show that we are grey and not black and white, fair enough and if that's the point surely it was well made. Ron Howard as a director seems to be great at such Historical Dramas, be it Apollo 13 or Beautiful Mind or Cinderella Man. This one is no surprise and definitely it's a good film and indeed worth a watch for its screenplay and dialogue and acting more than anything else. The production design was good, the editing could have been better for a near 2 hour film that is all about an interview where lot many details are revealed. It's not a film where we can relate to, it neither one that is entertaining and makes us sit and watch, it's one that is simply made for showing us the brain behind a deed or rather misdeed. A 3/5 for definitely good film but I am sorry coz it did not work for me. Maybe, I am not interested in the politics involved in the film.",6,0,0,8 September 2014
The Sound of Music," Music is certainly divine. It brings order in chaos and peace in life.
","Music is certainly divine. It brings order in chaos and peace in life.Music is what Maria brings into lives of the children of Georg Von Trapp. They in turn become loving, sincere and disciplined kids.This film is certainly about music, the impact of music and how music can be used as a tool of inspiration to children. From the song 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?' to the inspirational 'Do Re Mi' to the title song 'The Sound of Music' and the other wonderful song 'My Favorite Things', these are exceptional songs that are tailor-made to the script and carry the narrative forward. Even the final song 'So Long' is done wonderfully by everyone. Credit to the composers Richard Rogers and his team for this. Also, the director Robert Wise who had a vision and let the songs flow into the narrative fluidly and let the songs speak for the movie, is a wonderful thing.this is certainly one of the great musicals that will be there for as long as movies exist. The well placed nuances, the theme, the characterization blended with the glorious style and the grandeur set in the alps. It makes this a great movie. Yet, I have only one thing against this and it's the plot. The plot is predictable and thus making me lose fun in between the film itself. The climax is pretty simplistic and comes in haste. barring these, the rest is mellifluous and poetic.No wonder why many musicians have loved this film. Even I love this, wish it was more unpredictable. A 4/5 for this.",8,2,9,17 August 2014
Catch Me If You Can," Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.
","Steven Spielberg brings up a rather interesting story but makes it his own slow paced drama that is less interesting than it really is.Inspired by true story of the con man and runaway thief and fraud checker Frank Abagnale Jr. the story is really interesting in terms of how he disguised himself into so many professions, how many flaws are there in the system. How easy it is to become a pilot, doctor and even a lawyer, how worse are background checks in America and how spineless is FBI too. Now, all this was interesting premise and this is indeed a worth telling tale. Yet, Spielberg made this to a heroic tale of a famous man and how even he has a human side where he loves his parents and wants to be faithful to a girl he loved. I didn't want him to be humane, I would have rather loved if he was lethal and brutal than he is actually shown to be. Tom Hanks here tried to make a fool of himself and I did not like it coz, he failed even failed to make a fool of himself and that's really sad, coz Tom is a fine actor and his acting did not show up here. The movie belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio who does a fine job and the now superstar who was still a coming up actor in 2002, did show that he had the potential of making it big and his choices have made his career great. Leonardo as Frank comes with all guns blazing for whatever he is asked to do but I just wish his role was more cold blooded and cunning in despising himself and making merry with what goodies he gets. The art direction seems to be fine, but soundtrack of Jazz caught my ears and that was some real good music and I loved the soundtrack. Now, cinematography is good too, yet this is over two hour two minute saga that loses steam by the end. I wish it had more pace and not as lethargic as it is. The supporting cast did their job well and Amy Adams was a really cute pie then and she has come a long way since then.The writing had been a bit more crisper and the scissors been much more tight would have made this chase a delightful one, in a heist and chase movie, we do not expect drama but this loads of it, the father intervenes and the son-father relationship was not so much to my liking coz it was more of a clichÃ©d thing than a fantasy one. The son keeps saying, dad I do this for you, I do that for you, now you and mom be happy. Ah, just cut the crap man.Oh, did I go too harsh in criticizing this movie, yeah I would have coz this is a great film for few but not for me. For me this was kind of routine stuff from a director who made a distinction to himself of making movies or telling stories that are too very engrossing and make us move, be it a ET, Jurassic park or a Schindler's List. Now, Spielberg got down to this and it was an OK attempt not a great one though.I am going with a 2/5 for an average movie from a great director and two of the very good actors we have around. This is what your bread and butter is, I need your gold and diamonds.",4,2,6,8 September 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," This is an adventure film and perhaps one of the best.
","This is an adventure film and perhaps one of the best.Indiana Jones, the archaeology professor takes us on an adventure and lets us know about things that we never knew. I am not sure if they ever existed but as along as I am on fun ride, I am pretty happy with the fiction element of the ride. And this one is a fun ride and good one too. Having said that, I still can't say if it still has the charm of 1981 (rather I saw it first time in 2002) but as I saw it today, it made a fun ride. Thanks to Harrison Ford for carrying the style and flamboyance needed and to Steven Spielberg and George Lucan and team who made this INDY possible. It's an adventure of 1930's and art direction and cinematography are superb. The music which has now became a signature tune even to film awards in India is gonna stay with us for a long time. Some film makers have claimed this film to be changing their mind and pulling them into films, example Nagesh Kukunoor. So the impact of the film is understandable and yet is extensive. The special effects are nowhere when compared to what we have today, but it was made but what was there in 1981 and boy, I must say it will stand better than many special effects films even 100 years later. The best thing probably is the setup, there is a dialogue initially to help us understand what is the purpose of the adventure and then once the adventure rolls in, we are put aback by thrills and stunts and more than anything, the enigma of a charismatic man called Indiana Jones.I would go with 4/5 and recommend it to all those adventure and fun loving guys. And for all the parents, your kids will love this film more than the recent crap films like JOURNEY or anything. I strongly believe this.",8,2,4,19 September 2014
Casablanca," To begin with a review for what is considered a great movie of all time by many, I would say, 'Play it again, Sam'. The line is in the movie itself.
","To begin with a review for what is considered a great movie of all time by many, I would say, 'Play it again, Sam'. The line is in the movie itself.This movie is revered by many and indeed comes out as a great love story, but in fact apart from few minutes of a montage or a flashback, it never really revealed how they did fall in love, they here is the hero and the heroine. The protagonist, is apparently not a human here but they are the transit papers that drive the whole story and to get hold of them will be each character's will. Played extremely well by all the characters involved, the acting is a text book for many aspiring actors even today and shall be there forever. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund just paints the screen with her eyes, so well captured those eyes are that they made me desire for them and to have a faint touch of those to wipe those tears. This movie shall always be a tribute to her. Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine has done well and what I learnt from him was how to be expressionless and to derive an expressionless face also needs an extremely tough expression.The writing is pretty accurate but the reasoning's are minimal, why a certain character behaves in a way is not completely revealed in the film. It is highly unconventional a love story for 1942 coz, Ilsa is seen kissing Rick many a time as he is the one she loves but is not by Victor Laszlo, the man whom she is married to and the man who loves Ilsa the most. That is an irony and brings an uncertainty to the way characters act. One scene where Ilsa and Rick are in Paris, embracing each other breaks up where they have to part and another scene turns up that Ilsa is manipulating Rick later to escape the country and even then she says that she loves Rick only. That is an inconsistency I observed but nevertheless, the story she reveals to Rick as to whom she was and what has actually happened to her makes up for it. But for today's viewers most scenes may seem like to have been cooked up and not so fluid and even I felt the same, the climax escape which Rick sets up is a bit truly altruistic and actually not very much appreciated by me. If I love a woman, she comes back I would rather stick with her then let her go again. My love is of prime importance to me but here, Rick has other plans so I did not like the climax much had it been the other way portraying a selfish human being as protagonist, surely the movie may not have received this much appreciation.The music is excellent and the one song As Time Goes By is poignant and relevant to the movie narrative and even for normal reference. That is a high point apart from the acting of the film. The cinematography was simple and so are the settings which are mostly shot within studio.So thus, I would say, this movie accounts as a great one by many and is loved by many more and I would love Ingrid play the role again and again too. But writing should have been tight and the characters should have been driven by selfishness rather than selflessness.My Rating 3/5. A good one to watch for sure but not the greatest for me.",6,1,2,20 September 2014
Chinatown," Mesmerizing and mysterious and so authentically made.
","Mesmerizing and mysterious and so authentically made.Its hard not to delve into the script right from the first frame, as the reels goes on, characters become more mysterious, more secrets are revealed and more questions raised, is it about water and the power to hold water or something much beyond that, if that's one question, then why is Jake so interested in things like Evelyn Cross. Jake Gittes is played by Jack Nicholson and he is done an exceptional job and so did so many others, in fact all of them must be applauded for acting. Now for such supreme acting to be extracted, the director takes a toll and here we have Roman Polanski at the helm and its his take on the script thats makes it more dark and interesting. Robert Towne has produced a screenplay thats is superbly written, fast paced for its 140 minutes length and becomes more interesting till the last frame, dialogues are written so well, that they are mystique when we hear and are so self explanatory when it happens in the film. The best dialogue that astonished me is 'She is my sister and my daughter' does anyone expect this all through the film, I very much doubt. The pace holds it up well and is written with enough moments of dark humor, its not sarcastic or finding flaws in system, but finding flaws in person who are a BIG part of the system and are the main drivers of it. So it's psychological more than incident based. I believe, Robert Towne wrote it as incident based screenplay but Roman Polanski who has made even THE PIANIST as an extremely psychological film is who raises above the script and makes it a masterpiece.I will go with 5/5 and a best writing for Robert Towne, best acting for Jack Nicholson and best direction for Roman Polanski are my awards. Just watch it please.Also, I got to know of this film through the equally well adapted Hindi film, 'Manorama Six Feet Under' which is well worth a watch will review that later.",10,1,2,19 September 2014
Gravity," The most immersing cinematic experience since AVATAR.
","The most immersing cinematic experience since AVATAR.Before I begin the review I have a qualm to express. I am appalled by the way Prasads IMAX does it's business. IMAX was built with a specific purpose and now with release of Telugu films which do not deserve an IMAX screen, Prasads expressed that its purpose is to serve Telugu films and the films essentially meant for an IMAX release, like GRAVITY have to take a backseat. I wish there was one show of this film in IMAX.How many do know that there is an IMAX in NASA Space Center in Florida. I was lucky to be at NASA in 2010 and more so as I did see a wonderful film called HUBBLE there. Now, GRAVITY is a film that is based on what may have happened to HUBBLE. That is all it has in common and from then on, its a bumpy ride its a kind of cast away it space. Where one person is caught in jeopardy and has to get out of it. George Clooney as Matt Kowalsky and Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone are two NASA people on board the Hubble on an operation. Now, in space fixing a screw too is like an operation coz its daunting task there, considering many things. In GRAVITY, their characters are wonderfully written by Alfonso Cuaron and both have done their jobs wonderfully and indeed Sandra Bullock has won my heart with her performance. Why is Gravity so immersing is because this is not a film where merely some story is said. It throws you into the action, makes you empathize with the character and makes you relieved when the character attains the impossible. That's how cinema is supposed to be and GRAVITY succeeds in involving the eyes and the physical body language too of the viewer too. I felt dizzy at times and I am still feeling the jolt hours later. Impact is such heavy and also it's all worthwhile.Alfonso Cuaron, who took the pain of directing it must be a relieved man now since he has done the job wonderfully in directing this marvel now can sit back and enjoy the results of the hard work. The pain he took in detailing can be felt in every nuance that is there is on the screen, even the teardrops, the nuts and bolts, wow for all those in space. All my salutations to Alfonso, the writer director who had a vision and he has executed it a way that we seldom see in cinema.I loved the editing and the soundtrack. But above all else, I loved the cinematography and the visual effects. Placing the camera in the right position and to encapsulate the whole feeling in the lens is remarkably done. The post production work I am sure will sweep all the visual effects awards of this year.Above all, it's a story of inspiration and of human spirit winning in hard times. When there is hope and some common sense, 'fortune favors the brave' and that's what exactly happened in GRAVITY.A 5/5 for one of the most compelling experiences at cinema. I wish this film was not given a break by our theater people and I also wish that this will be soon released in IMAX as I am eager to catch it up in IMAX many many times. JUST LOVED THE EXPERIENCE.",10,3,7,7 September 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," This is religious, political, funny satire.
","Few films are funny, few satirical and few religious and a few more political. This is religious, political, funny satire.Set in the backdrop of B.C when Jesus Christ was born and the same day when Brian was born. He says same as Jesus Christ said and is even crucified like Jesus Christ. So we have a whole life of a man who is made a Messiah in completely funny way. The best was when the the Roman king says dialogues where 'R' becomes 'W'. You must listen them and they are utterly hilarious. It's good because it's whimsical, witty and wonderful. There are lot many subtexts that question faith and even our way of following faith, though not mine, but many others. No wonder, if it was accused or even banned by the Christian communities for it's depiction of religion and customs. But, this a whole hearted and fun filled film that would be enjoyable if we leave out our prejudices and beliefs and see it. There are high chances that you ail like it. There are many funny things to begin with, Brian's mother is acted by a man, I felt that funny. The quarrel about a nose, the revelation of being Roman and even the organised crucifixion. Ah, those are not those typical laugh out loud moments but sure there is inherent comedy in them. Technically, this has good production values, good art direction, good costumes, great acting, fine editing and sound design and superb lines. Now, I thank Terry Gilliam for starting Monty Python series and to Terry Jones for directing this film. It's totally stupid and even maniacal and a must watch film.Watch if you like out and out fun films. No brainer this, but long detailed and funny scenes make this a 4/5 movie for me.",8,1,3,17 September 2014
Se7en," Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.
","Calling this film 'Terrific' would still be an understatement.Engaging right from the word go, and shocking at the end, this film is an epitome of writing and shows that if a well-written script is directed well, then everything becomes great. David Fincher was not a great well-known when he was making this. His first film Alien 3 was supposedly panned by most people. Then, he took on directing this cold blooded murder mystery film, and boy he did the job extremely well.The dialogues are extremely important and they have a lot of weight. It's rare to see a thriller filled with such nuances and have a deep meaning to words. The action is minimal and yet has a very high impact. The culmination or finale is a shocker. To say the least, the last 30 minutes are riveting and spine chilling.The nearly 130 minutes film becomes highly action packed after 90 minutes. In the last 40 minutes, actually, there is a lot of dialogue that's very provocative than action. Yet. it's so very engaging that it takes me to the edge of seat each time I see this film thus, I call it as action-packed. I must say, I have seen this film multiple times, with multiple people as my viewing partners, and each time I like it more. So this film just keeps growing on me.The cinematography is amazing and so is the editing. These two departments technically are supreme. Other departments did their job well too. Of all, it's the direction that mattered. Fincher gave us a glimpse what he is capable of with this supreme film, his next one was 'The Fight Club' which is a cult in itself.It's a 5/5 for a great film that surpasses time to stand out as a classic thriller. I have not named the actual supreme character in this film, so go and find out who it is and what he does.",10,2,3,8 September 2016
As Good as It Gets," A film that has its shortcomings yet rises above in performances.
","A film that has its shortcomings yet rises above in performances.Who would be interested in an insane writer, his neighboring painter and a waitress who has a sad marriage. And bring these three up you have As Good As It Gets, a small film that is done so wonderfully by its leads Jack Nicholson as Melvin Udall and Helen Hunt as Carol. It's hard not to fall in love with these characters or their eccentricities and histrionics. Also to mention Greg Kinnear as Simon who does a pretty good job. Now what about the dog Verdell who too has shown good emotions and responded pretty naturally. Now, done with performances appraisal, now lets rip the movie with its further study.Screenplay is lethargic rather placid I must say and its a long drawn out for nearly more than 2 hours to convey a point and to express a feeling. Now, situations had to be fabricated to squeeze such feelings out of the characters and this is where I did not like it, like the road trip to understand each other or the act to have a doctor see Carol's son. These are a few overboard things in which is otherwise a pretty decent film. The direction is not so much there and rather unappreciable in adding up unwanted scenes here and there and making it a bit messy than needed. Now, having said all the above, dialog by Mark Andrus and James L Brooks is outstanding and thats what sets this film engaging though scattered and long. All other departments are just fine and have done their job rather commendably.I give it a 3/5 a good one for sure just and supreme acting and good dialog makes it a worth romantic comedy. I wish our Telugu or even Hindi Films are more subtle and simple like this one.",6,0,2,19 September 2014
Citizen Kane," A masterpiece about a man who is obsessed with himself and his earnings and his pride.
","A masterpiece about a man who is obsessed with himself and his earnings and his pride.It's about a man and his Rosebud, and the rosebud symbolises so much than we can even understand.Citizen Kane is a fictional character mind you, yet is done so realistically by Orson Welles.This was the greatest off beat film in 1941 coz when more films were on war related issues or thrillers this was on a person a megalomaniacal self obsessed and an eccentric character. This was a film made by a man who for the first ever in the Hollywood history was given complete control by studios and asked to make any film he wanted. Orson Welles made this film, a masterpiece. Orson is extremely passionate and has a great visual there are no close ups or no heavy background score yet there is an inherent tension created just with lighting and the expression.Wow, a man who is so near yet so far far far away. It symbolises a lot in this film. Charles Foster Kane walks in his final stages and what has he got is nothing. Just before this shot, he holds a piece and says 'Rosebud' which were his last dying words. The film begins with people trying to know, media trying to know what is Rosebud, the last dying words of Charles Foster Kane.It means so much, it means blossom, it means innocence, it means serenity and all is lost. At the end when Leland says 'All he wanted out of life was love'. And Charles after being whatever he was, has lost it. Its subtly symbolic, technically by far the greatest and characteristically, enigmatic and unforgettable. You just can't have so many good things in one from a first time director, but Orson, the guy made an unmistakable masterpiece that has stood the test of time and even 70 years, it's Blu Ray seems great and the sales speak for themselves what a film this is. A 5/5 for one of my favorite films and intact I have seen it so many times and yet I keep learning so much. This reminds me of one thing 'Character, Character, Character. The characteristics of characters drive the emotion of the cinema, great characters make great cinema'.I still can't get enough of this film. Will revisit this film time and again for sure.Two things, that were technically far more superior than most movies in 1940's was lighting and sound. Cinematography is something where so much can be learnt from this film.",10,1,2,19 September 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Seldom, you will see a War period film that's completely fictionalised and extremely interesting.
","Seldom, you will see a War period film that's completely fictionalised and extremely interesting.It's a film that is in English/FRENCH/German/Italian, but just gave English coz it's directed by an English Director, Quentin Tarantino.War films are mostly dramatic or even melodramatic and in parts boring, coz we know that a War hero either survived a great war, or dies with great glory. But here, Basterds do neither, they live with great glory and kill the enemies (Nazis) including Hitler Just see, how they did that and that makes a great film. Had a girl not got theatre, had there not been any films in 1940's, this film would not have been made.Tarantino the great and a uniquely gifted director brought so many elements in his story telling, that it's not easy to simply put a finger one thing and say 'I liked this one more than the other' Performances by the whole ensemble cast is super. Christoph Waltz shines as the cold blooded 'Jew Hunter' Hans Landa. Brad Pitt does Aldo Raine with a niche that his his own, be it uttering American accent or killing Nazis with guns. Melanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus is vulnerable and shrewd. All others, just right for their roles. So casting director and Quentin Tarantino pulled off a great cast and all did extremely well.The cinematography, art direction, production design and even the sound, the music, be it Ennio Morricone's touch of 'Fur Elise' or Dmitri Tiomkins 'Green Leaves of Summer' or David Bowie's 'Gasoline'. Wow, what a sound all that was apart from the heavy explosions and Hitler's 'Nai, nai, nai, nai, nai' squeals. So to put it simply its is technically brilliant and dramatically terrific.Now, let me get to Quentin Tarantino, this man has given us a film like Pulp Fiction that is in any sense cannot be considered less than the most influential film in last 20 years. Now, with Inglourious, he took the writing to a very new level, where anything can be done, said, preached, and even followed. So just do what we believe and make it interesting, something that you as audience would love to see and it will work. Inglourious is a prime example of that.The writing is so very exemplary here that the script itself is enough to be read many times, lot many characters, few plots all gathering for one big climax. Too much of happening in too little, and yet we have to figure what happens when. It's based in Chapter based narration and that too non-linear, so it's a kind of puzzle where we must figure out what happens when.I am not sure how many times, I would have watched it in last 2-3 years, but each time I learn a new thing, a new dialogue, a new camera angle, a new emotion and I still can't get enough of this. But 2 and half hour now started to seem so much longer than it originally was. So, cutting this down to 4/5, a great movie and a must watch movie for all the movie lovers. Post Pulp Fiction, I rate this as best movie of Tarantino. Though this is inspired hugely from the 1978 film 'The Inglorious Bastards', I still love this version.A 4/5 movie, that is just great in every way except the length.",8,0,0,8 September 2014
Coraline," Fantastic fantasy, just that we have had such journeys in cinema long while ago.
","Fantastic fantasy, just that we have had such journeys in cinema long while ago.From an Alice in Wonderland to many fairy tales, we have seen a girl jump into a fantasy world and explore it. The same happens with CORALINE, just that she says people as how she wants them to be. Having said that, this is by no measure bad cinema ad in fact it's interesting too. Just we need to be patient.The whole animation is done like the ones we used to see in our childhood and those were puppets used in stop-motion cinema, so we have wooden made faces here and not the standard animation. Well, the design and the look is not so appealing or to say the least gorgeous as it is old fashioned. Yet, a few aficionados of those good old times may like this.The cinematography is good and at times is just awesome in terms of the way we are revealed those things what Coraline sees in her adventure. The costumes too are well suited too, to make it look a but creepy and something that we are certainly willing to know. Above all, acting and the concept is one thing that ail make it a watch, if all else is something that we are not much interested in. Dialogues are just there as if we speak lines naturally and at times out of place too, so much praise to writing here.So that's mostly about it, a good animated film that is not a must watch but not a must miss either. Leaving it with a 3/5. Good.",6,0,0,19 September 2014
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," At times, even crap seems to be fine.
","At times, even crap seems to be fine. As my friend Raghuveer just said, 'no film is a bad film if our faculties are laid to rest'. This is not a bad film either, just that we have rest our faculties. I was reluctant halfway through the film to complete this, yet I did make it to the end, coz I just wanted to see a light hearted comedy after watching those big great films. Now, even this mind needs some rest and this film gave me the much needed respite.In many terms, if I look at this from a critical perspective it is very average, be it dialogue acting or the whole theme of getting to a girlfriend, we saw this in When Harry Met Sally, and so many other films just that here, we have a different backdrop. Sarah is a TV actor and the guy Peter is trying hard to forgetting his ex girlfriend Sarah Marshall. So most of things happen for our peace here, he gets a place to stay, falls in love with a different woman, and sticks on to her. And even before this, he tries one night stands. All is so easy in this guys life it seems. So that's how easily this movie was made and yet it was made likable. May be Hawaii, the backdrop of this movie was got me into it more than anything else. And this film displays may romantic traditions of Hawaii and I loved them.Thanks guys, for making an average movie as this, coz at times, we need average stuff to find our self back. You helped me do that again. Giving you a 2/5 for the technical aspects which are certainly above average, just that I have seen such films so many.",4,2,4,19 September 2014
Rang De Basanti," One of the finest movie of this generation. It's not a movie, it's a movement.
","One of the finest movie of this generation. It's not a movie, it's a movement.We were 13-14 friends who went to see this in Shiva theatre (dilsukhnagar, hyderabad) on Jan 26th 2006. It was Kranthi, Rutwik, Venkat, Raghuveer, Manthan, Anirudh, Dinackar, Satish among those whom I can recollect. Now, the film began rolling, Kranthi who was next to me said, what movie have we come to, there is Bhagat Singh reading his diary and it was a sepia shot. Before, this I got the CD and was is love with the music of the film, I thought it would be youthful, dreamy and completely joyful. The title too seemed be inapt when I just heard the music. Then the film began on its course and as the watch fell and titles began to roll, we got a glimpse of what we were about to witness in the titles itself. I must say, till this date I have liked no other titles as this one and the background music by A R Rahman, he put al his genius into it. We were all happy then itself. We got into characters, there was Aslam, DJ, Karan, Sukhi Ram, Laxman Pandey and Ajay and also Sue (Su Kar Mere Mann Ko) all the right chords were touched in casting and we also had the legendray Waheeda Rehman play Ajay's mother and other good actors in the roles of mothers and fathers. The story was about Su coming to India to make a film on our lost and forgotten freedom fighters. Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and others. It was paced as if we are told the whole revoultionary story in the most enaging way possible. Indeed, that is the only way we relate to this, there is a need for freedom in one way, at least the Gandhian way is not working now so let's try the Bhagat Singh way. We may die but yet we shall die happily. If there is any film that has made me believe in myself more and to fight for what I believe is right, then this is the film. What DJ stood for what he believed in though he could not believe it in the first place. Laxman is a symbol of the uncorrupt youth who are being dragged into partisan politics and being corrupted. Karan is the cool dude who worries about rich gear and not about this country much. Aslam is the poet who has a big heart and a brave vision. I loved them all and thanks to the writer director Rakesh Mehra for bringing them on all alive, not just as friends but as the freedom fighters whom I wish not to forget. Revolution is what I strived for since I saw this, and most of it is exhibited in the office job where I am a warrior of nothing but honesty and truth. I love them both (truth and honesty) and this film did show that to me. Getting back to the movie, so by the time we were at interval. None of us moved no one grabbed a drink or popcorn, we were in love with what we saying but were thinking and talking where this is going to lead. Raghu said 'Cinematography super' Rutwik said 'I like Karan' the film began post interval and all were glued again. When a tragedy struck and when Lukka Chuppi played, I was having tears and just could not imagine that such a beautiful song was written for such great tragedy. A mother has lost her son and Lukka Chuppi is what it is, hide and seek. I feel numbness in my fingers even as I type this now, then we got Khoon Chala, now the time has come to overpower all our politicians, and these guys just tried to do that at the end and what a tragedy has struck them. They became martyrs. The movie ended, we were struck to our seats, Venkat said, now let's leave. We started walking slowly and got onto our bikes and went to Raghuveer's home. From the time we left the theatre till we reached his home and sit in his room, there was silence, I don't' know why and we were all silent I am sure. Raghu said 'You need something' and our silence broke. This is how vividly I can imagine the whole experience of Jan 26th 006. I just can't forget that. This movie did lot many things to us on that day at least I am sure and I believe most of us still have this feeling at the back of their mind. I just am so thankful for the makers, the actors and very crew man of this wonderful movie. I can't even rate this, but a 5/5 for what it did. Even 6 years later all is very fresh and am still hopeful of doing something. This was the first DVD I bought for myself and am happy that I did. I just can't let go of this movie. It may not the best in cinematic terms maybe as I have heard a mixed opinion down the years, but the screenplay is just awesome and so the background score and cinematography. The songs, the emotion, the poetry. Go watch all of it and I am sure, most of you will love it again.I am sorry if this became more of an autobiography than a movie review, but just wanted to share it.",10,2,6,19 September 2014
Argo," A well made film that thrives on strategy, and luck and a bit of calmness and composure.
","A well made film that thrives on strategy, and luck and a bit of calmness and composure.Sure, Ben Affleck has come a long way from a Good Will Hunting Script to this film named ARGO. Don't ask me why was it named ARGO, and why the caption reads, the movie is fake, the mission is real. If you want to know better see the film. There are a few things I liked and a few things I disliked about this. The things I liked are the production design of setting up a 1970's troubled Iran and making us believe how real the whole film was, it showed a great depiction of the Iran Hostage crisis. The sound was great too. The performances by almost everyone were great and I loved John Goodman and above all Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez. Now, this is a real story so we are bound and handcuffed not to disagree with a few things, like how come a sudden idea sprung up to Tony and how is it approved by CIA. It happened and so we see. All, in all, I liked the sound, production, casting and acting.Now the things I disliked was creation of a forced drama in the climax where they are caught then relieved again a fact comes to the rebels notice and they rush to stop the plane. I did not think that cinematically, it was so very needed we do not have to make a climax out of nothing. In reality, a call would have stopped the plane from take off. So this is where the director Ben Affleck needs to improve, yes undoubtedly he made a good film but if he wants to be more real and less cinematic, he needs to take out a few formulaic things. The direction has indeed faltered in few places like factually, 1950's depiction of the speeches, but I did give in to all the factual faults just that it was a bit more simpler and bit more restrained. Even the rushing up of getting an idea of making a film and getting an approval was not to my complete liking, had that been more restraint and more thought of, I would have loved that. By far, this comes as one of the better movies of the year and what it got is an Oscar, not sure if that actually deserved coz I like Amour more than any other film of last year as I saw till now. But surely, barring Amour, this may have been the best bet with what it had, it had a realistic appeal like that of Hurt Locker, an entertaining element like that of a King's Speech, where our hero is relieved from what he has achieved. So it's good good and good but I am not sure if it's a great film, I have so many questions in my own tiny mind that keep getting back and asking me, is this the movie of the year and the answer I got after watching this not once, but twice is that 'I don't think so, there are better movies than this for sure' But who needs my likes and dislikes, the majority rules this world and since the majority feels that this is the best movie for them, this won the accolades all over. Mind you, this a thrilling documentary nevertheless and if you see it as a documentary film, then this is as fine as it gets, but as a dramatic film, it falls shirt a bit only.Ben, sure boy you did a great job, but I wanna see you in a better director's hat than this one. I am going with 3/5 for a sure good film but I better hope for a better film next time from this director.",6,1,2,8 September 2014
12 Angry Men," Life is not something to be decided in five minutes. Let's talk about it.
","Life is not something to be decided in five minutes. Let's talk about it.Well, the most important movie in terms of format and and in fact the best movie it terms of dialogue. This movie is completely unconventional in format and it's setting. 12 men discuss a case in a room, weird for a movie isn't it. How long can you sustain drama with a case, that's the point. Extremely well written and well acted, this is in fact a testimony of writing. All films have to be driven by writing more than anything else. Simply shot, the dialogue makes up for everything here. There are many things that could have been shown like it happens in other courtroom dramas, that is I mean the whole trial, the evidences, the arguments. But here, the trial is over only the judgment of the jury is pending which is 11-1 from the word go and in all expectation should have been 12-0 in favor of guilty. Now, that does not make a good character of the man who stood out. That 1 man has to influence all the 11 others to become an outstanding man from a mere standing out person. And that is what exactly happens. Good, in every which way you consider. If you see it once, and I am sure if you watched it once, you will mostly be convinced by my argument it's the most Simply made movie that is great in all aspects. Henry Fonda, must be appreciated a lot for producing this and giving the job of direction to Sidney Lumet as his first movie. Greatly written by Reginald Rose as a play and then for the movie. All the greatness pertaining to this movie should be credited to the mentioned three names. Thanks for everyone who was a part of this film and made it what it is today. This is one of the most important films of my life as it triggered a thought of why don't I make a movie set in a room and that's just live talk. Oh yes, I waited for the longest time to get a Blu ray of this, and was very happy again with the quality., blu-ray just rocks and thanks for the transformation.It's 5/5 for a movie that has stood the test of time and will be as great as ever even many years later.",10,1,2,20 September 2014
Billy Elliot," A good film that is dramatized a lot.
","A good film that is dramatized a lot.Look at the scene in which Billy gets a call from school, and he leans back in the chair relieved with a sigh and there is a dramatic score that plays in the background, we all know that he is going to make it, at least I knew he is going to make it but I do not think it need to be that dramatized. So barring the melodrama this is a good movie in parts and touches a few right chords, like Billy's emphatic exhibition of Ballet to get a school admission or his dad saying 'he is just 11 years old, lets give him a chance' these made me feel nevertheless but yet those moments were just not enough yet. Jamie Bell at his age, gave a supreme performance and it's a real tough thing for a 12 year boy to learn and perform ballet. Perhaps thats one of the reasons more than anything that this movie got a wide recognition. The script is good and so is the cinematography yet, there is something that makes the movie fall, and it is the editing. Remove the dramatic pieces and cut it down by 15 minutes, this wold have been a great film. Yet, the way it is, it is just good. Also, the music could have been toned down a bit to make the whole thing realThis film can be termed as a good self help movie as it helps us understand that if we have passion in something, mostly things fall in place and help us to pursue the passion. At least, that's what happened with Billy Elliot. Also a mention of Julie Walters as Mrs. Wilkinson, she was good each time and great few times.Overall, a good film yet not a recommended one. A 3/5 only for this.",6,0,1,8 September 2014
127 Hours," I am surprised that I did not yet write a review of this film that is true honest and uncompromising.
","I am surprised that I did not yet write a review of this film that is true honest and uncompromising.It's a bore, un engaging, we saw this many times, yeah he is triumphant but we lost our time. These were the words I heard most from those who saw it coz that's not what it is for me.It is one of the honest stories I have seen all through last year and even as I saw it now, I could not hold myself from scratching my cheeks hard when the amputation scene came. It's one of the best voyages undertook and our hero Aron has not actually won it but he had to lose something to win life. And that something is priceless.Aron is an adventurer who frequently ventures into the national parks of UTAH(that's one state of USA I missed last visit and in fact the state that has most national parks.) UTAH is known for it's very Red Indian life style, it's very lively people. But here, most of the movie is shot in canyon, the whole movie is shot in landscapes and specifically only one cliff in the Blue John Canyon.The way it is shot is so very thrilling that I got everything for minuscule to a macro, just by camera movement. The camera is everywhere, coz we get to know of the tape moving in the video recorder and the drops sprinkling inside the water bottle. Man, the camera work is a lesson to learn and will let us know how to make a simple movie interesting with such great work. Also, the shot has to be placed perfectly placed so I credit the editor for this for he had a very sharp scissor.Major Credit must be given to James Franco who played the role of the real life star Aron Ralston. The scene in which Aron reaches for the sun light when he is stuck is so terrific and the emotions are so very well portrayed. I can see the pain and the joy at once.Now, this is one of the very best Blu-rays I have and it's because all the landscapes, the slot canyons, the water jumps, the background music are made so terrific by two things. 1) Cinematography 2) Audiography. Now, Danny Boyle who perceived this film and made it with conviction has to be praised for bringing out a triumphant story and triumph is actually what we crave for in every story we watch. If the whole of the movie did anything, it just touched me and moved me. Thank you Danny for bringing to light a story worth telling yet again to screen. Thank you very much.It's 4/5 for a movie that's a must watch without a pause or a break.",8,0,0,20 September 2014
Dead Poets Society," One of the finest films. It is inspiring and needs to be seen just for sheer writing.
","One of the finest films. It is inspiring and needs to be seen just for sheer writing. Well written and wonderfully acted, this film does that something, which many films on teenagers fail to do. It inspires us to go out and live a life. To LIVE is a great deed for a teenager who will be missing out on life, in the run for the rot. The rot includes fulfilling aspirations of parents which are way different from his own, it include running for the marks and grades, it includes missing out on fun which we are supposed to have as teenagers, it essentially includes that we do not identify our dream and shall be living others dreams. Teenagers or adolescents do not know what they want to be in many cases, they figure that out as they grow. This can be because of influence by friends or by the college teachers or even an idea he just got or maybe a talent which he would have recognized just then. But before realizing that, they are pushed in many cases by parents into a corner and the parents squeeze what they want them to be. It is a failure and many teenagers succumb to this pressure and even give up life. The more than half, ordinary guys follow the aspirations of their parents which they believe is good for them. Because of the more or less universal thought that 'Parents think for the good of their kids'. Though in many cases it is true, it is a big lie in few cases.I take my life as an example, I wanted to do arts, but I was pushed into engineering. Now, I am not a good artist nor a considerable engineer. I am bad at both and I attribute the failure of this, to the choice done by my elders, who have not tried to figure out my aspirations and simply let me be what I want to be. Such, is the life of Neil Perry (played by Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor, while his father does not want him to be that.Acted wonderfully by Robin Williams, who plays the part of John Keating this film speaks volumes of how good an actor Robin is. His eyes and his mere sigh do tell a lot, which so many histrionics could not have said. This is a very controlled performance by Robin, and in this film and 'Good Will Hunting' I rate his acting as his best ever till date.But the best part is not Robin Williams here, it is Peter Weir the director, who makes the scenes so personal and they can be related to many teenagers. We had fantasies in our teens, we wanted to be something big and something different, we wanted to acquire talents that will take us forward in our lives. So it is very easy to relate to any teenager or an adult who seems to have missed his teens.The another best or great part if Tom Schulman, who wrote the screenplay, giving us the wonderful lines and scenes that shall be etched in our memory long after we have watched it. this is one of the few films, I fall back on when I look for some inspiration, it essentially helps us write.Like in one scene, Robin Williams gives his students an Onion and asks them to see if they can write a poem on that. Damn, good it is.I am going with 5/5, this is wonderful and I like it, in fact Love it. My favorite dialog is the most famous line of Robin 'Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinary'",10,3,4,12 August 2014
Midnight in Paris," Travelling on streets is good but travelling in time is marvelous.
","Travelling on streets is good but travelling in time is marvelous.I have heard of time travel in the film Shining but saw it happen one time after another in this film. Aptly titled, this film is about the mysterious life in Paris that revels in nostalgia. It still has the fragrance of those great artists that adored this great city from a Picasso to Hemingway to so many.Now there is our protagonist Gil Pender who loves the 1920's and very fluidly travels to 1920 and makes connections with the artists. Actually, there is not much of a story, but everything pops up in between, there is an artistis desire, there is infidelity there is an envy about another man and there is love for multiple woman. But all of that said, it's a journey of an artist.Oh, did I mention that this is a Woody Allen film, yes it is and its very Allenish. Now there can't be a movie without Allen so our hero Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is the Allen of the film who is very subconsciously driven and speaks out long sentences that make little meaning to others (but I could make out what he meant). He dreams, and when he realizes he seems so very lost, he does not know what to do and again gets lost. He just knows, he wants to stay in Paris. His every move evokes love for the great city.The art direction if anything is superficial and I envy every bit of it coz the Hollywood for every story have superb technicians and the way they use technology is simply superb. The cinematography is simple for few scenes like a chat between the characters and terrific when it has to bring Paris alive. Yes, certainly Paris is a character of the movie and right in the first few frames I realized this and in fact those first shots were the best of the movie in terms of showing Paris. Did I tell there is infidelity as common theme as in an Allen movie.All through, I can see Allen and his hope for bringing out yet another film that says Art for Art's sake and he succeeds yet again and he cannot fail coz there is a protagonist so strong in him that we can vie for and woo for. We surely want him to simply follow his dreams.It's a charming and an enchanting film nevertheless but it's not a story that we shall for long remember I believe. It did not engage me much in terms of screenplay or characterization to say so except for the enticement caused by the camera.Hail Allen, I give it 3/5. A good one to go for sure.",6,0,0,20 September 2014
The Prestige," Sleight of hand, comes in terms of writing by the screenplay of this.
","Sleight of hand, comes in terms of writing by the screenplay of this. The dexterous Christopher Nolan has mad a movie on Magic and he reveals how intricately and deceptively can a movie on Magic be made. With so many intercuts, mis-en-scenes, it's tough to grasp the pace and understand reason behind everything till the very end. The intrigue builds up with each passing scene but Alas, it falls flat in the end. The only thing I did not like is the last 2 minutes when so much revelation is done is so less time. For the rest of the time, its stupendously outstanding.The cast has done a prime job, especially Christian Bale. Hugh Jackman and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson have played their parts convincingly well. I cannot name the characters here, as Bale and Jackman play multiple characters in the film and it's tough for me to putting them and taking away the intrigue and mystery. Scarlett Johansson plays Olivia Wenscombe and adapts to it extremely well. The art direction is one that is extremely commendable and needs more than a thought, the setup entirely needed vision and the director Nolan had all that and more. The music is extremely situational and wonderful as it does not interrupt the narrative and still holds a place in the memory of the viewer. Mind you, this is not a film to watch for fun, it needs some brains to decipher this, to contemplate this and to get this into our head. So the prime most thing it demands is attention and some concentration, you give them to the film, it rewards you overwhelmingly and that's a great thing for a film. The cinematography is wonderful, some long shots at Tesla's place are really wonderful. The dark and intriguing atmosphere is well built up. Kudos to the cameraman Wally Pfister. It's a wonderful film and indeed one of the best film made on magicians. Having said that, it's a must that we have our brains intact while watching this. A 4/5 for this.",8,0,0,7 September 2014
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," An espionage film that is gripping for sure, but might not work for everyone.
","An espionage film that is gripping for sure, but might not work for everyone.Now, here is an espionage (spying) film that is based on the cold war spies of 1970's. Based on the novel of the same name by John Le Carre, this film has a great screenplay that I must say is great as a screenplay but it's very technical at the same time. This film begins with mole in the circus, now what is mole and what is circus here, to get that itself, I had to sit through the whole film and well, it was not such a pleasant revelation either. Well, in this very film we have actors such as Colin Firth, Tom Hardy and the Sherlock guy Benedict Cumberbatch along with Gary Oldman at the helm. So we have got the best ensemble cast in recent years for a movie. About their performances, everyone does it with such rare understanding of their roles that even I as audience was astonished as to how was that emotion conveyed, when we have not known much of him yet. The production design is awesome and so is the art direction, above all I liked the background music and the sound design, wow kudos to those guys, and cinematography was right in every place as the scenes are well composed. The performances keep you glued, the direction is great and the whole look is great I must say. Yet, there is something that is missing, there is something that is just not right, I can attribute that to editing as I do for other movies, but for this I can't say even that coz all those details are absolutely necessary to conclude the story. So the missing element is the story in itself, it's a story that's specific to an age, to an incident and it's not very universal either, Despite that, it's an intense brain exercise that may even make you watch multiple times just to understand it. There is very little action, rather mostly words and dialogues that are tough to decipher. For me, I had no knowledge of such spies and this story and it came as a bouncer in the first viewing, I took the help of few links and then a second watch made me admire this. So for all the guys who are interested in the cold blooded, spy films this may be it, for others, they may of may not like it. This is a test for patience and fizzles out soon if one is not aware or admiring such stories. But if you know or even have a faint ide of what this film is about, you may fall in love with it. Now, thanks to wikipedia that helped me learn a good deal about this movie.So, I can appreciate this movie yet I may not just recommend for everyone. So, a 4/5 for a good movie that's great in it's own way but needed a prologue and epilogue to help a layman understand.",8,1,3,19 September 2014
The Adventures of Tintin," What a fun, what a ride and alas it ended so very quickly.
","What a fun, what a ride and alas it ended so very quickly.Mind you, this is a Steven Spielberg film and he worked with Peter Jackson in production design. So this film has to be great or at the worst level good, and it indeed is great for me. No drama, no romance, rather no girl in the whole film actually. It's a straight adventure that is reminiscent of Indiana Jones in many ways. I remember collecting TINTIN pages from the weekly magazine THE WEEK and making it into episodes. Alas, I lost those pages but I found him back again with this movie. Every frame is picture perfect and is very well crafted. Be it the first scene of the look of ship through mirror or last scene of finding the treasure, every frame is top quality. With production budget that this film has and the brains that worked for the film, the minimum expectation is awesomeness in every scene and then it has to rise above the script to be called as a great movie. Now, if the first 15 minutes sounded bore then this film is not for you coz that was just the build up and basis for what lies ahead.Once Haddock enters, he takes the film head on and makes it an adventure worth more than our money and time. Haddock, the captain who has a very typical accent came out in the best form and better than what I ever imagined. Best lines of the movie were by Haddock while the reactions for them by Tintin were mostly innocent and at times hilarious. Though it's a great watch, I still cannot say it's a must watch for all those unaware of existence of tintin and you need to be really patient for great moments on screen to happen.Best aspect was animation and yes, it is the best animated movie I saw all this year and this may well receive the best animated film Oscar. I also loved the way camera moved and the way and the way sets were designed.The best scene in a Bike feat, the way Tintin hung to the wire just on handles, awesome. I loved it a lot and it was a laughter riot in theatre.I would go with 4/5 for Tintin, this movie has to be watched for Haddock more than Tintin.",8,0,0,20 September 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A historically important film on male bonding.
","A historically important film on male bonding. This is one of the first Western Films where male bonding was glorified, though there were others earlier than this, I believe this movie got two men together who were bonded thick and thin. The chemistry between Butch Cassidy played by Paul Newman and the Sundance Kid played by Robert Redford is amazing. Without the chemistry, I am sure the film would not have worked and would not have stood the test of time.I am watching it now after a couple of earlier viewings and today too, I felt the bonding of these guys so enticing and charming. The climax where the cover and run are done, is a testimony of what they stand for. Now having said that, the film is not all too good, sweet and nice, there are some sour moments (if not bitter) and they are given to us by uncalled for heists, and a bit of drama to get the girl too. Katherine Ross plays the female character of Etta Place. Though she does here role well, she acts as a kind of spoilsport between our two heroes and it kind of irked me. I saw it as an uncalled for aberration in another wise wonderful film. I liked the cinematography, the color correction, the art direction and even the writing for a good part of the time. The sepia toning done as part of cool correction is wonderful too. It gave an authentic, earthy feeling which is essential for the film. Now, the editing I wish could have been crisp. There is a fight in the beginning that's witty and charm and as the film spans it's length the charm fades and that's the sad part of the film. I wish it would have had more witty moments than it actually did, the second half or later hour felt monotonous too. So, I am OK with what I got and wish it could have been so much better. I am going with 4/5 for this film, just for the sheer repeat value it has got for me that I felt low, so I need a friendship film, I get to this and I got back to this film third time.

","A movie that's insanely satirical and extremely poignant even 50 years after it's making.Wow, firstly mention of the great genius Stanley Kubrick who perceived this film like no one has including the writer of RED ALERT, the novel on which the movie is based on. He created a character of Dr. Strangelove that is not there originally in the book and took it to a level that only Kubrick can be attributed the credit.Now, this is a war movie with a part of war being shown in reality and in fact the whole war crew terminology is shown in heavy detail especially by those in that warplane who communicate mostly in numbers. So even how they speak is made fun at. Having said that, this movie has a serious undertone which I believe was kept aside to ensure that this was comical more than being serious. The tone is a threat of the cold war and what if USA and Russia come to war, it would be a loss of whole humanity itself. Now, this is taken on it's own by Peter Sellers, one of the best comedians who has held the silver screen post the Chaplin-era and he plays not just one, but three principal characters all of them, extremely different in terms of looks, accents, roles and even the way they walk. Now, to take it up as a challenge and to bring in subtleties and portray them as they are is something that only Peter Sellers could have pulled off. Oh, what a great cast this was by using Peter Sellers for 3 roles. The whole set design is just authentic and so is that airplane cockpit design that has too many details to make us feel even silly to be listening to pilots slang. It was all intentionally done by Kubrick and yes it was a laughter ride all through, even when explosion took place. It's stupendous in all departments and thanks to Stanley Kubrick, the master for giving us a film as great as this. It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest satirical war movies that how many ever satires can come on war, this will hold it's own place and way above from others.",10,2,4,19 September 2014
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist that is all - Oscar Wilde
","To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist that is all - Oscar WildeMilkha Singh lives and he truly lived against all the odds. Salute. Please, go watch this film and then judge it.I always believe that sportsmen and artists are the ones, who truly live. They have a purpose to do something. All others, merely exist. Now existence means, since we are born, and have to do something we just exist till death and then die someday and nobody except the family and friends remember us. While sportsmen and artists, live even after death and that's the kind of life, we must aspire for. Now, this film raised some very pertinent questions, do we Indians, love sport? When was the last film based on a true sports person and how many are made? Do we know sportsmen apart from the cricketers, who take part in Olympics? How many who are reading this, know Milkha Singh?India is in a sorry state in Sports and except few folks, no one is passionate or serious about sports in our country. A country of 120 Crores does not have 120 medals from last 120 years. Such is the state of the nation in sport, just very sad. OK, now coming to the movie. I just loved it, and it was flawless for me. Yes, there are evident flaws, but all were surpassed by supreme performance of one man, Farhan Akhtar and his commitment to the role shall win him sublime acclaim. Though all other performances were good. Divya Dutta excelled as Milkha's sister and brought tears to my eyes. The cinematography was superb, the color toning used, the way the races were shot, wow it was just exemplary for me. The songs, so apt to situations, I would have still been happy with couple of songs less, but it's okay. The editing would have been better considering this movie is 3 hours but never did I feel all along that this was so very long. In fact I cherished every moment of it. I cherished it because of the honesty of purpose, it's one of the most purposeful true story that has come out in a long time in our country. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and Prasoon Joshi have done an exemplary job in executing a story that's nothing short of an epic. That take away is this this 'Hard Work, Will Power and Dedication, for a man with these qualities, sky is the limit' It's a 5/5 for this, nothing less. I just loved it. Mr Farhan Akhtar, I loved you as director, then as an actor, then as a singer and then as a TV host too. Now, I love you as Milkha. You are a prime example of a man who knows his strengths and his limitations. But when stop doing the stupid ads of Intex and Tata Motors, you will be fine. You are the man who gave us 'Lakshya' and Dil Chahta Hai' just don't desecrate by becoming less. I still see you as a sanctified being.",10,0,0,7 September 2014
Taxi Driver," A great psychological film from a master director called Martin Scorsese.
","A great psychological film from a master director called Martin Scorsese.It's difficult to say who is greater , if it is Robert De Niro as Travis or Martin Scorsese who made the Travis. I'd give in to the argument and come to terms with diplomacy and say both are great but personally, I love Martin more than Robert. Robert sure is a great actor but the way the whole film is handled by Martin is one thing that made a fine beginning for a man, who gave us very very significant films in his career.Lot goes on in creating an atmosphere that makes us delve into the film as audience and lot more goes into such writing and detailing. Right, from making the room like that of a reckless taxi driver to the setting up of a brothel room the environment is such dream like that it seems like to be a place we see at times in reality and at time in our dreams. Salutations to the Art Director, Cinematographer and the Director who have envisioned such ambiance and resented the same. The writing.. the screenplay is one that on the face is simple is simple, like Travis (Robert De Niro) preparing for a shoot meticulously and a few shots of holding gun and looking himself in mirror and all will make that. But the execution and enacting the writing is what makes this film special. It's not an easy thing to direct psychological films and that's the very reason I respect guys like Welles, Polanski, Hitchcock and Scorsese above many. The music score also helps a great deal and thanks to Bernard Hermann to have given such a score that is jazzy, psychedelic and at times creepy too. OK, now to Robert De NIro, he would have got all the best actor awards, had there not been a 'Network' coz he carried the character Travis Bickle with such ease on his shoulders that I had felt the same pain as he did, when he is rejected by a girl. Thus, all through he made me empathise with him and took me into his mood, his reason of doing a certain thing. I just gave into Niro's character I must say. When the last time I saw in 2006 post my engineering days, I could not see any Indian actor but now I see Ranbir Kapoor can replicate a Taxi Driver as he has got in him everything. But I hope, this film is not remade ever and even if it does, it has to be someone like Anurag Kashyap directing Ranbir Kapoor. A 4/5 for a great film and very important film that has defined psychological films, and indeed was the arrival of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro.",8,0,0,8 September 2014
Shutter Island," It was one hell of a shattering film for me.
","It was one hell of a shattering film for me.Definitely well written and well made, above all it was supremely acted. The poise by Ben Kingsley, the vulnerability by Leonardo DiCaprio and fitting into the characters by all others. It was a job well done by all.It dealt with a lot of psychological elements and effects without bloating or being preachy. Right from the word go, we have an action-packed film in words. Though there is no physical violence, there is a lot of psychological violence. The content of drama is terrific I felt. The film is surely 140 minutes but for me most of it is justified and I did not find anything that was out of place or was deliberately added. So editing takes a bow for keeping the content that is just as required.The master director Martin Scorcese comes with a terrific thriller and he seems to have done away with those gangster films, he made earlier. from 'Taxi Driver' to 'The Departed' there were always many dark shades to characters in his films and this film is no exception. The darkest character in this film was the protagonist himself like it was in 'Taxi Driver'.Some of the appreciation must go to the original novel writer Dennis Lehane for writing the novel 'Shutter Island'. This would have surely been an unputdownable book.There are hallucinations, metaphors, dreams, reality and philosophy and much more embedded in this package and I loved most of it.My favorite line is 'I wonder, is it better to live like a monster, or die a good man?' from the protagonist Teddy Daniels.I am surprised that this is the third film that was made from his novel and I have seen the other two too. So Dennis Lehane should be the one I should make time to read some day. I saw his other adaptations 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'Mystic River' and I liked both of them too.This film is a 4/5 and I am afraid I may not sit through this film another time. Yet, I am going to remember this for a long time to come.",8,0,1,8 September 2016
Life of Pi," An adventure that gave me seasickness
","A silly dumb adventure that sails on sea for most part and left me with seasickness.At the end of the movie, I was hearing claps in the theatre and I was wondering what have they liked so much in the film because I did not like anything. Yes, the visual effects were good, but nowhere near a movie like JURASSIC PARK. Don't even compare with AVATAR please. The plot, oh, where is the plot, a boy gets lost in a sea because of a thunderstorm and he takes a trip with a tiger and for the good part of it, both are struck together in sea. The episode was too long for me and just made me feel like it's giving me seasickness. Now, where did it go wrong? If I may say so, then in the writing itself that does not involve audience much. That is, it did not do anything to me. It neither thrilled me nor moved me nor made me laugh out loud. It went on and on and got me drowsy by the end. The only good thing is special effects that are good, but I am sure many movies in recent past have come with better effects and better ideas. Hailed by many as one of the best films of this year, I would rather say, it's a boring adventure. It is good for the first half hour or even an hour I would say, but after that it goes on and on and the sad part is it has inevitable end. It's not a kind of movie that could have ended anyway, the adventure has to end and the boy has to grow and the big Pi (Irrfan Khan) is going to tell this to his friend. Hey, now there is a twist, he tells this adventure and he tells a believable story while normal people stick to his believable story, his writer friend likes the adventure. So I as audience, had to give in to something and I was rather interested in the story he told than this adventure. The best moments are done in the first half an hour itself with Pi and his family in Pondicherry, once he gets on a ship, and gets lost, it stays for sometime, but man, those jelly fish, those whales, even that royal Bengal tiger that was made in CGI did not help me liking it. So I disliked it to the core. Once, he said Richard Parker (Tiger) was gone at the end, I fell into sleep, I just couldn't take that. Damn, we had been there at the very night of a day (Night 11 PM show) and with all the pains taken, we see an adventure end just like that. It meant nothing for me, and I am going with a 1/5. This 1 rating is for the special effects and the gorgeous titles that were good but not great. Ang Lee, you squeezed me in to this film and you gave me a bad film so this is what I give you back, a negative review. I suppose I among the very few who are going to criticize this movie as most others are going gaga over this. It's okay; I have my own mind anyways.",2,15,60,24 November 2012
Interstellar," Its by far one of the most abstruse and absurd sci-fi film from an acclaimed director.
","Its by far one of the most abstruse and absurd sci-fi film from an acclaimed director.Christopher Nolan, is a director of great potential. His body of work speaks volumes of what he has done and what he has capable of. After all he is also a human being, and I suppose he has forgotten that humans have limitations. This film is illustrious of the limitation, which is that the director does not have an audience that thoroughly understands quantum physics.I am a big lover of physics and was a faculty of the same for 4 years of my life. Yet, the dialogs were incomprehensible by me. I must admit my in-competencies here as quantum physics, time travel are something not in my sphere of thorough understanding. Yet, I must also admit that this is the first Nolan film, I felt bored. I dozed off briefly after 20 minutes in the film and it never ever happened in a Nolan film for me. Now, there are few comparisons I would like to draw with an earlier film of Nolan, that is INCEPTION. If Inception, was also equally incomprehensible in the first go, it made me rush to the theater to decipher what it was all about. While INTERSTELLAR is also incomprehensible in the first viewing, it lacked the drive to push me to see it once again. Indeed, I felt exhausted after a near 170 minutes. The performances were superb and Matthew McConaughey has given a terrific performance. He is more a father than an astronomer. Others were all appreciable too. The technicalities were brilliant but those were all on the expected lines, considering the scale of the film. What I am only disappointed is, the screenplay lacked Nolan's magic. Yet, there are moment of awe and the climax, indeed the final shot was surely my pick as it triggers some thoughts in the brain.As per me, this is a lackluster film form a genius of a director. More than anything else, I am just disappointed.If you want to watch a great sci-fi film, there are many ranging from the 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY to the most recent GRAVITY. If you see this and feel this is great then I would congratulate your feeling. For me this is an exhausting lesson in quantum physics.Also, a word about the IMAX where I saw this. The IMAX in Hong Kong is way below the quality I admired in Hyderabad, India. The screen seems much smaller, the audio is not up to the quality, the acoustics are not updated as per technology. I miss the IMAX at Hyderabad in these aspects.A 2/5 for this film, For sure, you may neither love it, nor hate it but surely you cannot ignore it.",4,5,8,8 September 2015
Full Metal Jacket," An enigmatic war tale that was trivialized without proper direction.
","An enigmatic war tale that was trivialized without proper direction.Stanley Kubrick the master, shows war on the face yet again. The earlier film where he showed us war as it is, is 'Paths of Glory'. He returns to how brutal the training camp shall be to how gruesome and ruthless and merciless war shall be. He sure has a humane touch yet it seems disjointed in this one. Based on the trauma of American Soldiers in the Vietnam War, this movie travels from the training camp to the actual battlefield and takes pit stops in between to devise strategies of the war. Walking through the corridors of the camp to the trenches of the war-field the ambiance created is perfect and it made me as if I were there. This is a commonality in most Kubrick movies as he takes the audience right to the place where the scene is happening and that's the reason he is so great. He transposes, trans locates and takes the audience into a trance of the movie, where we believe that it is happening for real. He then asks us the question, how do we feel? Ah, I love Kubrick just for this. Having said that, this movie fails in terms of keeping the viewer focused due to the disorientation it goes through. I love Kubrick more than most and yet I found this to be a movie less interesting, though it made me sit for the whole length and just made a vague impression rather than a strong one. It is superb technically, but Kubrick made much better war movies than this. I am disappointed does not mean this is bad, this film is no way bad and I rate this 3/5, good one, just not the perfect Kubrick one.",6,0,1,8 September 2014
Pacific Rim," A well done fake film.
","A well done fake film. It's overtly formulaic and over the top action. I do not like action movies for some unless there is a story worth rooting for. This has action that is technically brilliant but it does not have a have worth rooting for. It's all open and shut from the word go. We know the heroes, the villains, the conflict. It's how they overcome is what shall be projected differently.Technically you may say it's brilliant. I will agree to that only partially coz greatest technology devoid of human concern will not work. Similarly, there is more of commerce in this than concern for heart. So it did not work for me. How greatly you will project the conflict and how shall it be made with thorough 3d technology is what was looked into. Now this disappointed me.Considering that this a film of Guillermo Del Toro who gave us 'Pan's Labyrinth' earlier it irks me more. I am not happy with what I have seen in this film. You may like it or love it. I just did not in many ways. This is strictly mediocre in content and high on technology. A 2/5 would be the best I can give this film. See it if you like some action packed scenes and high quality graphics.",4,1,2,24 August 2014
American Sniper," A terrific war film, that is more about the inner war than the external one.
","A terrific war film, that is more about the inner war than the external one.Based on the 2003 Iraq war, the movie is about Chris Kyle, the sniper who recorded 160 deaths from his own shoots officially. It's tough to kill someone, but when you are paid to kill, it becomes a profession, a duty. War involves a lot of killing and it does show up. Every soldier who killed someone perhaps goes through a lot of emotion after he the killing. It's because soldiers learn how to value a life.In this story, we have a protagonist whose conflict within keeps him going and makes him stronger. Seldom have I seen a protagonist with such integrity and who is true to his profession. Vulnerability is something he innately possesses but he does not succumb. This protagonist has almost all the qualities of an ideal man. If the real person, Chris Kyle, on whose life the movie was based was someone as tough as shown in film, I salute his spirit and courage.Bradley Cooper, who played the role of Chris Kyle, gave a poised and a nuanced performance. Though he shoots most of the time, he pierces any sensitive heart through his expression. To be ruthless is hard but to act being ruthless and yet empathizing is tough. I sincerely believe only few actors can pull off a role as tight as this one. Thankfully, Bradley pulls it off with aplomb.Above all, I appreciate Clint Eastwood. I hardly know any director, who is not only maniacal but also rolls out a film almost every year. Watch it for real action, no nonsense stuff and for the spirit of Chris Kyle. Above all, watch it for Clint Eastwood's vision.A 4/5 for this.",8,7,10,8 September 2015
Forrest Gump," Here, we have a story that is worth being told for generations to come.
","Here, we have a story that is worth being told for generations to come.A story of a man, who had everything going against him and yet he did whatever best he could. And when you do your best in whatever you have taken upon, you would mostly succeed. And there in lies the story of FORREST GUMP. When you are determined, even Gods would come down embracing you. Look at that scene in which there were no shrimps and after the hurricane there is plethora of shrimps and they become millionaires.Yet, most of it is untrue and even hypothetical, like running coast to coast for 3 years. Even such fabrications will be loved and embraced, if we love this man called Forrest Gump. He does everything from meeting the president to running the whole of America to being a war hero and setting up his own business and becoming a millionaire. And did I say, this was against all the odds, he had, yes, he did not have legs and he got them back by running, he is mentally retarded, yet he proves all of them wrong by being successful in everything he does. Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, has given us one of the best performances ever and this is a great character in itself. I have learnt from wikipedia that Robert Zemeckis the director, deviated from the novel written by Winston Groom. Now, what he did as a the director was a good thing and that is what I strongly believe. I did not read the novel though, but I loved Gump the way he is, so I think the changes were good. Technically, I liked the editing, though nearly 2 and half hours long, it was not at all so boring. Also, the screenplay by Eric Roth was good. The direction, I loved it. Look at that feather fly from skies to Gump's feet and then fly away at the end, just a glimpse of what direction is. Special effects were great specially in terms of putting Gump with the presidents and even John Lennon, I just liked the way it was all done. Also, I loved the dialogue and what a piece of writing this was, you can turn simple things interesting by saying them in an interesting way, and this movie does that through dialogue.Above all, I loved Forrest Gump as he is and more than anything, I loved Tom Hanks as Forrest, this is a great portrayal of a character. From dialect, to walking style to costumes, everything was appealing and interesting about Forrest Gump.It's a 4/5 for a movie that is great in terms of characterisation of a man who has has a 'JUST DO IT' spirit and for Tom Hanks who has given one of the best performances.",8,1,1,19 September 2014
Gone Baby Gone," It's a thriller and suspenseful film for sure but is hurried up.
","It's a thriller and suspenseful film for sure but is hurried up.At times, we need to set aside our beliefs the rules and what we stand for, to save a life. The last scene where Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) baby sits Amanda (the little girl) made me ask a question, 'What is home?' Is home something that makes us happy or is it something, where we have people whom we know but they just don't bother if we even exist or not. Poor Amanda was home just to be taken out in what forms a good detective case. Like the mother who said that the dolls name was Mirabelle, the little girl says it's Annabelle. Gosh, the mother does not even know here kids favorite toys name.The taking is good, but screenplay is hurried up, I could not understand in the climax where there were too many scenes flashing, now whose perspective was this all shown. So it's hurried up and does not give us space to contemplate quickly and appreciate how the case was solved. Cinematography was good and so was the whole setup that is art direction. Acting was good especially by Ed Harris. But Casey Affleck did disappoint me at places where I expected a lot as he promised in this. Others were good and especially Amy Ryan as Helene, the drug addict mom stood out in her role.All said and done, I recommend a watch for those who like some fast paced movies. It's not all good pace either, it's sluggish and a routine case till we find what happened to that baby, it took one hour for that and the next hour just rolls on so quick that too many things are revealed in too less time. I am not happy with editing of this film. It's just not right for me and it did not work for me..It's 3/5 for a good movie for sure, yet it falls short at places to be said a must watch.",6,0,1,19 September 2014

","One of my favourite movies ever and even today I love it more.It's about something that is cute more than something that is required. We have most of things in our movies but here is a story who loves a kid, who indeed misses his the kids little things. The story is set in a Monster city where Monsters have to make kids cry or scare them rather. The scared kids screams produce energy that shall be used in the city. The premise of any PIXAR film, till I think UP was just so beautiful and nice till something went wrong. OK, so this movie has something that is cut and that is the little kid called 'BOO' I love her so much and each time I see this, I love her more. The animation is wonderful here especially for her. And for me BOO is the cutest kid ever seen on a film.The animation quality of PIXAR is outstanding, from the hairs of James P Sullivan to the setup of the doors to the whole Monsters world, it is too very detailed and amazing. I wish I could see this in theatre but alas I couldn't. The characters are superb and if Mike Wozawski is comical then, Randall, the dragon is cunning and a dastardly villain. At the bottom of this movie, like in most other PIXAR movies is an underline text and that is a father-daughter relationship. Sullivan becomes the father who starts taking care of BOO. This very care and what he actually misses when BOO is not around or what he loves about BOO makes the crux to an extent. Thanks to the PIXAR team for giving such a wonderful film that can be shown for generations of Kids and most kids love it I hope. A 5/5 for this.",10,0,1,8 September 2014
American Hustle," Classic Film making. I wish it could have been done so well, without some uncalled for dialogs.
","Classic Film making. I wish it could have been done so well, without some uncalled for dialogs.Yes, there is a plot, there is a twist and there is more to add to characters than what they are, and there is style. This is what classic films are made of. Interesting characters, good plot and good production values. Yet, there is something missing called good dialog and good screenplay, that would have made this good film a great film.I liked it, but I was OK with it and did not feel any better after watching this. The dialogs are made up of nail polish and hairstyles which seem so irrelevant actually. Yet, they are made to fit into the plot. What role will a nail polish play in a con man's life. Indeed I dozed off midway through the first hour and when I woke up 10 minutes later, nothing changed, I could catch up with the film pretty easily. That's the pace of the film. It's slow and involves lot of talking. I have no problem in listening to dialog, but dialog of this kind is tough to bear. The plot is about money and the dialog seems to deviate all that. So that's the main thing that did not work for me. Else, unquestionably it is a good film technically. The art direction, costume design, make up are wonderful. Cinematography was good but at times, there was noise on screen. My biggest crib is editing. Was it deliberately made into such a long movie? I am sure if I were the editor, it would have been considerably less in time. The best part though is acting. All the actors have performed exceedingly well. From Christian Bale as Irving, the protagonist to Robert De Niro who comes in a guest role. It is terrific acting. I do not want to say anything about the plot, but just giving the meaning of hustle here. The music used was also good, the Jefferson Airplane song 'White Rabbit' is in Arabic and is nice. Others songs are also good. hustle : To obtain something by deceitful or illicit means; practice theft or swindling. A 3/5 will be just for this. There are many better movies in terms of writing and direction.",6,0,1,24 August 2014
Notting Hill," I liked it but not to the extent that I love it.
","I liked it but not to the extent that I love it.It's a good film, a fun watch but it's clichéd in dialog and screenplay. It relies heavily on the two leads, Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. Though Julia Roberts as Anna Scott does her part with ease, Hugh Grant as Will Thacker seems to be shaky, and uncomfortable. Also, its way too long with a running time of more than two hours for something that a very light romantic comedy. Editing lacks hold in an otherwise well written film. But the dialog ruins the well written scenes by putting some mediocre lines that were extremely predictable by me. I felt, this film did not have the charm of romances like 'When Harry Met Sally' or 'Love Actually'. The chemistry between Julia and Hugh though made up for most flaws, it did not cover them well enough. Just an exampleWilliam Thacker: I've opened Pandora's Box! Spike: I knew a girl named Pandora in High School once...Never did see her box though!If such jokes make you laugh and smile, then this movie is certainly for you. For me, this was a very poor joke and I could not buy such jokes. The sad part is the film is filled with such lines and that is why I did not like it much. For sure, there are good aspects in terms of production. But with such actors at the helm and budget taking a toll, those things are expected too. Writer Richard Curtis seems to be a good one at slapstick comedy and slick dialogs but what he is not is mastering the same and adding a touch and flavor of his own. The same 'I love you' can be said in innumerable ways but it has to be one that will be attractive and has it's own place in the hearts of the viewer. I am going with 2/5 for this. Though its a very well made romantic comedy. It lacks that specialty of becoming greater than a normal film. I am also skeptical if this will stand the test of time either.",4,0,1,7 September 2014

","The Lord of the Rings has changed the scope of fantasy films forever. The Fellowship of the Ring was just the beginning.This is a fantastic fantasy film and just a start yet.I have seen the trilogy 3 times and after nearly 10 years, I am revisiting the trilogy. Even now, if give me a thrill that is unparalleled. Now, I know what is going to come but still I wait for the unfolding. I am seeing this in awe and for appreciation of the caliber that was put in the making of these films.The fellowship gave details and the tone is perfectly right. There is a backdrop story that is explained so that those who have not read the book can understand what the story is all about. Why is the title named 'Lord of The Rings in the first place? Also, why is this part called 'The Fellowship of the Ring'.As we travel with the film, the mysteries and solved and we get a clear and bright picture of what the whole thing is about. I watch these films and am now revisiting them because in all these years I have not seen any fantasy film that has such great usage of graphics and keeps things real. The sky, the grasslands, the mountains, the marshes, the landscape everything seems real. Perhaps, all these exist in some part of the world today.The major part of the film was shot in Norther Islands of New Zealand and no film I believe I can capture or depict New Zealand's landscape as this film has done.Peter Jackson deserves all the kudos for translating a novel by the same name, into a near perfect film on celluloid.Perhaps, I will revisit this some time again. Till then 5/5. Thanks to all those, who made this film and this trilogy a possibility of such magnanimity.",10,0,0,25 January 2016
The Revenant," A revengeful survivor story set in a terrific landscape.
","A revengeful survivor story set in a terrific landscape.It's beautiful to look at from the word go but it's a painful to see the protagonist coping with adversities and becoming a hero. It's a story set in the 19th century so there are horses for commuting and stones for making fire. Yet, the theme is universal and so it can be considered a contemporary story with a couple of centuries old backdrop. I went to see the film for two reasons, the director Alejandro Inarittu and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and both seemed to in good form although not in their prime form. Nevertheless, that's enough to make a good film. Technically, the cinematography is top notch and the production design is terrific. The whole crew has to be complimented for working a whole film in such a drastic and unpredictable weather and landscape. The editing could have been more precise. Too many frames of nature, I felt and I hoped for more characters than nature. Makeup is amazing and I suppose it's makeup and costume design is one of the finest I saw in recent times. What disappointed me was the screenplay. This film seemed a bit stretched out and predictability killed the fun. When you know, the path and also the destiny, there is no fun anymore and this film showed me both after few minutes into it.Leonardo has invested a lot of his time and his physical transformation and fearless acting tells why he is one of the finest actors ever. I got my money worth, solely by his performance. Though for me his Aviator, Blood Diamond, and The Departed are his best, this performance stands tall too.Overall, it's a well-written film but 20 minutes short, this would be a great film. As it is, it's fine for me.A 3/5 for a good film, but once again full marks to Leonardo DiCaprio. Respect.",6,1,2,25 January 2016

He begins by fixing machines and by the end fixes humans too. It's a simple and yet so well presented. Director Martin Scorcese who is legendary and has a vision of a genius brings this out beautifully right from the very first frame. The scene where the camera traverses all possible things just to give us the glimpse of where the boy is right at the beginning is in itself a statement and the mood has been set for the ride. This in itself seemed to be a Martin Scorcese biopic as the one who had to find himself in his movies. He was not lost or absent, he was there all these years, yet something was missing, something what I loved in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas was missing and Hugo just brought his touch back. That is, the movie digresses into various subplots and yet the central theme remains a stand out. The whole trip begins with the hint of a girl being avoided for movies. It takes from there on to a different level of discovering a masterpiece and the master behind it.So in his discovery, there are so many things that unfold and the best part is to know how cinema was made. So I loved this in every way and I wish Scorcese just keeps the film rolling and brings out more adventures like this.Scorcese made documentaries on great film makers like Kubrick etc.. but this was his greatest tribute to cinema in itself.A 4/5 for a movie that's a must watch. I wish it was released in India so that I can catch the 3D fun, but I am happy with the blu ray I got for now.",8,0,1,20 September 2014
The Shining," Just so wonderful and insanely masterful in placing such scenes and depicting them on screen.
","'Heeeere's Johnny!' and 'All Work and No Play, makes Jack a Dull boy'. Just so wonderful and insanely masterful in placing such scenes and depicting them on screen.Stanley Kubrick, the master story teller has indeed made one of the most spine chilling and scariest movies ever. Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance did an awesome job. This is a film that not only scares you but also gives nightmares. Dare to watch it non stop without fast forwarding or pausing and you may feel something like you have never felt or rarely felt before. It is written superbly by Stephen King but I will say this is more a Kubrick masterpiece as he visualised the whole and brought the writing alive. A wow to the master Kubrick. It works on many levels be it psychological or technical, there are steadicam scenes, some insane scenes, some symbolism. Like REDRUM is reversed as MURDER and many many more. Jack becomes from being completely normal to tally mad. There is a history to the whole setup and it's all so very intriguing.The whole cast has to be awarded for doing what they did and specially that boy Danny Lloyd. While Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall did perfectly. Over and above everything was location and art direction here. Be it the creation of a vast maze or that creepy hotel and that detailing of every room and nook and corner of it. The trail to the hotel, wow everything was so masterfully done. Cinematography is something that we can learn, those strolling scenes of kid on cycle through the hall, or those maze scenes, or the car travelling through high road. Each one is shot so exquisitely, I fell in love with most of them.Watch it for Kubrick's brilliance, it's the perfect suspense film. A 5/5 for this. Just can't say more. Go and understand what Shining is, they know everything.",10,1,3,19 September 2014
Duck Soup," One of the finest comedies and indeed the wittiest of many.
","One of the finest comedies and indeed the wittiest of many.Witty lines and scenes make this film a fantastic one to watch. It's a laugh riot and does full throttle. It's uncompromising in vision which is a rarity considering 1933 where studios determined what has to be shown. Marx brothers who are considered as comedy giants in their times, gave wonderful performances in this film. From a retort to 'Tanks' (which is thought as 'Thanks') with a 'Welcome' to many many moments where it's tough to hold back our laughs, this film is spanned with nothing but wit and comedy. I dare say, it is one of the funniest films I watched in a long time. It's hilarious and comical, it's also strongly satirical and political too. It takes on war, politics behind war and what kings or rulers do. The best part is it never takes itself seriously even for iota of a moment and gives out gags where each one is wonderfully joyful. Groucho Marx as Firefly, gives a wonderful performance probably the finest of his life from the word go. He dances, sings, and utters some of the wittiest lines uttered ever on film screen. His act as a Mussolini like is wonderful and more so as excellency of Fredonia. From his entry till the last frame, he makes this film his own. He is ably supported by his own brothers Harpo, Chico and Zeppo who give wonderful scenes too. My only crib is that it is too short. At 68 minutes, this film gives out so many wonderful moments that it leaves us yearning for more. Should this have been edited, I would be very disappointed, coz every frame is precious in this film and has to be embraced. This film is now 80 years old and it is still so young and infectious in wit and the sheer energy on screen. I wish again, to see more than 68 minutes of this. One of the greatest comedies ever, a 5/5 for this. Wit, humor and outstandingly performed this a must watch for every film lover.",10,7,10,7 September 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Hmm...It reduced from a great thriller to a simple murder mystery
","Hmm...It reduced from a great thriller to a simple murder mysteryWhen I watched it first time a few months earlier, I was in awe of Rooney Mara and the way the whole subject was handled and directed and finally made into a movie. When I watched it today, all my enthusiasm came down to the understanding of a simple murder mystery of a girl who has for some reason been assumed to be killed by someone.Amidst this murder case, there is a libel case which our hero Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has lost to Wennerstorm and this comes back much later just to redeem the lost glory of our hero. Now who does all this is Lisbeth Salander played wonderfully by Roonery Mara, she is a surprise to all those who have not known much about her and her ability. All other departments fared well and a special mention to David Fincher and what a movie he has made up. This is a mystery that holds up for long and he does a pretty good job till he held the mystery. Once, we know the murderer is known, he gives away the fun. Also, I am not sure if Wennerstorn was a main plot or a subplot coz he takes up the last 15 mins of film which I don't think was so important and just a glimpse of what happened to him was enough. Having said that, those 15 minutes were important too in establishing the GIRL as one superb woman who can go to any extent to does what she believes in. But she does all of those very unrealistically, can't we just simply bluff so many European officials, I really doubt. David Fincher has lost it only at the end apart from which most of it was good, yes cinematography was exceptional and so was the background music, editing should have been so lot better, the same duo who worked for 'The Social Network worked for this and they won an Academy award even for this but I did not like this film's editing though.If there is any reason for watching this movie then it's Rooney Mara. It's a 3/5 for a good movie that's good as a murder mystery and OK OK for everything else. It just could have been so better had a few moments been cut out.Note : I did not see the Swedish version, nor did I read the book, I perceived the film as it is, if anyone is offended then please take it easy.",6,2,3,19 September 2014
Being John Malkovich," Wow. It's one hell of a ride
","Wow. It's one hell of a rideI didn't know till the first hour where the plot that has been built up will lead to and in the next it had much more than I had thought. A simple puppeteer's life is in shackles with the truth he has learnt but will be like that forever or will it become normal again (as it happens in Hollywood movies) a happy family is shattered with an incident but it stays happy in the end with a compromise or resolution or something...but no not here...As I promised I am not going to reveal the story here...but even if I did for this its a must experience movie as it has too many things involved.....There is this puppeteer Craig Schwartz who gets a job in a rather mysterious 71/2 (but well explained in a 2 minute TV show) floor and finds out that actually there is a way that leads to the brain of John Malkovich. Simple on paper it may seem but the entire transformation and revelations begin then.... He learns that his wife is transsexual...his colleague whom he wanted to make love with actually wants to sleep with john malkovich with his wife in his head. He is lost totally...he then cages his wife and goes into Malkovich head and makes love with his colleague...and yes the puppeteer comes now...he realizes that he could control his actions and does so...yes by touching her colleague's left boob at will.....but having said all this........there are more surprises left....What if Malkovich himself entered the head of Malkovich? That is sorted out.....EVERYTHING BECOMES MALKOVICH.....everything seen and heard is just Malkovich.....wow......a crazy idea and yes it is right to an extent...whenever I thought too much about my own self I could see myself doing something (it was an illusion) but this aspect is really thrilling to know and may also make one go crazy....anyways back to plot......It is now.......Craig wants to Stay in Malkovich forever and does so...he makes Malkovich a success full puppeteer.....and earns money.....lives the life of a millionaire kind.....now his colleague is pregnant rightly so as they have been making love but wait...again a surprise...OK now a bit or retrospection and inquisitive, engrossed too much into the thing that what would happen next, I almost lost that why was there a portal....only for malkovich or why basically there is a way into his head.......its learnt later and its related to construction of 71/2 floor (that's a hint)....It's a clear movie..it seems to solve the answers that it has raised itself......and yet it still ends ask many more psychological questions......what would it be if we are in another soul feels it feels, see what it sees, hear what it hears....man this is a crazy thing......but an experience to experiment with.Having almost revealed the entire story or plot, the acting is top notch and realistic even in this highly fictitious drama... John Cusack as Craig just excels ....he must have practiced pup petering a lot for this...and so did John Malkovich....Cameron Diaz lives as if she has been living with her pets, the chimpanzee, a dog, a bird for ages....there are other animals...like a chameleon too....and the witch (don't know its a right thing to say) played by Catherine Keener is just right...and even the other actors perform aptlyAll said and above, Kudos to writer Charlie Kaufman for writing such a thing and for Spike Jonze for accepting to make it and making it so engagingly.......It's a must take ride.... One must be someone else....RATING: 5/5",10,0,2,20 September 2014
The Intouchables," A touching film that is titled the Intouchables.
","A touching film that is titled the Intouchables. I fell on the film through the IMDb top 250 list. I vow myself to complete that list soon. When I watched the trailer it was reminiscent of another film 'The Bucket List', so that set the expectation. Yet, when I watched the whole film, I was happier, more involved and I felt it was more realistic. Omar Sy, the actor who played the role of Driss did an amazing job. After many films, I was left awestruck by such a realistic and easy performance. He lived it, just did not play the part is what I felt.The screenplay was terrific, it was straight and without any complications. The film just flew by in 1 hour 52 minutes of running time, thus, I owe the credit to editing which was apt.Directors were faithful I believe to the original story which was two real persons. I thank the writers and directors for being unsympathetic and yet very realistic with the film.One word that I can echo with the film is 'Pragmatic'. This film shows that interesting stories can be told in a realistic manner and without any melodrama.A 5/5 for this. Loved it.",10,0,0,18 January 2016
Ratatouille," One of the best movies of the decade
","The only predictable thing in life is it's unpredictability, a dialogue in this movie stands so true to the spirit of Ratatouille.A rat loves food, wants to become a chef so to have better food and does. Now this storyline is showed in the best way it could have been. The backdrop is chosen to be Paris, the best place where lifestyle is on top, and food is a priority. And rats which in actuality I suppose are few in number in the city are shown to be thieves and one of them who has a certain sense wants to have it the best way possible that is to cook.Written and Directed by Brad Bird this is one of the best stories to come on screen. The music too complements the screenplay and thats why I believe academy has awarded them with Oscars.Many things can be learnt from this, how defiance helps even when the chips are down, how selfishness to have the best quality to one self in turn may help others but ultimately it satisfies because it's done for self and not for others. But yeah this being a film we may demean them as life is still a different ball game altogether.One of the best movies of the decade and it's 5/5.",10,0,2,20 September 2014
The Lego Movie," A fun film that made me a kid. Of course, I am already a proud kid.
","A fun film that made me a kid. Of course, I am already a proud kid.Never since TOY STORY 3, I had so much fun in an animated film. Also, this film made me nostalgic as I used play with Lego toys when I was a kid. So there are some personal things that are attached with this film, and indeed they drove me to the film more than the trailer of the film itself.The film is a simple, the premise that an ordinary guy can become a hero, only if he believes in himself is well presented. It's not a film that has epic conflict or great story. But it's charm lies in the writing, the wit that is inevitably laughable. Most were laughing out loud in the theater, from my 4 year nephew to a 70 year grand uncle. The animation is surely top notch, we have to consider that making a 3D film with real toys is really challenging, and that's where the animation industry in Hollywood must be praised for. Their quality of animation just keeps getting higher and higher and it's so wonderful for the cinema world over. The music plays a vital role is conveying that indeed 'everything is awesome'. Also, the well choreographed events and the detailing of the animation is great. It's all colorful and pleasing to the eyes and the 3D technology gets due justification in a few scenes too. I am going with 4/5 and would love to catch it again at the theaters with more kids around, I loved it and hopefully if you ever see it, the kid in you is revealed or you are helped a great deal by your own kids.",8,7,10,17 August 2014
The Usual Suspects," A one time watch is enough to remember this for a life time.
","A one time watch is enough to remember this for a life time. It's an impact film is what I can definitely say. As, this is a suspense-thriller, I cannot reveal the suspense or anything. Yet, I just want to say that the cold-bloodedness of a character makes it way too obvious and provides an indication of what is going to come across. Acting is masterful by all, especially by Kevin Spacey who alone rallies the ensemble cast by his stoned face and supreme voice narration.This is not only a well acted film but also a well written one. The writing is sharp and straight. Undoubtedly it deserves the accolades it received for writing and also Kevin Spacey's acting.Overall, a must watch for the lovers of cinema, but if you predict the twist, the I am not sure if you will even like this film.It's a good one still and not a great one for me as other aspects of the film technicalities might have been much better. A 3/5 for this.",6,0,0,8 September 2015
Inside Out," I loved this movie and cried like crazy.
","I loved this movie and cried like crazy.Happy to have seen this in theaters, and happy to have found my sleeping kid. The kid that sleeps within me and always jumps awake at the opportune moment, was so happy seeing this. OK, now cut the kid and let the sane adult talk, as this is a review by an adult and not a kid.This adult has a story, a teenage story of changing school, being a rebel at home, and fighting with parents and teachers all through the years that he was at a new school. I changed my school when I was thirteen and the next couple of years were hell for my parents and teachers. A student with supreme conduct, suddenly turned into a disinterested rowdy with the change of school. The new school I was put in did not have good teachers, who could sing or play. They always used to teach in the most uninteresting way, and I hated all of it.OK, that's a little insight into my teenage years, but above all, this is a film that has much more than insight. I connected with this film on a deeper level, perhaps I too love reading minds. This movie is something that explores the feelings of emotions, how we react when we feel, how do we emote that feeling, it's so much more about us within than many other films, that are all about characters, plot, themes etc. This movie, could possibly be about you, check this to find that out. I found something for me and was extremely happy.The director has a daughter and she is nearly the same age as the film's protagonist Riley. Now, what's her age? Go watch the film, or as some lazy bugs do, just do some Wikipedia about director, the film, his daughter etc. I am unapologetic and actually unhappy with those who read this review and do not end up watching this.Technically, PIXAR has achieved more than any other animation studio in the world in terms of animation, story-telling and development of characters and trust me, this film is on par with any PIXAR film you have liked, be it FINDING NEMO or MONSTERS INC or TOY STORY or many more including WALL-E and UP.Having said all that, do I still need to rate this? I will do, just for the takers, it's a 5/5. I love this and I need not say more.",10,8,36,8 September 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Lovely film, lovely story and I thank my lovely wife.
","Lovely film, lovely story and I thank my lovely wife.My better half insisted that I watch this film and for her I did watch it. I must mention I cried a lot upon watching this. Thanks to the emotions involved. It's a simple story that's very simply told. The beauty lay in the simplicity here. Two teenagers have health problems and they meet and decide to spend some time together. That's the story line, but one does for another is what the story is all about. Oops, I spilled the story out, oh that is fine because I did not tell even one bit. I must say, I found some similarities to Erich Seagal's 'Love Story' but that's the end of it. Life is a journey and it's beautiful when you have the right company. I found mine in my partner, Siri. Yes, I call her Siri and for this journey called life, she is the one I have decided to travel with. I am super happy right now and exploring movies such as this, makes our time more beautiful. It's a movie that is adapted from the same name and I give credit to the writer of the novel John Green above all. Shailene Woodley gave a super performance here that is worth all the praise and much more. The director did a commendable job in putting the cast right for the story and also getting a just adequate amount of emotions. Never did I feel anything was melodramatic in the tear-jerker. Watch this to know, how much we are grateful to be fine and happy. This gave me an opportunity to show gratitude to live and to my wife. A 4/5 for this. The love story hangs in the top class league.",8,0,0,18 January 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A long and tiring saga that's not refreshing but rather boring.
","A long and tiring saga that's not refreshing but rather boring.Till the time I saw, gollum near the end, it was a tale that was largely boring. Only when Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) met Gollum, that creepy character of Lord of the Rings I got some interest. Yes, it had action sequences but they were few and far apart. The film was flu of dialogue and a build up only. That's fine if the dialogue evoked laughs or moved me with tears pr did something, but here it was doing nothing for me, I was watching it without feeling for it, and that's where the film lost me elsewhere. I am a big fan of LOTR and yet I did not like in fact I loved Fellowship of the ring so much more coz that gave me a reasoning and understanding of characters and a back story Here, we had a back story which I thought would be equally interesting as it is Peter Jackson at the helm, but it is rather tiring and however hard I tried, I just missed most of it. Did I say, I watched it in IMAX screen, oh, how I wish then an experience could have been so very great. But what it turned out was a drowsy session for me as I was feeling sleepy as even those sitting beside me did. This film seemed so very long indeed and I am not sure if I would go into the next part again. Now, let me tell you one thing as an LOTR fan, I loved LOTR and I expected a similar kind of experience but that was not be. It was overlong and mostly the story was going between 13 dwarfs and it was not an easy task even to remember the name of those 13 tiny ones. What's more disappointing was the climax conflict between our hero who is not Bilbo Baggins, but Thorin. This fight too was not up to the expectations in any kind. In reality, the book HOBBIT is just about 300 pages and making a trilogy out of that seems to be rather uncalled for after seeing this film. Technically, yes this film had a few positives They used 48 fps as against the conventional 24 fps. The art direction is superb and so is the cinematography. But, that's not just what I wanted from HOBBIT, I needed an adventure and I thoroughly missed that, an adventure is not just about going on horses and returning empty handed, it is much more.If you are willing to succumb to it and have a keen year and understand every dialogue minutely, you may find how many things were actually not needed. Like the jokes at the dinner table just to establish the traits of 13 dwarfs, now each must have contributed in any which way to help their King, but they are just lying and eating while Gandalf and Thorin do most of the job. I can't even call this team work.So, I disliked it but I think many love it as LOTR fans, as they expect the finale to be the as grand as the LOTR - Return of the king. For me, I am not going watch the sequels may be unless someone really trustworthy comes and tell me to at least try watching them. Giving a generous 2/5. It was a tiresome three hours for me.",4,6,9,19 September 2014
Before Sunset," Now if Before Sunrise was great, this is much better too.
","Now if Before Sunrise was great, this is much better too.Jesse and Celine have met last 9 years ago, Jesse comes up with a book and while describing it in a bookstall in Paris, he meets Celine again. Now, where will this brief encounter lead to, where ever it would end p, the path is for sure gonna be beautiful and that's how it is. With a beautiful romantic work already done, the director ups the ante this time and how? By making it more time bound and more mature. Jesse and Celine have grown up now, what they thought as everything beautiful is not so as it turns out. They feel imprisoned in their own lives, they have learnt to embrace the shortcomings of what we call is an imperfect world, they speak more fluidly and are more comfortable with each other s they already had a meeting earlier. Richard Linklater seems to be a master in telling what he would like to tell and in his own inimitable style. He has got aides in Ethan Hawke as Jesse and Julie Delpy as Celine who have added so much to dialog in what is primarily a conversational movie. Can you believe that the whole movie is shot the way the characters speak out, that is as they speak for an hour long, the movie is precisely that much duration only. Now, so many interesting things come up in this conversation.Going with 5/5 this time too and I love this so much to have a repeat watch.",10,0,0,19 September 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Heroes are made in most unexpected circumstances.
","Heroes are made in most unexpected circumstances. Courage is what takes a man forward. I think the director of this film Dean DeBlois believes that strongly. Because, his belief is evident in the treatment of the film. From characterization to emotions and even a including a humorous tiny sub plot. This film comes of as a sequel that dares to beat the original itself. Its multi layered in terms of screenplay and characterization. Look at the scene where Hiccup discovers a strange place and in that a person whom he missed. The conversations are good and are deep in emotion. Even the tiny discovery of using the flaps on the tail of Toothless seems endearing. The small things add up to the big picture and give us a magnanimous feeling. Never there was a dull moment in this pacey animated film. Whilst most animated films have to indulge in a song dance sequence, lot of peppy feel-good music and histrionics of the characters. This film, keeps it pretty simple, it cuts straight into the story, does not waste a moment in discovering characters and the purpose of the film and then achieves it without much hype. Damn, terrific is the writing and kudos to the director Dean DeBlois for his bravery. As it has been said 'Fortune Favours the Brave' and this film proves that saying yet again.The editing is sharp, the cinematography is super and the animation is simply class apart. It embeds the motion picture and the typical storyboard animation beautifully and in an IMAX 3D, it comes alive. Thanks to the pain the animators took in detailing. It's all rendered beautifully on screen.DreamWorks is not a PIXAR yet, I suppose if it sticks to films like these, I hope it can better that animation company. Of course, since TOY STORY 3, PIXAR did not stand up to it's name yet. And apart from the Shrek franchise DreamWorks itself did not make it big. With this Franchise, I suppose it has got it's breakthrough and can make it big. This is a rare sequel and a gem of a film. It's not for kids alone, they have company and the adults will love it. It's dark and yet humorous. I loved it and hopefully you will too. A 4/5 for this.",8,4,12,17 August 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Stylishly made fun film that is engrossing every moment.
","Stylishly made fun film that is engrossing every moment.It surprises for a good part of the film and that's the best part. From the time we enter the Budapest Hotel, it is an fun ride, the characters are interesting and have their own little stories that are comical yet emotional and thoughtful.The story of lobby boy (Zero Mustafe) or that of Gustave, or of any character, they are not very great to say the least but are interesting. They all together shape up this well made set piece that is mostly confined to the setting of the Hotel. The acting by Ralph Fiennes is a treat and Tony Revolori as the lobby boy is a revelation. The interesting part of the film I found was the use of varied aspect ratio. It differentiates the time frames intelligently. Wes Anderson is a director who oozes out fun in his films. His films are more about fun and the camaraderie between the characters. The shots are slick, the art direction is generally awesome and the cinematography is superb. The film is very appealing visually and all his films thus far have been stylish. There is enough substance in this fun story There is action, chase, fight, enough drama and even suspense. It's all well stitched and made the whole film an engaging experience. Of course, the script is the hero followed by superb art direction of the hotel.I am not sure, if this was shot on location or whether they erected a set, but it was just beautiful. The hotel, interiors, the painting of the exteriors and even the locales. This film shall be a 4/5 for the acting and the art direction alone. Thanks to Wes Anderson for giving us a good time at the movies yet again.",8,3,5,23 August 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," An epic film that deserves an epic viewing.
","An epic film that deserves an epic viewing.A film that's 228 minutes that is 3 hours and 48 minutes longs should have been exhausting. But this one is endearing and thus deservedly has been one of the greatest films ever made. To understand this film and appreciate it more than just the film, one would better be acquainted with the history. It has a great history behind the story. Though, there are few factual manipulations to include more drama, the whole experience of viewing this, is rewarding. It's rewarding to know that such a person existed who fought a war merely on the basis of humanity. He was completely impartial and non-judgmental. This was based on World War 1, now when we compare to films made on World War 1, with those made about World War 2, I found that they are very few in number. But this one stands above all other films that are based on World War 2. David Lean, the master behind the making of this film, shows his efforts in every frame of it. Indeed, he builds a whole world for the camera and it has great beauty in each shot. Each angle, each move is just so detailed and precise that it's tough to find fault in any frame. From the sun rise in the Arabian desert to the landscapes filled with sand dunes. From battles to closed door discussions, there is a certain magnanimity to each frame. The grandeur can be attributed partly to the choice of shooting of the film 70mm cinema scope (Super Panavision 70). For me the greatness would go to the director David Lean and to the cinematographer F A Young. Peter O Toole perhaps, was remembered as Lawrence more than his own name. Such was the impact of his character and his depiction was pitch perfect in every aspect. Peter showcased equanimity while there was war being shown, or while grappling with his own emotional internal conflict. War is brutal but more brutal is the war within. In a war of arms, you are killed for once. But in an emotional war, each moment is deathly. Peter showcased a rare poise and I am certain the whole film experience could have been so exhausting that he would have considered it an experience of a life time that more worthy than life itself.Amongst other things, I liked the music which was given by Maurice Jarre. The music was right up there and in such a long movie, music was very much needed to keep the emotional quotient. The music had the much needed variation. Be it the English war themes, or one to amplify Arabian desert sounds or even Arabian traditional music or the pathos of Lawrence too. There was a music needed for every bit and it was there all over the place. Never I felt it was over the board or too loud, it was just right. All the actors have done a commendable job. Above all others, I loved Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal and Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali. Thanks to David Lean and the producers of this epic. It's one of the most courageous decision of all those involved in the making and thankfully it paid great dividends in terms of awards and rewards. A definite 5/5 for an epic of a film.",10,1,4,2 July 2014
City of God," A very very terrific Brazilian film that is completely raw in characters, language and depiction.
","A very very terrific Brazilian film that is completely raw in characters, language and depiction.This is a crime movie about the hoodlums in Brazil and the drug mafia and the background of each case. How gangs form, how they get lost, are killed, what fate do they give to future and all that you cannot even imagine at times. This is the most raw film I ever saw and I can smell everything from the streets stinking to the perfume of the girl to the drugs taken. It's so very well taken that I even forgot all this was done by a camera. So fluid is the movie and hats off to the cinematographer, the art director and the director.Written extremely tightly and completely driven by various characters and is narrated by Rocket, our protagonist who is an observer, yes he is a cameraman in the movie and captures all he could about the mafia. Each character takes the story forward and each scene just keeps you as engrossed as the earlier one. There is no one frame that could have been cut in this extremely well edited movie. It's a rarity to see all things knit well up in this movie and I appreciate and would yearn for more such movies. The milieu, the slang, the topography all are so well compiled and choreographed. And to bring all this together, I would hail the director Fernando Meirelles who has brought raw energy into a film and makes it extremely powerful and in fact the most powerful movie for generations to come.This is a movie that one must quickly watch it. I cannot exactly tell what I liked coz I liked everything and this again is a must experience movie.Thanks Fernando extremely grateful for giving such a great movie.It's 5/5 and is a must see movie.",10,0,2,20 September 2014

","It's a brilliant film and one of the most cynical films made on marriage.Marriage is one of the most toughest bonds of human race. To sustain that thread despite all it's finesse and yet it's shambles, there is always an inherent fear that a small knife may cut the whole thread. Marriage is one of the finest threads that was ever made, Now to go to any extent in marriage is also possible, but does any sane marriage involve self-murder, no and I can say that's almost impossible. All married ones beware before you watch this and those anticipating marriage, think again of the one whom you are going to marry. Marriage or rather a relationship with the person we love is going to thought through after seeing this in a theater, I bet you.Impossible is nothing for this director David Fincher who has made mind boggling films like FIGHT CLUB. He turns a simple story head on, adds a flavor that's so spicy that you may love it or hate but you just can't ignore it. He gives similar treatment to this film. You start understanding and decoding the story, it becomes something and then after few minutes if you think you have almost sorted it out, then again it transpires into something else. It's a tough one to call and I can only say, this is mind boggling stuff. Fincher is one of the few directors who can direct the film in a way that is deeply interesting and yet there are many layers involved into it. This is a very layered movie, like an onion as the layers are peeled, we seem to get to the core, but this is something more surprising, the moment we think we got it, we would have lost it. It tests the intelligence of the viewer and that's how this film has won hearts. I can safely say, this is one of the very intelligent movies that has come in recent times. I have not seen much of Rosamund Pike who plays Amy Dunne in this film but she is the true protagonist who drove the story all by herself. Just her portrayal as Amy has made her one of the finest actresses of this year. The rest of the cast has done a good job too.A 4/5 for a must watch film and I request this has to be seen in theaters, let the naked truth be told brutally if need be.",8,3,7,8 September 2015
Django Unchained," I am missing the Tarantino in this, I loved in earlier films.
","I am missing the Tarantino in this, I loved in earlier films.Except for a the gun-fire that opens up to eliminate all possible misdeeds, and people who did a thing with a purpose, there was no much fun in this. It is a Sphagetti western film based in 1850's but it seemed so flawed that I was not so sure, if there were such cool goggles, guns and was the ride so easy to Mississippi. Yes Tarantino took liberties in showing everything from style to substance is what mislead the whole film. Maybe my problem is I expected too much out this, just trusting the ability and the genius of Tarantino. But he has disappointed me this time. And worse is it is overlong and is nearly 3 hours. Hey, Quentin what got into you man, you made a satire of a Sphagetti and not a tribute.Yes, I sincerely think this is more of a satire than a tribute. Look at the way the whole plan is chalked out, the way the music plays in background. King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz is the one to whom this whole film belongs to. Once he is dead, it was just an extension to make Django the hero in the latter half hour and that was not what I wanted. For me, Django is one in many, he would better be that. He is never shown to have a brain of his own, coz he is lead and dictated by Schultz for most time. Once Schultz is no more, he takes the mantel onto himself and destroys the whole of it. Wow, what does that mean now, for me it meant nothing much. Is such bloodshed, such a journey all for a wife, who could have been given may be by the wisdom of Schultz who was shown to have a wisdom of a very high altitude. The look, the style, the cinematography were well in place, but the heart was clearly missing. It's neither soulful nor so dead that there is no life in it. It's very much alive just that it's not so interesting as other movies from the same creator and that'w what my whole crib is about. Mundane is rather be a harsh word to say for such a western film, but its surely simplified story with eccentric characters and dialogues. Django by Jamie Foxx, is one of the weakest characters in the film and yet surprisingly the whole film is about him. Samuel Jackson as Stephen is a complete surprise package from looks to dialogues. Leanardo Dicaprio as Calvin Candie, the villain of the film is cunning just as needed to the script. Yet, Leanardo was not yet unleashed to the full potential as he should have been. Now, Chirstoph Waltz as Shultz makes the film his own, by displaying an array of cold bloodedness and makes the film his own. Despite, the presence of the other actors, Waltz shines and wow, I just loved him in this. Editing could have been taken care very well. Seriously, at least one hour could have been curtailed down. Taranatino, you mislead me this time and for next time, please make a much better one place. A 2/5 for an good film made as an average flick by one of the master directors alive.",4,4,7,8 September 2014
2012," Strictly Below Average
","The world is at its end, it's doomsday everything is going to go down in the sea, hey wait, did I say everything no there will be a lucky few who will survive the meteors falling and the earth crashing and all, the logic of the doom is fine and scientific. But someone being made hero for the sake of it is not appreciable.The special effects are not over the moon but yes watchable but are they worth all the millions put in? I doubt that and think that I saw many better movies which were made in lower budgets and yes were more captivating than all the content that is thrown at in this film. Just see if you think that the promos and ads pull you into theatre else you can make a miss and nothing would change or matter.Strictly Below Average - 1/5",2,0,2,20 September 2014
The Lives of Others," You can sacrifice anything but yourself and your love and love filled with guilt is better to be dead.
","You can sacrifice anything but yourself and your love and love filled with guilt is better to be dead.The theme of the movie is complex to construe coz it has many layers, its very humane as a theme and brings very gross realities as a human being. Setup in the 1980's Germany where it was still divided and it was in East Germany about an artist couple, a writer and an actress being watched over by the Stasi, by HGW XX/7 the code name of the Policeman who wil note the records of what the couple does all through. This policeman played by Ulrich Muhe is the protagonist of the film. Now, the whole movie drives with his writings, his listenings and what he makes out of them. Truth is kept alive by this man and that is what he lives for, for truth. Now, few movies have a very engrossing screenplay from first frame and this one has it and deservingly is one of the best films in terms of story and screenplay, the direction is so well done that never for a slightest moment did I feel that something was out of place or it is uncalled for, everything went as per the script which is the true hero. There are no aberrations as such as each character is etched out superbly. You cannot write characters as black and white coz there is a flaw in each and that's what is shown. It's one of the few films that is supremely human and music too has it's own place to bring out humanity, like reference of Lenin's quote on Betthoven's symphony. Watch it to know it, I cannot comprehend in mere words what this film is. One of the superb films in recent times. I make it 5/5.",10,3,5,20 September 2014
Good Will Hunting," My Seek Solace Film
","My seek solace movie of all time. This is great and it has been working for me for over 10 years now.I saw it first time in college and in last 10 years numerous number of times and it gave me an inspiration always. Now what kind of an inspiration, this differs each time. Now, I am angry with myself and upset because one of my scripts was rejected by my director (rather he said politely, let's make this one later) . So I had to get back to this spirit lifting film and again it made me rise from the pitfall and made me stand erect. This is a kinda of film that is rare, it's about friendship one can say, it's about knowing oneself someone else may say, but it's great anyway you look at it.The simplest question 'What do you want to do?' is the toughest one to answer. At times, we need someone to help us along with that question.Here Will is helped by Sean. The movie works for it's writing and acting by all. Moreover, the way it is directed, makes it completely authentic and believable Will Hunting (Matt Damon) does not exist in many, there are a few and yet he can be related to, we all have talents but we need direction.We need someone to say. Son, go do it and that's what precisely Sean (Robin Williams) does with Will. Written by to brains, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, this is for sure a great script by those then youngsters but I need it needed direction and that's what Gus Van Sant did to this. Look at the scene at the end where the car just goes away and keeps going away, tells us that this movie is something else from the commercial rot. This has got great dialog to match it up with and well, the cinematography is commendable. Well, acting by Robin Williams is worth a mention, because he did take the whole role to a new level. Just take that 'Fart Scene' where he confesses his wife used Fart is something that can make anyone into splits with a subdued amount of tears because there is tragedy involved.Also, I can relate Sean to my good brother 'Vinay Anna' whom I have met over a year and made a great bond with. He is a man, who used to tell me 'Just do, what you want to do, we will for sure back you up' His words, made me pursue what I believe in, and I am still doing it. I have no crib whatsoever with any technical department be it art direction, production design, music, editing or even costumes. They are simply great as they are very apt for this movie. All the 5 thumbs up for this 5/5 movie. Will get back to this many a time, just hoping, I will neither be angry or down going forward when I watch it again.",10,2,5,24 November 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The adventure is poised and rightly so gets more fascinating.
","The adventure is poised and rightly so gets more fascinating.This is the second film of the trilogy and adds up more elements to the story. There are newer characters and few old ones seem to have been rested, for good. Yet, the fascination does not stop and it gets more engaging with this one.I am actually happy revisiting these films as I seem to understand more points about the story than I did earlier. I cannot put them here and become a spoiler as I am an ardent fan of the Lord of the Rings. Rather, I can say that everyone must see why this is one of the finest fantasies brought alive on celluloid.The fellowship of the earlier film is split and yet each one is in the same pursuit. Their ways are different now, but the goal is still the same. The characterizations are still consistent and it makes it easier to understand the intention of each one. Also, it makes the story all the more fascinating.I love the technical aspects of the film, and that's one of the very reasons why this fantasy is highly appreciated. The visuals, the sound, the whole landscape. It seems so unreal and yet is so very connected. Peter Jackson is a genius who brought the whole middle earth in front of our eyes and yet everything seems like it existed at one point of time in reality. Also, he knows when to end and what to do with the material at hand. That's where his genius is. This film takes off from a good point and lands at a very wonderful point, making us more eager to be on the next adventure.It's a 5/5 for this one and is one of the greatest films and adventures ever.",10,0,2,8 September 2016
Schindler's List," A masterpiece that is profoundly humane and indeed tragic yet hopeful.
","A masterpiece that is profoundly humane and indeed tragic yet hopeful.'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.'I finally made it, I cannot ever see the whole picture at once for it's brutality that was displayed, but yesterday night I did it gone through the film at length and just took a water break and the 3 hour long saga made me cry even an hour after it was ever. I am emotional and certainly have deep feelings, I cam to restore them again with very film. It made an impact and it re emphasised the value of the life a human, I know what a loss means, I have gone through that, I just can't bear any untimely losses anymore. Here, they are organising a crime of execution of poor souls.I wrote the film is in English, though 40% of it is German and Polish.It's about Oskar Schindler, a Nazi man man who saved more than 1100 Jews from the holocaust of the German Army. 6 million Jews were killed them can you imagine how much it is, 6000000. That is, a whole race was being eliminated and this man stood up against all odds, and saved 1100 of those. Now, this did happen and Oskar Schindler is one of the few heroes who must be revered for what he done to Jew community specifically and to humanity at large. I can say that I am now happy to be reviewing a masterpiece that shows a world of a different kind, a world that I never knew of, but it happened to exist in the world ward 2 under Hitler's regime. A world where they call you names, just to kill you, where people are not afraid to be dead either. This was what Taliban had did to those in Afghanistan.Now cinematically it's flawless, it's 3 hours but no editing is needed, any cut would demean the value of a life of a Jew, it's best the way it is, cinematography, sound, music, set design and art direction are sublime. Now, what' great is you have nearly thirty thousand people working on a film and they themselves make a world that is real in every sense. The actors everyone of them is just so real. We watch history and many epic films but this one is something else. It is by far the greatest documentary made on war. I cannot say anything about the genius of Spielberg, I am no worth even to utter a word of single word of praise. About the film, I can say this much, you might not like to watch it many times, but if you did it once, it's highly unlikely to forget anything about this film. By the way, I loved Itzhak Stern played by Ben Kingsley, he is more a hero here than anyone else. It's not about applauding the team for such a masterpiece, it's about thanking them for what they have done to humanity by depicting history the way it was. They brought us a story that teaches us value of a life, what more can you ask. I am speechless and even a 5/5 rating seems so less, to this masterpiece.Ah, it's aching me even now as I write this in the joy of pain. Salutauions to the heroes who have saved lives and our only little tribute we can give them is by knowing their story, so please watch this film.Those, who have seen this, they may better know where it comes. For those who have not, here is a scene from the ending of the film.",10,9,13,19 September 2014
School of Rock," If there was an inspirational rock movie then here it is.
","If there was an inspirational rock movie then here it is. All through my engineering that is from 2004 October (when I first saw) till the end of my studies and even today, this movie inspires me with its flamboyance of the JUST DO IT spirit. It's a well written tale and extremely well directed. To take this screenplay and bringing it to life and to extract such great acting from the kids is a serious director's job and kudos to Linklater for having done that so well.It's a tribute to all those rock bands that have inspired over the years and this movie played a big part for my introduction to Rock music. A bunch of school guys form a band with the help of their teacher. Rather the teacher forms a band with help of school kids assigning them a job and its their journey from becoming a band to making songs. Passionate is how I would say the acting of Jack Black was as he lead the film all through bearing the weight solely on his shoulders.There was no big star cast except him in the movie and this modest film budget did not allow the movie to explore may be. However, this movie is extremely well made in all departments. Production deign, editing must be given appreciation. editor for sure would have had a major job to have the unwanted and unnecessary things out. The music selection is also top notch with apt songs coming at the right time.It's 4/5 for one of the best musical movies ever.",8,9,9,20 September 2014
Gran Torino," What is life for, if death is not worthy enough.
","What is life for, if death is not worthy enough. And salute those who live in the hearts of others whose lives are touched by the grace of a good human.We all live as morons more or less and even I lived like one for better part of my life and now I but now I aspire Clint Eastwood. He made this film at 78 and it does have the strength and shows the guts of this man. Powerful is word that might undermine the strength and the impact it may have on audience. I now see a reason for this film being rated high by many. Coz I just the saw film and felt awestruck. Few are films that make you believe that at times sacrifice is worth. Gran Torino is precisely that. I am such a selfish human that I put myself above everybody else. I seek my own happiness and do not care about others much. Now, this film touched me also and put my prejudices towards sacrifice into question. This film does dare to do something detailed in establishing love and then dares to hurry the climax and the film seems to have ended too soon, The climax compensates all the lost where I have felt as to where is all this going. It comes to a wonderful end, albeit tragic, it raises thoughts and ask questions about the purpose of existence itself. You may be theist, atheist, agnostic or anything but above all you are human being. Being human in itself is great responsibility but the tragic part is very few understand that and even among these very very few people heed to that. In such times, this gentleman called Matt Kowalski played superbly by Clint Eastwood stands tall for his neighbors. There is a point where he realizes that he does not love his own family as much as he loves his neighbors. Now, when you love somebody, you need to show when the time comes. He does not show up his love, but he does much more than that. OK, now the film is named as Gran Torino which is a car model. Why is the film named after a car, when it''s not a car race nor an automobile related movie. Coz, the car acts as a protagonist in itself by taking the movie forward. The car brings Thao and Walt together. Now, Thao is a Hmong American who is the neighbor of Walt Kowalski too. So, I better not reveal much about them. I saw this and I am indebted to Clint Eastwood for giving me this. It's not all flawless and great. Though it has it's own share of flaws, the goodness covers all of them. It's a 4/5 for this film.",8,0,2,7 September 2014
The Illusionist," The lighting scheme and art direction are just top of the world in this film.
","The lighting scheme and art direction are just top of the world in this film. The cinematography is apt and so are other departments but the way the light is used has to be well appreciated.It's a period film on an illusionist and his love story and is brought out compellingly as any good writer director does. But what's interesting is the point of view. All the while when we presume that it's based on what the illusionist perceives, it's also what people around him think. Acting by Edward Norton as Illusionist is worth a mention. This is a great story interlaced with a good screenplay combined with fine acting and setup exquisitely beautiful. So we have a winner as a film aficionados and I loved this for all this.The climax where he brings back his own past, did mesmerize me just as it did to all the audience withing the film. Yes, he performs shows and shows illusions, some are just unbelievable. It is engrossing for sure but has a few lapses with long scenes like the one where the illusionist is grilled. All said and done, I recommend this movie for those who want a fantasy film that has mysticism embedded just to enthrall us to a very good amount of time. I will got with 4/5 for this one.",8,1,1,20 September 2014
Kelly's Heroes," Meticulous planning and execution leads to a successful treasure.
","Meticulous planning and execution leads to a successful treasure.In life too, if we plan and execute meticulously, we shall end up with a treasure that's worth more than our own anticipation That's a life lesson to be learned from this. Now, the film is comical and I am surprised that an end to end war film that is devoid of any politics can be so hilarious. I am more so surprised about the dialogs and their delivery. Writing is exceptional but the acting is much more substantial than the writing. Those lines could have been bland, if not expressed well.Clint Eastwood as Kelly stands out and the other one for me was Donald Sutherland as Sergeant Oddball. These are the most memorable performances of this film.Technically, this is brilliant, the war seems real and the plot is inspiring in itself. Money drives the soldiers into greed and makes them heroes for their country too. There is an irony that's worth appreciating in the film.This film is a proper commercial war film, that has songs, action, emotion, humor and above all war. It ticks off the word go and takes us through interesting turns to a happy destiny. I am all for such interesting bumpy rides and this film was that one.Thanks to director, Brian G Hutton who made another wonderful film WHERE EAGLES DARE prior to this one.A 4/5 for one of the most hilarious war films you may ever see.",8,4,7,8 September 2015
Jurassic World," Strictly a one time watch and even if avoided or missed out then no big deal.
","Strictly a one time watch and even if avoided or missed out then no big deal.Let me begin by talking about the theater where we watched this film. It's Grand Cinema in Hong Kong, where the seats vibrate in sync with the surround effect. This experience was new for me and it was certainly immersive. This film certainly had great sound effects so the vibration of seats was a good one to experience.Coming to the film, there is no value add I got, apart from better visual and sound effects than the classic and original Jurassic Park made in 1993. I simply think that this film was over rated by my friends who went gaga over this and recommended this.Irfan Khan surprised me in this with the role he had played. Apart from that there anything much impressive about this film. There is that oomph factor for sure but not not to my satisfaction.Technically, yes this all the ingredients of a superbly designed film with adequate effects. I wish there was some soul too and not just a body that was camouflaged.An average 2/5 for this.",4,7,17,8 September 2015
The Dark Knight," Watch it please just for JOKER
","It's a Batman film that is derived as imminently as any other comic book movie but what is brought in here is a maverick who has all the madness to fight and that's the joker. And as aptly a dialogue 'This is what happens when an unstoppable force is hit by an immovable object' and thus Dark Knight happens. It is surely the most entertaining movies I had watched all of 2008 and even when I did it now, it's as enthralling as ever and when ever I saw Joker I was happy happy and happy, I want to be the JOKER the ruthless criminal who wants not money not power but fun. The screenplay is terrific as an Christopher Nolan's movie and the music is stupendous by Hans Zimmer but all and above it's Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker that has brought in the entertainment factor into the movie. Yes, he was taken for granted too by other characters but when he unleashes himself it's so terrifying. Confrontation with Batman when he says, You complete me or what will I do without you, you are so much fun is ah, a great one. Another one with Harvey Dent in hospital where the two faced is shown, must appreciate the make up for that, it's just so horrifying for a moment and there too the Joker says Do you think I am one of those, a schemer again a ooh. Watch it please just for JOKER. It's 5/5.",10,0,1,13 November 2011
Annie Hall," It's easily one of the most comical Woody Allen Films and almost everyone's favourite and very understandably so.
","It's easily one of the most comical Woody Allen Films and almost everyone's favourite and very understandably so.I have seen this earlier and now I watched it again today, just to review it and when you look at a movie you will see it completely and observe each detail. So now, I loved the experience more than ever. Woody Allen made movie before this and after this, but this stands as his own in every which way. This is where he began, coming to his own and showing us a film grammar that many of us were not acquainted with.It's the relationship between Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) an Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) that the film is all about and how they stick together and even move on in different paths. Now, it's a relation of a middle aged couple in their forties and yet it's so innovative that they behave much worse than even teenagers today. They are immature, innocent, indulgent and running for their own egos making up their own reasons. It's all funny and so very innovative too. Woody Allen makes us audience indulge into the film by talking to them too. It's those long monologues or those fast paced and stammering dialogues, and those intelligent innuendos. The 'Death In Venice' dialogue was a great one to laugh at. And there are so many too, I don't want to reveal them all here please. It's fun to watch them and laugh at them. Two superb performances, with great editing work done and superb dialogues and brilliant direction that is what makes it a masterpiece. There is a lot of incoherence and yet it's very very good indeed. Diane Keaton and Woody Allen are funny and cute while others have supported well. Look at the way Woody Allen asks the people in the film asking question on road side and that's a thing only he can do, salutations to Allen again and again and again.It's a 5/5 for not so perfect film but it's one that will stay in the memory for long time an it will get you back to it for it's dialogue and for the Allenish touch. It may work for you, if you like romance as it is.",10,1,2,19 September 2014
Blood Diamond," A powerful film on the diamond trade and exploitation of people in Africa.
","A powerful film on the diamond trade and exploitation of people in Africa.This is a film based on True Events and is made realistically. The film's strong points are writing, directing and acting. This film seems to be shot in real locations with real people. There are many points in the film which I liked technically. The shot composition, the capture of African Landscape is amazing. The music is something I liked and felt it went with the flow of the film.The writing of dialogues is simple and yet stood out. The relationship between 'Danny Archer' (Leonardo DiCaprio) and 'Solomon Vandy' (Djimon Hounsou) is well established and concluded beautifully.In 2006, there were two memorable films which came out about exploitation in Africa. One is this one and the other is 'Last King of Scotland'. While both are historical films and based on True Events, I thought 'Blood Diamond' was better in drama.I loved the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio and he was terrific in the role. Watch it if you are a Leo fan, or if interested in the history of Africa. Others, watch if interested in good cinema.A 3/5 for a good film.",6,1,1,18 September 2016
The Graduate," A good movie but very overrated I think
","'Mrs. Robinson, you are trying to seduce me aren't you?' Isn't this a clichéd dialog. Yes it is very clichéd but not in the context of movie, where it seems apt and fluid. It's a great example how simple things can be made interesting. It's the way we narrate a story makes it interesting and that's what directors or few audience call it as TREATMENT. So watch this out for treatment more than anything else. In times such as 1967, where world was grooving in Hippies and Rock music began with Beatles and few other bands, comes this satirical movie that questions the society. This movie has no dope, no rock music and no hippie stuff. It's about a mundane boy and his teenage thoughts. He is apprehensive about sleeping with a woman much elder to his age and yet falls into the temptation of her. Now, the point is he has to marry her daughter and make her fall in love for him. So that's where the movie is going to go.Is it right to fall into temptations and also fall into love with a daughter of the temptation? Ah, unacceptable still for those tradition lovers but again the context has been put so finely well that rather than questioning more, it's better to give in to the character's state of thinking at that time. Yet, this is not a perennially contemporary that will be embraced at any time you watch it. In 1967 people would have loved it as they are watching such a taboo issue being dealt for first time. In 2012 that is 45 years later, many would have seen such movies or such issues being held in a much more interesting way. At least no this this clichéd. There is a subtext to the character and a relevance of simplicity and that's why I liked it. The costumes just complement the vision and so is an emphatic sound design and oh, did I miss the music by Simon and Garfunkel that is apt and perfect and has a character to it, when the song Mrs. Robinson comes up. The performances are fine and Dustin Hoffman as Graduate plays it supremely well. All said and above is the writing that makes it a story worth watching and being compelled to. I liked it for most part except a silly ending of running away, yet there is an inherent meaning to it conveyed only in expressions. I would with 3/5 that is so very important and is yet a taboo is our society. Not sure, how may may like it as it is, yet I liked it.",6,0,1,27 May 2012
Singin' in the Rain," So a musical movie with comic drama in it oh, I loved it.
","So a musical movie with comic drama in it oh, I loved it.The Artist, a film that I now believe is hugely inspired from Singin In The Rain, has won the best film Oscar while this film was not even nominated as best film. That shows, how are we going down in providing quality films. The plot is pretty simple of introducing sound into movies. Its periodic and is yet so flamboyant with tap dances, music and love making space to make it a true musical. Music is what made this movie so very typical and outstanding, it's characters are so stereotypical and yet so humorous thats its so very easy to fall in love with. Performances by each one is just so clean and engaging but Gene Kelly has provided an outstanding performance as Don Lockwood. Plot is simple but the way it was made will make anyone just be happy, there are no twists here, but there is beauty in the simple things that we see. The voice being dubbed, the introduction of microphone, each things makes a scene either cynical or comical and without taking anything overboard. Yes, there are too many songs and dances and yet I loved most of them, coz they are so very real. Anyone would love Singing something In the Rain as Rain in itself is a romantic phenomenon and love sprouts from deep within at such times, I loved this film for its songs, its performances and just for making me feel so happy. Technically, its cinematography, its editing lack their slick which we see these days, but its too very detailed in terms of dialogue and art direction, so it gives us the space to fall in love with it.Recommended for sure, it's 4/5 for one of the best musicals ever.",8,0,1,19 September 2014
Alice in Wonderland," A wonderland that is dreamy and funny and simply wonderful. A trip that we take on in dreams.
","A wonderland that is dreamy and funny and simply wonderful. A trip that we take on in dreams.Alice has a dream and the whole story is a familiar story for most who have known it since childhood. But never have I seen it come off so wonderfully with exquisite costumes, art direction and the graphics that are so intrinsic. Once you have the whole feel of it, then each characters come across with a panache that is their own, be it a stalwart like Johnny Depp or a Anne Hathaway, all take the story forward in a way that is so engaging and also enticing. The music took me in and was fantastic, it was aptly creepy at most times and it was thrilling too as the trip went on. The finale music is just a great one though the finale fell short of lot of my visual expectations. I must say the movie got dragged right when Alice met White Queen and since it started to loosen a grip on a suspense thriller it held to for thus long.All performances were very very engaging and they all induced a character of their own and this appreciation goes to Burton for extracting such performances. Burtonish and Johnny Deppish. It's 3/5. It is good for now but surely could have been a Wow had the finale been better and the movie been shorter.",6,1,1,20 September 2014

What is it about?It's in a way story of person saving his race and fighting for it. He wants love, he wants trust. But never did I feel that it was told splendidly as it was done in AVATAR. When a guy who has lost his legs jumps in joy we feel man I would have done that too. When a person with his courage has won the trust of many and feels to lose it then he would do anything to get it back. Each nuance was stunning and oozing in beauty and splendor. A new world PANDORRA has been created and AVATAR makes you feel right there, you can touch those ferns, those plants, those wild animals (or monsters, I can't term them). The screenplay is perfect with each new scene revealing something new and by the end we can figure out what each thing was all about.A scene, in which the lead couple takes a ride and explores PANDORRA, is just one example of beauty that this movie has. The editing is awesome and the acting is apt. The background music, (I concentrated the least as the visuals were too very stunning) is just perfect. But hey, it's not a movie where all these things should be looked into. Just sit in a 3D thing put your goggles and see for the first few minutes after the time would just flew.Kudos, to James Cameron for visualizing AVATAR all in the brain and his crew who meticulously draw translated his vision to screen. It's surely worth the time it took in making and for me it's worth every penny and every second I spent watching it.It's not a must see but a must experience movie. 5/5",10,3,5,20 September 2014
The Artist," A silent spectacle. One of the toughest films in recent times.
","A silent spectacle. One of the toughest films in recent times.Right from the first frame, it engrossed me, pulled me into it, made me laugh at it and also made me think at times, without even a word being uttered on screen. Sheer beauty and exquisitely performed by the artists. It's a highly appreciable thing that audiences have embraced this film but what is more appreciable is the fact that there are people who would still love to make such movies. It's the same wine in new bottle, just that it caters to tast of the new audience which is 'said to be intelligent'.A simple conflict of whether an artist likes sound in movies or not, is drawn to magnanimous proportions and one scene where the glass sound, the laughs of girls come along portray how much he is stuck and in love with silence. He is overtly adamant about silent films than being passionate about them. He hates the sound so much that he goes to even end his life, on hearing people speak. Such a character is tough to portray and Jean Dujardin does emote exceptionally well. The dog named Uggy who is the hero and as written in the film, 'He owes his life to the dog' has done a remarkably good job. The art direction was outstanding and so was the choreography. The music complemented each scene well whether it is the initial part of cinema where he performs for audiences, the comic sequences or the dramatic part. Also, the screenplay just flew. Having said all the above, there are a few dislikes of which few are 1) This film has a completely predictable storyline, in fact me and my friend were talking to each other what would happen next and it turned out to be same 2) The story in itself is too very common and so is the treatment 3) The actress Berenice Bejo was good at places and at few times was just awkward, example the way she speaks to George Valentin on the stairs was like making a spoof of the old silent films. 4) Oh yes, its just too melodramatic, the final climax where she rushes in car as if she would definitely do an accident was uncalled for.So going out with 3/5. Having said about the flaws, I would still say it's a must watch for those who love cinema for the way cinema is. I loved it, coz I go for cinema to be taken into it and pulls me into a path that it builds for me, and this movie did that in every sense to me. This is for sure, is the best actor movie I saw in recent times.",6,1,3,20 September 2014
3 Idiots," It's good in parts but Okay as a whole.
","It's good in parts but Okay as a whole. Aamir Khan this time comes up as an engineering student and does it not so convincingly. He seemed to have been through college not once but many times over, as he started telling 'Say your heart All is Well and things will fall into place'.The movie is about giving freedom to kids and a message to parents, let them be what they want to be do not enforce things on them. This is conveyed in a light sense and in a comical way. Yet, at times it becomes preachy, like the confrontation of Rancho with Virus where Rancho says 'Yeh Marks mere ko samajh aaye hi nahi' and yet not at many other times. It is a parody of itself take the black and white scenes of Raju's family or the scene of Chatur Lingam where he says that after 5 years lets see who will be where. But the good moments are far and only between as a few drizzles in a tropic summer.The cinematography is good only in parts. Like aerial shots of Shimla road and Ladakh scenes otherwise it was just good. The art designing is commendable with the look of college, hostel and other things done well. The editing was not precise as I thought there are lot of things that could have been cut out like the pregnancy sequence in climax. The casting was not apt except Boman Irani as Principal, Chatur Lingam guy the others were clearly not apt. The 3 main protagonists and the heroine were clearly a misfit as none seemed to be students. Acting was average as nothing was so great and so original as if it was never seen. Chatur Lingam was the silver lightning in the otherwise dry acting. Also to mention is Boman Irani as principal.The writing was mediocre as their previous ones were well written and witty Munnabhai movies. And this was an adaptation of Five Point Someone having read that, I can say that the whole backdrop and the characters and only a few situations were picked but the point that was told was different from the book. That book is much worse than this movie. I am not detailing any instances as mostly, I found them silly and stupid.And in parts, hardly a couple, the originality came out. The speech by Chatur Lingam is the saving grace otherwise it was merely pathetic but such instances took it to at least average level.All is surely not well and it's strictly Average - 2/5.",4,5,16,20 September 2014
Life Is Beautiful," A wonderful Tragicomedy on the most inhuman act of 20th century, the Holocaust of Jews.
","A wonderful Tragicomedy on the most inhuman act of 20th century, the Holocaust of Jews.How far can you go for your family is what the apt tag line will be for this film. From protecting the wife from inhuman creatures to protecting the innocence of his only son, Guido Orefice does it all for his family and even sacrifices his whole life for them.Roberto Benigni is affable as Guido, a wonderful human being who knows to take everything with a sense of humor. There are turbulent times, the world has changed for him, he is put in the most awful circumstances, even he is caught and will be executed. In all the places, all he does is smile. It's heartening to see a man go through dire circumstances with liveliness and smile. But that tragedy that is to come is fatal and that's where hearts melt for the audience. A happy family is shattered for no fault of their own. In the second world war, Jews were condemned as sinners and executed, it's on of the most insane things ever done, on this planet. Hitler will never be forgive for his sins for centuries. The story is simple, the portrayal is wonderful, the art direction is superb and the other aspects are right. The 2 hours are fun for the first half and heart rending in the second. But all is well in the end. This film is simply beautiful.Loved Roberto Benigni, his wife Nicoletta Braschi (she played Dora, the wife of Guido) and Giorgio Cantarini (he played the role of 5 year old Joshua, son of Guido). The other performances were wonderful too.There is not a frame or scene that's boring or out of place. This film deserves a 5/5. Humanity means something, see this to know that. It's all about bringing smiles to others.",10,1,1,23 August 2014
Up," It's a must take adventure. Go UP and UP and UP!!!
","It's a must take adventure. Go UP and UP and UP!!!I watched it in theatre in Pune in 2009 and revisited this today and wow, still so nice and fun it is. The first 15 minutes made my heart melt and the last 15 minutes made my heart pound and race. Wow, what an adventure it was. It was more about a bird named Kevin than about the old man Fredricksen. As any pixar movie which have been released till TOY STORY 3, this is simply atop in terms of animation and story telling, they just weave animation into great stories and create movies that are much better than most. Yes, it's memorable and still we would dive into the adventures more as we go and see them. UP for sure is one such cinema though it may be a bit uncharacteristic as most other PIXAR films did not have humans as their protagonists. Here, we have an old man who wants to go to see a place called paradise falls just that he wants to end his trip of life by fulfilling the last wish of his wife that is to see paradise falls. He is joined by the wilderness explorer Russell and the cute dog named DUG. These guys join in together and form a team to accomplish there mission of paradise falls and to save the bird Kevin. But, save Kevin from what and why? Hmm, just go and fin out in this beautiful piece of cinema that for sure is going to make you please, given that you like good animated cinema.All is great, the details are remarkable and the story is spell binding, in fact it's just a trip. Kudos once again to the great team of PIXAR who have made us joyful yet again in cinemas. If you have not seen in theatres, that's OK, get a DVD or better a BLU RAY and have fun. Everything is just right in this film. Having said that, if you have watched many PIXAR or animated films, you might have predicted early itself what PIXAR has go to offer, so that's the only thing we need to think about. Yet, as a good cinema fan, I would give this 5/5. Another 5/5 to a PIXAR movie and they keep making me happier each time I get back to their films.Thanks to PIXAR team for this adventure.",10,0,1,19 September 2014
Rio," Fly Love. Fly Rio. The same flying tale told charmingly.
","Fly Love. Fly Rio. The same flying tale told charmingly.Yes, they seem to be inspired by PIXAR in animation and content too. PIXAR uses toys, cars, rats, monsters and these folks used birds. The content is simple, a bird has to find her home and has to get what it was deprived of, and that is it's flight. Not revealing too much of a story here but yes, it's worth a trip and I am sure that for most part we will be laughing on gags that we have seen earlier. What I think, they did is they took all the famous acts amalgamated them well and the concoction they ensured that was prepared was sweet.Like one scene, where when the guy tries to drive a bike, he hits the wall and fell off while the girl starts it they fly in the air. A few scenes like the one in which Blue (our protagonist) reads books on how to fly and then prepares itself to takeoff creating a runway as if its an airplane. All these bring out laughs and make us happy. So surely this can be taken a ride for such moments that are many.There is nothing as such jaw dropping or mind boggling in this animated film and its devoid of any surprise too with a pretty predictable storyline. Having said that, its surely watchable for its lovable characters and the wit and the charm (charm is subjective here, I found it charming and loving but others may find something else). The animation expectedly was top class and one scene in which the two birds go through Rio on a glider is where it brings in a 3D element.Song, I loved is Fly Love and for this as a director, one needs a good vision.Note : - I watched this is in Spanish without even subtitles so not sure what each character told each other exactly, but I could easily make out what was going through even then. This helped me learn that language is not barrier for content being shown.A good watch after which I felt energetic its 3/5",6,0,1,20 September 2014
Where Eagles Dare," One of the finest war films I have ever seen.
","One of the finest war films I have ever seen. Based on the World War II, this film has a masterful screenplay that was supremely directed. Thanks to the writer Alistair MacLean who wrote the screenplay and to Brian Hutton, the director. I sincerely believe that the screenplay writer should have been present each day of the shoot to monitor that his work is being visualized as he thought of. With the writers presence it's very tough to encapsulate the story of such magnitude and present it in such a great form.The starting music, the shot of the flight, just built up a tension that never let me free till the very end. I am not sure if this was an edge of seat thriller, but for me it was , because I was on the edge just waiting in wonderment, what would happen next when I first saw this many many years ago. Richard Burton as Major John Smith seems to be a master in holding himself in cold blood as he diligently plans the whole plot. While Clint Eastwood as Lt. Morris Schaffer seems to be action hero who executes the plans to precision and yields results against all the odds. Yes, there are certain cinematic liberties taken in building up the drama but that's good as long as they are meant to entertain and enhance the purpose of the film. In 1968, this film might have been made with exorbitant budget. I say this, considering the production values, the cinematography, the sound mixing and even the costumes. But, all is well as it paid off handsomely and the big take away is that it's worth investing in something that has content as the soul. So much money poured in to this meaningful script yielded worthy results.I cannot reveal the plot or even say what it is about, as I have not done for most of my films. But I can say this, if you are lover of some good suspense and drama. Then this film shall be worth your time. A definite 5/5 for this one. This one deserves a watch more than once. Also, I strongly believe this shall stand the test of time as it stood till now and keeps increasing its fan-base.",10,1,5,7 September 2014
How to Train Your Dragon," A movie that is good fun and yet has some clichéd stuff that makes it more predictable.
","A movie that is good fun and yet has some clichéd stuff that makes it more predictable.One would easily fall into the movie because it has every slot of a very entreating and moreover an animated movie. It has action, drama adventure romance and even humour. It's a story of a dragon and a boy understanding their language and vice-versa that is the dragon understanding the boy's language. But how come the dragons understand whatever each one speaks in yet to be deciphered by me coz I did not get that point. Also, this film has some breath taking visuals that are tailor made for the 3D effects and to ensure that what 3D is about is known to the viewer. Look at those dragon rides in the sky. These were taken from Avatar if I have to believe so. The visual affects are for sure great and some scenes are written well too. But overall there is something that this movie lacks and that is a heart. It did not make me go for that boy called 'Hiccup' to do what he wants to do. Neither did it make me feel for the dragon who has got one wing only and flies with the help of an artificial wing made by Hiccup.It is a movie that is good and surely and assuringly entertaining it brings laughs and makes us woo to sometime but such laughs are few and far in between. The kids have liked it as I saw in theatre way back in 2010 and even yesterday, my sister loved it and I did not like it enough, maybe I need more of a fluidity than the commercial rigidity. I would go a 3/5 for a surely entertaining and good animated feature but it missed the point of flowing and thus stuck with what the kids would like more than what the story is about.",6,1,3,8 September 2014
Don't Breathe," A big waste of time. Neither horrifying nor memorable.
","A big waste of time. Neither horrifying nor memorable.This was hyped as one of the best horror films and I fell into the trap of hype and went for it. I came back with curses and complaints than liking it even one bit. My wife loves horror films and she is the driving force and I hope I would be enjoying my first horror film in the theater along with her and that was not to be. To be fair enough, it was a boring experience.Until the time, the antagonist did not open his mouth, there was some eerie feeling. But once his dialogues began, the essence was lost and it became dull and the interest it generated was fizzled out.The good thing is sound. Yes, horror films bank on sound and this film is no different that way. Also, acting was good especially by Stephen Lang. The climax was pretty horrible, to say the least, and the reason behind the antagonist's work was just too lame. I felt like they created a lazy character as a villain and tried to sell him to the audience.It's set up well only to fizzle out at the end. This left me with a bad memory. The movie is forgettable and I am going with a generous 1/5.",2,7,14,8 September 2016
Some Like It Hot," This a laugh out loud film we can enjoy with our families.
","This a laugh out loud film we can enjoy with our families.Now, again we have Billy Wilder at the helm as director and he turns Men into Women and makes a fun ride. Now, why this makeover, they need job and women are given job, so they turn into women, funny isn't it? Yes indeed this is a fun ride. This is a kind of movie that can be watched with a family or friends and can be laughed at. It's a great movie to watch with just that we have to keep our brains out.Billy Wilder had earlier debuted with a movie called MINOR OR MAJOR where a woman becomes a minor to get a ticket at half price, so these kind of funny things are not new in Billy Wilder movies, just that they get funnier here. We have the ever young Marilyn Monroe here and wow, the way she walks is worth a watch and only few can kiss like Marilyn does on screen. There is certain kind of enigma to her personality I think that kept her the highest paid actress then. The technical aspects of this film are good, just that we don't care too much of it because of the constant laughs we get. Yes look at the scenes between Josephine and Daphne (the men turned women) and they are the best. There is a certain kind of comic timing that is just so hilarious. There is lot of running around too, chases in vans, cops, mafia dons, women, music all come together in this film. Above all that, it's the dialogue that makes it more lively, the last scenes where Daphne says 'I am a Man' to which his male supposed fiancé says 'Well, nobody's perfect' and there is THE END of this film. I am going with 4/5 for a great fun movie. And as always Billy Wilder film is worth a watch and this one makes up more than that.",8,1,1,19 September 2014
Pulp Fiction," It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture.
","It's what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture. It's an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years. Not many films, threatened to change the rules of the game, as this film did. In terms of writing, it's non-linear, now non-linear in the real sense, it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either, but they are connected by characters. This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget. Like that, adrenalin shot scene to Mia (Uma Thurman) or reciting Bible's Eziekel 25:17 by Jules (Samuel Jackson).Though, it's nearly 2 and hours, its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered. So, is Vincent dead or not? What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles? And these are left unanswered. With just 7 scenes, you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in it's own way the perspective of the audience. So, I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this. There is something that always works in PULP FICTION. But, what makes this film work is it's writing. It's writing like madness, there is no proper thing called this is it. It can be referred to anything and you may be right. The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character. If I want to write one favourite scene here, it's gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it. Technically, I like the cinematography, sound design and costumes. But above all, I liked performances and dialogues. Thanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else. But for me, this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this.A sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films, no less ever.",10,4,9,19 September 2014
A Beautiful Mind," A well acted Biopic and an interesting take on a life.
","A well acted Biopic and an interesting take on a life.How could I put this, is it the best display of a schizophrenic patient or a biopic of a mathematician who went on to win a Nobel against many odds of his own hallucinations. This is both, and indeed this movie is of John Nash (Russell Crowe) and his story of becoming one of the finest mathematicians ever who has influenced a big deal in research of various subjects.Now, 5 minutes into a film we know there is mysterious, he fights with a friend whom others don't see now this very figment of imagination is blown out of proportion by his own mind and he goes through too many things. Now, that interesting, so there is a man who has hallucinations of seeing people, he is a real man and he has a story that is interesting nevertheless. So, Ron Howard picked it up and transformed into a better one using the screenplay which I must say is engaging in most parts as those hallucinations keep coming back. The other part is naturally mundane as those are the regular events which might happen to anyone.Here, I mean wining Nobel prize does not happen to anyone, yet winning a nobel having such delusions is what made Nash special and that's what made this whole film special. It's tough to be understanding what Nash actually is and why is Nash, the way he is. We are not shown of his birth nor his upbringing, we see him walk into a college as student and begin his journey there. So, there re still few questions unanswered but I would still say this a great watch and better leave those unanswered questions behind, coz the answers might have killed the interest. The cinematography is great and so is the sound and the art design, all are at their place and there is an impetus given by the screenplay itself which I must say is near to something of masterpiece. Yet, it may have its shortcomings as I felts some scenes are overdone just to create an impact. So editing could have been crisper. Above all, a memorable performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly take this movie into a different altitude altogether and that's the reason both have deservedly won many awards. Also, a word about the wonderful blu-ray that provided such remarkable details.It's a 4/5 for a movie that I must say is great and if not anything watch Russell Crowe alone perform John Nash and its worth all the time and money.",8,1,2,19 September 2014
Psycho," Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.
","Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.To pigeonhole this as a thriller would be wrong as per me. It has a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, a huge amount of drama, and even a family backdrop. With all such elements, it would be wrong if I were to categorize this as merely a thriller. Yes, it is filled with thrills and for the 110 minutes of running time, there is hardly any dull moment.I have seen this movie, a number of times before and each time it had a terrific impact. Also, I have always found something new, maybe a new frame, new shot or a new background sound. The discovery does not seem to stop. This I attribute to the many elements that are involved in this film.From placing the camera, composing the shot, revealing the right emotion and making the audiences wait till the shocking aspect is revealed, Hitchcock is at his best in this film. This is indeed one of the more simpler stories he dealt. Yet, he made it so impact full that it continues to surprise audiences even today. Thanks to the music by Bernard Hermann, whose contribution to the film is very important. I cannot imagine this film without the music and I believe that it's because of the music, that the resonance was acquired.If it's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impact full. Now, I do not want to reveal those and give away some details. I can simply say, I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else. The cast is perfect equally, Anthony Perkins does a wonderful job as Norman Bates. He is cold blooded and yet looks so deceptively humane as an extremely caring human. This film and 'The Trial' are perhaps the most important films in his career. It is the first psychological thriller of it's kind as I read in various other sites and perhaps it is also the most violent films made. Though the violence comes for less than 10 minutes, it haunts so brutally, as if it was there all through the film. It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest films of all time by one of the greatest directors.http://braddugg.blogspot.in/",10,3,4,4 May 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," This movie has one of the best conversations ever.
","This movie has one of the best conversations ever.The best part its like the icing on the cake and while the cake is just the temptation to have, we have a delicious taste of a fine icing. And all through it asks one pertinent question that can a man and a woman be friends without the sex coming in between.We all beautiful movies, romantic movies and we shall surely love this one coz it's both beautiful and romantic. It's romantic and it speaks for the most part about sex and then later on to the small things that we surely appreciate about the other person. It's the small things that make the big picture of life and those are shown beautifully like Sally ordering a dish at a restaurant. Also, this one has of the best embarrassing moments in cinema that is Sally faking an orgasm in a restaurant and situation of Harry. Immediately the woman on the other table tells 'I'll have what she's having'.Screenplay by Nora Ephron is just wonderful; the poignancy is maintained by bringing in elderly couples that have held on to each other for years and letting us know how they had met or got convinced to tie the knot.More than anything it simply works because of the chemistry between the two leads. Bill Crystal (Harry) and Meg Ryan (Sally) are wonderful in their roles. It's a treat to let them be the characters and giving them space and time to know each other, to understand and then realize what they truly need.It's 4/5 for a cinema that celebrates romance but it in a funny way.",8,2,2,20 September 2014
To Kill a Mockingbird," A compelling drama and a best written work for celluloid as far courtroom drama goes.
","A compelling drama and a best written work for celluloid as far courtroom drama goes.Written as a novel and adapted as a screenplay, made as a film, the century's most widely known novel is one of the finest pieces of writing. Now, you have half job done, the best work is written, but Robert Mulligan as a director has to handle a tougher task, he has to bring a well written and much known work with life and living characters onto the screen. Man, he does this job with flying colors. Firstly, the acting be it a Tom Robinson or a Mayella or a lesser known Cunningham, all have done exceptionally well. Above all stands, Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch, a disciplined father and a lovable one indeed. He brings life to a character of rare dignity that is realistic yet ideal. Told through the eyes of a small girl Jean Finch, this story is one good one to hear or see. It has many moments that give us a lump in the throat. The climax is a befitting one and is symbolism of 'Natures judgement'. The courtroom acting of Tom Robinson and Finch and Mayella is enough to say that even for a brief 20 minutes of courtroom scene, this movie is still considered as one of the best courtroom dramas. That was the power and passion involved in the making.Acting and writing both are sublime and all else just falls in place, be it art direction or background score, they would have been good anyways, with the acting that we see it is obvious why it is hailed as a textbook for classic acting and same is the case with writing too.I loved it and am hopeful any one who see it will. Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain,a knife and our lives. That dialogue summarizes most of the movie. But the very point that is being said is humanism, we alienate humans with our own prejudices, be it a beggar or a toilet cleaner even guards at offices are not treated as humans as we feel as if we are above them, there is only color and it colorless, there is only one caste and religion that is humanity. It's a 5/5 without any doubt and please request all to see it. Have patience though, we have to endure it. Watch it for acting and writing above everything else.",10,0,1,20 September 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Most of the times, a film that's rebellious has brought joy to me, and this was a great rebellion movie.
","Most of the times, a film that's rebellious has brought joy to me, and this was a great rebellion movie.R.P. McMurphy (Fondly regarded as Mac or Randall) has to fight a nurse in a mental institution and before he fails he brought one man, freedom. The Chief got free and indeed freed Mac too. Death can be such a relief in a painful world It's better to die than to go through monstrous pain that shall make us fall one day so much painfully Jack Nicholson as R P McMurphy gave us one the best anti authoritarian, anti establishment, recidivist, performances that we have rarely seen. Look at home, giving the commentary of baseball match, explaining in great detail each intricacy of the game, or the way he brings the patients on one platform by playing a basketball game. He does so many things from fishing to partying, to make those poor sick people happy but succumbs to the torture and is let free by The Chief (Will Sampson). Miss Ratched (Louise Fletcher) is the authoritarian nurse who feels that she is doing a world of good, by listening to the patients giving them medication and controlling them by her henchmen, she is not all evil but most of her certainly is evil. We don't like dictators for one reason, because we want to dictate our own terms, we want to free ourselves from the bondage set by anyone else and bind ourselves by our own will to something. Ratched was hated because she set the terms, irrespective of the amount of pain she was going to transpire within those poor souls.And thus, R P McMurphy, who was till then a sane man, got wild, weird and mad.Watch the movie for performances more than anything. The writing was good but I can't say great as it is mostly confined within the premises of the mental institution where patients stammer, mutter, scream, yell and even be silent. So how they act is more engrossing than what was written. The Chief's stoned emotions Cheswick's fight for cigarettes, Billy's plea not to tell his mother. All are acted out extremely well. For extracting such great acting from the cast, I give Milos Forman, the director complete credit and he has done an outstanding job indeed. He stood out as the watchman, the captain, watched each emotion and molded them wonderfully to make us see what this film stands today.The lighting, sound and cinematography are good. The music was great, it was not that creepy, or sad music, it was just as required for a scene. I'd rate this a great movie, as it brings alive the spirit of rebellion and I love to control my own life, even if I have to rebel for it. This is a 5/5 movie and one of the finest pictures known for acting, it's a triumph even in tragedy.",10,3,6,8 September 2014
Downfall," A really well made film that despite having monotony to it, was showed in a tight vein.
","Saw this long pending film that had been kept aside as I believed that this would have been a monotonous account of Hitler. But finally, did see it coz I had wanted to write something on a revolt. Now this film, adds nothing much in terms of differentiating Hitler and neither does it portrays him in a sympathetic, empathetic light and thus the monotony still prevails. This gruesome criminal still is shown in the same light of what he have learnt of him since our childhood. Having said that, it brings in a closer perspective of him from the witness of Frau Junge who worked as his secretary in the last days. She seems to have had great belief in Hitler and that even in the hopeless days, expects Hitler to turn the tide and bring a win to Germany. The monster only in few scenes is humane but again when he utters that he is proud of the Jewish killings, the monter returns.Admiration I do have on the account that it so grippingly presented with so many characters all have a different view on many things and letting us know few unknown German history things. We know the end, its a matter of time for that to be shown as well but the way it was done and the entire movie was shot is commendable.More than anything, I have not seen a better portrayal of Hitler in any film till date and also never saw a better gripping depiction of the world war specifically final days of the war. I can clearly say this coz neither I paused nor got bored at any instance all through the film and watched it in one go.This deserves a watch to see how it is enacted by all the actors and for the profound authenticity that clearly depicts how Germany really was. All the technical departments did their job well. It's 4/5 from me for a really well made film that despite having monotony to it, was showed in a tight vein.",8,0,2,20 September 2014
Whiplash," Drums, drumming and drummer. I precisely put what this film is about.
","Drums, drumming and drummer. I precisely put what this film is about.There is a kid in his twenties who joins the so-called best music school in America and it's about how he goes about his passion that is Drums.Drums are percussion instruments that make a lot of noise if not played well. But here, they seem to have been played to the beat.Okay, now let me give this to all the jazz lovers. If you are going to watch with an expectation to learn or know more or to understand jazz music, stay away, please. Except for few mentions of Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, Buddy Rich and a few more, this film has not got any jazz. In the garb of jazz, it has got music that is as good as any other film with no greatness added.The movie is more about abuse of power and authority than Jazz for sure. Not one frame I saw can be termed 'musical'.The acting is superb above all else. The whole outlook is dark and I was very surprised because that's so not music. Perhaps, it deals with dark emotions thus, it is set dark.I am going with a 3/5 for a good one, but only for some good acting. All else is just OK.",6,0,4,18 January 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," Filth, profanity and excessive debauchery. It adds up to make one of the most fearless uncompromising films of our time.
","Filth, profanity and excessive debauchery. It adds up to make one of the most fearless uncompromising films of our time.The master director Scorsese and the wonderful actor Leonardo DiCaprio collaborate to give us the life of Jordan Belfort, a stock broker. The collaboration is fearless and it is produced by these two guys themselves, that is Scorsese and DiCaprio. Thus, it gave them the freedom to go full throttle and never for a moment hinder any thing nor go for uncompromising lines or scenes. Thankfully, they did go the full throttle and gave us a charming film. Yes, since this is India, probably a few scenes were censored, but thanks to censor board here who have not cut the film for the language it uses. If the dialogs were cut, the film would not have even one scene in the first places. Almost every dialog uses the 'F' word. The best part is that they use it as if it was something divine and never even care of show any displeasure. That's what is called madness and passion when you are relentless in pursuing something you believe in. Scorsese pursues this film as if its is a new toy given to him and he must explore ways of playing with it. The acting was superb by everyone. Leonardo steals the show like never before playing an out and out protagonist that involves all kinds of histrionics. Also, the other actors like Jonah Hill who plays Donny and Matthew McConaughey in that wonderful restaurant scene.I am astonished by the editing department. It would have been really tough for them to edit this film. Though, it is nearly 3 hours it is not long because most moments are interesting and endearing. The dialog makes the scenes wonderful and thanks to writing by Jordan Belfort and the screenplay writer Terence Winter. Mind you, there is lot of drug abuse and physical romance involved apart form the language used. Yes, it's profane and there excessive debauchery and that's why I call it fearless film making. So beware of these and if you are willing to give a way a few things like, your prejudices and even hypocrisy you will enjoy this film. It's completely for open-minded audience and if you are one. Please go and enjoy this wonderful film. It does not seem long and tickles bones even in the most awkward moments. A 5/5 and still this would be so less for the master 'Martin Scorsese' his body of work speaks of genius and this stands along with his finest work. Thanks to Leonardo, man you have made a place in the hearts of people who love great acting earlier and with this one, you are a man of great interesting subjects and you proved it producing this.",10,1,3,7 September 2014
Jaws," Truly, one of the greatest pictures ever made.
","Truly, one of the greatest pictures ever made.The film is about capturing a killer shark that feeds on humans. It's a spectacle to be seen on the big screen. The first half or three-fourth of the film is about planning how to go about capturing the shark. The last part is all in the sea. It's an amazing film because the way it traverses from scene to scene. The film involves a lot of character build up and a basis for the shark to be killed. It also keeps minimalistic in sound and gets loud only when needed.The sound design and the music by John Williams is a study in itself. The editing is precise and keeps the movie gripping. To be fair, there are hardly any dull moments in the film, even though the end is known. The journey is so interesting that the destination feels like a by-product of the journey.Steven Spielberg grew in stature with this film. I am told by my uncle who saw the film in theater 1970's when it got released that it was indeed a phenomenon and one of his friends does not enter into the water even today that is 40 years after seeing the film he is still afraid of sharks. Though funny, it is indeed true and confirmed by the person itself.It's impactful and must be revered for the change it brought about in mindset and understanding of the sea the nature of sharks.Acting is stupendous and though I don't know any of the cast, they played their roles superbly and are heroic in their own ways.A 4/5 for one the great films ever made, though it lost it's aura a bit as technology got updated, it must be seen for the content.",8,3,6,18 September 2016
The Wrestler," To be alone in old age or to wrestle at that age which is more painful?
","To be alone in old age or to wrestle at that age which is more painful?The Wrestler is for Mickey Rourke. He is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and he played not just with a big heart but with a big body that took a lot of pain. Mickey, along with the director Darren Aronofsky (know for showing pain on screen) took me to one of the most painful trips and made me roam if at times in blood then at times in tears. surely this to my memory is the most painful movie the earlier one being Requiem for a Dream by the same director. You cannot watch such films again and again coz they make you freeze and uncomfortable. I dare did it twice.When Danny Boyle said he wanted to do a wrestler kind of movie, 127 hours was born. That's when my interest began and was shell shocked by how real the whole act was in this film. At the second watch, I say it's still the same feeling. My eyes became moist at last scene each time.Writing is good coz it's a clichéd tale but the way director had interpreted the whole thing is simply worth a watch. My salutations to Darren Aronofsky, one of the few men who shows us things as they are without fabricating them much.I had not seen this movie in 2008 so cannot comment much on if Mickey should have got an Oscar as I did not see 'The Milk' yet for which, Sean Penn won the award. But surely it was a performance of a lifetime and to bear it all was real tough job and Mickey simply was Randy The Ram in every frame. The climax again (I mean like his other movies) is left for viewers interpretation by Darren and I would leave it without much interpretation.All my accolades to Darren for conceiving and telling a tale in the most painful way possible. And many more kudos to Mickey to having played it and it was a real resurrection for him too who was back as recently in 2005 after a hiatus of 15 years.Technically, the sound design was awesome and the cinematography was just as expected, it was not over the board but could have been much better. The dialogues are very clichéd so to say coz that's what the character is too, so no qualms there. The screenplay is superb and so is editing please see how both worked for a film like this. Over and above everything was the acting that was so very natural by everyone.Thanks Darren for showing this to us. It's 4/5. But I am not sure if ever I will see this agony and pain again.",8,0,0,20 September 2014
Ray," Though clichéd, the music and the performances make it an interesting biopic.
","Though clichéd, the music and the performances make it an interesting biopic. Jamie Foxx surely gave a performance that deserved all the adulation it got. The Academy Award seems to be the tip of iceberg for this film. Thanks to Jamie for surrendering himself to the role and giving us one heck of a show. Charles Ray, on whom this biopic is based on was an exemplary music talent. He generated sublime music and got rewards equally. He was for most of the good time, rage of the nation of USA. He had the knack of breaking records, creating chart busters and being on top through 1950's and 1960's. But he had one challenge that was gifted to him, he was blind. Now despite that, he became something of a magician with the piano, with music, in arranging the choir and managing his own band. Wow, these are great feats that very few people have done and he was the one who seems to have started it all. Now, this film just does not show the white picture of Ray, he has some Grey shades like getting into narcotics, using heroin and had some infidelity too. Now, this makes the character of Ray colorful, The colors are well brought by Jamie Foxx in the role and he made it effortless. Under those dark glasses are eyes that had seen a great part of life and world, that rarely few get an opportunity to witness. And through this film, the director Taylor Hackford tried to show us a good glimpse of what Ray had been through in his times.It can be commended for the setup, the periodical art direction, the cinematography, the editing, the writing. But if there is an aspect that stands above all is the music. The very important usage of music makes this film completely interesting and fun to which. The selection, assembling of music well and making Jamie perform to the music I believe was the masterstroke of the director and this paid of well. The screenplay is laced well with the past coming back infrequently and helping us understand the reactions of Ray. Yet, I believe it was kind of preachy and would have liked it more active than the passive character of his mother. I give the flaw away, because even the junior Ray performed his tiny role competently well and took this away from me. It's an effortless watch and a wonderful Biopic. Above all else, watch this for an encompassing and endearing performance by Jamie Foxx. A 4/5 for this.",8,1,2,7 September 2014
The Lion King," To live life like a king, we must earn the throne.
","To live life like a king, we must earn the throne.Fight for the throne, achieve it and then you are the king. That's off course the climax of the movie but to get there, it takes a lot. I have a few personal memories of this film. Watching it in Sangeet theatre, feeling like Simba when back home. When I watch it today too, I got the kid out in me and was reveling in those memories. It's a simple story, made very well and oh yeah great photography and terrific music. In fact this is more a musical than an adventure.Before PIXAR invaded the animation industry and when there was Walt Disney at the helm, this film was the best ever animated film and it still is in many ways. This has 2D animation and is drawn with lines unlike the PIXAR 3D animation and is completely based out of drawings and a typical storyboard where every small move has to be drawn. It took a lot of pain to detail for sure but the tougher job is to put them all together and make it what it stands today. Kudos to directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff and thanks Disney again for giving us a movie to vie for and woo for.Technically, a great film and it's made greater by the cinematography, the quality of animation, the story that's about the making of the king, a commonplace story though but will work on an emotional level. Today, i found few silly things, but will give them away as they also seem to fall in place. One specific scene I liked is Simba walking with the king Mufasa to learn a few things, a father son thing that works.It's 4/5 for a great animation feature with a universal story.",8,0,0,20 September 2014
Inception," Joy in letting things fold has not been better for a long time now.
","Joy in letting things fold has not been better for a long time now.This was one joy ride. It made me delve, right from the word go and by the time it was over. I was wondering, so soon? Bring it on, once more. I couldn't comprehend some nuances of it so surely will go for it again.This is a great multi-genre embedded fun, and technically encompasses great movies made in CGI. But the best lies in the writing, the screenplay, the mis-en scene technique that evolved in earlier Nolan's movies has come to the full flow here with one in one and in another thing, three things happen at once with the time duration being different for each occurrence.The music, the cinematography, the audiography and the acting all were just in place but above all comes screenplay writing and the editing, it did not give me a moment to shake my head and when I did, I felt I missed an important thing. It's a personal movie to me as it made me revive the memories of dream in which I saw almost 120 years of happenings in a couple of hours sleep way back in 2002. Oh, what a scary dream it was.Just dive and surf into the ocean of dreams made by inception and it's worth it.Thanks Nolan for this. It's 5/5.",10,0,2,20 September 2014
Stalag 17," Billy Wilder has not disappointed me and rather has lifted my spirits.
","Billy Wilder has not disappointed me and rather has lifted my spirits. Whenever I feel low, or feel like bored, I get hold of a Wilder film and his films have each time surprised me, from 'Major Or Minor' to 'One,Two,Three' there is a charisma that I believe, only Wilder could bring to the film. Stalag 17 is about a prison escapade and it's not a serious drama nor a suspenseful thriller, it's a plain fun-watch. It has many moments of wit and humor, especially for the good first part. Be it Animal (Robert Strauss) flirting with Russian women, or Shapiro (Harvery Lembeck) collecting letters, they are fun filled scenes and they did not seem to be cynical or mocking at the Nazis. They seemed just plain funny. Wilder, I must say is a master writer, who knows not just only the dialog but also in which tone if it is said, brings out what emotion in an actor, and what reaction can be derived from a viewer. He deliberates acts in this film and they sync well with the script. Not for once, I felt anything was out of place, in this escape drama. Though most of the film focuses on the acts of the prisoners and how they have fun with each other day in and day out, rather than the plan of escape and all, I felt it was all right there, and it helped me engage and even empathize with their characters. Wilder, is one of the few master of the basic principle of writing, that is actions and motives make characters, a set of these characters make a plot and better their actions, better the plot. I am speaking more of the genius of Wilder I think than the film in itself. OK, the film touches all the right notes, in it's 2 hour length and fails to falter as per me. It's not a great Prisoners of War film like 'Bridge on the River Kwai' or even 'Shawshank Redemption' but this essentially a film where a set of people have a motive and they get their thing done. William Holden as Sergeant Sefton gives a delightful performance and there is a host of other actors who gave some wonderful performances too, like Robert Strauss as 'Animal' The sound design seemed perfect, considering that this is a 1953 film and it had to accommodate a landscape of War. The editing was fine too, and other aspects did a great job. Of all, I am impressed with the environment that Wilder brings with each of his films, be it 'Lost Weekend' or 'Some Like It Hot' or even 'The Apartment'. There is a sense of belonging such as being in that place, where the characters are, this is effectively done by right lighting and right art direction and even supreme cinematography. But Wilder has proved yet again that he was one of the most original and most acceptable voices we had who used his pen to speak more effectively than most men do. I salute his dialog, his scene writing and even his screenplay. Though the credit is shared by Edwin Blum, I suppose so that Wilder was behind the writing.I am going with 4/5 for this. It's not the ideal nail biting stuff if such is the expectation, it's laid back fun-filled watch that mostly you will not regret watching. I am happy to have caught up with this.",8,2,4,7 September 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," A prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison escape stories.
","A prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison escape stories.A man wanted freedom, he redeems his life by escaping for the Shawshank prison and the man's name is Andy Dufrsne. This film is dramatic take of a man, and in a way it is similar to Escape from Alcatraz and The Great Escape. The similarity is that the above mentioned films are also prison escapes and the similarity ends there. This movie is more about hope and redemption than anything else and this is what sets this film above the other escape stories. For a man, freedom is highest value and he would do anything to get it. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is such a nice fellow that we would for sure like him for the way he is, when he chuckles at the warden when music is played in prison or when he asks for beers to his friends without having a sip. We like him because he is selfless, humane in nature. But more so, he is selfish and works towards his freedom at the same time. Now, in terms of character he has company n the firm of Red (Morgan Freeman) and what a great character, RED was, is understood, by the way he narrates the story. And thus, it's not surprising for Morgan Freeman to have garnered more best actor award nominations than Tim Robbins. The novel, written by Stephen sets it up in 1949 - 1966 period in a prison called Shawshank in Maine, USA. Frank Darabont made it into a film that's great to see but also tests our patience. It's great in terms of cinematography, lighting and costume design and even art direction, but greater was the acting by two lead characters. Just because of their acting, I was compelled to see this story of HOPE, that ends in a good way.The sound design is great and worthy of a special mention as a realistic sound the prison of 1940's to 60's was created. Editing though, I believe could have been done by cutting short a few scenes, or rather cutting out a few scenes, just like say one week of hole for Bogs. I have seen this thrice and, since I knew that this is the best rated picture on IMDb, but the more I see it, the less I started to like it, may be I know the story too very well. Maybe, I am finding fault with reasons of a prison escape done too trivially, by crawling in gutter for 500 yards or by creating a hole in the room. Or maybe, I think that Andy was just too easy and too casual on what he did. These are all my own reasons that put me down each time, I see this. Yet this has a good place in my memory and heart for I see this, just because there is hope, and HOPE IS A GOOD THING. I just love the dialogs of this film and thanks to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for that.It's a 4/5 for a movie that may not be the best in my view yet is a good one to be watching. Go listen dialogs like 'you get busy living or you get busy dying'. They are like music to ears.",8,0,0,6 January 2013
Rango," A fun film.
","A fun film.The film starts with lizard having fun in water and then the Intro of RANGO happens in a bar. Watch it to see how the transformation happens from a lizard to a hero. This brings back the same fun ride that we had in childhood in a much better choreographed way with brilliant animation, sound and video quality but yet it's the same fun. This film reminisces of the West Classics like The Good The Bad and The Ugly and the music for sure will make us recede to those times of Ennio Morricone classic pieces of music.Now the technical part, dialogue is sharp witted and lines of Rango voiced by Johnny Depp are the best ones and the voice is done so well by Johnny who comes out yet again with a performance that is awestruck. The animation of rodents, reptiles and is done well and the textures can be appreciated and the differences too can be figured out there is a lot of detailing that has to be seen and it's a rarity actually for the Non Pixar Animated movies.. Directed by Gore Verbinski who directed the Pirates movies has done this one too with heart and an uncomplicated mind. The screenplay is lethargic at most time echoing most of themes the western classics like brawls between the gun holders, bank robbery etc...This for sure is a movie that is enjoyable if we have time to give for it, but I doubt really how many can invest their time for this tiny Rango It's 3/5.",6,0,0,20 September 2014
Paths of Glory," The climax song and the expressions of the soldiers sum it all of how much dreadful pain a war can bring.
","The climax song and the expressions of the soldiers sum it all of how much dreadful pain a war can bring.The sound and the visuals made with terse verbiage and tight screenplay consummate this film to be the best war film ever made that highlights the corruptness of the superior officers who presume they can get away with anything. It takes us through the military trenches filled with nothing but men willing to fight, the gore war landscapes where men will fall in the attack by the enemy. The court martial that is closed even before it started, all this done and the emotions of those accused just resonate of what gruesome magnitude can the war become and the worse part is being killed by their own men. Have mercy, have them killed by enemy let them die like soldiers I was craving within.Impeccable vision of Kubrick has brought this movie to state from where it actually was, the story as such has nothing much to be proud of but the way it portrayed with such raw energy from the actors has to be acclaimed.Art direction, Oh my god what it could have taken to set up those trenches and the war space is really commendable given that in those days, they had to set these up manually.Kudos again to the vision of Kubrick for a war film that can be considered one of the best ever. My rating 5/5.",10,0,1,20 September 2014
Despicable Me," A highly entertaining animated film.
","A highly entertaining animated film. When I see an animated film, I am drawn to comparisons with the wonderful PIXAR films. This film takes many clues form those and packs it up nicely and gives a film which is entertaining and nice. I can simply say. it's a nicely done formulaic animated film. It's formulaic coz we have seen such stories, a normal getting acquainted with kids and then going overboard to keep them happy. This reminded me Monsters Inc and even Finding Nemo.The purpose is different and so is the approach, but the crux remains the same and yes there is wonderful animation to admire. The army of minions is a treat to watch. The films has some wonderful moments too, where we feel something, we root for Gru, the supposed best villain of the planet, voice given by Steve Carell. Also, there are moments of hilarious laughter, cannot simply mention one but many.Essentially, there is a hero and there is a villain, the hero wins over villain. As simple as that this film can be pigeonholed, yet it gives the humane touch of feeling for one's own kids. A bad human trying to be good with those he loves. These themes are embedded well into a rather clichéd script and they make it interesting. Although, I did not die for it, I can safely say I like it, maybe I will not get back to this film, but any kid who would watch this, will more or less appreciate it. But since we are now acquainted so many films that such themes and have great quality. Those aspects might be demeaning this film.All the way down, I was mostly comparing the film, let me take it as a single film, now I love it. I love many things about this. The detailing of the characters, their brow to legs and even that wonderful story of Gru and the ballet story. Nice, and wow.Only that since it makes me compare films and lets me down by some bit, I am going with 4/5. This film is surely like able and for a few it may be even wonderful. Perspectives differ, yet the content remains the same.",8,1,1,7 September 2014
Raging Bull," A film that keeps inspiring many viewers.
","A film that keeps inspiring many viewers. A wonderful depiction and portrayal of a just interesting character.It's the boxer Jake LaMotta's life, the personal envy he goes through which transpires into his professional failures at times. Now, this is not a film about a boxing but is about a flawed man. His fall his rise and his redemption and getting on with life. A boxer who became a stand up comedian. This is a testimony of acting, the physical transformation that Robert De Niro underwent for the role of Jake LaMotta is remarkable and is one that is helped, even 33 years later as a great symbol of submitting one self to a role. Robert De Niro, after this film was taken very seriously and was enlisted as a great actor hence. The writing was good, if not great but the depiction of the written work was something stupendous. The supporting characters, be it Joe Pesci as Jake's brother Joey LaMotta or the lesser know referees in the boxing ring, were all great in the portrayal of their roles. The film flows so fluidly in emotions that it seems natural. An example, if I can take is that of Jake asking his brother Joey about Vickie, Jake's wife, when they were setting up a television. That scene was cool and many scenes like these were cool too. The fights are wonderfully choreographed and the camera placement is a wonderful thing. Camera became a character and took me as viewer into the ring. The jabs, the punches and the blood that was oozing out, all seemed real. Damn the camera, damn the cinematographer, and damn the director. I damn them because such a thing would be hard for many to achieve and they have done a stupendous job. The shots are wonderful and iconic. Also, the choice of Black and White as the presentation Medium, unlike Colour seems to have set this movie apart from a regular film. It is intriguing and striking.The sound direction is another aspect that is perfect, from the sound of camera flashes to the screaming of Jake in prison, it was all wonderful and it remained in head so long after the movie. Also, the background music which would almost go unnoticed if not given a keen ear to, has played a substantial role in elevating the emotions.All in all, a well crafted and a perfect film that I believe is one of the best sports film and one of the finest performances ever displayed. Scorsese was considered a great film maker since this film, and even today stands above many as one of the finest film makers of our time. Thanks to LaMotta for his own work on this, but more thanks to DeNiro and Scorsese for giving us one of the finest films ever. An undoubted 5/5 for this.",10,1,2,7 September 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A good action film but it disappoints in a big way.
","A good action film but it disappoints in a big way. So what's there in this that's better than the other Chris Nolan films, is style and the magnanimous production design where now, we have exceptional aerial shots and many of them hovering over the fictional city of Gotham. But what's missing is the soul of Nolan, the screenplay. The music by Hans Zimmers is OK OK and more melodramatic than action packed. The editing is too very bad coz too many details that lead to nothing are presented in this 2 hours 25 minute saga that could have been done in 2 hours, only if the extra characters of the board members and others were cut down and those many aerial shots were cut down too. The dialogues are way too bland for Bane (Tom Hardy). Bane is not anywhere close to be menacing but at the end he turns out to be doing, what Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) says. No, great villain either. And coming to our batman, he fails in a fight and he has to redeem his freedom, he takes an ordeal of doing a climb that takes more than 10 minutes of screen space. Was so much necessary is what I ask now. Also, there are identities revealed only at the end like that of Robin or Talia, ah too much suspense being held till the end is not a good thing, we don't need oil when the food has been cooked up. The saddest part turns out that Alfred who has protected Wayne for such a long time, cries for he has failed Bruce Wayne. The much sad part is Bruce Wayne has to now live in exile as he is presumably dead just to be shown in a frame to reveal that Batman cannot end. OK, yes so he used autopilot too but that's so impertinent at the end coz we would have been exhausted by dialogue after dialogue for a large part of the film which take away the sheen. The dialogue I must say, is very clichéd and even amateurish from a man who has written Dark Knight and Inception. Now, remember this is a sequel for Dark Knight so we do expect a big ride, so nothing like that anywhere, this is rather a slow paced dramatic and less action packed turmoil that takes us through the torture of being a superhero. The blessing in disguise, although is Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) oh, she comes up with some good acting skills and is in fact our hero, coz she killed the villain. Yeah, we know that 'he who kills a villain is hero'. So, it has got good things but they are far away from each other. It's an okie dokie kinda ride and a 2/5 would be apt as per me. But if you have high expectations coz it's NOLAN you are a welcome aboard member to a disappointment group.",4,2,5,19 September 2014
Before Sunrise," Seen this many a time just to fall in love with it.
","Seen this many a time just to fall in love with it. It's easily one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen. Now romance need not be just physical but conversational, and this movie drives all way through in conversation between a couple, a pair. When I saw it first time my enthusiasm was only if the boy-girl be together or part. Once I saw if for first time, each time I was more in love with the conversation they had. The story, the plot is simple its a boy meets girl and we have got to see a romance budding like a blossoming flower that is gonna be so very beautiful the next dawn. Now, had the conversation be kiddish and childish as they happen in our marriage looks (typically Indian marriage looks) where the boy and girl as each other their interests, their likes and dislikes, this could have been a bore, the conversation is so very intriguing ranging from what pisses you off to how we dream our own world to be.It's all about Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) and what a day of a lifetime it was for them so it shall be for us, I promise for us if we care to watch such movies with a ear and a heart. Now, there are so many subdued underlying themes in this that can be found if we sit and just explore even a poem on milkshake seems to be saying something about a lifestyle. This movie is more about life than about anything else. It's a must watch for all those who just love the love we want to have or we are already having in our own lives. Just have time for this and get your ears for words seem like music all through.Just love it and will keep loving it. It's 5/5 for one of the best romances ever.",10,5,7,19 September 2014
Fantastic Mr. Fox," A film that's nostalgic in many terms and terrific technically.
","A film that's nostalgic in many terms and terrific technically.This is an animated stop-motion film and one of it's kind in today's world where there is a huge amount of technical brilliance. Stop- motion animation is one of the oldest techniques as old as Alice in wonderland in 1903 and even much before that. This film adopts the same technology and adds up a lot of speediness to make the stop motion to look real animation. So technically it is great.The content is fun, but there is a strong script over a not so strong story which is an inherent ingredient of Wes Anderson film. Had there been a stronger story, this would have been more wonderful. The voice over is stupendous and the dialogues are well written too. Above all, the humor is subtle and yet hilarious. Music by Alexandre Desplat is worth a mention as it adds a lot of weight to this film. It's a great score and gels well with the film, Wes Anderson can take a simple story and make it more than a worthwhile watch and he proves yet again with this. The art direction and the colors used are great and made the film an treat to the eye. The characterisation is one that you would find in a typical commercial film. There is a hero, a heroine, a sidekick and a villain. Together, there is a family too. So this is a perfect stop- motion family entertainer I would say.I loved this for many reasons and thanks to Anderson for bringing stop-motion back. Big thanks for his wit and sense of humor that are displayed generously in the film.A 4/5 to a great stop motion animation film.",8,0,0,25 January 2016
Amélie," It is a delicious tale of a waif who finds love as icing on the cake.
","It is a delicious tale of a waif who finds love as icing on the cake.This movie is all goodness and goodness surely prevails and changes life for good. How much ever we may please others by making happy, it's our own happiness that makes us live and love life. She does the humane things of helping people, by making a pinter find his object, by making a two people fall in love, by making a man find his mysterious photo face. But it is her and her only love which she finds make her joy eternal. The story goes a long way from going into her brain and finding out what kind of questions she has to her delusions, her sad childhood and her fantasies. This film is ranked as one of the finest French Cinemas to come in last decade or so, and I will go with it for it's full of whimsical moments and never a frame is mundane. I have sen this film thrice and what I have always fallen in love each time is with the composition of the scenes and the cinematography, I say this is sheer poetry. That is, the whole film is as fluid as a beautiful poem is being recited, just that the language is French, we need the subtitles to help us through. I wish I learnt French to avoid reading those subtitles. Audrey Tautou is refreshing, her every nuance indeed is beautiful and I have loved her over and over again whenever I see this piece of art. The music by Yann Tiersen is delightful and accompanies perfectly with the stunning visuals. Above all, if I must thank anyone, then it's the director Jean Pierre Jeunet who made a good tale written by Guillaume Laurant into a great one. Of course, the director was helped a great deal by the cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel who created a perfect Paris. Oh, did I mention that the film was shot in Paris, yes indeed Paris is shown and we see a very intrinsic and an intimate Paris that is devoid of the famous monuments it has and comprised of the simple homes and lanes most tourists might be missing. Yet, all is beautiful and mostly, you will love it. Oh, I used the word love many a time so this is not a film that is merely likable, it's a delightful tale that is loved by many and I am happy to be one among it's lovers. A 5/5 for a great loving film.",10,1,3,19 September 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," This I suppose, is the greatest fantasy film made till date.
","This I suppose, is the greatest fantasy film made till date.There are many reasons why this is the greatest. The visual effects were spectacular and they have increased the scope of any film. This film took the film-making to new heights which were previously not thought of. Peter Jackson for this very reason became one of the greatest filmmakers ever.The beginning is very simple, and it takes us to the backstory of the ring. The battle scenes are nothing short of epic. The culmination is happy and this has a feel good ending. everything is so perfectly commercial on the face of it. But, to tell it the way it has been told is stupendous.The acts by all, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sean Austin as Sam, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn are the most memorable for me. These are characters I shall not forget ever in my lifetime.The writing by JRR Tolkein is a masterpiece in itself but to translate such visual strength to the celluloid would have been the greatest challenge for any filmmaker. Just happy that Peter Jackson did his bit in bringing one of the greatest fantasy novels to the public reach, He actually did a great service by doing so. He served the book readers and the film viewers hugely.Thanks to all, who have made this film and the trilogy a possibility and I am going with 5/5. Nothing less for one of the greatest films.",10,1,2,8 September 2016
The Matrix," A great looking film that has less substance than the expectation.
","A great looking film that has less substance than the expectation.It's a movie that looks great and even the premise is outstanding but is made comical i action ruining the point to an extent. Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where 'Neo' and Morpheus talk.Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the 'Bullet movement' or the 'walking on the walls' they were stunningly and with an ease.We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of 'being free from world'. It takes from the Buddhism concept of 'Nirvana' I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.I might not like this whole picture being seen again, but I am going with a 3/5 that means the film is surely good. I might not watch this again just that I am not much into action.",6,2,5,8 September 2014
The Thin Red Line," Perhaps, the greatest war movie, in terms of scale.
","Perhaps, the greatest war movie, in terms of scale.I only wish it had a protagonist who takes the story forward. Yes, we have an army of soldiers and there is a battalion. But a guiding force would have done so much more is what I firmly believe. As it is, the film is no less than a great war film.There is a supreme ensemble cast which includes Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, George Clooney and a host of many other actors. They do a great job in empathizing with the characters and playing their roles perfectly. They become soldiers and behave like soldiers. Not for once, did I see a Sean Penn but I saw a passionate soldier fighting for his country. All the others have done a fine job I must say. Though there some hundreds of actors in the whole film, never did I was there was an extra or someone is out of place. That is what I think is utilizing resources appropriately.The cinematography by John Toll is exemplary and indeed I can say this is one of the finest works I have seen in a war film. I learned that this film even with such great camera work did not win an academy award for cinematography but it was awarded to 'Saving Private Ryan', which also has fine camera work and great choreography of war scenes. I can understand the fix, the jury would have been in deciding which one was better.I resisted myself from watching this, because I never thought I had the patience of sitting through a 3 hour full length war film, which is highly detailed and nuanced. Yet, after watching it today, I confess I have seen one of the finest war films of contemporary cinema and I salute the director Terrence Malick for showing the war as it is, unabashedly, uncompromisingly and more importantly, bringing the human emotions on to the surface without any drama.The director Terrence Malick has done very few films in his career. He began in 1969 and yet this was just his fourth film as a director. He surely has a vision that is grand and it takes time to detail all of those. But, I hope he does more work and showcases his talent giving such exemplary cinema.A 4/5 for this one and I ma happy to have finally watch it. To watch it again, I need a lot patience though.",8,3,6,5 May 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," Lovely music and good acting are just not good enough for a Coen Brothers film.
","Lovely music and good acting are just not good enough for a Coen Brothers film. There has to be something intriguing.This film is good, but its not great. That is the disappointing part of a Coen Brothers film. If it's good, then it will just not work. This film specifically is a bout a musician and his cat. The cat plays an interesting role in the film.This is a musical, as there is lot of music and the protagonist is musician himself. Based in 1960's folk music, the music is just too good. Be it 'Hang Me'or 'Five Hundred Miles'. Thanks to the artists Oscar Isaac, Justin Timberlake and others.Production design and Cinematography are immaculate which is very much expected. The writing is good too. But it's actually the acting that made the lines good. Oscar Isaac shines as Llewyn Davis. But it's John Goodman who stole the film for me. His performance is so so good.This film triggered an interesting debate between me an my friend, as to why the end and the beginning are similar. Is it a metaphor or placed deliberately or is it something else. I missed it completely but when I reflected upon what I saw, it was interesting for me.So there are interesting aspects, but yet lot of the film is obvious. And if the expectation is a of a typical Coen Brothers film, you may be tad disappointed. Yet, definitely, this film is worth a watch. A 3/5 for this.",6,0,0,24 August 2014
Braveheart," Titles, money, gold!! Slaves are made out of these not free men.
","Titles, money, gold!! Slaves are made out of these not free men.A dialogue that relates to all living today who aspire for the afore mentioned three. We are made slaves and most are in fact leading a life of slavery under the veils of freedom.A movie that is like a clichéd warrior story if you have seen Benhur, Spartacus and one thats designed Barry Lyndon may not be a good watch but this rises with a Brave Heart, the script has got all in it to make it a perfect piece of cinema that compromises a little but nevertheless, breathes it's heart out. It's one heck of war and period film that I would rate as a must see for costume designers, for art directors and for cinematographers who aspire to make a period film. And for all others, its a story that is of inspiration that's made with a courage.To attempt to see such a long film in itself these days is an act of bravery I must say, coz we are men who don't have patience and who want everything steadfast. But all accolades to Mel Gibson who in nearly 3 hours has shown his passion and exemplified by showing glory. The Battle of Stirlington, or aWar of Filkark, those are war pieces that will stand the test of time in cinema history and may be regardes as a finest depiction of the gore the pain that war is. Acted supremely well by all, this is easily one of the best textbooks of showing controlled emotion just with eyes at times. The music supplements the emotion and thanks to James Horner for the music that he gave. I have this movie in my OST collection too. Few scenes like the affair between Wallace and Isabella or the king throwing off Phillip may have been cut and even the length may not make everyone its admirer so a tad short and this will be easily watchable by many more is what I believe. But still, a greatly made movie in all its near three hours running time. My rating is 4/5. Blu ray just made this one so better to see. Thanks to the transformation too.",8,2,5,20 September 2014
Her," Lover or loner this will suffice the needs of both.
","A heart touching love story where the girl is not to be seen, only heard. It's music to ears. Lover or loner this will suffice the needs of both.Though I watched this film as a download earlier with the fear that it may not release, I was supremely happy to see it release and watched it alone amidst lovers. Was wondering if there can be a better date than such a romantic movie on a full moon night.I am a loner and a happy one,Now, as I say I am a loner, I have 3 indeed 4 women to make love with, that's Movies, Music and Books added with my Camera. I am happy coz these do not expect anything back from me and just keep giving me joys. Expectations are the root cause of most disappointments and thankfully I have been less subjected to them. Companionship brings joys for sure but if it does not go well life is ruined miserably. However strong a company maybe through phone or chatting, unless it becomes physical and culminates organically, it is vulnerable and there is fear of falling apart too. So just let me rephrase what I said, I am a lover and a happy one too and yet I go through a fear of falling apart. Companionship is a prime most desire of any human being and after a certain age most humans desire a companion who can satisfy the physical desires. Spike Jonze is the first person, I would like to speak about in my review. And this not for his direction but for his screenplay. He wrote a script himself and has used wonderful scenes to make it interesting. Theodre Twombly the character played superbly by Joaquin Phoenix is a character who is seeking company in his life. He gets Samantha (voice of Scarlett Johansson), an advanced operating system that is artificially intelligent, as his company. Their relationship hits all the right notes and blossoms beautifully. I must say just for the voice of Scarlett Johannson, she must be given best voice over award. The fine nuances of emotions are expressed superbly in voice modulations.Shot superbly by Hoyte van Hoytema and put together wonderfully by 2 editors, this is beautiful, but the pace is a bit slow and it takes time to sink in.This is not a feel good film but is extremely romantic film. There a lot of romantic moments in the film but they are shot with Joaquin alone as there is only voice of the girl. I loved the dialogs between them and they are so connecting too. Most of us would have through such moments in relationship. A 4/5 for this, except being tad slow I am all for love and romance. Kudos to Spoke Jonze for perceiving it and then making it uncompromisingly with his own unique vision.",8,0,1,23 August 2014
Goodfellas," The greatest Gangster film that I have seen, it does something that even The Godfather, did not do.
","The greatest Gangster film that I have seen, it does something that even The Godfather, did not do.Here is a film on organized crime that is having a voice over of it's protagonist for good amount of time and it makes the film all the more interesting. I love many shots in the film, like the conversation shots between Paulie and Henry, or the way jokes of Joe Pesci are captured or even the murders. Damn, this is all very realistic and it's admirable to have achieved it this way. Indeed at times it plays like a documentary unlike a fiction film. Also, the film is told in first person not only by Henry but also by his wife Karen. Damn, it makes the film reliable and real.The performances are superb, each detail, each nuance is done well, nothing seems out of place, a jaw dropping murder of rib tickling joke, all seem so natural in emotions here. Joe Pesci gets out some wonderful lines. Robert DeNiro is extremely cold blooded as Jimmy. Paul Sorvino as Paulie is authoritative. Loranne Bracco as Karen is loving. Ray Liotta as Henry is infectious and fragile. There is a host of other characters that are wonderful too. We must understand that these characters actually existed in reality and from their interviews was the book, Wise Gy written by Nicolas Pilleggi. GoodFellas was based on this book only. Scorsese is indeed the most interesting director of our times, who takes varied themes and puts it all in the pan and cooks it so well that the dish surely tastes delicious.To showcase power, he takes an interesting point where Henry takes his Karen into a restaurant by surpassing the crowd, going through the back door and a table is literally lifted and placed for them. To showcase guilt, Scorsese uses conversation between Jimmy and Henry. To showcase crime, he shows us just a few gunshots and how emotionless the killer is. Damn, all this makes it such interesting and a fun film. The camera movement is adept and so is the cinematographer. But to dive the camera and the cameraman, the director is needed. Scorsese precisely is such director. This is not actually a Gangster film, I will rather call it as a film that is made on Organised Crime in a throughly interesting way and with eccentric and interesting characters. Of course, the cast does get all the chords right and takes the characters into a new level.It is indeed long with a length of 140 minutes, but it's an easy film for a movie buff. But for the non-aficionados the characters names and the length may take a toll. But I will say, most film-goers have considered this a good film as per ratings all over, thus even the claim that it is lengthy can be cut off. I am giving 5/5 for this wonderful film, that is self indulgent at times, but the best part is that it indulges you as viewer. Kudos to the master Scorsese for this.",10,0,0,7 September 2014
The Martian," The promise of the first ten minutes was thrown away in this overly long film.
","The promise of the first ten minutes was thrown away in this overly long film.I loved the initial ten minutes which set up the film nicely, but after that, it dragged to a predictable point and was very lame by the end. It's is smart in terms of setup and the whole creation of Mars, but it's lame in the screenplay and added uncalled for points. Certainly, it brought out of the best of Matt Damon, the leading man. But, I am not so sure that it brought the best in others too. The supporting cast was just doing their part and they did not enthuse me much. The special effects were amazing, given the budget and the director Ridley Scott who was a proved Sci-fi master. Thanks to Ridley as he added some drama and fun. Else, this would have just been another survival story. The humor in this film is surely commendable.Also, there is very little science jargon in this, it helps a layman understand. Unlike Interstellar which had too much of science jargon, that made it abstruse. The Martian keeps the dialogue simple and relatable which for sure is nice. My biggest qualm is the length of the film, which could have been trimmed easily by 20 minutes. Other than this, I am fine with most of what I saw. Indeed happy in parts too. A 3/5 for a certainly good film, that could have been so much better. Perhaps one viewing is recommended if not a repeat watch.",6,3,7,18 January 2016
Up in the Air," For a traveller like me flying means a lot but this film made me re think as to how much do we need to travel.
","For a traveller like me flying means a lot but this film made me re think as to how much do we need to travel.It made me ask, how much we should do for what? The movie comes across in various layers, a man who flies and is bent on collecting the flyer miles, a man who wants to walk down the aisle on his sister's wedding, a man who sits at a place to fire people. Now it's the same and he has same kind of charisma and persona and a great dignity and in everything he does. He has a very understated style but nevertheless a style for sure.It's not a comedy, it's serious that does not make it a sob sob, it's a drama relevant to todays times. How do you feel if fired from a company? This film makes and observant look on such emotions but at the same not indulging much as it has got various other things to look at. I am happy to have seen this and each time I saw (3 in all for now) it brought to me the facets of a character that are so humane. This movie is very smart and slick and has all in it to be considered a modern classic. It is not cult but it's one that deserves a watch fly and fly higher in the air.It's 3/5 for a movie that is so very relevant in the times that we live.",6,2,2,20 September 2014
V for Vendetta," A thoroughly adventitious, thought provoking film.
","A thoroughly adventitious, thought provoking film. It glorifies anarchist and nihilistic feelings within.The scene where V (Hugo Weaving) introduces himself to Evey (Natalie Portman) is in itself a masterpiece in dialog writing.V: The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V. Evey Hammond: Are you, like, a crazy person? V: I am quite sure they will say so. But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking with? Evey Hammond: I'm Evey.After reading that absolutely mind blowing piece of writing, I really doubt if whatever I review here is read or even pertinent. But on a more personal note, It's important to me as a person to stand up to something, stand up to my conviction, my own beliefs and disbelief's, to stand up to my own self, that has made me. To stand in itself is a great thing but to stand up against everything, demands a character. A character that may be disliked, ostracized but shall nonetheless have one person who embraces it and who shall become the company of him or her for as long as he is alive. Now, the question that always bugs me how me do have character, how many question, how many seek the truth, how many seek reason.The answer as it stood always is hardly any. The reason is most men and women are molded by beliefs that some others (be it parents, society, teachers) have embedded in them, but should they seek reason, they might have their own varied reasons and that would make him 'HIM' or her 'HER'. I cannot put this succinctly but I hope you are getting what I am trying to convey. I was told that 9 hours stay is a rule put in office, I asked for a reason, I was presented with one, I did not buy that reason, so I do not follow that rule. So am I an anarchist? Yes coz I do not follow rules that are not substantiated with reason. But still I have my own little discipline, my job pays me something, so I have to give back what I am expected to from my job. So that's the discipline I follow and the only thing indeed. OK, now let me sway back to movie, the purpose is to review it, but it triggered such nihilistic and anarchist thoughts that I was bound to put whatever I did above. Hugo Weaving has a voice that is so haunting and manly that even though he wears a Guy Fawkes mask, we know that for sure behind that mask is a man who is strong enough to seek command just by his voice. Hugo Weaving plays V with a command. Natalie Portman as Evey plays her part sublimely well. The way she sleeps in Jail is enough for me to convince she is a good actress. All others, have done exceedingly well in there roles. But what made the movie so special is the environment, the dialog and the way characters are developed, you have a villain, a hero, a heroine and a setup, all are placed well and told us to supremely so that's what makes this a great film. For whoever worked on the fireworks in the film, a big thanks to them, coz they were so gorgeous.I ca't say much but I loved it, I can relate to it coz I am a questioning person, an anarchist myself who has a discipline. You don't break rules that are formed with a reason that are made to make everyone happy and not just a group of people. Like driving on one side of road, not breaking signals etc. But rules formed without a proper reason, rather a reason your conviction does not buy then it need not be followed.By rating this film, a 5/5 I am just completing a mere formality. But I warn each one of you (those reading this) to give this film some time coz this is not an instantaneously engrossing film, it grows with time. Inside most of us we sure have a V, but sadly we forget that there is one and succumb to the comforting herd called the world.",10,2,4,7 September 2014
