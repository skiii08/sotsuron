The Devil's Advocate," -
","Too bad that Keanu reeves has been chosen for this magnificent film. Thanks to that, this film by times feels like watching 'SPEED' or 'The Matrix' for he presents his character in the same way he does the others. I wouldn't call it bad acting, but he shouldn't keep on doing it because new challenges will only make it more obvious that he reached his limit. Especially when the other members of the cast put down a performance like they did in 'The Devil's Advocate'. They on the other hand make up for the uncreative acting performance of their colleague, making this film one worth to watch! Good story, great monologues, nice effects and good acting performances of most of the cast. One does not even have to be religious to agree with what this film brings. Proved by great literature in history, Vanity can be fruitful... as a subject.",7,0,1,3 March 2007
