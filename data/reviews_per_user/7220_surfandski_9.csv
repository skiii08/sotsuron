Requiem for a Dream," You ever thought about using hard drugs? Here's your lesson
","Really good movies are hard to watch, this is one of them, the path to ruin of its characters is slowly drawn but unwaivering. These are not your stereotypical junkies, this are people that you would met on the street and give no second thought about what there true affliction is. It is a grim film, a bit slow, repetitious a some points, but it lets you experience total disaster in progress. Ellen Burstyn is outstanding as the lonely, apartment bounded New Yorker. This movie has as its central theme the destruction that drugs to individual and the people around them, but it is much, much more, it is about the frivolity of TV and the circus it has become, it is about the the social discarding of our senior citizens, about the insignificance of the individual (tinny figures filmed against big building). This movie is like an individual in a busy landscape, the subject is drugs and destruction, but the backdrop is just as interesting. Watch it, you'll be richer for it. 8/10.",8,0,0,16 December 2002
American History X," Simply put...awesome ! The best movie of 1998.
","This is the kind of movie that is so good you want everyone to watch it. Edward Norton gives a stunning whale of a performance as a chilling working class, articulate skinhead neo-nazi whose racial hate soaks anything and anyone on the screen. He was robbed at the Ocars. The only flaw in this movie is a couple of miscasts, Elliot Gould and Edward Furlong, this might be personal but I just don't know how these two have an acting career. In any case, this is drama at is best, with an awesome script, perfect delivery, and a beautiful combination of color and black and white filming. Watch it! 10/10",10,0,0,10 November 2002
Mulholland Drive," For David Lynch fans only...
","What can I say, I was really looking forward to this movie but it just didn't do it for me. I was not bored, this is not a boring movie, but all I can say is that having seen all of Lynch movies...there is nothing new here. If you are familiar with Lynch's movies you'll know what I mean, creepy characters, a great score, extreme close ups, great looking women, freaky men, first rate acting, and a story that keeps dragging you in because if it is this good then the payoff is going to be great...but no great payoff. As always a couple of memorable scenes, a hit that gets insanely screwed up, club Silencio, and many more. I am not sorry I saw it, but with all the hype I expected more.",8,0,1,2 September 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Original, well acted, yet inconsistent...
","You have to give it to Charlie Kauffman, his scripts are very, very original, almost as if he is trying to outsmart himself (Adaptation, Being John Malkovic, and now Sunshine...), however they always have this quality of leaving you a bit empty, because he always starts so strong maybe his endings lose a lot of the punch, or he just does not want to deliver one. In any case, this is a good movie. The acting is superb, Carey and Whinslet have a perfect chemistry here, and although not much is shown, much is perceived. I think that looking at 50% of the audience giving this movie a 10 is overrating it. What are you going to leave for the Godfather, or the Quiet American? 7/10",7,0,1,22 April 2005
Saw," Yeah baby, this is the one you have been waiting for !
","This movie is the balls. Just when you are tired of watching the same crappy rehash of stories that you can predict what is going to happen for the next 30 minutes here comes this dandy that locks you in right from the start, and I mean RIGHT FROM THE START. Yeah sure the killer has planned things a little too perfect but it doesn't take away from the original script, and to cap it all off you have a great twist(S) at the end. This is a story where the overlap between present and flashbacks is perfectly done, it actually enhances the flow of the film rather than detract or distract from it. It reminded me of the Usual Suspects in the cleverness of the script and the final twist(s), even though the subjects matter is completely different. The way in which people 'must' die or kill is in every case perverse and brilliant. I am not much for this type of movie but this one left me wanted for more. I have not seen Saw II but after seeing this one, I am gonna have to watch it, doubt it can come even close. For sheer entertainment value Saw gets a 9.",9,0,1,10 January 2006
Mystic River," BRILLANT...NOT !!!
","I really wanted to like this movie but, this movie is so mediocre that is even hard to write a review about it. What the fuss is all about is beyond me. The performances are mediocre at best, with the exception of Tim Robbins which puts out a great one. Starting with Marcia Gay Harding, when they get into the 'vampire' dialog it is hard not to laugh at her. Then there is Laura Liney, why she thinks that people in Boston speak like southerners??? Then there is the editing, this movie just does not flow right, I can't put my finger on it other than it is all wrong. Then the music, it reaches crescendos at the most inapropriate times and then we have a couple of blues tunes courtesy of Kyle Eastwood that should have been left in the trash bin.I was really psyched to see this movie, I had read the book and eventhough the book is not well written, the basis of the story is very good and I thought it would make a great movie, ohhh but leave to the screenwriters of this dog to screw that up, even the ending is all wrong. In the book there is a real reason about why the girl is killed, in the movie they change it to a bogus reason, read the spoiler at the end. Do yourself a favor, skip this turkey. This is 5/10 and I am being generous.SPOILERThe reason the girl is killed is because the mute brother of her boyfriend does not want his brother to marry her and leave the house since he is very attached to him, thus he kills her. In the movie they make it an accidental shooting and they top it off with an accidental beating?????????????  Talk about extreme PC towards mute people.",5,2,3,20 October 2003
Mystic River," A total disappointment, waaaaaaay over rated. Save your money
","I was looking forward to this movie. There was so much hype about it, and after reading the book which I considered to be a very good story line that was not well written I figured that it could play really well as a movie. Boy was I ever wrong. For starters, with the exception of Tim Robbins performance which is very good, the rest of the performances are quite mediocre, the worst being Marcia Gay Harding's. You can't believe how bad it goes on the  'vampires' scene you hardly can contain your laughter, and last but not least Laura Linney who thinks that Bostonians speak like southerners????????? What's up with that ! The score is another flaw in the movie it rises to angelic heights at the worst of times and there are some blues tunes courtesy of Kyle Eastwood that should only be played when teaching how-NOT-to play the blues. On top of it, the real reason for why the girl is murdered, which I will give at the end as a spoiler, is changed in the movie to something completely bogus. Why they would do that is beyond me but it completely devalues the whole story. This is a long novel and a long movie, yet the flow of the story is just off, I don't know why and how but you'll know what i mean if you watch it. Folks, anyone that is giving this movie a rating higher than 7 must be caught in the last 5 year trend of media smooching towards Clint Eastwood films. This movie is just dull. 5/10...and I am being generous.SPOILER AHEADThe reason the girl is murder is because the young mute brother does not want his older brother to leave, since his brother is planning to marry the girl and leave, he kills her to keep the brother at home. In the movie the murder is attributed to an accidental shooting and the stealing of a car, which plays out as such a lame excuse that you have to contain yourself from throwing crap at the screen. Is this PC towards mute people, who the hell knows, but it just makes the whole story line so freaking lame.",5,0,1,18 October 2003
Vanilla Sky," A great cast deliver an excellent story in top form.
","Vanilla Sky is an excellent adaptation of the Spanish film Abre los Ojos (open your eyes, which I have also seen). What Vanilla Sky has over the original is excellent performances from all its cast members. Along with Magnolia, this is probably Tom Cruise best performance, I am not a great fan of his commercial work, but you have to respect the man here. His facial expressions are a joy to watch in every shot, it is a great, underrated performance, like George Clooney's performance in Solaris. Cameron Diaz also shines as the 'villain'. I agree with a reviewer here which says that the music was distracting, even though the soundtrack is excellent, it is not appropriate, it seems as if Crowe is trying to make a video of every sequence. However do not let this minor issue stop you from seeing this movie. One of the great things about Vanilla Sky is that although the movie may seem confusing to some, everything is brought together at the end WITHOUT CHEATING. Many movies nowadays tend to get away from a straight narrative, nothing wrong with that, but with a script so full of holes that you could not put it together even with crazy glue, using the BS excuse that they will 'leave it up to the viewer to figure out what they really mean' or 'if you look carefully, it is all there'. Not here. In short, a great surprise from a movie I was not expecting much. 8/10",8,0,1,17 January 2004
Sin City," Visually stunning, highly entertaining
","I have never read the stories that this movie is based upon so I could not comment on how it compares. That might be a plus since I got to experience this movie with no background information. An it was awesome. All stories in the movie are very good, but I believe it is Mickey Rorke's plot line which is the best part of this film, I think they should have put that story as the 3rd of 4 story lines, rather than 2nd (could not have been 4th because of the plot line) because it is so sooooo good that what follows, although very good, is no match. The look of the film is superb, the combination of black and white with color is stunning, the cars look real but with a story line look to them (check out the headlight of the car that flies through the air, little oval beams in front of it).",8,0,1,3 January 2006
