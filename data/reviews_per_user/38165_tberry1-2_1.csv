Lucky Number Slevin," Snappy dialog, well acted, and a new breed of Gangster Flick
",Lucky # Slevin got going as soon as the previews ended. The dialog was very smart and witty with the occasional pun for added humor. Hartnett's best role since Black Hawk Down. The 'twist' in the end is a bit too predictable. A very quotable movie that will probably see HUGE success when its released on DVD. Both roles.The Boss and The Rabbi could have been written better. Bruce Willis plays a Jackal type assassin excellently and will have you guessing as to which side hes really on the entire movie. Lucy Lui and Hartnett have very well acted scenes together and sparks fly. Adds a fresh new twist on the gangster genre.,10,1,7,11 April 2006
