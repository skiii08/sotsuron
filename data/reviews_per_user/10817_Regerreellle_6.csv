Ford v Ferrari," Masterful no sjw nonsense here
","Great cast, great script, just works on every level as a fun and complex father/son story. Watch this on a big screen!",10,8,15,8 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Fire Kathleen Kennedy and bring George back pleasssse
","Lord have mercy, how can a film be this bad. This is not canon, it cannot be canon. Disney has finally did it, theyve ruined my childhood. So uninspiring, bringing back palpatine was just really disrespectful to george lucas and the fans of star wars. KK is a sith lord and she really needs to go, shes a feminist parasite that deserves to be destroyed from lucasfilm. Im really glad they dont give her much power anymore.",3,8,12,22 May 2020
The Shining," Overrated Horror
","Unfortunately it did not, but now I know what I don't like most about these movies: it's the terrible pacing. Despite having all the time in the world, Kubrick is simply incapable of escalating the tension gradually. I felt the same thing during A Space Odyssey where nothing happened for hours and then the computer went crazy in a span of 5 minutes.Here, Jack Torrance who is obviously supposed to go crazy gradually during their stay seems to be mad right from the start, so the director basically skips the interesting part. This also means that he can't really take the character any further and even Jack Nicholson's cartoonish overacting gets boring after a while, and you're just waiting for the never-ending chase scene to be over so you can move on to other things.Simply, overrated.",6,0,1,22 May 2020
Django Unchained," Tarentino being self indulgent
",God Tarantino you're arrogant.How does this guy keep getting great reviews the stupidity of his films are untouchable. Films not even in the realm of reality. Pulp fiction was cool because I could picture those guys actually speaking the way they did. Django there's no way in heck. Don't get me started and how dumb the hateful eight was.,5,0,0,22 May 2020
The Shape of Water," Beautiful and Haunting
","This is easily Del Toro's masterpiece. The Background Score - Hauntingly Beautiful. Cinematography - Brilliant and blue is my favorite color. Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins are great in their interactions and Michael Shannon is menacing as his authoritative and dominant character. It was simply a love story between a god-like sea creature and a mute, timid girl and that last shot was mesmerizing. A MUST SEE!!!!",8,1,7,22 May 2020
It Chapter Two," Disappointed in how it ended
","I have been a massive Stephen King fan since a teenager and loved the original TV movie of IT. Whilst part 1 of the IT remake was very good, part 2 has been a massive let down. Story seems to have given way to a special effects showcase and what story there is has deviated from the book. If you love Stephen King's work, then avoid this movie at all costs.",3,1,2,22 May 2020
