The New World," Absolute Masterpiece!
","This movie was stunning from beginning to end, a true piece of art that gave so much attention to the emotional and cultural aspects of the movie. Q'orianka Kilcher (Pocahontas)was made for this role she did not have to talk (which she didn't in the majority of the first part of the movie) to create some great cinema moments.Be warned in my opinion this is not a recommended watch for 'part-time cinema lovers' you may be left disappointed but however I also believe this movie has a unique for individual people, so it may 'transform' you.Excellent movie10 out of 10",Null,0,1,4 April 2011
Stranger Than Fiction," Much deeper message involved in this picture then let off
","I just finished watching this title as part of my 'Christmas TV watch'. I did not know anything about this movie prior to watching it just that Will Ferrell, who I think of as an intriguing actor on many different levels, starred in it. This movie is clever, comical, dramatic, TRAGIC, enlightening and philosophical in all ways. Will Ferrell's character has been designed in such a way that the allows the audience to relate to it with ease.In my opinion one of the ultimate goals this movie hoped to achieve was too to try make obvious to the audience the systemic and enforced view on life we have.",10,0,0,25 December 2010
