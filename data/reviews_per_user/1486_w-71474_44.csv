Black Swan," Evil flower
","1. Color and clothing
The metaphor of color is the most common and obvious.
White, pink: white swan, Nina. Black: Black Swan, Mother, Lily, Beth. Grey: The only actor-Thomas, the artistic director of the dance company.
White: Nina 's pillows are black and white patterned, and in multiple dreaming overhead shots, her head is just resting on the center of the entangled black vine pattern; her snow-white scarf is fluffy and is a white swan feather The symbol of Ling is like a fledgling fledgling young bird. (This fluffy dress symbolizes purity, and I have seen it in 'Single Man' not long ago: Kenny, who represents the Angel of Redemption, played by Nicholas Holt, is wearing such a soft white sweater.)
Pink: Almost all of Nina 's rooms are decorated in pink; on the first morning, the breakfast served by her mother was cut in half. Nina murmured like a little girl: 'Pink, how beautiful!'
Nina's mobile phone appeared many times, and you can see the word 'MOM' appearing on her mobile phone screen, the background color is pink.
When Nina curled up alone in the corridor to practice her arm movements, the scarf was pale pink.
After she was chosen as the 'Queen of Swan', the fluffy scarf disappeared, a symbol of the fluff of chicks.
--However, when Nina was seduced by Thomas and was thrown, she sat in front of the mirror and wept. At that time, the fluffy scarf appeared again, it should be a metaphor for her to wander at this time, and returned to the state of shrinking chicks.
Gray: After she had frequent hallucinations, the top she wore when she was dancing changed from white to gray; her home clothes also became gray-grey penetrated Nina 's pink world.
In the bar, Lily gave Nina a black sexy vest. Nina put it outside the white dress. One night after taking the hallucinogenic drugs, Nina's sweater turned completely dark gray.
In Nina's 'white period', her shoes were blunt, non-aggressive and ambitious gray cotton snow boots. In contrast to her were 'black swan' Lily's gorgeous black leather boots.2. Swan
The swan is a complex and strange image, which can represent purity, but it can also be a carnal incarnation: the god Zeus, the god of the gods of Sparta, was dumped by the beauty of Lida, the wife of Tingdarius of Sparta, and became a swan and his wild union. The swan's white carcass, soft long neck, soft feathers, and full-bodied body can also be regarded as the ultimate combination of female sexuality.
Another symbolism of the swan is the artist's poetic and beautiful incarnation. Sheng Sang's 'Swan's Death' and the proverb 'Swan Song' all use this meaning.
The image of the swan in this film is ubiquitous. Throughout the 'Swan Lake' music, the whole film is like a musical. In addition, there are Nina's cell phone ringtones, and the music box with the swan lake rhythm and ballet villain.
In the last leap, Nina, who was completely white, finally returned to the pure white world (white sponge cushion) with the wound of the black swan.
'Perfect. I got perfect.'
After experiencing the double suffering of spirit and flesh, the black swan and the white swan are united in the entanglement, creating a perfect situation and enjoying peace.",10,0,1,16 April 2020
Howl's Moving Castle," Want to have a mobile castle
","'Hall's Moving Castle' is by far Miyazaki's most profound work. This cartoon jumps in plot, and the metaphor is overwhelming, which is completely different from Miyazaki's past dense and popular narrative style. Part of the audience said that the plot is difficult to understand-this is the purpose of this article. I think this is a great movie, and I want to write down my experience and share it with all readers who love Hayao Miyazaki and the flames of idealism still in their hearts.Hal's moving castle is a city that has not yet flown to the sky, and Hal is our ghost prince, and Ambergawa who lost his name. Our Sophie has a pair of eyes that are always pure, no matter what color her hair will be, or whatever her name is.Innocence and loss, the eternal theme, also eternally awaken my dream. The so-called magic is not to weave a dream, let you walk in, but it seems to be true. Miyazaki is the greatest magician he encountered in his life.I traveled through the clouds because you held my hand, I breathed smoothly because you said you will come back, I hugged you because you gave me a breeze kiss.",9,0,0,11 April 2020
Your Name.," I don't like it very much, the plot is very common
","There are many highlights. Unfortunately, after shaking off the burden, the core turned out to be an old stalk of a vulgar and hypocritical girl in love. The last subway interlaced to recognize what really made me stale. The so-called 'your name' is terribly overworked, and it is embarrassing in the end. 'Qian and Qianxun' also talked about 'your name'. Qianxun was forced to erase his name and became Xiaoqian. Xiaobailong retrieved her name. The meaning of the name here is a positioning and return to self-existence, a reflection on the question of essence and ontology of 'who am I'. And 'Your Name' doesn't say anything, it is a pure girl love anime movie, and it deliberately consumes the girl's heart. The gap is so great that I can't compare the two movies.
On feelings about nature and tradition, they disappeared completely in the later period, and they were top-heavy. Instead, they felt indifferent. Not to mention comparing with Hayao Miyazaki. No matter which movie Miyazaki made, he never deliberately portrayed the feelings of men and women, but none of the men and women is not impressive. Parker and Hida in 'Sky City', Little White Dragon and Chihiro in 'Thousand and Thousand Seeking', 'Hall's Moving Castle' and Hal and Sophie, etc.
Even if it is the emotion and description of the town, compared with 'Little Forest', it can see a huge gap. After all the scenes turned to Tokyo, the town did disappear.
On the love of girls, it is not as good as 'The Girl Who Traveled Through Time and Space'. The flirty sentence 'I am waiting for you in the future' is more touching than this repeated deliberate ending. On dog blood hypocrisy, it is not as good as 'My Girls' Generation', at least hearty, sweet and sweet. 'Your Name' used the safety of life in a small town to accompany the two to fall in love. It was really depressing. This is too deliberate, too hypocritical, and too hypocritical. Probably I am not young enough.
In the final analysis, the expectations are too high. As far as the films directed by Xin Haicheng are indeed, they are much better than those of the movies he had before, but they should be as good as possible. The Chinese public is too easy to be pleased, and a little jokes are enough to satisfy. A bit of flirtatious sex teasing will make you happy for a long time. In fact, the whole movie's laugh point is almost supported by touching the chest. Maybe it's been a long time since I saw a good-looking anime movie in love. But really, I would rather watch 'Listening to the Ear' a hundred times. If it's just about falling in love, then have a good time and do so many tricks. Even if you focus on the theme 'I've been looking for someone ... we all had an adventure, met someone I liked, but just forgot his / her name', it's better than a hodgepodge in the end.",6,0,0,25 April 2020
The Hunger Games," There can only be one winner of the game
","The hunger game is a game that everyone is not willing to participate in.In this killing game with no humanity, no rules, and no shame, the purpose of the game is just to make people forget to resist and lose their humanity.One of the most important rules of the hunger game is: only one survives.This man returned Yijin to the 'privilege, wealth, reputation, prosperity' that the poor compatriots in his hometown envied.Every game, everyone will watch. In the process of watching, everyone is immersed in it.At this moment there must be countless ideas in their hearts. But under the guns of the army and under the huge screen, there is no way to show ideas.Paying attention to the game itself is the only correct expression.What is suppressed is human nature
Many people expressed their desire to live according to their own wishes, and they did not want to be a pawn at their disposal. They are normal human beings with thoughts, humanity and desires, not desperate hunting machines.It's just that in the end, either look at the distance or choose to die. A certain area can't stand it, it's a riot. They were greeted by repression, slaughter, bloodbath, and company.In the game, the last deceased thinks he understands the rules of the game before dying and thinks the winner is the default. In fact, the outcome of the game does not matter to the president.This supreme commander doesn't care who the dead person is or whoever wins. The only thing he was afraid of was surprise, surprise, and people 's emotions beyond control, their yearning for silencer, and their resistance to bondage.",8,3,4,17 April 2020
The Notebook," That summer is sweet and sweet, forever in my heart
","Summer. Allie and Noah knew the remote but beautiful town in summer. Allie is the sweet southern girl, her smile and kiss are as sweet as her curly blond hair and red dress. So this is another story that happened in summer. She left with her family, so summer ended, but their story is far from over. At that time her parents said that this was just summer love, and it ended soon. Later, the story in this book said that there is always such a summer love, such as shooting star, leaving the most brilliant spark in the night sky. Summer is really a season suitable for love. However, the best love does not happen in summer. It wanders through the seasons and never stops. Only the short-lived joy that ended early will blame the season angrily.That summer was wonderful.

Knives Out," Deep truth
","Let me talk about the filming method first. The film is shown to the audience in the 1990s of the United States, like Renoir 's color painting. The whole article presents the audience with gray, zongzi warm tones. Using this realistic style, To give the audience real credibility and know that the paintings are created with oil paint and canvas, just like the logical reasoning of the film, knowing that it is a movie or giving people a real and credible feeling.
The director has a solid foundation, and many shots reveal the language of the shot intentionally or unintentionally.
Like a knife pierced into the center of a donut, this movie is sweet and bloody, giving people a light and agile, sometimes 'roller coaster' style viewing experience. It can make people fully immersed in the purest ornamental nature of such suspense comedy, and it can show social problems by showing a lot of details without preaching.",8,0,1,5 April 2020
Children of Heaven," Running, in the name of love
","The camera suddenly slowed down, and Ali's blue sweatshirt shook and swayed in the wind. His face was deformed due to nervousness, his head unsteadily swaying from side to side following his footsteps, and the sweat slipped unconsciously along the temples. In the silence, I could only hear the sound of 'tap' and 'tap' in the footsteps and their breathing which was thick and rapid due to lack of oxygen. When there was almost no energy, some words began to echo in his mind. 'How can I go to school without shoes?' 'Come on, Sarah, hurry.' 'I will win the third place for you, definitely.' So I looked at He took a very tense step, surpassing the previous ones step by step. Step by step, as if desperately, tears dripped down.It was a depression in Ali's heart. He owed his sister a pair of shoes, which he lost because of him. So he used all his energy to run, just want to get the third prize, a pair of sneakers. Five thousand kilometers is like a marathon to a 9-year-old child. He has never received any training or guidance and won the championship. It was the hard and pressing life condition on weekdays that created him, and the conviction given to him by deep love and responsibility turned into the strength of his persistence in the most difficult times.Running, in the name of love. Life, in the name of love.
The tone of the film has always been calm and calm, clean, without excessive words and emotions, like the clear eyes of Iranian children. The life of the people at the bottom is bitter. A family with three children has been overwhelmed by the pressure of life. My mother was seriously ill and my father complained constantly. However, no one in this family has lost confidence in life and is not disoriented. They have the collective expression of poor people all over the world, cowardly, kind, and forbearing. They silently endured the difficulties of life, and silently released their inner strong nature. They won't crumble and collapse because of a little setback. Because resistance and struggle are actually not the subject of life. As long as they can afford it, they will definitely not break out. People at the bottom of life will always bear the humiliation most. However, this film is far from, or not intended to tell us all at all. Unlike many political films we have seen, it tells us that such deep-seated social causes. If you superficially speculate on the director's mind and wait to understand the real intention of the film, you will definitely be ashamed and feel sad for your institutionalized brain consciousness.The film does not discuss equality, freedom, or simply does not want to be entangled in topics that are seriously concerned in the institutional sense. In front of life, the director only opened one eye, calm and objective. Yes, life is not fair. Even a seemingly equal long-distance race has a vicious hand pulling behind. But Ali got up again, he just wanted to run, and as long as he was running third, what a sad black humor.Please remember that such a director, he may be very happy to be friends with people like Zhuangzi, thinking of high house building, freehand and ethereal, full of humanity, the glory of the naked child. He didn't want to tell us how cruel our lives were, or suggested that we resist all kinds of arrangements. He probably didn't want to tell us anything at all. He just showed us the peaceful and gentle side of humanity, shaming us, thinking deeply, and encouraging us.",10,0,0,13 May 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Assumptions will become true
","Who is Dr. Qi Ai? The senior scientific personnel employed by the US government are responsible for the development of high-tech nuclear weapons for the Cold War and a series of related attack and defense systems. A German American. A paralyzed man in a shadow, in a wheelchair. A person with abnormal movements wearing black leather gloves on his right hand. A remnant of Nazis mixed in with the US government. A man controlled by a demon. Yes demon. Just as Chadayev was not a mind, but a spirit, a spirit controlled by demons. The Nazis, the Communist Party, the Soviets, the American spirit, capitalism, and patriotism are all demons. They promote a kind of hatred, weak meat and strong food, the hatred of the fittest. A kind of hatred preached in the name of worshiping power. They call it love. Patriotic and loving leader Yunyun. Therefore, the country must be strong, engage in a nuclear race, and overwhelm the enemy. Leaders want to create God, omnipotence, perfection, all words are truth.
An impotent arrogant, an over-trained pilot (a nuclear war hero? What does a cowboy hat imply?), A nuclear bomb hidden in an underground mine after the surface of the earth was enveloped by nuclear radiation The contested American general, a powerless American president stuck in a quagmire, a national regime that has developed a machine that destroys the world. In the film, everything that is absurd, ridiculous, and horrifying is the product of the demon being worshipped by humans.
Now that the Cold War is over, the Nazis are over, and the Soviet Union is disintegrating. So can we watch this movie in a more relaxed mood? I think it's unlikely. Because all the details shown in the film are still established.",10,1,2,15 May 2020
Shutter Island," The story of peaks and turns, cold when I think back
","This movie is really, I have seen it once before, and many doubts have not been solved. Now look at it again, the suspense part is still very good, and I still think a lot after watching it. Although some are still confused, if I fully understand, maybe I am a mental patient.The opening two starring and soundtracks are exaggerated and heavy, and the background is somber, letting people follow the plot into the movie. Although suspenseful, but the tension and compact interpretation of the director and the actor, the film was achieved. The rhythm is smooth, and the plot is promoted with a small climax. It dilutes the dullness caused by the dark tones and obscure themes to the greatest extent. The final reversal of the movie ending is, in the reason, unexpected, and the details echo back and forth. A psychological movie.",10,0,0,2 April 2020
Life of Pi," Another fantasy world

These elements constitute the important visual arts and theatrical atmosphere of 'Fantastic Drifting of Youth'.

Léon: The Professional," Maybe he is not a good killer, because he is always good
","A killer shouldn't be too kind and don't care about a person. Lyon is not a good killer.
It is often wondered why Lyon brought the pot of greens wherever he went, and why at the last crisis, he still asked Mattier to take care of a plant. What a curious plant. Lulu is the best evidence that Lyon is not a good killer. Luolu represents the weak, those who need protection and care, and the love that Lyon once could not protect. In fact, Lyon wanted to love someone, protect her, take care of her, and care for her. If that person doesn't show up, then he has to fill this emptiness with a pot of green dill. Mattier was like a pot of green lush flowers, filling his wounded heart.
The spiral staircase, brown and black, reveals the simple and solemn and depressed atmosphere. Step by step up the stairs, rotate, rotate, lost with the rotation of the stairs, at the end of the rotation, an elf-like girl is waiting quietly. Unruly smoking a cigarette, pretending to have a mature conversation. In the beginning, it is often inadvertent.
Knowing that in your own identity, it is best not to provoke the police who are not as good as crazy dogs. However, in the face of Matil's cry of begging, his cold heart began to melt. The door opened, Lyon greeted Matil, giving her a haven, and at the same time giving her lonely heart a chance to redeem.
As a result, this elf-like, mature and naive girl stubbornly stuck in Lyon's life and would never leave again. She stubbornly asked him to avenge his brother, stubbornly asked him to teach her 'clean up', stubbornly asked him to love her, care about her, and stubbornly transformed his life.",10,1,3,28 March 2020
The Revenant," The cruel epic under the beautiful scenery
","The first thing to say is that 'Wild Hunter' is an amazing masterpiece. Director Gonzalez's last year's film 'Birdman' has made many uncles cry and love it, and this new work has more The fierce and brutal temperament is very shocking. Furthermore, the photography of the film is also unparalleled. The photographer ('Birdman' and 'Gravity' photographer) is good at long and rotating lenses. Unparalleled magnificent wonders, wilderness scenes, vast and magnificent.The background of the story is set in the United States in the 19th century. The opening conflict between the Indian tribes and the whites ignited the first climax. Among the mountains and forests, sneak attacks and resistances, chases and defeats. Under the lens of Lubezki, the cruel western story begins . Xiao Li's performance began to be exciting only in the paragraph of the human war. The perfect CG technology makes every hair of the big bear truly abnormal. Xiao Li's wailing and resistance are extremely weak under the big bear's breath and covet. The audience feels worried when they go down. This scene is presented in the form of close-up and close-up. It is full of presence and has a huge impact.Like the Odyssey deep in the jungle and snowy mountains, it also has the crazy temperament of 'The Wrath of Achill God', plus the mysterious color of the Indian tribe, and even the original atmosphere like 'The Wilderness', this film can be described as very unique and style. The director did not rush to express his thoughts, but placed the audience in the cold enough to be bone-shattering, in the hunger and cold, under the panic like a prey, and witnessing the killing of his son and his betrayed despair. Among them, to experience the cruel fate of the character.",10,0,1,16 April 2020
The Shining," The Shining
","The horror of 'The Shining' comes from the psychological portrayal and torture of human nature, from the clever design and grasp of the plot, the skillful use of music language, and the portrayal of the two leading actors into the wood three points.At the beginning of the film, Danny saw the scene of the two girls and had planted the seeds of terror in the audience's hearts; when Jack embraced the rotten corpse in the conjecture of Room 237, the elements of terror gradually surfaced on paper; When filled with the draft of 'All work and no play makes jack a dull', everyone knew that terror was about to happen; and when Jack stepped up to Wendy on the stairs, the terror struck! Afterwards, Jack carried his axe to kill his wife and daughter for a period of honor that was worthy of the most horrible episode in film history.Jack Nicholson 's performance in the film is superb, and his stern face alone is enough to make you creepy. Its facial expression is more distorted than the clown in Batman 1 and its psychological portrayal is better than that of 'Flying Over the Madhouse The performance of the heroine, decorated by Dewar, is also commendable. The character 's image is very helpful for portraying helpless, weak, but kind women. The pale face, prominent eyes and cheekbones are painful. The expression is very contagious.The role of music in horror movies is very important. This movie is no exception. It suddenly stopped at the climax. The date of the black screen was suddenly switched, which fully aroused the emotions of the audience, and the nerves were always in a state of tension.Especially commendable is the end of the film, Kubrick's end of the film is often tepid, but unique. After Jack froze to death in the snow, the film directly switched to the prom photo of the 'Lookout Hotel' when it was built. The waiter in the center of the photo looks like Jack. Why is it 'like' instead of 'Jack' himself? The date of the photo is 1921.7.4, and at the beginning of the film, the hotel owner once talked to Jack about the tragedy of 1970. It can be seen that there is at least 49 years between them, and Jack can only be around 40 years old at the time, so 'waiter' It will not be 'Jack'; 'Jack' repeatedly mentioned his sense of belonging to the hotel in the film, and it is not difficult to return to the theme of 'Spirit' or reincarnation. Why the date is 7.4, American National Day, at the beginning of the story, Wendy talked about Indian decoration, and the hotel owner also talked about the hotel 's site being a Native American cemetery. When it was built, it was attacked by the Indians many times. The ending of Ball's photo may be Kubrick's cynical mocking, and also implicitly explained the reasons for the tragedy.",10,0,1,22 May 2020

Edward Scissorhands," Can't cut the shape of dream
","This is a sad movie, destined to be a tragedy from the beginning. I don't often like to use the word doomed or be destined to. But you see, since Edward walked out of the castle, everything can only end in tragedy. Everything was full of metaphors, until I saw Edward cut his clothes with scissors in the end, it was like a complete metaphor.I don't know what the director wants to express, but what I see in it is desolation, like a whole desert world. Can't bear a simple, pure Edward.Edward had a lively arrival, everyone's eyes were eager and burning. Edward trims the manor for others, cuts incredible hairstyles for others, he does n't collect money, and he never does anything for it, he just likes it, he just wants to do it, using his scissors, It seems like this should be his born mission.
Lively parties, waiting in line, he thought he just made everyone happy, everyone was satisfied, and everyone accepted himself.

The Intouchables," Have you all the way
","This is a 'very white and black', touching and extremely special story about friendship. It involves many deep meanings such as human nature, equality, respect, trust, friendship and so on. There is a 'super ordinary' friendship between the two heroes, that is, transcending race, class, and normal people.They were adopted, grew up in black neighbourhoods, grew up loitering all day long, relying on unemployment benefits, and even trafficking and robbery to survive. One was a black man who, despite having a high price, suffered many lost children and eventually Painless white man who lost his lover and was paralyzed. Of course, they also have some similarities: one is a person who does not want to be looked down upon, and one is a person who does not want to be sympathized with. It can be said that both of them have failed lives. At first Philip was unable to face life independently because of his physical disability. He was unwilling to contact outsiders. He always 'bullyed' his neighbors and those who only 'careed whether he was alive'. Relatives, he chose to ignore it, leaving the luxury car 'dare' to ride, but reluctant to stay away from his favorite skydiving (he was disabled because of skydiving); and Derris, just released from prison, would rather take unemployment benefits also Unwilling to work, his adoptive mother drove him out of the house because he was disappointed in him. Therefore, they are at least psychologically linked to the disease. Such two seemingly indifferent people have gradually established a deep, special friendship that is hard for others to touch. In the time when they get along, they affect each other, and they all grow up again. Disorders in life can't be eliminated, but as long as we change our attitude to life, we can still change ourselves and make life happy.",10,1,2,29 March 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Write to Gu Yi
","The film runs through a contradictory concept of whether to follow the laws of nature or break the laws of nature. The so-called following is to accept one's own destiny. Paralyzed means paralyzed, and when the hand is abandoned, it is abandoned. Breaking the laws means changing the laws of the world. But the change is temporary, and the final outcome remains the same, just a matter of time.
Gu Yi's character feels like a human God, guarding the earth, and the rebellious disciples and followers are like Satan and other fallen angels who have been thrown into hell. As the truth was revealed, Gu Yi was not a god and had no eternal power. She also let herself live by the power of darkness.
Gu Yi used the power of darkness to fight against darkness and maintain the balance of the earth. In other words, darkness is the destination, struggle and existence of everything, but the faint fire in the darkness is fleeting.
Including the last male host, it also used Dormam's power beyond time and space to be qualified to negotiate with Dormam and protect the earth.
People will disappear after all, as will the earth, even if they are not controlled by Dormam. Compared to Gu Yi's covering up the truth, I prefer Baguio in Zhuxian, frank and open, although he is a cult, but never hides himself. Finally, he used the power of evil to protect his favorite person.
Gu Yi is also, in order to protect the most important things, do not hesitate to resort to darkness. The last words she said touched me very much:I am very nostalgic for this second alive.
No matter how powerful it is, it is still fragile, and it will still be afraid of losing the beauty of this world. After all, death and darkness are eternal. But I cherish this second, this second at the moment, a second in the future, and countless seconds of good memories in the past. Although it is fleeting and has disappeared, I can't hold it and I can't have it.
But as long as I remember, it is eternal in my heart.

Spirited Away," The dream that you and I had
","A friend of mine cried every time he saw Bai Xian eating Chien Chiu's rice ball under the bushes. Many people do not understand, but I am not surprised, because I am the same.Perhaps children without childhood trauma will not understand the touching part of that period. I think maybe every child will imagine that he can have a Bailong friend, he is usually about the same size as himself, and he can play with himself, but when he is in danger, he will transform into a strong Bailong and stand up Out. Yes, that is not surprising. But not every child would have imagined that he was in despair, isolated and helpless, full of strangers with indifferent expressions and deliberate intentions. Of course, it is impossible for them to really encounter such a thing.Chihiro took the train that went back and forth without returning, just like we had the youth that went back and forth, and began her last trip.
That is no longer a passive decision, but a choice made by her independent free will. Now she no longer listens to the instructions of others, she only listens to her inner voice. In fact, the surroundings are still so strange, and all the passengers are all vaguely faced and do not know what to do, and the trip is still uncertain, and there is no more equipment to face the danger on Chihiro 's body. Only one can rely on oneself. However, at that moment, Chihiro had no panic and hesitation. She looked calm and determined. She knew exactly what she wanted and what she was doing.

City of God," Contrast
","The better the music, the crueler the story. This is a contrastThe story begins with a chicken, a chicken running under the butcher's knife.
In the slums of Rio de Janeiro, they also carried guns when chasing chickens that had escaped. This is almost an area where the gun does not leave. This place is called 'The City of God'.
In this urban area, if you choose to be a civilian, then you choose to wait for being robbed; if you choose to be a robber, then you choose to wait for being shot. Which one is better? Many people choose the latter, perhaps because robbery may happen every day, and the shooting only needs to be painful once.
There is no doubt that this is a violent movie. Compared with the 'New York Gangs' released at the same time, 'New York Gangs' is just a violent sugar-coated movie, and 'City of God' is really suffocating, although you can hardly see a drop of red paint in the film. Into the blood.'City of God' is hopeless. In this sunny city, there are shadows cast by the sun: the police are either incompetent or collaborate with the robbers; people who yearn for pastoral life will only die early, even Zie 's Friends, the coolest and calmest robber in the city, Benny can't escape this fate. Benny is cool. He has beautiful girls and a lot of friends, but he has no life to enjoy. He died under a bullet that was supposed to kill Zie.The plot of the film is based on real events-this is really a country full of contrasts, passion and coldness coexist, faith and killing coexist. Actually, where is this not the case? It's just a matter of contrast. If you want to live more comfortably, it is better to calm down and be more realistic, just like the fictional narrator Robert in the film, live in it, shoot the reality with the camera, and then sell it to the newspaper. Aside from the social contradictions such as race problems that individuals are unable to reverse, it is best to live in the present and have a clear grasp of reality.There is another contrast in the film, that is, the darker the skin, the whiter the teeth.",9,0,0,25 April 2020
Gone Girl," Marriage is like a fence, people inside want to go out, people outside want to come in
","Of course, the first thing that is black is marriage, or is exploring the significance of marriage in modern post-industrial society.If interpersonal communication will inevitably lead to competition for rights and lead to the situation of others being hell, then after the establishment of a family, one or both parties are unwilling to effectively fulfill the obligations and responsibilities of childbearing, and members' understanding of the nature of marriage is about to be in trouble.
The focus of the question is, is there any reason why one can feel at ease under the control and control of another person without kinship support. Of course, the movie gives a very dark answer: sexual stimulation, money protection, and the child's consumption of time and energy.In this discussion, romantic love is more like the backward biological traits that humans have not adapted to the post-industrial society: people are forced to fall in love and conclude marriage contracts under the urge of erotic desire, but if marriage is regarded as a small organization, the existence of contract and its The restriction function is to unify the internal conception of the organization, so as to achieve the coordination of motivation and action, so that the organization can improve efficiency when participating in social activities, and continue itself more lastingly; and in the so-called Dink family, when the mating partner The erosion of lust can no longer produce fresh stimuli, but the understanding of life and the pursuit of career are different, and it is impossible to organize joint action. Then the marriage contract only has the framework function to maintain the existence of marriage. This makes some people think of it as a siege, or a prison, or a tomb, which conveys only one meaning: people can no longer see the significance of maintaining the status quo, but they have to maintain the status quo is limited by it, because there is no other choice.",10,0,1,17 April 2020

","The new version of 'The Lion King' uses some pen and ink to interpret the outlook on life relative to the cycle of life.

Call Me by Your Name," Summer Prologue
","Call Me By Your Name is not a complicated story. It's just a short love between two teenagers in summer. But after the overwhelming theme of love has been repeatedly interpreted, this movie can still move people with such a simple narrative, probably because it is the most original presentation of 'love'.In most love stories, there are various resistances, which may come from society, family, time, space, and self ... These resistances are on the one hand a source of dramatic conflict, on the one hand, they also weaken their own love 'Discussion of the kernel. However, the film created a nearly closed space from the beginning.In the summer of 1983, in a small Italian town, complicated mobile communications have not yet invaded people's internal and external spaces. Paper and pens are still common tools for expression and communication, and the time is very slow. Retro double-storey villas, orchards, maids, everything does not need to worry about Elio, he only needs to write music, listen to music, read, eat a bit, and daily chores that may hinder his spiritual life are all insulated from him.The resistance from the family and the outside world in homosexuality has no trace here. Elio's parents are all open-minded intellectuals. They said to Elio: 'Eli baby, you can talk to us about anything, you know.' Sensing his and Oliver's feelings, they just inadvertently expressed their support, not to make Elio feel embarrassed or ashamed.This is a space that can almost be called zero resistance. In addition, it is also beautifully distorted-sunshine, orchard, clear blue sea water, endless apricot juice, young and beautiful flesh, wanton flowing music, philosophical discussions interspersed ... The environment is overflowing The catalyst of love. In a space tailored for them by story creators, it is almost impossible for two beautiful and intelligent young people to meet without a love affair.
Summer has finally passed, winter is coming, how many days and nights, time will always ease all the pain. However, the brief calm that Elio obtained was overwhelmed by Oliver's phone call. The two casually exchanged information on each other on the phone, and when they learned that Oliver was about to get married, Elio seemed very calm. This was expected. After the greeting, they fell into silence, Elio stuck in the chair, muttering tones, and began calling Oliver far away on the other side of the earth with his name again and again. You remember at that time, in your arms, you told me, Call me by your name, and I will call you by mine ... At this moment, the teenager was defeated again. Hanging up the phone, Elio walked casually from this room to another room, the pretentious expression relaxed, the fire crackling, he walked over, squatted down, and tears began to flow down without listening. The camera is here to shoot his crying face all the way, and then the list of cast members appears. This picture is the last shot of the movie and the most sad picture. Forgetting you is the most difficult thing I have ever done, but you just use a phone call easily and let me give up my efforts.",9,3,5,6 May 2020
Mulholland Drive," Psychological personality analysis
","Prior statement: As a landmark and unique film in the history of suspense films, 'Muhran Dao' is almost as complex and deep as any previous work. It is also the most famous masterpiece of David Lynch. I have n't heard of anyone who can read this movie again. Most people (99%) are completely turned away by this movie. Many times, this film is also hidden by many people because of obscurity, and the audience is limited. However, the glory of the gods will not be covered after all. On the recommendation list of any suspense film, 'Muhland Road' will always be Is the most important part. So please watch the movie before watching the movie review, otherwise you will miss it and it will be a long time before such a movie appears next time. I hope that all officials will watch the movie and read it again, and if they feel that the writing is not bad, I hope they can give a few sentences of comments, which is also a bit of hard support.
Popularization of theory: The entire 'Muhran Dao' can be said to be a movie version of 'Analysis of Dreams' and other books, annotating Freund's theory with the movie's movies. If you are familiar with these theories or you are afraid of trouble, you can skip them first. I will mark the theories that I rely on to analyze the plots and let the officials compare and observe them. However, to understand 'Muhran Road', the following theoretical support is indispensable.
Freud believes:1. The spiritual level of human beings is divided into consciousness, preconsciousness and subconsciousness from shallow to deep. Some people's psychological activities can be perceived by themselves. As long as we focus our attention, we will find that there is a continuous flow of ideas, images or emotions in our hearts. This kind of psychological activity that can be realized by ourselves is called consciousness. However, some instinctive impulses, suppressed desires or vitality occur in an unconscious potential, because they do not conform to social morals and their own reason, they cannot enter the consciousness and are perceived by the individual, this latent undetectable thought , Mentality, desire and other psychological activities are called subconscious. It is the intermediary link between subconscious and consciousness. Memories about events and experiences that can be extracted with proper effort or attention. The human heart has an inspection function, that is, the human spirit will suppress those unreasonable memories and desires, let them stay in the subconscious, and make people no longer remember, so these are the things we most easily forget, For example, who we have humiliated, who cheated, who borrowed the money and did not pay back. However, the inspection function will be weakened. When the person is in a coma or sleep, the inspection function will be weakened, so those potential desires will come out and be mixed into consciousness to form a dream. Therefore, dreams are the fulfillment of wishes.
However, this mixing of potential desires must be disguised, otherwise the inspection function will still be found, so the dream scene is different from the real desires. And the more unwilling to be recognized by society or contrary to values, the more disguised and distorted.2. Personality is divided into three parts: the self, the self and the superego.3. The psychological defense mechanism is a defensive function of the self. In many cases, there are often contradictions and conflicts between the superego and the self and the self and the reality. At this time, people will feel pain and anxiety. At this time, the self can Unconsciously, in some way, adjust the relationship between a conflicting party, so that the superego's supervision can be accepted, and at the same time, the desire of the self can be satisfied in some form, thereby alleviating anxiety and eliminating pain. This is Self-defense mechanism.",10,1,2,15 April 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," Art should not be entangled by politics
","How could this film be moved around the world by one or two insults? Before you say that others are not, look at yourself first. Is there someone else's meticulous effort to make animation seriously? At present, domestic practitioners are either quick success or speculation, China 's original animation has not been well developed, similar to the classics such as 'Na Zao Nahai', 'Da Nao Tian Gong', 'Little Tadpole Finding Mom', 'Huluwa' Excellent animation works with rich Chinese cultural colors have long ceased to exist. Instead, they have been lost in the clumsy imitation of Europe, America, Japan and South Korea. There are too many 'folk politicians' who like to talk about ideal ambitions and national sentiments in China. Abuse and unreasonable anger have already become synonymous with some blind 'radical ethnic xenophobia'. In doing so, they again demonstrated slogans on the streets of Tokyo. Is the difference between the Japanese right wing?
Besides, it is certainly guilty to launch aggression in Japan, but the people are innocent. If those who have no reason to be angry were also born on that island country and grew up in that environment and received such education, I do n't believe they will not become like Japan. Like people. Just like these two lovely and pitiful characters, there are people who say this, say that they are 'ghosts', they really don't even have the minimum compassion of being human, how is it different from beasts?
Look at that box, both Jews and a group of German tourists visiting the Israel Jewish Holocaust Memorial Hall can have a good time. Why can't some people think peacefully? ! War is terrible, but the incomprehension between people is the biggest obstacle in the development of this world.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
The Imitation Game," Funny genius
","What kind of person is Alan Turing? He was born in public school and graduated from King 's College of Cambridge. He received the education of the elite intellectuals in the tradition of corruption. From one aspect, he has always been in a well-protected, as long as there are scientific research problems, he can be happy Live in the environment. Turing was shy and sensitive when he was young, and he was not good at expressing his feelings in words. After he opened it, he did not understand the human world and did not know how to use political means to achieve his goals. The Turing of Guan Fu presents such an image to people. He worked hard and could not understand the intention of his colleagues to order him to eat; he insisted on his deciphering method and hurriedly explained to the army leaders who came to inspect (this super cute paragraph). He did n't even know how to talk to his sister ...
But on the other hand, Alan Turing in reality, and the two skills of dumb and poisonous tongue ... he probably belongs to the kind of person who never understands the air and always speaks straight. Instead, it won him the love of his peers and juniors. When he was at Bletchley Manor, there was always a group of brains around him.
Contrary to the doubts and entanglements about homosexuality in the movie, Turing actually ... never concealed his orientation. When chatting, he simply came out with his colleagues when he found an opportunity. Of course, the techies did not agree with his orientation, but they finally accepted him.
Turing usually likes to wear pajamas with a sports jacket instead of a suit that highlights his body in the movie (Fortunately, the movie chose a suit and can lick and lick). On a formal occasion, he would wear ... a formal jacket.
Turing likes to ride bicycles and long-distance running, and almost represents the United Kingdom in the Olympic Games. Therefore, Juan Fu will run around in the movie. The reason why he likes long-distance running is to relieve the pressure (serious face) that no one asked him.
Turing also has a somewhat cute attribute of pollen allergy, so that people around him are not surprised that he wears a gas mask to work. Saying that I really look forward to Juan Fu's tears and allergies, or a gas mask face! It is a pity that this stalk is not used in the movie. Only in the last question and answer from Turing with the detective did the line 'I am allergic to pollen'.
Turing can also drink a pint of beer in one go. Seeing here, did you think of Professor X in the first love of Cha Nan! That's right. At first, my brain supplement to Turing was like him!
Turing is still a big hand writing little yellow text, which is true. When he was investigated by the police because of his gay identity, the police asked him to write a statement. He ... wrote five pages of paper with beautiful words and fluent sentences, describing the relationship between him and his lover in detail and vividly. The police I was shocked. I didn't expect this person to be so straightforward.
Having said so much, if I want to evaluate this movie objectively, I can only say that it only depicts a short period of Turing's undulating life; it also shows only one aspect of Turing's personality. It will allow more people who have not even heard the name 'Turing' to understand this great scientist, knowing that it is his job that ended World War II for several years in advance. On the other hand, Turing's other scientific achievements, the bold and forthright aspect of his character, and his bloody love life can only be found in the original biography. So everyone is going to read the biography! It's really burning and rotten!",9,0,0,16 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Violent aesthetics
","A simple revenge film, but because of the director 's ghost talent, he rejoiced all the bloody shots-he carefully processed all the bloody shots of the church into black and white, and the blood gave the lens a heavy shadow, which also represented the moment in The vagueness and pain in Uma's memory. This is a flexible extreme. At the other end, Uma 's Revenge Journey, especially in the first half of his trip to Japan, Xiao Kun treated the dead as a toy-either by Liu Yulian 's head being cut off and carried in his hand, or the water column was like a champagne bottle. The blood spurting was either Liu Yunlian 's 88 death-bearing team members who were cut off by Uma 's solitary arm and thigh on the battlefield. The first beautiful snow drifting, quietly unable to hear a whimper, Liu Yulian in white clothes and white socks standing on the snow, pure as a fairy, but unfortunately less than ten minutes, the top of the fairy's head was cut off by a third. The wriggling brain, because she was involved in the church blood bath, owed Uma's life. You say this is a violent aesthetic? Or is it aesthetic violence? However, you will never feel sick, pleasure and pleasure from head to toe like McDonald's big frozen Coke in the summer, you will not feel happy for Uma because these people who died under her knife are worth her. Such a violent death.
Come out and mix, always be mixed.
By the way, Liu Yulian performed really well, and the animation that explained her life experience was also good. The ghost of Xiao Kun lies in what he learns like, playing small animations in Japan, and white eyebrows in China, and the aura is very good.One of the scenes that made people feel guilty was the big ending shot from the top. The size of the boss is dead or disabled. Uma's daughter sits on the bed to watch cartoons. Uma lies on the bathroom tiles and hugs a hair The plush toy burst into tears. It wasn't a fluke in death, not the excitement after reaching the ultimate goal, or the hatred that was once there, but love, killing Bill, who was once in love, with your own hands.
Because she has this power. Also because she has no other choice. Hate is born of love.
A woman's own small universe is so powerful that she even prepares her own guardian angel. If you are on her small list of love, please cherish it; if you were once on her small list of love, please be careful.
She does not necessarily need to kill you personally, because the most beautiful revenge is bloodless, the most beautiful revenge is not to kill, it is to forget.
If time is her weapon.
If time is a weapon, please let us forget the sea.
The weird thing is that the actor who played Bill died of 'suicide' in the United States 2 months ago. We can only believe that Uma did not kill him.",9,0,0,27 April 2020

Pride & Prejudice," Long dress flutters, the breeze is blowing
","Excellence is ability, it is courage to dare to be excellent, it is luck to meet people who can appreciate you, and it is the same for women in ancient and modern China.

But it is not necessary to hold a hate for Zhang Ailing because it is also a kind of luck to meet others, although it cannot be compared with Sister Lin. Ai Ling must know that the common people have their own Qing Jiayun Road, and they must not imitate a fairyland.

Once Upon a Time in America," Once a street teenager
","Years later, the desperate noodles returned to New York. In the bar of an old friend, loyal and foolish, he slowly asked him: 'How have you lived in these 35 years?' Quietly answered: 'I just go to bed every morning.' It's hard to say a word, full of vicissitudes. His temples were covered with white hair. He was no longer a gangster on the street, and he was no longer a gangster in the sky. He was just a calm, stumbling old man. He had nothing but memories ...His life was about several brothers who were born and died, and a beautiful girl; about friendship and dreams, about youth and love, and about loyalty and betrayal. In those years, when a person was silently displaced and traveled far away, what was he holding in his heart? Is it the betrayal of the ringing phone reminder after years? Is it a girl who is ignorant of the angelic dance peeping through the teenager's doorway?
Years later, he finally realized that he had been guilty for 35 years, which was originally pure loyalty and friendship; the brother he devoted to and maintained for life had deceived him for 35 years.There is nothing new under the sun, and the key to good movies lies in the way they tell stories. The yellowish color of the film seems to be covered with a layer of mist, so that each lens is like an old yellowed picture; the high and distant pan flute is awkward. The music and the plot blended together to complement each other, and several transitions were made to happen. In the four-hour movie, the plot is clear when you see the second pass.

La La Land," Colorful dreams
","The title 'La La Land' is wonderful. This word is a common word in English. Webster's dictionary define 'La La Land' as the following: 'an euphoric dreamlike mental state detached from the harsher realities of life', that is, a blissful mental state that is general in dreams and free from cruel reality. In my opinion, this seemingly cute and unintentional word describes the story in the film very accurately and concisely, and also summarizes a message that the film wants to convey to the audience. In addition, La La Land is also an alias for LA Los Angeles where the story of the film is located. Los Angeles, the city of stars, countless young people come to Hollywood to find their dreams, and the dreams of countless people are shattered here. However, there are always people looking for dreams, and some people are young. The starlight in this city will never be dim, and it seems that it will always be so beautiful.

Up," Fairy tale fantasy world
","I always thought that one of the most important processes of growing up is to accept the disappointing reality: the political system is not perfect, the economic system is unreasonable, and the pets and people who will never learn the convenience of the yard and the ghosts and minds, and of course they are not born enough I am not smart enough to be handsome. From this perspective, Pixar is an outright fairytale factory. Whether it's the naive ideal of its movie content or its reputation that hasn't faded for more than ten years, the little table lamp that is bouncing around is probably the farthest away from the words disappointment these years. Everyone has a story in the cinema that is better to die than regretting wasting time and money. Of course, Pixar's movies will never be the protagonist of such stories.I like the opening episodes of Carl and Ellie's life. From two Xiaowu guessing to each other, no matter how childless and heirless, the companionship that has never been abandoned has been the most beautiful fairy tale in life. The older you are, the less you are not your own, but live for the people who care about you and the people you care about. Guarding the memory of the house and the lover for the rest of his life, this is his biggest wish, turning up the wish of the dead wife, I think Carl is full of guilt, I just want to do more for her, do it earlier. But when it seemed that even the last house full of memories would be taken away, Carl fled. That 's right, he was to fulfill his lover 's last wish, but more importantly, he could n't imagine life that he could n't even live in his memories, so he took all his memories-the house, and fled to the beginning of the memories. An old man like Martin Crane, locked himself in the memory of the most beloved, refused to face the reality, unwilling to face his life, and gambled on the rest of his life in the most romantic and crazy way. This is love and perseverance, but also despair and paranoia.Memories of loved ones are the most precious, but when the memories confine the soul and make people unwilling to love others anymore, it becomes a stubborn illness. Russel, Kevin, and Dug were all in the eyes of Carl at first. It was just a trouble that hindered him and his memory. He only cared about his house and moved it to the waterfall. Everything else it's none of my concern. But they three All are objects that need to be cared for: a child eager for his father's love, a big bird chased and killed by a 'bad guy', and a dog looking for his owner. In the end, the whole movie is not about the story of a romantic messy old man flying across the sea in a hot air balloon made of a house to realize the wish of his dead wife, but how a sad old man can regain the fulcrum of life and the object of love . Finally, as the house fell into the waterfall and Carl's loneliness and self-blame, he would never forget Ellie, but he would not use remembrance to numb himself, because he was going to accompany a little boy to count the cars on the road.
In the worst words, this is a story of salvation.Perseverance, trust, hope and love are the eternal themes in Pixar movies. They are not to tell people how great these ideas are, but to let the audience re-understand these excessive abuses and even distortions along with the protagonists 'experiences. The humanity that controls our lives all the time. This sincerity will not disappoint.",10,0,0,12 May 2020

I remembered the distress signal sent by the captain when the Titanic was killed. The fireworks also rose to the vast starry sky, bloomed, and landed on the infinite sea. And the naive little girl on the boat smiled happily because she saw the beautiful fireworks. I still feel heartache when I think of it. People's feelings will always get deeper and deeper with age.

","On the surface, the story of Water Shape Story is a pretty clichÃ© love story.

However, this movie still can bring the audience an extraordinary and moving feeling, which is inseparable from the director's ingenious ideas, which is precisely what this movie hides from its cleverness.Paul Ostbury, who once served as the art director of 'Twilight: Lunar Eclipse' and other films, in this collaboration with Toro, designed a set of very unified images for 'The Story of Water' The scene, whether it is a cold and humid research base, or a dark and messy attic room, creates a dark and colorful visual atmosphere for the audience.Of course, the excellence of 'The Story of Water' is not limited to the unique aesthetic characteristics and picture texture of the film.

At that time, I was 13 years old and I was in the second grade.Then, with anticipation, watched the arrival of the Goblet of Fire, the Half-Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows. It has to be said that the further the story is, the more the plot is no longer suitable for children, and some fall into the stereotypes, but with the growth of Little Harry, our original readers are also growing.When Harry Potter turned into a real image for the first time on the big screen, I still remember seeing Harry 's excitement when chasing the golden thief on a broomstick, like a long-awaited wish turned into reality.In fact, overall, the Magic Stone should be the best in the entire Harry Potter movie series. Regardless of the plot, the original book alone is the thinnest in the entire series, and from the perspective of the length of the movies in the subsequent films, the time of the first part is relatively ample.It's just that as the book gets thicker and more filled with violence and blood, death and parting, the blockbuster black covers Hogwarts and the screen, too.

Let him just sit there, a corner of that dark room, as if in the center of the black hole of the universe. People respect him, love him, and fear him. He is so complicated and so deep.

Therefore, he can casually interact with high-level political figures, from the lowest level to the highest level of society, he can also weave a large and intangible net.
