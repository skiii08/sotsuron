Angels & Demons," What a Shame!
","Potentially I think if the film was set out and directed as the book portrays, this film could have been one of the best and most exciting films ever made. Unfortunately the film looks as if the directors and producers bought the cliff notes from the library and made the film on that. To be honest i am actually half way through the book and managed to get hold of a copy of the film and gave in to watching it. Luckily I stopped watching the film after 15mins so I still don't know how the story ends and will carry on reading the book. Within 5 minutes of the film I had got as far as I am in the book.When you read a book you can imagine exactly how it would look like if it were made into a film but within the first 5 minutes every perception I had was completely changed. The first part of the book is extremely important when Langdon goes to CERN meeting Kohler and Ms Vetra being none the wiser about her father. IT SETS THE SCENE!! and they have missed all off it. I would love to see a remake of the film but I'm sure its very unlikely. I would be happy if they completely re-made the character Robert Langdon with an unknown actor and started again from scratch because, although I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code (film), for the sheer brilliance of the book I think someone could have done a lot better with it and potentially made one of the most interesting and exciting set of films within recent years. Dan Brown should feel hard done here (although I'm sure he's isn't short of a few quid after the book release), if the film had the right directors behind it and followed the book more thoroughly, Dan Brown would be sitting on a gold mine.",1,4,8,23 June 2009
