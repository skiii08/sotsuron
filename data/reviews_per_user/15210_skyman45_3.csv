Requiem for a Dream," Aronofsky's brilliant depiction of spiraling drug addiction
","There has been lots of buzz about this movie over the last few months, and I dismissed it all until I actually saw the film. Pure genius. We start with the characters which are real and easy to relate with, and move with them as they struggle to cope with their everyday lives, dreams, and addictions. We bond with them, and feel their pain as the go deeper and deeper into the abyss of drug abuse. Absolute brilliance. Dismiss everything you hear about this movie, and see it for yourself.",10,1,2,23 June 2001
Ocean's Eleven," The most entertaining movie this year.
","From the beginning this movie grabs your attention, and holds it through out the movie. Soderbergh does an excellent job of utilizing this huge cast. Andy Garcia's performance sticks out the most of the bunch. Truly outstanding. The only problem I had was with the decision to cast Julia Roberts. She's looking more and more fake, and honestly, see this movie and tell me her lips haven't been injected with marshmallows. All in all, a good, clever movie for this holiday season. 9/10 ( I swear to you, look at her lips! You'll regret not bringing 3D glasses!)",9,0,0,8 December 2001
The Mummy Returns," Horrible, mindless, garbage.
","I had high expectations for this movie since I thoroughly enjoyed the first one, but now after seeing it, I can honestly say I would like my money back. We have all the original actors starring in the same roles. Not to mention the addition of the 'bart simpson' like Alex character, son of Rick and Evie. He was a pointless addition, as it's obvious he's just there for brief (and un-funny) comic relief. John Hannah revises his role of 'Jonathan Carnahan, and is painfully annoying in this picture. He was much more entertaining in the first movie, and is disgraced even more in this. Aside from the flat and boring characters, we have the love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun, which is a disgrace to to any love story ever written. They have no chemistry, and the audience does not feel anything for them. If you are going for the graphics, you will be sorely disappointed.The graphics in this movie look like they were cut and pasted from a nintendo game. If you are a fan of the first movie, and have any respect for it, do not see this movie, as you will lose all love and respect for the series.",1,2,4,23 June 2001
