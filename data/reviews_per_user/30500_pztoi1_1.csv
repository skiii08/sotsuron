Source Code," Riddled with inconsistencies
","I like sci-fi, but it has to make sense in its own 'made-up reality' way. Take the Matrix: brilliant because every single twist and turn was neatly tied in, no loose ends, no plot lines that seem to defy the general direction the film is going in. But this, Sourcecode? You don't know if you're coming or going. The film is all over the place, broken chain of causation, contradictory events with no explanation, bits coming out of left field with no prior build up: messy, messy, messy .In other respects, the film is reminiscent of a dreamy ground hog day experience with lots of thrills and knuckle-biting action thrown in. What it could have done without though, was the hurried romance thread which seems to have been added as an afterthought.",Null,1,5,19 August 2011
