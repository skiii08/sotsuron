Source Code," Poor authenticity
","Very vivid and a good story and acting. But the train is not an Amtrak nor (goes into Union Sta) nor is it a Metra commuter (goes into Ogilvee Sta). Nor is there a Glenbrook, IL anywhere on my map. Glenbrook Park is about 10 miles West of O'Hare Airport but it is only a park with a pond, not a suburb. Writer/director should have done a little homework by consulting with ANYONE in Chicago about the train or just gone online and checked with Metra. The scene northbound from the south is real and most of the rest appears to be as well, so if they shot on site, I would have expected them to choose real cities and proper trains.",Null,0,2,2 October 2011
