It," Great horror film
","A very good horror film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with the relentless Pennywise creeping into every scene that seems to be developing the other aspects of a story (eg. character's backgrounds, love subplots, etc.). Suffers from typical dumb-horror-movie-character syndrome, where the characters always run towards danger instead of calling for help. Bill Skarsg√•rd's performance as Pennywise is truly brilliant and makes you nervous at any point. The colours are glorious, and the quips from the kids are funny enough to make me chuckle and facepalm. While I don't enjoy horror movies, because I don't enjoy torturing myself, I cannot deny that this movie is a masterpiece.",8,0,0,4 February 2020
Casablanca," A classic
","(exerpt from my Key Largo commentary) 'Mr. Humphrey Bogart, to me, plays a very slight iteration of the same character archetype in every single movie (always tinged with nostalgia and regret, a mysterious man who the audience never understands until the end, etc), just like his role in Casablanca. That being said, he does it very well, and it is still endearing to watch (although these movies have to be spaced out by other movies otherwise it really does become soul-sucking.' The movie touches on interesting themes of the War of the time, in a very interesting location whose angle on the war many people couldn't understand or realise at the time.",8,0,0,4 February 2020
Citizen Kane," Solid film; definitely aged strangely
","An interesting landmark in cinema history which is a romanticized version of (I quote from my Google Search): 'American newspaper magnates William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, and aspects of the screenwriters' own lives.'
Fantastic cinematography, definitely Orson Welles' magnum opus, as I can't recognise most of his other movies at all (at the time of writing).",7,0,0,4 February 2020
Coraline," Probably Laika's best piece of work, ever.
","A charming take on the book (which I admittedly have not read), feeling like a Tim Burton movie at all times. Charming worlds, beautiful color palette as always, music is fantastic, characters are mysterious, weird, intriguing, twisted, fun.",10,1,1,4 February 2020
The Irishman," Noice
","Really, really long. Like, 3h30 long. Pretty complex: There's a lot of characters, and it's not always clear what's going on where. This seriously bothered my friend Dan who watched it with me, but for me, the main character, the Irishman (played by Robert De Niro), is pretty easy to follow throughout. I enjoyed the film for all the usual reasons, but I must admit it's nice to see Joe Pesci in roles aside from Home Alone. Update: my buddy thought the cinematography was awful, so that's interesting.Some of the 'usual reasons' that I didn't specify previously:
-cinematography
-performances
-script/story progression
-p editing and pacing (for a 3h30 movie, it was bound to get a little hectic, so overall I'm glad it's not worse.I wonder if the CGI young R. De Niro only bothered me because I was told about it, and so I was incredibly fixated on scrutinising it. In any case, objectively, it was well done.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The best CW movie out there :)
",Really fun and funny movie making its fair share of commentary about the Cold War. Definitely worth the watch for just about anyone who knows anything about the CW.,10,1,1,4 February 2020
Battleship Potemkin," Very interesting, perhaps not entertaining.
","I understand its cultural impact (Odessa Steps scene), criticising the Tsarist authority as an extended criticism of what they then. Beyond that, I don't have much to say about this movie, it didn't strike me as particularly impressive outside of its historical context. One could argue that's the entire thing going for this movie, but quite frankly, I don't really care. I'm here to watch movies and crosscheck with their historical context, I'm not studying how cinema is used as a vector to criticise, compliment, or otherwise comment on events in their time, or the past.",8,1,2,4 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Big yikes.
","The final piece in a trainwreck of a trilogy, doomed to fail by corporate greed rushing these films out with no planned story at all, and it shows.
This film feels like it's missing JJ Abrams' 8th film.
The villain is rushed, elements of TLJ are either swept under the rug or very quickly resolved.
I'm not saying that TLJ was without flaws, because it's got pleeeenty of those. That being said, at least it had a direction. Had this film embraced that direction, I think we could've had a 6 or a 7 out of 10 rather than a 3. Everything is confused, and rushed, and the fact that the story is so awful means I can't appreciate really cool things like Adam Driver's acting, the VFX, cool new mechanics like the force co-op play between the two.(Also, apparently this movie was changed to appeal to the chinese markets, where it tanked as well. Of course this movie did well, money wise, but it coud've done so much better, and also, the minions made a bunch of cash, doesn't mean I want it to exist.)The music is unmemorable and generic 'epic movie soundtrack' kinda thing; the film relies far too heavily on nostalgia cameos like shots of heroin. The whole force thing is pushed beyond the limits of OP, and it's not really very fun.I was hoping for so much more from this franchise. I hope Disney and Lucasfilm learn their lesson for when they inevitably reboot for another mainline trilogy. And it had better slap. Or they're in for it.
At least the mandalorian and the other shows are good.",3,11,17,4 February 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," One of the best superhero movies of all time
","As the title says, it's also one of the best animations out there.
This film is overflowing personality, from the characters, to their visual designs, their aimations, their voices; the way the music ties into it (leitmotifs woooo; thematically relevant music), the settings, the animation style and techniques, the EVERYTHING.I love this movie.",10,0,1,4 February 2020
Face_Off," Fun action movie :)
","Interesting movie concept, really well done for its time. Also one of the only Travolta performances I've seen other than Grease (1978), and he was hecca young there. Overall a thoroughly entertaining action movie.",8,0,1,4 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Woah.
","A 3H BEHEMOTH of a finale to a truly unique phenomenon in cinema: a legacy, a build-up, even, of 21 movies over 11 years into this moment. While the movie does reward knowing all the characters, only the main bunch have to be known, and it's obviously best if you've seen Infinity War, since it is the ending of that movie that directly leads into this one, like one big two-parter movie. Heck, it was even shot back-to-back. The two movies combined stand just shy of 5h45', which is an insane time.
At the time of writing, there are a total of 23 movies, with close to a dozen announced for the near future. The 23 movies, up to SM: Far From Home would take over 41 hours to watch!
Back the Endgame. It is a heart-wrenching movie, as the characters we have grown to love reach the end of their arcs, and sometimes lives; jam-packed with action and humour (except for the cringy Fortnite reference. Damn you MarvelxEpicGames!! Also Hulk dab was cringy but it was also funny, and kinda made sense? But the fortnite thing really taints the movie. Even if Thor swearing at some internet lowlife is funny, and shows just how low he has gone, from fighting literal Gods to... Noobmaster69. Fat Thor was hilarious, as well as being a nice body message ('I'm still worthy!'), although it is my headcanon that the end fight would have been much easier had Thor been his good old buff self. Sure, beer belly is fine, and those who matter will love you for it, but it still doesn't beat abs my dude.
[EDIT: I've thought about it for a while, and also heard other people's opinions, who take it much harsher than I do, but fat Thor was funny and all... But I sincerely hope they revert back to buff Thor again, because it's just better].
It takes an interesting take on time travel, which is a scary topic in a lot of movies, and handles it surprisingly really well! That being said, the movie feels very geared towards us young'uns who grew up watching the movies. My dad, an avid cinema watcher, who does enjoy a lot of the movies in the MCU (although he didn't enjoy GotG, so take that as you will, to understand his different tastes), would probably have some trouble keeping up as everything happens very quickly. That being said, I love how the movie slows down for nobody, the music is another masterpiece in the series, thank you Alan Silvestri (note to Danny Elfman for doing Age of Ultron's music). The cinematography is stunning, the special effects are nothing short of otherworldly, and Captain Marvel has less screen time than Black Widow's PB sandwich, so that's nice (because seriously, that woman is nasty off camera, and a lame addition on camera. I hate superman for the same reasons. Too strong, always the same cryptonite bs. It's a deus ex machina. They made her so powerful she just has to be 'absent', 'saving other planets' because Thanos surely isn't a big enough priority. Big Lame.).
Of course, it's also notably the first movie to ever overtake J. Cameron's Avatar, (the one which nobody really remembers cause it was so darn generic), and therefore taking the number one highest grossing film (of course, not adjusted for inflation, or Disney's hard push for this including a rerelease with 'extra footage'). Back on topic, while definitely one of the most emotionally charged movies in cinema as far as I'm concerned, it does have a very long legacy to build this up. Consequently, it's hard for me to determine this movie's standalone value. Is it fair to exclude it from its context? I think at least a link to IW needs to be made, since they're two parts of the same movie, really. In any case, the crown jewel in Marvel's crown.",10,3,10,4 February 2020
Toy Story 4," A fantastic end to an iconic franchise :)
","A masterpiece that closes this beloved franchise so fully that I could never ask for another one. So many things to say, but the biggest ones are the following: Heart-wrenching and also funny and exciting; beautiful to watch, listen to, and experience; and the villain is amazing. Picking up on that last one, the hero, and story, can only be as good as the villain (because otherwise there's no tension and the hero has nothing to surpass), and Gabby Gabby is nuanced, in such an interesting way (I understand her motives but I still don't agree with her, it's perfect). Woody is really the main focus of this movie, as it's always been, *reaaally*, and his character arc is completed here. The whole girl power thing was definitely present but not super pushed, so that was cool.",9,3,5,4 February 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Awesome :)))
","A movie with a seemingly slow start, but everything amounts into an epic ending that on its own justifies this film as truly masterful.
The visuals (cinematography, production design, costumes) and acting throughout were insanely fun and enchanting.The only thing keeping this film from a ten for me is the inclusion of Margot Robbie's character: I love the actress, but I found her character added nothing to the story and could've shaved off a good 10 minutes of runtime, but I guess QT would've lost some premium FOOTage there.",9,1,5,5 March 2020
Get Out," Nearly perfect
","A brilliant movie in many ways, performances, script, production design, cinematography.I do not, however, agree with its 'racial' critiques which do not carry over to countries outside of the USA. None of my friends understood these critiques of corrupt and racist police forces, it just felt like another element of the story in an american landscape.To reiterate: not a good social commentary, but a brilliant",9,0,3,4 February 2020
Moulin Rouge!," Uhhhhhhh
","This movie is profoundly confusing. I have no cue how to feel about it. It's definitely a unique experience. But I don't know if I liked it, or not. It's such a whirlwind.Very interesting.",7,0,0,4 February 2020
1917," Pretty darn epic
","Interesting concept of shooting in as few takes as possible, and definitely a technological feat, that works pretty well and contributes to the immersion. That being said, there were certain points where I feel the film could've used some cuts (those sharp turns in the trenches were fuggen' rough, bro.)I'm thoroughly impressed at the insane scale of the set they built, and therefore the fact that we never see a location twice.The character pulls some real BS 'i'm the protagonist, so I live', which irked me a little bit. But alas, twas still solid!the acting was excellent, definitely helped move me while watching it.Music was somewhat overbearing at times, but otherwise did the job.Spicy film. Worth watching.",8,5,8,4 February 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," A masterpiece.
","I'd give this movie five stars for being one of the most iconic movies of all time, but I can't fw the last 15 minutes of the movie, which even the director doesn't have an idea for (as he admitted in an interview), so it's just random psychedelic nonsense in an otherwise brilliantly crafted masterpiece.",9,2,3,4 February 2020
How to Train Your Dragon," Top 3 best movies of all time!
","This movie is incredible for a plethora of reasons.
Themes.
Cinemtography and lighting (Roger Deakins uwu).
Voice acting (Jay Baruchell, most notably).
Animation, especially for its time (and even now).
Simple yet powerful story. Structure, as in the clear links from one part of the story to the next, often with almost exactly the same phrases (eg. 'Why didn't you {kill}' or 'I did this').
The music score by John Powell.
I could write a full essay analysis about this movie and explain in depth why I think it's so amazing. It's the closest I've ever seen a feature film get to perfect.",10,1,1,4 February 2020
The Shape of Water," Maybe not film of the year, but still great
","Interesting blend of fiction and drama. I liked the diversity which was almost always nicely fitted in and/or added something (if not at the very least not actively ruining the movie, except for that gay scene. Added nothing to the whole movie, wasted a good 5 minutes, other than saying 'aw shucks the 60s sure were racist and homophobic' which is not the plot of this movie). Main villain was interesting, despite being a wholly hateable character (not like Thanos~~).Very good film, but definitely not what I would've called film of the year.",8,0,3,4 February 2020
Whiplash," Whiplash: A jazzy masterpiece
","An absolutely incredible movie about a jazz drummer determined to become one of the greats. While not accurately representing how jazz musicians train (nobody goes until their hand bleeds, that is counter-productive, in fact, but as said by Adam Neely, real practice is really boring and hard to romanticize (e.g. practicing scales for 5 hours, like Adam Neely did). I refer to (can you guess who?) Adam Neely's video on this movie, as I found it to be much more educated than any of my thoughts could've been. Cinematographically, the movie is absolutely incredible (lots of depth of field and interesting camera angles), and the color palettes are fantastic. The main character is difficult to only root for or hate for: he's quite nuanced, and can be a dick, and makes decisions most people would never agree with (dumping his girl because he needs more time), but we also understand his desire, and we respect his determination and drive to become one of legend. J.K Simmons' performance as the abusive teacher that pushes for greatness and perfection, nothing less, is one of the most powerful in cinema history and one of my favorites. That and Spiderman hunting, eh?",10,0,0,4 February 2020
Finding Dory," Great movie.
","I love this film.
It's visually stunning, with PIxar pushing the limits of animation continuously.
It's incredibly wholesome. Dory is just so darn vibin'. This kind of easy-to-digest family finding story is just nice. Sometimes simple works. I don't think this movie is a movie that enters the great halls of fame of cinema history, but sometimes a movie just needs to be fun.And by golly, this movie was.",8,2,3,4 February 2020
Rango," One of my favorite movies of all time
","A wholly amazing masterpiece, combining animation and western styles.In the modern word of animation where everything is all cutesy and fluffy, Rango embraces its gritty and asymetrical characters, places, and atmosphere. This makes for an etremely engaging cast and scenes.The music is really fun, and is even humouristically diagetic when it needs to.The themes of Identity and redemption resonate greatly throughout this movie (and mak a lot of sense coming from a pathological liar of a chameleon).Admittedly, the glorious animation and large worldbuilding is probably because J. Depp was busy shooting PoTC4 (first one not directed by Gore Verbinsky), so y'know, probably one of the last super indepth worlds we get, since movies like Minions has like 18M budget, and then makes over a billion goddamned dollars. Hate that movie, and I hate 8 year olds.",10,1,1,4 February 2020
Rear Window," A great Hitckcock :)
",Interesting movie with Grace Kelly and James Stewart. Love the fact that we always see everything from the apartment. It really feels like we're trapped with the character in his wheelchair.,9,1,1,4 February 2020

The Wizard of Oz," A brilliant reminder of '39
","An interesting classic, which ends up being a dream at the end (a twist that I had not remembered. The classic flip from 'B&W' (although it isn't, really), to color is fantastic. A beautiful, cult classic, film, that takes from the book that was already ingrained in US culture. The songs are fun, the character designs all represent a different thing, it's extremely kid friendly. The sets are gorgeous and make for this vast and mythical world. Very entertaining. Note: MGM's response to Disney's hit animation Pinocchio.",10,0,0,4 February 2020
