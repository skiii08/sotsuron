Kill Bill: Vol. 2," So far, so good ...with a question about a scene.
","I was enjoying the movie up until the scene with the Bride and the old Chinese guy. So far, I've only watched about half an hour of the film. I stopped watching it when I saw that there were no English subtitles during the conversation between the Bride and the old Chinese guy who was going to teach her something or other. They seemed to be having pretty long talks together and I was annoyed because I had no idea of what they were saying!Is this scene supposed to be that way?? ...or is my DVD missing something?? Please respond to me directly since I may not know how to find your answer on the Board (I'm a newbie ...blush, blush). I enjoyed the first film, Kill Bill Vol.I, very much and was enjoying Vol.2 until this scene with the old Chinese gent.",Null,0,1,28 September 2004
