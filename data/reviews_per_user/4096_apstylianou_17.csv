Skyfall," As a huge 007 fan, and awaiting Spectre this year, I highly disagree with all the negativity on this site about this film
","Skyfall is the perfect original Bond movie. Although I haven't seen exactly every 007 movie, but I am still a huge fan of Bond, I love spy movies and Daniel Craig is my favorite James Bond actor; he has a history, he has a mysterious past and the calm demeanor that the character should possess better than any other Bond actor I've seen.Firstly, I have to disagree with all the negative reviews that I found on IMDb about this film to my surprise (although I respect other opinions even if I don't fall for them). Skyfall is at the top of the spy genre with the thrills, action, stunts and the performances. Daniel Craig is still the sh*t, Judi Dench was absolutely fantastic as M, she was in fact my favorite performance in the film followed by Javier Bardem as Silva, who was my favorite 007 villain ever. I feel like I could make the argument that Silva is just definitely up there with Auric Goldfinger and Ernst Stavro Blofeld.He was 2012's Heath Ledger's Joker. He is unpredictable, has good humour to add up to his intimidating presence and like the Joker, he makes the stakes high for the film and its plot and story. The action is out of the water, the scene where they are on motorbikes chasing each other on the rooftops was my favorite action sequence of the film. All from that scene to the end with its climax with the helicopter at Bond's old house.Now about the plot, the plot is very dynamic above most spy movies, this one is far from the clichéd spy film, the story is a great story about resurrection, survival and skill. The villain's story is one that actually has a history that is told to explain his motivations and evilness. Javier Bardem had the chemistry for that kind of character reflecting back on his Oscar-winning performance in 2007's No Country for Old Men. Bond still had a story about, we might not have gotten more of his history as we will in Spectre this year, but he still is the greatness that Bond is made of and it is still great seeing him deliver wit and humour with his one-liners and watching him kick ass like Batman is just great.Oh, and the song, Skyfall by Adele is just incredible. Adele has an incredible voice and her performance and her song tops any other Bond song I've heard.Overall, being a huge 007 fan and as I am highly excited for this October's most anticipated movie: Spectre, I loved Skyfall; it is my favorite spy movie of all time and while I think Spectre will be great, but I just don't know if it will be as great as Skyfall. Skyfall is my favorite 007 film and it has to be one of my favorite movies of all time, if I had to make that list, Skyfall has to be on there.10/10",10,4,9,1 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The perfect finale to a classic trilogy
","Return of the Jedi is the completion of the original storyline of the classic adventure. It's the balance between good and evil finally resolved. It's a horribly underrated movie, which is unforgivable, in my opinion.I don't understand everyone's problem with the ewoks. While I can say that they probably weren't the best things in the world, I still have no problem with them, but hey, it's all a matter of opinions.Star Wars is the franchise that I fell in love with a long time ago and Return of the Jedi excellently concluded the original trilogy in spectacular fashion.",9,0,1,7 December 2015
The Revenant," Another masterpiece following Innaritu's successful Birdman picture
","I loved 2014's Birdman and I am a fan of Alejandro G. Innaritu. But if Birdman to me, was a masterpiece that followed the human condition of the sanity between three characters, Innaritu once again delivers that accomplishment that worked for Birdman and that works for three great characters with this survival tale that is The Revenant.Leonardo DiCaprio kills it in his role of Hugh Glass. He doesn't have a lot of lines in the film, but whenever he is on screen, he delivered. I was wondering, well a survival role, can he pull it off, and it turns out to my surprise, he succeeded. I recognized Leonardo as the character he was playing and not as himself in that role, and that's why I think that this time, he should get his long overdue Academy Award.The rest of the cast were great too, Tom Hardy, Will Poulter, Domhnall Gleeson all of them delivered. The Revenant was gritty, realistic, very manly and beautifully powerful with pulse pounding tension and a score that is haunting and dazzling.10/10",10,2,10,5 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg's big return to the big screen!
","I'm a huge Steven Spielberg fan and it's been a long time since he's done a great movie, and this year, he definitely delivered with Bridge of Spies. A moving, inspiring masterpiece based on the Cold War where Tom Hanks delivers with a charming, well-performed performance that is sure to get him another look from the Oscars come the 88th Academy Awards. Tom Hanks plays a lawyer who is hired to defend a man accused of being a Soviet spy.I loved the way Tom Hanks portrays this guy who has been hired to defend this person who everyone assumes is a bad person and wish him hanged, but Tom Hanks makes it his job to ensure the he is not what they say he is and he stops at nothing in this movie to ensure that he is given a fair chance and tries to send the man accused of being a spy home.This movie has a lot of heart to it as well as a lot of humour too. The development of the characters is executed very well, by the end of this movie, you are just thoroughly entertained. And I kid you not, you will come out of this movie going 'Wow, that's the Steven Spielberg we all know and love'.I really enjoyed this movie, it was well-acted, well directed and it washed that horrible taste of Howl out of my mouth. I would highly recommend this movie to you if you are looking for something interesting and great this year before Star Wars and Mockingjay Part 2.9.4/10",10,0,2,2 November 2015
Jurassic World," Another great great summer blockbuster that's pure popcorn enjoyment
","I finally got a chance to see Jurassic World and I feel like the last man on Earth to watch this movie. This movie had a few plot conveniences that come whenever the director decides they should be added in and the side characters were quite underdeveloped and I take down a star for that alone. Nevertheless, this movie had everything I wanted in a action summer blockbuster movie, tension, excitement, laughter and enjoyment, and I loved it.Chris Pratt stole the show, to me, he was one of my favourite performances of the year, Bryce Dallas Howard was great too. She was a fantastic female lead in a movie. We've had so many female leads in movies this year. We've had Emilia Clarke in Terminator: Genisys, Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road, Elizabeth Olsen and Scarlett Johanson in Avengers: Age of Ultron and so many more.The side characters were a great support in the film. The Indominus Rex is by far one of the most scariest antagonists ever in movie history. What makes the Indominus Rex so scary is that you can't predict it's every move and its a highly intelligent animal that breaks free of human control and decides to kill everything in sight that it sees. Seems a bit familiar with Ultron, don't you think? No strings attached to the I- Rex either, it seems.I will say, not every movie is without a flaw, and so here are some things in the movie that made me give it a bit of a thumbs down (and I don't like being a negative nazi, but I can't help but point it out at times.I thought that the side characters, I'm talking about the two boys, Gray and his older brother, Zach. I mean, they are good supporting characters but I kinda forgot about them halfway through the movie, and they were a big part of the film and it's story, but I felt like they were very underdeveloped and not once did I fear for their lives because of that. I mean, I wanted to, but I just didn't.I also felt like there were a few plot twists in the movie that were too convenient for me to be surprised by.SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW SO BE AWARELike for instance, the Indominus Rex is suddenly half-raptor.Dinos can suddenly communicate to each other.The lab is cooking up other dinosaurs that are highly intelligent.Hoskins decides to become the bad guy for no apparent reason and he too was so underdeveloped.Even these plot twists arrive without any proper development. Its like a deus ex-machina that comes out of nowhere at the last second and there's no set-up to any of it. It just comes when the director declares it should come.Still, despite all that, I loved this movie, it was a great cinema experience for me, I had a really great time with it. I'm pretty sure I was the only one in that screen that wasn't with anyone sitting next to me. I felt lonely :(Still, I would definitely recommend this film if you like dinosaurs, exhilarating action, amazing visuals, brilliant acting, Chris Pratt and his awesome raptor friends and stunning cinematography, then this will be your ticket. And for that alone, I'm giving this film a rightfully- deserved 9/10.",9,11,29,21 July 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far (spoiler free)
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is exactly what I wanted it to be, a fine sequel with solid pacing, directing, acting, eye gouging special effects and awesome action sequences. Before going to see this film, I looked back to the greatest movie sequels ever to make a comparison, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, (I haven't seen The Godfather Part II yet), and Avengers: Age of Ultron is definitely on the same level as all of those films. My favourite film in the MCU was undeniably Guardians of the Galaxy, but I gotta say that AOU is the best Marvel movie ever since GOTG.The cast did a fantastic job, and I literally mean each and every one of them. Robert Downey, Jr. threw it down, Chris Evans is there shining in his well-acted portrayal as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth is at his very best, Scarlett Johanson is also at her very badass best (and quite flirtatious as well I might add), Mark Ruffalo was amazing as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but Jeremy Renner stood out to me on top of all of the team. He's not my favourite Avenger, but Hawkeye was at first to me the least important guy on the team, and I thought that because he had a lack of character development in the first Avengers, but now they've done a terrific improvement on his character and they have developed him much better this time with quite an emotional core and some very good one-liners.The newcomers, I can say, without hesitation, the same for as well. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron-Taylor Johnson did a brilliant job as the two mutant twins. I do think that Evan Peters was a better version of Quicksilver when he played him in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Paul Bettany as the Vision was a show-stealer as well and he offered us his best in a well directed superhero movie. However, the newcomers all pale in comparison to James Spader's Ultron. I can see now why the cast and crew applauded him for his performance. Ultron was the real show stealer of the film and probably the best villain in the MCU and he is definitely up there with the greatest movie villains of all time, even reaching the same level as The Joker and Darth Vader. Whenever he's on screen, the movie sets the dark mood.So all in all, this is one of my favourite superhero movies ever and better than the first Avengers film in my opinion. It has a well placed focus on the title characters, the Avengers and Ultron, and after that, it has an awesome set up to Phase 3.My one problem with it is that the film wasn't as dark as the trailers suggested it would be. I just think that there should've been a little more to set the mood. It definitely does set the mood as dark as it was in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I will say that.Still, I strongly recommend you see this one. Do not miss it.",7,40,84,30 April 2015
Die Hard," My favourite action movie of all time
","Die Hard is the action movie of all action movies. Bruce Willis' John McClaine is the action hero who puts every over action hero in the dark (except perhaps the Terminator). Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber is the ultimate action movie villain. What bad things are there to say about this movie? Almost every other action movie nowadays in the 2010s I feel just constantly borrows from this one, but they will never ever top Die Hard. You cannot beat that line 'Yippee-ki-yay, motha******'.Overall, Die Hard is my favourite action movie of all time and one of my all-time favourites. I watched it the other day and I will watch it again this December just in time for Christmas, and I would recommend that you do that too. Perfect time to watch one of the best Christmas/action movies of all time.",10,1,1,30 November 2015
Steve Jobs," One of the best movies of the year
","I just got a chance to see Steve Jobs and I really liked it. I really thought it was fascinating and mesmerizing and at times, funny and touching. Michael Fassbender excels in his sensational portrayal of the legend Steve Jobs, he manages to make him the interesting, asshole-ish genius billionaire and although he might not resemble Jobs 100%, he still has the character in full force while on screen and is undoubtedly one of the best performances I've seen this year and of all time.Same praise goes to Kate Winslet; I have high hopes for her getting another look at from the Oscars come the 88th Academy Awards. She was fantastic in her role as Joanna Hoffman; she brings life, character and humanity to so many of her roles and with that range of talent, she definitely delivered in this movie. All the side cast members were amazing too; they all had big roles in the movie and they did brilliantly with the parts that they were given: Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels and Michael Stuhlbarg.Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, Oscar winner for his memorable work in 2010's The Social Network, successfully carried the film and delved deeper into Steve Jobs life and made it interesting and fascinating. Rather ironically, this same kind of success was what I recognised in The Social Network as well.So overall, Steve Jobs was a good movie, great biography, it had interesting character study and I would say that it is definitely worth your time and your money. You will not be disappointed.",8,0,3,15 November 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A flawed but fitting final chapter to the Middle-earth legend
","Let me just start off by saying that I am a big fan of The Hobbit and of The Lord of the Rings and they are some of my favourite movies of all time. When I saw the first teaser trailer for this film and the Edge of Night used as nostalgia, I nearly teared up with excitement. I remember the thrill of suddenly really looking forward to this final chapter and I didn't know what to expect, but I got what I was expecting: a great day out with my friends, Dad and sister to what was the greatest cinema experience for me. The movie had everything I wanted, the action, the acting, the tension, the drama, the thrilling sense of an apocalypse and the emotion was there too, and for that I give it full marks for that all combined.However, I have to take down one star for the major problems that I have with this movie that rob it of its masterpiece status. Like Legolas defying gravity and jumping stones like its suddenly a flipping video game in what was one of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen, and lets not forget the dull, badly-done, annoying, purposeless characters of both Tauriel and that love story that didn't have any purpose whatsoever in staying true to the classic source material, the annoying purposeless horrendous character of Alfrid Lickspittle who Peter Jackson thought was too much to kill off finally and was like 'hey I've got a great idea, lets just put in a character named Alfrid and he will always sneak into the movie and make the entire film fade out of its plot, he'll just be there to add in pointless unfunny humour.' I hate to be so negative about this movie, but I cannot help but say that all these things are just too unforgivable and if Peter Jackson could've cut all of those things out of the movie, then it would've been a better film. Also, what exactly was Legolas' purpose in the first place? Is he just there to kill orcs and to make sure that this is the same universe as The Lord of the Rings trilogy? I don't mind him being in there, but he just doesn't really have a lot of purpose to the story and I don't know why they thought that that laughable gravity defying stunt he pulled off was really necessary.I'm not to bothered about some other loose ends not being tied up, because they will explain that in the Extended Edition, but what really matters is what they put in the cinemas. Like, will we see Dáin become king?Will we see the funeral of Thorin, Fíli and Kíli? Or the reinforcements for the dwarf army coming on those rams and goats that Thorin, Dwalin,Fíli and Kíli use to ride the Ravenhill to kill Azog? Or Bard becoming the king of New Dale and Dáin giving to him what was promised of the treasure to rebuild? Or them placing the arkenstone and Thorin's sword, Orcist within his crypt? Or whether or not Thranduil is going to get those gems of pure starlight back? Or the long awaited death of Alfrid? There are also some scenes that will make you very questionable about the film. Like how after four movies of this never happening did Legolas suddenly run out of arrows? Bard using his own son, Bain, as an arrow, how Dáin and Thorin suddenly decide to hug and talk in the middle of a raging battle, and there's an overuse of a lazy action movie cliché that is last minute rescues. I mean like there's always someone in danger and then, suddenly someone else comes out of nowhere to save them at the last minute. Its very repetitive and you thought Michael Bay had a obsessive use of explosions in his films. It just gets on my nerves a little.So all of these things I have mentioned is what ruins the reputation of the film and they just need to be removed from the film completely. Still, I love this film, I've seen it four times at the cinema and I now have it on DVD and I couldn't be more happier now that I have one of my favourite franchise finales on DVD (and also with the fact that I can now skip through the love story, Legolas jumping stones and Alfrid).I know that the Dol Guldur scenes weren't in the book, but I don't really mind it being put in the film because it explains what Gandalf left the company for in the book (which wasn't entirely explained) and because it also ties the franchise up with TLOTR trilogy perfectly and it was awesome to see Sauron and Galadriel go face to face with each other. That was one of the best scenes in the film. I also liked the addition of Sir Christopher Lee's Saruman, seeing as the actor who played him recently passed away and it was good to see him retake his role of one his greatest villains ever.Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage dominate every scene of the film in their perfectly acted Oscar worthy performances as Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield. Oh, and The Last Goodbye song at the end is a perfect way to end it. The song still moves me today.Even though this film is flawed, everything else was what we all wanted, the acting, the action, the amazing visuals and the conclusion was all exactly all I could've asked for in this film and its a triumphant send-off to Middle-earth.",9,6,11,18 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Has Awakened
","Two years ago, when I found out that Disney had bought Lucasfilm Studios and were making another Star Wars film, I was enthusiastic. Then when I heard that J. J. Abrams was directing this movie, director of Star Trek (2009), I couldn't wait to see how it would go. And then, when the trailers aired, I was crying from excitement.I couldn't wait to return to that galaxy far far away, I felt like a kid about to open up his biggest present on Christmas. When I walked into the screen room, I reflected on something that Harrison Ford had said on the Jimmy Kemmel show about the movie that has stuck with me until this moment: 'It's really good. The new cast, Daisy Ridley, Jon Boyega, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac are phenomenal. J. J. has made an incredible movie, you will not be disappointed.' - Harrison Ford.And I never doubted you for a second!I will try not to spoil too much, but I will say that I loved every second of this movie, there was not one scene that did not sell me on everything that happened and every follow-up from the original trilogy did not let me down. The Force Awakens is J. J. Abrams' best work ever since Star Trek, it is visually beautiful, powerfully acted and the biggest phenomenon all year.I ended up in love with every single character, not the old, the new. Daisy Ridley's Rey was the glowing light of this entire film and her journey is the true story of this adventure. That same credit goes to Jon Boyega's Finn. The two actors had incredible chemistry together and they both were able to carry the movie and I was on board with them for every second.Harrison Ford returning as Han Solo was another wonderful treat from this movie. Him and Chewbacca have still got it and it was so great to have them both back. Whenever Ford was on screen, I was sold on every moment in his performance as he too brought heart, humour and I thought that he had a bigger and better role in this movie than he did in the entire original trilogy, and I think that he deserves an Oscar nomination this year.As for Adam Driver's Kylo Ren is the best and most menacing villain in the Star Wars saga since Darth Vader or Darth Maul. He was the biggest surprise that the movie offered. He was complex as well as a sympathetic villain.I loved the emotional core that Rey, Finn, Han Solo and Kylo Ren all brought together.Now about the nostalgia; I loved it as a Star Wars fan, but I can see why other people had a problem with it. I can agree that we needed a bit more than what we got from the nostalgia, but I really still enjoyed seeing it because this is a return to a beloved franchise but I can understand from other people's point of views. If I was being subjective though, which I am being, I would say that this movie was perfect for me. Maybe not exactly flawless, but it was one of the most holy experiences I've ever had and this movie has certainly awakened the force inside me. I now look forward to the next two installments in this new trilogy, which I am on board with.There are many moments in this movie that will make you teary eyed as well as cheer. No matter what happens this Christmas, Star Wars will be the biggest and best present that you open this year.",10,13,44,17 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The timeless adventure that began it all...
","I fell in love with Star Wars beginning with the original epic adventure since I was about 7. My childhood will never fade because of this masterpiece.George Lucas introduced us to the amazing galaxy far, far away in 1977 and changed the blockbuster generation forever and made movies bigger, more exciting and more ambitious. And introduced us to these unforgettable characters who we all get to care for. Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who finds himself in a bigger universe and starts a new journey for himself. Princess Leia, leader of the Rebel Alliance against the evil Galactic Empire. Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon and scoundrel and his hairy wookiee sidekick, Chewbacca 'Chewie' as he calls him. C-3P0 and R2-D2 the two droids who help our heroes along the way. And of course, Obi-Wan Kenobi, the legendary Jedi Master who vows to teach Luke to become a Jedi like his father.All of these characters are forever to be remembered. The special effects changed cinematography and visual effects to a whole new level to what we all see in films today. If it weren't for Star Wars, we would never have any film love in the first place. It's why we watch movies and they don't make anything like this anymore.The epic adventure will always be the adventure of all adventures.",10,1,2,26 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The symbol for what a great sequel should be
","The Empire Strikes Back is the most suspenseful, well-paced and most emotional entry of the Star Wars saga. It's the greatest of movie sequels and as far as it goes, it is everything a sequel to a great movie is supposed to be: a darker tone, more development with the characters, universe expanding with some new and greater additions and features.The perfect adventure telling story that continues from where it left off from and delved deeper into the characters we all know and love today and introduced bigger places in the galaxy far far away that George Lucas originally introduced to us. The action is stunning, the visuals still look ground-breaking today. Empire overall, is just the best movie sequel ever and I don't know if I can call it the best of the original trilogy because its a tough choice between the three of them, to me.But I still love The Empire Strikes Back so 10/10.",10,2,4,3 December 2015
Spectre," Over-hyped, but not underwhelming: Spectre is Spectacular!
","Let me start off by saying that I am a huge James Bond fan and Skyfall is one of my favourite movies of all time and my favourite spy movie and 007 movie of all time. I have been so excited to see the next movie in Daniel Craig's rebooted series and the wait was definitely worth it.Spectre was the best follow-up to Skyfall that I could've hoped for. Daniel Craig plays James Bond as a badass elusive assassin this time around very well and it was just awesome seeing him back in action. Ben Whishaw is still kills it as the MI6 Quartermaster (Q) and Léa Snydoux is another great female lead in this new Bond outing. With some exceptions, I feel like most of the 007 girls pale in comparison to this new heroine, Madeline Swan, except Vesper from Casino Royale. I feel like she has a great background and a great story.Onto Ralph Fiennes as M, I never expected that he would portray the character as well as he did. He will never beat Judi Dench's M, in my opinion, but he still manages to bring amazing range to the role and he was a real show stealer.But the star of the film who really led the film in a great direction was Christoph Watlz's Franz Oberhauser. How is he, you might ask? He was awesome! Probably the scariest and most menacing Bond villain since Rhaoul Silva. He's a villain that you take seriously, I took him seriously, so I hold no doubts that you will take him seriously too. Like, when you predict what he's planning next, you can see what's coming, but when it does come, it hits you like a brick. And to those of you who are disappointed that they spoiled him in the trailer and if you think that the whole experience is now gone, I will say that it isn't, you haven't seen anything yet. I can't think of anyone else they could've gotten better to play this chilling role and it was just awesome seeing him and Bond going head-to-head.The action was just a thrilling spectacle. Seriously, if your still geeking out about Tom Cruise hanging out of a flying airplane in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, then take a look at Daniel Craig holding onto a flying helicopter that's swinging around, trying to shake him off while he gets a bad guy. The action itself, overall, in Spectre was just classic old Bond action just like the good old times; Bond gets new villains to fight, there's more gun play and sex play, its just Bond back in full force going up against his most worthy adversary yet.So overall, I really enjoyed Spectre, although I will say that it's still not as great as Skyfall and it felt a little over-hyped, but it is still the best Bond movie we could've gotten this year and it brings everything die-hard fans love about the franchise. I went to see it yesterday and the day before that, so it was a real treat for me, Spectre did not disappoint me at all and it has one of my favourite movies of the year.Oh, and Sam Smith's song 'Writings on the Wall', while not as good as Adele's 'Skyfall', was still the perfect theme for the movie; it sets the tone of the film really well and its a very moving, enchanting in a way song.9/10 Do not hesitate to buy tickets for Spectre. It is one of this year's most unmissable movies.",9,16,38,28 October 2015
Warcraft," Worth checking for anyone who's a World of Warcraft fan, now as a movie...
","I went into Warcraft with high hopes and expectations, much like Batman v. Superman, and much like BVS most of my expectations were let down by a few things that I found wrong with the movies themselves. However, I will say that I thought Warcraft was better then BVS in terms of character arcs, interesting story and better- handled action.Before I go on let me just make it clear that I myself am not a hardcore WOW fan myself, but my friends at secondary school told me everything about the lore and since then we always talked about it. Deathwing has always been my favourite character though, and if the studios are planning on bringing him into any future Warcraft movies then I'd slap down £15 to go see that! Assuming of course they'll will be good sequels (fingers crossed).But back to the film itself, there are some neat stuff and some bad stuff. The bad stuff I'll focus on first, mostly to do with the pacing. This movie is two and a half hours long and at a point, my friend's sister fell asleep almost half way through, mostly because it was rather a late screen timing that the film was on at. The pacing of this movie really dragged on, and I felt like the narrative was a little unfocused and the characters and lore of Warcraft were both not given the proper development (unless this turns out to be the start of a series, perhaps trilogy, I hope it is so they can explain more).However, that's not to say that I didn't like the movie because of those things. I actually really liked this movie for the most part because it at least had enough interesting characters with deep emotion and amazing visual spectacle and epic gritty action sequences to the film a thrilling and enjoyable movie-going experience for me.The main villain, I thought was delivered great justice, the main orc character, Durotan, I thought was hands down the best part of the movie as well as the main human character, Lothar, who I really liked as well. Daniel Wu, Toby Kebbell and Travis Fimmel did a spectacular job and I was on board with their characters throughout the movie. The rest of the characters felt sort of bland to me, but I felt like they had some good story arcs there and interesting depth to them at the same time.So overall, I would recommend Warcraft to see for yourself and see what you thought, especially if your a Warcraft fan, then you have yourself some fan service.As it stands now, Warcraft, I feel deserves a 7/10.",7,3,5,21 June 2016
Back to the Future," My favourite movie of all time
","It's a teenage movie, it's a comedy, it's a science fiction adventure... and there's nothing better.Back to the Future is a smart inventive all-time masterpiece and I have never known any other movie that I have seen that I have watched over and over again and again, that's how much I love this movie. The cast and their chemistry on screen are unforgettable: Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is an energetic teenager with a passion for music and someone who does not want you to call 'chicken'.Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown is a scientist who wants to invent something unique that works and to change the world. With his new invention of time travel that he made out of a DeLorean. Christopher Lloyd's performance was not nominated for an Oscar because his performance was the most fascinating part of the movie and one of the most interesting performances in a movie that I've seen in a long while. More praise goes to Chrispin Glover's performance as George McFly. He was my favourite part of the movie, especially the two scenes where he tries to woo Lorraine Baines and says 'I'm your density' one of my favourite movie quotes. The moment in the film (SPOILERS just in case you haven't seen it yet) where he stands up to Biff surprised me and showed me that he could stand up for himself and the woman he loves. Lea Thompson was fantastic as well as Lorraine Baines.Back to the Future was something that surprised me because I never knew now how much I would love it. I don't know if I've ever felt this good about a movie in a long time since I first watched Jaws or Whiplash.10/10",10,4,5,20 November 2015
The Martian," Cast Away meets Sci-Fi, at its peak
","This is not one of those far fetched plots that drag on for hours like Interstellar or Gravity, this is a gripping and powerful space opera epic and its called The Martian.The Martian was just one of the best three hour moments of my movie- loving marathon this year in 2015. Yes, that's how good it is. It is the best sci-fi space opera movie in the last three years. Gravity was just a beautiful technology show-off, Interstellar was a far fetched waste of potential and The Martian was just the amazing steps ahead of both those two movies that I, personally, don't like very much. The Martian is Ridley Scott's best movie, ever. I will be making that argument that it is definitely his best film that I've seen, not just my favourite, but his best.Matt Damon's fantastic role and performance was not the only greatest thing about this movie, the co-stars were really good as well and I mean all of them, Sebastian Shan, Jessica Chastian, Michael Peña and Mara Bell (which excuses her terrible role in Fantastic Four this year). Ridley Scott's directing is at it's finest, he really knows which scene should be the most emotional or the most funniest and he succeeds in making it both memorable and great, I am going to remember every scene in this movie where I was laughing my head off and when I was tearing up, there were about one or two moments during the film where I was nearly crying man tears.I never expected that much from this movie, but it still resides with me now, the story, the incredible cinematography, the amazing performances and the fact that this is not just one of those fun popcorn movies like a lot of movies were this year, this is one that I am going to remember about a decade from now. The Martian has to be one of my favourite movies this year, I guarantee that it will be among my Top 5 this year. I would strongly recommend that you go and see this movie, trust me, you will have a fun great time with it, just like I did.10/10",10,3,40,4 October 2015
Furious 7," Cheesy at times, but ultimately one of the best action movies I have ever seen in a while
","I will admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but Fast & Furious 7 was a real treat in the early days of 2015. It was an intensely thrilling action packed joy ride and I had a really great time watching Furious 7.Firstly, I will admit that there were some moments in the film that I felt were a little out of place sort of. Although those moments didn't exactly drop the film in a way, they were just a little unrealistic. I also thought that they could've used Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson a lot more in this movie since he only had about 10 minutes of screen time, if not less.That all aside, this was classic explosive Fast & Furious car action. Vin Diesel was amazing in this movie; this time around he plays a more dramatic role since this movie pays a tribute to recently deceased star of the franchise, Paul Walker, making this movie more of a drama than a thriller action film, which I think does it's job really really well at that. I'll admit, I was tearing up at that point.Jason Statham also kills it in this movie. I've admired his acting skills, but I think this is the movie that I am going to remember him from the most out of every movie he's done. He is a good actor, but as the main villain in this movie, Deckard Shaw, I thought he delivered the most.Overall, I had a blast with Fast & Furious 7, it was exciting and emotional, it made us all laugh and cry. I have listened to that song by Charlie Puth and Wiz Khalifa 'See You Again' so many times, I love that song, it's a perfect way to carry the film's emotional tribute to Paul Walker and to give him the perfect send-off.For Paul 9.9/10",9,33,39,1 December 2015
