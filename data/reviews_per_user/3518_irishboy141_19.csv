",Boring... Boring... So Boring....The 4th best in the franchise.,1,0,3,22 May 2019
The Polar Express," It's okay, but the animation hasn't aged well
","Watching this movie in 2019, I felt a disconnect between me and the film. The director seemed to be more interested in the 'cutting edge' effects of the time that hasn't aged well. There are several Derpy kid faces, weird lip sync issues, and several creepy uncanny valley faces.The story is taken from a children's story book, so I didn't expect very much. However there are several moments of obvious fluff scenes that exist simply to pad the running time. the scenes that come to mind are; the scene where we follow the ticket out the window and in the mouth of an eagle (I'm sure it was cool in IMAX at the time, but it didn't age well and doesn't hold a candle to the likes of the 'How to Train your Dragon' series), the rooftop train scene, the entirety of the Hobo character, sneaking around the North Pole, the Caribou scene, and the train on ice scene. this movie could've been and maybe should've been a half hour HBO special.Tom Hanks plays most of the characters and he carries this movie, the little black girl's singing was great, but her character design slipped into the uncanny valley several times.Ironically the gimmick-y 'motion tracking animation' is the very thing that holds the film back. Either it's character's are too creepy because they're real people's movements just overly animated, or it's really boring because of the character's stiff (realistic) movements.I would love to have Dreamworks remake this movie more cartoony in the style of 'How to train your Dragon' to make it more visually appealing and entertaining.As is, it's fine.",5,3,5,4 December 2019
Bird Box," A worse version of 'A Quiet Place'
","The rules for this horror film make no sense in regards to how the monsters effect you (you either kill yourself or go crazy, whatever is more convienent for the script). Also in one scene the monsters violently shake a car, but the monsters can't touch or harm people with blindfolds on.The acting is subpar at best from Sandra Bullock on down to the terrible child actors.The film is structured non linearly in a way that kills all mystery and tension for the future plot. Very strange way to tell the story.Oh and also there are schools for the blind hidden deep in the woods... this movie is so stupid... skip this shame.",1,4,5,27 March 2019
Dunkirk," Technically incredible, populated by hollow humans
","On a Technical level (sound, editing, effects, ect.) it's fantastic. It all looks and feels incredibly authentic (except for the perfect looking town next to the beach should be bombed out and the shore should look like it has more than 1,000 background extras inhabiting it).The film fails in it's characters and the way the story is presented. I feel nothing for any of the characters, they feel like empty vessels. and the film has 5 stories all intercut with each other, and they each take place during different times of day. It's weird and I found it garring.It's a solid 'meh'/10",6,0,2,25 October 2018
Twilight," Pretty funny watching it now
","I first saw this movie when I was getting out of middle school and found it very boring, shallow, and not very good (the same feelings I hold for the other films). I have grown as a person and have learned a lot more about filmmaking in the years since it was release, are these films better now?Upon revisiting, this is almost 'so bad it's good'. I can see now that the bad acting, hilarious effects, and awkward moments make this film kinda bearable now. (Edward 'running' through the forest cracks me up every time).It's still pretty boring and lame, I can't recommend sitting through it again, but it's a little more bearable now, I rank it the 3rd best in the franchise.",1,2,5,22 May 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," What a reboot!
","I saw this film in theaters and it knocked my socks off. The screen writer, director, and Andy Serkis really out-did themselves.This acts as a prequel to the original series telling the rise of intelligent Apes and the starting decline of humanity. a genetically altered Ape, Caesar, is raised by James Franco and through some less than wacky antics is forced to be kept in a ape shelter with other, normal apes. Similar to the god Prometheus, Caesar exposes his fellow apes to the gene altering virus and gives them knowledge. thus empowering them to rebel and escape captivity.The humans are by far the weakest link in this film. James Franco is okay and everyone else is passable, but none are very imaginative or memorable. Meanwhile all the apes are interesting, memorable and carry over throughout the remaining trilogy (Rocket, Koba, and my favorite Maurice).While this reboot trilogy focuses less on themes of racism and slavery, I feel the themes are still there, it's just more themes are at the center and room is made for very decent action sequences. I really liked this film and it sent the series in a brand new direction.",8,1,2,4 December 2018
Aladdin," Another hollow, pointless remake banking on nostalgia
","If you've been watching any of the Disney 'live action' remakes that have plagued us the last the last several years, then this one should come as no surprise as it contains all the same pitfalls.The setting feels fake, they either filmed on a green screen or filmed on a soundstage with a green screen background/skyline.The music is generic and could've been crammed into any movie (even a non musical).The direction/editing is boring and uninspired containing lots of flat, static shots and predictable edits.There are slight alterations to the plot that you'll either love or hate.The acting is pretty bad for the most part Aladdin has no presence, Jasmine is ok, Jafar is terrible and isn't intimidating, Will Smith is surprisingly fine as the Genie (though I did go in with subterranean expectations), but the effects aren't good that and he slips into the creepy uncanny valley quite a lot.If you liked previous live action remakes, then you're almost sure to like this one. However if you find this trend of filmmaking uninspired, mediocre, and ultimately pointless, then skip this one and just watch the original.",1,392,842,22 May 2019
The Lion King," A worthless rehash
","The only positives I have to say is that some of the effects are excellent, and James Earl Jones still has a great voice, Seth Rogen was fine. Everything else is bad.The direction is flat and without style or substance, most likely due to the constrictive nature of having the entire movie be 'photorealistic' CGI.The environments themselves are dull and shallow, it really shows off how excellent the original 2D animated one was in it's colorful settings and inventive musical/dance numbers. In this imitation whenever a song plays here we just have realistic (and sometimes terrible/rubbery looking) animals jogging along a boring, drab jungle.Most of the characters are hollow shells of their original counterparts, especially Scar. Instead of being a sleek lion (expertly voiced by Jeremy Irons) who chews the scenery , and genuinely loves being evil; Now he's just some dirty/malnourished looking lion who sounds like some random guy off the street. Not intimidating in the slightest.I don't really have much else to say... It's the typical modern Disney cash grab remake; they use the same plot with minor alterations, with 'live action' slapped on it as some sort of gimmick to get the dumb popcorn chewing masses into the theater. It's the visual equivalent of highly processed pig slop, it is to art what drawing a moustache on the Mona Lisa is (the same thing, but slightly altered).",1,203,414,12 July 2019
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Funnier than the first
","I first saw this movie when I was in high school and found it almost as boring, and shallow as the first one. I have grown as a person and have learned a lot more about filmmaking in the years since it was release, is this film better now?Nope. I find it funner than the first, but it's still very boring. Not much really happens in the story. Ed leaves, Bella mopes, Jacob tries to get in on the action, then Bella leaves to bring Ed back. The only thing that really happens is that the elder Vampires know Bella is dating Ed, I guess.... Funnier moments sure, but more boring because less stuff happens.It's still pretty lame, I can't recommend sitting through it, but it's a little funnier than the first, I rank it the 2nd best in the franchise.",2,0,2,22 May 2019
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Wonderful and artsy
","This film is fantastic!The filmmaking on display is astonishing and bursting with personality. I am amazing by the skill and craftsmanship on display from Halloweentown to the Christmas Village, to the real world. I used to hate this film when I was little, but as I've gotten older and learned about filmmaking, I keep finding aspects to appreciate in this classic film. The music, animation, story, voice acting, and ending are all excellent.I have no complaints, Watch this masterpiece if you haven't already.",9,2,2,23 October 2018
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Breaking Wind Part 2
","The most entertaining film in the franchise. It still has the hilariously bad acting, a creepy CGI baby and awkward moments, but damn is that final battle entertaining.Hilariously bad and a schlocky final battle.Best in the franchise, for what little that's worth.",2,3,5,22 May 2019
Beauty and the Beast," A shameless rehash banking on nostalgia
","First off the movie isn't bad, it's just boring as sin and does nothing interesting. Emma Watson plays Emma Watson cosplaying as Belle, Every character feels like a poor imitation of the 1991 classic.The special effects on the beast look fine today, but I can tell it'll age poorly by next year (they should've used a prosthetic suit/make up).The only thing I can praise is the set design in the castle, It's fantastic.All in all, this isn't a movie, it's a product to suck money out of Disney lover's wallets. and it worked perfectly. It's not bad and general movie goers would (and do) like it. It's just a bland corporate product, it was made exactly as intended.",2,5,8,25 October 2018
It's a Wonderful Life," The best Christmas movie ever, and the best Christian movie ever
","This film is a wonderful classic I watch every year. It has great acting especially for the time it was made, the acting and the accents feel authentic and real by modern movie standards. This film perfectly captures the feeling and moral of the Christmas season.It also manages to be a wonderful Christian film if one chooses to look at it like that. The thing this film does that garbage like; Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas, God's not Dead, or any Pureflix propaganda film does not is It's foremost a movie with deep characters who are flawed and likeable. It doesn't shove the message down your throat in some ham fistted/embarrising way. It's masterful storytelling plain and simple.Such a wonderful film deserves to be seen by everyone. Watch it If you haven't already.",10,0,0,24 October 2018
Halloween," It's Iconic and defined the Genre
","I recently watched this film for the first time and loved it. The direction, the visuals, music, color pallet, Michael Meyers and Laurie's acting are all fantastic. This movie was made on a shoe string budget but masterfully crafted, and it holds up to this day.It's a classic, watch it if you haven't already It's still a fantastic film.",9,0,0,23 October 2018
The Greatest Showman," An OK musical, but a dismal hostorical film
","Let's start with the positives, The choreography is good, I kinda liked Zac Efron's character, and I thought the child acting was fine.My main problems with this film stems from how pandering and inoffensive it tries to be.The real life P.T. Barnum was a slimey crooked scumbag who tried to get rich off anyone, he even coined the phrase, 'There's a sucker born every minute.' So when this story tries to depict him as an innocent guy trying to 'do the right thing' I can't help but feel the film is trying to pathetically bamboozle me in to sympathizing for a scumbag character. It also bothers me that the inter-racial relationship between Zac's character and the trapeze artist is glossed over, that would be interesting to explore that dynamic in the late 1800s, but no we have to keep things simple for mass audience appeal...Now to be fair, there are those audience members who don't give a crap about historical accuracy, and that's fine. However even with out the historical inaccuracies, the film still fails for me due to the overly simplistic nature of the plot. P.T. is poor boy, poor boy likes rich girl, rich girl likes poor boy but rich parents don't approve. The same tired plot with an unrealistic main character. (For example, when EVERYONE goes to visit the Queen of England, in real life it was just P.T. and the Little Person Napoleon.Another thing that bothers me is the CGI in this movie, it all looks so fake, even when they're in physical locations, the backgrounds and everything look so phoney. Also the Little Person actor looked digitally altered somehow, and his real voice was badly dubbed over and looks terrible.Oh and of course the critic in the film is joyless and unhappy (what the studio thinks the naysayers of this film are like). Which is a cliche that always bothers me, but after ragging on P.T. the whole movie, in the last 15 minutes he complements P.T. and his show..... for some reason.Anyhoo, aside from one or two decent songs/dances (the bar scene in particular was very nice). I wasn't impressed by this film, it's better than Marry Poppins Returns, but it's sure no Chicago or Rocky Horror Picture Show.",5,1,3,1 February 2019
Green Book," This never rose above mediocre
","This is one of the blandest and most simplistic depictions of racism I've ever seen in a movie since 2006's trash film Crash.The only part of this movie that passes as okay is some of the acting. But even then I never bought Viggo Mortensen or Mashallah Ali's characters. They tried with what they had, but they had poor direction.There's a distinct lack of grit and cursing in this film about traveling through the south with a black man and that really bugged me.Also for some reason this film is shot like a comedy while tackling a very serious subject, it's a very odd clash... oh my god the worst thing about this movie (besides the simplified story/cartoonishly simplistic view of racism) is the 'comedy'. I never laughed once at any of the jokes, but I did laugh at Viggo's hilariously stereotypical Italian accent, It's like watching Mario audition for Glory.Also the musical score.for the film is pretty bad and bland, it's mostly violin music played to 'enhance emotion' moments. It all feels so manipulative.Anyhoo, I feel old white people will like this movie, but younger audiences will see through this phoney film and be mostly bored.",1,23,58,16 March 2019
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The most worthless entry
","This is the most boring movie and I honestly forgot it existed. You could cut this movie out of the franchise and nothing would be different. I know because I did, I watched 1, 2, 4, & 5 and only realized afterwards that this film exists.Nothing of consequence happens, a native american killed herself a while ago so a Vampire would be distracted so her wolf hubby could kill it. that's all i remember.Needless to say it's the worst of the franchise.",1,0,2,22 May 2019
Annihilation," Movies like this just aren't made anymore...
","This is a wonderful sci-fi horror film that is legitimatley unnerving. It takes it's time, develops characters, builds tension, pays off beautifully and doesn't treat the audience like idiots.The acting is great, the direction is wonderful, the editing is very deliberate, and the filmmaking on display is simply wonderful.If you want to see a truley unique film that gets under your skin and makes you think, look no further.",10,0,5,10 August 2018
Shark Tale," Garbage that has not aged well
","This is a generic ganster movie disguised as a kids film. It has product placement out the wazoo. And the only reason it's animated was to leech off the sucess of Finding Nemo; I'm dead serious, the story itself would not change if you made it live action and set it in New York. Aside from that; the 'characters' are shot like humans are shot in live action (because this movie was made by hacks), the voice acting is terrible, the 'characters' are boring stereotypes, the plot is generic, the color pallet is ugly, the characters are ugly, the environment is ugly, and since I'm reviewing this movie in 2018, I can say this feels so dated and disgusting.Skip this trash and watch Finding Nemo.",1,3,6,10 January 2018
