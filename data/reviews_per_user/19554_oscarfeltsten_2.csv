Hereditary," An overrated paper-thin film
","Just like Midsommar, the film's script is predictable, boring, and almost non-existant. Vastly overrated. The only ositives are the technical aspects.",4,1,3,9 June 2020
Midsommar," Overrated
","It looks good, but it's god-awfully long. Too many scenes of characters just doing nothing. Incredibly disappointing.",2,11,15,31 May 2020
