Ford v Ferrari," Awesome just totally spectacular
",Pure entertainment. Storytelling at its best. Not one political agenda addressed. Not one sjw box checked. A masterclass in entertainment designed for those who watch movies to be entertained. Masterpiece. Satisfying until the credits roll at the end. Do not miss this amazing movie,10,1,7,18 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Being held hostage by Marvel. Not at all happy
",Unfortunately I have to watch this drivel simply to know what to expect in endgame. But at the very least Marvel didn't make a dime off me. I paid for Alita and then watched Captain Marvel. After seeing this movie and what they let that woman do to the fan base that made this franchise. Marvel will never ever see another dime from me.,1,123,227,9 March 2019
Molly's Game," Great poker movie
",There hasn't been a good poker movie released since Rounders. This movie remedies that situation. Throw in a little legal drama a little organized crime and Idris Elba proving that he is an absolutely amazing actor,8,3,5,8 April 2019
Aladdin," Miscast
",I started at a 7 cuz I'm not sure yet. But so far I believe it's incredibly miscast. The guy playing Jafar in particular. It just seems way too young and not nearly ominous enough.. I do believe they could have done much better. but I'm only about a half hour in so we'll see,7,5,17,26 May 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Meh.
","I could see it being offensive on so many levels to so many older generation people. I mean. World War II is one of the most tragic events in modern history. On the other hand, taika waititi ,as much as a powderpuff liberal as he is ,has the gift of crafting of wonderfully hysterical movie. I'm torn. I really am. I give it a five. I choose to never be offended so I can enjoy the movie. I guess my main issue is, that the people who are constantly offended are normally liberal, Powder Puff , sjws. And I know is a fact if the director of this movie was a conservative the same people who are raving about how beautiful this movie is would be bashing it. It's the typical double standard. That being said I still recommend this movie it's absolutely brilliant",4,13,81,26 October 2019
Annihilation," High concept, dark and somber
","I normally don't try to fill up my reviews with non consequential over exaggerated explanations.
I try to just give my opinion and how entertaining or not entertaining a particular movie was to me personally. 
So here it is in a nutshell .
Highly entertaining. 
True sci-fi fans will love it,especially those who read a lot of sci-fi. 
Many will find it to slow, most will, in fact .
Dark.
Humorless. 
Creepy. 
Amazing. 
A little gory. 
Beautiful. 
Somber. 
High concept. 
People often say about a movie 
'It's this movie plus that movie ' 
Well. ....I'll try that angle. 
It's 'Arrival '+'Prometheus '+'2001'+'Predator '.
Plus a half dozen others. 
It's a good approaching great movie.",7,2,7,15 March 2018
