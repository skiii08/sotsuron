National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Utterly enjoyable blockbuster with a sprinkling of entertaining nonsense.
","A sequel is something that is never needed, unless continuing a specific story arc, so a sequel to 2004's National Treasure is without a doubt an unnecessary venture. Basically, this film is a take it or leave it kind of entertainment, though if you enjoyed the original, this one won't disappoint.Picking up a few years after the events of National Treasure, we find Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage) living with his father (Jon Voight) after being booted out of his own house by girlfriend Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) has written a book that no-one wants to read and has had his beloved Ferrari towed. Life is hard for our characters, but you can be sure that a new treasure hunt will take place sometime in the next two hours to give them a new equilibrium to look forward to.From the rousing opening scene depicting the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, we are thrown into a non-stop whirlwind of globe trotting and treasure seeking. We find out that a man named Wilkinson (Ed Harris) is in possession of a lost page from the diary of John Wilkes Booth which suggests Thomas Gates' involvement in the conspiracy. Thomas Gates is great, great grandfather to Benjamin Gates so naturally Gates will do anything to clear his family name.There are quite a few familiar faces from the first film in this second outing, right down to Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight, and all seem to be having a great deal of fun with this enjoyable nonsense. Cage is at his crazy best, be it running from rival treasure hunters or staging a hilarious argument with his ex girlfriend in the middle of Buckingham Palace, he's unrestrained and is allowed to go wild which is exactly the kind of thing this movie needs. It saved Ghost Rider from being anything less than diverting, anyway. Justin Bartha's return as the wisecracking sidekick, still cracking wise, is either annoying or charming, depending which way you lean. Diane Kruger is still beautiful and has great timing, the only thing that really elevates her from her eye-candy position. Helen Mirren also makes an appearance here in a role that she didn't really need, but she looks like she's enjoying herself anyhow. She serves simply to squabble with Jon Voight as Cage squabbles with Kruger, which doesn't amount to anything more than a few extra comedic elements. Ed Harris plays a carbon copy of Sean Bean's role in the original, which in itself was a cardboard cutout bad guy role. It's not essential for the antagonist to be particularly formidable in these movies, sneering will do, but Harris' supposed ambiguity is a real weak point in the script. It's a waste considering Harris has experience in this area, what with The Rock and A History of Violence under his belt, but here he doesn't manage to be a particularly memorable or well drawn character.It feels like the two films were made back to back. The energy is still the same, all the actors seem like they never took a break, right down to the musical score, shooting style and Cage's toupe√©. If it ain't broke, don't fix. It's maybe not as tight as the first film, allowing a little flab to get in, mainly towards the middle and again during the finale, but it doesn't last very long and soon we're back in full flow again. The outcome of the clues is of course preposterous and on too large a scale to simply dismiss, the contrivance of the treasure resting place too familiar, but this at least doesn't diminish the overall fun of the flick.Of the two treasure hunting movies to come off the back of Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code, National Treasure was always the more fun, beating the other movie hands down, even though it was directed by Ron Howard and actually was The Da Vinci Code. This second instalment doesn't want to do anything more than the same and, against all the odds, they churned out a crowd pleasing thrill ride of pure entertainment. It's a tad smarter, funnier and more endearing than the average blockbuster (especially when looking back at 2007) and the action, while by the numbers, doesn't disappoint either. For a fun night out, it's a sure thing, if almost instantly forgettable. If this movie does well, a loose end in the plot promises yet another sequel. Do we need it? No. Will it be as good? Probably not. Will we see it? Quite possibly, because we never learn.",7,13,22,20 December 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Gargantuan.
","In terms of conflicting emotions regarding the audiences reactions to certain characters, Tarantino has once and for all given us the mess with our minds that we deserve. 'Insomnia' had a cop whom killed his partner and covered it up, but we know that through it all, I couldn't have gone any other way. Kill Bill Vol 1 had a back story to cold killer O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) told in Anime, one of the most expressive mediums and actually gave the character a sympathy. Vernita Green's (Vivica A Fox) daughter (who will undoubtedly come back later) watches as the bride kills her mother. In Volume 2, the sympathy and emotion for the bad characters are heightened and the one man whom you thought you would hate the most of the five on the dead list becomes one of the most sympathetic, charming characters of the film, despite what he did at the El Paso chapel not four years ago.David Carradine plays Bill with menace and charm, a combination that doesn't always work with todays ineffective and forgettable villains. Having said that, the title's payoff did come out a little flat and empty. Maybe Tarantino was trying to relate how revenge is not always sweet and convey the emptiness The Bride must have felt subsequently. If that's the case, he succeeded. If his goal was simply 'to kick ass', it was flat. Budd, Bill's brother, is just trying to make buck or two, but, as he so rightly states, they all deserve to die. Elle driver is the only one who is all bad. A bitch to the end. We never thought the mermaid from splash was capable of it. Hats off to Daryl Hannah.One of the greatest things about volume 2 is a welcome back for the Tarantino dialogue and some of the most luscious cinematography ever seen on film. He states himself that its a departure, he admits to homage, never to plagiarism. Those of you with an open mind will agree with him. How many times has a film style or genre, even story, been recycled and recycled and no-one bats an eyelid. Gus Van Sant remade Psycho shot for shot from the same script and no one said a word, but you put down Tarantino for imaginative and frankly incredible use of his movie influences? I've had my rant, and Tarantino is in no way overrated. These two films are one big masterpiece and should be treated as such and, if possible, should be taken together.",Null,2,6,26 August 2004
Spider-Man 3," Entertaining, but not up to the standard set by Raimi himself.
","In this third instalment of the popular comic book franchise, Spider-Man is up against not one, not two, but three opponents. A black gooey alien symbiote that's just conveniently crash landed from outer space and heightens the inner evil (or mildly testy, as the case is here) of anyone it attaches itself to, The Sandman who is yet another product of a freak accident and The Green Goblin's son, Harry, who slips onto Dad's glider for a little revenge, plus the addition of rival love interest Gwen Stacy to complicate Spidey's relationship with girlfriend Mary Jane Watson and the issue of Eddie Brock, a photographer who is vying for Peter's job to further complicate matters for the wall crawler.From reading that overlong sentence, you can just about get an idea of the movie - unnecessarily jam packed with too much information. The movie begins where the last left off, with Peter and Mary Jane very much in love and Peter and Harry very much in hate. On his way home, Peter is ambushed by a newly re-muscled Harry on his glider, providing us with our very first set-piece of the movie. This is a painstakingly planned sequence, director Sam Raimi doing what he does best with his camera. Unfortunately, one cannot help but notice some of the awful full body CGI stunt men doubling for Harry and Peter. If you are eagle eyed enough to notice, you'll see this popping up throughout, jolting the viewer out of the movie.Next we are introduced to Flint Marko, a criminal on the run who, after visiting his dying daughter, falls into a sand pit in which an unexplained particle experiment is going on (don't people read danger signs anymore?) and becomes one with the sand particles, able to shape shift and get in places people didn't know they could get sand in. The Sandman seems nothing more than another version of The Mummy, but nevertheless, Raimi manages to conjure up some interesting new visuals. The shame of it all is that the poor guy is in fact non-essential to the movie overall. His back story is a wholly unnecessary addition to events in the first Spider-Man movie and serves only to provide evil, black suited Spidey with some questionable actions to execute as a result of emotional turmoil. By the end of the film, Sandman is nothing more than a big, hulking, growling CG creation and finally, a footnote to be checked off the list of loose ends to tie up. The most telling piece of information is in the very first featurette on the DVD. Producer Avi Arad's first words to camera are how Sandman was a great opportunity for CGI. Ah. It all makes sense.Now we come to yet another plot point, in which the alien goop connects itself to Peter's suit, creating a black suited Spidey, or 'evil' Spidey. Evil Spidey is not given a great deal of evil to actually do. Evil for Spidey is simply combing his hair downwards and behaving like a lad who has had one too many pints down the pub. Maguire does quite an impressive job conveying the 'quasi evil' side of Spidey and is obviously having fun with it, but is constricted by the limitations of the script.There are some potentially rich character developments which are squandered in favour of packing in as much as possible. Gwen Stacy, a pivotal character in the comics who was forfeited in favour of skipping straight to Mary Jane for the first film, is wasted here in a silly subplot to make Mary Jane jealous. For what it's worth, Bryce Dallas Howard is still charming in the role, but she is short changed in favour of simply having her show up and say 'hi' to comic book fans. There's also a jarring bit of lazy resolution in the use of a shameless deus ex machina to resolve Harry's story, something which sours the rest of the film more than the overstuffed showdowns and multiple endings. Finally, Venom, fan favourite, is created by Peter's leftover goop attaching itself to Eddie Brock, played sarcastically by Topher Grace. Criminally, this happens in the last reel, giving Venom precious little screen time and rendering him another side note. He would have been better served either as main villain or as an appetite whetter for part 4 in the final frame.This is a prime example of sacrificing the integrity of story, character and structure simply to give the fans on the internet what they're screaming to see. Ironically, it's the same fans that tear the film apart after it's release. Despite that, there are still plenty of things to enjoy about this film. The various action sequences, while seemingly rushed are still spectacular and fun to watch, the now famous Saturday Night Fever strut equally so and an amusing, if slightly out of place cameo from Raimi regular Bruce Campbell as an inept Maitre d' is bound to raise a smile.As a cinematic experience, Spider-Man 3 is not completely unsatisfying. It contains all the fun, zest and passion for the material as the first two but the over-stuffed narrative and short changing of potentially dynamic characters is an unforgivable mistake and the law of diminishing returns threatens to plague the web crawler still further should this series continue. By the finale, all the story lines have crashed into each other messily, culminating in yet another MJ hostage situation, begging the question, do these villains have no imagination?THE BOTTOM LINE: Good solid blockbuster fun with all the trimmings of the first two, but bigger, faster, louder and more is not always the best policy. Multiple story lines are deftly woven together for most of the running time but clumsily crash together in the finale. Better than most sequels, but not as good as the standard that this franchise sets for itself.",6,0,1,28 April 2009
Cloverfield," Not worth the hype, but entertaining all the same.
","It's obvious that Cloverfield had a bout of over-hyping, mainly due to the innovative ad campaign which basically equates to the idea that anything hinted at in a trailer sends internet fanboys in a flurry of excitement and speculation. The downside is that all the anticipation can result in a resounding thud (Star Wars, but hopefully not the upcoming Indy flick). Thankfully, this film geek chose to acknowledge yet ignore all the internet madness and wait for the flick to be released. That means none of the meticulous freeze framing of the trailer to get a gander at the antagonistic 'thing' that decapitated the statue of liberty and the like.So, was Cloverfield worth all the brouhaha? Well, yes and no. The fact is, the premise is not revolutionary and nor is the style, it's most obvious comparison being The Blair Witch Project which debuted 9 years ago to a similar fanfare (we had the poster in our common room before we even knew what it was). The main pull here is the use of character and perspective as we follow a group of New Yorkers desperately trying to survive in the wake of a monster attack. Despite reviews to the contrary, these characters are pretty well realised compared to conventional fare such as Godzilla in which we are given a linear and straightforward introduction to them, whereas here, we are treated to fragmented pieces of overlapping footage to tell the story so far.The way the film has been shot, as if on DV camcorder, feels authentically like a home movie, which at the beginning is to the film's detriment, but it becomes obvious why the first act needed to be as it was once disaster hits. It may take a little getting used to, but it's worth it. The CG is integrated almost perfectly, glimpses here and there and feels more real than any of the robots or web slingers of last year that Hollywood offered us. In fact, the weakest point of the film is seeing the creature in full, whereas the aforementioned flicks would have thrived on that very thing.So the point is not inherently in the idea, but the execution which is pretty effective. At one point I found myself holding my breath when dust engulfed the characters and gripping the seat when several memorable shocks presented themselves, the most notable instances involving a tunnel and later a helicopter. At the end of the day, whether you care about the characters or not is irrelevant because director Matt Reeves and exec producer JJ Abrams don't care whether you do or not. Each is expendable, however painstakingly they are established and it's this anti-Hollywood, anti-clich√© attitude towards a very Hollywood idea that gives Cloverfield it's uniqueness and entertainment value. If all this seems like tosh to you, that's all very well, we can't agree on everything, but you can't deny that Cloverfield, if nothing else, is a fun night at the movies and isn't that what we missed in the summer of threequels?",7,0,2,24 February 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Visually and intellectually stimulating.
","Guillermo Del Toro's previous work was always a cut above and incredibly distinctive, so much that he could potentially become an adjective, although Tim Burtonesque is slightly easier to say than Guillermo Del Toroesque. From Cronos to The Devils Backbone to Blade 2 and more recently Hellboy, Del Toro has invited the viewer into his world of machinery and monsters. No more so than Pan's Labyrinth (more literally The Labyrinth of the Faun) in which he creates some of the most tantalisingly sumptuous images he's put to celluloid so far. In post Civil War Spain, 1944, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother Carmen go to live with her sadistic stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). While there she meets The Faun (Doug Jones) who tells her that she may be a lost Princess and she must complete several tasks in order to prove her identity. She agrees readily partly out of childish curiosity and partly to escape the horrors of her real world life.From the very first frame, this film grabs you. It's absorbing to the point of being glued to the screen despite several moments which may make you want to look away. The Pale man is one of the creepiest creature inventions of recent years and Del Toro's other monsters are so fully realised and imaginative that it's hard not to be awed. In a film like Blade 2, these creations are cool. In Pan's Labyrinth, they are strangely beautiful and arresting. The acting is superb all around, Sergi Lopez more evil and twisted than anything in Ofelia's world, bearing many similarities to Ralph Feinnes' Amon Goeth and Maribel Verdu, here playing a very different role to Luisa in Y tu mam√° tambi√©n is wonderfully understated until her final breaking point. Newcomer Ivana Baquero acts all the recent child actors off the screen in her quietly confident performance, slowly coming of age before our eyes. The greatest thing about the fantasy of this film is that nothing is explained, just as a fairy tale would be. The habit of needing to explain everything in Hollywood films kills the wonder of the fantasy and here, Del Toro simply presents everything as 'that's the way it is.' Why do I need to go and feed these stones to a toad in a tree? That's the way it is. In the same way, some of the extreme violence in the film is presented in a brutal, shocking way to convey more or less the same message. That's the way it is.There are parallels made between the real world and the fantasy world that are constantly revealing themselves throughout the film and almost act like easter eggs on subsequent viewings. This film was well thought through and carefully constructed and it shows through with all the details from the set designs, to the colour schemes to Guillermo Navarro's beautiful cinematography. The icing on the cake is the haunting score by Javier Navarette, guaranteed to have you humming it well after the credits roll. As far as the ending, Del Toro explains it as he sees it in interviews, but the great thing about a fairy tale is that it's whatever you want it to be and that's a rich film experience. Pan's Labyrinth is a dazzling, mesmerising piece of work that will become something of a classic in the future.",9,5,10,24 December 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Wonderfully twisted macabre musical from a visionary.
","Mixing the lyrical and musical talents of Steven Sondheim and the twisted macabre of Tim Burton, Sweeney Todd is a unique beast, not neatly fitting into any one genre and therefore struggling to find it's audience in a world of viewers who seem to take their musicals and splatter-fests mutually exclusively. But Sweeney Todd is so much more than either of those two things and each serves the other to tell a rich, funny, tragic and visually wonderful story about love loss and revenge.From the very first ominous note, we're in for a Gothic treat, the wonderful CG title sequence acting as visual overture to the musical one playing over it. We are introduced to Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), a barber whose life is stolen from him by the villainous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Reminiscent of the path taken by The Count of Monte Cristo's Edmond Dantes but far less honourable, Barker returns under the name Sweeney Todd and vows revenge on those responsible.The slightly jarring first songs can take a few minutes to adjust to for newbies, amidst the quintessentially Tim Burton looking design, but once the story's background is established and Johnny Depp's duet with Helena Bonham Carter, My Friends, begins, it is clear that the marriage of Sondheim's genius and Burton's twisted sensibility is a sound one. The lightning fast lyrics hold more cleverness in subsequent viewings and the musical nuances become more and more apparent with multiple listens. Burton draws on his influences, the washed out treatment of the picture evoking an almost black and white feel (although in colour) comprising of a blues, greys and golds with the occasional burst of vibrant colour in the dream/flashback sequences for punctuation. This is nothing new, Burton having used a similar palette for Sleepy Hollow, but just as it fit then, so too does it seem like Sondheim's Todd was meant to be lensed in that way. The character design further services Burton's filmic obsessions. The wild hair, pale skin and sunken eyes recall old horror films like The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari and Bride of Frankenstein.The standouts among the cast, ironically, are not the certified singers. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen and Alan Rickman all give superbly shaded performances heightened by their surprising vocal talents, while Burton sprays blood everywhere as a metaphorical emotional release for Todd's ailing psychopath. The final reel is a juggernaut of tragic happenstance, with a gut wrenching final shot that makes you realise that you care for these flawed nutcases more than you'd care to admit.In short, Sweeney Todd is a wonderful adaptation. Those coming from experience with the show will adore it and it will gain more fans who haven't seen the show as it becomes the cult film it's destined to be.",8,0,1,24 February 2008
American Beauty," Breathtaking and near flawless Steinbeckesque dramedy.
","I view the characters in this film much as I view the characters in John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men'. Each character in the book has their dreams, their goals, whether simple or fancy, they are dreams and most of them know deep down that they will never get there, but in order to lift themselves from the reality they are in, they need something to look forward to. In each character is a desire to be somewhere else, and in each character there is a major flaw, a weakness. In creating characters like these, Steinbeck has given each character redeeming features in such a way, that however hard you try, you cannot pick out a villain. Each and every character is a 'good guy', but each has their flaws that lead them to tragedy, and that is an excellent dynamic. In American Beauty, Lester, Janie, Angela, Carolyn, Ricky and Frank are all made out to be bad guys in some way or other, but each have their dreams, each have their flaws and they are all led to tragedy in one way or another because of them. Oh, and each are 'ordinary'. Its this Characterisation that really makes the film, aside from the cracking cinematography, acting, direction and ball-busting script. I would be very surprised if Alan Ball's inspiration was not partly because of Steinbeck. As you can see, I love this film.",9,4,7,16 February 2004
Ratatouille," A Rat's Life
","First there were toys. Then there were bugs. Then there were one eyed green things with Billy Crystal's voice. Then there were automobiles. Pixar has asked us many favours over the years and we have all happily, gladly and willingly obliged. Empathise with the things in this world least likely to be empathised with. Inanimate objects. Insects. Now - rodents. Pixar have succeeded in everything so far, but rats must always have been tricky. Specifically, we're talking semi-real world rats, in a semi-real world setting. In this case, a kitchen.It is a testament to Pixar's genius that I even mention having a problem with this. Most of the little animated cuties in films like Basil the Great Mouse Detective or The Rescuers etc are set apart from all other vermin by being distinctly cuddly and humanoid. Basil, for one, was Sherlock Holmes, wearing human clothes and adapting the rodent underworld into a human-like environment. But in this case, we're dealing with Brad Bird, director of The Incredibles, who gives us little gems of nuance to give his animated reality an identifiable sheen. The Incredibles, for example, is as preposterous as Sky High, yet includes such themes as bored in the office, family troubles and the like. His storytelling is unique and the animated world is so very layered that it is lifted high above some of the child fodder put out by Fox animation and, ahem, IDT Entertainment. It is this that gives Ratatouille some of it's magic.Yes, these rats talk, but only to each other. All human ears can hear is squeaking. But really, this movie does not delude itself or it's audience. These are cute and cuddly rats, but nevertheless, rats in the kitchen are disgusting. So, once you get past that aspect, you can begin to invest. The plot involves a rat named Remy who loves good food and likes to experiment with cooking. A chance meeting with a young man named Linguini in a restaurant kitchen causes them to team up and begin cooking together, garnering acclaim. I won't tell anymore than that because it's much more fun to find out for yourself.The film's voice talents are spot on. The trick here is that no-one is particularly recognisable (aside from Peter O'Toole who is absolutely marvellous as usual). In animated films such as Shark Tale, the focus is taken off the story in favour of showcasing Jack Black! Will Smith! Angelina Jolie! much to the detriment of the final product (the excessive pop culture referencing is enough already as well). In this movie, the story is it's own boss, even going so far as to continue to be real-world even in light of certain ridiculous developments (which are a lot of fun, just ridiculous!). There is slightly less laughter than one might expect, but it's not really noticeable as everything else is so absorbing. The existing one liners however never miss ('we don't mean to be rude, but we're French!'). The animation, shown up wonderfully on the crisp, clear DVD (that's normal DVD, HD can kiss my butt) is perfect, showing Shrek the Third up easily. So, my only comment would be the slow start. Normally these movies get better when I watch them again, so maybe opinion will change. Until then, any further analysing would be overkill. It's a cartoon after all, and a damn entertaining one at that. Now, who's hungry?",8,1,3,6 December 2007
Quantum of Solace," Excellent Bond. Just pay attention...
","For the second time since Daniel Craig took the mantle of agent 007, Eon productions has once again delivered us a true spy thriller as opposed to overblown fantasy movies that were declining once again into self parody. There's nothing wrong with a good romp. In fact, Die Another Day, with all it's faults and awful innuendo, is still an entertaining Bond adventure. Now, however, Bond needs to be something more to survive in a world where franchises that have gone back to their source materials are enjoying more critical and financial success than ever before. Bond needed to go home, back to Fleming, creator of a hard drinking, womanising, cold blooded assassin who cares for no one, trusts no one and is devoted to Queen and country. A man who has more depth to him than 60% of the films would have you believe. A true, unashamed bastard.The result is a gadget and catchphrase free Bond film that doesn't spoon feed it's audience with exposition. It manages to still feel like a Bond film without whacking you over the head with the Bond theme (although it is there) and having him introduce himself every few minutes to remind you. No, there is no Q. No, there is no Moneypenny. Are they necessary in this story? No. They would simply be there as a box to tick off which the writers and director have smartly side stepped this time around in favour of a lean thriller with a purpose.After the events of Casino Royale, Bond is now on the tail of anyone connected to the mysterious and dangerous organisation behind the events of Casino Royale, which culminated in the death of Vesper, the woman he loved. In the process he stumbles upon Dominic Greene, a tycoon who plans to monopolise Bolivia's water supply and hold it to ransom, but first he must topple the current regime so that he can do business with the corrupt General who is positioned to inherit the land.Along the way, Bond meets Camille, a Bolivian agent who also has a score to settle. Amidst the usual fist fights and explosions, there are some great character moments and resolutions to the loose ends of Casino Royale. Some complain about an over complex plot, but the trick is to pay attention and listen to the dialogue (a tall order for some it seems). Judi Dench plays a larger role here as M, fleshing out her relationship with Bond further. Her outward distrust and frustration with Bond belies her inner faith in him and we begin to notice that she may know him better than he knows himself.The finale is a spectacle, of course. A hotel in the middle of the desert built on unstable hydrogen fuel cells is pure Bond. Ironically the same critics complaining about Quantum being too serious have a problem with this. The only thing that really and truly looks out of place here is Craig's bomber jacket.The final scene caps off this two parter, with a cryptic yet poignant exchange of dialogue that moulds Bond into an island, finally. Craig's performance is pitch perfect here. He balances the hard exterior with the pain of loss inside without under or overplaying it. He is simply Bond. This scene is followed by what most believe to be one of the big no-nos of the film: The iconic gunbarell sequence. This could not be further from the truth. If Bond got his theme at the end of Casino Royale, he's certainly earned his gunbarrel here, signifying the completion of the character into someone more familiar. Let's hope he can still continue to develop in subsequent entries.This is more in depth than anyone has any right to expect from a Bond film and hopefully this sets the bar. Maybe Craig will give us a few more 'spy thrillers' before the inevitable relapse into self parody begins again. For now though, a good script, pro acting, some blistering action and some fantastic Bond development round out a satisfying conclusion to Casino Royale. Comparisons with it's predecessor are inevitable, but despite being a sequel of sorts, Quantum continues the story while managing to be wildly different, as every new Bond entry should be. This film has had a mixed reception so far, but as a Bond fan (since age 5) I'm entirely satisfied and excited to see where they will take him.(Please refer to the 'Help' section for information on how to vote on comments. Disagreement is inevitable with a film that has split this many people down the middle. That's not what you're voting on!)",8,2,7,28 April 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A sequel easily dismissed, but worth reevaluation.
","Nine times out of ten, a bad Spielberg film is usually better than most. This film has a bad reputation and is usually dismissed as a less than perfect sequel, but it deserves another look, if only to show how good it really is. Sure, there are plot holes and some bad choices, but those shouldn't tarnish the overall film.So what's the good? The dialogue for one thing is well written and well delivered. Early exchanges between field equipment expert Eddie and lead Ian Malcolm are snappy and amusing ('violence and technology - not good bedfellows!' 'I would have squeezed a little tighter...'), while Pete Postlethwaite's character is magnificently arrogant and snide. Even Vince Vaughan, deprived of his usual schtick, is not given short thrift. Part of Spielberg's genius is his eye for situational character beats and his way of dealing with actors. If you notice, almost none of his films short change the characters. Hook, for example, is strongest in it's first half hour, in which we witness Banning's family problems and inability to let go of his work. Notice also Poltergeist. If anyone had any doubts as to the answer to the question of who really directed that film, compare the family scenes with Close Encounters or Jaws. Here too, Spielberg shoe horns in those moments.Aside from the actors, the dinos are still breathtaking four years on. Why are these creatures so awesome and more recent CGI (including Spielberg's own War of the Worlds and Indy 4) are so underwhelming? The action sequences still have the punch of the original: Sarah Harding desperately trying not to move on the cracking glass that is the only thing between her and the abyss below. The velociraptor attack. The T-Rex sniffing out our heroes behind a waterfall. All wonderfully crafted sequences. Now have a look at Jurassic Park 3 and see the difference. An entertaining film, sure, but lacking the sheen and quality of a Spielberg film.While the missing Raptor sequence that explains the deaths on the boat near the end provides the film's biggest plot hole and the King Kong homage is a little too much, the film still doesn't lose it's sense of excitement and fun, driving it to a rousing finale.Like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (which is much maligned, but I think it's the second best of the series) The Lost World is frequently dismissed, but to my mind worthy of another go.",7,0,1,2 April 2009
Pride & Prejudice," A stunning film, even if you only read the book in school.
","I was fortunate enough to attend a gala screening of this film at the British Film Festival here in Israel tonight. I don't generally watch period films of this kind and I thought it would be interesting to try something different for a change, Keira Knighley's presence notwithstanding of course! I have heard many disgruntled fans of Jane Austen's book complain that this film did not do it justice or that it didn't measure up to the 1995 mini series with Colin Firth. If so, I suggest you either read the book again or watch the mini series again because when something is made into a film, it is what it is, otherwise you get the blandness of what was the first Harry Potter. A direct translation. The film is to be shortened and altered to fit whatever vision the writer or director may have, otherwise it is simply what has gone before and what would be the point? Anyway, to the film. I must admit, though I was familiar with the story, modern times have caused me to look at it differently now, drawing more comparisons with Bridget Jones than it's former incarnations or it's source text. I apologise if that seems sacrilegious. However, as a non fan of this genre, I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals are beautifully artistic, the acting superb (and these lines are not easy to give over as naturally and convincingly as they are here) and the script is sharp. I was drawn yet again into this story, which has never looked so rich in my opinion and despite a few scenes that could have been trimmed down for meandering a little, it moved at an acceptable pace. Knightley embodies pure Jane Austen strength while keeping it believable for the period, giving a solid performance and a few Americans turn up with nicely polished accents to add a little spice to the cast. Donald Sutherland for example, in a gentle turn as Mr. Bennett and Jena Malone from Donnie Darko as Lydia. The always wonderful Judi Dench (Lady Catherine) turns up giving us one of the most powerful dialogue scenes of the film, is the icing on the cake. Rosamunde Pike is beautiful and she underplays her character, without bursting into over the top fits of tears and whining as would have been possible. Having said that, she still has too little to do.Of course, Matthew Macfadyen is not Colin Firth and I'm sure he apologises to everyone for committing this hideous crime, however, he does play Mr Darcy and not Colin Firth, so I assume he can be forgiven. Tom Hollander (I know him as Daniel of Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Lawrence) is toe curlingly 'ridiculous' as Elizabeth puts it, in his role as Mr. Collins.I shouldn't think English Lit students would do necessarily well to ditch the book in favour of the film, but I do think this film is a good representation of it's source material and deserves credit where credit is due.

Love Actually," How Richard could have made a Bucketful...
","This film was 2 hours and 9 minutes long. There were eight (count 'em!) different love stories to follow. In some films, there are four stories to follow, and they all come together rather neatly packaged in the end. See Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Go etc. In a romantic comedy, more than one love story can be an interesting idea, if pulled off correctly. Otherwise it can just be vomit-inducing fluff. There were some great ideas here, great comic set pieces, an underused Rowan Atkinson and a helluvalotta stars from British TV (Teachers, anyone?) and film. The theme of the film is, of course, love is all around. I myself certainly felt like every female I saw after the film was a potential mate. This film will do that to you.It's a good idea, in the long run, but, as a writer, this is what I would have done: With a Niagara Falls sized stream of ideas flowing out of my head, such as these, I would have made 3, 4 or 5 different films out of this. Curtis could have easily done that and made a packet load out of it. Of course it defeats the idea of mass story lines and mass stars, but for a directorial debut, Curtis seems too eager to please. And why? After Notting Hill, Four Weddings, penning Bridget Jones 1 (and 2!) this would have been a sure thing for him however he played it.Each story strand is a work of well-crafted fiction, each character more or less three dimensional, even though a few story strands have split ends (in layman's terms, they don't work and they don't end.)One major problem is that he doesn't stick with certain story lines long enough for them to develop, and some just develop too quickly and are quickly thrown away. Oh well. Still a good film, but I would feel more comfortable watching it on DVD in instalments rather than sitting through 2 hours and 9 minutes of waiting for this to end. So all in all, a good first effort, if a little cheesy. One more thing though; the sombre sad part of a romantic comedy comes in around about the mid to last quarter of the film, where the two leads argue about something or other, making the final payoff a more desperate sight for the viewer. However, with eight couples going through angst, a rather sombre mid section drags into a soggy, bittersweet tear-fest and doesn't churn out many laughs. A shame, but worth watching for the sheer spectacle of the ensemble cast.",Null,8,21,7 January 2004
The Green Mile," Magnificent.
","People have been urging me to see this film for a long time. This film left me absolutely flabbergasted and completely inspired. I have no shame in admitting that I blubbed a bit, and, coming from the most cynical critic when it comes to tearjerkers, that's gotta make a good movie.Tom Hanks is wonderful. He inhabits the part fully and unselfishly, playing off Michael Clarke Duncan who in turn plays off Hanks. They steal every scene they're in and when they're together, pow. The characters seem to be very much akin to the characters of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men (I have mentioned this before in a review of American Beauty). Each is flawed but not all bad, or good but not all good. These characters can invoke both sympathy and hatred in the same damn scene and their actors do them credit.I'm not surprised that both Darabont and King have come out with yet another winner. I hope they team up again.I have given this movie a ten, simply because never have I been so emotionally taken with a film and I'm worried that the next film I see will disappoint me because of it. The Green Mile is one to be remembered.",10,1,3,2 January 2005
The Terminal," Fun, warm and engaging with Spielberg written all over it.
","Inspired in part by a true event, The Terminal tells the story of Viktor Navorksi (Tom Hanks), a native of the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia, who flies to New York to keep a promise to his father. While Viktor's plane is in the air, there is a military coup, rendering his native country unrecognised and rendering Viktor with an invalid passport and no where else to go. In short, he is unacceptable. Unable to leave the JFK transit lounge or to fly home, Viktor settles in the airport and begins to find new ways to make money, amuse himself and make friends while learning English. In the process he meets Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a troubled flight attendant whose relationship with a married man is beginning to take it's toll. She finds solace in Viktor's friendship, and Viktor develops that inevitable crush...First of all, the obvious. Spielberg had production designer Alex McDowell build an entire terminal from scratch in an unused airplane hangar. The finished product is extremely impressive, even more so if you know that bit of trivia, so it should stand to reason that the star of the movie would be the set. Not so, as Spielberg proved with Jurassic Park, character and performance can work with technical brilliance rather than be outshone. The evidence of this is in Tom Hanks' mesmerising performance. Hanks infuses Victor with the same childlike wonder as that of his characters in Big and Forrest Gump. He loses himself in the role, from the accent right down to the walk and the blank expression, to the point where you can actually forget you're watching Tom Hanks. Although amusing early scenes have Viktor struggling with the language barrier, it's never at his expense. He's portrayed as a character with obstacles to get over and his resourcefulness in getting over them, never as an object of ridicule. In contrast, Catherine Zeta-Jones' character Amelia is not as likable as one would expect from a love interest, possibly because her character was not originally intended that way and during filming the chemistry between the two made it clear that the connection should be somewhat romantic. She isn't unnecessary, but she does give the impression that she is there solely to develop Viktor himself.However, the other supporting players, Enrique (Diego Luna of Y Tu Mama Tambien), Gupta (Kumar Pallana) and Mulroy (Chi McBride) as airport employees never fall into the trap of 'annoying comedic padding' and are always amiable, funny and touching when they need to be. This motley crew formed a friendship during filming and it radiates off the screen. The role of workaholic immigration officer Frank Dixon is realised wonderfully in the hands of character actor Stanley Tucci. A flawed and complex creation, Dixon serves as the antagonist of the piece, trying desperately to get a promotion while trying to get Viktor out of his terminal so that he can be someone else's problem. Like Hanks' Carl Hanratty of Catch Me If You Can, it's difficult to label Dixon a bad guy. He's just doing his job, heartlessly and efficiently but is visibly conflicted about what he has to do, following the rulebook stubbornly and ruthlessly. The humanity that Tucci brings to the role elevates him beyond the usual moustache twirling villain.On the directing side, Spielberg fills each of his frames with goodies. He has an entire airport set to play with and he uses every inch of it with a boyish delight. Despite the enormity of the set, it would still have been easy for it to become claustrophobic, but there's always something pretty to gawk at, Spielberg achieving the seemingly impossible task of making you want to live in an airport terminal. Spielberg has deliberately shied away from all out comedies since his flop '1941', but this movie's comedic element shows that he's gotten over that, flitting effortlessly between action blockbusters, sci-fi and serious historical movies. The only drawback is the overt sentimentality that dominates the last third of the movie. Some would say that this movie earns it's right to be sentimental, but it becomes a tad uncomfortable. Spielberg has been unfairly labelled as a sentimental director, due no doubt to films such as ET, Always and AI, but these people fail to realise that most of his films, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Jaws, Duel and Minority Report to name a few are at their core dark and disturbing in places, so Spielberg earns his right to lash on the weepies once in a while.Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's lighting and use of colour is always magnificent, but here he fills each shot with wonderfully rich golds and blues and his style, which has always complemented Spielberg's sleight of hand direction, has never been more suited to his director. The main feat achieved here is the use of artificial light doubling as daylight, something which the average film-goer won't notice, but without it, the illusion of the set would have failed.John Williams' music is from the same ilk as his Catch Me score. Viktor's theme is an eastern European influenced riff in the form of a mischievous clarinet at the forefront which is instantly memorable and is the kind of theme that'll play a loop in your head for hours afterwards. It adds a further lightness to the film which in turn adds considerably to the overall feel good factor of a film already warming the cockles.THE BOTTOM LINE: Spielberg has created another 'dessert' of a movie, which occasionally gets a little too sweet and sickly for it's own good, but is engaging enough that it always ensures you'll want to come back for that second helping.",7,2,4,28 April 2009
Casino Royale," Electrifying comeback for the man in the tux.
","After the disappointing Die Another Day, producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson needed a change, and in the midst of all the newly found gritty realism in the spy movie genre, it couldn't have come at a better time. Surviving the press and internet critiques of a film not yet even finished shooting, both producers, director and their put upon lead star were spurred on to bring out the very best product they possibly could. The result is Casino Royale, a stylish, glossy, sophisticated and at times brutal Bond movie.When reviewing a Bond movie, three things have to be taken into account. 1) It was not made to win awards, 2) It is highly likely that if you saw the last one, this one will bear more than a passing resemblance to it, and 3) If you're a die hard Bond fan, you're probably going to love or like it no matter what. It's something to do with the swell of the music, the shaking and not stirring of a vodka martini and that bloke introducing himself again. After each film began coming out cloning it's predecessor and, more recently, a spill over into 'xXx' territory (with more cheesy one liners than you can fit in the boot of an Aston Martin) it was understandable that Bond fans would start to become restless.So when it was announced that Bond was going back to the beginning, taking a leaf from Batman Begins, naturally the Bond fans rioted, because you just can't please some people. Next, they find out that the new Bond of the noughties was going to be a short fellow with a shock of blonde hair. How outrageous. The performance, however, speaks for itself.Going back to the source material, Bond is now what he should be; a cold, calculating, womanising bastard with a taste for anything over 40% proof and a thirst for the kill. Craig's performance is damn near perfect, giving Bourne a run for his money in the hard-arse department. Suddenly, post Brosnan, Bond is now apart of the 'who would win in a fight?' game once again.Almost every risk taken with this film works wonderfully. We first meet Bond in black and white before securing his licence to kill, in fact, while securing his licence to kill. The unconventional gunbarrel sequence that follows integrates the familiar staple into the story. Next we follow Bond on his first mission, making sloppy mistakes, annoying his boss 'M' (the always amazing Judi Dench), gambling and hooking up with married women, all the while leaving a trail of dead bodies behind him. His mission takes him to Montenegro, where Le Chiffre, a banker with terrorist affiliations, is trying to win back the money he lost in a bad stocks call by setting up a poker game at the Casino Royale. Bond is slipped in to play Le Chiffre and win the money himself, with the buy in provided by the treasury represented by the beautiful Vesper Lynd played by the alluring Eva Green.The film very closely follows the book in it's plot beats, changing necessary details to fill in time, action set pieces and to update to 2006. Now Bond is human, he has emotion, he feels remorse, he makes mistakes, and it helps to have a main character whom you not only secretly aspire to be, but whom you can actually invest in. There's very little wrong with this film, except perhaps a slightly uninspiring climactic set piece which is more or less for the sake of it and a few snippets of corny dialogue. The poker game that dominates the mid section is nail bitingly intense, whether you play the game or not, and the dialogue benefits from a polish by Crash scribe Paul Haggis.The music is by far David Arnold's best James Bond score, with certain measures sounding like they were taken straight from John Barry. The main theme itself, You Know My Name, resonates throughout the entire film, standing in for the Bond theme which doesn't make an appearance in it's full glory until the end. The fact that it's not jarring to be without the Bond theme in a Bond film is a testament to Arnold's achievement.The best thing about this movie is that it's follow ups should all be in the same vein, giving an air of 'I want to see what he'll do next' rather than 'oh, and this where he uses the gadget we saw at the beginning...' I hope all the naysayers are feeling, to put it in the words of Rowan Atkinson, like a right bunch of nitwits.THE BOTTOM LINE: Casino Royale emerges from it's pre-release tabloid bashing as probably the best Bond film since Connery's hairpiece started going grey. Craig is certainly one of the closest to the Fleming vision and does cool and vulnerable at the same time, while the movie itself manages to become a Bond film that can actually have some surprises in store for it's audience.",9,1,3,28 April 2009
The Island," Bay tries to do Kubrick and ends up doing Bay. Were we expecting something else?
","This movie looks like a recipe. You take one helping of Logan's run, mix it with a little Equilibrium, rip two measures off the Matrix and borrow some images of the future that look like I, Robot (which in itself looked like something else.) When you mix all these ingredients together, you have the Island, part human, part machine. The first half is the human part.We see the world through the questioning eyes of Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), inhabitant of a Big Brother style world of forced tranquillity. We feel his annoyance at things like restriction of Alcohol, meat bans due to forced health regimes, even restrictions in clothing. We discover the secrets of the world around him as he does. We know that the sinister Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) knows more than he lets on. In short, we, the audience, are mildly intrigued. Yes, this looks like something I've seen before after the many Philip K Dick adaptations of the post Wachowski era, but we'll give it a chance. Maybe this will go in a different direction, maybe Michael Bay's breakaway from Jerry Bruckheimer was just what he needed.So, Lincoln Six Echo uncovers the secrets of the world he has been placed in, that there is no 'Island' where all the inhabitants are promised they will end up by way of winning a lottery, and that each person sent to the Island ends up dead. Six Echo escapes with lady friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlet Johanssen) to the outside world where Dr. Merrick and his cronies give chase. It's here that the film turns to machine. I won't reveal any more plot even though you'll guess it from this point in the film anyway. It's as if writer Caspian Tredwell-Owen (who sounds like a character in the movie) gave up on his original idea halfway through and just said 'Sod it, lets just make it predictable Hollywood fare.' We know what Michael Bay's movies are like. This was marketed as a departure for Bay, new and interesting, but audience members must feel cheated now. This is a by the numbers Bay action movie. The characters are Threadbare, the script is stilted. In the second half there must have been pages and pages of dialogue that simply read 'Hold on!' 'Look out!' and 'Aaaaargh!' The action sequences look like the leftovers from Bad Boys 2 and the excellent freeway chase. The movie is far too glossy for it's gloomy subject matter and would have been better served as the mood piece it was marketed as. It also thinks it's so clever it comes out looking dumb and predictable. I give this movie 3 stars because the first 40 minutes intrigued me and Steve Buscemi provided comic relief in a fun cameo. The rest had me looking at my watch and actually begging for it to finish. I like Michael Bay movies in general, but this one tried to convince me it was something else, and it didn't work even a little bit.",3,2,4,17 September 2005
