Blade Runner 2049," Very well done sirs and madams!
","I'm not going to go massively stupid and give it a ten.
The way you've fletted the old with the new is impressive.
I only write in paragraphs :)
It is way too long but luckily old people like me can take naps and only wake up when action occurs.
Liked the replicant ninja bird, she's great.
Shame she had to die.
Always like new ideas in science fiction and I'm looking forward to the holographic AI girlfriend meets prostitute, how much do you think a session will cost?
Bags to be the first one in a theater, in the desert scene where you see two massive naked female figures to shout out 'Booby trap!'
Who doesn't review movies without a thought of; 'is this a keeper' ?
This IS a keeper! I'm keeping it, it's kept, consider it kept, i'm keeping it, no, don't make me want to not keep it, i'm keeping it, it's kept, consider it so.",8,1,4,26 December 2017
