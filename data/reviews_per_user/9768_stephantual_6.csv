Source Code," Terrible? No. But there's plenty of other , better scifi to watch.
","I'm sorry but a quick look at the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival past 15 years give me 15 better options to watch than this , very commercial, very drab movie.Yes, they had the money, and it shows, but plot wise and execution wise the film miss most of the marks it sets for itself (and trust me that bar is low).Disappointing for someone who expected a highish budget time travel story.",4,0,2,5 May 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Mega budget fan lip service not amounting to anything concrete.
","From beginning to end this megabucks production serves only the purpose of displaying as many creatures from the potter series as possible in a standard runtime.Plot wise it's as predictable as you'd expect from a children movie - this is a kids movie, right? - you can watch it with one eye open and still get terribly bored.Of note: despite being its sole purpose, the cgi can be oh-hum at times, and several scenes are so badly lit that the green screens are obvious. In short , it even fails at what little expectations you may have of it.",1,0,0,2 July 2020
Climax," spoiler free review: it's one of Noe's best
","'Climax' continues the long tradition of Noe's highly praised , loved by critics cult films that lose tons of money at the box office regardless. It's a magistral tour de force where he was able to shoot and hour and half (great restraint there by the way) of communicating:1- raw humanity and what unites us despite our social divisions (and not in an annoying sjw way either)
2 - the effect of drugs on the human body and mind without at any point having an actor saying a single thing about what they saw or felt
3 - a story with a proper arc (which i know bothered many in 'love'.9/10 , i would say irreversible still his best , tied with i stand alone and enter the void - you can't go wrong.",9,1,2,6 June 2020
1917," Amazing technical feat ruined by major, pointless historical revisionism.
","1917 is visually and auditorily a masterpiece. Won 3 oscars 7 baftas, deservedly so. It's the movie that will makes you want a new sound system and a giant tv .BUTY the story is super simple, and it's highly, painfully historically inaccurate for the sake of pleasing 2020 audiences, sinning to the point of screaming 'revisionism'.Think indiana jones meets saving private ryan. I thought the end product was average because of these issues, but I think most people will rave about it because how technically impressive it is.",7,0,1,8 May 2020
There Will Be Blood," Perfect and some of the finest acting in recent history.
","This movie demonstrates it's possible to make a film that's not lynchesque and still hit high marks despite the 'regular' storytelling. Propulsed by Daniel Day-Lewis astounding performance, the movie never miss a beat and deliver on an epic the likes of which we haven't seen since early Scorcese. Mindblowing. A masterpiece. 10/10.",10,0,0,7 June 2020
Parasite," Overhyped. There's so much better social commentary coming out of other countries for obvious resasons.
","Spoiler free review: My family watches 75% Korean shows so I'm very familiar with what's on offer here. Is 'Parasites' head and shoulders above 99.99% of what the country produces? Yes. Does it have a cool twist? Meh, I saw it see more as a sudden a genre change well towards the end of the movie. Is it accessible to western audiences? Absolutely, but we'll never know if we missed anything from the original korean.But ultimatey it's a very light hearted comedy for 1h52 hours, followed by comedy horror for 5 minutes, and drama for 10.Expecting a deep social commentary from SK is like expecting a critique of the CCP coming out of China. At no point is the 'system' that created the situation depicted criticised in any meaningful manner. There was far more depth in 'the platform'.Enjoyed the goofy, light hearted laughs, the heartwarming , well depicted family interactions, and the dramatic bittersweet ending. 6/10",6,1,3,9 May 2020
