Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Terrific Theme Park Ride
","It still amazes me that all of this came out of a theme park ride. That said, the action should be like a roller coaster and this didn't not always happen in the first three films. In the words of Steve Urkle, fret not my pet. Such is not the case here.Johnny Depp finally displayed a sense of knowing he's a bada-- as Captain Jack Sparrow. He always came off a bit too aloof in the previous films, but here he is in fine form with attitude, swagger, and a glint in his eye that belies his tomfoolery. He knows what he's doing even when it doesn't look like he knows what he's doing, and he knows it.Penelope Cruz has rarely shown me anything interesting, even in her serious roles. She has a few pouty scenes here, but action seems to suit her well. There is nothing she does that strikes me as fake or hard to believe. I can be sucked into this world and believe for two hours she is the character doing all of these things, not an actor who gets replaced by a stunt-woman from time to time. She's charming, deadly, and then charming again. A true daughter of Blackbeard and worthy adversary for our beloved captain.Geoffrey Rush is always awesome. If he did it, he's good. 'Nuff said.Ian McShane is getting some bad raps. Apparently some people don't find him mean enough or evil enough. Perhaps they want a drunk man stumbling around firing a gun in randoms directions. What they have missed is the perfectly understated, confident captain of all that is evil. Not only does McShane nail Blackbeard, he comes across so disarming that by the time you realize how evil he is and that you are about to die it is too late. Undoubtedly the performance of the movie. He rarely loses his temper, always thinks of himself first, and is in complete control of the situation at all times. Oh yeah, and don't look at him cross-eyed or he'll kill you. Perfect.The story itself is exactly what you want from a summer blockbuster. It is a great popcorn flick with some meaningful moments and dialog mixed in for those who actually pay attention to words in a swashbuckling film. There is a clear first act, second act, and third act, and they progress in a linear path that leads to X rather than a dramedic complicating action, reaction to complicating action, and resolution of complicating action. The only drawback, and thus the reason for 8 stars instead of 10, is the presence of some stunts that are outside the realm of human, rational possibility. Kind of like Indian Jones and the Refirigerator of Steel. Well, anything in that Indy flick, actually. That said, for the most part it is wonderfully free of CGI and filled with lush scenery and an amazing take on the beauty of mermaids. Rob Marshall does not disappoint.There are some difficult scenes for children in this one. Make sure you see it first before letting your pre-teens take in some of this violent death and destruction.I believe this film will satisfy your taste-buds as you wait for the progression of the summer blockbusters of Transformers, some dude named Harry, and that guy with the bullseye on his shield.",8,2,4,20 May 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Not what you might expect
","On the surface that trailers supply for us, this film looks like a run-of-the-mill How Cal Got His Groove Back. We follow Carell's character (Cal) after his wife, Emily (played by Julianne Moore) blurt's out over dinner that she wants a divorce. It's not a stunning hook, since we kind of already knew it was going to happen from the trailer, but it works well. In a Rom-Com, that's basically what you are looking for. New ways to freshen up a clich√©, or fresh takes on familiar situations. Crazy, Stupid, Love essentially lives in the latter as we find Cal as the perfect dad who's only real sin here is that he is content with his life and family, and it is the wife who gets cast in the shallow role.Simultaneously, we get the story of young Hannah (Emma Stone). She's an aspiring attorney who is about to take the BAR exam and really hoping that clean cut, gosh-golly-shucks Richard (Josh Groban) will ask her to marry him. If you want foreign, here it is. The sexy, brilliant girl wants Ned Flanders instead of smoking hot Jacob (Ryan Gosling). Totally a dude crush here. He's cut, he's not a high school football player who loves country music, and he's definitely not hanging around some lady with Alzheimer's. He's the ladies man who considers himself a gentleman because he knows how to get her home, and get her to want him so much she basically begs for it.On the outskirts, a puppy love story between Robbie and Jessica. Well, sort of. Robbie is Cal's son and Jessica is his babysitter. Hilarity and awkwardness ensues. Honestly, this is one of the greatest treats of the film as Robbie (Jonah Bobo) carries the scenes between he and his dad, and there is palpable tension between Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) and Cal's ex, Emily (Moore), as Jess has the requisite crush on the dad, and thinks Emily is crazy for leaving him.That is your basic set-up. The comedy style is little bit Carell, and little bit Americanized-British humor (awkward situations and social faux paux). The main reason I didn't give the movie 9or ten stars is because we have rich characters to play with and they barely scratch the surface. We get an 80s montage of verbage from Jacob to explain why he hunts women the way he does, an unexplained purpose for the mentorship of Jacob toward Cal (other than some character development for Jacob), and some mind-blowing insight from a junior high student (Bobo) that we have no idea where he picked it up. The main point is to say, if you like Carell, you'll like the movie. If you like romantic-comedies, this one will twist you up and leave you delighted. If you are a fan of things like love and marriage, this film will remind you of some reasons you think people are crazy for not getting married and taking a chance that this person might just be your soul mate. The characters are crazy, they do some stupid things, and, for better or worse, it is all for the glory of love.",8,1,2,28 August 2011
