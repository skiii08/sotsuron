E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A true gem of a film from a bygone era of film-making...
","This is one of the most truly incredible, fantastic, heartwarming and heart-wrenching films of all time. It is the story of a little alien botanist left behind, alone on Earth until he is befriended by Elliot and his family. The film is such a heartwarming experience that almost no words can describe how it makes me feel. I hadn't seen the film in probably 20 years until tonight and everything, including the tears, came flooding back. Even thinking about it while I write this review, I still get a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. As one reviewer has said, I will never truly grow up. I find my cynical outlook on life shattered by watching this film again. It is that much of a wonderful experience. Life-altering is one term I'd use to describe this beautiful movie, as it touches on so many things that make you want to be a kid again. If anything should be shown and broadcast into outer space, this should be the film. They never did, and never will make anything like this again. This was a once in a lifetime experience. The late 1970's and into the 1980's were filled to the brim with wonderful films for all ages such as (of course) E.T., Tron, Supergirl, the Star Trek films, Masters of the Universe, the Star Wars saga, The Monster Squad, The Last Starfighter, Explorers, the Goonies, the Indiana Jones series....so many incredible films that will fill your heart with love, adventure, adoration and the longing to experience your childhood again. Watch this film and realize all over again why this is the greatest movie ever made. I guarantee you'll be crying tears of joy as well as sadness by film's end and be left with that feeling that you've seen something so absolutely wonderful, that it only reaffirms that belief that no matter what happens, no one can ever take away the fond memories of childhood.",10,0,1,3 July 2008
