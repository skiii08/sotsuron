The Blair Witch Project," 'Damnfool kids'll never learn...'
","I love this movie. I saw it in a very dark theatre,and it scared me to death.To me,the story is about three people who don't belong in thewoods,and suffer the consequences. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT works on the viewer at a psychological level,like all great horror films do.",Null,0,1,11 July 2002
Beauty and the Beast," Time for an eye roll
","'Animations oftentimes reinforces stereotypes, and the `happily ever after' genre conflicts with any real independence Belle could have shown, resulting in no choice other than marriage.' Oh,get your head out of your ass,Lindsey.",10,0,0,6 April 2002
Beauty and the Beast," A Cinematic Masterpiece
","BEAUTY AND THE BEAST opened my mind to the world of film. It is a treasure for the eyes as well as the mind,an intelligent, transcendent movie that features a timeless and affecting love story between two very likeable people,and the ones who care about them. These people are complex,a true rarity in animated films(and most live-action movies.) There is also an element of eroticism in this film,a chemistry more sexual than any live actors could ever portray.BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is one of the greatest films ever made.",10,0,0,25 October 2001
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Pure pain
","Watching this movie was like stepping into a parallel universe,because the characters in this movie were not regular human beings. They wereshallow beyond belief,much like the rest of this movie,which is also far too long. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen,and I've seen some really bad movies...",Null,4,10,31 October 2003
The Terminator," A classic
","THE TERMINATOR is an excellent movie, a true science fiction classic. James Cameron really captures the grimy underside of Los Angeles. The characters are vivid and sympathetic and Arnold Schwarzenegger is the only guy who could have played the Terminator. I've heard complaintsabout how violent this movie is,and there are violent scenes,but there's also a compelling plot.",Null,0,1,6 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," So bad it's good
","ATTACK OF THE CLONES was so bad it was BRILLIANT. The cast looked as if they had tried to make sense of the script and failed. The script is absolutely awful,but the CGI is great and the action sequences areexciting. Yoda's lightsaber duel with Christopher Lee completely made up for the lame script.",Null,2,4,14 June 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Wondrous
","For every kid who ever thought there was a monster hiding in their closet comes vindication in MONSTERS,INC, a wonderfully funny and imaginative film filled with incredible visuals and surreal surprises.",Null,0,3,11 September 2003
Lilo & Stitch," My problem with this film began with the trailers
","I was very much offended by the LILO AND STITCH trailers featuring the characters from BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,which is my favorite film. The trailer is canonically illogical and shows a complete lack of respect on the part of the filmmakers. All the trailers with characters that came before LILO AND STITCH were meaningless-they turned Jasmine into a slut,but it didn't work because the rest of the magic carpet rideHAPPENED in ALADDIN. If that was the way the movie went,it would make sense,but the cold hard fact is that it didn't. The BATB chandelier stayed right where it was in the REAL movie. These are the facts of the fiction. Trying to alter them is dishonest-in fact,it's cinematic rape. You cannot destroy classic cinema like BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-it is immortal. They danced. I know what I saw. I think I'm forgetting something. Oh,the movie. What about it? I'd rather jump out of a plane without a parachute than see LILO AND STITCH.",1,1,27,24 June 2002
Dark City," DARK CITY = great filmmaking
","In DARK CITY,no one is who they seem to be. It's science fiction with a healthy dose of shadowy film noir thrown in; it is a movie aboutdrifting smoke,funereal clothes,unyielding stone and everlasting night. It asks the question 'Do our memories make us who we are?' and toys with it as the film progresses. The entire film is brilliant-it engages the viewer's imagination without being insulting. The acting is wonderful and Alex Proyas's direction performs miracles right before your eyes. A new classic.",Null,0,2,5 June 2002
Event Horizon," A great movie that also sucks horribly
","EVENT HORIZON is a damned scary movie,with characters for whom you can root. There's plenty of imaginative gore and atmosphere,but there are moments that drag this movie down; the characters begin acting like complete idiots and the movie begins to borrow from other movies(stick pins in Sam Neill's head at the end and you get Pinhead minus the white makeup) I like this movie a lot,though. Definitely worth your time.",Null,0,1,8 June 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," Be warned
","I have seen this film cause a roomful of college students to cry their eyes out. Unrelentingly sad,this film is a tragic parade,the theme being the horrors of war. I made it through without crying at all. I don't know how I did it. Regarded by some as the saddest movie ever made.",Null,1,2,4 January 2002
Groundhog Day," Hilarious
","GROUNDHOG DAY is a rare film: it is a gut-busting comedy as well asa dark philosophical nightmare. Bill Murray makes Phil a real person, and the writing is absolutely excellent. The people who made GROUNDHOG DAY had much more on their minds than just comedy; they delivered an intellectual,witty treatise on the nature of existence.",Null,0,0,2 September 2002
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," I was neither shocked nor disturbed
","I expected this movie to be utterly disgusting,disturbing and vile but it was pretentious crap. You'd think a movie about naked teenagers being forced to eat their own feces would at least be interesting. The fecal matter's not even real.",Null,0,4,24 October 2001
Titanic," Hate hate hate hate hate hate HATE
","James Cameron is one of my favorite filmmakers,but I loathe TITANIC. Of course,how can I argue with all the teenyboppers who turned it into a hit? This movie is worthless,albeit beautiful. It's just so incredibly precalculated and manipulative and annoying.",Null,3,4,21 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I liked it
","After some unsuccessful attempts to read the books(I found them rather wordy)I saw the movie at home and the movie made me want to try reading the books again. HPATSS is a good movie,very worthy of a viewing. The characters are very likeable,particularly Dumbledore and Hagrid,played respectively by Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane,whose costume looks like a variation of the one he wore as the ghost in BLACKADDER'S CHRISTMAS CAROL.",Null,0,0,25 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Wonderful for the most part
","One of the most fun things about the HARRY POTTER movies is that they are not only a who's who of British acting, but who will be. Daniel Radcliffe. Emma Watson. Rupert Grint. Christian Coulson. They have huge careers ahead of them,and the established actors and actresses all have the time of their lives. Kenneth Branagh was a perfect choice to play Professor Lockhart. So was Miriam Margoyles,as Professor Sprout(one of my personal favorite characters.) Of course,Richard Harris did a masterful job as Headmaster Dumbledore(my favorite character); whoever designed his office deserves an award. Again,the script nearly sucks the fun out of the character,but Harris rose above it. Maggie Smith continues to be an excellent Professor McGonagall,as does Alan Rickman as Snape. Snape is a complex guy,constantly at odds with himself,and Rickman realizes it perfectly. Of course, Robbie Coltrane was born to play Hagrid. Hagrid rules. Then there's David Warner,as Filch,who's pretty ominous. I couldn't tell if Mrs. Norris was a real cat or not. Speaking of animals: Fawkes kicks ass. So does Hedwig. There's a rumor that Hedwig is actually Madame Hooch; it makes sense to me. And Dobby is no Jar Jar Binks. Dobby is hellarious, and some of the things he did dropped my jaw. Jason Isaacs was pitch-perfect as Lucius Malfoy. Of course,there's the subplot about wizard prejudice; it is handled well,particularly when they tell Hagrid about Hermione being called a mudblood. I love the way Hagrid and Hermione deal with it.
The special effects ranged from amazing to not bad. If you haven't read the books,I'll just say that something happens to Harry's arm and the the translation from page to screen is amazing,as is the 'eat SLUGS!' bit. The Burrow is another triumph of set design(loved the clock.)
Cons: Warwick Davis didn't have any lines at all. Zoe Wannamaker(Madame Hooch) was missing. No one noticed J.K. Rowling's cameo except me. Again,there were things I really wanted to see that didn't make it into the movie or were changed around. I keep hearing complaints from people about how the ending dragged on and on and on. To those people,I say: sit down and shut up until the storytellers are finished. The ending is great and I'm glad I saw this movie on a big screen instead of waiting for video.",Null,0,1,29 November 2002
Jaws," A perfect movie
","This is one of those movies where everything just comes together- interesting characters,great dialogue,beautiful cinematography,anda story that pulls in the viewer. From beginning to end,JAWS is absolutely engrossing and genuinely affecting. It remains Steven Spielberg's magnum opus. Forget the sequels-the original is the only true JAWS.",10,1,2,9 January 2002
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," This is one of those timeless classics...
","This film is honest. It takes the viewer through a whole gamut ofemotion-you'll laugh your head off,you'll cry,you'll cheer and generally be amazed at this film: SNOW WHITE is a total fairy tale with the scary parts left intact. The animation is unparalleled; this film has an uncommon power that really feels magical. It's on the level with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This film made an unforgettable appearance in the movie GREMLINS. ('They're watching SNOW WHITE...and they LOVE it...')",Null,2,3,2 June 2002
The Lion King," Wonderful
","A great voice cast really elevates this film. James Earl Jones makesthe audience care about Mufasa and it's terrible when he dies,but I can't help thinking of Obi-Wan Kenobi's death in STAR WARS when he tells Vader 'Kill me now,and I shall become more powerful than youcan EVER imagine...' and that's exactly what happens to Mufasa-hebecomes one with the land. Madge Sinclair was also great as Mufasa's queen,Sarabi,who's probably the most interesting character in the film; she endures even after her world is ripped apart and we love her for it. Sinclair's death robbed us of a great actress. The one thing I would've changed: Sarabi should have killed Scar,not the hyenas. Other than that,it's a powerful movie,not as good as BEAUTY AND THEBEAST,but it's good enough. One of those movies you just have to see on a big screen to appreciate its scope.",Null,0,0,28 May 2002
Shrek," Not one for the ages
","I can't stand this movie. It's not as clever as it wants to think it is. I couldn't stand the music or the fart jokes. The emperor has no clothes,folks,and in SHREK's case,he's swinging his weiner at the audience.",Null,0,2,13 February 2002
Identity," My favorite kind of movie
","I saw IDENTITY the second day it was out,with a theatre full of people. Of course,there was one couple who brought their obstreporous kid,but they got out of there. Of course,they absorbed our death stares first, because this kid screamed like a banshee in need of Ritalin. Natural selection is just a theory,because those idiots would have beenweeded out long ago.IDENTITY is one of those movies where things lie under the surface of reality...I think IDENTITY could become one of my favorite movies. It's wonderfully written, ominous, and truly scary. The filmmakers set out to tell you a story and tell it well. IDENTITY is 90 minutes of gleeful nastiness populated by people who have serious personal problems. The cast is wonderful,including Pruitt Taylor Vince, John Cusack, Jake Busey, and the invaluable John C. McGinley. I feel it's destined to become a classic. As for the ending...well,I thought it ruled. It was ridiculous, but it was wonderful. 'Whores don't GET a second chance!'",Null,0,0,3 May 2003
Cube," A math phobic's ultimate nightmare
",You're trying to escape from a boobytrapped complex of cubes...you're hungry and tired and reaching your breaking point...and the only way out is MATH. This movie is both terrifying and intellectual. My only complaint is that the ending seems a little rushed,Null,0,1,5 February 2002
Aladdin," Worth watching
","ALADDIN is a very funny movie; the characters-even Rasoul-are genuinely likeable and Robin Williams does an amazing job as the Genie. It's not BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,but it's still worth watching if you have 90 minutes to waste.",Null,1,1,16 January 2002
Pocahontas," Revisionist PC hogwash
","Just thinking about POCAHONTAS makes me want to vomit. Just because it's an animated film does not give it license to play fast and loose with the truth. I didn't care about any of the characters in thisfilm,and I hated the songs. I hate it when a film talks AT you rather than TO you,and that is exactly what POCAHONTAS does. The animation is beautiful,I will give it that.",Null,1,5,8 April 2003
The Wedding Singer," Well,what do you know-a watchable Adam Sandler movie
","I don't think I need to tell you that most Adam Sandler movies aregeared towards a certain demographic who need profanity,fart jokes and violence to keep them from drooling into their popcorn. But THEWEDDING SINGER is actually FUNNY. I can't believe how likeable this movie is. I didn't feel like my intelligence had been insulted. It'sa howl from start to finish,particularly Sandler's incredible take on 'Holiday' and any scene with Steve Buscemi. Even Billy Idol does a good job.",Null,1,1,14 June 2002
