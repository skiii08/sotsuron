Black Swan," A total masterpiece!!
","Excellent thriller with a fascinating scenario. Brilliant acting by the beautiful Natalie Portman, even though that year had some great other movies with great leading actresses performances, Natalie deserved all the awards she got for her outstanding performance of a role that gave a fine elucidation of a human being suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. What I liked the most about the movie and what made it different from any other 'Motivational, inspirational movies' is the psychological depth in the script and the dialogs. I really love how Nina outdid her mother's jealousy and nailed the Swan queen role. Simbly, my favorite psychological thriller ever.",10,2,4,17 October 2015
