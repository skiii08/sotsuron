Moneyball," baseball 21st century style
","The movie was a pleasant surprise I find most sports movies are trite and predictable, but Moneyball was extremely watchable and held my interest for the two hours. Brad Pitt obviously dug into the role of Billy Beane. He knew he really did not have much in Oakland either with the players or the stadium,but he stayed true to character by turning down the Boston GM position. I wondered why he did not fire Art Howe when he caught the team 'celebrating' in the locker room after a loss. Terry Francona got fired in Boston last year for the team doing similar behavior as Oakland was showing but Beane was not seen as taking Howe to task for allowing this to occur doing the season. As Howe was unhappy with his one year contract, I would have taken this as a personal affront and dumped him Beane had a short fuse and attention span as his actions proved. He wanted easy, short answers to questions The long winded responses the scouts came up with as to player development and acquisitions was not his style The more he heard, the more he saw it was to be his way or the highway He did not need or care to field input from the scouting organization. Overall, the movie was about a strong personality as well as baseball.",9,0,1,13 March 2012
