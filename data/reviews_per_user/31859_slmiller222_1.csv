United 93," Awesome, Heroic, Powerful
","The Movie 'United 93' is about the fourth flight on 9/11, the only one that did not reach its target. This movie is about 40 brave people who fought back and started a passenger revolt against the hijackers. In the end, they all lose their lives. I thought this movie was powerful because I thought that Paul Greengrass did an amazing job at directing the movie. It seemed to me that it had no Hollywood basis and it was what experts think thats what happened on 9/11. At the end of the movie at the theater, no one said a word. No one clapped, one one cried, or laughed or applauded. I would recommend everyone see this movie. It is Powerful and just plain amazing.",10,1,3,11 June 2006
