Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the lost ark review
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is a unique film like no other. This film like the other three films gives you the adventure feels that our main character Indy does. The thing that works very well is the companionship between the director Spielberg and Lucas they created a wonderful adventurous world. The story is so well structured, from the setup to the confrontation, it keeps us at the edge of our seats without a single yawn. Let's talk about Harrison Ford and Karen Allen, their companionship in the movie is amazing Marion (Karen Allen) is not that girl that always needs to be saved by Indy (Harrison Ford), in some occasions she saves Indy's life. Our hero Indy (Harrison Ford) has the word iconic written on his forehead, he is the perfect hero he is charming, bad ass, smart everything a hero needs. The movie has an exceptional movie score by Academy award winning John Williams, his score is tense and brilliant. The movie has incredible shots the cinematography is quite amazing, as well as those visual effects, and nails a perfect editing. The direction from Steven Spielberg is fantastic we can see he really did put effort into the movie. Overall this is one of the best films of all time (My favorite movie) it has action, romance, suspense, and it is for the whole family, the kids will love this film. Seek this film out!",10,0,0,5 August 2017
