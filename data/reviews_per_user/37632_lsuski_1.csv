The Benchwarmers," A lot of fun
","I went expecting that all the funny lines had been used up in the trailer but I was pleasantly surprised. I laughed all the way through. I enjoyed the chemistry between Rob Schnieder, John Heder, and David Spade. The casting for the geek kids was great also. I especially enjoyed spitting kid. I don't really like baseball so I thought the movie would drag for me but the guys were so funny that I enjoyed every moment. The old man in the video store was a great addition as was the albino brother. This is a movie with a good heart, a lot of laughs and definitely worth seeing.",9,1,3,10 April 2006
