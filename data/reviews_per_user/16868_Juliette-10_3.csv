Catch Me If You Can," One not to miss - that means you too, Oscar.
","First of all I should probably declare my bias - I am definitely NOT a Speilberg fan.  So when I heard the hoopla on this film - as yet another gem from the Speilberg stable I was sceptical.  However, I did find two reasons to overcome my aversion to Steve and go anyway - the fact that it is based on a real-life person (hey, it might be educational) and secondly, that it signals the end of a two-year hiatus for DiCaprio.  Okay, okay - I'm sure there are quite a few of you out there who base his entire career on Titanic - but for those of us who have seen a number of his smaller, 'indie' projects you'll know what I mean.And, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  Gone are the long build-ups that Speilberg favours.  Out, too, goes all of the schmaltz he has tended to dollop onto his movies of late.  And, probably best of all, he gives us a movie in which Tom Hanks doesn't cry (oh come on, name another one!). Instead we get a tightly-scripted foray into the world of grand larceny through the eyes of a 17-year old boy.DiCaprio and Walken are both brilliant in their respective roles.  Walken is both endearing and infuriating as the idealistic dreamer of a father who can't (or won't) understand why the IRS keep pursuing him for his taxes. DiCaprio, on the other hand, pulls off a double-whammy by being both enigmatic enough to be able to pull off the con-jobs while at the same time, never allowing you to forget that he is only a boy.  DiCaprio's treatment of 'Frank' is neither condescending or trite - something many actors today could learn when playing teenagers.However, that is not to say the movie is without its flaws.  The first is Hanks.  Often held up to be one of the greatest actors today, here he flounders against not only DiCaprio and Walken but against much of the supporting cast as well.  He just doesn't seem to be able to find a rhythm for his character and instead seems to be trying a different tack in each scene.The other flaw is that obsessive need of many American directors to bring psychological theory into their movies to increase the dramatic gravitas. We do not need to be told the reasons why 'Frank' embarked on his crime spree for two reasons: 1, DiCaprio has already done it for him through his sensitive, three-dimensional portrayal of 'Frank'; and 2, because the charm of this kind of movie ultimately resides in the fact that each of us find a certain appeal in 'Frank's' actions - both the audacity and the flair he shows in being able to pull off these heists. In saying all of that, this movie is one not to miss - and that means you too, Oscar.  DiCaprio was robbed for What's Eating Gilbert Grape - don't let it happen again.",9,0,1,19 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," They got it right
",Well I've gone over to the Dark Side and it's a much sexier place I can tell you.Loved the movie - really benefits from professional script-writers this time round and I heard that apparently Lucas left a lot of the scene direction to his AD and you can tell. This one can actually claim to be a Star Wars movie. Yoda is much better - good decision to go digital I think and the fight between him and Darth Sidious is awesome.Hayden Christensen and Ewen McGregor really come into their own in this film (because they've been allowed to I think - see comments about AD). HC looks awesome - apparently put on an extra 11 kilos to play the grown Anakin and that's a good thing (okay I realise only some of you will appreciate the gratuitous topless scenes). Natalie Portman leaves the butt-kicking behind in this one (the fans will know why) which is actually good because she really shines in these sorts of roles (eg Mathilda in The Professional). There's a lot of digs at the current US administration in this one - at one point Senator Amidala comments 'there is the death of democracy to the sound of rapturous applause' (or something like that I've only seen it once so far) and lots of navel gazing about which side is in fact the 'good' side in this one. But ultimately the moral of the story is that the ends never justify the means - even if you do have prophesy backing you up (and it's not just the prophesy you're thinking of).,9,1,6,19 May 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Stop reading reviews, just go and see it
","It's finally NZ's turn to see this film and now I totally understand the hype surrounding it at recent award ceremonies.I really enjoyed this film - Danny Boyle and his cinematographers have outdone themselves by managing to capture the 'bigness' of India- the sounds, the sights, the vastness of the landscapes and the sheer amount of people. However the individuals within this place are not forgotten with the nine actors who play Jamal, Salim and Katika doing an outstanding job of making their characters' 'ordinariness' extraordinary.A lot has been made about the way Jamal's story unfolds (in flashback we are shown how this 'cheat' really did know the answers to Who Wants to be a Millionaire). I haven't read the book Q&A on which the movie is based so I don't know whether this is a feature introduced during the screenplay or not. Either way I think it works and stylistically it is very appropriate as it reminded me of Bollywood movies that I've seen.That said it isn't all glitz and glamour and Boyle, as his fans no doubt expect, has not shied away from the darker aspects of slum life. However he does this respectfully and without exploiting his characters. What is perhaps most amazing to me about this film is that, even after showing us the sheer desperation of these characters, Boyle still manages to pull it together for a truly exciting finish.Right now there are vast numbers of positive reviews around about this movie so you will just have to go and see it.",10,1,5,3 February 2009
