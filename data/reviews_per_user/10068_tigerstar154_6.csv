Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Interesting
","On Stranger TidesI had mixed reactions to this movie, half of the time I was bored and half of the time I was into the movie.Jack Sparrow and others try to find the fountain of youth.Plus: Johnny Depp kept from watching this big bore and the action scenes Minus: Too much cleavage for a Disney Movie, annoying accents, and ugly people.On the whole, don't expect much. I missed Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. They should have stopped at three movies. Next time, make a movie called Pirates of Somalia.",Null,0,1,2 April 2012
Ted," Funny
","TedSo I saw this movie last week and I enjoyed it. I was pretty excited that Seth MacFarlene was behind this project so that was one reason for me to enjoy it. Soooo, a 35 year old man faces a dilemma: he must between his girlfriend or his teddy bear that he loved since his childhood.The Pluses: The main pair, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, Seth MacFarlence, The sequence at the party, the endingThe Minuses: Not appropriate for kids under 18, the humor is the same style as Family GuyOverall, Ted is a good movie. It was not super hilarious but it was just regular hilarious. This is not suitable for kids under 18.",9,1,6,15 July 2012
Hotel Rwanda," Epic
","Hotel RwandaWhenever we see historical movies, we think of it as boring. But, This movie i saw it a 1000 times and it has moved me every time. It represents a conflict long forgotten and how we the West messed up Africa and ignored their pleas for help.Paul Rusasabangina a hotel manager, manages to protect innocent villagers from a hardcore militia in his hotel.The Pluses: Don Cheadles Acting, the scene with Cheadle, his wife and his bro at night, the violent scenes and the ending. Also, the nurse and Cheadles friend is a delight. Did I mention this is a true story.The Minuses: Nothing, except the violence and gore is not for the weak hearted.Overall, Hotel Rwanda is a great movie. Only those with patience can absorb this movie.",9,1,1,7 February 2012
Crash," Thought Provoking
","CrashBefore I review this movie, let me ask you this: have u ever been mistaken for another ethnicity? Do you think the way people act is 'racially motivated?' Crash boasting of an ensemble cast, examines racism and bigotry in Los Angeles.In 36 hours, many Los Angelers lives will be affected due to ones actions and there are connected to each other in some way.The Pluses: The acting of ALL members, the topic, (Racism). What I also liked was the positive portrayal of the Persians. Don Cheadle was the entire reason I watched this film.The minuses: Lotta cussing so keep that in mind.Overall, This Academy Award winner film was the best and it has changed the way I thought of the person next to me. I give it a 9/10",9,0,4,29 February 2012
Hugo," Interesting
","HugoAs I saw this film, i thought i would find this boring but i Did not. You'll be hooked to see what happens.A little boy who lives in a railway station tries to find out more about his father.The Pluses: The scenery of Paris, the acting, the CGI and the robot, direction by yours truly Martin Scorsese.The Minuses: A little slow the first 10-15 minutes, and a British accent, in France??Overall, Hugo is a good film. You will like it, as my me and my family did.",8,3,5,29 April 2012
Cars 2," Great Family Movie
","Cars 2Cars 2 is such a great family movie. Damn those critics who said this was the worst movie ever. It has all the elements for entertainment, though this is not with out its faults. In summary, Mater is recruited as a spy and he must believe in himself when he must save McQueen from a terror plot.The Pluses: The animation, the various setting (Tokyo, Italy, France, England) it makes you feel like you are there. The action, and its various puns. The twist at the end is a big surprise. Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are a delight no doubt.The Minuses: The movie starts off very slow but eventually progresses. I noted a little bias in this as this praises the use of fossil fuels instead of alternative fuel. Why bring politics in a kids movie?Overall, Cars 2 is a great movie for all. Watch this movie with an open mind. It's better than the original.",9,1,3,3 February 2012
