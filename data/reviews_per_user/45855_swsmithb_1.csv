Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," luv'd it!
","Critics be damned,this was just a good old fashioned popcorn chomping movie. Held my interest from beginning to end. The movie developed a nice story and didn't rush things too much early. good pacing by the production team. about 3 quarters of the way through the movie kicks into high gear and never looks back. The train scenes were especially well done, with little sparks from the trestle fire flitting around like fire flys in 3d. Good use of special effects and 3d. Nice to see Rufus Sewell playing a villain again. Also a very nice blending of fiction and history. Hadn't seen the actor playing Abraham Lincoln before. But he made the role seem entirely believable. The only other movies I have seen recently were Snow White and the Huntsman and the Avengers. This movie is better than either of those two...",8,4,8,26 June 2012
