The Blair Witch Project," absolute CRAP!!
","and thats putting it midly..I'm sorry but it was, is and always will be boring, and a waste of time (and money) to see.And the reason is thus...it dwells far too much on them getting lost to get you interested in it. The ending was alright...but only because I was thankful that IT WAS ENDING. DON'T GET HYPED UP TO SEE THIS MOIVE, see it if there is aboslutly NOTHING ELSE to see.this is the only movie I have ever given such a harsh rating of 1/10 to.and the acting wasn't up to scratch either!!!!",1,1,3,31 December 1999
Beauty and the Beast," The best movie disney has ever made!!
","And it is very true!!!It has everything-brilliant detiled animation of high qualitygood voice actingrememberable songsgreat dialogue (I know every part off by heart)and a good storylineDisney has never made any movie up to the quality of this
Aladin and The Lion king came close but lacked the beauty, grace and FEELING this had.This is truly a film for all ages.I am 19 and I still love it....10/10",10,0,1,19 April 2000
Pitch Black," Killer shovels from outer space!!
","How to make the aliens for this movie.1. add one alien from (the movie aliens) 2 add a garden shovel 3 a few litres of blue paint (for blood)and voila YOU GET THE ALIENS FOR THIS MOVIEAnd my weren't they good!I liked this movie I found it entertaining. However I thought the blue and yellow `tint' they put on it made the movie look like it was a cheaply made (which it wasn't).It was slow to start but impoved...however. It would have been better if we had a great chase scene with them getting attacked on all side. Sadly this didn't happen and most of the time our evil hammer-headed killer shovels were hidden in the darkness.Great movie however I didn't like the way they delt with one of the characters.You will know what I mean when you see the ending, and I'm not going to spoilt it for you :) 
and I loved the aliens....even if they did looks like killer shovels from hell ..8/10",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
American Beauty," I laughed for all the wrong reasons!!
","I saw this movie last week and having heard nothing about it (except that it was disgusting) I was not overly hyped.All the way through the movie I kept wondering where I had heard the main male characters voice...it was not until later I was told he was Kevin Spacely, the guy who did the voice of hopper in A BUGS LIFE.There are 3 main groups of people who comment on this movie. The first (like me) thought it was funny..but not worth the hype. The second hated it saying it was perverted and sick...I was told that half the people left the cinema while seeing this movie. And the third absolutly loved it and overhyped it, so ruining everyone elses perseptons of it.
Yes it is a good movie but it is not worth the overall 9/10 rating.
It was spoilt by the beginning where we are told the main character will die (I don't see this as a spoiler because it is the first thing you hear when you see it) which in my opinion ruins the ending. I think the ending would have been more shocking if it was not anticipated.The blonde teenager was overly sterotyped...I absolutly HATE the 'sterotyped teenspeak' and the plastic bag thing was boring..BUT served a brilliant symbolic purpose. I laughed for all the wrong reasons in this film, I see it as a black comedy, and thankfully there were no really gratuatis sex scenes in it, however it is cringe-worthy through out the film as we see (among other things) the fathers disgusting fantasies about his daughters friend.
All in all a good way to spend your afternoon, but I would only give it an 8/10. I am the type of person to rate movies based mainly  on how entertaining it was. However, just because *I* rated it that does not mean the whole board should give it such a high rating. I know is sounds silly, but when you compare other films of a much greater calibre which are given lower rating it seems such a shame. Overall the board should have given it a 7 or an 8.<..>",9,0,0,10 March 2000
The Lion King," a rip off of the LAND BEFORE TIME
","warning (a few of my comments may contain spoilers, not that it will make any difference to your viewing pleasure) Now even though I think this movie is entertaining, it is not however better than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (Disneys best by far)and it has a very unoriginal story line and is a rip off of the LAND BEFORE TIME (see my comment on it). And here is why....1) simba's father died just like littlefoot's mother died2) the circle of life thing....Don Bluth thought of that first and it became a central part of THE LAND BEFORE TIME. Disney did not 'invent' it.3) the orphaned child gets revenge by killing their tormentor. Scar vs the T Rex. Coincidence???also has any one ever seen KIMB THE WHITE LION (created by the makers of ASTERO BOY) the lion kink is also copied from this lovey japanese cartoon series.Well I just couldn't help pointing it out.The songs are great and the animation is lovely. But I think the movie could be improved bya) eliminating timone and pumba (or just getting rid of timone)b)  use african voices for the movie. I mean this IS Africa for god's sake. Why oh why do we have to listen to horrible american accents when we could be happy with the wonderful african ones. Despite what Disney may lead our poor children to think, our world is full of wonderful diverse accents and unfortunately only the american ones are used.All in all I give this movie a 9/10 as it is entertaining despite its unoriginal story line.Scar was my favourite and it is a pity he did not get a bigger part.ps  look at his paws and you will see that sometimes the pads on his front paws join in some scenes and in others he has separate pads for each toe. There's one mistake that disney forgot to fix.",9,0,0,5 December 1999
The Iron Giant," If it weren't for the animation I would give it a 10!!
","Which is basically it. When you compare this type of animation with (dare I even mention it) Disney you feel quite let down. The people are unrealistic but this can be tolerated because they are stylised, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. Some of the backgrounds ARE beautiful especially the sea and snow, it is also nice to see how the weather and seasons slowly change throughout the film. The main problem (as I see it) is that some objects, especially the cars and quite noticeably the tractor looks 2 dimensional. This is the first time I have ever noticed this on ANY movie. I suppose it is because the quality of animation does not match the background.The actual robot is computer animated but because he is put into a movie with low quality animation you simply don't notice it, instead the robot looks like he was drawn with great care by a skilled animator (with normal animation) and then placed in TV quality animation.But I am afraid I am just being picky the quality of animation is unlike don Bluth or Disney but it is effective. After 10 or 20 minutes you forget about the animation and fall in love with the story.This is one movie where the STORYLINE TOOK PLACE OVER THE EFFECTS AND ANIMATION. Which is a nice change especially since the horrible trash Disney produced last year with Tazan. This is what made it such a pleasure to watch. It is a touching film in which I dare anyone to view and not feel compassion for the giant robot with a big heart. The animators did a noticeably good job at making a ridged iron face show warmth and love .(WARNING THE NEXT FEW LINE MAY CONTIAN MINOR SPIOLERS DEPENDING ON YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW)The part when he prodded the dead dear and when he thought the boy was dead was quite frankly a masterpiece of effort. It is this sort of atmosphere that so many modern animated films lack. The LAND BEFORE TIME showed this depth of sadness and it can be seen with this film as well. To really enjoy a happy ending you must first feel sadness and pain. This is how I feel anyway a sad part in a film is essential for getting it's audience to care about it's characters. I gave this movie 9 out of 10, because I really do think the quality of animation (not the style the quality) could have been improved.But the best comment I can make on this movie is this- I asked my little 7 year old brother whether he liked the movie or not and he said `I WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN' . He had never said that about any movie he has seen. So I can think of no higher praise for such a brilliant movie.",9,1,2,17 April 2000
