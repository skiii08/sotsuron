Ford v Ferrari," Here's what you need to know before you watch Speed King.
","What exactly did Enzo Ferrari's purple ink pen circle?
For Car Lovers, the most anticipated movie of 2019 is 'Ford V Ferrari.'.Of course, 'Speed Car King' as a commercial film, while restoring history, there are also deductive elements in it.Why did Ford buy Ferrari?
Ford and Ferrari, in the 1960s, when cars were not highly globalized, were simply two car companies that could not compete.One is the American overlord who pushes automobile production into the modern process, the other is the Apennine overlord who is immersed in automobile racing.
The two are on different continents and are not competitors in the same field, and their situations are even more different.1960-1970 was the golden decade age of explosive growth for Ford and all American car companies.During that decade, the annual production of individual models under Ford's main brand increased from 300,000 units to nearly 800,000 units. For Ford, which is aimed at the general audience, they have enough capital to do some things in circles.
Ferrari in the 1960s was in dire Straits, facing a situation that could not be uncovered at any time.Racing is a very expensive sport, a team behind the big boss to inject capital, the racing department needs to rely on car companies to obtain funds.At that time, Ferrari was like a single 'Iron Han Han', no matter when and when, sports cars were only owned by minority groups.By selling sports cars, or selling racing cars to independent teams to feed the entire R & D team to form a closed-loop, this road is becoming narrower and narrower by Ferrari.Until 1963, Enzo Ferrari sat at the same negotiating table as Henry Ford II.
In the case of Ford, their purpose was clear - to move into the European car market.At that time, Europe was an incremental market for American automobile companies, but there was a very embarrassing problem in front of them:At least in the field of automobiles, Americans have no sense of superiority in European land.Why was the deal called off at the last second?
Ford wants to buy Ferrari, and Ferrari also needs to find a 'golden master dad' as a backer. This seems to be a good deal for you. It should be smooth sailing. What exactly caused the transaction to crash?Of course, it is not because there is a 'mole.'.
Ferrari's private secretary, Franco Gozzi, wrote in an Italian car magazine about Ford's acquisition of Ferrari.He referred to the clause that angered Ferrari the most and led him to walk out of the meeting - 'each item was over 450 million lire (about $257,000 at the time) of the team's budget.Enzuo had to apply to Ford for approval.'On the agreement, Enzuo circled the words 'submitted' and 'acquired' with his purple ink pen, and wrote 'not acceptable' next to them.
Enzuo was an unruly man, and it is precisely because of his temper that he has created many popular stories in the history of automobiles.In his view, the rules and regulations given to him by Ford seriously affected his freedom of management of the team, which he had suffered for decades in the field.
According to the description of Ford Department manager Fei Lei, in the process of negotiations between the two sides for nearly a month, there are also other factors of discord.Enzuo, for example, has been critical of Shelby's relationship with Ford, and his bid to enter the Indy 500 has been thwarted by Ford.",9,2,3,4 April 2020
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel exposed the flaws in this phase of the Marvel films.
","I saw a short review of high praise that this is the normal play of Marvel, do not expect any surprises.In fact, even Marvel movies, it is also an aberration.
As a super British fan, I am very disappointed with Captain Marvel.There are always Marvel fans arguing about who is the best in the Marvel Universe?
Iron man? Thor? The Hulk ? Captain America?Today, the movie of the strongest hero is released.
Captain Marvel.
Back in the day, the avengers were exhausted from fighting alien attacks on earth.Iron man almost died trying to push the bomb.
One team, against the entire alien force.This is the combat effectiveness of the alliance.
Captain Marvel, on the other hand, carries the firepower of the entire Starfleet.
She stood between the earth and the fleet, clasped her hands, scattered her light, looked at each other, and retreated.
I thought it was the beginning, but I didn't think it was the end.
This is Captain Marvel's fighting capacity.
Then what?
The strongest? More special effects? Save the universe?",7,0,2,14 April 2020
Knives Out," The deep truth about the possibility of the blade being unsheathed
","Is the heroine the real conspirator behind the scenes?
At the end of the balcony hostess end cup and the following family crowd look at each other, ironic.
The female host finally showed a smile when she looked at Hugh, and there was a possibility that she would become the final winner.
The heroine shook her legs many times, especially in the face of Harlan's portrait.
It seems that the symptom of lying and vomiting can also be self-controlled, which makes people guess whether she can guide the truth through this means.
In the film, the detective said that the dog knows the good and evil of people, and the heroine throws the clue away, the dog sends the clue to the detective again, which seems to be a metaphor.",9,2,4,20 April 2020
Juno," Youth is still pure.
","Juno, as soon as I saw the words and pictures of the cartoon treatment at the beginning, I felt very right. Clear and clean music, warm and brilliant sunshine, rendering a cool youth.In fact, I don't know how to state such a thing.Such a thing, which is actually very heavy or can be described as terrible, is told in such a relaxed tone.
A 16-year-old child, walking through a big tub of orange juice to make the ingredients for three pregnent tests.Call women now with a cute hamburger-type phone, with bad phone contact and a shake.
Tell the boy, I think, I should nip it in the bud, because, according to my physiology class, once you get pregnant, you're more likely to have a baby.The boy said, 'Generally speaking, yes, just like mothers and teachers.'
The boy's classmate said, did you know Juno was pregnant? Like our mother and our teacher?Do you know it's yours? You are so good! I think you should grow a beard.
Why is everyone looking at me? Because your stomach is a sphere. Wow, you're learning geometry.
Again and again, I can't help laughing. It turns out that things can also be described as less horrible.
Some of the details are actually very touching.
The stepmother said, in any case, thank God for this gift.
The father said, I thought you were a girl who knew when enough was enough. Juno was silent for a moment, with a rare seriousness and helplessness in his eyes, and said, I don't know what kind of girl I am.
In fact, no one knows who is what. Just don't judge people.
In fact, she should not be defined as a bad child, should she?
At least she can bravely to bear, to bear the consequences of their actions, to bear the pain of pregnancy in October.She can't watch movies with her classmates, smash donuts, and endure all the strange looks, but she doesn't blame anyone.She even got angry when the boy asked another girl out, and then felt that she was wrong.
It takes courage to face and bear it. She did the best she could and took responsibility.
Maybe youth is like this. Parents always want their children not to wrestle. It's better not to fall, but if you fall . so what?Maybe there will be some pain, but at least it will not fall into disability, and it will not constitute an obstacle to continue on the road in the future. That'll do it.
Sunshine is still bright, youth is still brilliant.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Essay after feeling
","Dim Meng is the best actor in the whole audience; On the Similarity between Tom Hiddleston and Dumb Cute
I am the only one who likes long hair and waist hammer, alas, I hammer the beauty of the golden age, ah, distressed.
Rocky's ending is still relatively satisfied, before looking at the real death, after all, the first two each fake death once.
The jokes are too dense, the face and the chair are a little loose.
Why are so many people not satisfied with such a sad theme to fight back against this retro and futuristic science fiction road movie.
The male God's dimensional wall has been completely broken.",8,1,4,20 April 2020
Interstellar," In my mind, science fiction is the first.
","The core of this film is a family drama, a story about love and commitment between father and daughter.The film allows the most real and warm feelings and waiting of human beings to naturally infiltrate into the grand and solemn human epic of space immigrants.Nolan is good at wrapping sincere emotions in a grand narrative, and his manipulation and expression are undoubtedly superb.
This story deduces a true father-daughter relationship that really crosses time and space.Although the theme of 'love through time and space' has been ruined by countless romantic fantasy online novels, this film can make people cry, because it is so pure and true, so similar to our lives.Cooper does not have the ambition of 'my journey is the sea of stars', but only wants to complete the task as soon as possible to return to her daughter to accompany her growth.In the autumn of human survival, Murphy's final choice of safe haven is still the place with the most memories of his father.",8,0,1,7 April 2020

","Yes, life is full of uncertainty & puzzle. For someone, they wish to have the power to forecast future. Because they can be well prepare for the opportunities and challenges and even know the lucky numbers of lottery beforehand. But for me, I don't want to have such 'ability' at all.

I enjoy the surprise of receiving gift from my classmates on my birthday and running into an old friend on the street in another city, etc. There are so many amazing incidents in my life which can't be happen if I have the power to forecast the future.
To Forrest Gump, who was born with intellectual disturbance and muscle problem in his leg, he never imagined that he could become a famous American football player, a war hero and even a millionaire. Forrest won dignity and respect though his strive and perseverance.
I believe I can make a better life for those I love though my own effort. Have a little faith for your life. Let's enjoy our life everyday with dignity, honesty, braveness and love just like Forrest Gump!",10,1,1,17 March 2020

This story actually belongs to two names, amber river and chihiro. Miyazaki has the world's most powerful fantasy, he gives you more than you want. Well, with suffering, not with falsehood.

Saving Private Ryan," Ten of the Best Hollywood War Movies of All Time
","War movies are not always bloody and brutal.Before Spielberg's blockbuster Saving Private Ryan, many war films had reserved their revelations about the brutality of war.When we watch the best war movies, we really don't just use our eyes.
1. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1930): A film about World War I that was very popular at the time and is still very powerful: the battle scenes are spectacular and the characters are impressive.It is an excellent film that both critics and audiences are unanimously optimistic about.
2. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (1957): The film begins in a POW camp and follows the story of the building and bombing of a bridge.However, the theme of the whole work is vague and ambiguous, which makes people unable to judge right and wrong immediately, and reveals the pluralism and conflict of cultures very profoundly.So people are drawn to watch it again and again, and every time there is a new harvest.
3. Lawrence of Arabia (1962): The story of a British soldier's rise from maverick to hero during World War I.
4. 'Qiaiboshi' (1964): If you want to see a fight scene, you're going to be so disappointed that you can't even see the enemy.But this is a far-reaching war film, the significance of the film is to let people see about the dangers of the Cold War mentality.A mistake, or the selfish thoughts of individual people, can destroy our beautiful home and warm life.
5. Army Field Hospital (1970)
6. Apocalypse Now (1979)
7. Platoon (1986)
8.Glory (1989)
9. Braveheart (1995)
10.

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Over-marketing
","If a movie maliciously discredits another person (no matter what race or status), it's fine not to show it.

Frozen," The dignity of classical beauty
","The original idea of going to the cinema was to see this as a technology Demo.I was stunned at the very beginning.
From the beginning of Frozen to the end of let it go, the film is completely on the high level.The technical gap is not so terrible,
In this film, Disney has demonstrated his strong artistic foundation.
All the time to show the top of the classical art atmosphere, ballet + opera + oil painting.
You can only see it at the royal opera house and the national gallery.I used to think that a movie could be called a masterpiece if only one scene could catch up with classic paintings and one scene could catch up with classic scenes of opera. Disney was tough from the start to let it go, and it never fell off that level.
Look at the composition and color, you know that this is a decade of classical oil painting.
The leading role of a bow, a pull skirt, is the bottom of the stage play for ten years.
As soon as the symphonic background music is played, one can tell that he has written opera from the top.The last time my sister came to my sister's rescue, it was something the italians played with five hundred years ago.

Her," An unusual love story.
","It's not just that it takes the quirky Angle of 'nerds falling in love with computer operating systems,' but that at least director spike jonze explores 'everything about love' in a way that's so refreshing it's a cinder. Most classic romance movies, I think, are treated like war movies. How the main characters fall in love is not the point: one chance encounter is expected to last forever, one eye promise to last forever, and the focus is mostly on overcoming obstacles: romeo and Juliet against family feuds, Roman holiday has class gaps, brokeback mountain is a gender barrier. To put it bluntly, it's all about the 'fight to be together' that starts with sex drive -- the audience is happy to accept the 'love at first sight' premise and then watch the protagonist fight his way through it.
This kind of love movie hypnotizes the audience the sharp weapon, is the leading character entire process holds the determination 'no matter what, I want us to be together', what is the end point?The heart-wrenching love movie ends with our heroic courage, and the lover ends up as a family member. The love movie that tears people's tears ends with a strong enemy.It's not a war movie. What is it?
That's what I love about 'Her,' and what I find new. The dialogue in the script is too interesting: although the film talks about 'man-machine love',But Spike was smart enough to use 'future world' '' Set to resolve the public's acceptance of this kind of abnormal love.He just used this special angle to study the causes of pheromone fermentation after physical attraction and to explore the law of the death of love outside the external resistance.This observation is even more extreme and pure when one side of the relationship is set to a fleshless computer operating system.
Perhaps in Spike's view, sexual attraction is insurmountable, but frustrating.Whether it's the opening scene where the main character peeks at pornographic pictures on the subway, or the extremely stupid and sad 'Cyber-Sex', or the subsequent attempt of the system OS to rent a body.The directors are all elaborating on such a thing: sex is the most primitive and less important part of human relations. It is an appendix that cannot be removed in the human communication system, and it is also a blinding method that hinders our self-cognition.
After getting rid of the shackles of the body, the essential obstacle of human communication is to cross the gap of self-consciousness.
It is not easy to build a solid relationship with others, one by communication, the other by compromise.
Communication is the most urgent and difficult thing for people. In addition to survival, people need to communicate to solve all spiritual problems such as loneliness and fear.When I was young, I cried when I was hungry, shouted when I was afraid, adolescence, hormones were strong, and I was eager to say 'like', which were direct enough, but lacked skills.People think that with the growth of age, the more skilled skills, communication problems will be solved.On the contrary, the more accurate the expression is, the more it deviates from the purpose of the expression; the more familiar the expression is, the more doubt the sincerity of the expression, of course, and the other.
In her, jiekunfeinikesi, as a mail agent writer, is skilled at 'Transfer' emotion, but thus fell into a greater obstacle to expression.Since he is better than others at creating false lyric, in the real world, the more lack of window to express true feelings.That's why Theodore can successfully flirt at the dinner table. That's technique.But because the other side of a sincere question and panic, that is the essence-good adults tell lies easily, tell the truth is difficult, say the heart is even more difficult.
Adult communication costs a lot, and sometimes it has nothing to do with courage and sincerity, but because everyone lives in their own world.I love the part in the movie where Amy Adams as Amy plucks up the courage to show her husband and Theodore her own documentary, and she's so full of anticipation that they don't know why.The embarrassment of 'you think you know me, but you don't know me' really makes any words of relief from Theodore and advice from Amy's husband seem silly and superfluous.
If you doubt the conclusion that everyone has a strong desire to express, but in fact others do not care, think about it in reverse.How many times do we talk to others in a perfunctory way, pretending that we care, or even giving sincere advice with exaggerated expressions, without actually taking it seriously?When the OS system does the basic test for Theodore, it interrupts the indifference without waiting for Theodore to express his feelings, which is the normal inner play of human communication.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
