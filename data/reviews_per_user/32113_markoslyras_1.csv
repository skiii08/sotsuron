Scarface," Possibly the greatest movie of all time!
","This is possibly the greatest movie of all time. Al Pacino provides an incredible performance as a Cuban drug-lord who builds an empire in Miami. The story is well-written and you are left dumbfounded by possibly the most famous fictional character since Mickey Mouse, Tony Montana. If you haven't seen it yet, i pity you!",10,0,0,17 January 2001
