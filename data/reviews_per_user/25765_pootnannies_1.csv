Alien 3," The best Alien movie yet
","Alien 3 was, in my opinion, a great film. There are some flaws with the film but the photography, the alien, the characters, it's eerie atmosphere, music, and sound are amazing. The alien's actually scary on this one and they used a rod puppet for the sequences where the alien was running. Most of the time it looks great but there are some shots where it doesn't look as believable. However, for those great shots that do work, you would think it was cgi or even real. David Fincher gave the alien a lot of character making it different but not too different from what fans love about the aliens. A lot of people will say that this film was terrible and the worst of the Aliens movies, but if you're looking for a great film that truly stands out from the rest, than you have to see this one. This movie actually has atmosphere unlike many of the movies you see today. I think it's tragic that many people knock this one down because it doesn't follow the typical movie formula, but give it a try and judge for yourself. Truly one of the most underrated movies out there.",8,1,9,18 January 2006
