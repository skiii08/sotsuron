Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Total New Definition of the Word Humor!
","Okay, I have to admit that I was skeptical when I heard the storyline. I really thought how funny could this be? Then I started hearing all these incredible reviews and watched the trailer. I decided to go see it.I am glad I did too. The movie was one laugh right after another! The United States prides itself on being a politically correct nation. This movie lets us throw that term right out the window for 84 hilarious minutes. That is a big part of what makes this movie work so well.Borat Sagdiyev comes to the United States to try and learn as much as he can about our country and put it into a documentary for his people. The language barrier and the incompatibility of his customs with ours makes for a clash of cultures that will have you walking out of the theater with a smile on your face and wanting more! This movie isn't for everyone though.It has a R rating and rightfully so. If you are easily offended by crude humor or offended by politically incorrect remarks, you should stay far away from this movie. However, if you can see this movie for what it is; a fun comedy, you will love it and have a great time! I sure did!",8,0,5,18 November 2006
The Village," Simply Amazing!
","I have to say that 'The Village' was not what I expected. It was even better! I rated this an 8 because of the slow start, but once it got my attention I was captivated!This has all the makings of a great mystery movie. It starts out in a village set at the turn of the century. The town is isolated by from all the nearby towns by woods that have seemingly intelligent, but vicious creatures in them. The elders that run the town say there is a truce, but none-the-less the creatures make their presence known. (Wouldn't be much of a mystery if nothing happened, now would it?)One of the citizens tries to leave the town to bring needed supplies such as medicine, but is rebuffed by the elders. The people of 'The Village' follow their leaders there without question. Most are happy to stay where they are out of fear of the creatures that live in the woods.This is one of those movies that keep you thinking about it even after you leave because it intentionally doesn't tie up every loose end. Though I usually like resolution in the movies I see, sometimes it has a good fit to certain movies, such as this one. The surprises toward the end will keep you thinking about this for days!Watch and enjoy!",8,0,0,1 August 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," A Really Great Sequel!
","Most of the people that I talked to who didn't like Matrix Reloaded never saw the first one. I don't think the film makers intended for this to be a stand alone movie, but part of the overall picture.If you really want to understand what is going on in this movie you need to see the first Matrix movie. Not seeing it would be a lot like missing out on the first Lord of the Rings or Star Wars movie and trying to pick up on what's going on in the second. I can easily see how someone could be totally lost without the background of the first Matrix picture.The movie provides almost non-stop action. Things start out fast and just keep getting faster!!This was a really great movie and I am looking forward to the final Matrix movie scheduled for release in November!",Null,0,0,7 June 2003
Click," A Wonderful Comedy with a Message for All of Us!
","After reading all the comments and seeing many of the great critics blow off this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I decided it looked like a fun movie and went to go see it. I am glad that I did!Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman who is a workaholic and finds out what dangers lie ahead for those who spend more time with their work than their family. This movie projects both comedy and a message that hits home for an over-worked generation of people.The movie opens with Michael Newman wishing he had more time to spend with his family, but has a manipulative boss (played by David Hasselhoff) who makes Michael decide between him and his family. Michael, thinking that providing for his family is what is most important always seems to go with his work over spending time with his family.Meanwhile, the boy next door is always bragging about all the nice things his family has and all the wonderful things his parents buy him. Hearing this and knowing that he wants to do the same for his family makes Michael all the more determined to provide for his family.One day, needled by his kids that the family next door has a universal remote that controls the TV, Stereo, VCR, DVD, etc. (and Michael being tired of always picking up the wrong remote to do what he wants) decides to treat himself and go out looking for a universal remote control. He then meets a mysterious man named Morty (played by Christopher Walken) who gives him a brand new, not-yet-on-the-market, universal remote that will control everything.When he gets home he later discovers that this is more than just a remote control for things around the house. It it is a remote control for his entire life. What starts out as fun soon turns into a nightmare for poor Michael and in it is a lesson to be learned for all of us. The remote control takes over Michael's life and what happens next is both funny and sad at the same time.I highly recommend everyone take a workaholic friend or significant other to see this movie. There is a lot of humor and a great message for every one of us in it!",8,1,3,15 July 2006
