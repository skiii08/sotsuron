Blade Runner 2049," A great ride with just enough homage to original
","Truly a great work with solid performances from the main characters, and a tip of the hat to the casting lead for putting these actors in these roles.Loved the noir-ish scenery, the pace of the movie, the dialog, acting, and (mostly) the music. Sometimes way too loud and heavy handed. At moments the soundtrack tended to dominate a scene rather than enhance the experience.The movie is long but interestingly, not too long. The story moves apace and has enough twists to keep me from getting too comfortable. It left me with questions that i thought would be answered and answered some that I didn't know I had. And (tiny spoiler) it was great to see the actor Edward James Olmos again, if only for a moment. Very highly recommended, especially if you've seen (and loved) the original.",8,3,10,15 October 2017
