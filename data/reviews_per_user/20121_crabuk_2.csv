Requiem for a Dream," I don't think I'd watch it again
","Now this is a difficult one and I think my rating may seem pretty harsh to some, considering how high it rates in the members poll. However, personally I just didn't enjoy it. The concept is great but I think it was taken a bit too far. I like controversy but I think the combination of how the film was shot, the themes and the score took it over the edge of what is enjoyable cinema and a piece that is intended to shock and leave the audience feeling stunned.For me Jennifer Connolly stole the show. Her role entails playing a confused but fundamentally good hearted girl that ends upon a situation that you wouldn't wish on anyone. I think the pain and emotion which is shown is nothing short of a masterpiece. If this was the only story in the film perhaps my opinion would be higher.However on the opposite scale Ellen Burstyns performance of a house wife who eventually goes mad due to an addiction of slimming pills is boarder line ridiculous. Apart from Gary oldman in Leon, probably one of the most overacted things I've ever seen.I could talk about the plot holes in this film all day long but ultimately those could be looked over if I was entertained and I'm not sure if I was.Give this a watch and make your own decision but definitely don't invite a date.",5,1,2,2 June 2013
