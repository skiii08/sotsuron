Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," dissapionting to say the least
","When i heard this film was out at the cinema,i booked my ticket just to see it, that's how desperate i was to watch it,but boy was i dissapionted,because there are so many faults in this film, like the very corny dialogue such as 'are you an angel'and other things such as how the characters talk about everything that could go wrong in their plans,and  the absolutly atracious acting by Jake Loyd, but  there are some good bits that redeem this film. 1: The best special effects ever to come out of Hollywood 2:The performances from Liam Neeson,Natalie Portman and Ewan Mcgregor plus Terence Stamp in a small but vital role as Chancellor Valoram 3:The breathtaking final scene which really pump's your blood. All in all a very average product.  ***(5)",Null,0,1,22 October 2001

","T2 rocks,it has all the ingrediants of a classic,,,suspense,great acting(Edward Furlong excluded)and directing,with special effects still state of the art after 10 years,all in all,better than the first film by half a star          T2*****",Null,0,0,6 October 2001
JFK," probably the most compelling story of JFK ever told

Total Recall," A great movie with blistering,jaw-dropping action
","COST(INFLATED):$100m GROSS:$182.6mThe thing that sets these movie apart from other action films is that is actually intelligent,with jaw hurting action,great special effects(for that time)and some really excellent fighting scenes(Racheal Ticotin and Sharon Stone anyone?)overall,arnie's second best feature(after T2) ****1/2(5)",Null,0,1,26 November 2001

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," RALPH'S VERY SHORT REVIEWS.
","DIRECTOR:George Lucas CAST:Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Alec Guiness, Carrie Fisher, and the voice of James Earl Jones. THE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SCI-FI FILM EVER MADE. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE FANTASTIC FOR THAT TIME(AND ON A VERY SMALL BUDGET). STAR WARS WAS 4 YEARS IN THE MAKING AND IT SHOWS. *****",Null,0,0,30 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," short reviews
","DIRECTOR:IRVIN KERSHNER CAST:MARK HAMILL, HARRISON FORD, CARRIE FISHER, BILLY DEE WILLIAMS, ALEC GUINESS, AND THE VOICES OF JAMES EARL JONES AND FRANK OZ.The best star wars ever, and believe me, no mean feat, with superb visual and special effects, with great performances(minus Hamill). All in all A great film that gets better with each viewing. *****",Null,0,1,30 May 2002
Back to the Future," great entertainment with great performances
",As in the Secret Of My Success Micheal J Fox gives a great performance in which is probably going to be his biggest box-office draw($210.6m)the only downside is Christopher Lloyd's hammy performence as the mad Doc Brown who is suitably annoying.  ****1/2(5),Null,0,1,19 October 2001
