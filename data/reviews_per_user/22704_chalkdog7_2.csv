Marie Antoinette," If the music director had at least been clever he would have had Cake perform the soundtrack.
","The costumes were beautiful. But they would have been just as beautiful on a poster, and I wouldn't have wasted an evening wading through this drivel. I spent much of the movie hoping Spiderman would rescue Kirsten Dunst, and me, from the remainder of the movie. It is possible that this movie was so bad that Sophia Coppola should not only be banned from making movies, she should be banned from watching movies.The main source of my disappointment with this film is the annoyingly anachronistic soundtrack. It was like some MTV producers got drunk,fell into a time machine, and vomited all over the eighteenth century. I'm not sure what the music director was trying to do, but it really made me long for the silent era. Here comes the spoiler (although the real spoiler associated with this film is the film itself.): I guess my real objection is that the film doesn't even show us Marie Antoinette marching off to the guillotine. I was really hoping to see the music director in line right behind her.",1,4,6,19 January 2008
Juno," If you can only see one movie...
","This is the only movie I have ever paid to see in the theater twice. What higher praise could there be? In a world full of dysfunctional relationships it is about time that Hollywood portrayed one that says 'it's okay to be a little bit screwed up.' This is an outstanding cast and a script that brings out the best of their talents. Top that off with an equally loopy soundtrack and you have a movie that is everything that a movie should be: entertainment with a heart and a giggle. I also have to say that Diablo Cody's acceptance speech at the Oscars was the best one I've seen. She deserved it, because she gave us a film that is destined to become a classic.",10,1,4,16 March 2008
