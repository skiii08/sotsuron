Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Veyr good, extremely violent
","Tarantino is once again at his strongest in this genre' of action and reaction movies. The martial arts fighting - absolutely essential to this genre' - I found to be believable (I know no martial arts - I'm just saying I was convinced the fighting was real). (Many times - MANY - times in scifi's the science is so loonie that there is no point in watching. Science is to scifi's as authentic looking fighting is to a Tarantino movie. However, the acting was unconvincing. I saw Ulma Thurman and knew it was her the whole time - same for the other actors. 8 out of 10....sans Michael Parks as 'Estabon' - I was mesmerized by this Spanish gentleman of leisure who scared me in my chair. I was scared - he was so calm and pleasant and yet there was a cauldron of aggression just sitting tranquilly waiting to be disturbed so it could explode ('esplode' as Estaban might say it) on another helpless human... Estabon scared me... THEN I saw the credits and thought to myself: 'It was Michael Parks?!?' He should win an Oscar for best actor! (I was amazed even more when the western style sheriff who investigates the Pine Church massacre in KB:V.1 turns out to be Parks as well.) Now if that range and depth of acting doesn't win an award... then the academy needs to reevaluate its assessment technique. Parks was brilliant! He was so good I thought that this guy is too real - he is too scary - he has got to be caste from off the street! Michael Parks gets a 20 out of 10; 4 thumbs up; A+++; major plus superlative kudos. I love this guy! He was so awesome!-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",8,3,6,27 May 2007
The New World," A Picture is worth a thousand words...
",... if you are ... old enough to know what the picture is saying.This is a story of two loves; a story of two worlds - how each clash and change. In the end it's the story of Pocahontas - the final scene makes the point.Wonderfully consistent story telling without the political psychobabble that all natives are noble and all whites are evil. Major major kudos to writer/director Terrence Malick. 10+/10-LDPS: apparently Terrence Malick gets it - how to tell an honest historical story while making it entertaining (this story was beautiful - I loved it) and not having to lie all over the place - e.g. 'Dances with Wolves.'_______________________________________________my faith = http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/,10,1,4,13 June 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Director's movie
","Excellent. Fantastic. This one, with Bruce Willis, is totally owned by the director. The story is very good, the whole movie is very good. But this one just shouts 'director' all over it. Wonderful editing and transitions as well as simile is used in this movie. Everyone in this is a wonderful actor - _even_ the bit players, yes even the bit players. There is nothing wrong with this movie.I thought it was going to be light entertainment, a little comedy, a little romance... see the movie. Solid hit.Bruce Willis delivers a flawless performance.Lucy Liu plays a 'doll' to the hilt. She is a doll in her own way, but here she is able to make her character sing her presence on the screen.And Josh Hartnett puts in a solid performance. I think he will be remembered for this one. (I remember him in 'The Faculty' which I liked. He was the hero and very convincing at that.) This is a good one - don't let the ads scare you away ... as I almost was. 10/10-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",10,3,6,13 October 2006
The Ring," Stupid ending ruins another possible great
","The first ending, where everything was resolved was great. The movie seemed great, I was ready to say 'great movie' 10/10. But then the second ending came along and made me feel nothing. This totally subverted the movie making it seem a mere trick of the director to frustrate the audience. 6/10.
All the symbolism became mere gimmickry. The movie led us down a clear and intelligently presented thread, only to abruptly change its course in the last few minutes. This is incredibly annoying. Oh wow, the ring is a ring - it has no ending... gee the symbolism! bleh. It left me feeling the way as the movie 'Adaptation,' which I thought was brilliant until the single/signal word 'kill' is uttered by the lead actress. It was so wrong and so forced and so awkward that it left me feeling nothing for the 'first' movie.-Zafoid",6,1,2,8 January 2004

Star Trek," Roddenberry's legacy trampled
","The opening was like OH MAN! and then it became soap opera pulp.Me and my friend are both TOS fans and agreed that TFB failed. (He said '... it was OK. No drama, all effects and then BOOM!'TFB:Kirk was an *** throughout the whole movieORIGINAL: was clever, and likableSpock was ... Spock 'lite'ORIGINAL: was clever, warm, lovable, and _real_Bones was too tall/large for re-creating McCoy kept spouting the original's lines like he was spitting out popcornORIGINAL: was well written, and lovableScotty was a clownORIGINAL: was clever, hard working, and charmingUhura was petulant, always angry, and self-importantORIGINAL: intelligent and sweetSulu was OK but 'SAMURAI' DOES NOT EQUAL 'fencing' (The writers clearly just copied and pasted these lines without thinking.)ORIGINAL: mysterious and seriousChekov was OK ... 17? gee, to whom are they pandering? HE DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL!!!ORIGINAL: was cool and funNow I see that there are three 'generations' of fans:Generation 1: TOS - the best ever none even came close. This is pure, un-pc-ified, un-soap-opera'd - the pure undistilled stuff right out of the bottleGeneration 2: DS9 - the politically correct fandom - banal pale and droll.Generation 3: TFB - the new breed of 'scifi soap opera' fans (scifi has become little more than soap operas in space: Big Brother meets Outer Space)I understand that TFB is a new timeline and that they wanted to break away from the original TOS and start new. But this movie was all glitter and gloss - like a woman's lipstick - superficial and empty. It has no heart.The Bottom Line: No one will ever be able to recreate Roddenberry's masterpiece. The chemistry between the crew of TOS was palpable. (Regardless of their off-stage relations) They portrayed a crew who respected and enjoyed working around each other. At the same time they were all _the_best_of_Starfleet_!So trying to re-create TOS is _impossible_. It would be like trying to re-create a Michelangelo or a VanGogh - once the original artist is gone all we have left to enjoy is what they left behind.Since TFB was not created by a genius, and definitely not created by even an artist, but instead created by a studio then this new version, wrapped in the ST icon, has now become nothing but a franchise. (see 'The Replacements')",3,9,16,30 May 2009
Fight Club," The Last Warrior
","This is beyond my ability to articulate since it is beyond my experience, but not beyond my ability to appreciate.Men are alienated. They need a purpose. In our growing technological society man's role is being diminished. He no longer is central to survival. ATM's, Computers, and even the internet has co-opted their sense of place. All is meaningless in this age convenience. Men have grown soft living off the fat of the land (pun intended).I usually comment separately about the different elements of the movie. But this time I won't because I would have to mention everything and I don't have the energy to list all the features of a movie. Indeed this movie is perfect in every aspect. 10+/10-ZafoidPS: now for the truth. Why is it, according to this movie, that men have to feel a sense of place and purpose? I choose to turn it around and say that the men who feel this way are those who only get a sense of purpose from working with their hands or tools or ... weapons. In this movie their hands are their weapons and thus their purpose - indeed *Fight Club*.So it is clear then that these men are dinosaurs and they are dying out. In reality this movie (and the book as well), is their death knell. Their last 'hurrah' to say 'we won the day' 'we conquered the enemy' (the enemy in this case is the technology which has displaced them - has co-opted their sense of purpose. Albeit their sense of purpose - that of conquest - is indeed misplaced outdated and no longer meaningful in a fully civilized and technological society. Indeed, we can thank God that we don't have to fear every breathing moment. Is this what they want? Yes. And so they are lost. But lost because of their misplaced projection of what life is about. It is not about conquest - it is about progress. Contributing with your mind and your heart your science and your art your time and your understanding. But these men can have none of that because they are trapped in their veltanschaung of 'survival of the fittest'. So be it, but progress has been going on since the dawn of man and it will not reverse. We have come from the age of sticks to the age of jets and we ain't going' back!) So let's give them a last 'hurrah' for they were once important they were once the center of the world they were once the makers of history - the makers of wars ... and nations. Bid them 'farewell' ('Fare thee well, good knight.') and once and for all recognize their last outcry - the last outcry of the last warrior.-Z",10,0,2,1 April 2006
Shaun of the Dead," A smashing good time!
","This movie is brilliant because of the many levels of emotions it covers: clever, different, intelligent, fun, moving, sad, hilarious, and thirsty - it made me want a pint! :) Shaun (well played by Simon Pegg) and his best friend, Ed (played hilariously by Nick Frost), are great together. Their chemistry is palpable. Shaun's love interest (a blonde - why are they always blonde?!?) does not do a good job convincing me that she is in love with Shaun. Her two friends accurately portray their relationship and also their relationship to Shaun.At the same time I loved Shaun's 'Mum' (played flawlessly by Penelope Wilton) Barbara who was so warm playing the sweet loving mother of her little boy. The entire remaining cast is excellent.I shouldn't forget all the extras who did such a fine job portraying the zombies. They were very well done with some good old zombie munching going on. 10/10-Zafoid",10,1,2,24 April 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," B Adventure surrounds excellent performance by Depp
","This is an excellently made movie except for the script. There is one pleasurable twist, but that is not enough to carry the already predictable plot. Also, there are many lines which detract from the adventure and make it almost as much a comedy. That's fine if done in moderation (in my opinion), but this is done to excess and makes the movie appear more as a kid's adventure flick than an attempt at making a story.This movie is only worth watching to see Depp's performance. Johnny Depp is superb as Capt. Jack Sparrow - utterly convincing. Yet the rest of the cast seems contrived and fail to carry any weight. They act as if this is a 'made for TV movie.' It could be the directing, but then how would one explain the same directing that Depp received?The mechanical special effects were ok (6/10), while the rest: production, lighting, photography were excellent(9/10) and the computer graphics were superb (10/10). They brought something new to computer graphics - well articulated skeletons as well as the immediate switching between body and bones in different light. Overall, in my opinion, the movie earned a 7/10.-ZafoidPS: A slight node to political correctness occurs in a few scenes thus downgrading the already flawed movie. Definitely see it for Depp.-Z",7,1,2,22 February 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Wonderful
","Simply wonderful. This is a child's fantasy wonderfully transfered to the big screen with big acting, directing, editing, production, costumes, and makeup. The cgi has come such a long way that the characters come to life... and let's not forget the voice actors who breath that life into those characters. It couldn't be done without them. All wonderful... simply wonderful family entertainment.-LDPS: It seems to me that finally Hollywood has caught on to the idea that good entertainment is good. It seemed to me that there was a time when one movie after another was made to depress and criticize everything ... as if there was an overall conspiracy of negativity that anything good is bad. And if you dared to make a movie that was about the good qualities in people, then you were ostracized by the industry.It seems to me that now that time is over. With such wonderful entertainment going on in this past decade (Shrek, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings - all three powerful solid movies each in their own right - etc etc) the movie industry has finally got it right. Make the movies you want - the ones that sell, the ones that don't - the ones that entertain the ones that don't. People will still flock to see them - b/c they are the movies.",10,1,2,22 May 2006
Happy Gilmore," Excellent Comedy
","Adam Sandler was extremely annoying on Saturday Night Live. However, his movie career has been an extremely pleasant surprise. You know a movie is good when years pass and people remind you of their favorite scenes. This (and others of Sandler's) is such a movie.He's no leading man, but the hockey rink scene with his love interest is very cute.<ul><li>Zafoid</li></ul>",9,1,1,28 January 2003
Madagascar," It's fun
","While not as entertaining as 'Monsters, Inc.' nor as fun as 'Ice Age,' 'Madagascar' is fun to watch and gives some very good laughs. Four animal friends live out their lives quite happily in the New York Central Park Zoo. They are: Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock), Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Melman the Giraffe (voiced by David Schwimmer (of 'Friends' fame)), and Gloria the hippopotamus (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith (married to Will Smith)).The Zebra desires to see the wild and so therein lies the plot. Marty gets out of the zoo and all 3 of his friends follow him into the streets of the city - and are caught by the humans in the main lobby of Grand Central Station ('It's grand, and it's central.' - yawn).They eventually get there, have some adventures, and have to make a decision. 8/10-ZafoidPS: the characters they meet in the wild are far more interesting and I kept wanting to see one of them, King Julien (voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen (of 'Da' Ali G' Show - who is brilliant) dominate the entire movie. (I hope Hollywood reads this and gets the idea to have a movie starring this wonderful character with Mr. Cohen doing the voice). ... In fact that entire sequence should be starred in a movie of its own.PPS: why is Ben Stiller given top billing when the movie spins around the character Marty and his issues. Is this politics or fear of racism if the lead character is African American? I don't know, but Chris Rock should get the top billing playing the TOP CHARACTER - the LEAD ROLE!!

Ice Age: The Meltdown," Good clean fun
","This time around the three we grew to love in 'Ice Age' come back just like the warm weather. New adventures and personal challenges await these three as they deal with the coming meltdown.All the same creativity is present in this story, but I found the story to be a bit thin. The squirrel (Scrat) makes many appearances which may have been used as filler. But since this character is such a charm to watch as he seeks his true love - the acorn - it is hardly a distraction but stands out as its own story line.Along the way new characters are introduced, including a female. In my opinion this usually ruins the original intent of the first movie. Fortunately this did not happen - although the strength of the first one is diminished by the introduction of a romantic theme. However, it is still in line with keeping this second story true and honest to its original heart-felt content. I was very happy to see no 'pc' correctness was imposed for social or economic reasons but instead just a plain old good piece of movie entertainment - similar to the first one.So apart from the thinness of the principle story (brought about by the requirement of a romantic theme) I gave this a 7 out of 10 (Not as good as the first one but still entertaining. If you could watch only one, then I recommend watching the first one over and over again.)-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",7,0,0,7 January 2007
The Fifth Element," Gets Better Everytime (2nd Comment)
","I can't help but comment on the perfection of this movie. I stick by my original comment. What I want to add is that this is a perfect classic scifi b/c it gets better each time I watch it. I must have seen it about 8 times now.Willis (as Korben Dallas), Tucker (as Ruby Rhod), and Gary Oldman (as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg) are equally brilliant super-nova actors. The rest of the caste is so perfectly chosen that any slight deviation would have weakened the movie noticably with an 'empty' spot sticking out in the middle.The production, set design, costumes, makeup (including the wounds received by all - note all! - even Korben's wounds in the following scenes are maintained giving Continuity a perfect record!), etc. are all the most exceptional I have ever seen in movie history.I use to think 'Forbidden Planet' was the best scifi ever made... maybe I have a new winner.<ul><li>Zafoid</li></ul>PS: Remember, God is love.<ul><li>Z</li></ul>",10,0,1,5 April 2003
The Fifth Element," Solid Bruce, Solid Action, Solid SciFi
","This is pure scifi. Nowadays all scifi's are either 'soap-operas in space' (e.g. Star Trek-TNG, Andromeda, Earth Final Conflict, etc.)or 'horror' movies (e.g. John Carpenter's 'The Thing,' and the 'Alien Bunch'). This one (like 'Lost in Space') had no message the director felt needed to be shoved down your apparently unenlightened throat. It was a movie that entertained from start to finish.Bruce is wonderful to watch even if he is only standing up against a wall and delivering a single line: 'That's a negatory, I am a meat-popsicle.' (Proof: this line has been quoted to, and by, me many times.) Bruce is great. If you are a scifi fan you should really like this one, and Bruce makes it better than ever.Chris Tucker is great as 'Ruby Rhod.' Watching his performance makes you realize how hard he must have worked to totally dedicate himself to playing this totally off the wall character. Kudos to Chris for a super job well-done. What I realized about his role was that I didn't keep thinking 'When is Bruce going to show up?' That's a major accomplishment since it is very hard to appear interesting up against a star like Bruce Willis. So the movie had a triple punch of great acting.Triple because I would be remiss if I didn't mention that 'Zorg' was *solidly* played by Leonard Gary Oldman. I was entranced by his stalwart singular focus mercenary/business man/genius. Just as interesting a character so as not to steal the show from anyone else nor make you long for another appearance from the others.This points to the great writing and directing - both allowed the characters to breath and develop without suffocating any other stars' roles. The production was very cool... I'm liking this movie even more now the more I describe it! :)Great scifi. Go see it.<ul><li>Zafoid</li></ul>",10,0,1,24 September 2002
That Thing You Do!," A Dream Caught on Film
","This is wonderful. You can't not like this movie. Well, you can, but you would have to have incredibly detailed and nit-picky reasons. I gave it an 8 out of 10 because I felt there were scenes that were forced. (I won't say since I don't want to include any spoilers. But I can say that I saw three scenes that seemed forced.)Tom Hanks shows up in a non-major role and does a splendid job of staying out of the way. I was really into the movie until he showed up. He played it level and remained there. It was cool. So I was able to sit back and forget he was TOM HANKS! - American FILM LEGEND!... *sigh*. (He should have kept regular people in all of the roles... it would have swept me away ... I would have started playing my Beatles albums again... yeeesh, did I say 'album'? WHAT's THAT??? hehehe :)Anyway, I enjoyed it and it definitely should have won an acting award, or at least an Oscar nod... 9/10PS: the end credits made me get over the 3rd of what I saw as a 'forced scene' and should get kudos for doing a great job - no bitterness to the very end.

Snatch," Perfect
","This movie is perfect in all its categories: credits, sound track, production, casting, writing, photography, editing, acting, and direction. 10/10.I was amazed with the freedom of the use of the camera. This movie will change the way movies are made. Slow-mo, stills, black and white, and color were all used to brilliant effect.I must pick out specific actors who were just over the top - meaning 10+!Jason Statham as 'Turkish' is simply superb - a star of very high caliber. (You should see him in anything he made, and read my comment about John Carpenter's movie: 'Ghosts of Mars.')Alan Ford as 'Brick Top' is terrifying - his forced speaking style made me think that he was chewing on the flesh of his previous victim.Vinnie Jones as 'Bullet Tooth Tony' is total tough head to foot tough - a walking brick wall - a marine for all seasons - none tougher.Brad Pitt as 'Mickey O'Neil' is utterly 110% convincing. I never liked Mr. Pitt's work before this - but this one totally sold me - he is as solid an actor as ever came out of Hollywood... and better!Finally, Guy Ritchie should be recognized as a Michelangelo of film.-LD",10,230,294,17 February 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Best Movie Ever Made
","I have often wondered what movie I would say was the best movie 'ever' made (I'm 55 and it's 12/29/06). So now I know - 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)' is, within my experience, the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE. It is so good it could be classified as a FILM. It is not dated.I also discovered what makes it so profound - every scene is perfect. Every detail is real ( = every 'pixel' of the screen is paid meticulous attention to and comes off as totally real). Every actor is well cast. Peter Sellers as The President, Dr. Strangelove, and the RAF Captain put in a performance that no actor has been able to match - ever. George C. Scott as Gen. Turdgeon, Keenan Winn as Col. 'Bat' Guano... the list goes on.This is the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE.-Zafoid",10,3,5,29 December 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Original, creative, Spanish!
","Let me explain my summary. When I was a photographer I paid attention to art. I visited many galleries and saw a pattern among all of the artists. Only the Spanish are original, individual, creative, and true to their heart (I am listening to del Toro's commentary and the word I am looking for is: integrity). I have to add this, the Canadian film industry is very similar in this way.Let me give you an example by contrast. When I was a photographer I visited an 'art party' in the village. While I was there I overheard the guy who invited me say to a group of his buddies: 'Well, we sold 150 paintings this week.' I was taken aback and said: 'Is this how success in art is measured?' Well, the group went silent and only starred at me. I waited for a reply - nothing. So I left feeling that art is dead - at least in their hearts ... and they're the artists! So now you know why I feel so strongly about the Spanish - their integrity to their heart.In my opinion, this movie is about violence and innocence coexisting in the world, and the fantasy created to escape the violence. (E.g. del Toro comments that he loves a 2 second shot in a short scene where Ofelia gets an exceedingly small victory - this small comment proves my point.) If you are bothered by subtitled movies you don't have to worry about following this one. It is graphically beautiful, visualizations dominate the script (but I did miss a few sentences - to no ill effect), and there is no way you won't enjoy this movie. 10+/10-LD_____________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",10,2,5,1 July 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Plot vs Sub-plot
","There are many disturbing things about this movie but the most annoying is the fact that the sub-plot dominates the plot. Or is it that the sub-plot is actually the plot? yes, that's it.The Plot: is supposed to be about a young woman 'Andrea' who has to make choices and how she deals with them.The Sub-Plot: is supposed to be about the fashion industry and how everyone deals with 'Andrea.' I am wrong - it is backwards. The plot that dominates is the fashion industry and all the 'glitz' that goes with it - the power, the sycophants, and the overlords. Well, the movie is called 'The Devil Wears Prada.' So the plot really is about the fashion industry of which 'Miranda' has made herself the leading character. (Meryl Streep once again does a great job making you forget she is Meryl Streep and making you believe she is totally her character, 'Miranda.')The plot that is ignorable is about a young woman who learns a lesson.Therefore, this movie glamorizes the superficial - no matter how much pain you go through... isn't it all so beautiful and aren't you all so beautiful, isn't life beautiful? 5/10-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",5,3,4,17 January 2007

I loved how I was terrified of the Thing and how I was encouraged by the heros. It was so excellent. There was real palpable anticipation in the original. It was done with intelligence and creativity.However, in today's world intelligence has been replaced by blood and creativity has been replaced by boobs. John Carpenter is no different (sans boobs). His lack of creativity is profound. His zeitwelt is typical of today: 'humans are evil and need to die.' I guess the movie is really a 'film noir' of man's place in the universe.I hated this movie.

Pitch Black," Best Film Noir SciFi Ever!
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was edgy without being sociopath. Vin Diesel brought the Riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels.I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (The snowmobile movie - oh yeah, it's called 'Triple-X,' or 'xXx' - was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black he plays an anti-hero to the max. I don't think you can go wrong when Vin stars in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood might type cast him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! I think the script for 'XXX' was weak for which Vin couldn't act down to it.Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - see it!-Zafoid",10,53,105,31 October 2004
Pitch Black," Pitch Black is Pitch Intense
","'Pitch Black' is incredible. For 99% of the movie you are held at the edge of your seat.

The rest of the cast does a fine job, but with Vin it's true intensity comes out.Mr. David Twohy's direction is excellent. All the pieces of a movie have to come together in order to male a film at this high of a caliber. But the direction of Mr. Twohy's and acting skill of Mr. Diesel stand out even above this.The music to cap the whole story at the end is in excellent sync with this movie.<ul><li>Zafoid</li></ul>PS: On a lighter side, Mr. Diesel does a stellar role in 'The Iron Giant' which I also highly recommend.

Little Miss Sunshine," Sun Shines on Little Miss Sunshine
","Wonderful surprise. A family is held together by anguish, angst, and ages. None of them like each other ... one hates all people. Then there is Olive, played perfectly by little miss sunshine, Abigail Breslin. If it wasn't for her this movie would be just depressing. Thus the title of the movie.Olive is the star of this movie. She is an utterly plane girl who is able to show her family by her ways (i.e. Ms. Breslin's acting) that the sun shines from within - not from without. She wants to compete in the beauty pageant 'Little Miss Sunshine.' She is allowed to enter and yet the family can't afford to send her with Mom. So they all decide to go for a drive ... from New Mexico. So up loads the family into the VW bus: Dad, Mom, grumpy old grandpa, uncle, older brother, and Olive. 9/10Ms. Abigail Breslin as 'Olive' - perfect perfect perfectMr. Greg Kinnear as 'Richard' (Dad) - he CAN act! and well too!Mr. Paul Dano as 'Dwayne' (older brother)Mr. Alan Arkin as 'Grandpa'Ms. Toni Collette as 'Sheryl' (Mom)Mr. Steve Carell as 'Frank' (uncle) - such a performance should get him an Oscar nod for this one.-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",9,0,4,21 January 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not Bad

","Good story, excellent action, interesting scifi. Will Smith does not disappoint. This is very entertaining - almost as good as the movie 'Lost in Space' which I liked b/c of it's pure entertainment scifi and non-spoiled plot.The reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is that it was slow for me in the middle. But suddenly it took off like a rocket ship into action. And boy was I surprised! :) The robots, the city-scape, the special effects are done very well. They add to the whole movie.The ending was very good which I am happy about. So many scifi's fall to the director's agenda to spill out their own point of view thereby spoiling the entire movie. This one will not disappoint. It is great entertainment plain and simple. 9/10-ZafoidPS: now for my opinion of robots. They will never be sentient beings - they will never achieve consciousness - the one thing that makes us human.

Jarhead," Jarhead: One Man's Story
","I liked this even after reading comments about how it is anti-Marine. It isn't. It's about one person's growth into becoming a Marine. He starts out as a 'dickhead' - he didn't get it - he didn't get the very training he signed up for. But time passes and he starts to get it. He starts to be a Marine.The thing that impressed me the most is its neutral narrative of each guy in the outfit. One is a loving husband, one is a real hump (a--hole), one is a total JARHEAD, one is a goof, another is level headed... ya' know, I liked this film. It was ... it had a 'real' quality to it but without being the 'REAL TV IN YOUR FACE' kind of pap they show on commercial television.Oh, about the negative comments: the negative comments about this film focus on a scene where the Marines are bored. But the whole movie neither tries to disgrace these young men nor tries to make them out to be super-heroes. It tells a story, in plain text - neither BOLD nor italic, neither all caps nor underscored, and best of all, it's neither left nor right... it's about one young man and his growth into becoming a Marine... ya' know? I liked this film. 9/10-ZafoidPS: I have to explain something: I am a Bible believing Christian, and I do not support any war any time any where on any side - God said 'Thou shall not kill.' and that's the end of it. So by saying 'I liked this film.' I am saying that I liked this film - period. So please don't think I am telling you to go join the military or anything like that. This was a story - it's like a story you would read in a book. I read it and I liked the story. It was entertaining and well done.

Independence Day," ( 4 + 10 ) / 2 = 7
","Now (7/6/03) I have realized that there are two scales by which to judge a movie. They are: 1) did it entertain?, and 2) is it a good story? These two are independent and so a movie can be a mix of any degree of each.[1] did ID entertain? You bet. 10/10. [2] is it a good story? No way. 4/10.So I gave it a 7 for the average. This may turn out to be a good way to judge a movie. Afterall 7/10 is not a bad score. It says the movie is worth a watch, but at home, rented, or on commercial TV.ID was very entertaining... just leave your intellect at the door and have a ripping good time. If you don't you're going to have a lousy time and what's the use in that... and besides, don't we all like to be entertained?-ZafoidBTW, if the movie didn't entertain, and say received a score of 4/10, then the average would be 4 which would say that the movie is a total waste of time. On the flip side if it was also a good story and received a 10/10 for the story as well, then the average would be 10 making the movie a keeper!I like my new system. I realized it after reading several other comments, some quite vitriolic and some focusing on the fun they had just watching it. So this seems to work well since it allows a hollow movie to still be worth a view and not have it buried b/c the 'intellectuals'' brains weren't stimulated enough for them to say 'cheers.'In conclusion I give all the glory to God for allowing me to realize this delineation... in Jesus' name, amen.-Z",7,0,1,6 July 2003
Batman Begins," Batman Begins is Batman Reborn! Wonderful!
","I never did like Batman since I was a kid. (Morgan Freeman is a big fan of Batman the comic.) The previous movies were good and I enjoyed them - the character was made more realistic. The characters were not 2 dimensional. This is not just an action-adventure. This movie, in my opinion, brought the character of Batman up into the realm of drama. The chase scene seemed so real. The reaction of the cops seemed so real - as if unacted. (I found out watching the 'after movie' info, that the director, Christopher Nolan, wanted this movie to be realistic - it WAS!) The entire movie is flawless. I will watch this one again and again.I first saw Christian Bale in 'American Psycho' - I said I will never watch another movie with that guy in it (b/c of the role - not b/c of him). Once again I get to eat my own words and prove that I am an idiot. Mr. Bale went beyond the simple 2 dimensional image of Batman portrayed by Michael Keaton (Batman Returns - did a great job) and George Clooney (Batman & Robin - did a great job) and Val Kilmer (Batman Forever - did a great job). But Mr. Bale is able to not only act like the superhero, but is able to _act_ as a fool equally convincing. Wonderful is the operative word. I look forward to other movies starring Mr. Bale.Now to the 'supporting' cast. I have never seen a movie so loaded with great actors in the supporting roles. HOLY MACERAL BATMAN - IT'S MORGAN FREEMAN!!! Michael Caine as Alfred?!? Liam Neeson as a villain?!? Gary Oldman as Gordon?!?!? (he was brilliant as Jean-Baptiste Emanuel ZORG! - I watch the Fifth Element every time it's on TV... there's a website devoted to the Zorg character. Oldman totally rocked in that movie - as did (of course) Bruce Willis and equally wonderful Chris Tucker!) Rutger Hauer as Earle?!? man o' man - did the talent train crash on this set or what?!?

28 Days Later...," Excellent British Flick
","Similar to other zombie movies this is a new and very interesting version. So much so I think of it as original. The British films which make it across the pond are always ones with a much better grip on reality while telling a story.An example of this is the alternate ending seen after the credits (on cable). I thought the alternate ending was going to be such a break from the thread of the story that it was going to ruin the entire movie. It didn't. In fact it was indeed the very ending I expected.The overall feel is that of an 'artsy' film - which scared me, but my fears were delayed when i saw the movie actually had plot, any 'shaky' camera scenes were made very subtely, and I never felt bored. Great directing, acting, lighting, makeup, production, etc. The whole nine yards excellent. 10/10-Zafoid",10,1,2,10 January 2004
Cars," Solid entertainment through and through
","There is much to say against Hollywood these days, but this one reminded me of the old Disney when they were trend setters and everyone jumped to their beat. Pixar did Disney proud with an amazing cgi job that completely sets you at easy forgetting these are only animations. Some times they would let this illusion slip and you were reminded this is only an animation, but then the story was so strong and well done that that didn't bother me at all.Before the movie started I thought this was going to be a typical 'here's a mature cartoon - watch as everyone learns a lesson and has fun doing it' animation. But I was wrong. Then once it started I thought that it was going to be 'fast car learns a lesson'. But I was wrong. After a while the movie made me drop my predispositions and I realized that this one is not just good, not just a cut above the rest... it was great!This is rock solid entertainment for everyone. 10+/10... way to go Disney and Pixar!-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",10,0,0,9 January 2007
Ghost Rider," All Cage
","I watched this with some hopes of it being a great movie... my mistake. The movie starts out with some history of how the rider becomes a ghost rider. That's all well and good, but there was too much history. In my opinion much of it could have been cut out. On top of that I felt absolutely no connection between the actors. I was hoping for Cage to show up asap. He didn't - not his fault.Nicholas Cage saved the movie. It would have been a B rated flick at best without the monumental ability for Cage to fill the entire big screen and carry the entire script. NOTE: I didn't say 'carry the entire cast' b/c Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott, Brett Cullen and Donal Logue all did fantastic jobs in their respective roles. They just weren't melded together well.Wes Bentley, as Blackheart, seemed at home in this role. But I was glad that he wore a scarf to cover his chest - if the chest was open then the entire movie would have seemed cheap. Matt Long only has talent for soap operas. (Then again Jack Nicholson was the worst actor ever when he started out, so ...)Eva Mendes totally belongs on a romantic comedy set. The little snippets where she gets to perform a bit of comedy made me 'fall in love with her.' She pwns romantic comedy. NOTE: Raquel Alessi is not related to her in any way - other than she looks like Eva's sister! I thought she loved Johnny more than her older character played by Eva.The cgi of the skull on Cage's shoulders was well done when he spoke, but it looked awkward in place. However, the flames were awesome.Overall I only give the movie a 7 out of 10.-LD____________________________________________my faith: http://ww.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/PS: I rented the DVD from NETFLIX and got to listen to the producer's (Gary Foster) commentary.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Doesn't disappoint
","I don't get it - how is it that a sequel is as good as the original? Well, regardless, this is. Milo Jojovich once again rocks as the awesome fighter of 'resident evil.' NOTE: this is no small accomplishment. I always have to explain how Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy and 7 of 9, played by Jerry Ryan were brought to life by those respective actors.Take for example Tuvoc in Start Trek: Voyager, or the lead blonde detective in 'Escape from Mars.' Both of these actors were stiff and therefore unconvincing. (Perhaps your examples would be different, but the point is the same - it is the ACTOR who brings the character to life - not the direction, editing, set, costumes, make-up, etc. - it all comes down to acting.)Milo Jojovich is a great actress for this part. Utterly convincing in every detail she commits acts of martial arts that even I, a great skeptic of females knocking over 200# soldiers - believes. (Another example is the brunette in this movie who is like Milo's character in RE I. She is not convincing at all and throws the movie off.) The other supporting actors fare well in this movie. But let's face it - it's all Milo.This movie delivers and doesn't disappoint. In fact when it ends they leave me wanting to see RE 3!9/10 (The 9 is for other things having nothing to do with Milo.)-Zafoid",9,0,3,27 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Tim Burton - Strong as Ever
","The last Tim Burton movie I saw was that mess about monkeys, a planet, and an astronaut who needed flying lessons. Yuck. 1/10. But with this movie Mr. Burton has returned to the inventive, and singularly genius vision that is uniquely his. Wonderful.What added to his great vision is the cast! All exceptional. There was one miss - Helena Bonham Carter* as Mrs. Bucket. I knew she didn't fit. The rest of the family seemed so warm and charming, yet Ms. Carter so harsh cold and distant. But she had a very small part and hurt the movie only slightly.Deep Roy was wonderful - he played his part according to the direction - perfectly. Mr. Burton's decision to 'clone' Mr. Roy as all of the Oompa Loompa was a great idea, and the tunes were really wonderful. (I hated the original 'Wonka' movie - it was so annoying and 'old.') But I really enjoyed these dance numbers performed by the 'cloned' Mr. Roy.As I have always said, to make a great movie, everything has to be great - crew cast director and production.Here's a big kudo out to the cast - if I could Iwould throw them all a big cast party! :)Christopher Lee ....

Big Fish," Touching for Fathers and Sons
","I never knew my dad. He was only a distant childhood memory. I know he got angry at me once and I remember kissing him on the cheek. Why am I mentioning this? Because it's only pertinent to me and it will (maybe not) touch those of you out there in similar situations. And so this movie goes. It was so slow at one point I started playing my computer game (Q3A).This is a personal story between a specific son and his father... one which you can only get involved in if you lived through it. And so this is the movie's weakness - it doesn't draw you in. I was tempted to call this a 'chick flick' b/c of it's almost sentimental feel, but in the end the movie pulled together making it not that bad to see for fathers and sons. 8/10Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi light up the big screen when they appear.-Zafoid",8,1,1,1 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Slower than the others
","I found this installment of the Harry Potter movies to be quite slow throughout the whole movie. Sure there were exciting bits, but not overall. I think if you added up the time actors were speaking and the time they were not, you would find a 50/50 split. The lack of action also made this movie seem like just one more installment.My suspicion was correct - the director has been changed. The other installments in the story of Harry Potter were fast paced, loaded with charm, excitement, interesting, and fun. This one verges on being brooding droll and annoying. I was hoping this would change with the next (last?) installment but alas no - the same director of 'Order of the Phoenix' is directing 'Half-Blood Prince' - what a shame. Here I was just thinking that this is the only series of movies to go into history as maintaining a solid entertainment line, but alas no.Amazingly everything else is absolutely the same strong entertainment as before (from production to acting), except for the very weak action line. It is so poor it drags the whole movie down _for me_. I couldn't wait until it was over.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' aka 'Dawn of the Dead'
","This is a movie about modern relationships. Joel Barish (Carrey) meets a messed up girl who turns his world around and then they break up. However in this world the break ups can be made permanent by having your memory wiped of that person.This speaks volumes about the weakness of the modern human. People are rapidly becoming pale superficial material empty self-serving sociopath mannequins of what humans once were. Once upon a time character mattered; today it is laughed at.This movie's answer to the question: 'do you want who you are and the experiences that have made you, erased?' is indefatigably 'YES!' If we can have anything we want, and the thought of removing painful memories from our lives is considered a blessing, then we are no longer humans - just 'evolved' neurological impulses.This movie is not about relationships. In essence it is about people's own inability to be human. They refuse to live life with painful memories -in essence they refuse to live. They want fast food memories and that's OK. I use to think zombies didn't exist... nonetheless it is well done. 8/10-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/PS: the Bible says that in the end, people will be lovers of themselves, but with no love in them.

There's Something About Mary," There's Nothing About Mary
","I found this movie to be incredibly boring. In short it has very few funny moments. Here are the three: the zipper scene, the dog-on-fire scene, and the 'speed for the dog' scene. However, the 'speed' scene has a great setup (Evans and Dillon set the dog up to meet Stiller), but in it's punchline it goes flat. Don't see this movie if you want to laugh.There is a scene in Mary's office with Tucker (Lee Evans) on crutches. But I kept feeling that the director was saying: 'look at this, isn't it outrageous?!' It felt forced. Mary (Diaz) tries to help and there was one more quantifiable laugh. The man (played adeptly by Lee Evans)leaves and outside is a good chuckle, indicating his slapstick skill.This humor is not offensive. It is you who are pseudo-sensitive if you think it is. E.g. the character 'Carla' in 'Cheers' was the most insulting image of an Italian-American woman I have ever see. However, she did not represent all Italians, all Italian women, or women in general. She was one character and her antics were about her character. No Italian-Americans were upset about 'Carla' - we all had a great laugh. In this same sense, the humor about the crutches is not at all about people with handicaps - it is about 'Tucker' and that's all it is. So get over yourselves, get a life, and learn to 'Eat, drink, and be merry.' (Luke 12:19)Cameron Diaz is a charm to watch, but that's it. I wanted to laugh and all I did was wound up waiting to think of something better to do.Matt Dillon is excellent at being a 'mook.' (I guess that means big dork.)Lee Evans puts in a solid and utterly convincing performance.However, the story is simply not funny and not romantic. I feel nothing between Ted (Stiller) and Mary (Diaz). Towards the end I kept thinking, 'Come on, END! (so I could go do something fun.)'In short, there's NOTHING about 'There's Something about Mary.' 5/10<ul><li>Zafoid</li></ul>PS: This movie could be renamed: 'There's Something About Cameron.'<ul><li>Z</li></ul>",5,0,1,19 January 2003
The Last Samurai," Appearance of Cruise ruins a perfect movie
","This is as close you could come to making a perfect movie as you could and get a miss.Tom Cruise is a great movie star. I enjoyed him in 'Top Gun.' But he is not up to this part - it is too difficult for him to play against a backdrop of the most beautiful and rich culture on the planet!That's the way it is portrayed. Fine, it's a movie - they can say whatever they want - evil white devils corrupting innocent noble 'savages' once again. yawn.... great freakin' movie though! was I entertained? was i moved? was i caught up in the action? was it beautiful to look at - there were scenes where I thought my eyes were literally drinking up the images... i could almost taste the 'water' with my eyes.In my opinion getting a 'metrosexual' guy like TC instead of a man, like Kirk Douglas (I know) weakened this _entertaining_beautiful_emotion-packed_action-packed_rich-dialog_even-richer-culture_ movie from being a 10+/10 to a 9/10.Lose Cruise and you got a movie that was made for the ages... now all u got is a movie made for certain ages... like 13 yr. olds :/-ZafoidPS: if u don't believe me look at the original '7 Samurai' - how many pretty faces are in that?

The Da Vinci Code," Silliness
","I am a Bible believing Christian and this one attempt to de-throne God by placing the woman above Him is as old as Lucifer's rebellion against God.First off the movie didn't strike me as interesting from a fictional point of view. Perhaps it was badly told, perhaps the movie is never as good as the book (so many details are left out due to lack of time etc.), perhaps the line of reasoning is thin to begin with, or just perhaps it is b/c I do not find mysteries interesting. (I saw 'National Treasure' and thought that was slightly more interesting than this.)\It also struck me that there was one point which seemed to validate my impression. E.g. throughout the movie they try to make Christ only a man. So OK, if He is only a man (He isn't of course), then why is the woman being worshiped... then why did the woman try to walk on water?? I think I just gave myself enough evidence which proves my initial claim - this is an attempt to de-throne God and replace Him with the woman.

Nonetheless, with the help of his friends, he manages to overcome evil's attempt to destroy him and all he knows as good.Ms. Rowling has a gift to keep the story moving, just as the producers and director have a gift for keeping the movie on the same high standard as the original. If they keep this up much longer it will go down in history breaking all records at the box office.The unfortunate thing about this series, and perhaps especially this one installment, is that they are trying to sell you the idea that 'magic works.' How unfortunate. All I can say is that I hope God opens your eyes so that you too may have the hope of faith in Christ.Excellent entertaining movie just like the first.-Zafoid PS: I saw this on cable and then got to see 'Movies that Pop' which shows explanations and 'backstage' information about the exciting scenes.

A Beautiful Mind," Brilliant Crowe
","This movie is a true story about Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. What is remarkable about Dr. Nash, besides him being a mathematical genius, nobel laureate, and Fields Medal Recipient, is that he also suffers, unbeknownst to him, from 'paranoid schizophrenia.'Mr. Crowe does an exceptional job of acting as the tormented Dr. Nash, a man who is remarkable at recognizing patterns. In order to understand the scale to which Mr. Crowe can act one should first see 'GLADIATOR' and then 'A Beautiful Mind.' Having seen both and not recognizing Mr. Crowe in the later makes his ability as an actor stand out above anyone in current residence at Hollywood. 10/10",10,0,2,28 April 2003
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Not ... Good?
","Jack Black is burying his tremendous talent and substituting this stupid iconoclastic comedy which is beneath his talent level. There is a deeper better more talented JB inside that he won't let out. He could sky rocket above the well-skilled and professional talent of Silent Bob to become an American Master, but instead he decides to roll around in the mud with all the little piggies swilling farts and feigning sarcastic-satanic worship.I think his movie is about how Rock evolved into Garage Band evolved into Garbage Band evolved into Tenacious D. What a shame, they both play the guitar so well yet they waste it on this.I admit I did laugh very hard at three times in the movie, so I was generous and gave it a 5 out of 10.-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",5,1,5,17 April 2007
War of the Worlds," No Drama Whatsoever - Emotionless
","This is a monumental waste of $3.95. I kept watching this movie waiting to feel something... nothing. Spielberg has (long) lost his touch for drama! The ending was a relief. Some scenes are very faithful to the original. (It didn't have to be - it just had to be a good movie, but it wasn't even that.) There are nods to other scifi's like Godzilla - but Spielberg had to borrow the drama in that scene to get some drama into his own. As I said, he's definitely lost his touch.((In fact if you watch the original you FEEL something - you will care about the characters, the people, the city, THE WORLD! You will fear the aliens... etc. Watch the original. It will become - if it hasn't already - an American classic. This thing will be forgotten next season. I'll never watch it again.))While watching this I thought to myself: 'Tom Cruise cannot act - at all!' And then I thought... 'well, how do I know that?' I knew I needed some piece of evidence to prove my point.THEN Tim Robbins appeared (he plays 'Harlan Ogilvy'). I immediately saw what a real actor can do with any role. I use to think I could act ... seemed pretty easy. No way - no how. Watch Tim Robbins. THAT'S ACTING! Mr. Robbins made me forget he is Tim Robbins... Mr. Cruise ... well, he is very attractive.((PS: about Mr. Cruise at this point: during the movie in my heart I groaned 'has he done anything that is good/worth watching?' and after the movie ... I channel surfed and saw 'Jerry McGuire.' He was good in that. But if you watch the 'money' scene, you will see that his heart (ironic - like the footballer he is an agent for), is not in it. Nonetheless, when that is on I usually watch it because it is a good movie, sans Mr. Cruise in the leading role.))_Double_major_props_ (kudos) to the special effects crew! Holy mackerel! Special Effects will rule scifi movies from now on. Since there are no talented scifi directors anymore (Kubrik blew us away with '2001: A Space Odyssey') no one has a sense of drama, then no one will be around to make the movie worth watching - sans the special effects crew.Which reminds me of a 100% computer animated 'special effects' movie worth watching: 'Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within' (get past the 'gaia' psychobabble and you'll be OK.) I 'predict' that one day CGI will rule the entertainment world! (NOTE: 'Ark' is not as good as... hec, it doesn't even come close to 'FF:TSW' but it is all CGI and is a good watch. (The animation on the people is so weak that it detracts from being any better than just a good watch.)Back to 'War of the Worlds' - Steven Spielberg ... I don't like his movies anymore or ever since 'Raiders' and 'Close Encounters.' (Did you see his 'AI'? - all unemotional detached meaningless empty ennui pap - bleh. I couldn't care less for all the characters and care even less for this movie. I started to read the short story this is based upon... totally not like the movie and almost as boring, but a better read than the movie is a watch. Rent/buy 'Caddy Shack'!) Why is this movie so unemotional? I think it's b/c it's 2005 - I mean it's just a sign of the times - modern man and all that.What I am trying to say is that the Bible says that in the end (meaning when the Lord is getting ready to return) people will be lovers of themselves, but have no love in them. So this to me is a sign of the beginning of the end. People are just too withdrawn from reality; breast fed on the TV signal from birth till death people have lost touch with what it means to be alive. Now they only go to the movies. I remember seeing a few times ... on TV ... when a newscaster asked a local witness about something that just happened: 'how did you feel?' they reply: 'you know, like that time in that (movie).'It isn't the movies, it isn't even Hollywood - it's people. Did the TV turn itself on? No, we all did. I watch fewer and fewer TV shows nowadays. I watch movies and the Discovery Channel. Maybe one day I will have the strength to turn it all off and just listen to the wind. ...funny, and I use to laugh at 'country folk.' May God teach us all His ways... in Jesus name, amen.-ZafoidPS: 1/10 (since there are no negative scores)-Z",1,2,4,12 January 2006
Ice Age," Excellent characters
","This movie is not plot heavy. It's really about the characters - who they are, how they interact with each other, and what their goals are. Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Saber toothed Tiger are the protectors of a child who they received rather surreptitiously... well Manny and Sid have, but Diego has a somewhat different idea.So all three head out to find the 'herd' of humans to which this baby belongs. The baby is very quiet, happy, and very brave - a rare combination in any human. Regardless of this idealization (like talking, conscious animals are not?) all four are very well played out and voice acted (yes, even the baby has to be voice acted) that you feel that they are real and not animated. That's the success of this movie - since it is character heavy, then the characters must become real to the audience or else it would fail. Well it is a marvelous movie that kids of every age can appreciate and relate to in some way.One extra nod to John Leguizamo for his voice acting of Sid - who steals most of the scenes without being overbearing.There is one thing wrong with this movie - it's too short. :) 9/10-LD___________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",9,0,0,18 August 2007
Con Air," Solid and Tense Entertainment
",Like a roller coaster you love to ride it makes you clench your teeth and scream... for more. This is solid entertainment. I am surprised at how many times I have _re-watched_ this action thriller. When I first saw it I liked it and all. At first I thought it was just 'ok' but after a while I started to see the details and the intricacy of the action and the tension.Add to that the few (tastefully done) moments with humor. E.g. the Corvette and how to define irony. You will laugh out loud - if briefly - because Nicolas Cage's acting brings you right back to the action. 8/10-Zafoid,8,0,1,2 April 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Second half found funny bone
","This is a weak attempt by yet another not funny SNL crew member. Except for the team of David Spade and the late Chris Farley SNL has produced singularly unfunny comedians. The show is still on because people no longer have a sense of humor.'Anchorman' started off slow and stayed there until the last half-hour. Some writer must have been imported from another planet because the people on this one don't get it anymore.While the jokes were good in this funny half-hour (I saw this on On-Demand so I rewound the movie to see one joke again. It was so funny I had to stop writing this comment for a moment in order to have another laugh at it.) it wasn't enough to save the show from it's already dated humor. Everything was forced - from the poses to Christine Appelgates attempt at looking beautiful.Lastly, to ruin any respect it may have earned, it insults the Republicans - standard fair for millionaire socialists in this country.-Zafoid",6,0,1,8 April 2005
Lord of War," Smart and Beautiful
","Nicolas Cage is totally up to this character, unfortunately his narrative isn't.I use to think that voice acting was the easiest of all the acting jobs. It isn't. The actor must bring the character to life through their voice alone. Nicolas Cage does not deliver on this single point. However, the entire movie, and Cage's performance, is so well done that it doesn't damage the value of the movie very much (10/10 -> 9/10).His commentary is very dry but not sociopathic or detached as the main character (Yuriy) is supposed to be. But for the rest of the movie he is totally convincing and a real joy to watch flawlessly making this character real... which later you find out... well, let me just say that you learn things you never hear about on the 6 o'clock news.The photography and juxtaposition of the scenes and images is exceptionally well done. It strengthened the movie in a 'smart' way. I felt as if I was reading (and most definitely enjoying) a think tank's paper on gun runners. 9/10-Zafoid",9,1,3,4 March 2006
Trainspotting," Well done - very real ...
","... except for the parents. They were too good to believe. I had one parent that was helpful and all, the other one was insulting and demeaning. He was soon gone and the last male parental unit I had bordered on abusive. So let's get real - the Renton's were just too good to believe - for any home.The scene where the mother (see the movie) is over the top _imo_. I mean sure the reaction makes sense, but not that much.The blokes who did their crimes and stuff were excellent. I felt a chemistry between the actors that is rare to see in a film (exceptions: Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings don't have that chemistry but are still great movies).Other than those two small points I think that this is a movie worth watching by every adult. 9/10-LD__________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",9,1,1,25 September 2007
Signs," Which type are you?
","PLOT SPOILER/EXPLANATIONThe whole point of this movie is what kind of person you are. According to Shyamalan there are two kinds of people. It is about which of the two kinds of person *YOU* are. If you see something you can't explain - is it due to some divine intervention, or to mere coincidence? The 'coincidence' people live by fear; the 'something more' live by hope.So this movie is not about aliens with ray guns who dissintegrate people and mankind fighting back to save the earth from total destruction. (Although there is a hint of that throughout the movie.) You end up having to assess all these events - whether they are crop circles or some such yet unexplained phenomena.The lead character in the movie, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) makes his decision. His wife died in a horrible accident only later... (see the movie).While the movie is slow (because misleading advertising made it seem like another 'War of the Worlds' action adventure movie) it isn't if you buy into the low-budget reality that this Shyamalan attempts here. 8/10.<ul><li>Zafoid</li></ul>PS: I came to faith not by signs - but by the realization that Christ *IS* real. After trying all other things, and feeling utterly empty, I came to accept Christ in my heart.

Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.''Numbers 6:24-26'The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you; the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace.' ...in Jesus' name, amen.<ul><li>Z</li></ul>",Null,0,3,15 March 2003
Beowulf," Hold on - it won't let you go!
","Phenomenal. Wonderful. An epic hero is brought to life in Zemekis' cgi project. If you like stories where the hero is gritty, powerful, strong, dynamic, and ... heroic. Such other movies as '300', and 'The 13th Warrior' (ok, the Vikings) then you will LOVE this movie.I saw 'Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within' and lauded over the cgi. This one is on a fairly equal par in that area, but this story, the way Zemekis spun it, is so freaking wonderful that I think this movie has heralded the end of the 'pretty boy Hollywood' actor.I mean let's face it, all the modern (2010) male actors are metro-sexuals. How can you possibly cast those guys in a role as powerful and dynamic as BEOWULF! You can't and Zemekis, the talent that he is, didn't - to the everyone's enjoyment and advantage.So if you love strong heroes told in epic stories in a powerful way - aka ENTERTAINMENT - then you'll love B:tDC. 10*",10,2,5,14 January 2010

","This is yet another, albeit predictable, movie about a group of people who want to be respected like everyone else. (See 'Revenge of the Nerds.') This movie is about verve and good cheer for all the mentally challenged people who have to deal with us 'normies.' Although the story revolves around a 'jackass' in the end it's really about those people who are able to overcome their handicap - us. The real Rainman said: 'You don't have to do anything to be special... we are all special.' (paraphrased)Indeed these mentally challenged people show us that being 'special' does not mean you are different - we are all the same part of the human species. The funny lines are all delivered by the the handicap members of the crew.Now here's the amazing thing: no one respects anybody - in this day and age people are the most rude, vulgar, impolite, and sociopathic I have ever seen.

300," Brilliant 'Come to Life' Graphic Novel
","With many scenes from the novel included in this movie, the fans of the original graphic novel are sure not to be disappointed. Unfortunately there are people who aren't blessed with any logic who say: 1) this is a right-wing propaganda movie (meanwhile the entire news industry has been loaded with left-wingers, and most of Hollywood is all liberal, but that's OK) 2) this movie is about freedom vs darkness and tyranny - and these people are against freedom? They are all hypocrites and have no logic. Ignore them and see this movie - it is sure to entertain you.Gerald Butler does a fantastic job as the king of the Spartans - bringing him to life - as does many of the other actors. Zack Snyder did a great job directing this movie and bringing all of the elements into your lap. This is a great flick. I loved the graphic nature of it - so well done with CGI filling in many places and you would never know it. What a ride! 10 out of 10.-LDPS: I just saw Pathfinder before this and felt nothing for any of the characters as they failed to bring them to life. Pathfinder is definitely well made, and from the director's commentary, achieved everything he was going for ... except making you care about the characters._______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",10,3,6,8 August 2007
Fantastic Four," Plot need a thickener
","Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic, the leader of the four), Jessica Alba as Sue Storm (The Invisible Girl), Chris Evans as Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm (The Thing) and Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom (Dr. Doom) did a great job with a slack script. However, Chris Evans had the cool character and played him flawlessly and Michael Chiklis, who wore a thick body suit, played his character with so much feeling that you could sense his pain, sorrow, and happiness. The top applause should go to Mr. Chiklis.I am not a fan of the Fantastic Four. When I was a kid I tried to read the comic books but it never caught my interest - neither did Spiderman. The hero's I liked the best were the Green Lantern (the original only), Superman (who doesn't?), and Captain America. So I wasn't a fan, but this movie seemed to me to be true to the original characters and the theme of the comics. I also really enjoyed how they adeptly brought the characters into the 21st century.The special effects were excellent, and the Four's interaction was well played. 8/10.-Zafoid",8,0,1,20 January 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Weak Ending ruined a Brilliant Comedy
","I saw this after it appeared in the theaters. It was funny then and it's still funny today (Jan. 2006). NOTE: in my opinion, the Monty Python's Flying Circus skits on TV are dated and rarely funny any more.But this movie (MPatHG)... when I read the quotes on IMDb.com 'Famous Quote' page I started laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. It is just as funny as it was when it was first distributed. Keep in mind I went there only to find one quote and ended up reading most of the entire page! I suppose that these lines hold up b/c the grail myth will always be in our (western) culture. So be it... I'll take the laughs anytime. :)As to the lousy weak horrible ending ... what can I say? It was horrible! Like a huge horrible thing that won't go away! I can only wonder if they were in a rush to finish the movie so it could be distributed in a timely basis - you know - like distributing 'santa claus' movies in mid-summer - it wouldn't work! If you can get past the ending ... and you can't ... you will still love this classic tale told by the MPFC crew. 9/10-Zafoid",9,0,1,20 January 2006
Sin City," Great Comic Book; Horrible Movie
","John Carpenter must have taken lessons from Frank Miller. Gory-er sex; bloody mess; torture, perpetual killings, decapitation and castration abound in this blood lust movie.They tried too hard to make this 2D classic turn 3D. They failed miserably. They failed because they didn't succeed to bring the 2D characters into a 3D world - they left them 2D. Don't get me wrong - the whole story is 2D - like the movie/book = all black and white - no grays. But what they should have done is tried to create the story alive. What they did was weak. It was only a translation from one medium (2D comic book) to another (the big screen). It totally failed for me. (NOTE: the average score for this movie is an 8.4 - very high amongst the other IMDb.com movie scores. E.g. Some major classics, which you would think should be a 10, will only have an average score of a 7.0 or less!)I think it would have worked if they actually included scenes from the comic book - if at least to remind people the origins of this work. But they didn't. Perhaps the Directory of Photography was to blame... but the Director always has the final say. All movies rise or fail with the Directors... i.e. if the Producers don't put any limits on them or on their creativity. 0 out of 10, although the lowest IMDb.com score is a 1.Directing - OK,Acting - stiff,Photography - very good,Special Effects - excellentStory - stiff-Zafoid",1,9,21,11 December 2005
The Island," A Movie For The Ages (pun intended)
","I saw this movie because no others were on cable that seemed like a scifi. This is not a scifi per se (this is not exactly a scifi). What it is is a thought provoking action filled brilliantly directed, edited, cast, written movie about ... cloning. It takes the question of human cloning to a new height and brings it right up to your face.Sounds boring? YOU BET! That's what I thought - but it is anything but! Directed by Mr. Michael Bay Writing credits (WGA) Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci (screenplay) As I will always say, a great movie has to be great in all categories - from editing to directing - and this one is just that. I wholly expected a sequence of utterly boring chase scenes with 'cute guy' and 'handsome chick' ... or is it the other way around? I forget, Hollywood is so terrible these days. However, the acting in all the roles was so well played I forgot I was watching a movie and got involved in the lives of these people. Kudos to the _entire_ cast as well to Casting.Acting:Ewan McGregor .... Lincoln Six Echo/Tom LincolnScarlett Johansson .... Jordan Two Delta/Sarah JordanDjimon Hounsou .... Albert LaurentSean Bean .... MerrickSteve Buscemi .... McCordMichael Clarke Duncan .... StarkweatherAPPLAUSE!!! APPLAUSE!!! ENCORE!!! ENCORE!!!Ewan McGregor: always puts in a great role - he allows to slip gently into his character's situation. Wonderful. I will look for any movie he does in the future. E.g. I didn't recognize him from his other roles, but found his name on the Star Wars roster - amazing - THAT's WHO HE IS!?!?! wow! (I have a new appreciation for real actors such as Mr. McGregor because of Mr. Tom Cruise's inability to do anything other than look pretty, which I discovered from his payroll job in 'War of the Worlds: the ruining of an American Classic into an emotionless nothing.')Scarlett Johansson: I don't understand, nor like, Hollywood's perpetual casting of blondes with big appendages in the lead female roles. However, like Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider, Ms. Scarlett Johansson (who plays Jordan 2 Delta - great names!) is utterly convincing in every scene she plays. I applaud her - in every scene she stopped being a 'pretty face' and always performed as a real person in a real situation. Wonderful. Ms. Johansson is wonderful as she natural as she is beautiful. It is hard to believe that Hollywood found a 'beautiful blonde' who can also have such strong acting ability. I hope Hollywood doesn't ignore her for her acting talent.Djimon Hounsou: a walking wall with perfect on screen presence. He was who he played - from the SEAL Team leader to the de-humanized son of a freedom fighter. His character's focus and determination was palpable. Again, another actor to look for in any movie he makes.Sean Bean: totally, 100% convincing as he brought that sociopathic god-complex doctor to life. You want to reach through the screen and ... *breath* ... he really played the part up. There's a scene where Merrick (Bean) is talking to Laurent (Hounsou) where Merrick's persona leaps off of the big screen and you see him for what he truly is - give Mr. Bay, Mr. Bean's make-up artist, and Mr. Bean a standing-O for bring that to the foreground at a precise moment. Wonderful.Steve Buscemi: enough personality to dominate and sustain the entire movie. I can't forget any of Mr. Buscemi's roles. He is so magnificent in all of them - anytime he is in a movie I watch the movie just to see him... if the movie that is made around him is good, then so much the better. If it isn't ... then I got to see Mr. Buscemi in another role - it's a win-win! :)Michael Clarke Duncan: every appearance, no matter how small, he manages to bring to life with his giant heart. In Armageddon as 'Bear,' in The Green Mile as 'John Coffey' (wow!), The Whole Nine Yards as 'Franklin 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa,' (great!) in Planet of the Apes as 'Colonel Attar,' (THE ONLY ACTOR WORTH WATCHING IN THAT TIM BURTON MESS THEY SHOULD BURN THE MASTER!!!)and in The Island as 'Starkweather.' Mr. Duncan should get bigger roles - am I the only person who sees this?This is a rare cast - this is a rare director - this is a movie for the ages!11/10-ZafoidPS: I am not a fan of directors at all - there are some who make good movies who I would definitely go see, but only Mr. Michael Bay is worth looking for! I am now a 'Michael Bay fan.' The next time I see a new movie I will LOOK FOR his name... if he directed it I will see it. I was only willing to do this with one other director - Stanley Kubrik. I think if Mr. Kubrik was alive today, he would applaud Mr. Bay's magnificent gift to direct.PPS: I know how to take photos... I take the picture in my head ahead of time... Mr. Bay said the same thing about his movies - he knows what he is doing. Fledgling directors take note - learn from Mr. Michael Bay - a future American Master.-Z",10,1,3,26 January 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Winner!
","I think this is Will Ferrell's best comedy. There are many good jokes, and some touching moments. (There were some moments which are openly non-straight which I found pointless.) Overall this is just plain funny. I laughed several times unexpectedly which suggests that there was some originality involved with the script.I loved Gary Cole who played Reese Bobby to a 'T' - perfectly. It was a personal pleasure for me b/c the only other movie I have seen him in (which he did flawlessly) was 'Office Space.' He did 'Reese' so well that I didn't recognize him in his opening scene.John C. Reilly as 'Ricky Bobby's' best friend was utterly convincing throughout the movie. I kept thinking, 'can he be that stupid?' then had to realize he was only acting - great job.Michael Clarke Duncan? He can do anything and he is ***ALWAYS*** a joy and a pleasure to watch on the big screen. I wish I was a producer - he'd be in every movie I ever made!Finally, the racing scenes: I don't watch NASCAR, but to me the racing scenes were very well done and completely believable. 10 out of 10.-LDPS: the continual reference to Christ as if He is an object of comedy was disappointing, but I have learned that the non-believing world use His name however they like ... just as *I* use to when I was a non-believer.
