Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Painfully Funny
","This movie has to be one of the funniest of all time. However this humour comes out of the awkward situations that Borat is in and therefore this humiliation is passed to the viewer, making the movie somewhat painful. This movie reveals amazing things about America which someone from outside of the country can appreciate more. I could hardly believe the things that people said and did in this movie and it shows a different side to America which I never knew truly existed. Cohen does this by being racist and sexist himself, however he is joking they are not. His brilliance shines in this one. An awesome movie and definitely worth seeing both for the comedic value and the insight into some racist and sexist American people.",9,6,11,13 July 2007
