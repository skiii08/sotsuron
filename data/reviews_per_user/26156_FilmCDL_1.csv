The Blair Witch Project," Great movie
","Blair Witch Project is awesome. For those of you who  don't get it **** off. The awesome part of the movie is its amateur making. If you've never made an amateur movie you can never understand the limits you have. It's very hard to get every thing right. Luckily I knew someone who went on to Hollywood films so I had good acting. I've always been trying to figure out a movie like this. I thought the last 5 minutes were probabaly the best stuff I've ever seen. The idea of using an offhand comment to give the final scene is awesome. Just so you don't think I'm some stupid person, I have a PhD in Film Studies from New York University. Go see Blair Witch and enjoy it.",10,1,2,22 August 1999
