Minority Report," What a waste of time........and money
","Save yourself some money and what is worst to waste, TIME!! A film with a poor and predictable plot, decently acted with many ridiculous and ludricrous scenes ( example, Anderton chasing his eye balls!) It's about time Spielberg realizes he's not Stanley Kubrick and he'll never be Kubrick before he decides to direct another unwatchable film like Minority Report and A.I! He's good for high budget films like Jurassic Park or any other movie that he can make fifty sequels and sell millions in action figures and dull toys from them. Please Mr. Spielberg leave good quality futuristic films for real directors as Ridley Scott and return to dull films like E.T.",1,4,8,5 August 2002
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Beautiful but........
","Once again John Madden has given us a magnificent film. A simple but beautiful story  located in a real paradise and the music can't be better, Stephen Warbeck delights us once more, and good actings but.........why on earth is Penelope Cruz in this film? I asked myself that same question while watching this movie. Of course her greek accent is not believable, she's uncapable of acting decently not even in one scene. Not even at the end she did a good job, after so many events, after years she finally gets to see Corelli again and she couldn't change the same face of stupidy we had to bear during the whole film. Anyway, Cage was very good in one of his best characters; Hurt also is great in his and the rest of the cast all did a great job, so the final result is a movie that really is worth of watching. This is a beautiful film that not even Mrs. Cruz was able to spoil. So far I think it's Madden best work so no fan will be disappointed.",7,1,3,27 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The best film ever !!!
","Yes, Peter Jackson took some liberties from the book but that doesn't matter when the result is a beautiful and extraordinary film like this one. It's amazing how you find lines from the book in scenes that were created for the film and those lines are sometimes more important in the film that when they're mentioned in the book, for example Boromir in Lothlorien speaking of Gondor that is a description in the ROTK and the words are more beautiful when Boromir speaks them. The different fantastical worlds where the Fellowship passes are amazingly created. The special effects are the best I've seen; the music is incredibly beautiful. Excellent actings, specially Sean Bean and Ian McKellen. Every detail in this film was carefully done, from the weapons, clothes, scenery, sounds, music, special effects. Without any doubt Peter Jackson is the greatest director of these days, so move on overrated Spielberg because a man of real talent has revealed himself with the most extraordinary film ever done.",10,1,1,19 December 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Can a movie be more beautiful?
","..........no, I don't think so. Ang Lee has captured the beauty of a scenery and the sounds of a bamboo forest and waterfalls to narrate an extraordinary story of legendary warriors, brave hearts and love. Beyond special effects, this movie combines all necessary elements to be beautiful, as simple as that,and all framed with Tan Dun's music which gets in you. It's hard to believe a film can transmit so much feelings as this one does. Once you've watched Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you will never forget it.",9,0,0,8 March 2001
