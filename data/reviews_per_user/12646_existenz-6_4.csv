Catch Me If You Can," Amusing joy ride of a film
","'Catch Me If You Can' is easily Spielberg's best film since 'Saving Private Ryan', and his best comedy ever.  The film is a funny, exciting, adventurous journey into the world of conman extraordinaire Frank Abagnale Jr.  If you don't know who he is now, you will after seeing this movie.Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much going into this.  Spielberg's films have become so premeditated recently, with just the right angle, just the right piece of music and just the right look of awe on the actors' faces, that his films haven't been truly enjoyable for some time.  He's like a novelist who, despite great diction and flawless punctuation, has lost his touch when it comes to story and character.  With 'Catch Me If You Can', Spielberg has finally loosened up and let the story take center stage.  It's an understated but mesmerizing success.  I even forgot that I was watching a Steven Spielberg film, which is a sign of how good it is.Christopher Walken, who did a Q&A after the screening, said that this movie was filmed very quickly.  Maybe that's why Spielberg didn't burden the movie with too much style -- he didn't have time to.",7,0,0,15 December 2002
Chinatown," Good, not the greatest
",This is a good movie with solid dialogue and solid performances.  My problem is that the story is slow moving and nothing that exciting happens.  With all the hoopla around this film I thought it would be mind blowing like 'The Godfather' but in my humble opinion it doesn't come close.,8,0,3,1 June 2001
Duck You Sucker," Big disappointment
","I almost fell asleep watching this movie, despite being a huge Sergio Leone fan.  Steiger sounds Cuban rather than Mexican, Coburn loses his Irish accent every time he raises his voice, and the action scenes are a big disappointment.  The 'Dollars' trilogy and 'Once Upon a Time in the West' are not only four of the best Westerns ever made, they are four of the best films ever made.  Period.  But 'Duck You Sucker' aka 'Fistful of Dynamite' isn't in the same league.  It's no wonder Leone gave up on the genre and didn't direct another movie for thirteen years.Leone's trademark style, with breathtaking visuals and intense, brooding characters is completely missing from this film.  The story doesn't have any focus, and there's a whole lot of bad dialogue.  The film actually has more in common with Leone's plodding debut, the abysmal 'Colossus of Rhodes', than it does with his Eastwood/Bronson westerns.  No style, no substance, and none of the great humor of his previous films, I strongly suggest you skip this and go rent 'Keoma' instead.  Now there's a real 1970s Spaghetti Western.",4,15,32,14 January 2003
The Mummy Returns," Some good effects, no plot
","Mummy Returns had a few good things going for it, but none of them have to do with plot or entertainment value.  The effects were okay for the most part, although the Scorpion King monster at the end was awful.  The second unit photography and many of the Egyptian vistas were beautiful, and the sets were pretty good ripoffs of those in the Indiana Jones movies.Out of all the actors, clearly Brendan Fraser was the worst.  He was boring, he had nothing to do, and he wasn't funny at all.  Oded Fehr was the best actor in the movie, along with the Rock.  Unfortunately the Rock is only in the first five minutes of the movie, and he has almost no lines of dialogue. His CGI appearance at the end, of course, was forgettable.This movie could have been much better -- right now it has a lot of boring, unoriginal moments.",1,2,4,6 May 2001
