The Hangover," A good comedy
","Yes,this was a good comedy.I didn't expect much from this movie.I must say that if you liked Old School,Step-Brothers,Wedding Crashers,SuperBad and other wacked out comedies you will enjoy this one.I must say that just because of the storyline doesn't mean certain people can't enjoy it.So what if the movie is somewhat crude and has odd things happening in it..that is comedy people and this comedy cracked me up so hard I actually wanted to see it again after it finished.This movie had the whole theatre laughing beginning til end.Seriously,Bradley Cooper was great and so was that other guy who kind of played the airhead.Actually all the actors were GREAT.I have to say I like this movie for what is: somewhat crude,yet hilarious. A good storyline and good actors with some good chemistry make for an awesome movie.Believe if you liked Old School and films like it you should see it.If you need a good feel 'make you laugh' type of movie see this.Won't disappoint.",9,2,4,25 September 2009
"I Love You, Man"," Looking for a good comedy
","Well you will get a good laugh out of this movie. If you are a fan of any of Paul and Jason's film you should see this one.This movie has a storyline,good laughs and all around has a good feel throughout the movie. The role that Jason played in the film was just right and quite funny. If you liked Step-Brothers,Sarah Marshall,Wedding Crashers and all other goofy movies than this one is perfect. If you are not a fan of comedy I still suggest you just take a peek and view it.It is quite funny.I wouldn't mind watching it again.",8,0,1,22 September 2009
Superbad," Hilarious screwball comedy
","This movie was funny and I don't mean just one scene.This movie throughout made me laugh non-stop.If you love a good screwball type comedy you should see this movie.The actors are superb and play them well.If you have ever seen Jonah Hill and Micheal Cera in previous movies you should check them out in this one.How can I not say nothing about Seth Rogen and the part he played.I must say that if you don't like crude and foolish behavior you might not like this movie,but again if you need a good comedy to make you laugh,well see this one.A good solid comedy with laughs and a decent storyline. I am sure some of you all can relate to this individuals.I don't want to ruin it for people who haven't seen it but these characters will have you laughing.Very funny movie.Seth Rogen fans must see this one.I think that is movie was funnier a little funnier than Pineapple Express. Pineapple Express had it's moments but I liked this one better.",8,0,3,24 September 2009
Paranormal Activity," Not quite what I was expecting
","From the previous of this film I thought I was going into something really scary.Something scary like holding onto the seat,popcorn bag dropping out of your hand movie. As a horror fan this movie didn't sit well with me. Yes,cheap movie being made and acting was OK,but there was really not really a lot of chill to this movie.OK,maybe a few scares.I think the previews that was mostly shown was the part at the end and that was the scariest part of the film. Everyone has a different view on what is scary,what is gory and what a really horror flick consists of.There was something lacking here and let me tell you when I did see this in the theater..well after it was over most of the people weren't too happy.Theatre crowd: 'WTF' was that or that was it...but,but.Give it a chance.",7,0,1,5 December 2009
Zombieland," Good Zombie flick
","Considering I am not really a hardcore fan of zombie movies I thought to give this movie a try.I also have to admit there were a few actors in the movie that I have previously seen in other movies that I have enjoyed so that is why I leaned on the whole 'yes,I will see this'.First off if you don't like a little gore and blood this movie isn't for you. If you like cheesy gory fun with some twisted humor thrown in well this movie just might be for you.The movie itself is( I am not going to spoil it for you) about some people trying to stay alive and stay away from zombies and of course kill them. I found that the actors such as Woody,Jesse and the others were did a good job. I must say that Bill Murrays cameo did it for me.That was a hilarious scene/part all together. If you are a fan of Bill you have to check it out also...and then there were the twinkies.A good zombie flick for zombie lovers.I would recommend to others to view. It was really an interesting and fun adventure.",8,0,0,13 October 2009
Halloween," Great classic
","I can remember way back watching this and being terrified of that heavy breathing psycho waving that knife around and lurking for his next victim.A demented brother stalking his sibling and anyone who gets in his way.This movie is classic and at best during the Halloween month.This movie as it all: story,suspense,horror and damn near tingling during certain kill scenes.This is a movie you want to watch in the dark,but be very be careful because you might get a little nervous if you are watching it alone.Jamie Lee Curtis is superb and lets out all the screams for the most part to get away from that deranged psycho.If you are looking for something scary,mind tingling with some good lurking music check out this classic if you haven't already.",8,0,2,26 September 2009
Up in the Air," A very surprising movie
","I went in not expecting much. However, I did read the reviews and I do or have enjoyed most of the movies that have featured George Clooney. Also,the woman who plays his love interest has been in a few movies that I have enjoyed also.George Clooney provided this movie with wit,charm and humor. To me this was all about self discovery and I think most people can relate to that.The movie pulls you in and I think the plot was good. Jason Bateman made me laugh a few times and the sad thing about the movie is that you got to see different people tell there story about how they felt about getting laid off. The look and emotions on their face is the reality most people face these days.I thought the acting was fantastic and I was glad that I viewed this movie. I think George and Vera had good chemistry.Hope you take a chance and view this.",8,1,4,19 December 2009
