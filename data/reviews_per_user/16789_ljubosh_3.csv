Minority Report," My second time
","WOW, for the second time in my life ( the first one was for Schindler's List) Spielberg successes in surprend me. Minority Report is good and not obvious. I've never read this Dick's novel but after that I've seen, I'll certainly do it. What a frightenely future!! I think this film could be an international success also without Tom Cruise even if in this case he plays quite good. However, there are some problems. The film starts good, continues better, but has the classic bad happy end which is a strong characteristic of most Spielberg's films. I'll pray you Steven, gimme some disturbing end in your future films. You're great. You can do it.",8,0,0,11 October 2002
28 Days Later...," what a particular story!
","It's incredible! I didn't think that digital cameras were quite good for making a good frightening sci-fi film. Do you remeber the terrible Blair Witch Project? The first part of the film is excellent! The desolation in Piccadilly Circus is sensational! Good characters, good playing, but the best are the zombies: bad,fast and furious. Go Danny go!",8,0,0,26 June 2003
Evil Dead II," steady-cam and gore
","After its first apparition THE EVIL is back, but also Ash is back!The same place, the same beautiful cottage, a different slashed girl and the same guys' misfortune. Is Ash remaking himself?At the beginning he makes the same errors:listening a tape,open a book(reading is dangerous in horror films).THE answer to the question is NO; Ash is stronger and meets a new friend: his electric saw!!! This film isn't  considered from critics as a good film and by the way is considered ugly if compared to the first evil dead. I don't think so. Bruce Campbell plays a fantastic role and Sam Raimi uses a 'true' steady-cam in a perfect way. It is true that the story is the same of evil dead, but it isn't possible to define this film only as a remake. It is more pyrothecnich and pleasant to see. The ending is the product of a person who is completely fool but is too much strange and unbelievable that it sounds good.",Null,0,0,30 June 2003
