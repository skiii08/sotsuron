Hereditary," Slow burn beginning, firey end.
","I had to come and add another review to the thousand or so already here. I guess Heriditary is not for everyone. I watched it and midway through I caught myself pondering why, when I already have so many nightmares, I'd watch a film that was giving me genuine chills. Its not perfect by any means, at two hours I think it could definitely have used a little trimming, while wonderfully put together there are some long slow shots in the first hour that just draw the pacing out unnecessarily. That said, I also considered that perhaps it was to provide a counter point to the drama that really begins to make the movie unfold at about the 35 minute mark. The spark to the touch paper of this film left me with a physical sense of chill. Then I begun to get bored again, and I was considering turning it off. Then thought to myself, its a shame that we've got so used to having quick pay offs that we can't admire the detail. A bit like drawing a dot on a tiny model laptop to signify the camera? There is some lovely direction here, even if it does sometimes feel prolonged. From the hour mark onward, I was treated to a rare (in modern horror) and palpable sense of growing dread. It was nice to see new actors and some less familiar, but still known ones, playing unusual roles and doing so well. Perhaps in this sense giving the characters more of a feeling of genuineness, as you were seeing a character not just 'such and such' playing.One thing that I would preferred would have been a little more depth behind the inheritance. Some removal of character exposition earlier in the film could easily have made way for a little more explanation to exactly what happened at the end. But perhaps that was the point.",7,1,3,25 August 2018
Captain Marvel," I wasnt going to watch it
","I had forgotten I'd already rated it 4/10 before I'd even seen it. I must have done that around the time of release in anticipation of my expectation. I honestly dont remember.Imagine my surprise when I did finally watch the film to give it the rating I thought it deserved 4/10 to find I'd already rated it 4/10.I didnt like Captain Marvel. I didnt like the characters. I didnt like the dialogue. I didnt enjoy the lack of chemistry between the actresses. I didn't like the smarmy attitudes.I did like the overall story and the Nick Fury backstory. I found the mid-90s nostalgia somewhat amusing in some places but flat and anachonistic in others 'sophisticated two-way pager'.. why would not just a cell?Theres some value in the film, its watchable, but a long way from the charm of the other Marvel films in to which it belongs.",4,5,12,5 December 2019
