Antz," Not For Children
","This movie is not really a good movie. The animation is OK, the voice cast a bit surprising, the language is not child friendly, and the plot is a tad boring and predictable. Honestly, I am disgusted by the fact that they would put ANY foul language in a 'kid's' movie at all. Definitely not a good movie for young children or even preteens. This review requires ten lines so please excuse me for a moment: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 Sorry about that, thank you for reading!",2,1,6,1 July 2014
The Lion King," Wonderful Movie!
","This is a wonderful movie for all ages. I loved it when I was younger and I still love it now. There is one scene that I believe has some shaman chanting but I could be wrong. The animation is great, the songs are fun, and it has an interesting plot line. I was intrigued throughout the entire movie and I quite enjoyed the ending. This movie is probably one of my favorite Disney movies. I feel it is ridiculous that this review has to be ten lines so please disregard the following: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Sorry for that. :)",9,0,1,1 July 2014
