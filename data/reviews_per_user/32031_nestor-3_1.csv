The Blair Witch Project," Totally unscary - played like a $30,000 film
","After seeing the commercials and hearing all the hype, I was really looking forward to this film and could tell that most of the people standing in line also were. It was easy to tell that some were really nervous.The initial buildup was OK and humorous in places and quite believable as the threesome lost their way in the forest.  However, after enduring repetitive arguing and whining, the movie quickly lost its appeal and became obnoxious and nauseating - not scary.  The last ten minutes were supposed to be terrifying, but were the same as the rest of the movie. 
In a film that boasts plausibility as its strong point, who could possibly believe that any exhausted, panic stricken person lost in the woods would first throw away their map, then spent the next several days lugging a heavy set of camera equipment around as they tried to escape? 
By the groans and comments of the other moviegoers I heard as I left, the feeling was one of mutual disappointment and resentment at all the hype. A REAL BOMB.",Null,0,1,30 August 1999
