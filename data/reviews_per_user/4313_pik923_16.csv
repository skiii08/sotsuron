Changeling," an awful film, for shame for such a poorly created script
","and to have so many clich√©s in script and action. What a pity. This had all the possibilities of being a fine film, but it just doesn't work. From the opening scenes of mother and son getting up in the morning, to the end. Even the acting is so predictable and even over the top. I don't understand why so many people liked this film. It is a complete dud. A complete waste of time, money and talent. The actors who portrayed the police - again - its just over the top. Go see LA Confidential if you want to see a film that shows police corruption but gives you decent acting, decent acting, decent direction. Too bad. It is a complete waste of time. I prayed it would end. It finally did!!!",Null,2,9,28 February 2009
Deja Vu," A great thriller, Tony Scot does it again
","I enjoyed every moment of this sci-fi thriller - and the script allows you to believe it and buy it and if you go with it, you'll enjoy a great thriller! Denzel is one of the few, if only actor who I will go see just because he's in a film. He has that ability to make his character so juicy and believable that you go with what he is doing...Paula Patton is wonderful, as is the entire cast. From the music to the storyline, to the cinematography - I loved it! I was on the edge of my seat and not really sure where they were taking me - which I love! I really don't like predicting a script and this was never a predictable storyline...Well done. Tony Scott is a good solid director - and his teaming up with Denzel (Man on Fire) proved to be a correct marriage of film talent! See the film if you like Denzel, if you like good scripts and thrillers bordering on sci-fi. At several points in the film you are really involved in two films for the price of one! Well done - thank you!",9,0,1,29 September 2007
Monster," MASTERPIECE, A MOTION PICTURE PERFECTION
","It is rare, in the world we live in, to see a film of such tremendous accomplishment shine on the screen in theatres around the world.  What a pity the film was not nominated for best picture, best direction, best editing.  However, the Best Actress award was well earned.  It should have the likes of Streep, Close, Sarandon and others re-examining their acting methods and quality of performance.As great as the film is that is how disturbing it is.  So for those who have not seen the film, do see it but know that it is very disturbing.  The content, the story, the helplessness, hopelessness, the rage, the rape, it is all too much for the mind to handle. And then to know this is based on a true story - it only magnifies the strength of the story.There are moments of cinematography that are glorious.  Spielberg can learn a thing or two from this young and extraordinary film maker.  To every member of cast and crew - this film can be compared with the handful of great motion pictures the world will always remember.  The acting of Charlize Theron can only be compared to the great Bette Davis, Ingrid Bergman, Vivien Leigh.  It is a ;moment of true artistic transcendence.Thank you Patty Jenkins!!  You are a genius.",10,1,2,3 July 2004
Argo," Good solid film that is as relevant today as it was when it first came out
","Congratulations to Ben Affleck - he did a masterful job directing the film, while playing the important miraculous center pillar character of the script - Tony Mendez.There are those who argue about the 'truth' of the film however it is all glossed over by the first statement - Based on a true story - meaning this is not a documentary and to create the tension and suspense (even if you know the end) and the pace of bringing this to the screen - well worth all the 'facts' that aren't as clean and clear as many would believe or desire.But this is a film - and brings you into the historic moments with both real footage and reenactments.I don't want to give anything away if you haven't seen the film - it's too good.Acting is great, Alan Arkin is perfect, John Goodman couldn't be better - everyone - was well cast.Going back to Ben Affleck - taking an intriguing story with moments of a large cast interwoven with an ensemble cast - hats off to you Ben - and that the Academy ignored you - well Barbra Streisand was never nominated for Best Director and her masterpiece YENTL although a completely different genre - is equally great to your film.Go see it and if you are a film student study it - the music, pacing, casting, script, locations, props, costuming, the history - the era - wow!!!",10,2,3,19 August 2019
Wanted," Interesting action packed film
","I really enjoyed this film. It has its own fantasy and own life and if you follow it, just go with it, not really knowing where it will take you, how 'true' it will be, how filled with 'fantasy' or other worldliness - well just enjoy it.Enjoy the special effects, enjoy the fullness of a production that really is quite fascinating in the world of film making. Not the greatest film, but well worth watching especially in our life of revealing secrets of 'illuminati' and conspiracy theories, mixing magic with reality, fact or fiction where science fiction is now science reality - sit back and enjoy the film!This is not my usual genre of film that I enjoy, but I have to say - the cast is solid, the story even more so and yes the cinematography and effects - great! Enjoy",8,1,2,20 October 2009
Mamma Mia!," Wrong director, and the cast? Not so sure
","Meryl Streep as always is a consummate actress. She pulls off a strong performance. Most of the main cast, also good, however there are problems with the cast, problems with the choreography and definitely problems with the director. It needed someone with a real motion picture vision, who can take a mediocre script and plot, with songs most everyone knows, and really make it work. It just didn't do it for me. Camera angles were disturbing, the constant thump thump throb of music with same type of dancing was boring and Meryl is asked to jump up and down all over the place, which works on stage, but the film limits everyone.Too bad! I was hoping for something stronger. I saw the show and enjoyed it. Let's face it, the show is an international phenomenon, which one cannot explain, except for the obvious, ABBA is so very popular. And the music is interjected in the right places. The film doesn't work as well as the stage performance. You can of course just sit back and enjoy the music if you want, even if the arrangements are a bit dull.Meryl S has a lovely voice - and has been professionally trained. It shows! Too bad she didn't do more musicals when she was younger. I am sure many will enjoy the film. The big problem as mentioned before, the director is poor and she had no control over the motion picture. Too bad!",5,2,3,12 February 2009
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Wonderful brilliant atypical Quentin filled with his passion
","The strength courage and talent of a writer/director is often overlooked - how to lift your cast above the rest, above their best, and keep to that characterization from first moment to the last.Quentin moves his characters like a chess master, add to that his passion and admiration for television of the late 60s, spaghetti westerns and knowledge and appreciation of the film world, with Quentin twists and turns, with a brilliant sound track costuming casting - I loved this film.Don't walk run to watch it don't read reviews don't get caught up with finding out too much of the plot (do that afterwards if you don't know or appreciate the late 60s and history that era)...Leo at his best
Pacino should stay away from Scorsese a lazy director and stick with Wuentin
Brad yes an Oscar and the rest of an ensemble castI wonder if Roman Polanski watched the film .
What an ending makes me weepy weepy weepy",10,16,21,24 February 2020
The Game," I gave it one star just for trying
","I don't want to give anything away since it isn't fair to those who haven't seen the film. However, all in all it's a waste of time, energy money talent.
However will comment on the script
it's a dud that appears to be very clever, but it's a dud
acting - well Michael Douglas isn't an. actor's actor because he always plays the same part - you know - that great comment - we need someone whose like Michael Douglas - you know - gritty, nasty, unhappy, full of himself, not really interesting but sells enough tickets at the box office to make it worth his while.Rest of the cast is pretty good - they do their best - but really even with the twists and turns the outcome is almost predictable but ridiculous -A waste of time and money and energy and talent.It isn't a brain teaser - although it appears to be that, and it tries to be intelligent but misses the mark.",1,2,5,25 September 2019
Moulin Rouge!," the best
","can't get any better than this.  Luhrmann is a master craftsman and inventor of a new cinema.  Congratulations to everyone involved in the making and creation of the film.  It takes awhile to adjust to the method of editing and use of special effects, mixing dialogue with song, great orchestrations with great acting, a huge achievement.  In this world of quick fix cinema, the production is obviously a work of love, devotion and dedication.  That itself is unique.",10,0,1,11 August 2003
Mulholland Drive," Why?
","I give it a rating of 7 because the acting is great! It was an important film for many cast and crew members and yes it won awards. What bothers me the most is why are homosexual men and women STILL accepted on the screen if they are portrayed as crazy, or murderers, psychopaths, etc etc etc. Yes of course it gave a certain edginess to the film - wasn't that the whole idea? But still - David Lynch - you should do better than that! Really! It gets boring to see these roles produced over and over and over and over again.With that said, the film is interesting, there are some wonderful moments in the film, and I enjoy film noir, which is the wrong term for this film - how can it be film noir when it's in color? But then again, ahhhh all those young film makers.The film could have been even more glorious if shot in black and white, but then we wouldn't have seen pink - hmmmm.And the film is also very choppy - you have to go beyond beyond beyond to grasp the context of the film, because it is sometimes so far out into the world of David Lynch, one doesn't know what happened. I think, unfortunately, every one got nervous because of time factors, so editing was done to keep it within 2.5 hours, which again is unfortunate. I think if the film was able to play out longer, then the story line would be more comprehensible and much more interesting....but then again...If there is a director's cut and a DVD with David's editing and how he wanted the film to really be seen, I would like to see that one....however that would not remove the stigma, the heaviness and unfortunate script of lesbian lovers gone mad.",8,1,2,11 August 2012
Mystic River," Disappointing, predictable and unfair
","The first fifteen minutes of the film were great. I was intrigued. I was dancing for Clint Eastwood as a director. Then the movie was bogged down by over acting, and an over bloated script. Too much, always too much. I am a big fan of Sean Penn and a big fan of Tim Robbins. Glad they are now Oscar winners, but unfortunately not this film.The ending was becoming more and more predictable as time lingered on. The script lost it's crisp insight and dynamics. Felt like the screenwriters had so many ideas to fill into these pages that they lost the plot, the reason for writing this screenplay.The film should be used as an example of how everything in a film can start out right - from director, script, cast to technical crew and how, with inflated egos and no direction, fall apart. It is another mediocre attempt of Hollywood figures to create a great film. But there is not greatness to be found.Too bad. I really had high expectations and really wanted to enjoy the film. Clint - go watch the one film Patty Jenkins directed, MONSTER. Sean and Tim watch Charlize Theron - she can teach all of Hollywood what acting should be. Better luck next time.",3,2,4,1 December 2004
Man on Fire," Great action suspense film! Congratulations Tony Scott
","One of the best in it's genre. That simple. Tony Scott uses the camera, music, various techniques including subtitles to their ultimate. At any time the acting could go 'over the top' but it doesn't - congratulations to Mr. Scott for keeping the cast under control, but yet free enough to make it all real. The cast is great! From beginning to end the film will keep you at the edge of your seat. But remember - this is an action film, a suspense film and there are some bloody scenes - some are quite on the edge, but again, it never goes over the top. Camera techniques are great! As we move into new technology, there are ways the director with a strong collective group of artists can make things come alive in a new way. And as mentioned before, the use of subtitles - just wonderful, inventive. My only complaint - not speaking Spanish I wish we had translations of the music. That is my weakness - not speaking Spanish, so my apologies. That is the only part that frustrated me with the film. Congratulations to Tony Scott, his entire crew, a superb cast, an amazing script. Ridley Scott is more known in the world of film making, however I think brother Tony is a great great talent.",10,1,4,21 May 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Completely totally disappointing. Whittaker is great, that's about it
","I am trying to figure out why this film received such rave reviews. To make up a story around a doctor who never existed, bring him together in relationships with real life characters as a way to describe Idi Amin and the history of Uganda makes no sense and in fact is a huge draw back to the intensity of any film. There is so much more that could have been done with this story as a film, it is really embarrassing to watch it. The story line itself doesn't hold together. There is no reason behind much of the action except to try to show how crazy Idi is, but why do that with a fictional character when a film like this is asking you to look at the horrible truths of Idi Amin? I did not understand the film, there is little character development. There is a lot of horrific moments of violence but it does not fit together. What a pity! The screenplay is not good; the cinematography in parts is boring and feels like the camera was slipping (ie the editing is worse than the cinematography) and the acting was poor and senseless. Whittaker was wonderful as Idi Amin but even his character development did not make it for me. And can anyone tell me if it's true about Amin's wife and a foreign doctor - white foreign doctor? Is any of that true? Beats me - I can't trust anything about this film.",2,8,13,11 January 2008
Wonder Woman," Why did I watch it
",Okay I wont bother getting into the storyline because I don't think on really exists. What a pity the opening sequences had some interesting moments but like the entire film nothing gets into anything really worth while.A huge crew a great director who's MONSTER was at moments brilliant and afforded its lead actor Charlize Theron a well deserved Oscar. Hollywood being sexist of course did not nominate Patty for an awards - so the story continues.We don't hear from Patty until she makes a comic book action back female based movie. Lots of money lots of case and crew special effects the whole thing you would expect from an action film.This is not art this is just awful. Can't blame anyone in particular this is what Hollywood is offering its stars talent and audiences. Big blockbuster destruction for big profits.STOP IT JUST STOP IT. One thing I have to say which I enjoyed was watching an Israeli Jewish woman beat the crap out of Germans. Besides that - don't waste your time.,1,7,17,15 October 2017
Munich," I'm not a Spielberg fan and this film too is a disappointment
","Spielberg loves to show violence - be it with a knife, a gun, or using sex to depict violence in the body, mind or spirit. There is usually this twisted edge to his films, I include Schindler's List in this for sure...but Munich is a very bizarre film. I am not sure what Spielberg was trying to do with the film. Having lived in Israel during the Munich massacre, I was very aware of Israeli culture, language, behavior and most of the scenes that take place in Israel are just very poor in portraying the Israeli world. It may seem incidental, but to use 'Yiddish' phrasing rather than Hebrew phrasing was truly annoying. Eric Bana is miscast. Sorry everyone, he just is not believable as a young Israeli Mossad agent. The rest of the Israeli Mossad team - well they too just don't give me the feeling that I am watching Israelis. And from there the film goes down hill for me. Spielberg lost me within the first 5 minutes. I could write a scene by scene criticism of the film, but I have to be honest, the film is boring. 1972 was a very interesting year on the planet. I never felt like I was in the year 1972. Add to that, Spielberg and the script, does not give me enough insight into Black September - he doesn't give me their motivation for the massacre. I have to say that in comparison, the film, THE LITTLE DRUMMER GIRL which also explores the world of terrorism and the Israeli Mossad was a very good, solid, informative, on the edge of the seat film. I wish Spielberg would stop being mediocre and give us something we can really get our teeth into.",2,2,7,24 January 2007
Coach Carter," I love this film! Hallelujah
","In a world where millions of dollars are paid to basketball players who have no ethics nor education comes a film about values, morals, about life and choices. Congratulations to Coach Carter and hoping that in our world of capitalistic immorality, education is important. I think someone like Bill Cosby must have thrilled to see this film and all that it means to young people who have been dealt a difficult life.I wish every school in our country would be blessed with at least one Coach Carter and his sense of education, morality, right and wrong, how to live, what is important, that we have choices and good grades ARE important.I wish for every student in our country they can be touched by a teacher like Coach Carter, who offers alternatives.Congratulations on a wonderful film. A wonderful man, wonderful young people, and girls - if you are actually reading this - say no before saying yes to sexual encounters.",9,1,2,10 July 2010
