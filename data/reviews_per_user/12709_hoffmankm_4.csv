United 93," Best Movie That I've Seen in 5 Years
","This movie is so wonderful. The acting is so amazing and realistic. Every aspect of this movie is so perfect. This movie was made for the sole purpose of honoring the heroism of the people who lost their lives on that flight. United 93 is definitely the most moving movie that I've ever seen. They portray it so honorable, and not with all the Hollywood special effects. Though the movie is sad, it serves a purpose and it definitely makes sense. I think that many people need to watch this movie to get an understanding of what actually happened that day. The makers of this movie were so passionate about making this movie for a reason, and to educate people of what happened.",10,2,4,7 January 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Completely Overrated
","This movie is unbelievably overrated. As a movie, of course, it is not the worst movie to watch, and I am not saying that. All I am saying is that this movie is horrifyingly disappointing and overrated, IN MY OWN OPINION. I have talked to other people, and most have loved it. Maybe it is just me, but I found it stupid, pointless, and a waste of time, when I could have been watching other movies. I have heard people continuously complain about how it didn't win 'Best Foreign Language Film' at the Academy Awards, and I have no idea what those people are talking about, it is a totally unsatisfying movie experience. It is utterly a depressing and unbelievably stupid movie. Again, it may not be the worst movie in the world, but it is completely overrated and disappointing.",3,15,33,10 November 2007
Knocked Up," Best Comedy I Have Seen In a Decade
","This really is a great comedy. The makers of this wonderful film took a simple concept, and made it into a hilarious film with a great plot. The movie in so many ways is great, whether it is the acting or the lessons or the jokes, there was something in this movie that was just pure magic. This movie is really a must-see and it will have you cracking up. The real surprise of the movie though, and the thing that really makes it stand out is the surprise morals that you learn from this movie. It is really a brilliant piece of film history and it real is an era defining comedy. It is a movie that is not only funny but also smart and clever. The jokes aren't all dirty jokes, while many of them are.I also must say that this is flat-out the best acting that I have ever seen from Katherine Heigl, who is one of my favorite actresses. She really makes the whole movie believable, and just adds to the greatness that is this movie. It is possibly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and also just one of the best movies I have ever seen. The jokes are very fresh and the movie in no way copies of any movie. The whole movie experience is like something that I have never seen before. That is why Knocked Up is really a must-see movie event.",10,2,8,2 June 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," My Favorite Movie of All Time!
","This is not only the best feel good movie of ever, but my personal favorite movie of all time. The story of the movie is great, and the moral that goes along with it is excellent. The movie makes you feel as if you are a very important person, and it is one of the very few movies that can do that. It was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, and didn't win any, which is a little sad considering it is an absolutely fabulous movie. In this day and age when movies are all about sex, drugs, and alcohol, I know that I can watch this and feel a lot better about cinema, and also feel better about myself. The acting in this movie was so great and the characters were so cute, sweet, and lovable. But some of the characters were mean, but were still well acted. This movie is a great Christmas classic, and in my opinion it is so completely flawless.",10,1,4,27 January 2007
