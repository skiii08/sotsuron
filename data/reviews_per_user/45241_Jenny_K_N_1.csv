The King's Speech," Must Disagree.....
","I am SO glad finally to see a film on George VI. He was a quietly brave man, who not had not speech problems. During WWII, HE knew of secrets that he could not tell anyone, except perhaps the Prime Minister, (Churchill), who knew them as well. Such things as the real horror of the concentration camps, or the real losses the British forces had suffered, etc. These things were deemed 'too horrible' for the general populace to know. So, the King could not speak of them, not even to his own family. He died very, very young -- looking 10 years older than he was.Colin Firth looks to be great in this role. Too bad he doesn't look as much like the King, as Helena Bonham-Carter looks the queen. (George VI was SO handsome....sigh!) But the trailer has it wrong. George VI did NOT have greatness thrust upon him. He was a great man from the moment he was born!",10,1,5,21 December 2010
