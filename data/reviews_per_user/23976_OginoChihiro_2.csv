","It could have been better.  Samara wasn't scary at all!  However, I think Mr. V did a great job directing.  They could have done a better job on choosing an actress for Samara because the Samara in the novel was WAY scarier!!!  Sadoka was better as well.",Null,0,1,9 February 2004

","The Japanese version was EXCELLENT.  However, the English dubbed version of this film is beyond disappointing.  It's disgusting.  Haku sounds like a snob and Chihiro sounds like an annoying brat throughout the whole movie (even at the end when she's supposed to have GROWN UP!)  They made a terrible choice when selecting the voice over cast (ESPECIALLY FOR CHIHIRO) I must applaud Kamaji's voice over, who did a very nice job along with Yababa/Zeniba.  The french dub for Chihiro was WONDERFUL, once again, the English one was HORRIBLE!  Save yourself and stick to the subbed this one time (unless you know French;-D).",1,35,131,9 November 2003
