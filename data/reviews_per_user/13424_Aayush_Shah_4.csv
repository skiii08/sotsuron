E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Film is an Experience... of Crying and Emotions.
","I was just unaware of anything with which the Film's past is related i.e. copied from the Alien, when I watched the movie.
I just heard the movie's name for the First time and when it was from Steven, ears preaked somewhat up, and when saw it is LIKE the movie 'Koi mil gaya', a Bollywood movie which I loved, ears finally preaked up.And I just saw today.
First, the thing that I most loved before watching the movie, is the Poster.
This movie's poster in which Human and the Alien's fingers are getting touched is shown and in the second one in which the Kid riding on the bike and the silhouette of them are being shown by the moon behind, was great ( I am feeling that I have seen such thing somewhere )But about the Movie, I was tied with it.
Has Steven got something called 'Emotions' in his every movies ?
I felt the same when I watched his A.I. movie. ( Again the Abbreviation ! )But in this movie, I literally cried.
I literally cried.
Yes, I'm not a kid who enjoys the movie and cries when something sad happens in the movie but being an adult, I just cried.
The team has beautifully shot those scenes when the researchers are trying to discover from the alien's body.
The whole sequence maybe lasts long for about 20 mins and I cried 20 mins.Very beautifully shot those scenes - But when they stopped my from crying was when the boy opens up the cabin, and the alien laughs and says - 'Please Phone Home ' , yes that was very expected that the makers will not leave the movie in this way and the alien was supposed to get up, but in the way the alien (Sorry E.T.) shouted and told was very hitting moment.Some other factors :
<ul><li>Hey, wait, was E.T. a 3-D model ? ( Obviously, But how realistic in that time !! )</li><li>Flying VFX shots ( Ok, can't say !! )</li></ul>But whatever you say, this movie has something to say.
This movie can be 'Experienced' all time.",9,6,7,2 December 2019
The Theory of Everything," It's about Everything...
",Aah actually no to say anything... it was just greatA movie.... Not actually a movie but it really feels real situation How sir Stephen's life GROWN not like other scientists... but an Unique who have proved his theory wrong just to prove his theory. And also that is called a real love from Jane. This movie is really sensitively attached with every scene and I just loved it.How willpower does he has! Not imaginable...I'm actually loved the last scenes... How director has knew what we need that time... And for satisfaction he once made Stephen sir to get up from the chair... How lovely was that! And in last he has proved his intelligence with revising the whole movie till the first scene when Jane met Hawking.And truly emotionally attached it me with all the life he had. There is no negative point of this movie and really when I'm writing this I watched it twice to get more emotional....But I gave it 4 and half ratings... But the half rating is cut for they haven't shown us HOW HE DISCOVERED HIS THEORY. His efforts and to researches those are lacing part.. but still it's the best movie I have seen ... So i am gonna watch it again... What by you?,9,1,1,23 November 2017
The Shape of Water," Excuse me - It's not a Monster movie
","I've seen this movie which has been almost a year after it has won couple of Oscars and was that famous in various categories as La Las Land was in the previous to previous year for Nomination and Winning an award.Scrolling through the reviews and checking an IMDB review for every movie before I watch ( Also check the R -Rated scenes for that !) , it is about 7.7 Now when I am writing.As I was expecting a movie which should have I mean It should have at least > 7.5 if it has great story and direction but if it has won couple of Oscars and other stuff I thought it must have 8 ratings. But I planned to watch it, especially attracted towards its title and the main Cinematography saw in the Poster is say I didn't even know what is the Movie all about.And it turns out as A Masterpiece .
Oscars are not wrong - Let's just ignore Filmfare of Bollywood.
From start to end, no doubt the CREATURE was looking somewhat Cute and dengerous as Mr. Strikland was shown bleeding losing his tow fingers in the early of this movie, but was still not trusting that creature when Elisa was sitting too much close to HIM and giving him food and talking in Emotional language.It was a Different Romance story between A Human and a Creature which is a fish type one unlike shown in the Beauty and The Beast. ( I don't know why haven't I seen this one yet ? )Watching this movie feels like there is a hope of someone to come in your life right on the right time. The Mute girl when speaks and sings the song feels about the scene in the movie - Theory of Everything. And it also feels that theme of Theory of Everything how a woman cares of a person she loves with heart.Except those Nudity the movie feels so right. Those scenes make movie that , that type of typical movie which has no value.<ul><li>There should be no need for Mr. Strikland and his wife's scene.</li><li>No need to show whole 10 seconds camera hold showing Elisa's daily habit in</li></ul>the tub. ( It could have been shown Indirectly )But the movie becomes so Interesting when it gives a Point to think of Elisa's being that Same Creature as it was trapped and experimented not being a Human.Some clues are there : People have written in the reviews likeShe was Found in the Water
She Can't speak
She has those ScarsAnd some others that I don;t want to repeat.
In Conclusion :The movie is really worth to watch, 'cause it delivers a different romantic feeling and good cinematography.",9,3,6,9 April 2019
Joker," You need Motivation to watch it... otherwise its Boring ( Can't SMILE )
","When for the first time I heard of the movie JOKER is being releasing and is by WB, I was anticipating for it as I was waiting for such movie or a character who is a Psychologically moved and does everything his own - Doesn't care of anybody to get attention to his who just does his work.And this movie was quite in news when it was confirmed to be released.
I just watched it now but sorry guyz, it doesn't met my expectations.By the meaning of 'Expectations', from the Posters like he looking in the sky opening his hands; that feels like the source of self-motivation and living the life without caring of anybody's feeling.The scene in the trailer too, that the Joker ( Arthur ) makes his face as a 'laughed one' with his fingers and the blue tear coming from his eye. That's just amazing combination of laughing when he is crying !The Movie --The starting is Naiceee with the scene of the theme of the movie but as it goes ahead, it loses the storyline... I mean where is the story? A man who is Psychologically disturbed and in 2/3 of the movie is shown his work of just killing the three people and some protest of the people and then his tries of getting people laugh, gets some personal animosity and finally gets in.. !
I mean what ?
Where is the this which makes a Joker a Joker... ?The tight part of the movie starts slowly after Arthur kills his mother. That was really a violent but that maybe shows some of the glimpse ( we can say ) of the joker.After how he kills one of his friends in his house with the scissors... yeah that make a joker, but not, the whole movie was just wasted.
I am not saying that the movie should not contain the history or the background of him as how he came up here... Even I say the background of the character is the most interesting part but only if it is well developed.If he is the psycho or gets the one, it should be in the background or in his history how he came up with.In starting, he gives the card to the woman saying not to mind his as he laughs and can't stop it... and the he gets hurted by the group of boys for not giving the board back, and the starting stuff was really interesting... And that lasts it Arthur kills three people in the train ( yes the train scene was to be appreciated )
. After that the movie looses its weigh.In last when he gives the speech in the live show was the great as he was describing his life's point of view and his experiences throughout the life.
But repeatedly I say that - THAT such kind of thing should be in whole movie; like his likes and his attitude towards the society.When he kills the host of the show with the gun, was WOW... but Why can he bring his gun to anywhere ... ? How can he ? I think no one is checking him before going to anywhere. ( maybe he would have killed the Wayne in the Bathroom with his gun ! )
But hey, he acted Amazingly.
It really really feels like he can only be the joker.
The cinematography was the best all the color gradients and tones for mood .
Direction was too... but it was just a lack of a story writing.Needed some kind of the music in the background which played when he comes on the frame... Some kind of music that fits in the brain of the joker lovers and play repeatedly even for the motivation! ( What we do with the Batman rises' soundtrack )All I want to say is, whatever they showed in the last 1/3 of the movie, should be in the whole movie.( I don't get that why have they related this Joker with the Batman begins' joker story... ? Why a person kills Bruce Wayne's parents in the way showed in the batman.. ?If they really want to relate the joker with the one in the batman, then that joker had a background in which his father cut his lips... but in this Joker isn't !No guyz you can't relate... )But This movie was the first step in making the movie of the joker isolated.
Better version is Expected with above suggested advises.",7,3,5,7 December 2019
