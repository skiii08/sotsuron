Casablanca," ...............
","Little can be said that hasn't been already about this movie.People have waxed rhapsodical for decades (almost 6) about this film, and with good reason.I have yet to meet ANYONE who has seen this movie and not needed to reach for the Kleenex.This is the film that ALL movies would like to be when they grow up.No plot-critique here ..... if you haven't seen it, you are either a) an alien, b) born and raised in a pit deep in the bowels of the Earth, c) in a coma, or d) one of the brain-dead 'movie-goers' who watched Titanic 400 times and thought it was 'original'.THIS is the movie that James Cameron WISHED he had the skill to make!The budget? ... laughable.Probably less than Cameron spent on the 'authentic' White Star china for his dining scenes.The camera-work? .... 'Primitive' by most standards. The script and acting are what makes this a truly great film....( The raison d'etre for movies surely? )I'm sort of glad that movies will never be like this again.This is my personal yardstick. Yes, I have seen it on more than a few occasions, and yes I still reach for the Kleenex.(Oh yeah  ..... it's a great way for single guys to spend a night with their new belles and show 'em that they're 'sensitive' ....)Watch it .... don't watch it ... I don't care.Those who do come away with a different perspective on life and love and Nobility.Strange to think that Hollywood once considered that a good thing huh?",10,1,1,5 February 2001
We Were Soldiers," A Salute To Heroes.
","Not too many movies are made about the time America grew up and lost its soul, so when I saw how much flak this movie was catching, I HAD to find out why. The true story of Ia Drang is more harrowing than even this movie managed to depict, and those watching this and belittling it, and the actions of a few hundred men in fighting a battle few people knew or cared about until recently is the proof that America's Innocence died in 1965.Personal thoughts on the Viet Nam war notwithstanding, this IS the era that America turned from care-free and innocent to cynical and selfish. The decade that started with Kennedy and the Camelot Administration and ended with Watergate, Kent State, the Chicago Convention, and Altamont were the years that Americans should mourn more than any in their history. We went from 'Can-Do' to 'Screw You', and this was the main reason.While most people alive today weren't even born at the time the events in this movie took place, their prejudices and mind-sets are those instilled by the last 'innocent' generation (their parents usually) ..... and those who howl most and roll their eyes at 'yet ANOTHER Viet Nam movie' would also do well to remember that what they are really peeved about is not that another movie has been made about a war, but that a movie has been made that points out just what was lost to America and the world during this conflict.Until the events depicted here took place, Viet Nam was just another place where America was deploying troops. The days surrounding these events and the subsequent distress-call of 'Broken Arrow' brought home to the America and the world just how real the conflict was and how savage savage it would become.Having said all that, I was actually prepared to hate this movie just on account of who was in it and how much I disliked their more recent disastrous forays into the big-screen.Looking at the cast list, I was half-expecting this to be another garbage, high-budget movie whose cast was only there for their box-office appeal (Titanic, Braveheart, Signs, Vanilla Sky, etc.) and this was one of the reasons I resisted watching it.I was impressed with the choices for the main players - Sam Elliot as a tough old Sergeant-Major was quite a treat, and Mel Gibson has always been better in action-flicks. Seeing actors one usually doesn't associate with action/war movies  wearing uniforms is something of a shock, and at first I thought that they would appear out of their depth, but Greg Kinnear gave a good performance as Major Crandall - I've always thought helicopter-pilots were a little unzipped anyway, and I found his performance to be the most believable of all.There were moments that the movie didn't really need, and the syrup was laid on a little thick at the beginning, but all that aside, I enjoyed this flick.",Null,11,19,12 January 2004
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Plate
","*** WARNING: Spoilers enclosed. ***
This movie came out around the same time as Platoon, and I made the mistake of seeing Platoon first. After sitting through THAT garbage-pretending-to-be-a-movie, I decided that a) I wasn't EVER going to get the time back, and b) I was done with Viet Nam movies.So it was my misfortune that I had to wait until after this movie came out on video and I had a raging case of influenza before anyone could get me in the same room as this was being shown.It may have been the NyQuil, or it could have been the other non-prescription 'cold-remedies' that did it, but I actually laughed so much at this movie I almost puked!Okay, so I sobered up and watched it again a while later (didn't take me a while to sober up - just to watch it again!) and the funny thing was that I enjoyed it as much the second time - after I was able to hear the parts I roared with laughter at the first time I watched.Everyone has said something positive about R. Lee Ermey's performance, and I'm not going to be different - I didn't think it was possible to hear so much invective from one man in one sentence and keep a straight face, and even as jaded as I am, I can only look on in wonder and admiration at the passion he put into his part.Quick synopsis: Bunch of kids from all over the USA are sent to Parris Island for Marine training, most of them get through it, they go to Viet Nam, and some of 'em die.And if that was all the movie was about, it would still be a reasonable flick.Watching the characters develop, deciding who to hate and who to like, listening to R. Lee Ermey ('Here, you are all equally worthless' and 'Were you born worthless, or did you have to work at it?'), and finally seeing them become Marines were all very entertaining, but this was only the under-card for the main event: Viet Nam.Of course, through all the death, destruction, and carnage all around, we were still treated to moments that were so on the dark-side, they were actually hilarious.Papillon Soo was our 'introduction' to Joker's life 'In-Country' and apart from the much-quoted attempts to pick up the G.I's (Me love you LONG time), she was actually one of the most poised and least forced-looking of the cast, but even her appearance has a nasty undercurrent that took me two viewings to see.The black humor is more prevelent as the movie gets toward the end, and there are moments of pure madness that are so obscenely ridiculous they are probably closer to the truth than the more 'acceptable' scenes, but probably the funniest lines of all are from the second section of this movie ('You know there's not a single horse in the entire country of Vietnam? There's definitely something wrong with that.' and the ever-colourful Animal Mother's ideas on Patriotism: 'If I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word, my word is poontang.'All-in-all, this was funny, disgusting, sad, hilarious, sickening, and moving - all the things a great movie should be.The final scene, however, was probably the most poignant of any war-film made in a VERY long time - a bunch of kids with rifles marching through devastation singing and whistling the theme to the Mickey Mouse show .... we always revert to that which is most comfortable in times of greatest stress, and for this movie to end any other way would have weakened it to the levels of Platoon and Tour Of Duty.",Null,1,2,20 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Setback Of The Clowns.
","Well, this movie did for Star Wars what Rocky did for Artificial Insemination.The real problems with this film are not the things everyone hated about it - why should they have been surprised after the last diabolical piece of crap that Lucas threw to us like scraps from a table?This is another example of Hollywood Scizophrenia and too-big budgets.For whatever reason, instead of producing a Sci-Fi classic reminiscent of the Days Of Yore, Lucas gave us some kind of treacle-dripping love-story that was neither central to whatever plot there was or necessary for anything other than adding length and 'Depth' to what is otherwise an empty movie.For example, we are treated to a scene that seems to have been made for no other reason than to show what looks like a pteradactyl being piloted through a rainstorm .....  I guess it helped to pad out the almost 2 hours until the real Star Wars flick began .... what is truly unfortunate is that even the 6 or 7 minutes of 'real' Star Wars was overshadowed so completely by the schmaltz, wooden acting, see-through 'plot', stilted dialog, and completely-unnecessary 'love-interest'.To save everyone a lot of time, they should have showed 'Pretty Woman' and then trailers for the Return Of The Jedi  .... that's pretty much what this film came down to being in the end, and much as Star Wars purists hated it for the movie it never really was, I hated it for the movies that it was trying to be instead of trying to be a Star Wars which I thought was the whole idea of this multi-million dollar serving of warmed-over vomit.I look forward to the final episode almost as much as my next prostate exam with the almost certain knowledge that visiting the doctor WILL be less painful both to my body and my psyche.",Null,1,2,18 December 2003
Edward Scissorhands," The worst kind of garbage.
","Knowing beforehand who was in this movie and who directed it I was expecting a masterpiece of a movie, to rival the likes of Beetlejuice or Batman - instead, I had to sit and watch Johnny Depp do a reasonably good impression of a man with too many valium inside him and an over-abundance of 'mood-lighting' and misplaced SFX.It seems that everyone on the planet who has given an opinion but me loved this flick, and I think it must be something they were putting in the food at the time it was released or something, because nearly 14 years after I first saw this film, I am still trying to find something not to hate about it.I guess this is the culprit for allowing over-produced schmaltz to become 'blockbusters' and as such, Tim Burton should be sent immediately to Movie-Jail (without passing 'Go' and without collecting umpty-zillion dollars so that this kind of crap can NEVER be inflicted upon the world again!) After all, if the public would swallow this crap, they'd swallow ANY garbage that has a great director, a great producer, great cast, and a script that was written by a bunch of chimpanzees on Ecstacy.For more examples of the 'Written-By-Monkeys-On-Drugs' movies, I can highly recommend Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Cutthroat Island, and maybe Vanilla Sky or Batman & Robin ..... As an alternative to watching Edward Scissorhands or any of the other above-mentioned films, I could suggest laying in the road and letting someone beat you with a baseball bat as a better way to spend your time .... probably less painful and better for you in the long run.",Null,1,3,5 December 2003
The Fast and the Furious," HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!
","Wasn't this movie called 'Point Break' a few years ago? Had this movie been any more transparent I would have been able to see into the street through my television.That kid Paul Walker even SOUNDS a bit like Keanu Reeves.So I waited till it was in the video store till I watched it, and I'm glad I got it free ..... and I STILL feel robbed.They kinda wasted the talents of Vin Diesel and a couple of others, but generally this movie came off like a bunch of highschool kids had been let loose with some expensive film equpiment and about 300lbs of horse-tranquilizers. The plot (such as it is) is held together with Bondo and Duct-tape, and the few chances we saw to develop characters were left like road-kill along the wayside by overuse of 'mood' music shots of the sky!If you haven't seen this flick: save yourself the time, or get some Nitrous for yourself .... it'll lessen the pain this movie will inflict on your psyche.If you HAVE seen this film, then there are plenty of professionals trained to treat the trauma that experiences like this usually inflict on people.",Null,0,1,15 February 2002
Independence Day," Funny funny funny
","I almost got thrown out of the cinema for laughing at this movie.I don't think I was SUPPOSED to be laughing uproariously for the first 25 minutes of the movie, but it was just so silly!Let's look at this for a few seconds, and mayhap you will understand.There's this very large alien ship 'A quarter the mass of our Moon' according to one scientist.It then arrives in orbit around our wee blue rock and proceeds to dispatch loads of smaller ships (about the size of New York City) to destroy the major population-centres on Earth.After releasing the Death-ray which levels the world's largest cities with one shot, the U.S Air Force send (*gasp*) Will Smith and his squadron of F-18s up at them.Not only do the Sidewinder missiles completely fail to bring down this flying megalith (remember, it's bigger than some countries!!), but everyone is surprised .... nay, shocked! when the missiles fail to even HIT the damn' thing!Who would have thunk that a species with the technology to build a ship of such awe-inspiring size, fill it with billions of genocidal aliens, and catapult it across the Galaxy would never have heard of force-fields ?!?!?!?!?!?!?So .... that kind of sets the tone for the entire movie.It does have it's high-points however.Bill Pullman and Mary McDonnell appear to have been born for their roles in this movie, and the Will Smith/Jeff Goldblum double-act was well worth watching a few dozen times.Randy Quaid was the man to whom this movie belonged, however. Few people can make you howl with laughter and choke with tears in the same scene.A lot of schmaltz seemed to have been added in for no apparent reason, Bill Pullman quoting Dylan Thomas for example, yet I think that maybe even Thomas would have been moved to want to destroy the Alien Scum after listening to 'Mr President' talking to Humankind.One has to remember that when this movie was made, America was in political turmoil and needed to 'feel-good' about itsself, and this movie delivered the goods.From the young president with the beautiful wife (who wasn't messing around with the help) to the howlingly funny Will Smith beating up on 'his' alien in the desert, this movie will continue to make people laugh for years to come.The real low points, though, were the capricious use of the dog and the children.Otherwise a fun movie.",Null,1,2,5 February 2001
Titanic," Possibly THE WORST movie EVER to have been made.
","If that doesn't say it, then let me share one or two thoughts as to why this should NEVER have been made. Firstly, what drugs does one have to be injecting to be able to take one of the worst human tragedies and make a love-story with the acting equivalent of Twinkies as the leads?I mean, they were nice and sweet to look at, but just like Hostess' most famous product, one is always left with a few lingering questions: 1) 'Is That It?' 2) 'What's This Nasty Aftertaste?' 3) 'Why?'This movie was the cinematic equivalent of elective plastic-surgery: Pointless, painful, expensive, and it leaves scars that may never quite heal.I know for an absolute certainty that my views will be frowned upon by the clueless who still think that Leonardo was on the boat when it actually sailed, and also by the educationally-sub-normal among the movie-going public who seem to think that ANY old garbage will do as long as it has great SFX and a chick with a nice chest to look at. I know all that. I am also aware that this self-indulgent piece of garbage was one of the biggest-grossing Box-Office movies ever.It still doesn't detract from the fact that it was 3 hours too long and makes a mockery of the awful deaths of 1,500 people. What's next?Maybe James Cameron will get Ricky Martin and Christina Aguillera to star in 'Belsen: The Musical' !!!!",Null,2,4,4 February 2001
Signs," A new low in Hollywood Hype.
","This is another gruesome Hollywood tale of awesome talent put to awful waste. I knew nothing about this movie going in, apart from that it had Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix in it - usually that would be enough to make a good flick. This time, however, all that transpired was about two hours of constantly waiting for something to happen. I'm not going to waste my time with an outline - after all if the people who made it didn't bother giving it a recognizable plot, why should we bother trying to find one? Maybe I missed the bits that were 'scary' or something, and I DEFINITELY missed finding any real point in this meandering odyssey to nowhere. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that hopefully the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys might one day give this garbage their special treatment.",Null,1,1,2 October 2003

","Val Kilmer, Al Pacino, Robet DeNiro, Tom Sizemore, John Voight, Ashley Judd.....The cast of this movie reads like a page out of mythology for movie-goers.I could wax lyrical about this movie for days without repeating myself, and STILL not do it justice.Calculators and digital watches may go to Silicon-Heaven, dogs may go to Puppy-Heaven.Heaven for lovers of outstanding flicks is Heat.",Null,0,0,14 April 2001
Braveheart," Oh my Gods!
","Mel Gibson didn't need the money THAT badly did he?Where do we start to tell the tales of woe that surround and ultimately crush this tripe?This movie has been made before. 'strue.Only the last time you saw it, it was called Little Big Man or something just as banal.Forget the fact that the only apparent link between the film and the facts is that it has a character called William Wallace in it.Forget that the French princess was only about eight years old at the time.Forget that that Scottish twit of a king was but a mere teenager when all this was supposed to have happened.This movie is 'Titanic' without the ship!!!I think Mel Gibson was probably abducted by aliens immediately prior to the making of this movie and returned as a kill-bot or something.(What ... you think you could come up with a BETTER explanation for his fall from Grace?)Gibson seems to have James-Cameron-Disease (A rare and sadly non-fatal malady from the late 20th Century that causes great film-makers to turn into mindless cretins who have all the creative talents of Pluto the Dog!!)Another Hollywood propaganda movie here ....Spot the exceptionally bad accents (yeah .... it makes your ears hurt after a while, listening to foreigners trying to be a Scot)Here's my theory on this movie:They took the plots from Highlander, Pale Rider, The Magnificent Seven, and a host of other great movies. Then they got Peewee Hermann, Coco The Clown, Lassie, and Bill Clinton's Speech-writer to re-hash it. They then managed to con Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles into producing and directing it.THEN they had the Spice Girls do post-production, just to polish it up.Well, it certainly SEEMS that way.If anyone can come up with a better version of how/why this movie was released, I'd be MORE than happy to hear it.
Overall, it was about as exciting as watching my hair turn grey, and about as mentally-stimulating as 3 dozen Valium.How sad that one of Scotland's greatest sons was turned into Mad Max while his story was turned into THIS cinematographic torture-chamber.Oh yeah .... one final thought.The guy who wrote this movie was on TV recently saying that he firmly believes himself a  descendant of William Wallace (a man who supposedly died childless!!) and because nobody can prove otherwise, that's his story and he's sticking to it.Pretty much like David Koresh saying that he is Jesus because nobody can prove otherwise!!Says it all really, huh?",Null,2,5,4 February 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Just ..... funny
","Okay, so maybe George Clooney has 'grown up' in Hollywood?How nice to see a cast of good actors in a movie that deserves their talents.George Clooney, of course, just seems to get better and better. He has redeemed himself in this movie for all his sins involving the desert and any kind of uniform.He couldn't have done it on his own (who could?), and it seems the Movie Gods were smiling on us all when this film was in production.This is a polished movie that exceeds mere funny by several orders of magnitude, ascending to knew depths of depravity and new heights of humor often in the same scene.If you haven't seen it, I'm not going to spoil it for you by telling you the plot. If you have seen it and didn't get it, well .... it's your loss.",Null,0,0,12 February 2001
