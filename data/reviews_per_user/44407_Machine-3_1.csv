The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely terrifying!
","It'll be a long time before I go camping in the woods!  The acting in this movie was quite real and the film had such style. No a typical 'horror' flick, just honest terror.  They didn't resort to cheap surprises, just a great story.  Very well coordinated.  See it!",10,1,2,21 July 1999
