The Equalizer," Entertaining but nothing more
","It's just another entertaining action movie, no complicated plot and sometimes it doesn't even make sense, but it will if you just shut your mind,fairly predictable, some scenes are interesting while other ones are completely ridiculous, like when Denzel's character tortures a guy by putting him on a car and filling it with smoke, a 'guy who would never break' apparently the only thing he doesn't break is the window of the car, or at least put your arm before it closes its certainly not gonna chop your arm off. Anyway Denzel is the usual bad ass he plays on most of his movies, you know that always calm guy that makes unusual things making you think hes insane and capable of anything, which for me is kind of getting old.The only way to enjoy this movie is to set your mind back as if you're twelve years old and never have watched a Denzel Washington movie",6,0,3,6 October 2014
The Maze Runner," Better than I expected
","I thought it was just gonna be another twilight bullshit or hunger games movie, which it kind of is but in a good way, it's not as predictable as i thought it would be, but there are some ridiculous stuff in there too, put a bunch of young guys on an isolated space for 3 years or more and i'm supposed to believe nobody tried to have sex with the only girl which on top is hot as hell? and where the hell was she getting so many rocks she threw when she was on top of the isolated wooden structure? who even let her in there in the first place? anyway besides some minor points it's worth watching and it seems like it will get better on the sequel, but let's just wait and see",7,0,2,6 October 2014
Interstellar," Another masterpiece by the best director of our time
","Yes I'm a Nolan fan, with good reason, he never fails to disappoint, every time I watch a movie by him, I end mesmerized and find myself thinking about what I just saw and then watch it again.Of course Hans Zimmer makes another perfect score as well, perfectly captures all the emotions we should feel when we should feel them.They both deserve Oscars and any award they will be nominated nothing will be able to beat this not even in a decade, unless another Nolan film of course.Anyone who gives a bad review can be one of 3 reasons, one and probably the most common, they crave for attention and giving a bad review to an excellent movie achieves that, second reason is that they have psychologically blocked their minds into hating whatever is wildly popular, in other words, a hipster of some sort. And lastly, the third reason is just that they are too dumb to understand and appreciate the beauty of this movie. In either of the 3 cases any review should be dismissed so the only reason you should listen to them, is to not get over hyped by the movie to make it even more awesome, because even if you are, you will still like it.",10,1,6,25 November 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," I understand why people love it, but...
","First of I'd like to say I did liked the movie, it was better than I expected it to be, and for the amount of characters they were very well handled for the most part. The problem is Marvel in general, they have managed to do a giant TV series, some episodes are good, some are straight up bad, but they keep you hooked and basically force you to watch all the movies to enjoy this one, you see, this movie will not age well, simply because as a stand alone, it is not a good movie, people defending it has a plot, no it does not, the plot is the entire marvel universe, but the movie has very little and at times inconsistent plot, as an example how come Vision was probably THE most powerful avenger in Civil War having the mind stone and all and in this movie is a complete rookie who needs saving by a simply enhanced human, but I wont get into much detail on the inconsistencies, the movie works because its fan base are blind to what a good movie should be when it comes to marvel, granted Marvel is not meant to be a Dark Knight Trilogy, its made to entertain more simple minded audience and as I said it is enjoyable to watch, but only if you watched everything else and you shut your brain a little bit to not get annoyed by the inconsistencies and lack of plot or good script.The other thing I wish would have impacted me more (SPOILER) are the deaths, I felt nothing from anyone dying in this movie, and before you say Im just stone cold hearted it's not because of that, Marley and me did made me cry for example, the problem was that none of the deaths feel permanent, not even Gamora which was the saddest death anyway, but I believe she is simply trapped in the soulstone and they can still get her back somehow for guardians of the galaxy 3, thats the other thing, you see all these movies planned with characters that are supposedly dead it's hard to believe they are really gone for good, Marvel has become famous for never actually killing its characters or rarely and only when they dont serve any purpose, compare any of them to the death of Rachel on TDK, that death alone had more impact than all these deaths combinedWith all that said, it was certainly an enjoyable movie, just not as much as people claim it is, this movie deserves an 8 at most but probably a 7.5 would be a better fit, 5 being an okay movie you did not hate but forgot you even saw, 10 being masterpiece 7.5 is good and memorable but no close to a masterpiece",7,1,3,11 May 2018
The Dark Knight," Simply the best there is
","I have always been a Nolan fan for obvious reasons, he is one of the few directors who can tell a fantastic story with such detail, great philosophy that leaves you thinking long after you finished watching, always great casting, with this particular one having a legendary performance by heath ledger, powerful unexpected scenes and coherent twists, some of which remain hidden in plain sight until the climax, grounded universe, always explainable and easy to digest, but the more you watch them, the more you discover from them. That being said, this one has everything Nolan is known for and probably his best work to date but even if you talk about his worst is still better than most director's best movies. I will never be able to understand why this movie was not even considered for best picture at the Oscars, lost my faith in the Oscars that day, still it feels good when they recognize a great film because like it or not, that movie will go down in history.Anyway, I'll save what countless other good critics have said about the movie here, I can only say that this is a true masterpiece in every way despite what any person has to say about why is not a masterpiece or let alone a bad movie, those people have lost any credibility on anything they have to say about any other movie weather is good or badAs any Nolan Film 10/10 though i might give this one an 11 if i could",10,1,5,17 November 2014
Joker," Good, but not as good as I wanted it to be
","I would give it a 7 or 8 at most, but too many 10's and 'Masterpiece', 'Best joker' reviews made me feel like I need to point out what is wrong with it and why this hyped reviews are wrong.First off the movie is not at all bad, I have been pretty sick of cliche superhero movies lately and this is a very nice change, just not an awesome one. I went in with full expectation I would like the movie seeing all those reviews, maybe they raised my expectations too high. I felt I saw a very classic story of a bullied man turned mad, nothing special about the overall plot, its not complicated, is not philosophical, no memorable, impactful dialogues, monologues, or even phrases it doesn't give you much more to think about than 'Bullying is bad'Now to the real gems of the movie Acting, Cinematography and Score. The acting was great, but not as great as people say, I have seen enough movies to know excellent acting when I see it, in simple terms, you must not see the actor, but the character at all times even if you are trying to see the actor, like Christian Bale in 'The Fighter'. That masterclass is what I was hoping here knowing Joaquin Phoenix capacity as an actor, as demonstrated in 'The Master', and though there were times this was true, there were times it just felt like he was trying too hard to be a maniac, it did not feel as natural as I hoped it to be, and it may be Phillips' fault here since he is not very experienced directing masterclass actors or maybe even recognizing masterclass acting.For the Cinematography, There were some genuinely beautiful shots in this movie, many of the shots felt like a comic book frame, the only thing I would complain about is that I did not feel like any of them really stood out, I did not feel any of them gave us any kind of subtext that gave us more information, more to think about or even simply hypnotizing enough to be called masterclass, I may need to watch it again with more attention to be sure, but overall it was great and definitely one of the better elements of the filmNow for the score, for me probably the best element of the film, it does really capture the haunting feeling of being alone, sad and insane at the same time and without it, the best scenes of the film would not have been as great as they are. but as much as I loved it, I still would think hard considering it 'Masterclass' though I would give this element a 9/10 without thinking too hardI really wish this movie is as great as people say, I really believed the hype, but I sometimes forget that I may have seen more films than the average person to see the flaws not many people seem to find, in a way is sad because I know I will never be easily satisfied with a movie the way I did when I was a kid.Im giving the film a 3, but only trying to balance out the undeserved many 10 reviews it has, the film should not have more than an 8 at most",1,22,65,8 October 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great acting, same great camera work as gravity, but painfully boring
","I will start off by saying that i have never been a fan of Iñarritú's movies, even if I'm also Mexican, I prefer Cuarón any day. With that being said, looking at reviews and that fact that this is indeed a very different movie than his previous work doing comedy for the first time, working with A-list actors I like, whom by the way acted spectacular, I decided to give it a chance and I really wanted to like this one. I was disappointed, again, but at least I can say this is the one I have enjoyed the most, still, comedy? no, I barely chuckled in a couple scenes, masterpiece? not even close, the only people that can even consider it a masterpiece are hipsters, critics, and people out of place that like hating what is mainstream and love weird unpopular stuff. I bet half of these so called critics hated Interstellar and loved this one. What can I never understand is criticism, like in the Oscars, why didn't even consider The Dark Knight to be nominated? being clearly one of the best pictures of all time. Anyway that is another story.I'm giving this film a 5, because of the superb acting and camera- work, but the 'humor', story, even the 'hipster' music and overall impact deserves nothing",6,12,28,17 November 2014
