The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project is an excellent film!
","I saw The Blair Witch Project at a preview screening and was completely surprised by this film.  I didn't really know anything about the film before I went to it and it ended up being a great movie.  This film is different than any other horror film I've seen recently.  The only thing you need to know about this film before seeing it is that it's scary.  Oh, and don't plan to go camping soon after seeing it.",10,1,2,29 June 1999
