The Perks of Being a Wallflower," 'I gave her my heart, she gave me a typewriter.'
","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' wins the heart of many viewers seeking a film with genuine teen melodrama. Sure, the concept of the film may be hackneyed, but with a bolstered star-power from the casts, and a plausible script, it surpasses another coming-for-age substance on the silver screen. Filmed in the traditional John Hughes and Cameron Crowe style, it's probably nostalgic for some, but nevertheless overwhelming and heartfelt. I never been this instantly hooked for a teen drama film like this before, it's like everything about the genre is getting so much better as the year passes by. Though it's the last teen movie for 2012 to be a clever one, it's impossible to look for a film like this for another year or two.Logan Lerman plays as Charlie, a young man who's pressured for his first day in high school. He's subtle but rather awkward in making friends. As any teen that has new doors to go in, Logan partakes a test in high school life. His first and the only closest friend on his earlier days where his English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd). They're both connected in the same page, and they're also indebted in reading the classics.Not long after Charlie's melancholic episode, he befriends one of his classmates named Patrick during a football game. Patrick is a funny senior student with an offbeat humor. And then later on, his step-sister Sam (Emma Watson). The trio have made an intimate friendship ever since, and that's the obvious part. Charlie has had the impression that Patrick and Sam were a couple, but Sam explains that they weren't. So what unfolds is that Charlie will start to get in love with Sam. In addition, Patrick turns out to be gay and is in love with a football jock (Johnny Simmons). Before Charlie starts getting the ideal attention, there were fleeting series of flashbacks about his aunt which died in a car accident. Charlie have been bearing the pain ever since, so he has been acting very differently. But all of this he can't forget. Instead, he relied on the support of being a wallflower among his friend. This has become immediately effective because of the sympathizing monument.'Perks' is a strong film about strong characters which thoroughly exists beyond our own self. Part of me tells that the narrative is impossible to resist. It's embedded with nuances and dramatization which we can recognize easily. It can make you cry, pitiful, and make you develop this longing which the characters feel to maintain their friendship together. There is one scene in the film where I consider really sweet and sublime: Where Charlie and Sam develop a sense of hesitation but turns out that Sam really wants to love him at their brief moment alone together. I felt for the actors' persona on-screen. Logan Lerman, whom the last well known project to be the Percy Jackson film attains a fresh coming- for-age male breakthrough performance. He's quite funny and also quite the gentleman, but some of his stubborn dialogue is a downer. Emma Watson ignores the commotion that surrounds her about her Brit qualities. Instead, she perfected to be on an American shoes like how Meryl Streep mastered plenty of accents on many of her films. Lastly, Ezra Miller gave a great feel of being a profound alpha-male bravado. It's funny that the trio develop an unadulterated chemistry which is appealing in the eyes and ears. It's all in shape and form, there's no denying it.The director, Steven Chbosky (based on his book) has written an incredible and profound story with believable materials and voice. He attributes Cameron Crowe with John Hughes into something less generic. The chosen setting for the film was 1990s, but to make it more alive, Chbosky hired Michael Brook to pump some great tunes including The Smiths and David Bowie. As a whole, the film has proved itself to be perhaps a Golden Globe nominee.",10,4,10,5 January 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Indeed amazing with a large dose of CGI and long runtime.
","It is very understandable why Sony Pictures got the idea of adding the word amazing for the next Spidey film. Probably because Sam Raimi, the director of the previous films gave up for a fourth film. Now in the helm of (500) Days of Summer director Marc Webb, the new Spider-Man gets its new magic touch. Webb was also given an opportunity to direct Spider-Man (2001) before. And it's quite a welcoming for having this opportunity the second time around. His version of the Spidey reboot is embedded with sharp characterization, spoonful of backstory, and fresh performance from young and aged actors.As a teenager, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a science student in high school where he's bullied by Flash (Chris Zylka), and later on befriends with the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). It's obvious that the squeeze of Peter is going to be Gwen, considering that it was Mary Jane to be first on the film's predecessor.Peter lives a struggled life after his parents Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz) left. Now in the hands of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), his ambiguity about his parents' disappearance remains unanswered. But soon, Peter is eager to investigate further about his parents' absence, and later finds out that his father is a colleague of Dr. Curt Connors. Moreover, he discovers a scientific formula that Connors and his father have worked on.On the other hand, Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) of the OsCorp lab is working on a serum to regenerate limbs, particularly his right arm. Peter finds out that he's still working on the formula for his sake, and Connors gives Peter an opportunity to work together to develop the cure. But it turns out to be a tragedy when Peter realizes that he's collided with Connors' dire obsession and leads him to his great responsibility.Dr. Connors is in actual fact The Lizard, the new villain of the film. It's quite easy to guess how he becomes Spider-Man's enemy. It's a clash of prey and predator sort of exploit. I like the fact that in reality, the spider and the lizard make good enemies on the wall or roof. It's whimsical at that point, but the CGI is bloated with it and it deceives the eye. I can't blame the film for not using too much special effects. Unlike Christopher Nolan's hatred for using VFX in his Batman films, I wish they were stimulated to make the reboot no simpler like what he did to impress me.However, I like how the narrative where structured carefully to provide many details of Peter's background. It's very patient, but less stirring nevertheless, giving a painful 134 runtime. I hope they made some good exposition in the first act. In the second act, it gives a slow-burn feel, making you laugh more than thrilled. The script wasn't that bad. With three scribes James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves (Harry Potter screenwriter), they combine an elaborative story and hilarious quips to maintain the film alive and welcoming. But the problem is, I have seen this before. There are more obvious points than original.The casting is quite a surprising treat, with Andrew Garfield on board, which made a good performance in The Social Network. I admired Emma Stone more than I like her, maybe Amanda Seyfried could've been a good Gwen Stacy, but I accepted her. Martin Sheen maintains a strong character of Uncle Ben, probably better than Cliff Robertson. The same goes to Sally Fields as Aunt May as well. Lastly, the role of Denis Leary as Captain Stacy is a serious persona for Peter in maintaining a balanced relationship in character. As a whole, for passing what superhero films should have, The Amazing Spider-Man is actually fine. With a well-picked cast and a stunning remake, the film is worth the shot if you're up for a new Spidey universe. But then again, the hype is becoming like Sam Raimi's.",6,0,1,7 January 2013
Django Unchained," The D is Silent, Hell yeah.
","After Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, which packed an irresistible powerful punch three years ago, he establishes a great imprint of what his customers were looking for on a video store when he was working for one. Yes, it's the Spaghetti Western flicks, and now it's a bloody wish fulfillment. Django Unchained is one of Tarantino's greatest passions in Western flicks. Whether you're just starting to get to know QT, Django perhaps is a great way to start. Much has been said about Tarantino's portrayal of gore, mayhem and relentless moments, he transform it in forms of merriment. Like any films in the director's filmography, it's full of hilarious moments which came from his own correspondence. And most of all, the film is peppered with his own music collection: From Johnny Cash to John Legend, and wait, from rapper RZA? That's just funny, but tolerable.Tarantino's script is also patient and edifying. It's in no hurry to show what QT fans are waiting for. Obviously, every Tarantino films are comprised with slow-burn dialogues because it's funny how smart and mad he is about the movies. It serves as a retaliation of what he likes and what he doesn't like and I don't blame him for it. We can never be defiant in Tarantino's universe, we owe a lot to him, and he's just doing the favor.The film starts in 1858 in Texas, two years before the Civil War. Django (Jamie Foxx) and a number of chained slaves have been a victim of slavery and was bought by the Speck Brothers (James Remar and James Russo). Meanwhile, a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) confronts the brothers and frees Django. The reason that Schultz chooses Django is because the latter says he knows the Brittle Brothers, perhaps Schultz next move. As Django agrees to help Schultz in bounty-hunting, they first embark to confront the Brittle Brothers. Afterwards, it leads Django to become Schultz's associate in bounty-hunting across Texas. From there, Django discovers his forte: For wielding pistol in cowboy style, and shooting rifles (even magnum and shotguns) on intimate long range.Django also explains to Schultz that his wife Bloomhilda Von Shaft (Kerry Washington) is also sold in slavery in Mississippi. Her current owner is a man named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a plantation owner, and an audacious man. His slaves, probably the Mandingo people, are forced to fight each other. The duo plans a plot to rescue Bloomhilda from Candie by pretending to negotiate in buying one of his fight slaves, but consider in proposing to buy Bloomhilda instead. I imagine it to be very lucrative, but I also imagine Candie to be like Col. Hans Landa from Inglorious Basterds. The deal is terrifying and so is the suspenseful notion.Here is a film that looks absolutely fantastic, shot wonderfully but also superbly constructed from the ground up. The costume design and production values make a comeback in the likes of Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Tarantino never hesitated to bring it back to life and keep piling all of what he likes on a Spaghetti Western flick. In addition, the Blaxploitation is stunningly awesome, with its over- the-top gritty performance, and of course the mayhem, and the 'n' word madness. It is noticeable that one of QTs film trademark is quick zooms, and rotating camera pans from his collaborator DP Robert Richardson. In addition, the film is still successfully edited even though QTs collaborator in editing, the late Sally Menke wasn't there anymore. The film's vehemence is fresh but rather unoriginal. Tarantino wanted the violence to be relentless like his partner in crime Robert Rodriguez did with his Grindhouse (2007) feature header 'Planet Terror'. He planted the idea that stunt performers must have blood bags to imitate oozing gunshots and make it an extreme action exploit. But who cares, it's kind of fun ain't it? Black folks shooting all folks?Aside from the action, it also balances drama and romance. Think of it like the late Tony Scott's film 'True Romance' (1993), where Tarantino made the script, and it came from his true voice. It was romantic and appealing, a story about a bimbo-cum-best-pal hooker and a man who falls in love with her. I love the impression that Tarantino made an actually romantic clash between Django and Bloomhilda. It's not just a freedom from slavery which actually historical, but it's also a deliverance from suffering and nightmare of being a slave.The actors made such winning performance as always. Leo DiCaprio, as I've said, steps in Christoph Waltz's much terrifying performance like that of being a Hans Landa on screen. He's terrifying as Candie, making him a solid Oscar contender for it. For Django, there're plenty of great black actors in mind, but I'm not saying that Jamie Foxx isn't the greatest. I accepted him for what he is as Django. His character is a comeback that the Django name in films must once more reign supreme. However, Sam Jackson is suited more like a comedian with a Southern accent in the film. His performance is somewhat inevitable, he dress as the good guy suspecting the protagonists as bad guys. But wow, what a performance.Django is probably the greatest smart-ass Spaghetti Western royale that Tarantino crafted. If not one of his greatest in the filmography, then it's one of his finest achievement ever since he became a director himself.",10,0,4,6 January 2013
Kick-Ass," This film really kick-ass!!
","I had planned to watch this film on Friday, since there were no class on Saturday.The film started to Dave Lizewski as his alter-ego Kick-Ass. Normally he's a teenage boy obsessed in comic books and all the superheroes, and planning to be one of them. How could possibly he can become a superhero and a bad-ass without powers? This film has the humor, and the action that all the ages would demand.Few of the characters that are played successfully are Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage's character as Hit Girl and Big Daddy. My brother and I laughed and buckled in our seats since this film rocks.10/10",10,4,8,26 June 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," An exhilarating man-hunt phenomenon.
","Zero Dark Thirty is possibly another great breakthrough film by director Kathryn Bigelow. It's about the hunt for the infamous terrorist Osama bin laden, which was dead as we all know. The purpose of marketing this film is because of how nerve-wracking it was to know that Bin Laden is finally been dealt with and people would be eager to find out on how did the ambush became successful. Like myself, I am eager to explore the dangers and the accomplishments that the Americans risked to be involved in the most successful manhunt in the US history.The film is not only great at dramatization purpose, it's also great journalism. The film starts with a concise dash of the 9/11 bombing which was lately rumored that Bin Laden was on play. Then two years later, a lone-wolf CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) is focusing solely on the al-Qaeda who has spent her entire career for it. She is assigned to work with Dan (Jason Clarke) on a black site in Pakistan to interrogate Anmar (Reda Kateb) to who has several links with Saudi Arabian bombings.Chastain's uses her acute awareness of every facial expression and vocal intonation to humanize and add authenticity to a defiant, hard-nosed CIA analyst who tells the US Secretary of Defense, 'I'm the mot***r who found this place (Bin Laden's hideout).'Maya is not a young woman you would care to have a dinner conversation with but she does have a no bullsh*t attitude needed to hunt down the elusive Bin Laden in a country she offhandedly describes as 'kinda all f***ed up'. Over the course of the decade long manhunt, Maya transforms into a post 9/11 Captain Ahab of sorts. According to the movie's director, Maya is a fictional character partly based on a CIA operative that led the US Navy Seal team that killed Bin Laden.Zero Dark Thirty is directed by Academy Award winner Kathryn Bigelow and written by Marc Boal, the same team behind 2008's The Hurt Locker. There has been controversy that the duo received 'top-level access to the most classified information in history' as well as over the film's graphic use of torture from sexual humiliation, waterboarding, confinement in a tiny box to bloodied beatings.Several inaccuracies in the portrayal of enhanced interrogation techniques have been cited by a CIA veteran and concerns have been raised that the movie promotes the use of torture. Bigelow has responded to these criticisms stating that depiction of torture is not an endorsement and reiterated Boal's comment that the movie is 'not a documentary'.Screenwriter Marc Boal does a commendable job of condensing 10 years of intelligence gathering into a 2 ½ hour thriller. Though the first half of the movie does stretch a bit too long, the momentum immediately picks up once Maya locates the courier who leads the CIA to a compound in Pakistan.It's fascinating how the CIA exhausted all possibilities in their attempt to determine the identity of an unknown third adult male living in the compound. The CIA considered obtaining DNA, such as from a toothbrush, but all the garbage was burnt. When their target stepped outside for fresh air, he was always hidden under the cover of thick leaves in the garden. They even started a vaccination program and sent a doctor to the house to get blood samples.It's interesting to note that this movie was in development for many years and that the ending was rewritten due to the successful mission last May that killed the al Qaeda leader. The last half hour of the movie, as the US Navy Seals assaulted the hideout in the dead of night, is an incredibly riveting and suspenseful movie experience even when we know how it ends. It's hard to imagine how else the movie could have concluded.However, above all else, the only memorable moment of the film is the final payoff, no doubt about that. Many viewers will think of this as just a predictable notion of a movie where Bin Laden will die. It's hard to make a film about something that just happened which makes the resulting action inevitable, but the whole narrative is compelling and less jaded despite this criticism.The death of Bin Laden brings a certain sense of closure to Americans as well as for Maya having spent a decade of her life hunting the world's most wanted terrorist. In the final scene, she boards an empty military plane and the pilot asks the lone passenger 'Where do you want to go?'. She takes a moment for reflection. As she is overcome with emotions and thoughts, tears start to run down her cheeks. So where do we go from here?",7,31,58,13 January 2013
Never Back Down," A bone crunching and thrilling B-movie grit.
","Even though it isn't pleasant surprise, Never Back Down delivers what it promises. The film is never boring, because it's the encore and energy makes it in guilty-pleasure form. Some may not like this film unless you're a MMA or pro-wrestling fan. Rest assured, this movie may satisfy weekend viewers. Enter Jake Tyler (Sean Faris), an Iowa football jock that was forced to move to Orlando with his family. As a grieving fatherless son, he became taunted by the past and became somewhat the rebellious man any. Upon moving, he became unexpectedly infamous for being the most popular brawler from his last home before Iowa. With the voluptuous Baja (Amber Heard), she invites Jake into something which is unbeknownst to him. He thought it was just a party, but it turns out to be a pretty disastrous moment. With this, he meets his match, the anti-hero Ryan Mccarthy (Cam Gigandet). Ryan is the most popular fighter in Jake's new school, and is about to test how good the Iowa guy is. But since Jake doesn't know how to fight Ryan, expect that he will be forced to seek the help of an instructor. For instance, Djimon Honsou as Jean Roqua, he will teach Jake how to prepare against Ryan. But Roqua has one rule, no fighting outside the gym. Otherwise, he's out. Expect rules to be broken. But I guess I'll leave the rest to you.The role of Jake would've been suitable for actors like Dolph Lundgren or Mark Wahlberg, if the narrative wasn't casted for young actors such as Faris himself. Amber Heard wasn't such bad in this movie. She's good trying to be a what-not, from-bimbo-to-best-pal character. Her supporting lead is particularly intriguing, if not so good. And Gigandet obtains sarcastic, trigger-happy like attitude which is well executed. He's one of the best bad villains that gives cheap thrills and taunts. My personal choice to play Roqua would be Dwayne Johnson, But Honsou is preferable for the part.Never Back Down takes its time to be inevitable, but it doesn't mean it's not a good movie. The bone-crunching fight scenes and martial-arts violence is a hit-and-miss. But I found myself thrilled and respecting it's time for stupidity. Fueled by Michael Wandmacher's soundtrack, the script by Chris Hauty and Jeff Wadlow's direction make a good combination on how to survive a dog-eats-dog territory. That's what I like about good cheap with B-picture grit. Think of this film as the modern Karate Kid. However, there's no wax-on-wax-off in the plot, there's only excessive breathing to remember.",7,0,1,21 December 2012
The Social Network," A Prolific Review: The Social Network
","Imagine a 500 million users active in a social networking site that beats the competition. Isn't that a perception that we are willing to receive? Or we need to take the risk to do a lot of bad habits just to improve the creation that a person is really passionate about? Mark Zuckerberg (the real one) falls into this category, but he made his creation millions of milestones worldwide. But before he made his dorm room project called Facebook, the law was definitely against him.The Social Network is based on a biographical book The Accidental Billionaires written by non-fiction author Ben Mezrich who also wrote Bringing Down The House and also titled differently as 21. The film plots about Mark Zuckerberg's (Jesse Eisenberg) revenge on his girlfriend by getting wasted on his college dorm room and starting to hack his way on a website called FaceMash that is similar to HotorNot, and comparing her to farm animals by hacking through a bunch of photos on Face Books on Harvard. He was aided by Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield). As a hacking prodigy, he was sued by the Harvard community for an intrusion from the university's computers. Started only as an offensive idea, but it occurred to Zuckerberg that the fact is that there is a fascinating idea behind FaceMash. Afterwards, Zuckerberg's programming skills were recognized by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Nerendra whom are students in Harvard and asks for writing codes for a social networking site called HarvardConnection but will use the domain from Harvard's website. But later on, Zuckerberg tend to ignore Winklevoss' idea and turn it into a social networking site that was only exclusive to Harvard students. And he was aided by his dorm room friends particularly Chris Hughes, and Dustin Moskovitz. It turn's out that they failed to privately secure the site to Harvard studs and it was exclusive to all prestigious universities. As the company grew, it reveals that what they were aiming is all about the money and business.It is completely based on the book which was quite a false biographical statement. Zuckerberg never took revenge to his girlfriend. His idea for FaceMash were only for fun according from an interview. But it was completely offensive, yes. And Zuckerberg apologized publicly for that. In amidst of accepting the help of the Winklevoss' he was also accused of stealing an idea for a social network. He was hacker, but not a stealer. He created a social networking site called thefacebook back in 2005 and ranked to be the most visited social network exclusively to college studs and later on to all of ages. And the whole wide web is patronizing the only social network that beats Friendster and MySpace which were a former bright companies. It is now called Facebook.Furthermore, this film gave a lot of impact to the real CEO of Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg never liked this film, because they made it while he was still living. And he didn't want his fidelity to be revealed. Writer Aaron Sorkin also made the whole story to fictional and his naivete insulted Zuckerberg a little bit. This was a good biographical film that David Fincher directed after all, as in Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button that garnered Oscar awards. Facebook already won the heart of the world wide web. The question is, will it win the heart of the 2011 Golden Globes or the Oscars?",9,0,0,13 January 2011
