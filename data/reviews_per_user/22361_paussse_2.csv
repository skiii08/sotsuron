Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," no charm, forced humour & detective part replaced by running around and action
","What a pity that such a complicated and complex character is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. and in the hands of Guy Richie. It could and should have been an deep, intelligent, complex, wit and promising theme for a movie...The humour is forced, shallow and lame, there is a plot but it is not represented in the rank of Sherlock Holmes class....it's all mixed up and I don't like the result. The detective part of the story is lost and shallow and is replaced by running around and action...WOULDN'T WATCH IT TWICE!...where is the detective charm of the story?
