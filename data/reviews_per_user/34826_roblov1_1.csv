10 Cloverfield Lane," Short review and no spoilers.
","This movie started with a preliminary title called The Cellar and it would've been a fantastic name for the film. It's dark, creepy, bordering on claustrophobic where every moment keeps you in a state of near tension as to what is going to happen next. I cannot state how impressive John Goodman is in this film. His acting range is beyond that of almost any I can think of at the moment. He is absolutely captivating every time he's on film and every time you begin to think you understand his motivations, you're wrong. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is excellent in her role. She in a tough position as the protagonist and needs to carry herself against the dominating presence of Goodman. She is capable and adapts well as her situation changes.John Gallagher Jr. is just plain likable. He's a good foil for the other actors and it's a chance for him to expand his name recognition.As for the film itself, I'm going to be deliberately vague as I don't want to spoil anything. The movie keeps the tension level up without fail and the minutes fly by. I recommend trying to know as little as possible before going in to seeing the film as the twists are a necessary part of the drama. Overall, the film is highly recommended. Just experience the tension, the fantastic acting and enjoy the ride.",8,4,6,10 March 2016
