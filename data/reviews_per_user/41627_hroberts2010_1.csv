Blade Runner 2049," Worthy of a second watch!!!
","A movie has to really capture something within me in order for me to take the time to see it more than once. I attempted to watch the original Blade Runner four times since it first came out in the 80's. Each time I fell asleep mostly due to the wonderful score. As a Sci-fi buff I was told I can't be a true Sci-fi fan until I actually sat through that movie. I bought the Blu-ray and made sure I was wide awake and undisturbed and a month ago in anticipation of this sequel, not only made it through but thoroughly enjoyed the film with an appreciation I don't think I would have held as a teen in the 80's. I saw Blade Runner 2049 and for me it captured the same essence of the original and was a wonderful continuity to the franchise. Now I feel there was something lost on a first watch that I can attribute to being distracted by commotion in the theater audience which I simply detest. If you are looking for an all out action film this is not for you and for the group of young men sitting near me, that was what they expected. An action thriller without so much story. It has plenty of action but the depth and emotion of the characters will be lost on you if you want to multitask and talk with others while the movie plays. For me I will wait for the Blu-ray and re-watch it in the peace of my home where I can reserve the right to send my family and pets out of the room if necessary! Definitely see it on the big screen, but if the full impact of this spectacular film and it's realistic imagined future has failed to leave you in wonder, you might want to consider a quieter re-watch as well.",9,19,45,18 October 2017
