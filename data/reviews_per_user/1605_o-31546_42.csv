The King's Speech," Brilliant performances by Colin Firth
","This is a biopic about how King George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II, overcame his stuttering problem. Widely considered by all but his father unfit to be king, George is reluctantly thrust unto the throne and into the spotlight after his brother is forced to abdicate. Overshadowed on the global stage by powerful orators like Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the King relies on the help of a little-known Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue to find his voice and courageously lead his people into the most devastating war humanity has ever faced.Above this chaos, confusion, and unrest, rises a weak shell of a man to greatness. Colin Firth is the vessel for that transformation and if he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance it will tarnish the Academy forever in my humble opinion. This is the kind of performance, and film overall, that you leave thinking to yourself that you've just seen the greatest movie ever. I loved every frame of it and every second of it was pure agony. Firth managed to portray the whole scale of King George's emotions and all whilst showing us the true nature of the man's problem. ---Yidioo",9,1,1,22 June 2017

The Sound of Music," The power of music, the joy of music
","The Sound of Music, the sound of freedom.This classic film is filled with glorious songs and has plenty for hopeless romantics to enjoy. The Sound of Music also effectively works in the tension and foreboding of the time period. Everyone in Austria has to make a choice when the Nazis arrive. Even the nuns in the abbey must make a choice.It's worth discussing with older kids why this was such a tense time and why the Von Trapps made the painful decision to flee the country they loved. It is a movie of catching freedom.'The Sound of Music' has contributed to the legend which has grown around the true life story of the Trapp family. ------Yidioo",9,12,12,20 June 2017
Zootopia," A funny, entertaining, heartfelt, and immersive movie with great characters
","'Zootopia' is the best animated movie of the year 2016 because the animation was terrific,the acting was mesmerizing and the plot was impressively perfect.A cute and smart rabbit Judy Hopps is so ambitious and intelligent.She wants to become a police officer. No bunnies ever before became police officers in the animal world of Zootopia because they are not strong enough. But Judy doesn't care what other people and animals think about her . She wants to overcome the prejudice and bigotry that a rabbit is small and weak animal and thus is not fit to become a police officer.She's determined to make her dream come true, but unfortunately for her,she faces problems. She caught a convicted Fox who has already committed a crime, and gave him the option that she can help him to avoid jail imprisonment if only he can definitely help her in finding the missing animals. As a result, the fox and the bunny become friends and because of the intelligence of the amazing Judy (the bunny) she cleverly tamed the sly fox and attracted him to do the good and to refrain from doing evil especially after he fell in love with this yummy bunny Judy.Zootopia is best of the best for the spectacular cinematography,impressive story,enchanting music and stunning acting. ---Yidioo",10,8,12,22 June 2017
The Mummy," The Mummy in 1999
","Recently, The new movie of Tom Cruise -- The Mummy (2017) has shown in cinema. As the new start of the old series, it brings limited feeling of freshness, compared with The Mummy (1999). When I was a child, The Mummy (1999) became a nightmare of me. After watching the new movie of Tom Cruise, I really think the old one is much better than the new one. This film is very predictable in the manner in which it is carried out. The formula of hero saves the girl, hero kills the villain, and hero saves the planet is tired and old, but it will be the addition of humor, special effects, and Fraser as a brilliant action hero that will carry this movie for most viewers.

Brokeback Mountain," Faultless in its sheer power and emotion
","An important and original romance that really and finally portrays the homosexual romance as two humans falling in love and never plays it for clichés.The movie occasionally drags, but in the end it is a powerful film featuring excellent acting and excellent writing. It is griping and also quite devastating. The drama is intense, and the emotions are raw.If you have the patience to sit through a slow-moving romance and you lack the vanity to be put off by explicit cowboy on cowboy relations, you'll greatly appreciate the light at the end of Brokeback Mountain, a work of art that's more than just a movie.A superb romantic drama featuring solid performances, especially from Ledger, and excellent direction from Lee. The complexity of the relationships between various characters, including both physical and emotional, is one of the movie's strengths and also featuring some beautiful and fitting music. ---Yidioo",8,1,2,25 June 2017
About Time," May be the best time travel concept I have seen
","Young love provides the framework for About Time, the latest movie from writer-director Richard Curtis. But the heart of the film is a story about a boy, his father and the greatest gift they can give each other: their time.I have seen many time travel concepts before but this is where my heart pounded better than any where.Not only romances is magnificent, humor and drama are also far better than many Classics. With Heart touching soundtracks and songs, the movie has Eye pleasing Scenes.Characters are perfectly casted. Performance, screenplay, dialogues etc all are first class. But the best is the Presentation of emotions which could be linked to every single person who ever Loved someone or just believes in.The movie begins with casual entries and remains a good entertainer till second half while in the last quarter(ending) it cross a bridge and steps in best movie category platform with a message of living.I strongly recommend this movie to all the viewers. ---Yidioo",9,1,1,21 June 2017
Moana," Beautiful in every sense, Moana will soften even the hardest of hearts
","Moana is not the most original Disney movie. It's not a wildly different experience like Zootopia, and it's not as subversive to the Disney tropes as Frozen was. It has a lot of the same tropes you see in any Disney movie, and in a lot of ways it's one of the most pure Disney movies, tropes and all, that's come out in a while. It doesn't have a romance which is definitely a refreshing take, but other than that we've definitely seen a lot of this before. But here's the thing, even though it's full of tropes, they're all tropes I love, and it's able to use these tropes in an original environment with characters I really loved.And Moana was a fun animation that set us out on adventures! It brought forth excitement with her never give up attitude. The computer aided animation was great. It is a wonderful children's animation. Good music, great story, and great adventure. It brought life to the Hawaiian mythology and gave me a subject to learn about. Making for another successful animated film by Disney. ----From Yidioo",7,0,2,29 June 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Simply, the Spider-man movie we deserve
","This is Spider-Man that we grow up with, his essence , sense of humour and behaviour but with all new gadget. This version of vulture is amazing, fully developed villain, he is very cruel dangerous and truly sinister.Great plot, the movie has many surprises. A movie worth going to the cinema another two times to watch it again. Best Spider-man to date congratulations to Marvel Studios for making this iconic character fantastic again now Marvel Studios need to open up the bank and bring this character home to keep it on the path of greatness. ---From Yidioo",9,28,51,9 July 2017
Life of Pi," An Ang Lee's movie:Life of pi
","Mr. Lee's film is stronger as a visual experience-especially in 3-D-than an emotional one, but it has a final plot twist that may also change what you thought you knew about the ancient art of storytelling.The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all together. The story sorta drags in the beginning, but Ang Lee did a good job keeping my attention to the film. When this movie came out, it was lauded for its amazing special effects in creating a life-like CGI tiger. Unfortunately, it seems people were too hyped about the visual effects, and ignored what is, in my opinion, the greatest story ever told. It is the story of Pi, and the 227 days he spent stranded out at sea after the ship he was on sunk. More importantly, though, it's a story of faith, proof, perception, reality, the darkness of man, and religion. I enjoyed the film, and you will too. ---Yidioo",9,0,1,21 June 2017
Doctor Strange," A fantastic, excellent and glamorous movie with everything
","The story about how Stephen Strange became Doctor Strange, the greatest sorcerer in the Marvel Universe and another Avenger, according to Stan Lee's material. His introduction to the MCU is an excellent combination of colors and visual effects, worthy of an Academy Award Nomination as it actually was.Great story! Great acting! Excellently directed. The CGI was believable for what it is. Great comedic relief throughout as usual. Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect for this role. The movie was visually stunning and whilst one particular part others may feel is too long - I felt the movie was well balanced.Filled with surprising corners and revealing secrets. The graphics are above phenomenal and the story is very fascinating as Dr. Strange figures out who he is and how he contains his mysterious and power within himself. One of the best marvel movies by far. Its special effects were great and so was the plot line. ---Yidioo",9,1,1,2 July 2017
Captain America: The First Avenger," I could do this all day --- Captain America
","Captain America is a superhero due to a super serum, but he looks cool, has cool moves, making America great again, and safe again. Chris Evans shines in the role and you are rooting for him throughout both before and after his transformation. Tommy lee is great, Chris Evans suits Steve Rogers an the clever shrinking of him was believable in places. The ending had a great setup for the avengers.Chris Evans was great as Captain America. He nailed the character. After watching him as Captain America, I can't see anyone else in the role. The special effects performed on him to make him look skinny for the first part of the movie were absolutely seamless. If I hadn't known about them, I wouldn't have been able to tell they were there. But those effects would not have looked nearly so great if it had not been for Evans convincingly 'acting skinny'. No matter what condition Steve Rogers is in, shrimp or super soldier, Chris Evans portrayed him flawlessly.Before he became strong, his bully yelling 'Had Enough?!' Steven stands up, holding a garbage can like a shield and says 'I could do this all day.' 'I could do this all day' becomes a spirit of Captain America and encourage him never give up. ---Yidioo",8,1,1,27 June 2017
Léon: The Professional," Leon: The Professional：what does meet the eye is pretty and exciting
","With a very interesting, yet simple premise, 'Leon: The Professional' is a very smart, stylistic thriller about a young girl whose family has been murdered. Trying to cope with that while being on the run by a hit-man who is saving her life, the bonding between the two is unlike anything you will get in most films out there, from any generation. From it's extremely drab look, to the creepy vibe Leon gives, even though you know his intentions are great, this is one film you surely shouldn't miss. In the end, this is one of the best films in this genre that I have ever seen. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are phenomenal, the script is undeniably brilliant, and the score will have your heart racing, even in moments you would least expect.I highly recommend this film to fans and non-fans of this genre. 'Leon: The Professional' is a brilliant picture.Leon: The Professional is a wonderful character study, enriched by outstanding performances, thrilling action, and a well-rounded script that gives the film an intriguing amount of depth.Luc Besson's original feels more like a journey than just a joy-buzzer jolt of action, and the deeper, braver, darker story he set out to tell - a fractured and fractious fairy tale. When people rave about 'The Professional,' they mean 'Léon.'I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. Besson's skill with action is inventive and creative (and of course over the top). ---Yidioo",9,3,3,21 June 2017
Baby Driver," A blast of pure pop energy
","Baby Driver is an absolutely brilliant film from Edgar Wright. The performances in this film are all top notch. There are a lot of twists and turns that worked perfectly. I cared about the plot and was invested in the story. The car chase scenes were amazing. They were all in tune with the soundtrack, which was really fun to watch. While the film isn't a full on comedy, it provides some great laughs. The soundtrack felt like its own character. The music fits perfectly and fit very well with the story. From the directing, acting, the soundtrack, and everything in between, the film is a unique and one of a kind experience that cannot be missed.It's a fun genre mashup that's also rather disposable, offering quick surges of pleasure akin to the cavalcade of tasty pop, rock and R&B songs that litter the soundtrack and provide the film's heartbeat. Action lovers will be impressed by the film's choreography and live stunts, one driver entering and exiting a narrow alley with 180 degree spins. ---Yidioo",8,12,21,2 July 2017
The Revenant," Leonardo DiCaprio really did deserve all the awards that he got for this role
",The Revenant is a gorgeous film about a few mens' experiences in northern mid- America in the early 1800s westward expansion era. It was expertly directed. The use of natural light really adds to the danger of the environment that surrounds Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio). Innaritu loves the camera to pan around objects and people to create a sense of awe and spectacle.I thought it was his best film by far. The realism and intensity of his performance really comes through. The story was gripping throughout the whole film and I found the twists and turns very interesting. ---Yidioo,9,1,1,9 July 2017
"I, Robot"," amazing performance from will smith and shia lebouf
","I enjoyed it and thats all that matters. Some scenes were a little ridiculous. I, Robot provides a fun mystery with a few predictable, but interesting, turns. The mystery aspect is clever enough to keep you guessing without frustrating you to the point of taking you out of the movie. You'll care about it right up until the point you realize that the movie is actually a summer blockbuster and your thinking cap should be put on the backburner while you're bombarded with one action scene after the next. ---From Yidioo",7,0,2,6 July 2017
Now You See Me," One of the most underrated movies around
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I honestly did not figure it out, and that is rare for me. Four magicians/illusionists basically team up to become Robin Hood - stealing from the rich and unworthy and giving to the poor and bamboozled.Now You See Me offer a magical adventure for the audience to be taken on as four magicians are brought together to conduct some amazing feats of magic while the FBI are hot on their tails. With a brilliant cast, lovable characters, a great plot not to mention a few unlikely twists along the way, this is a film definitely worth watching.This film is fun and entertaining. Everyone thinks they're a critic. They think some magic can't happen in the real ,while the movie uses special effect to make it happen. But in my view, can't copy these magics in the real doesn't make sense. Most movies may exaggerated to make unreal scenes and that's the charm of movies for the reason that most movies are imaginary.Great cast, twisty plot and just plain fun. Relax and enjoy the ride. ---Yidioo",8,0,0,27 June 2017
Captain America: Civil War," This is my favourite MCU movie
","Political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the Avengers lead to collateral damage. The new status quo deeply divides the members of the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes superheroes should remain free to defend humanity without government interference. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sharply disagrees and supports oversight. As the debate escalates into an all-out feud, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Falcon (Sam Wilson) must pick a side.This movie is able to push so many characters together into one story. There are so many characters but it still manages to keep a Captain America story. There's a great balance of humor, action and drama! One of the best superhero movie of all time. Loved the movie, all characters were awesome specially Spidey he killed it in that movie and the same thing with Black Panther. Best fights ever! The airport battle was epic and the fight we all been waiting for: Cap vs Iron man.",10,1,5,3 July 2017

Big Hero 6," A considerate friend called Baymax
","Big Hero 6 offers something for everyone: action, camaraderie, superheroes and villains. But mostly, Baymax offers a compassionate and healing voice for those suffering, and a hug that can be felt through the screen.Big Hero 6 is a beautiful film, showcasing how much animation has become. The east and west coast mash up of San Fransokyo combines to make such a spectacular scenery, that the city may as well be a character to the film.The cast is also fun to watch. The cast is truly dramatic, whether you are precise like Wasabi, positive like Honey Lemon or just a guy who loves media like Fred. It still be a great Disney movie of all time. I don't care what the critic reviews say this movie is a true masterpiece. Showing that no matter what happens in your life you need to do whats right. Also introducing the most lovable character in movie history. The basis for the movie is so unique compared to most other Disney movies.To be honest, when I saw the preview I thought it was going to be another Disney movie gone bad.But I was smiling right from the beginning and found myself a little teary-eyed towards the end. So I do recommend this movie if you're up for a nice light movie with a lot of laughs: it might be better than you think. ------Yidioo.com",9,1,2,22 June 2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Adults and kids alike will take macabre delight in the punishment of naughty children
","Charlie nails both the themes and spirit of the original story in a way that the previous version simply didn't manage. The book is, at its heart, a warning about materialistic excess and greed, using the Western world's slavering desire to consume chocolate as a cautionary tale of how modern society makes us lose sight of the most important things in life.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a very respectable film that does have its issues such as the lack of a darker tone and a mostly very annoying soundtrack, but the characterization and storytelling are both excellent here, the flashback structure is well handled, the humor is great and the visual effects are expectedly terrific. May be someone like it, while other one don't. Hope you can enjoy this movie. ---Yidioo",7,3,4,22 June 2017
The Dark Knight," One of the greatest superhero movies of all time
","Recently, we could watch Batman in cinema again(Batman v Superman). But today I want to review another movie about Batman:the dark knight. This is truly an all star cast spearheaded by Heath Ledger as the Joker, who gives a phenomenal performance.This film is just phenomenal. It's hard to put into words just how good it is. As with seemingly every Christopher Nolan-directed film, it makes you think and you'll probably have to watch it more than once to truly understand everything in the film. What really made this film, however, is just how real it felt. Most superhero movies are pretty cliché, but this movie didn't even feel like a superhero movie. It felt like it could actually happen in real life. It was more like a crime drama film that just happened to include Batman. ---Yidioo",9,0,1,10 July 2017
La La Land," A stunning film with incredible cinematography, acting, and music
","La La Land is a musical masterpiece! It has everything you want in a movie its got terrific performances, excellent music, beautiful scenery, and a great story. For all you jazz and/or musicals fans out their I highly recommend La La Land for you.The premise of the story is that Stone is a young actress who has moved to LA to wait tables while auditioning to try and 'make it', while Gosling is a jazz purist ('Anyone who doesn't like jazz just doesn't have the right...context', he insists) who plays the piano in bars to make a living and dreams of opening his own Jazz bar. Or to put it succinctly - 'Two young artists meet and fall in love while chasing their dreams'. The musical flows thematically from first love to heartbreak and every other emotion between, with great music throughout.This film defies genre. It is a masterpiece. I urge you to see it. ---Yidioo",7,1,3,28 June 2017
The Legend of 1900," 1900: He is a legend
","At the very start, when I saw the name of this movie, I thought '1900' as a particular year. Then I realized it also refers to a name.That is because as a squawling infant he was discovered on the luxury liner Virginian by a man named Boodmann the year 1900. He is reared in the engine room, his cradle swaying as the ship rolls, and as an adult plays piano in the ship's lounge.It's cinematography, superb acting and beautifully scripted storyline, its an intelligent film that leaves you spellbound.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Hilarious movie and a great meaning to family
","As a huge fan of the first film, I went to watch the movie as soon as it came out. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie's long duration.The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It's simply one of these movies that are always fun to watch.The story was solid and a good follow-up to the first, and the emotionally packed third act never failed to bring tears to my eyes. It's very relatable and sets up the amazing continuation in the Infinity Wars. Even better than first one. --- Yidioo.com",9,2,6,27 June 2017

The Departed," I like this film, but I certainly don't love it
","'Infernal Affairs' is one of the most successful films in Asia, and it became internationally known when Martin Scorsese adapted it to shoot 'The Departed'.This is a very good movie - I loved the parallel stories of the undercover cop (DiCaprio) and the bent cop (Damon.) Listening to their Bostonian accents made me think they'd be perfect as the Kennedy brothers - they certainly look the part, especially Damon. So many great performers here - including Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga - and of course, whenever Jack Nicholson is on screen he just wipes everyone else out by sheer force of charisma. He's not only a great actor, but one of the few true stars still with us. But the Chinese one still a better version than the Departed.What the remake did wrong was making the girlfriends of our protagonists into the same person, adding a love triangle, which was unnecessary and distracting. ---From Yidioo",6,2,2,6 July 2017

One of the greatest musician stories around, portrayed beautifully by such talented acting from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Left me wanting more, and definitely had some twists and turns that I didn't expect, which was really nice. I cannot find a major flaw with this movie. Granted, there isn't really such thing as a flawless movie but I cannot find a major flaw that takes you out of the viewing experience. The music is excellent. I mean the acting is spectacular.

Sherlock Holmes," Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law make a great team!
","When a string of brutal murders terrorizes London, it doesn't take long for legendary detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his crime- solving partner, Dr. Watson (Jude Law), to find the killer, Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). A devotee of the dark arts, Blackwood has a bigger scheme in mind, and his execution plays right into his plans. The game is afoot when Blackwood seems to rise from the grave, plunging Holmes and Watson into the world of the occult and strange technologies.Extremely entertaining reinterpretation of Sherlock Holmes; characters made believable and likable by Robert Downey, Jr and Jude Law. And the music by Hans Zimmer fit perfect to the fast action scenes in old world London. The two have fantastic buddy chemistry, and their good-natured bickering is a delight. Parents should be aware that this PG-13 film, while very light on offensive language and sexuality (a woman's bare back is seen, as is a man's bare chest in a different scene, and there is one innuendo) does have a good deal of action violence and some blood. Also, the storyline involves the occult, which is displayed as evil and to be combated, but its portrayal may still make some uncomfortable. Sherlock Holmes comes recommended to those who enjoy action films with substance. ---From Yidioo",8,1,1,6 July 2017
Finding Dory," Excellent for kids
","Finding Dory had the potential to be annoying, and for a certain amount of time, it feels almost laborious due to Dory's memory loss being played for effect numerous times before her long term memory kicks into gear. Once it does, the movie takes off. Dory pulls Marlin and Nemo along with her to meet another batch of interesting and funny sea creatures, as she learns where she came from, how she got lost, and where her parents got off to. It's a terrific kids movie, and has enough emotional depth to stay interesting for the adults, especially those who were kids when Finding Nemo was out in 2003, and felt the fear and apprehension of Marlin as he and Dory hunted for his lost son.There will probably not be another one of these movies, but that's fine. The story is superb, the characters are diverse and fun, and there's plenty of bright colors and beautiful visuals to go around. It's heart is, undeniably, in the right place, with new, amazing side characters that has become expected from Pixar. It just never achieves the highest emotional impact on me, like I felt many previous Pixar films have had. Pixar is great at making animated movies that have more to them than just simple kids stuff, and they've proved that over and over. It's no accident that this movie is the highest grossing animated film of all time. ---From Yidioo",8,2,3,29 June 2017
Arrival," A film that not only tests the idea of aliens, but of humanity
","Best science fiction film of the year against tough competition. Excellent intelligent science fiction with linguists attempting to decipher an alien language at first contact. The world seems headed for war with distrust of the aliens and each other when our hero realizes the aliens have traveled in time. Great acting and great plot. Visually the film is fantastic with an expert play on light and dark imagery, and the very deliberate use of color to emphasize certain characters and events. This transfers into the shadowy and smoke filled environment inside the alien vessel as well as the ink like Rorschach style alien writing. While trying to discover what the Aliens are, and their motivation, Dr. Louise Banks discovers what makes herself human and questions everything held sacred to her. 'Arrival' is just as much a film about aliens landing on earth, as a film about self- discovery and the value placed on love and loss.Worth watching. Some terrific emotional performances which is rare for science fiction films. ---Yidioo",8,4,10,29 June 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Birdman is incredibly clever character study and a modern classic
","Birdman is the kind of film I can watch again and again, with each viewing lending a new appreciation for some small detail; a camera angle, a seemingly throwaway line, a drum beat.This film was not what I thought it would be, but I was not disappointed. Birdman has everything that most modern movies lack; wit, integrity, originality and realism. This is a beautifully directed film by Alejandro and the script is so good and the chacters so interesting that talking scenes are just as investing and exciting as any action sequence. The performances in this film are great too, Michael Keaton, Edward Norton, Emma Stone and the rest of the cast all give intriguing performances that perfectly suit their characters. ---From Yidioo",8,0,1,9 July 2017
Wonder Woman," My feeling after watching Wonder Woman
","Wonder Woman deserve any praise. The script is wonderful and it give me a surprise: I thought the boss was Ludendorff but he is dead too early. And the god of war--Ares whom I thought is a symbol(do not exist). Then I found I was wrong again.The movie is 'patient'. We get the chance to see in depth Diana's motives and why she 'walked away from mankind' 100 years ago, and why she returned to protect this world forever.Beautiful landscapes in Themiscyra, a great first act. Then, after Diana leaves her home, we get to see her adjusting in the outside world, and realizing what this war is really about.Every action scene, especially those with her theme song in the background and the combination of darkness and humor are absolutely fascinating.I liked every performance, but Gal Gadot was the best by far, portraying Diana exceptionally. Gal Gadot is a wonderful and unique actor for Wonder Woman. She is too beautiful and perfect. I like her and this movie very much. ---Yidioo",10,13,29,25 June 2017
Iron Man," I am a big fan of him
","It Still highly watchable today.Iron Man hits every note for a superhero movie. Robert Downey was born to play Tony Stark, as he revels in playing a funny, witty, often arrogant, yet likable playboy. The writing and acting is solid, with every actor playing roles that seem meant for them. Easily one of the best films from Marvel Studios.Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. ---Yidioo",10,1,1,25 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A very deep, emotional, and at times complex film
","Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition: If your looking for a quick, cheap thrill then you might not enjoy this film at the time. This movies theatrical version was butchered by WB and in doing so reshaped the story leaving numerous plot holes. So the Ultimate Edition is the full story and the one worth seeing. Watch 'Man of Steel' before seeing this movie. There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time.This film is about Superman trying to become Superman. Trying to help the world, save people, find a place in this world not as an outcast, and yet is looked at has a threat by many. Superman is not from this world, yet He is trying to be human, find a place in this world, be excepted by earths people, and come into his destiny.This film is also about Batman being Batman for 20 years and losing faith in humanity, and fearing Superman, what Superman can do with his powers. Great film, great plot, great visuals. ---Yidioo",8,76,109,25 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great addition to the Star Wars legacy!
","Star Wars is back and in the best way possible! The new and the old cast are amazing ! I loved every second of it! One of my personal favorite movies of all time! I am very excited for the future of Star Wars.Such a phenomenal movie! The Force Awakens is definitely on my top ten.The force is very strong with this one!They needed to introduce the series. I thought they did a wonderful job with the cast and the effects and the acting was really good. Can't wait to see what they have for episode eight! A great movie with a lot of great surprises! Great acting! Great story! been a huge fan of the Star Wars movies since 1984. Watched them gazillions of times of the years. I never noticed The Force Awakens being a remake of A New Hope. The whole plot is the mystery of Luke Skywalker!!! The people who are complaining are just looking for something to complain about, look cool and be an attention hoar. Star Wars The Force Awakens was wonderful. ---Yidioo",7,44,73,4 July 2017
Deadpool," Good movie but it is not suit for children
","Incredibly funny and irreverent! There is no superhero movie like this one and it really breaks the standards. It was a fun violent R-rated comedy.I have been waiting for a Deadpool movie ever since I heard of the character. He's a brilliant, funny, self-referential, pop-culture-spewing enigma. This is why I thought getting a Deadpool movie franchise started would be difficult. To faithfully represent the character, surely the fact that his origins are hazy, to say the least, should be touched upon? But, I suppose, coming up with a definitive origin story was a must, so I can forgive that. Everything else about the movie is as good as I thought it would be. Funny, irreverent, with a good dose of fighting and explosions. ---Yidioo",8,1,2,4 July 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," my feeling after watching hacksaw ridge
","Hacksaw Ridge is a 2016 biographical war drama film about the World War II experiences of Desmond Doss who was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian, refusing to carry or use a firearm or weapons of any kind. Doss became the first conscientious objector to be awarded the Medal of Honor, for service above and beyond the call of duty during the Battle of Okinawa.There are many hidden description of the vicious Japanese. Desmond Doss climbed with the troops to the top of the Hacksaw Ridge. All they can saw was the smoke everywhere with much body on the ground. They even could hear their breath sounds. The build of tense atmosphere here is very good. Suddenly someone was killed then I found the degree of tragic more than I imagined before. There are many soldiers were killed by Japanese and also a lot of soldiers were wounded. Desmond Doss tried his best to save people and he never give up. After a whole day, the US military was beaten back by suicide attack but Desmond Doss lost his time to retreat because of saving people.In the next night, the US military found that many wounded on the top was hanging down one by one. That's what Desmond Doss did. No matter how he got tired, he still never give up. He just said: Let's me save one more. And when he saved more than one, he just repeated of these words: One more.You can see it on HTTP://www.yidioo.com/ for free. No one thought he could survive after the war. But He became the most dazzling light in the team, greatly encouraged the morale.",9,6,9,15 June 2017
Furious 7," A movie stands emotionally surrounding around Paul walker
","I think the 5th part Fast Five is the best, I have watched all the parts & today I watched its latest movie & its action is good but story is weak. Maybe the going away of Paul obstruct the scenario of the movie. But it really looks like a medley scenario.All in all, as the fan of Paul, it worths for watching.---From Yidioo",8,0,1,21 June 2017
