The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," w-veronica
","I'm not really sure whether the subject effected me or not. I think it was more the music, Irene Jacob and just two scenes that really effected me. Musics were amazing. It has been 2 hours I finished watching the movie but the concert seen is still open. I listened and watched it several times. I think Irene Jacob played her best. The seen of crossing of two girls' life was impressive and the way Veronique becomes aware of her twin by seeing the picture made the last shock in the movie. I think director was successful in the sense that during the movie you'r always expecting something to happen by not too much things happen.The naked scenes of Irene Jacob was really aesthetic but it looks like director has used her beauty too much.. The worst part of the movie was its end. I don't know what it should finish like but i know it shouldn't finish like that. Gozen",7,3,8,18 October 2006
