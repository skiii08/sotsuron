Lucky Number Slevin," I wish this was more popular
","I could care less about the cast, whether they are A List celebrities or not it doesn't matter. A movie can be great without a star packed cast. But these are people who have been around the Hollywood block and Sir Ben Kingsly sure knows how to play a great role. This is my favorite movie of all time, are there better ones out there as far as cinematic value and legendary statuses? Sure, but I can't explain why this had me at the edge of my seat. How the guy who annoys everyone by guessing the big twist at the end of any movie, and being right all the time, can't figure this one out. They didn't make it obvious but they didn't hide it all too well. I guess I was immersed in the story to much to pay attention.Either way this movie just hit me right on the head with enjoyment. It has its small bits of action which I loved. I don't need an explosion every 5 minutes to keep my attention and I hate it when everything ends in gunfire and crappy one liners. It has suspenseful moments that truly make you giddy with anticipation. It has its drama which will require more empathy if you can provide such immersion when watching movies.But what it does best is its twist ending. It's not all in your face like M Night Shamalyn.... Shamamalyeen I don't know the guy that did Six Sense. Ohhhh he's an amazing director for that movie and deserves more respect, no thanks not from me. I paid... ahem sorry WASTED 15 bucks too see The Village in theaters and if you saw that movie you'll know why I hate him. And Avatar the Last Airbender. Either way this twist is slick with it's entrance and it fits so right with the movie. Every thing about this movie is absolutely awesome in my mind. And of course it has its humor, which Josh does an excellent job with.Yes this isn't a review, this is just a fan expressing his love for his favorite movie and I am completely bias when it comes to its overall performance. Considering I'm not too easy to please when it comes to movies I would say then, maybe it will be your favorite too.",10,0,1,27 August 2013
Suicide Squad," As a fan of 1987 Suicide Squad comics I was pleased
","First off, this can't be looked at in comparison to The Dark Knight because these are two very different stories in the Gotham Universe. People going into this with that mindset might be disappointed. I know this was more based off the 2011 Suicide Squad comics which I don't mind. I found it odd Deadshot got the spotlight as more of a 'main character' type. It was something I could dislike easily because she's usually quiet and menacing in the background. Will Smith ended up playing a great Deadshot. As much as I love Harley, Joker steals the show. I love the classic cartoon Joker and he played it brilliantly.There's some good character development and the writing was more funny than I expected but DC is just so dark all the time I felt like it enhanced it. It's funny but in a dark twisted way in the comics. If I had to say some negatives... I don't like the shaky-cam action fight that are way too zoomed in to see anything. It was tolerable and there were some great action movie moments. However because they had character development, it allows the audience to care more about the fights/action. You can have a good character piece with bad action cause at least you care about what's going on. Bad writing or bad character presentation with great action will not get the crowd to have a reaction. But I wouldn't go as far as calling it bad. However the editing was terrible. I heard they took this movie into a focus group who knew nothing about movies or proper story structure for that matter and let them dictate what happened to it. David Ayer did a great job, don't ruin his work through editing. I'm reviewing this based off what I saw in his original idea. The movie would get a 9 if they didn't change it.I can't really judge it on a typical movie goer scale because I go to see the comic book movies for a reason. When they get it right, it's gold. I don't mind a few changes if they positively affect the overall outcome. This movie succeeded with that. I'd highly recommend to comic fans.",8,55,104,5 August 2016
The Village," Bad M Night Shyamalan Bad!
","(I'll warn you before I talk about the ending)I know people like this movie, I know that in the grand scheme of things it could be a good movie. But it isn't... let me count the ways; stale, boring, lifeless characters under the genre Horror to NOT have any horror and a cheesy down right stupid twist ending make this movie not only pointless but terrible. You could argue that no one saw that coming, sure and you'd be right. The reason why people couldn't see that ending coming? Cause its out of place and stupid. I know he is a good director and a good writer but this has to be him laziest work ever. (I take that back because he has out done himself with Happening and Last Airbender) It doesn't help that there are no scary moments and the actors are dreadfully boring.Not a single scary thing happened during this entire movie. It's now labelled suspense but the trailers during its release made it look like a horror movie. Which is why I saw it. I like horror movies and this wasn't horror. Two cheap jumpscares that wouldn't scare my mom, extremely dumb monsters that you only see a few times and they never built the horror up to be suspenseful or have any tension/atmosphere. This movie failed in every aspect.!!::WARNING SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH::!! Okay... so they are going to create their own perfect village away from crime and blah blah blah. If the story is set in the present time why the hell did they go and make their village ye-olde times? Wouldn't a nuclear war that killed every part of the world except for their village be better? Or a virus swept across the world and they were immune? You could wear normal clothes and have normal tools just don't bring any cell phones or computers to the village. Anyone who isn't an elder doesn't know a damn thing, kids only know the world they live in by what they are told from parents.... if the kid doesn't find out on their own. You don't even mention phones to them and they will never know that technology existed. Or hell pretend your Omish at least, that way you can have the helpful tools for crops and farming but no technology for them to ever find out what happened. Going outside the village? Anything would of been better than dumb people in costumes! Tell them there isn't anything out there but barren wastelands and dangerous mutated animals. Poison gas, radiation or the scariest thing of all... people. Tell them there are groups of dangerous murdering psychos who all have their own villages or something. Anything would have been better than 'we live in ye-olde times' cause there a tons of things that could ruin their cover up.I'm not writer I'm just a movie go-er but I was not at all shocked or scared by this movie. I'm sorry I know people say there are some really amazing cinematic skills in this movie but I can't get past how stupid it all is.",1,0,4,28 August 2013
Saving Private Ryan," The only movie my grandfather couldn't finish
","My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable 'I can't watch this' reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why.",10,96,102,11 October 2018
Ghost Rider," I'm ashamed to call myself a Ghost Rider fan...
","The fear I have whenever I say 'I'm a fan of Ghost Rider' stems from the thought that people who do not know the comics will think I'm a fan of these movies. This is one of the worst comic book movies of all time. Captain America with Reb Brown? No, bad but fun to watch. The Captain America movie from 1990? Close but... not the worst. The original Avengers movie from 1998? Easily 2nd place. No this Ghost Rider movie takes that title. Because we didn't expect those other movies to be any good. Ghost Rider on the other hand had every chance to be a good a movie. It's not hard to make a good Ghost Rider movie, your character is a flaming skull... that should be instant awesome but no this movie goes out of it's way to spit on the fans.Before I tear this movie a new ***hole let me say what I like about it. The visuals were about the greatest part of the movie. They did capture Ghost Rider comics very well, because the concept art, props, characters and settings all came from the only department with people who actually work on comic books. Everyone else were a bunch of Hollywood snobs. So the Rider's bike, the Ghost Rider himself, the Phantom Rider (the original Ghost Rider that looked like a cowboy) and his demonic horse were all visually amazing.That's it, even when they have something awesome they make sure to destroy it as fast as possible. I'll sum up the entire movie in one scene: The Ghost Rider and the Phantom Rider are about to head off to the final confrontation. The Phantom Rider says he's coming with Johnny Blaze and they take off together making one of the most visually awesome build ups to an ending. The Phantom Rider... A flaming skull under a cowboy hat riding atop a flaming demonic horse riding next to The Ghost Rider on his flaming demonic motorcycle. The level of awesome this is cannot be described... and what happens? Right before the battle they stop and the Phantom Rider says he can't go any further then just leaves?! That was his last transformation really? He couldn't wait till they got there then transform so he could actually help in the fight. They tease you into thinking a demonic cowboy with his signature flaming whip and hellfire revolver is going to team up with a demonic biker with his flaming chain... but no that scene would be too good for this movie. It would actually make the movie awesome, so they didn't want to do that. He just rides there and ****s off.There's Ghost Rider in a nutshell. Visually building you up and then completely ruining it with stupidity. A massive disappointment, and I didn't even go into the fact that they completely destroyed the comic book lore and re-writing everything to fit their stupidity. If you say 'Well the Phantom Rider only had a little more juice and he just wanted to ride there, they travel faster when they're transformed so if he didn't it would take forever' No no... no. Ghost Rider doesn't have juice, he's a demonic being under the control of the devil who breaks his control and thus serves under the body he is in, Johnny Blaze. There is no juice, power level, it's not a super power the Ghost Rider is a being. So the Ghost Rider can't be in two bodies at once, but I was willing to let that major screw up slide had they joined the two together in combat to team up. They did nothing, it was a trailer shot. You got tricked, they already had your money... screw you leave the movie early if you want we already got paid. And that is EXACTLY what they did, the proof is in the trailer for Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance. They trick you into thinking it's going to be a good movie leave you with nothing but pretty visuals.Ghost Rider 2 Spirit of Vengeance turns out to be worse. The Ghost Rider with blue fire is a COMPLETELY different person, Johnny Blaze isn't the Ghost Rider with blue fire. He's the next Ghost Rider after Johnny Blaze and his name is Daniel. And they had a character named Danny to trick you even more. Spirit of Vengeance isn't the Ghost Rider either he's a villain in the comics. But according to the movie's story Johnny Blaze is still the Ghost Rider only now the Ghost Rider has blue fire cause he's the Spirit of Vengeance? That's like saying Superman is Lex Luthor, that's like taking The Joker and revealing it's been Batman all along! It's BULL**** They knew they were tricking you into thinking it was going to be a good movie, they knew we all thought Nicholas Cage was being replaced with a new Ghost Rider. I'm going to do the Rider justice and burn this decrepit movie and pee on it's ashes. Oh my god that reminded me Ghost Rider pees fire in the sequel.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I HATE THESE MOVIES!",1,0,1,3 April 2014
The Dark Knight," 9 out of 10? Really?!
","I'm sorry but I can't judge a movie based on one character. Had this movie featured Heath as the Joker for the main character and it was more of a background and story on him then yes 10 out of 10 for me. As a comic book fanatic I can't even begin to describe how happy I man to see a great representation of comic lore. Finally a character torn right out of the pages and put on the big screen. Too often than naught comic book movie are horrible, Hollywood is losing their creativity and they revert to nothing but remakes and comics. If your going to do it, DO IT RIGHT. The Joker isn't as his name seems, a comical villain with a nasty sense of humor. He is a murdering psychopath with a strange love of knives and bombs. Also he loves making people smile, mostly against their will. Heath did the best COMIC book Joker of all time. Sure Jack Nicholson did a great Joker as well, but he was doing the cartoon Joker.Okay enough of Heath Ledger's amazing performance, the rest of the movie just falls apart for me. Aside from Alfred and the Joker I don't see many characters I could understand. Fox was okay but his biggest problem with everything was hacking people's phones? He'll make tanks and weapons but hacking phones is not cool? Uhh that was just conflict for the sake of conflict. Christian Bale did an amazing Bruce Wayne, literally picture perfect but that's a small part of his personality. Batman doesn't have Laryngitis does he? He had a deep dark voice sure but it was still human. And the ending with its overtone of I'll be evil to be good was just stupid. The Dark Knight comic was easily the Batman's greatest moment in comic history and while I will say I enjoyed this comic book movie a million times more than the other sh*t I see.... *cough*GHOSTRIDER*cough* I will admit I loved watching it.But this movie has no right being called better than Citizen Kane or Goodfellas... or any of Stanley Kubrick's work. Again good movie just not legendary.",6,0,1,28 August 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Stuck in the middle for me
","I'm not giving a low rating because I'm against whats popular. Shawshank Redemption is a great film, its actually one my favorites. The characters are portrayed very well, except for Andy. I know he is supposed to be an emotionless socially awkward guy who only has one facial expression. In that case he played his role perfectly but I don't think its a wise choice to have a... main? Character like that? I'm not sure if Red was the main character, he is our eyes and ears so...Either way the film shows cinematic genius and truly amazing story telling. I enjoyed every second of it, some say certain areas of the story dragged on too long but hey its prison. Every moment in prison is dragged along. But I don't know about being the greatest film on IMDb. I would say Citizen Kane should be number 1. Citizen Kane is so amazing its actually art. So again loved Shawshank Redemption and I wish more movies were like it, but I don't know about greatest film of all time.",6,0,1,28 August 2013
Straight Outta Compton," An interesting story
","First off I want to point out the negative reviews I've seen, opinions are opinions but honestly if you are not a fan of hip-hop this really isn't the movie for you.I love hip-hop but I wasn't a massive fan of NWA. I knew their music but I preferred KRS-One, Tupac, Biggie and Rakim. Regardless, I had a lot of fun watching this movie. The beginning of the movie has some good humor and you see some important character development. The acting isn't something I'd praise though, however they wanted to cast people who looked as closely to the young NWA crew and in that regard they did very well.One thing that shocked me was the character Jerry (The NWA manager) and his character development. This isn't a spoiler he's well known to be shady when it comes to money. I was expecting him to be an evil mustache twirling villain but I was wrong. There's a scene where Jerry stood up against police officers that were harassing the young NWA crew outside their studio. He genuinely showed care for them as told the police officers they were a disgrace and they had no right to harass people by the color of their skin. They also showed African-American police officers being prejudice which was something you would see in the LA area at that time. So the movie wasn't anti-white people.The drama is played up well as you see these characters be put into difficult situations. They covered the NWA song F The Police while later in the movie they show the LA Riots and what anarchy looked like. It wasn't too preachy though, there were scenes that had me laughing a lot. They mixed the emotions up enough to show the good times they had which made their moments of struggle more effective.It's not a cinematic masterpiece by any means but I feel the movie was very entertaining and had some interesting moments as well. People say negative things regarding the party scenes, but haven't we seen movies with sex in them before? We're adults here right? Lastly, the comments regarding anti-sexism... there was a scene where they treated a woman poorly but it was inside a crackhouse. Later in the movie we see Dr. Dre with a nice respectable young woman who is treated like a proper girlfriend. They are not always degrading women in every scene.If you're a fan of hip-hop I would recommend it.",8,4,30,28 September 2015
Goodfellas," Cinematic genius
","Sure this is a gangster movie and in the genre of gangster movies this stands as one of the greatest of all time. But I think this movie holds that title even out of its genre. I think this is one of the greatest movies of all time. From realistic characters and some of the finest acting in movies, to an epic story full of humor/suspense/drama/tragedy, the colorful dialog that feels so organic you wouldn't be able to tell the actors are reciting lines from a script and the most amazing part of it all is the fact that this all actually happened. I can't help but feel more drawn into movies that are based off real events. Sure its a movie but its telling a real story that I haven't heard before, I don't know who lives and dies in this story and because these characters represent real people I can't help but think when someone dies in the movie its possible that person they are playing was actually killed in real life. And that makes me care about the characters in the movie so much more.This is an example of a gangster movie that doesn't need action to be a good a movie. There aren't crazy shoot outs and explosions going off every 5 minutes, its the mob. The real mob... the 'cut your throat in your sleep quietly' mob. Every aspect of the movie was done so well. The actors play their roles perfectly, the director shot this movie to make every scene an amazingly epic visual spectacle for the audience, the writer drenched every part of this story with realistic human emotion and Henry Hill got to tell his story through an amazing piece of cinema.Realism is by far this movies best aspect. The story is being told by Henry Hill and the movie portrayed the actual events from the actual point of view it was lived from. In this movie you won't know anything Henry Hill doesn't know. For example towards the end (not a spoiler don't worry) Henry Hill's wife was told to go into a shop and pick up a dress, she felt as if she was going to walk into a trap and get whacked. So she left in hurry, we aren't told whether she was actually going to get whacked... we aren't shown a piece of evidence other than there are people in that store and they stopped talking the second she walked up. We don't know if it was actually going to happen, because the real Henry Hill didn't know if it was actually going to happen. That is realism, that is a movie that stays true to the person's point of view.There are tons of those tiny little details like that in the movie. And while they maybe minor details to the story, they actually show the true cinematic genius that went into this absolutely amazing movie.",10,0,1,28 August 2013
