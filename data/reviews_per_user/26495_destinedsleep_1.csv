The Equalizer," we are magpies now?
","It is shiny. It has glitter. It had logic. It has Denzel appearing intelligent with reading 100 books. Its not what the opening leads you to believe. No, we are sucked in with 20 minutes of, we might have cool and suave mixed with some believable action. Fool me once... Instead I watch this highly trained, unbeatable assassin/hand to hand combat, best the CIA ever trained warrior, who from what the movie will have us believe, the who's who of who in society and military world over, would consider themselves privileged to get a decline to their respective RSPV's to their daughters wedding, blows up a ship, by remote control or timer, but is casually strolling away while shrapnel is penetrating shipping containers all around him! Not that strolling away while your explosives are about to probably kill you is dumb or anything...., cause he has great intuitiveness. Like with the whore. There are, lol, a few other moments I could waste my finger on, but why? If you defend this as a good film then you probably never knew why Pink Floyd were so great. And I cannot hold any credibility for something that holds so little taste for art. Getting back to our Denzel character.... if I didn't think this guy was a tool before, blowing up the shipping container so casually, he comes out of retirement for a white trash hooker! Some professional! Or maybe I got hookers wrong. Maybe Hollywood have an insight I have misconceived and most are really sweethearts who need to be nurtured into the butterflies they always were.... â–² Top",Null,0,0,2 May 2015
