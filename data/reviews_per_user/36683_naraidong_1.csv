The Avengers," Chemical mixture of triumph
","Putting the quote of Dr. Benner in an ironic manner, this movie simply stands out as this year's mega-hit with the perfect chemical mixture of high ordered success, not chaos. I was not into the whole comics business my entire life, but I always enjoyed Marvel characters coming alive on screen. But how could I have imagined that the admirable characters who were all awesome on their own, could have even more impact all gathered together? To be honest, no matter how much i want to whine about the very predictable storyline that could potentially be the only flaw in this movie, I gotta say, even the storyline is one of the element that makes this movie glorious. I mean, come on, this is comics!! It would actually be foolish to expect a complicated storyline. If the plot was too complex with twists and all, then we can't focus on characters. Marvel was smart in that they kept the plot simple and sweet for this grand movie with so many great characters - heroes defeat the bad guys. No mind games.Now then, our heroes... My gosh!! the untamed and invincible Hulk with surprisingly advanced brain, proud first avenger Captain America with super strength and mighty shield, the one and only sassy genius/mechanics master Iron man, mighty Thor The God and Guardian of Earth, handyman Hawkeye the archer, and the sneaky spies Black Widow and Nick Fury... So we got all combinations - handiness, brain, super strength, persuasive skills, oh and a finishing touch of invincibility. When put together, they obtain the perfect equation for the dream team. I think the thrill and the excitement comes from this perfect combination - filling in the lacking 2% from each character.And of course, the coming together of these characters and the exceptional chemistry of the team has to come from superb acting that contributes to creating genuine and believable characters that may even delude audience into thinking they are for real. Especially for Mark Ruffalo, I gotta apologize to Ed Norton, he did a better and marvellous job of portraying the complete opposite of Hulk state - a quiet and introverted genius whom you could never guess to be the most wild and hot tempered monster. And Robert, Robert, Robert... He is simply a darling as always, smooth talking and adding the perfect comic relief at the right moments - but never losing his cool as Iron Man when he's on duty. All in all, this movie would be a legend to comics fans!!! Loved loved loved it!!",10,2,6,18 May 2012
