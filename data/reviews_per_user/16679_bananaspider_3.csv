10 Cloverfield Lane," What did I just watch here?
","I'll get to the point. Most of the movie was a soap opera taking place in a fallout shelter. The last 10 minutes of the movie was the escape into the creature filled world with one, relatively small, creature on ground and some spacecraft-like flying creatures. Add a couple special effects and done. Wow! That was the movie? I felt deprived at the sudden ending as I thought it was just then about to REALLY get started. At that point I said to myself, man, this must be a three hour movie! I was just starting to get excited. Boy was I wrong and disappointed. Not a mumble of a word, a wow, a whoopee, a clap, nor a whimper of a good time could be heard from anywhere in the theater. Just silence and a feeling of loss for words as to not believing that this is all that was given to them. Sorry, but this definitely could have waited for small screen DVD release. Save you $$.",5,2,7,11 March 2016
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Pretty good movie except for the America bashing by Ferrell. Made him look stupid.
",The humor was great! And it was a SWEET movie to say the least.,7,1,5,2 July 2020
"Hail, Caesar!"," Quite entertaining throughout
","I had no clue what this movie was about when going in. I was quite thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie. Had a simple concept of the main man keeping control of the Hollywood scenario back in the day. Jumped to some entertaining in studio filming with some pretty good humor mixed in. The story was straight forward with a satirical look at things. Definitely worth it if you are not the type that needs straight action and/or intriguing story to pull you through the movie. If all you need is good acting from all and a story that is entertaining and fulfilling, then this one you will enjoy. Some of the later reviews on here are hitting this movie way to hard as they must have been expecting an epic or something.",7,1,2,4 April 2016
