Antz," Definitely watch it.
","I first saw this film in 2004, if I remember correctly, and I still watch it today.Antz is the story of an ant called 'Z' (don't let it's pronouncing as 'Zee' put you off), who dreams of a world outside of the dull life of the ant worker in a colony filled with millions of ants. He sets off for a place called 'Insectopia', a place in which 'You can be your own ant', and 'The streets are paved with food', with the colony's Princess. There, this proves to be true. Their fun is slightly short lived, however, when Colonel Cutter finds Princess Bala, and forcibly takes her back to the colony with him. However, the Colony's General, Mandible, is planning to create a stronger colony, by washing away the workers, who he considers to be 'Weak'. Can Z get back to the Colony in time to save the workers, Princess Bala, and the Queen?I've only given it 9/10 because I feel that the film was, if anything, too short. I don't think we saw enough of Insectopia in the film's 83 minute length (including the credits), and I think seeing a bit of the colony's past may have been nice, and perhaps a bit of the Princess's life in the palace would have been good. Possibly a few flashbacks to Z's past would have been nice too.Overall, the film is funny, and I enjoy the sarcastic character of Z, voiced by Woody Allen, a lot. Quite a few quotable lines, as well as a heart warming story that proves that no-one is insignificant. Definitely one of these 'Why hasn't this film got a sequel?' films.",9,0,0,17 February 2011
The Girl Next Door," A Personal favourite of mine
","The Girl Next Door is probably my favourite film for many reasons. Firstly, I can relate to Matthew's character. Second, there a tons of quotable lines that could be you can use, without many people knowing where you got them from, and it also highly lives up to it's 'Romantic Comedy' status (although quite different to normal Rom Coms), with a nice twist at the ending.Matthew Kidman (played by Emile Hirsch) is in his senior year of High School. He tries to writing what he'll 'Always remember' about High School, but quickly realises that he has nothing to write about. Later on, whilst he is taking the trash out and practising his speech for a scholarship to Georgetown, he notices a girl, Danielle (played by Elisha Cuthbert), who he instantly falls for. Later, she catches him looking at her getting undressed, to which she seemingly angrily goes round to his house to tell his parents. However, this is just the start, as she pushes him to do things 'He never thought he could do', and gives him something to remember about High School. She, however, has a dark past, which threatens their relationship when Matthew finds out.I am giving this film an easy 10/10. You would probably struggle to find another Rom Com like this one. Some people may call this film 'Strange', and it is a bit, I suppose, but there is definitely a sort of uniqueness to it, that separates it from films like 'Love Actually' and 'The Holiday'.Should you watch it once? Yes. Should you watch it again? Yes. Should you watch it for a college project? If you want to. It's your life, after all (just don't say that TheDoctorAnd suggested to do it if you do).",10,4,5,17 February 2011
Dead Poets Society," Inspiring & Life Changing
","This film is set in 1959. A new English teacher at an elite prep school inspires his students to 'Seize the day'. This involves very unusual teaching methods (some of which appear to be frowned upon by his peers), although he appears to improve the lives of his students with these methods. He is able to make his students love poetry, even reviving an old club from Keating's days at Welton so they can discuss poetry and 'Woo Women'. However, the film also shows that the students take 'Seizing the day' a bit too far, being unaware as to knowing 'the time for action and the time for caution'.The most powerful scene in this film is probably Neil's death. The use of sound throughout is extraordinary, the reactions to his death are also very emotional, and the idea that Neil has no control over his short-long term future due to his very strict father makes this outcome very believable and more upsetting.I think a lot of people can relate to many of the teenage characters. I find I can relate to Todd because I also have very low confidence, and have many of the problems involved with him in the film i.e. talking in front of groups of people. Charlie/Nuwanda (the struggle to get the girl), Neil (strict parents/wanting to do what you want but feeling trapped).I give this film top marks because it truly is one of the best films ever made. It is very inspiring, and I truly do believe that since I watched it for the first time, I have gained confidence in real life.One of Robin Williams' best films. I also recommend Good Will Hunting if you enjoyed this movie.",10,0,0,2 March 2013
Back to the Future," Great Classic
","In 1985, Doc Brown invents a time machine out of a DeLorean. However, when he is shot down during a test run of the machine, his friend Marty McFly hops in, and finds himself in 1955. He ends up 'Saving' his father from a car crash (the action which led his father and mother to fall in love with each other), meaning his and his sibling's existences are now at stake, so he must find a way to get his parents together before he disappears completely.This film is a comedic Science Fiction film with a great script and story. Great performances by the entire cast, with Huey Lewis and the News' songs 'The Power of Love' and 'Back in Time' also deserving praise.I recommend you watch this film, as well as it's sequels. These films are frequently shown on ITV 2.",10,6,7,13 February 2013
The Godfather," Piece of Art
","It is the end of 1945 (after the war), and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has returned from the army. This film follows his rise to Don of the Corleone mafia family, having originally said he wanted nothing to do with it.This film is one of my favourites because it is so masterfully crafted. The script is sheer perfection. The performances are golden. It will be extremely difficult for anyone involved in this production to say that it was anything less than the best film they have worked on. The only criticism I have is that I remember that I had to watch this film a second time, as I originally couldn't understand very much of what Vito was saying.Overall, one should not be allowed to die without watching this film. This, along with it's sequel (The Godfather Part II), are offers you can't refuse.",10,0,1,17 January 2013
