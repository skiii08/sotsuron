The Ring," Disappointed...
","I hate to say it, but I may have fallen victim to media hype on this movie. I thought this movie was terrible. It sparked memories of Jacob's Ladder, and such over 'scary' movies that incorporated disturbing images and quick cuts to 'bubbling blood shots' and such to mortify it's unlucky viewers. Throughout this entire movie I kept waiting for something to catch me...suck me into the story. This movie lacked focus. The entire portion of the movie where she tried to figure out the puzzle of 'who is this woman, and why is she haunting me?' was dumb. At that point I found my self saying 'who cares'...bring back the video and watch it again or something. The more I think about this movie the more I feel like it's a cheap copy (which it is), and we all know a copy of anything is not as good as the original. Bottom line...I was very disappointed...maybe Ringu will be better.",3,0,1,5 March 2003
Signs," Get over yourselves...
","I loved this move! One thing I am really sick of is people, for whom I welcome their opinion, who comment about how BAD this movie was. They all seem to say 'I expected to learn more about crop circles'. Give me a break! If you want info about crop circles go watch TLC! This further promotes my view that some movies should forgo the trailers and movie posters to 'protect' these type of people. People see these things and start drooling like some Pavlovian pooch, expecting to know EXACTLY what the movie is going to be about. THAT'S THE POINT! Shyamalan IS the next Spielberg (before he sold out). He has studied such move greats like Hitchcock and paid attention. His use of darkness, sounds, and depth of characters are prime examples of this. He would rather you be scared of what you can imagine in your head, rather than what cool CGI graphic our billion dollar studio can create. This movie is definitely a 10 in my book.
