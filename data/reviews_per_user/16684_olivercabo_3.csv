Lucky Number Slevin," Ridiculous, throwing away the money
","Lucky number Slevin is a case of justifying the unjustifiable using 'surprising' flashbacks. That film has an obsession trying to surprise the spectator, doesn't matter if there is no connexion with the plot. You are constantly, and all the time, exposed to flashbacks that try explain things of the immediate future, even if they are irrelevant. We can see the surprise factor used in no less than 10 times along the movie, loosing completely the effect.Otherwise, the screenplay is forced and absurd, all the characters use 'cool' sentences every shot, that kind of sentences that worked in the past with little doses, but that loose all effect in the ridiculous story of Lucky number Slevin. The main character wants to be like similar characters done in the past by Brad Pitt. It is sad to see such a clearly failed aim. Although Josh Harnett is a good actor, he sees himself doing such absurd things like being half naked during the whole first part of the movie, unnecessary, unjustified again.It deserves also a mention the funny character performed by Bruce Willis (Mr.Goodka), who arrives repeatedly with a ridiculous terrific sound, as he would be Darth Vader, explaining mostly senseless things.In my point of view there is no main purpose, no connexion, nothing new able to impress us in that movie, we are simply talking about a bad movie that even its good cast and good music can't hide a big problem of intentions.",2,10,28,24 April 2006
The Dark Knight," Boring
","I am really astonished reading all the commentaries and the incredible average mark of the film. This movie is simply deceiving.When I first saw Batman Begins, I really loved it. From then I began to investigate more about Christohper Nolan and his films. I discovered also that Memento was directed by him, as well as Insomnia with Al Pacino and Robin Williams, highly interesting thriller placed in Alaska.Back to 'Knight', I found it firstly too long. I went with 3 friends and all of them slept the whole last hour.Secondly, and probably the most important from my point of view, the plot is not surprising and of a quality you wouldn't expect from such an expensive movie.More, Christian Bale is not the same. In that film Batman as well as Bruce Wayne are poor, somehow sad, definitely not inspiring. Nothing comparable to his performance in Psycho. All the action scenes are the same, batman knocking and slamming with its legs, arms and fists. Where is the intelligence and slyness? The highly praised Heath Ledger is not bad, but the character, this new Jocker is deceiving again. Not fun, not subtle nor ironic, simply violent.To finish with, this film is too long, unnecessarily complicated, and if you see the images of the trailer, you have seen it all.",4,16,31,7 September 2008
The Matrix," Â¿Why not the best movie of the 90's?
","The Matrix is the first part of an action and science fiction trilogy, probably the best of them, that not only shows a deep and brilliant story through an imaginative, creative, and also breathtaking screenplay that demands more than one view, but excellent photography as well as a superb performance.The Matrix suggests the next step after Internet, everything is available thorough the mind; all, faster, getting what you and only you are able to admit, there are no limits but yourself, somehow about that lies in the heart of that masterpiece. That suggested power doesn't come alone, we are in a future near 2200 and machines save themselves against humans, which are literally out, projecting their own reality while providing machines their energy by doing it.I am in love about the characters, I love Morpheus, Trinity, of course Neo, even MR. Smith, such a big love is only possible in masterpiece. Who is Keanu Reeves? And who is Lauren Fishburn, I don't know and I don't mind. And what can be said about action? Simply new, fresh, quick, slow, strong, slight, the same time subtle and brutal, even fine, plenty of sensibility. I know people able to read this has already seen the movie, I did more than twice. I simply wanted to sign down my pure admiration for that story and demonstrate it here. Thanks to the Wachowski's and you for reading. Watch it again, that's my recommendation.",10,0,1,28 January 2007
