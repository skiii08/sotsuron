Blade Runner 2049," Stunning
","I did wait 30+ years to see this and was the only person in the theatre this morning at the very first show on its first release here in Dubai. My biggest take away is the score by Hans Zimmer. Not only did it honor the original music with a tribute to Rutger Hauer's final scene in BR, it presented outrageous volumes of synthesized leads and strings swelling from side to side in genuine majesty to the visuals most of the way through the film. I was mesmerized and in awe of the powerful support this gave to the plot. The audio montages and foley FX were right up there in quality leaving me in no doubt that I now have to admit that the original BR has been displaced as my all time Number 1 movie by this stunning, elegant production. It is simply breathtaking in its presentation and well worth SciFi history.",10,4,14,5 October 2017
