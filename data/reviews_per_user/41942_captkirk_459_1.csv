The Avengers," Avengers movie review no spoilers
","Avengers movie review Oh my god I love this movie. I went with a friend who prefers to be not named. We both loved it. It was incredible, amazing, and awesome movie. This time I will say the plot first. Col. Nick Fury brings together Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye together to become the Avengers and fight Loki and his army of Chiturai. Robert Downey JR is Tony Stark. There is no one else that can play this role and if they get someone else he will pale in comparison. Chris Evans is so awesome as Captain America. Chris Hemsworth really nails the role as Thor. If anyone is worried about Mark Ruffalo not doing a good job as Banner. I almost feel he was better than Ed Norton. I like the Norton as Bruce too but Ruffalo really feels like Banner. He is incredible as Banner. The Hulk looks Incredible. He looks like Mark Ruffalo. You feel it. Scarlett Johansson does a great job as Black Widow. There is a scene where she speaks in a foreign language she does such a good job. She is not a perfect Black Widow but she does a good job of bringing her own take to the role. Jeremy Renner is Hawkeye. He was my fan pick. I feel like they listened to the fans when they casted him for the role. Tom Hiddleston is so sinister as Loki. He was great in the Thor movie but he is even better in this movie. Samuel L Jackson really nails the role as Nick Fury. He does such a commanding role. He knows how to take charge. Clark Greg as Agent Phil Coulson does a great job too. He knows how to take charge and he was such a fan boy around Captain America. Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill is so good. She is a great SHIELD agent. The Shield Hellcarrier is like right out of the comic book. WOW! The Quinn Jet is great too. Loki's Army is so amazing looking. Then you have the Levathion. It is not Fing Fang Foo the Dragon from the Iron Man comics. But it looks so incredible anyway. They call the cosmic cube a Tesseract. If you don't know what that means basically it can open up wormholes. The first time I heard that word is when I read the book Wrinkle in Time when I was a child so that is how I understand what it is. Everything you wanted is in this film and more. When I saw the Artist I thought no movie would beat it until now. I feel this movie has smashed my scale. I friend gave it 11/10 and so am I. So to quote Spinal tap. This dial goes to 11. For this movie it is 11/10. It is that great. This will be on Blip TV and Youtube soon. Big Guy Movie Reviews",10,1,3,5 May 2012
