Despicable Me 2," Despicable, With a Dose of Delightful
","This is a tough one to rate and review. On the one hand, the rendering and quality of the CGI is up to the highest standards (animated films seem to be getting more beautiful with each year that passes); the minions provide the core comedy of the film, being cute and lovable idiots who at heart are really just immoral, child-like agents of chaos; and there are plenty of nods to sci-fi and horror that I found littered about the film.But on the other hand, it seems tired. It doesn't feel like it's added anything new to animated films. Gone are the days of The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Aladdin, where our heroes aren't complete and utter idiots, but intelligent beings with flaws and emotions we can all connect with.Although the minions are fun, I found this film to be another addition to the 'Let's Dumb Down the Human Race and Little Kids with Silly Idiotic Secretively Violent Characters' sub-genre of the animated film industry, and the film industry at large. Villains and stupidity have become all the rage.Despicable Me 2 was on my watch list, and I'm glad I gave it a whirl, but I'm hoping one day we get an animated film that brings the same emotional impact the classics used to bring to the table instead of the increasing Hollywood addiction to making stupidity and violence fun by hiding it within seemingly harmless characters in kids movies.",5,0,0,15 May 2015
Gravity," Zero Gravity
","Although visually engaging and creatively directed, Gravity fails to live up to the hype generated by critics (possibly the same critics who slam the genuinely thought-provoking and emotionally powerful films that I tend to enjoy). It is a small-scale disaster/survival movie set in orbit, yet the space-travelling debris causing dilemmas for the main characters is not the disaster – no; the real catastrophe here is the star, Sandra Bullock, whose dialogue and questionable actions became so frustrating that not only did I wish her character would just drift off into infinite nothingness, but I spent the entire night after viewing this film in a state of rage and utter confusion as to how something with so much potential can drift off into an inescapable and non-redeeming black hole.",3,1,4,2 May 2015
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Persia's Prince Fit to be King
","Why spectacles like this fail at the box office and with critics, I do not know. My tastes do not fall in line with the general crowd (a self-confessed Shyamalan devotee here), which is probably why I left this movie wanting to see more of the Prince and his acrobatics.There's nothing about this film I didn't like. The score was solid and fitting for a sword and sandal epic; the scenery was beautiful; the cast all meshed in well; the fantasy elements were impressive; and there were character's that I'd happily follow into a sequel.Alas, the majority and the money machine win again.In saying that, I'm not upset it's a one-time event. So sit back, enjoy, and travel to an imaginary land you'll only get to see once, because no sands of time will ever take us back to help generate buzz for a sequel.",7,0,0,6 May 2015
The Town," Much to Say About This 'Town'
","Say what you want about him, but Ben Affleck does have the acting chops to pull of various amounts of roles. In 'The Town', he shows us through directing, writing and acting credits just how much of a talent he is and what he can offer us in the upcoming Batman V. Superman.It's now 2015, so it took me 5 years to get around to this movie, and I have to say it was a welcome surprise. I've never been to Charlestown and don't know if the crime is accurately portrayed in the movie, but if it is, it's the kind of story that helps you connect and understand the robbers, why they do what they do, how it's a taught behaviour, how it's all part of growing up in certain places, how it's a legacy business.I switched this film off thinking about money. Money is just paper, and all these guards and police, why are they putting their lives at risk for paper? Why are robbers being shot and killed . . . for paper? Isn't that an insane thing for humanity to fight over, for people to be killed over? Not all the robbers are saints of course, but they're not all bad either. The FBI in this movie came off more like the villains for me because they used every slimy, ratty method they could to try and bring these 'bad guys' down.This film is rich in its ability to show a different kind of class than many would be used to, and gives an insight into why some people take the path of lawlessness. I highly recommend it for people who like to see different sides of the fence.",7,0,0,17 May 2015
Interstellar," Stellar: Another Nolan Treat
","I like to keep my reviews simple and spoiler free, and with films like Interstellar it truly is best to watch without an iota of a spoiler. Nolan has just performed another Inception (at least into my mind, and I hope into every other mind who spends well-earned time with the Nolan's), bringing advanced scientific theory into the mainstream via the Hollywood Blockbuster. Nolan is making smart movies, and not treating audiences like idiots, which is what every director and producer needs to start doing a bit more of.Hans Zimmer's score is truly wonderful. Matt shows great acting range. There are a lot of tearful moments where I just couldn't tear myself from the screen. The sound design had a refreshing change in style.Now If you'll excuse me, I need to go brush up on my Quantum Mechanics.",9,3,8,2 May 2015
Predator," The Ultimate Movie Experience
","I saw this movie when I was 5 years old, and still, at the age of 32, I watch it nearly every year. I never tire of this masterpiece.Why is it one of the greatest action/sci-fi/horror films of all time? Because it's director John McTiernan at his best, it has a cast of talented macho men running around in the jungle firing witty dialogue and big guns at every leaf or tree branch that looks out of place, and the slow-burn build-up to the epic last act keeps your heart rate steadily increasing until you think it's going to explode out of your chest.The Predator itself is one of the best designed creatures in the history of creature design. Stan Winston's imagination has been immortalised by this creature alone.The greatest part of the movie though: Alan Silvestri's thumping, pumping, bravely brass score. It's close to being the most perfect score to have ever been written for a movie. Every note, every horn, every drum beat feels like if the film had a bone fide soul, Silvestri was channelling it.If you have not seen this movie, there may be something wrong with you, so get to the video store, fly there on a chopper if you have to, and see what a real action movie looks like.",10,4,4,14 May 2015
Now You See Me," Now I've Seen It, You Probably Should Too
","INTRO: Hollywood is the biggest magician of them all, waving their magic wands over our eyes every time we sit down to partake in the art form of film. Now You See Me is a good attempt to pull the rug out from under my eyes, but in the end, what we're not supposed to see coming I managed with ease. Perhaps all the tricks have been played in the cinema and it's rare to be able to fool an audience anymore.PROS: Ed Solomon is a great writer and this is another one of his excellent scripts, creating great, comical characters with whimsy lines and personalities, namely that of Woody Harrelson's character. Bryan Tyler produces some excellent music for this film. He has a knack for big, bold scores that can make a scene larger than it actually is.CONS: Jesse Eisenberg. I can handle him in small doses. The film is not as intelligent as it pretends to be, but if you put all the problems and extremities of the plot aside you can just enjoy it for what it is.OUTRO: I've never really been a fan of director, Letterier, but here he has probably produced his best work. I compare this film to 'The Prestige', which is far more superior, yet this manages to be far more fun.",7,0,0,8 May 2015
Big Hero 6," Animated Avengers: Another Superhero Story
","Big Hero 6 in a nutshell is basically an Avengers-style story where A) a team of heroes get together to, B) fight an evil villain, and instead of live action it's done in, C) computer generated imagery. There's a dash of, D) emotional conflicts, and, E) humorous characters, which leads to, F) much of a muchness. Superhero stories are becoming all the same, and trying to hide the clichés and tropes inside CGI doesn't change the fact that most of it has been seen and done before. Big Hero 6 felt at times that it was trying to be a live action film, and might have benefited from it.What did impress me though was the villain whom had a very impressive method of villainy.If you want much of the same as you've already seen but need it to look really pretty, really colourful, and want your kids to learn all about how much fun illegal gambling is, how violence and healing can work hand-in-hand, and how forgiveness comes once you've unleashed that violence, then by all means, watch it.",4,3,6,19 May 2015
Jurassic World," Just what the World Needed...Dinosaurs Done Right
","Just recently I wrote a few reviews for some low-budget sci-fi creature-feature movies that posed the question of what they would look like if given a hundred million dollars. I finally have my answer, and that is Jurassic World.I was gobsmacked through this whole movie. It's an event, a spectacle, and just good ol' monster fun with some truly frightening scenes and one really disturbing scene which shocked the hell out of me.I have a few gripes with it, but I also have a few gripes with all the Jurassic films. Spielberg is as flawed a director as anyone and his Jurassic Park movies were filled with some illogic. This updated version fixes those flaws then makes new ones.Aside from that. EPIC!!!",9,13,38,16 June 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Battle to be the Best of the New Trilogy
","Directing and visuals: quite stunning at times, utilizing the scenery in every way possible to create the richly detailed Middle-Earth we have come to expect. It also serves as a reminder of Peter Jackson's talent, that, to be honest, could be better distributed towards films of more originality.The Score: Again, like its two predecessors, lacks the oomph that Lord of the Rings managed to grace my ears with. Howard Shore seems more restrained and less interested, although I'm sure that's not how he approached the film.The film: Gold and War vs. Love, Honour and Peace. I enjoyed that aspect to the third film, but in the end, the One Ring and Gold are basically the same thing, and I just completed watching the finale of what is essentially a Lord of the Rings reboot/prequel/retread.",7,0,1,2 May 2015
Scream," Taking My Love of Movie Reviews One Step Too Far
","I first watched this as a teenager and was blown away by the first ten minutes, and after the impressive opening of this film, was kept hooked and entertained the whole way through. The first frame through to the last showcases, despite a few flaws, what an almost flawlessly perfect horror movie looks like. Scream is well known by now for revitalising a dead genre, and in doing so, created its own, and burrowed its way deep into my subconscious that I screamed out in agony when they not only screwed up Scream 4, but flat out denied us the promised Scream 5 and 6.Keeping this review Spoiler-free is hard considering it's the type of movie where twists and turns and red herrings is what keeps it entertaining. It's the type of film where you have this one conversation with yourself the whole way through: 'he's the killer. No. He's the killer. No. He's the killer. No. He's the killer.' I never guessed the killer.Kevin Williamson has always been one of my favourite writers and ideas man (when he's writing films and not crappy television shows), and Scream shows him at his best. Wes Craven has an uncanny knack of creating memorable icons. It must have been his destiny to scar people's brains with terror-ific, unforgettable images. As a child he probably sat in bed thinking: 'How do I make other people not be able to sleep at night?' Neve Campbell is the perfect scream queen, marred only by the fact she won't do nudity.Marco Beltrami's Scream score is still one of his best musical works to this day. Nothing he has done since Scream and two of its sequels has ever come close in brilliance to the unique sound he created for this and those films.This movie truly is a Scream and I gave it, at a time when the internet wasn't really around that much, the greatest word of mouth ever. I still enjoy sitting down with people who haven't had the pleasure of watching it and seeing their reactions for the first time.It's most certainly a Screamer.",10,1,1,15 May 2015
Creed II," Drago is the better person.
","Adonis is a privileged fighter who grew up with money. He disrespects Rocky. Blames Rocky and everyone else for his bad decisions, and I truly believed he should have lost to Drago, the underdog with nothing in life but his father. The Dragos are the heroes of this story.",5,2,5,22 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Bring Back George Lucas!
","Hated it. Was bored in the opening scene and the boredom continued through to the end. It wasn't Star Wars. Trying to capture the original star wars in 2016 was a bad move that only hurt the franchise. There was little depth to anything force related, there was no memorable dialogue, the music was highly unmemorable (snooze John Williams, please retire your best work is done), the only aspect I enjoyed was Kylo Ren. Snoke, Jesus, don't even get me started on what a failure his attendance was. Fans actually destroy their own franchises in the end by demanding what they know, and when they get what they know, they cry about it. I for one enjoyed and miss the richness of the sequels and believe the whole franchise would have been better off under Lucas's guidance.",2,91,142,11 January 2016
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Madagascar 3: My Least Wanted
","If I was a toddler, I would have been amazed at the frenzy of colours splashing across the screen. Unfortunately I'm now in my 30's and need more than a bright colour palette to appease the child hiding somewhere within.What I like most about animated films is their ability to usually cater for both adults and children (at times the animated films even feel like an adult movie hidden within a computer generated environment). Madagascar 3 felt more 'just for the easily entertained'. To be blatantly honest, the film is really not that funny despite the amount of talent involved.King Julian is one of my all-time favourite animated characters, but the King Julian I fell in love with in Mad 1 and 2 disappeared in screen time and stripped down to a form of his lesser self in this instalment, being replaced by the less likable Stefano who's not just a blubber of a sealion, but also a blubbering mess.If you prefer a visual overload without any sort of narrative depth or comedy anyone over five can enjoy, then this is the movie for you.",3,3,5,7 May 2015
