Black Swan," A film about mental disease
","I'm underwhelmed. The film seems to be vastly over-rated, if not all-out misunderstood. Far as I can tell it is a depiction of schizophrenia and of the dangers of losing control. I wasn't too surprised to learn that it has the same creator as Requiem for a Dream, for the resemblance is indeed strong.What I liked least was the depiction of drug use - I liked Portman's character way too much to see her depicted as so weak-willed. But really, the film makes the most sense as a straight depiction of the slow advance of schizophrenia, with perhaps a bit of warning against drug use thrown in for good measure. It would be a better film if it did not take so much refuge in ambiguity and hallucinations, however.",4,11,19,24 February 2011
Ender's Game," A warning about the obscenity that is militarism.
","I have read the first two Ender books years ago, so I knew what to expect from the movie. And it delivered. 'Ender's Game' is a deeply disturbing tale of a child made into a monster by the fears of his society. Much like 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' at its most puissant, it makes one wonder what is there in humanity worth protecting, and at what price.",Null,12,16,16 October 2017
