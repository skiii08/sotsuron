Blade Runner 2049," Boring
","I don't know how anyone can really like it (maybe they have insomnia and liked this movie as a good cure for it) . I rewatched Blade runner 1981 (and found out it's still a brilliant film) and after that tried to watch the new one... Well, it was so boring i felt asleep after 20 or 30 minutes! And i'm not going to give it a second chance. Special effects are good but movie needs smth more than just effects to be called good or interesting.",1,7,12,26 March 2018
Yesterday," Awfull
",How can it be that someone who was (and will be again) a music teacher sings out of tune and has huge problems with rythm? It was the worst performance of the Beatles' songs i've ever heard ('Yesterday' was the only song he did good). His manager should have hired a teacher for him or made him a songwriter for Ed Sheeran. The love story is uninteresting.,1,6,13,28 October 2019
A Quiet Place," not so bad but illogical
","1) Every human constantly produces noise: we can't control our heartbeat, and what we do while we sleep. And it's never said which level of noise attracts these creatures (but they tried to control their breath so i think they can hear even those noises we are used to ourselves, like our own heart) And this couple somehow made a baby!
2) It's a mistake to think that walking barefoot is quiet - it isn't: sand squeaks under feet, the rustle of grass etc , and it would be better to walk in smth soft
3) light signals: somebody has to turn it on in a case of invasion and make it quiet which is just impossible to do with a lever (it would be to noisy)
4) So, the army and scientists couldn't deal with these monsters and a common family became the smartest on the whole planet, but not smart enough to look after their kids. The end just doesn't make a sense to me. And if it was so easy why they didn't try to make it earlier",4,0,2,4 February 2019
La La Land," expendable!
","The story is inconclusive, narration is broken: we have start of the plot, just a piece of culmination and then final. What happened between? Am I myself must invent the motives of the two heroes? This gap in narration also makes the kaleidoscope of 'what if...' senseless. Tapdance is muted by music - nonsense, this dance is supposed to be heard! Main hero walks in the same shoes for tap-dance till the end (what for? he will never tap again). This movie reminds me of Cafe society but simpler and with dancing. The music is good, but 'Whiplash' had good music too and it was also stronger in many ways. Though I liked the scene in observatory and what the hero of Ryan Gosling told 'Mia' about jazz. So, This movie is nice to watch only once. I will certainly re-watch 'Hello, Dolly' or 'West side story'... but La la land? never again!",1,11,17,17 January 2017
