Child 44," Disgusting and shameless anti-communist, anti-Soviet and anti-Russian Western propaganda!
","As a Greek, who lived for 12 years in Eastern Europe, in the so-called 'real socialism', I saw this disgusting 'masterpiece' of sh**, with the clear conscious that what I'm going to see, will be another one cold-war, anti-communist, anti-Soviet (and in the end, anti-Russian), 100% pure western propaganda, full of lies about the Stalin era and the socialism in general and I wasn't wrong. Let me explain something first: In Russia there are 4 seasons- summer, autumn and spring! Not only winter and snow!Also the Russian people are not beasts, neither monsters, as they are 'delivered' to us from the Anglo-Saxon's propaganda garbage-movies. Russian people and Russia have never made genocides and crimes against humanity, like the WASP civilization did it (See the Nazi-German genocide in WW2 and the colonialist British genocide against India for example AND NOT ONLY!!).Stalin compared to Hitler, who brought bloodshed in Europe to more than 80 million people, compared to Churchill and all the British elites, who massacred millions in the anti-colonialist revolutions around the world, compared to Truman, who in one day exterminated hundreds of thousands of people in Nagasaki and Hiroshima (and the US crimes against humanity are continuing until today, with millions of victims around the world), WAS A 'SAINT'. The only crimes (executions after obviously rigged trials) that he committed, were against his own comrades from the politburo and especially the elite of the party, but also against simple party members and thousands of officers of NKVD and Red Army, in the dark years of 1936-1938, but not against soviet people in general. Yes, millions of people went to the GULAG camps, not only for political reasons, but also for criminal reasons. But anyway, millions of them returned, after their conviction. The foolish and totally idiotic, western-propaganda conception, that Stalin killed as much soviets as Hitler killed (28 millions) and it is in use now, by the West against Russia, in its confrontation for Ukraine, was fully rejected since 1991, in the Yeltsin (a totally Western puppet!) period from the Official State Archives of the Russian Federation, which clearly confirmed that:'Â… after the end of the Civil War in Russia (1922-1923) and until the death of Stalin (1953), the convicted to death and executed citizens in Soviet Union were 918.000 !'I have nothing more to say except that, the cynicism, the double-speaking, the falsification of History will not stop the fall of the WASP, globalist, capitalistic, Imperialist Civilization! Fascism and Racism are your own deadly babies!! You build up an un-human world only for the bankers and the capitalists AND NOT FOR THE PEOPLE! Your time is up!",1,18,46,22 July 2015
