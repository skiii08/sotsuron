The Incredible Hulk," 6/10 flash drives swallowed whole
","The movie is actually better than I remembered. Telling the origin story with a credits opening montage is a really good idea for this character. There are some serious moments that work well and some funny moments that work well. Unfortunately there are some serious moments that end up being more silly as well.The movie has a great cast as well. Edward Norton is a really good Bruce Banner and I remember being disappointed back in the day when I heard he was recast. Tim Roth is very entertaining as a villain. Him screaming 'IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?' before getting yeeted into a tree is easily the best moment in the film. I wish we got the return of Tim Blake Nelson as the Leader in a later movie, he was a lot of fun in this one already. William Hurt is pretty good as General Ross, although my favourite scene of his is definitely the pre-post-credits scene with Robert Downey Jr.. Not a fan of Liv Tyler's performance and character though. Lovable Pizza Dad just wants to take care of Bruce before Betty comes along and steals him away, leaving him to feed her suddenly ex. And then she pulls the 'If you kill him, you're the monster' at the end, despite having no idea if they'd be in any way capable of containing the Abomination.",6,1,1,15 May 2020
Iron Man 2," I want 6/10 birds
","The sequel actually has a lot of great elements. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is a blast. Don Cheadle taking over as Rhodey works well; he and Robert Downey Jr. have great chemistry. The soundtrack led by AC/DC is excellent. The action overall is very good, with Black Widow's hallway fight scene deserving special mention. The senate hearing with Senator Stern, making Pepper CEO and Tony's last birthday party are all entertaining scenes. Tony suiting with the chest on the race track is one of my favourite suit-ups in the entire MCU. The best shot in the movie has to be Tony eating a donut while sitting in a giant donut.Unfortunately there are some not-so-great elements as well. Ivan Vanko, apart from the two lines 'If you could make God bleed, people would cease to believe in Him.' and 'I want my bird.' is probably one of the worst MCU villains. I don't blame the filmmakers though, if the behind-the-scenes stories of Mickey Rourke are true. I am also not a fan of the discovering a new element hidden in the expo layout plotline, even if the scene where he makes the element is also pretty cool. Also not a fan of how just putting a new element in his chest somehow immediately cures the palladium poisoning?Also Kate Mara is in this movie for 2 seconds. Just thought you ought to know.",6,0,0,15 May 2020
Thor," 4/10 dogs big enough to ride
","The movie's best moments are its comedy. Everything else just does not really work for me. I can't take the more serious fantasy elements as seriously as the movie clearly wants me to. Everything that happens in this movie feels like it happens way too fast for beings whose lifespans are approximately 5000 years, yet it also feels like nothing actually happens in the movie? People joke about how forgettable the sidekicks are, and they're not wrong. Also Thor and Loki's wigs are not good, and Thor's eyebrows are the worst. And so. many. Dutch. angles. why.Hawkeye, whom I love, gets the absolute worst cameo in what is probably the best scene in the movie.It's not all bad. It is always nice to see more Coulson. Seeing people on the opposite end of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s actions was a clever choice. I really like the Destroyer's design. It is also the first installment in the ongoing Thor Smushes His Face Into Glass saga. Seriously, if you haven't picked up on this yet, he does this in every movie he's in.Odin is the second Marvel Bad Dadâ„¢ in a long list of them.",4,0,0,15 May 2020
Parasite," 10/10 crossed lines
","I can't think of anything I didn't like about this movie, or anyone I wouldn't want to show this movie.(Okay but the soundtrack is really good though. Like really good. Like really really really good. Like re",10,1,1,15 May 2020
Iron Man," A box of 8/10 scraps
","The casting of Robert Downey Jr. is, of course, perfect for many reasons and I cannot thank Jon Favreau enough for knowing exactly what this movie needed to be. It is hilarious watching the rest of the cast trying to keep up with Robert's ad-libs. This genuinely feels like a big-budget indie superhero movie and there are very few other movies that hit this tone, and even fewer that do it as well as this one.The film has one of the best first two-thirds out of any MCU film. The origin story is told organically and is actually a really compelling and necessary component of the movie. Everything from Tony getting blown up and kidnapped to remodelling and testing out his suit is great to watch.There are so many excellent individual moments and visual gags. One of my favourites has to be Tony staring in horror at a missile with his own name on it. Terrence Howard saying 'Next time, baby' and then never being in another MCU movie is also iconic.Obadiah Stane is sadly one of the weaker parts of the movie. He's somewhat forgettable, except for the 'TONY STARK was able to build tHiS in a CAVE! with a BoX of SCRAPS!' line. Kudos to the henchman scientist for standing up to his evil boss and just being like 'sorry man, just can't do it' instead of promising to get it done in 24 hours or something.I also just love how well they were able to take moments from this movie and tie them in with the later movies. It works so well as setup for what's to come without sacrificing its own integrity.",8,0,0,15 May 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Now you're thinking with 6/10 portals
","People complain about the humour in this movie (specifically Kat Dennings' character and her intern), but the humour is honestly the best part of the movie for me. Actually, I think this movie is just overall better than the first one. It feels like something actually happens, the twists work better, and the cinematography, sets and costumes all look better. The familial beats also hit their mark with me, especially with regards to Frigga.It's not without flaws though. I still can't quite take the fantasy elements all that seriously. They're better than in the first film, though. The villain really does not work. Jane getting infected by the Aether was a weird choice that seems to be there only to force her into the plot. Sif and the Warriors Three have even less presence in this movie. I am not a fan of crazy Dr. Selvig, especially with Iron Man 3 just prior to this taking PTSD after the Battle of New York seriously. I don't like the concept of Dr. Selvig's magic portal sticks, but they were used really creatively in the final fight scene.",6,0,0,16 June 2020
Annihilation," 9/10 refractions and reflections
","Annihilation will hopefully always be one of my favourite movies. Everything about it just works for me: visuals, sound, story, themes, atmosphere.One of my favourite aspects is the sound. There is one song in the movie that encapsulates its themes really well, and is played several times throughout. Other than that, there is no soundtrack except at the very end during Lena's confrontation with the entity. Except, the lack of soundtrack up until this point implies to me that the unreal and unnerving tones are actually coming from the entity, and Lena is hearing what we are hearing. It just works so well to sell the otherness of the entity even more.The themes of pain and self-destruction are, while not subtly, really well incorporated into the story to the point where the literal story doesn't even really matter, and it's more about the internal journey that Lena is going through. I really like the movie's message that pain and trauma will change you irreversibly into someone new, but still you.",9,0,0,15 May 2020
