The Lobster," Postmodern absurdist garbage that masqerades as 'truth'
","The Lobster is a revolting, dull and unfunny film that attempts to be funny (in a blatantly ironic & satirical way) by employing deliberately stilted dialogue delivery and awkward scenes that sometimes present outright disgusting cruelty/gore. As the main theme of the film is to make a mockery out of modern human forms of communications & relationships this is understandable, but it falls like a limp, smelly half-dead fish that flops hopelessly on the sand in the hopes of trying to elicit attention from it's audience.The idea that this is a film about the social conformity and the pressures of marriage and monogamous relationships is typical of a postmodern mindset that arrogantly rejects any kind of stability whatsoever. Besides, is this really a critique of the modern world? Is this really a film about how suffocating monogamous relationships are? If so, it seems to be a film about the pressures of the 20th century rather than the 21st since an increasing amount of people live alone than ever. The question is then: Why does The Lobster seek to satirise such a thing? One answer is partly because it is a film devoted to a specifically air-headed sort of person who lives a fairly modest if not boring state of existence, both in their social and 'professional' lives. Of course, you can debate as much as you want about what 'The Lobster' is about, which really shows how completely pretentious and, at the same time, vacuous it really is.Of course, all this is seen by people who admire the film as very intelligent and daring because, as well all know, laughing at modern existential suffering of humans in the form of presenting scenes full of crude and violent symbology is apparently hilarious - if you're someone with an anti-social, psychopathic or sociopathic mindset, that is. All the scenes are typical of the symbology of an arm-chair psychologist. It seems to make the overall point that people do irrational things - out of fear of loneliness - to belong in society. It screams out: 'This is what we all do.'Ultimately, it is a film that presents a presumptuous and misanthropic view of 'all' human beings with the exception of the arrogant admirations of the 'one' person watching and lapping up the self-indulgent narrative of the film. The fact that this is categorised as 'comedy' only reflects the overall sadomasochistic nature of The Lobster.",1,14,21,25 July 2018
Knives Out," Surpassed my expectations by far.
","I had some doubts when I first saw the trailer. I had initially rolled my eyes and thought that Knives Out would it be a fairly standard, average run-of-the-mill murder mystery that would also try to too hard to be funny that it would come across as arrogant & self-absorbed in its own 'art', similar the posturing tone of the Grand Budapest Hotel. Yet these dismal expectations of Knives Out were thankfully and surprisingly dashed.The film strikes the perfect balance of intrigue, suspense, excitement, eccentricity, warmth and amusement. The entire cast are excellent, particularly Daniel Craig and the main character. There are some really funny scenes too and it's quite difficult to make me laugh out loud at the comedy material applied to most films. Yes, it can of course be argued that Knives Out has the usual tropes of the traditional Agatha Christie styled murder mysteries, but it builds on those traditional tropes and I think it creates something quite unique. It made quite an impression.",10,2,5,30 March 2020
Split," A very entertaining and gripping film in some areas until it's final three quarter mark.
","The film starts off very promising and James McAvoy is excellent in the role. However, we discover that the new 24th alter possesses the powers of Wolverine or some other superhero with extraordinary strength and speed (take your pick). However, it's clear that this beastly 24th personality is no super hero, he's a villain...with super powers. That's right! A super villain!Why couldn't they just leave the film as a thriller without having to introduce the idea that his personality disorder eventually imbued him with super human abilities?! What were they thinking?! By this point the plot becomes corny, silly and overdone because the thriller dimension is shattered.I think a thriller should be at least believable to some extent in order to achieve and sustain your interest and excitement. While this film does achieve it, it doesn't sustain it, given it's sudden break with the thriller genre and embraces comic book mythology near the end",5,0,0,16 January 2020
The Favourite," A complete farce. Highish expectations dashed.
","The film has little direction. Yes, there are characters who drive 'the narrative', but there is little focus and centrality on the queen. Instead we see two women competing for the queen's affections mostly to maximise their personal prestige. These two characters, both being masters of manipulation, define the film's entire content. They aren't redeemable or even likeable in the slightest unless you are the type of person who happens admires powerful machiavellian sorts of people who are venomous towards each other. Oh and apparently that was funny to some members of the audience, though only a minority. I think the only reason it was regarded as so was because they were women who are basically saying subtle passive aggressive things, a bit like the sort of incidents that happen in boorish tv soap dramas. The film would've been better if they had explored more in depth and mademore central the character of the queen but any personal analysis of her was pretty superficial. The trailer that was shown to advertise the film and lure an audience seemed to encapsulate the best bits of in the entire film.The sound was pretty abysmal, repetitive and unbearable to hear during several scenes.There are plenty of 'scenes that are just stuck in for no good reason other than to try to set the tone or establish pacing, but they are excessive and end up dragging out the love triangle story unnecessarily. This is presumably done in the name of artistic license but it all feels a bit forced, as if to make the audience think they've seen more than they actually have. I suppose this magic trick it works for those who are easily impressed by the film's aesthetics and those who favour a long-running dialogue as opposed to a guided plot which allows the potential for more things to actually happen. Good acting doesn't mean much without an engaging plot.Truth be told, I had no idea that the film was directed by the director of The Lobster and Dogtooth. I'm not someone who has ever needed to check a film's director to assess whether it's worth the time to watch it. However, I have found that with Yorgos Lanthimos' films this is highly required as they tend to be so absurdist that they always ruin any attempt to maintain coherence, emotional engagement or intrigue. This film is so absurdist that it feels more like you're watching the raw thoughts in someone's head, a dream, rather than an organised, finished work. For some, the very fact that it is so absurdist and trangresses the traditional boundaries of a film genre would perhaps be appealing and gloriously avante-garde. Personally, I didn't think this and found that this formula started to go stale pretty quickly. Thus, by the end I was left feeling completely unsatisfied.",2,33,64,9 January 2019
Midsommar," Like watching a wounded animal's very gradual demise followed by it's decomposition into nothingness.
","I admit, I went in withfairly high expectations here. I had thought that the film would be less a horror and more based on an analysis of the psychology of being in a cult. The film while initially intriguing becomes abruptly, about halfway through, very painful to watch, probably to compensate for it's lack of substance. If you are intrigued by Midsommar because you're expecting it to be like the Wickerman (original film) you'll be disappointed. The characters are very passive. They are irritatingly idiotic and there are no redeeming features about any of them by the time the film is reaches it's paaaaainfully slooooow conclusion. Believe me, it is painful.The truly bizarre aspect about Midsommar, is that initially the film carries a sense of impending morbid sort of dread, which is very effective.However, the writer/director seems to, later on in the story, drive this morbid dread into overkill, as if to deliberately outrage the audience in an attempt to rival other films that carry a similar genre? Who knows. But this is what ruins the film.It comes across as unnecessary because you are just watching what I have already described in the review's title. It's as if the diretor/writer made it their personal drive to make the film so unbearable in the hopes of outraging the audience. However, it is this drive that ultimately paints Midsommar as a film that is trying to comes across as something more than it is. Unfortunately it is ultimately nothing more than a standard format of a horror film hiding in the clothes of something profound sounding and feeling.",3,19,30,29 March 2020
Parasite," Overrated
","I find it somewhat odd that some people have interpreted this film as anticapitalist. It shines a very narrow light on poverty but it is all conveyed in a very surreal scenario which makes it quite difficult to emotionally engage with the situations that transpire. However, that's not the only reason.The main characters are not particularly likeable, which I'm sure defenders of the film would describe them as morally grey, given the prevailing cultural obsession with the moral ambiguity.It's this morally ambiguous narrative that intends to blur the line of what is good and bad. Nevertheless, this blurring as well as the general surrealness didn't compel me to emotionally engage with the film's story as much as I would've liked. As a result, I found that it really lacks something. It feels like it has rattled out of someone's head, unedited.",5,7,9,29 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," The history of Nazi Germany twisted into postmodern farce
","I usually enjoy satirical comedies, however I am always weary in the liberatory power of satire as it can often present as a double-edged sword. Take this film, for example. While I understand its fictitious narrative conveys the power of propaganda through the perspective of a child, it seems like this alone is the only reason why there are some who hold it in such a high regard. It is still a make believe representation. Ordinarily this is fine but for those who are inevitably gullible enough to take this satire as an accurate account of Nazi Germany I think it is potentially dangerous for it to play at devils advocate.The tonal mish-mash between comedic and tragic seems, I think misguided and isn't particularly funny given the subject matter. There was the odd bit of amusement but generally the story was quite dull, meandering unless your perspective is clouded by an idealisation of children's 'ways of knowing', to paraphrase the postmodern mindset.",3,8,13,29 March 2020
Deadpool," Tries pathetically hard to be 'edgy' & 'sexy.' Overhyped Garbage.
","Tries so hard to be funny by using purile and dirty humour that is actually pretty sexist in a machismo kind of way. I presume that one reason this film is so popular just because Deadpool is pansexual, because it's so wonderful and 'sexy' in the trendsetting banalities framework of the films like this rather than just being treated like a sexuality like any other. Another reason I hate this film is because it is being touted as though it is edgy and brilliant. Just because, what? There's a load of meaningless gore and sexual references? God, they must live sheltered lives with little juvenile minds. To call this film one big exercise in juvenility would be an insult to young people. Patronising would probably be better.",1,1,3,21 July 2018
Her," Plays on the comic book styled media hype of 'sentient' robots.
","'Her' is largely a film that builds on older films that contain the somewhat patronising subtext: 'This is where technology will bring us in our brave new future.' The film is fairly interesting, yet it appears to legitimise people's obsession with technology by romanticising it. In the case, this romanticisation is quite literal due to the fact that the main character develops what deceptively passes as a 'relationship' with an AI. There really is little to say about this film, except it serves as a depressing reminder that people would prefer talking to a piece of software rather than other human beings. However, I'm sure that the more pretentious and irrationally romantic among us would probably herald the film as a touching and poignant polyromantic story that is the future of 'THE WORLD OF TOMORROW!'",4,0,0,25 July 2018
