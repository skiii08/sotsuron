The Ring," nah too confusin!!!
","I thought this movie waas good up until the last 10min or so. The story was really great up until there, but the ending made no sense at all. Like if the people that saw the tape had to make copies in order to save themselves thats really stupid coz who else is gonna see the tape?? At the end since the lil boy copied it too theres two copies but wouldnt it make sense to destroy the tapes or hide them so no one else can see them...so then no one else would die?? I just dont get the ending. Its like they couldnt think of a good way to end it and threw in some randomness instead. I feel like i've wasted an hour and a half. Although the imagery was really good and some scenes really were very freaky, but other than that the story was worth nothing.",Null,0,1,8 July 2003
