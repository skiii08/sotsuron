The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay Part 1 doesn't feel like a complete movie and fails to reach the heights of its predecessors
","After the huge success of two Hunger Games movies, it was announced that Mockingjay would be split in two parts. The film picks up after the events of Catching Fire, where the story continued with Katniss, our reluctant heroine from District 12 finally becomes the titular head of a growing rebellion against the Capitol through a series of propaganda videos. This time, the film is lesser on the action, explosions or heavy violence and chooses to focus on being a political drama that takes the themes of war and revolution to the next level instead.The Hunger Games has always been a character-driven story filled with meaningful themes by exploring real-world issues about rebellion, politics, conflicts, war, survival that ultimately stands out among the other Young Adult franchises. Katniss' several acts of defiance against the fascist Capitol government during the Hunger Games in the first two films have finally fan the flames of rebellion among the districts of Panem to take back their nation. While the country is on the verge of war, Katniss must also try to find a way to rescue Peeta and the rest of the tributes, who have been taken hostages, tortured and imprisoned by the Capitol.Throughout the years, the franchise has done a great job in showing us that Katniss is truly the Mockingjay - the symbol of hope and rebellion in Panem. The books are written in Katniss' point of view, but the movies have made the effort of showing us other events largely unseen by her to allow us to gain a better understanding of the events that are happening in the film, such as the political meetings or discussions of President Snow or the control room of the games in past films. Mockingjay Part 1 takes time to give us a closer look at the beginnings of war by showing us some details about the uprisings that are taking place in other districts. From the brutal public executions, aerial bombing of cities and threatening speeches by President Snow himself, people are suffering and dying. The film also shows how easily people can be manipulated by media, by showing us that the people of Panem (Capitol and all the other districts) are easily influenced by what they see and hear, especially on TV. However, the ways the Capitol uses media to control all of Panem, it also shows that the rebels can use the same strategy to fight back as well. Both sides is using propaganda as a form of psychological warfare.The film essentially tries to tell the audience that there are no perfect governments or political systems. Political ideologies always fail in reality because of the greed of men who only seek wealth or power. In Mockingjay Part 1, we see how Katniss is being used by the rebel leaders to fight the war. There's even one particular scene where Peeta asks Katniss whether she truly knows the people she's working for, letting us in doubt whether the rebels of District 13 are fighting for the right cause or it's just another Capitol in the making. Once again, Jennifer Lawrence pulls another strong performance as Katniss as she's the one who gets the most character development in this film. With Peeta captured by the Capitol for the entire film, Liam Hemsworth gets more screen time this time for his character, Gale after being left out of the story in the first two films. The film also introduces new characters, especially District 13's rebel leader, President Coin who will soon becomes one of the antagonist that Katniss need to face in Part 2. Elizabeth Banks' character, Effie serves as comic relief this time around, but her character also shows that not all people in the Capitol are vain and oppressive as we think they are.However, Mockingjay Part 1 doesn't feel like a complete movie and fails to reach the heights of its predecessors. It's the first half of the final book adapted to film, which doesn't really provide any conclusions, it doesn't feel like it has a self-contained plot as none of the character arcs are fully resolved. The film keeps on setting the necessary pieces for the final epic showdown between the districts and Capitol but there's nothing significant happening throughout the film as all the relevant plot twists, the actual fight is in part 2. The film spends most of its time to show us the beginnings of war but couldn't provide further details on why the rebels in District 13 have so many resources and doesn't look malnourished compared with people from other districts. In my opinion, it felt unnecessary to split the final chapter into two parts as many of the scenes actually hurts the pace of the movie. It could be a far better film with a run time of probably 3 hours or so. We are all excited for the story's conclusion and yet we were asked to be patient and wait for next year's Part 2 instead. As the credits roll, I find myself leaving the cinema asking, that's it?Rating: 7/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-hunger-games- mockingjay.html",7,8,22,25 November 2014
Captain Phillips," A detailed and realistic hijack-survival film I've ever seen
","Based on the book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea' written by Captain Richard Phillips, the film Captain Phillips tells the story of MV Maersk Alabama hijacking incident, which involves the captain's capture and hostage-taking by four Somali pirates in April 2009.Although the film may be inaccurate (some of the crew members of the ship accused the film of being inaccurate in facts and does not tell the true story), but it's the most detailed and realistic hijack-survival films I've ever seen. The film successfully shows the constant struggle for survival in a life-or-death situation.As usual, Tom Hanks delivers one of his best performances in this film, after realizing that the pirates are just poor and desperate Somali fishermen, he feels despair of his failure to convince them to surrender after knowing the inevitable fate awaiting his captors. In the emotional final scene, I find myself in tears during Hanks' powerful portrayal of a man experiencing post-traumatic stress. However, the story is predictable, progressively slow and takes some time to build up to its climax. The details of the hijacking and subsequent hostage taking feels overly long and might put off a lot of audience. The shaky-cam technique, which is typically used in most Paul Greengrass' films in an attempt to make the film more realistic doesn't help much...even making it worst at times and hurt the film.Overall, it's not the greatest drama film ever made, but it's worth a watch to those who want a realistic, detailed, emotional drama which is 'based on a true story' (we can never know how true it is, are we?). It's not for those who seeks simple hardcore Hollywood action entertainment (otherwise you'll be disappointed).",8,0,2,7 December 2013
The Equalizer," A thrilling, entertaining action thriller that's comparable or better than Taken
","'...Brick by brick, dollar by dollar, body by body, I promised I wouldn't go back to being that person...But for you, I'm going to make an exception...' This is what Denzel, being an absolute badass, says that to his enemy in a key scene of the film. Just when you think Liam Neeson was great as a lone-wolf action hero in Taken (2008), here comes Denzel Washington, upping the ante as McCall, the Equalizer. Yeah, I was completely sold by his performance.Based on the 1985 TV series of the same name, Denzel stars as McCall, a retired man with a shady past, armed with a formidable set of skills like no other, chose to work at a Home Depot hardware store and lives a quiet, peaceful life. However, he soon discovers all the injustice that are happening around the neighbourhood and decides to take matters into his own hands to 'equalize' the situation by helping the helpless.First and foremost, I couldn't provide any comparisons with the old TV series as I've never watched any of the episodes before. Similar to Taken (2008) or Man On Fire (2004), I don't deny the fact that the film has a preposterous premise. One guy against the entire mob? Seriously? However, despite its silliness, Denzel Washington - a two-time Academy Award winner with numerous bad-ass roles in the past such as Man on Fire (2004), The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009), The Book of Eli (2010) and Unstoppable (2010), managed to deliver a strong, convincing performance with some very catchy, powerful punchlines that actually makes the viewers believe that he's the guy who is really capable of taking down the entire Russian mafia on his own. He owns the character and makes the character come to life on screen.Aside from that, we get to know him just from his expressions when his personal background is briefly mentioned in the film. Although the film relies on a few plot contrivances for it to work (typical issue for most action thrillers) and it also includes the much overused 'walk-away' explosion scene again, but Denzel just look so bad-ass whenever he fights on screen that I willing to overlook some of its flaws.On the other hand, Marton Csokas did a great job in his portrayal of Teddy/Nikolai, the intimidating and menacing Russian mob fixer who's sent by the mob to deal with the situation. There's one particular disturbing scene in which he slowly circles a terror-stricken prostitute while comforting and reassuring her that it's going to be okay before leading her to an inevitable fate. ChloÃ« Grace Moretz did a fine job as Teri as well. It's such a shame that she was taken off screen rather early in the film, only to reappear again in the final moments.The film gives a satisfying climax and the action is well choreographed. Another notable mention is that the film contains a lot of bloody and gory violence. If some viewers feel uncomfortable with on-screen gruesome violent fights, then in that case it's probably not advisable to watch this film. However, please keep in mind that these people (the mafia characters the actors portrayed) are not considered as humans, but merciless scumbags. They treat women as nothing other than sexual objects for money, willing to kill anyone without hesitation or remorse, thinking they're high and mighty and forcibly exert authority and influence over others. In the film, McCall gave them a choice beforehand, but they choose to belittle him instead. So, violence was necessary and they've got exactly what they deserve. To be honest, I don't feel sorry for them at all.Overall, the film exceeds all my expectations. The film delivers, in spades. I expect Denzel Washington to kick some criminal ass and I've gotten more than I bargained for. Gruesome and brutal, but highly rewarding. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Highly recommended!

Iron Man 3," An entertaining superhero film that surpassed its predecessors
","Iron Man 3 is a fast-paced, entertaining sci-fi action thriller that turned out better than its disappointing predecessor. This time around, there's no distracting Avengers subplot and the main focus goes to the main character instead. Once again, Robert Downey Jr. is at his best and fits his role perfectly as the arrogant, smart-ass Tony Stark by delivering sharp witty dialogue that make the film downright hilarious. Great round of applause for the people who's responsible for thinking up the various ways Tony can put on the suits in the film, well done!However, the film crossed the borderline of science fiction and science fantasy. There are things in the film that's simply could not happen in reality under any circumstances, which some movie-goers might find it hard to accept. As a person who knows the cartoon and comics, the direction the film took for the characters and the 'Extremis' story arc is questionable. Some Marvel fans/purists will find it unacceptable, but for casual movie-goers, the plot is great and it's really a personal story about the titular hero. Iron Man 3 showed that it's not just a superhero film, but a smart comedy film as well. So, in the end, does the suit make the man or does the man make the suit? Well, you damn well know what the answer is after finish watching this film.",8,89,170,25 April 2013
Gravity," A sci-fi visual spectacle that shouldn't be missed
","Gravity is truly a visually stunning sci-fi thriller about two people (a medical engineer and an astronaut) trying to survive after an unexpected accident leaves them adrift in space. The story is simple, straightforward and predictable, the entire film happens in space and there's only 2 actors you'll be seeing throughout the film.However, the visual aspects of the film are aesthetically breathtaking and realistic at the same time. The visuals showing Earth or even aurora borealis is truly mesmerizing. It successfully captures the terrifying dangers a person might experience while in space to the audience. In space, it's downright scary when all communication systems down, no oxygen, no gravity, with extreme cold temperatures, no sound where no one can hear you scream, no one can help you and you're all alone. Moreover, Clooney managed to provide enough charm and Bullock's character has a likable personality for the audience to continue watching the film and hope that they manage to survive their ordeal.The film also provides us some of the character's visual perspectives - out-of-body floating and spinning experience, explosions due to objects flying and colliding with each other in space without sound...I believe this is as close as you can get to have a decent space experience in the cinema.As Bullock's character said in the film, it's truly one hell of a ride.Recommended to watch it in 3D. (although 2D is still acceptable if you're in a tight budget) http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/10/movie-review-gravity.html Rating: 8.5/10",8,2,6,4 October 2013
The Maze Runner," A great suspenseful and thrilling first and second act, but a disappointing third act revelation
","The Maze Runner is another Young-Adult book-to-film adaptation that offers a great deal of suspense, mystery and excitement with many lives are at stake. The film asks us which is the better choice â choosing to stay in our own personal comfort zone where we feel safe or we brave enough to take a leap of faith to face the unknown and search for a better path. It essentially encourages us to dare to be different in a world that wants us to conform...we should continue to expand and push ourselves to do more. Without knowing anything about the book, The Maze Runner does feels familiar in some ways and it gives the feeling that we have all seen this before (very similar to The Hunger Games, Divergent or The Giver).Based on the novel of the same name by James Dashner, The Maze Runner is about a group of young teenagers or kids who are trapped in a place called The Glade, the center of a giant maze, without any memories of their previous lives. Every month, each and every one of them wakes up in a caged elevator that comes with supplies. Some of them have been there for years and they've set up some ground rules that everyone must abide in order to live harmoniously and co-exist peacefully together. The Glade is surrounded by huge walls that only has one opening that leads to the giant maze and it closes every night. In order to escape, they send out runners to explore the maze in order to find a way out. However, there are mysterious, dangerous creatures called the 'Grievers' that come out at night to hunt for food and the runners must ensure that they're back before the maze closes every night. The runners have been doing that for years, but still unable to find a way out, until Thomas appears.As with many other Young-Adult protagonists (similar to Katniss in The Hunger Games, Tris in Divergent, Jonas in The Giver), Thomas is different from the rest. He's curious, questioning everything around him and willing to do whatever it takes to seek and find answers. Not to mention, he's brave enough to lead the Gladers to conquer the maze. We're also introduced to Gally, another similar antagonist that doesn't like change, who wants everyone to strictly abide by the rules so that everyone can co-exist peacefully.The first act of the movie is incredibly promising, compelling and suspenseful enough to keep viewers interested, with enough drama, mystery and tension building up in the second act. However, everything goes downhill as soon as the third act begins. The revelation in the third act is considered a huge letdown considering the thrilling, suspenseful set-up earlier in the film. Who is Thomas? Why he's the most 'promising' of them all? Who sent him here? Why 'they' sent Thomas and Teresa? What is The Maze? Why they're all trapped in the Maze? What are the 'Grievers' actually? How on earth that guy (I won't spoil it for you) managed to escape and meet them at the end? The explanations are vague...the film doesn't provide clear answers for many of the questions poised earlier in the film at its conclusion and relies on the next sequel to answer them instead (some of them I highly doubt so).Furthermore, the film never takes the time to explore its characters further and makes you care about them. The actors were convincing in their roles by providing decent performances but none of them were outstanding enough to make a deep impression. The friendship and camaraderie between the Gladers are shown throughout the film, but less profound. The only girl in the Glade, Teresa, lacks screen time and she serves no purpose for being in the film. You won't feel anything missing if she's completely removed from the story, because her role doesn't seemed to affect the overall plot of the film (there's enough suspense in the connection between Thomas and Teresa but that's not fully answered at the end of the film, so the only way to explain her inclusion in the film is probably that she's an important character in future instalments). The development of the characters felt rushed and truth be told, I didn't feel any emotional connection to the characters at all.Moreover, there are no memorable moments or impressive action in the entire film. As soon as the 'Grievers' appear on-screen, all you see are just a bunch of closeups, fast cuts and blurred, shaky action. For me, it is hard to tell what is going on most of the time. Overall, The Maze Runner is suspenseful and exciting at the beginning, but it fails to deliver a dramatic and satisfying pay-off to the audience after all the patient waiting in hope to finally see everything comes together in the end.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-maze-runner.html Rating: 6.5/10",6,5,20,17 September 2014
This Is the End," Not your typical comedy film
","This is The End is an out of an ordinary celebrity apocalypse comedy film. The story is quite simple: A bunch of Hollywood actors and actresses are having a party but suddenly the world comes to an end and the survivors fight to stay alive. We get to see a lot of cameos from actors playing themselves throughout the film: Cera, Segel, Tatum, Watson, Mintz-Plasse, Rudd, Rihanna,etc.While the whole concept of the film is new and interesting, but the execution is weak. None of the 'characters' are likable or memorable...Most of them are douchebags or pricks. While the film is not terrible and still watchable (I suppose), but it doesn't feel funny from beginning to end. The jokes presented in the film were crude and raunchy (a lot of dick, masturbation jokes) which may not be everyone's cup of tea. There's some gory death scenes (you get to see various Hollywood stars getting killed), a lengthy conversation about who is going to rape Watson, Rogen urinating into his own mouth, to name a few...There's a lot of sudden, unexpected events that may come as a surprise to the audience. Many who assumed that this is a silly comedy that shouldn't be treated seriously could easily change their mind after watching it. The demons shown in the film are genuinely scary looking and a demon-possessed Jonah Hill look quite disturbing in the film as well.Overall, this film is mixed bag...For those who enjoyed the stars' previous works might find it acceptable or entertaining to watch, but for the rest, I don't really think so. Personally, I expected more, considering the film is filled with talented comedy actors, but what to do?",6,8,18,21 September 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," A great sci-fi action adventure that shouldn't be missed!!
","Star Trek Into Darkness is a blast to watch that's filled with spectacular visuals, fast-paced action sequences, plot twists and emotional moments. There's one particular scene between Spock and Kirk, actually brought me to tears. It's fun to watch the occasionally humorous character interactions that eventually further develops the relationships between the crew members in the film.(especially the 'logic VS impulsiveness' arguments between Spock & Kirk and Scotty as well) However, many Trekkie fans might be disappointed and possibly say it's another alternate retelling of Wrath of Khan. (the best film of the old Star Trek series) But for most casual moviegoers, it is one of the best films this year has to offer, possibly the best sci-fi action adventure of the year. Once again, it is proved that with a smart script, great actors, solid plot and good direction will certainly produce great films that exceed expectations.",8,6,17,11 May 2013
About Time," a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart
","From the director of 'Love Actually', who is also the writer of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Bean', 'Notting Hill' and the 'Bridget Jones' films, it sure raises some expectations for this particular fantasy romantic comedy drama film about time travel. Although it shares some similarities with 'The Time Traveler's Wife' (the same female lead actress, Rachel McAdams) and 'Groundhog Day', but rest assured, 'About Time' is a witty, intelligent, charming, sweet film with surprising depth and heart. The script was well written, the direction was great and the casts made a decent performance in their respective roles. The film done a fine job in balancing the comedic and dramatic elements of the story, providing enough laughter and allowing it to flow smoothly without feeling too overly long despite its 2 hours running time.Despite the time-traveling plot device, the story focuses on the father-son relationship of Tim and his dad and the lovely romantic relationship between Tim and Mary, without being too sappy, too overly lovey-dovey or too sentimental. The message or overall theme of the film about appreciating life as if it was your last was subtle and not too forceful or preachy.The selection of songs for the film was appropriate and not too overly done for the emotional scenes.The on-screen chemistry between Rachel and Domhnall are convincing enough for the audience to watch them going through life together. On the other hand, Domhnall and Bill, as father and son, their connection is felt throughout the film and certainly evoke some poignant memories when watching them together.It's one of the best romantic comedies this year had to offer, better than the disappointing 'Time Traveler's Wife'. It's a great date movie that's not to be missed.",8,294,340,21 September 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller.
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the third film in Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (after last year's Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World). Compared with the mighty giant green monster, the hammer wielding Norse thunder god or the 'genius, philanthropist, billionaire, playboy' armor man, the Captain was never quite as appealing as the rest of the 'Unusuals'. Steve Rogers is portrayed as an old-fashioned, straightforward, honest, courageous, sincere, patriotic superhero. This makes him a less-interesting, boring character. Moreover, as Tony Stark said it, 'Everything special about you came out of a bottle!'Most film-goers would know that Marvel films are famous for its bright, fun and not-so-serious approach to its storytelling, together with some catchy, witty dialogues. This film is a game changer in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This time around, Marvel decided to take a different approach on things: To make a Captain America sequel with a more serious, darker plot development and more face-to-face close-range hand combat fights. What should have been a typical superhero film, now becomes a conspiracy-espionage thriller.Two years after the events that happened in New York city, the Captain still struggles with adjusting himself to the modern world, with no apparent social life or girl friend, which is why Natasha/Black Widow tries to introduce or recommend him some cute girls in S.H.I.E.L.D. for him to date with. He is shocked when he learns that the very governmental organisation he is working for is not what it seems to be, as the Cap said in the trailer, 'This isn't freedom. This is fear'. Soon, he finds himself entangled in a conspiracy that puts millions of innocent lives at risk.The film comes with excellent, fast-paced action choreography. Although the cinematography is a bit dodgy due to the shaky-cam techniques used for depicting the chaotic moments, the fight scenes between the Winter Soldier and the Captain is fantastic and serves as one of the film's highlights. The audience finally gets to see how the Captain's shield is utilised effectively in both offensive and defensive combat situations. It also good to see again how Natasha kicks ass in the film.All actors delivered a pretty decent performance in the film. Once again, Chris Evans and Scarlett Johannson both proved that they fit their roles well, adding more depth to the characters they portray in the film. Sam Wilson/Falcon is a welcome addition to the Marvel franchise and hopefully he will appear again in the Avengers sequel. Unfortunately, despite the film's title, the winter soldier is not a complex villain and doesn't appear much in the film. It's such a shame to just show him as a formidable physical fighter who's capable of challenging the Captain.The film is well-scripted, filled with suspense while highlighting some important socio-political issues such as government surveillance and control in its storytelling. Although the twists in the film is predictable and fairly easy to guess, the sequel is a marked improvement compared to its predecessor, Captain America: The First Avenger. The story unfolds gradually and comes with huge, surprising developments by the end of the film. Marvel Cinematic Universe is not going to be the same again. What's going to happen next? How the story is going to progress in Avengers: Age of Ultron, after what had happened in this film? Interesting.Rating: 8.5/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-captain-america- winter.htmlBe warned. This is not the typical fun, 'not-so-serious', entertaining Marvel film that you used to watch in the past. You might like it or find it a bore. In order to recognize some of the characters in the film, you need to remember some of Marvel's Phase One films. Most importantly, you need to watch Captain America: The First Avenger before watching this to understand the plot.Note: Guess you don't need me to remind you to stay for the mid-credit and post-credit scenes. It foreshadows what's going to happen next by introducing a lesser-known supervillain and two new characters, 'Miracles' (another name for 'mutants' because of screen rights issues) which going to be in the Avengers sequel, Age of Ultron. It further confirms that one of weapons depicted in The Avengers is indeed one of the six infinity stones.",8,164,256,27 March 2014
Interstellar," Nolan's most ambitious sci-fi action drama adventure thriller
","These days, few filmmakers dare to reach high enough to challenge our minds and continuously put us on the edge of our seats every time. From the backwards narrative structure of Memento, the illusionary gripping Prestige, the socio-political Dark Knight Trilogy, the dream heist Inception that offers layers of dreaming consciousness, Nolan never ceases to deliver one thought-provoking film after another.This time around, the Nolans (script was written by both brothers) decided take us into the farthest mysteries of space-time by exploring matters of theoretical physics, to inspire us to venture out to the unknown, to reach for the skies. Most importantly, to encourage space exploration, specifically interstellar travel for the survival of our species. Before the release of the film, expectations were high with Interstellar being touted as the most highly anticipated sci-fi film of the year.It should be no surprise that Interstellar offers another mind- challenging movie-going experience for the audience. Despite its long running time, the film is thoroughly engaging with its jaw- dropping, astounding plot twists (especially with its overambitious third act) and foreshadowing that heightens the suspense in the film. Furthermore, Nolan adds more depth to the film's main premise with some thought-provoking matters such as importance of time, personal interests vs global necessity (is it worthy to sacrifice the time with our children when the survival of our species is at risk?) through a simple father-daughter relationship story, watching the characters as they face the reality of a universe that's far bigger than them.The film questions what things in life that really matter to us, to explore and see the world in a larger picture with our limited lifespan. Despite the seriousness and dramatic tension in the film, there are some occasionally funny scenes through the interaction between the human characters and the intelligent yet sarcastic robots, TARS and CASE.Interstellar is as spectacular as Nolan's previous films, by showing us the wonder of space beyond our imagination. Interstellar delivers in terms of spectacle and they're all breathtaking to look at, from Saturn's giant rings, the 4-th dimensional space when a spacecraft enters a wormhole, the exploration of two different planets, the stunning rendition of a spinning black hole and the possibility of extra-dimensional space. All of them are explored in ways that makes me admire the movie very much and I personally respect the director's attempt in showing us these things. Interstellar is considered to be Nolan's most ambitious film to date.However, it seems that Nolan's reach finally exceeds his grasp. Unfortunately, Interstellar isn't as accessible as Nolan's previous movies due to its dense scientific theories. The general audience might find the theoretical physics presented in the film too hard to understand. Its attempt to tackle some of the complicated theoretical physics concepts and philosophical ideas seemed to be rather heavy-handed this time around, especially the film's extremely audacious last act.The film is filled with scientific jargon (space-time dimensions, relativity, time dilation, quantum gravity, gravitational singularity, event horizon, etc) and this could leave certain audience feeling completely underwhelmed. Moreover, the exposition- heavy dialogues feels like characters delivering science lessons to each other. I do understand that exposition is a necessity in science fiction (to spoon-feed the audience with knowledge on science so that we know what's going on) but it's just doesn't feel natural in certain scenes this time around, perhaps this is due to the complexity nature of the scientific concepts presented in the film. Don't get me wrong, the film is great and succeeds intellectually on many levels, but only a handful of audience are capable of understanding it.The film greatest strength lies on its underlying scientific concepts and intriguing plot, but not its characters (with the exception of McConaughey's character). All the enlisted casts are considered to be Hollywood's most talented actors but the film underdevelops the relationships between its characters as science takes a lead role in the story. Despite stellar performances from each of the casts, none of the supporting characters are particularly memorable as their roles aren't well-realised as intended. Many of the characters have very little depth, due to the limited screen time and the need to explain heavy-handed scientific concepts to the audience. Even though Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Sir Michael Caine and Matt Damon each have their own moments, that's just not enough to provide a deep memorable impression to the audience.The heart of Interstellar lies with the bond between the father (Cooper, Matthew McConaughey's character) and his daughter (Murph, Mackenzie Foy's/Jessica Chastain's character) and McConaughey managed to provide a stand-out performance as a strong, likable and relatable yet conflicted lead character: on one hand, he needs to reach for the stars and beyond to save humanity, while the other never wanting to let go of his family. There's a scene in the film where Cooper sheds tears of love and despair while watching 23 years of video messages left by his son back on Earth due to time dilation effect is particularly heartbreaking and would certainly evoke an emotional response from the audience.Overall, Nolan succeeded in taking various complex theoretical physics concepts and use them all together to make a tightly woven story, which is a remarkable feat. Despite its flaws, Interstellar is still an engaging watch and one hell of a journey getting to the end.Rating: 8/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-interstellar.html",8,2,7,9 November 2014
Pacific Rim," the most entertaining live-action mecha VS kaiju film to date
","Pacific Rim is the most entertaining live-action mecha VS kaiju film to date. The premise is simple and unpretentious. The film honours the origins of the genre, it doesn't try to be something else and delivers on its promise. The fight between Kaiju and Jaegers are clear clean-shot action sequences, no shaky-cam, extreme zoom-ins, 360 shots or first person viewing that would make many audience uncomfortable.The action is beautifully choreographed, executed with style and magnificence.Ignore the critics' comments that the monsters or mecha shown in the film is unclear or not visible because most of the fight scenes happen at night, in the rain or underwater...because they're totally unjustified. I can clearly see them. Although no in-depth character development is provided for all of the supporting characters and there are some character issues in the film (some characters seemed to be 'specifically engineered' to serve a purpose), but the characterisation provided is sufficient enough for the audience to know them and justify their actions in the film.The film didn't try to be overly serious, a pair of mismatched scientists is included to provide some comic relief.There're some plotting issues where the prologue that serves as the backstory of the war is too fast-paced and we're only shown a glimpse of the Kaiju's first contact to humanity. There's a flashback scene worth mentioning, the little girl who plays the young Mako is extremely adorable and her expressions managed to convince the audience about her traumatic experience.If your childhood memories consists of Transformers, Evangelion, Mobile Suit Gundam, Godzilla, Ultraman...So why not give Pacific Rim a chance?

American Hustle," An overly long, draggy dialogue-heavy film despite stellar performances from its casts
","American Hustle is a loose retelling (as stated at the beginning of the film, 'some of this actually happened.') of the FBI ABSCAM operation of the late 1970s that led to a few bribery convictions which involved a U.S. senator, six members of the House of Representatives, a State Senate, members of the Philadelphia City Council, the Mayor of Camden, New Jersey, and an inspector for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.The story is about two con-artists, Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) who was forced to cooperate with an FBI agent, Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) to arrest 4 high-flying con artists so they can be pardoned from their crimes. However, what initially seems to be an operation that targets stolen property trafficking eventually lead to a huge, elaborate public corruption investigation, which goes out of control and involved the mafia as well.Sounds interesting? It seems so, on paper. In film, to commit a con job normally requires heavy exposition, to explain the elaborate plan without failing to engage the audience along the way. The film failed at doing that.Despite its unexpected plot twist, the film suffers heavily due to its pacing and length. It's overly long and filled with constant, ceaseless dialogue-heavy scenes, with literally no action to provide the thrill factor, which most general audience will find it to be boring. It's all talking, talking, and talking. Acting, acting, and acting. It goes on and on...The film drags too long until when something unusual happens (the point where the operation starts to go beyond control), it's a little too late as many would have lose interest by then (fortunately not me, but quite close though).Most of the actors done their utmost best, delivering their award- worthy, charming performance to the film, which is mostly the reason why the film received such critical acclaim upon its release. But, don't believe the hype. This film was no better than any of the other Oscar award-nominated films of 2013. The film does provide a few occasional laughs here and there, there's some witty dialogue delivered perfectly by actors on-screen, but that's it.Overall, it's not a bad film, it's just not a solid entertainment and not nearly as much fun as you would expect it to be. It would certainly benefit the film if the director is willing to cut some of the unnecessary scenes in film.Rating: 7/10 http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-american-hustle.html",7,0,2,16 March 2014
Rush," A great F1 biopic drama
","Rush is a biopic drama based on the real-life rivalry between the famous Formula One drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1976 Formula One season. First and foremost, I'm not a Formula 1 fan as I find the sport uninteresting and I don't know much about the sport itself.But, I find myself drawn into this film.Different than many typical racing sports film found out there, Rush actually shows the clash between two distinctive, contrasting personalities, the passion that brought them into the sport and fears that come with it. James Hunt is a highly sociable British playboy who loves to live life dangerously close to death, have the willingness to do whatever it takes to win, a seemingly typical F1 driver. On the other hand, Niki Lauda is an eccentric, methodical, disciplined, and seemingly unsociable perfectionist, constantly assessing the odds and potential risks and outcome of things.Watching these two characters constantly pushing their limits to be the world's best racer and what drives them to win truly makes this a very engaging, entertaining, interesting drama to watch.With a great character-driven script by Peter Morgan, brilliant direction by Ron Howard, good acting performances by the two leads to provide impressive character depth and gripping, intense score composed by Han Zimmer (again), the film successfully showed both personas, allowing the audience to draw out the differences between these two men, in terms of personal values and beliefs and how they eventually develop mutual respect for the other by the end of the film.Technically speaking, it seems like Lauda is the better driver as he knows the specifics, modification, requirements of a Formula 1 car compared to James, but James' bold and determined personality also shows that he's a good driver who certainly deserves respect.The racing scenes in the film was intense and beautifully filmed. The injuries sustained by Lauda during the Nurburging crash in 1976 looks about the same in real-life. It's definitely a compelling drama worth watching, not to be missed.Rating: 8.5/10 'When I saw it the first time I was impressed. There was no Hollywood changes or things changed a little bit Hollywood-like. It is very accurate. And this really surprised me very positively.' -Niki Lauda (Carjam TV Interview, September, 2013) http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/10/movie-review-rush.html",8,2,3,5 October 2013
Man of Steel," A long awaited Superman film that delivers
","Man of Steel, similar to Batman Begins, is a serious, realistic, visually stunning, modernized take on Superman and his origins for the new generation, which is a solid step in the right direction for the character.This is the second Superman film in 25 years, as there hasn't been a Superman movie since 2006 (Superman Returns) and before that, not since 1987. Safely to say, this is the Superman film most DC fans have been waiting for.A straightforward, character-driven story about a boy, who was not born of this world, who had the power to change the world, being taught by his protective adopted parents to limit himself, pressured to control his powers along with his emotions and use them responsibly since young - to not be so fast, not be so strong, not be so powerful, in fear that he will hurt others or even himself. As a result of that, psychologically, he's afraid of himself, feel isolated and alone, self-doubt, being ashamed of what he's truly capable of. On the other hand, his biological parents see his son's potential to be the symbol of hope for all mankind - a source of inspiration and goodness, and not fall into the same footsteps as them (Kryptonians). It's amazing to witness again the character's transformation, from a person who was unable to accept who he was...to someone who finally accepts his destiny, to accomplish things so legendary that his name in the future will be known throughout the universe. This is what most fans had been waiting for ages - to see a realistic modern age superman that 'can' exist in the real world. A story that truly defines Superman's modern age persona, his core essence - searching and understanding his purpose for being here on Earth...Another rare comic book film which deals with some profound questions, ideas, perspectives and makes us think.All the actors and actresses deliver their best performances for the film(heck, what do you expect?...some of them are either Oscar winners or nominees).Most of the film critics made a huge mistake for comparing Donner's version of Superman (which is loosely based on the Golden and Silver age of comic book history of the character), with this new take of Superman (which is loosely based on the Modern age of comic book history).Although the character's core essence may be roughly similar to each other, but they are not identical. It is worth noting that all of the special effect sequences in the film, combined with Han Zimmer's epic scores are superb and managed to keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the film - the scenes where Clark soars through the sky, breaking the sound barrier...the sheer scale of the fights between the Kryptonians...etc, simply fits how a Superman should be portrayed on the big screen.It shows that the filmmakers have a perfect understanding of Superman's powers and abilities.The weakest aspect of this movie is the Lois/Superman relationship. Since the movie is too focused on Superman, the relationship between Superman and Lois felt a little rushed and underdeveloped.The on-screen chemistry between them is simply not convincing enough to be believable. Many of the supporting characters are not fully developed (Perry White, Jimmy Olsen,Dr. Hamilton...) as a consequence of fitting in more epic, jaw-dropping action sequences.I'm not particularly fond of the gloomy outlook/darker atmosphere that surrounds the entire movie (the choice of using dark muted colors and high contrast for the film,Possibly to make the special effects looked more realistic I suppose), it's acceptable...But, I wished they could have brighten up the colors in the next sequel. The non-linear story-telling worked well, the film never drags and it managed to transition effectively from current time to flashbacks as we see the character is slowly developed. But, there's a drawback to this as it occasionally hurts the flow and pacing of the story as well. Overall, it's astounding, epic, spectacular. It's the most anticipated movie of the year and it delivers. This new cinematic take on Superman is a worthy interpretation of the 75 year old icon.(The character was created in 1938).Many thanks to writer David Goyer and director Zack Snyder for bringing back Superman his long-lost coolness, re-establish him in today's modern world. The origin depicted in the film will let people have a better understanding of who Superman is. Finally, the people know what the 'S' symbol stands for - the symbol of the House of El and Hope. From now on, no one will ever think of Superman the same way again. Finally, the man of steel reclaims his title as the world's greatest superhero.Now, just as Man of Steel is to Batman Begins, I'm extremely hopeful for a groundbreaking, phenomenal sequel that transcends the superhero genre to become one of the best films of the decade...much like The Dark Knight, for the Man of Tomorrow.Rating: 7.5/10'You were sent here for a reason...and even if it takes the rest of your life, you owe it to yourself to find out what that reason is...You just have to decide what kind of man you want to grow up to be, Clark. Whoever that man is, he's going to change the world...' - Jonathan Kent'You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards. They'll race behind you. They'll stumble. They'll fall. But, in time, they'll join you in the sun. In time, you'll help them accomplish wonders.' - Jor El",8,15,30,13 June 2013
We're the Millers," A surprisingly enjoyable family comedy
","We're the Millers is one of the entertaining, enjoyable, not-so-serious, formulaic but better comedy films out this year. (better than the abysmal Hangover 3) The story is simple: a drug dealer, a stripper, a troubled runaway and a virgin disguise as a fake happy family (on the assumption they will not get caught) on a road trip to Mexico to smuggle few tons of marijuana to the states. The film features a lot of amusing episodic misadventures during the journey (a ridiculous series of plot contrivances moves the film along), with consistent bickering (due to different backgrounds for each of the characters) and the eventual sentimental bonding between them.Despite the simplicity the plot, the film is well-acted and uplifted by a group of talented actors who tried their best to make it an entertaining film.It managed to offer some occasional laughs and smiles to the audience while feeling relaxed throughout the film.If you don't take it too seriously, lighten up and don't pick on the details of the film, you will find this family comedy enjoyable and worth the ride.The outtakes at the end of the film were quite good and fun to watch, especially a family sing-along scene in the van where they played 'I'll Be There For You' (from F.R.I.E.N.D.S.), teasing Jennifer Aniston, from which she responds after smiling embarrassingly, 'That was very good. Very funny.' Jennifer acted in the famous sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S., which is one of my favorite sitcom shows ever.",7,1,3,1 September 2013
Divergent," A surprisingly good YA sci-fi action drama thriller adaptation
","After the tremendous success of Twilight, Harry Potter and Hunger Games series, Hollywood film studios have made several attempts to repeat the success. But, many have failed to capture the hearts of fans and general audience alike. Now, here comes another young adult sci-fi action drama thriller series...The Divergent Trilogy. Will it succeed and remembered as one of the good young adult series? Time will tell.Adapted from Veronica Roth's first book, it is a story about the conflict between individuality and social conformity...the dilemma of being different, not fitting in with the society and the fears that comes with it. It raises the question on why people in general, submit to social conformity (obedience and unwillingness to change), without any resistance. Is it really deeply rooted in our genes? Why individualists are mostly frown upon by society and feared by the authorities?The film offers an interesting world with strong characters, an engaging plot enough to captivate the audience for its long running time (140 minutes). In a post-apocalyptic Chicago, the people are divided into a five-faction social system, enforced by the authorities to maintain peace and order after an unspecified catastrophic war, based on their primary distinct personalities: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (kindness), Candor (honesty), Erudite (intelligence) and Dauntless (courage). The film starts out with the lead female character questions her place in society, but later on, she starts to question the fundamentals of the society itself.Much of the film's running time is dedicated to develop the characters enough for the audience to know them, by showing what they're going through and what they've become by the end of the film. The lead actors, Theo James and Shailene Woodley, delivered a solid performance in their respective roles and have a convincing on-screen chemistry between them. Kate Winslet, despite her short screen time (only about 20 minutes), manage to solidify her presence throughout the film, hinting that we'll be seeing her more in the next two films. Moreover, the ideas and concepts behind the psychology aptitude tests to determine which faction the characters belong or join are commendable as well, as they show the inner fears of the characters and why they possess the personalities mentioned in the film.However, some parts of the film feels rushed, especially the third art of the film, due to its heavy world-building, plot and character development in the first and second act. The fans of the books might complain about the missing parts, but from a person who haven't read the books (me), it seems fine and acceptable to me. I believe the film gets the essence of its source material right, despite the complex nature of its source material.Regardless of what the critics or fans said, the worlds and characters of Divergent and the Hunger Games are very different. Each stands on its own and shouldn't be compared with one another. The film has a good start. By the end of the film, I'm interested to see how things will be unfolded in the next sequel, Insurgent, which is releasing next year and how the story concludes in Allegiant, which will be released a year after Insurgent.Rating: 8/10 'Individualism promotes personal freedom and achievement. Individualist culture awards social status to personal accomplishments such as important discoveries, innovations or great artistic achievements. Unfortunately, this threatens to those in power, the survival of a population of conformists that specifically adhere to well-defined rules and principles. So, the ones who are capable of thinking differently than others are usually rejected or deemed as outcasts in society. This creates a constant, endless struggle between individuality and conformity throughout the history of mankind.'",8,22,49,23 March 2014
The Lego Movie," A fun, entertaining animated film
","Based on the popular Lego line of construction toys, The LEGO movie is a fun, entertaining animated film, filled with numerous pop-culture references, together with an interesting, rather unexpected twist near the end of the film. The script was well-written, well-planned and well- executed.The film's storyline is rather formulaic and been done many times before: It's a story about an ordinary nobody, who lives his own life by the book, go through the same old routine everyday, conforming to specific sets of instructions...believing that 'Everything is Awesome'. But soon, he realize that there's a big world out there, that you can become something special...if you believe you are, if you believe you can do it.However, what makes this film different from the rest is the funny and laughable well-known western pop culture humors, parody, gags and puns found throughout the entire film. You just couldn't resist laughing at all. That's actually quite a remarkable feat for an animated film. The film is action-packed, in an amusing way. The CGI effects were excellent, it feels convincing that the film mostly made of Lego plastic building bricks...the vehicles, buildings, environments...even the explosions, flames, clouds, water were seemingly created entirely from Lego pieces. In addition, there were many well-known comic-book, cartoon character appearances in the film: Notable ones are DC comic superheroes (Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Flash), Lord Of The Rings Gandalf, Harry Potter's Professor Dumbledore, Star Wars' Han Solo and C3PO, Ninja Turtles' Michelangelo, Lincoln, Shakespeare and many more. They are the 'master builder', the so-called creative, intellectual ones who shapes the LEGO universe.The film also makes you think: Why must we live a life that's practically similar to others? Can you live a world where you're required to be creative and innovative most of the time? Should we follow instructions, live your life by the book or be creative, imaginative, innovative, different than others? Why should we choose one? Why can't it be both? Is there a balance in between?The movie's theme song 'Everything is Awesome!!' initially feels a bit awkward, but as the film progresses, the song somehow fits the movie and turns out to be quite catchy and cool.Overall, the LEGO movie will be a pleasant, satisfying watch for the kids and adults alike. Highly recommended.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/02/movie-review-lego-movie.html",8,0,2,20 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A brilliant sequel to First Class and the original film trilogy
","The X-Men film series has been 'hit-and-miss' throughout the years, from the successful 2000's X-Men and 2003's X-Men United, the mediocre and pointless standalone Wolverine films (2009 and 2013), to the terrible Last Stand (2006) and the excellent First Class prequel (2011). It's been 14 years long since Bryan Singer directed the first X-Men film that kickstarted the whole franchise. This time around, he's back directing the franchise's 7th installment (His third X-Men film), Days of Future Past.Loosely adapted from the 1981 Chris Claremont and John Byrne comic storyline of the same name, Days of Future Past intends to bridge the gap between the original trilogy of films and First Class, melding together the disjointed history of the X-Men world, erasing or fixing certain plot holes, continuity errors and inconsistencies that exist in the franchise, start anew and open up possibilities for future films. With that being said, this is considered the most epic and ambitious taking of the X-Men films to date.Days of Future Past fulfills its long-term promises and achieve the 'impossible'. This film wouldn't work without a solid foundation laid over throughout the years. We have known some of these characters for so long (4 films, 2 spin-offs) that we can identify with them strongly. Fans would definitely be pleased with the numerous cameo appearances of Marvel characters in the film as well.Because the film involves time travel (a story that jumps back and forth between 2023 and 1973), it is intensely plot-driven, linking the events that happened in past films together with historical events as part of the story. The film has decent pacing and story flow, successfully integrating both future and past timelines together, avoiding many of the typical time paradoxes without overcomplicating the story.The film takes the best thing about the X-Men and show it to the audience: taking all of these 'gifted' individuals and make them into a team, watch how they face and solve issues inherent to teamwork. Forget The Avengers. This film has two generation of mutants from two different timelines (14 of them) teaming up to prevent an apocalyptic future that could mean the extinction of both mutants and humans.Finally at last, Marvel fans get to see how these individuals complement one another in terms of power, weakness and personality by teaming up to fight against an army of mutant-hunting, lethal Sentinels. There's also one amazing action sequence involving Quicksilver, which is probably one of the film's highlights. The way he infiltrates and stages the prison break from a highly-secured Pentagon cell is simply brilliant. Not to mention, the song that comes with the scene is spot-on as well.While many would have thought this film is overcrowded with characters, but this is not the case. The film cleverly focuses on young Xavier's character arc, which acts as the central story that ties the various subplots together into a single narrative, watching him go from a guy who lost nearly everything...his legs, his best friend, his adopted sister, his students due to the Vietnam War (his school as well) to a guy who will become the powerful, wise, compassionate teacher and leader of the X-Men in the future. There's a wonderfully shot, exceptionally acted, heartfelt moment in the film...the conversation between the young and old Xavier. 'Please...We need you to hope again...' pleads the older and wiser Xavier, with emotional heft and gravitas to his broken and disheartened younger self.However, the franchise has yet to provide a compelling villain that poses a huge threat to the X-Men. The series have always been repeatedly dwelling with themes of discrimination, prejudice and social injustice...with the human race always in conflict with the mutants. (This will soon change in the next sequel) There's another gripe regarding the CGI effects presented in the film. Some of the shots aren't realistic enough and shown to be rather sloppy, which is definitely not expected from a high-budget Hollywood blockbuster film. Overall, this latest instalment of X-Men film series have left me incredibly hopeful for the upcoming sequel, X-Men: Apocalypse. Highly recommended.Rating: 9/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-x-men-days-of-future- past.htmlNote: As usual with many Marvel films, please stay for the after-credits scene.",9,1,2,23 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Still a worthy fantasy action adventure epic to watch
","The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug continues the exciting adventure of the hobbit Bilbo with 13 dwarfs and Gandalf (although he left halfway to investigate an important matter) to reclaim the lost kingdom of Erebor, which happens early before the events of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.As a prequel to famous The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug proved to be an entertaining, engaging and enjoyable fantasy adventure epic, much better than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in terms of action, humour and CGI and makeup effects for the beasts and creatures of the lore. The scenery shots for the film were magnificent as well. It's nice to see an old character again, the fan favourite (for females), Legolas, the brief mentioning of Gimli and the resurgence of Sauron and his dark forces.Although there are various subplots found in the film (introduction of a movie-only character, the meeting with Beorn and elves of Mirkwood, Tauriel and her brief romance with Kili, Gandalf's investigation and his eventual confrontation of an old and powerful foe, introduction of Bard and the people of Lake Town, the appearance of Smaug), Jackson managed them well by balancing the subplots with some exciting action scenes. Notably, the barrel chase, confrontation between Gandalf and 'Necromancer', Bilbo and Smaug scenes were well made enough to be considered the best scenes of the trilogy so far.Tauriel, the silvan elf is a great new addition to the LOTR lore, proving to be a capable fierce warrior like Legolas. It's always interesting to see a strong, capable woman in a male-dominating story. On the other hand, the appearance of Smaug is truly a presence to behold as we don't often see dragons of this scale in films.Despite its merits, it might be too far of a stretch to make a trilogy from a single book as it never feels as epic and grand as the LOTR trilogy...seemingly lacking a compelling central plot to move the story forward for a 161-mins film. The film also suffers from numerous contrivances, a common problem to many fantasy films...just to name a few: the spiders that manage to catch the group are not eating them immediately, Legolas & Tauriel seemingly always arrive in the nick of time to rescue the main characters, Bard the Bowman just happens to be around when they need help to cross the river, Smaug doesn't kill Bilbo immediately when he knows that he's there to steal the Arkenstone for the dwarfs...Although the film ends in a cliffhanger (and its shortcomings), which may upset some audience or fans, it's still proved to be a satisfying fun watch and I find myself excited to watch the last instalment of the trilogy, The Hobbit: There and Back Again next year.",8,3,8,18 December 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," A heartwarming, touching, beautiful romantic drama comedy film
","Based on the popular romantic novel by John Green, The Fault in Our Stars is another story about a pair of star-crossed lovers who care immensely for each other but couldn't be together due to their unfortunate circumstances. I believe for those who have never read the book or watched the trailer would assume that this film to be those weepy, sappy melodramatic mess, right? Well, not exactly.Surprisingly, the film is a heartwarming and touching love story wrapped in exceedingly witty dialogue and memorable one liners, successfully preventing itself from making its way into melodramatic territory. The comedy and romance is well-balanced. The film is also slightly mature and wise in its content and character perspectives: What is oblivion? Is there any meaning or purpose in life? Can we truly outlast death by being remembered by everyone in the world? What should we actually seek in our short life?The main female lead, Hazel, who suffered through cancer most of her life, doesn't anticipate much from her life, as her days are numbered. Out of nowhere, here comes Augustus, a surprisingly charming cancer survivor who's seemingly optimistic about his future. Augustus's charming smile and his relentless devotion of love for Hazel captured her heart. They're both equally smart and the on-screen chemistry between Shailene (Hazel) and Ansel (Augustus) made their instant connection believable.Shailene and Ansel both provide convincing performances as a couple. The romance was subtle, feels honest and realistic for the audience to emotionally invested in them. Their affection for each other deepens as the film progresses and it's heartbreaking to see that this relationship doesn't last. (I don't think I'm spoiling it, as we all know what we signed up for even before watching it). The film doesn't overly exploit the romance drama that's usually comes with the chronic disease, which is commendable. Rather than making it the typical depressing melodramatic tearjerker, the film has a bittersweet ending with surprising depth and meaning about life.The eulogies written by the leads for each other is thought-provoking and heartfelt at the same time. I have a few gripes about the film though...I would appreciate if the film adds more scenes about their cancer sufferings. Cancer is not a joke. The film seemingly gives an impression to the general audience that stage 4 cancer sufferers can still live and converse normally like many others without the repetitive time-consuming treatments, dealing with severe side effects from drugs or countless hospitalization. The film does feel draggy a bit in some parts as well. Overall, despite some shortcomings, The Fault in Our Stars is still undeniably a decent romantic drama comedy that's well worth your time and money.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/07 Rating: 8/10",8,0,1,14 July 2014
Before Sunset," Completes as one of the best romantic trilogy of all time
","As Before Midnight, Sunset, Sunrise are interrelated, it's best to put all 3 three together:Before Midnight (2013)The sequel to Before Sunset and Before Sunrise, the film is a continuation of the story of Jesse and Celine after a further nine years. They've decided to be together after their encounter in the Before Sunset and have kids.This time around, they're on the last few days of a family vacation with their kids in Greece. Jesse worries about his son's wellbeing from his previous failed marriage, which triggers a relationship assessment for the couple after all these years. Once again, the screenplay is written by both the actors themselves and it is astounding. Witty, intelligent, realistic, thought provoking and occasionally humorous, they talked about family issues, work, marriage, the obligations of parenthood, the complexity that lies in long-term commitments, insecurity, struggle of feminism. In the film, Celine's feminist ideas push her to behave in ways we've not seen her do before, many of the romanticism on her have faded away since the first film. Their lives have moved on since then, life is no longer hers alone and she has make some sacrifices for their relationship to work. Their heat argument near the end of the film reveals the hidden tensions in their relationship...the fears, resentments, insecurities, loneliness throughout the years and this reflects a lot of real-life married couple problems. A truly remarkable film that's fascinating to watch. Rating: 9/10Before Sunset (2004)The story of Jesse and Celine continues again after nine years (the film is also made nine years after the first one). They didn't managed to meet each other at the Vienna train station six months after the events of Before Sunrise. Jesse, couldn't forget their fateful encounter, decided to wrote a book about them. This allows Celine to find Jesse at a bookstore in France and their conversation continues again. The dialogue is superb, even more interesting and personal as his time around, they talked about their troubled love life, politics, environmental issues...Throughout the film, they started to show their imperfections, burdened by numerous responsibilities as they talk about the mistakes they made in life and the disappointments that comes with it. The effects of aging are noticeable from their faces. This film is definitely better than the first, because it provides a more unique, personal perspective. The characters have grown and matured throughout the years. From here, it's becoming apparent that these two characters are soul mates and they were meant for each other. Interestingly, the film's dialogue are both written by the actor and actress themselves. One can't help but to assume that the two leads may have actually shared some personal conversations during the making of the film.Rating: 8.5/10Before Sunrise (1995)The story is about a young guy, Jesse and a young girl, Celine randomly meet on a train in Europe and they're both decided to spend the whole night together, talking about life and love in Vienna. As they walk around Vienna the whole night and communicating with each other, sharing their personal life experiences, you can see a deep connection slowly formed between them. The two lead actors, Ethan and Julie, shared a perfect chemistry together on screen.The script for the film is magnificent as the dialogues managed to keep the audience engaged throughout the film.Their conversations about love provides a lot of insights about relationships.They share their views, thoughts, perspectives of anything...and as they speak, you feel that you started to know these characters as well. The film successfully captures the beauty of youthful love, two beautiful people meet in a romantic setting and attracted to each other.Rating: 8/10Overall: Linklater, together with Ethan and Julie, had crafted the one of the best romantic drama trilogy of all time.The films features an in- depth look into the characters, their life experiences and how it affects their love life...of being together.The films allow us to see one woman and one man changes over the course of time. Note: Keep in mind though, the films are dialogue driven and spend most of the time on the conversations between the leads, how they managed to find a connection between them, share their thoughts, views, perspectives, principles in life...If you find that two people communicating is not enjoyable, then it's not recommended to watch the trilogy.But it'll be incredibly rewarding if you do.",8,0,0,28 December 2013
Non-Stop," another highly intense, suspenseful, engaging, entertaining, satisfying action thriller
","Non-Stop is another highly intense, suspenseful, engaging, entertaining, satisfying action thriller with Liam Neeson stars as the one man action hero (again). Despite an old age of 61, Liam Neeson still got what it takes to be the 'man'. This time around, he's an alcoholic, aerophobic Federal Air Marshal haunted by the past, whose job is to quietly protect flight passengers and ensure that they land safely. The film takes place on an international flight from New York to London.As usual with many thrillers in the past, the audiences were 'invited' to play guessing games as the film progresses...who's the real hijacker? What actually happened? What's going to happen? How the next victim going to be killed? Who's the next victim? What will our main hero do next? This film is in many ways similar to Taken, another brilliant action thriller with Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA agent trying to rescue his daughter, but less violent and more suspense. the film does raise a few questions on flight security, the various precautions and measures taken against terrorism since 9/11.Yes, the film has too many contrivances (However, Within the film's context, some of the contrivances work well though)...Sure, the plot is flawed and clichÃ©-ridden...but it's sure one hell of a ride! Who cares when Liam Neeson is here to kick ass? This is one of those guilty pleasure movies, the ones that aren't great but we love for some reason.Rating: 8/10 (Sorry, I enjoyed it very much) http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/02/movie-review-non-stop.html",8,3,11,27 February 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," An outstanding sequel that will certainly captures the hearts of many
","How to Train Your Dragon is widely regarded as one of the best animated films ever made by Dreamworks Animation. As usual, it's about time that we get another sequel for this box-office hit. The big question is: Will it succeed and turns out better than its predecessor? Well, it's a definite yes, and this film will definitely soar and wins the hearts of many.The sequel reunites us with the village of Berk and its people, comes with a darker tone and emotional heft this time around, which puts the unusual friendship formed between the lead, Hiccup and his Night Fury dragon, Toothless to the test. It focused more on world building to expand its story, explains the nature and hidden abilities of the dragons, other than plot and character development. Aside from that, Hiccup needs to learn to take responsibility for his Viking clan, as his father, Stoick decides to hand over his position as Chief Of Berk to him. While the film does have its serious moments, it also retains its predecessor's fun action-adventure style with clever witty dialogue as well. The film is visually appealing, its CGI effects were improved and better this time around. The flying sequences with Hiccup and Toothless, together with the film's score, were spectacular than ever before. Toothless remains adorable and would certainly manage to charm both adults and children alike. The film also introduces new breed of wonderfully coloured dragons, each of them comes with a personality and manage to create an impression to the viewer despite their brief appearance in the film.The film's emotional moments...notably the arc between Hiccup and his long-lost mother, Valka, as well as the heartwarming reunion between Stoick and Valka after so many years apart from each other were done in a remarkably poignant manner that captures your heart...together with the unexpected, surprising and deeply affecting twist near the climactic third act, this film managed to bring me to tears not once, but twice.The film loses none of the heart that's previously established by its predecessor. It's simply outstanding on so many levels that it's completely worthy of praise. It's a thrill ride that's both entertaining and moving at the same time. If you love and enjoy the first film, then I guarantee you will love this sequel. It's one of the best animated films of the year.Rating: 8.5/10 For more reviews: http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014",8,4,15,8 June 2014
Frozen," A worthy entry to the long line of Disney's greatest animated musical classics
","Frozen is the latest successful animated musical entry from Disney after Tangled. The story is heartwarming, emotionally engaging, unpretentious and enjoyable to watch at the same time. It also provides a good plot twist before the climax. Much like Tangled, Disney managed to return to its old roots by recapturing the long lost Disney classic magic that enthralled the hearts of young and old.The story's main focus is on sisterhood love compared to romantic ones in the past. However, it does redefine the meaning of true love and and provides a clear moral message to the current younger generation: know the person you fall in love with, not just based on looks and appearances.The animation is top notch and stunning to watch. The soundtrack for the film is fantastic: the lovely songs 'Let It Go', 'For the first time in forever', 'Do You Want to Build a Snowman?', 'Love is an Open Door'...are all good in its own right.Both princesses in the film are unique, independent, strong, brave young women which can serve good inspirations for many young girls out there. Young Elsa and Anna were so cute and adorable. Elsa is a very interesting character, it's quite rare for Disney to create a female character who is both complex and sympathetic at the same time. Sees herself as only a force of destruction, feeling that she doesn't belong in the Kingdom of Arendelle, it's actually quite heartbreaking to see Elsa forced to suppress her powers, withdraw all her emotions and tragically isolated from the outside world at a very young age just to protect her family and people.Come to think of it, it's actually quite a shame that she's not paired with a partner who truly love and understand her other than her sister (Although the current plot is not bad, it's just that it would be better if Elsa have a loving partner and her sister as well. She deserves it.).Overall, this film is definitely a worthy entry to the long line of Disney's greatest animated musical classics for the years to come. Finally, Disney returned to its former glory. Highly recommended to any family or Disney fans who loved the classics.Animated short film - 'Get a horse': Although it blends in the classic black and white look and modern 3D animation of Mickey, Minnie, and Pete, but nothing spectacular or worth mentioning here compared to Pixar's thoughtful animated shorts.Rating: 8.5/10",8,2,3,8 December 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," a wonderful, inspiring fantasy drama comedy adventure
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a visually beautiful, wonderful fantasy drama comedy film that comes with a simple but essential life message that's both inspiring and make you feel good at the same time. This film is essentially about a boring, hardworking, single and lonely, middle-class daydreamer with an active imagination, who frequently 'zoned out' to undergo fantastic adventures in his mind.In this film, Stiller allows the character he portrays to shine, showing the gradual change in his character throughout the film without a differing core personality. Although the starting of the film suffers a few minor 'hiccups' due to a few abrupt, over-the-top fantasy dream adventures, the film starts to improve as Walter embarks on a life- altering adventure that manages to inspire and affect the audience without the feeling of being pretentious.Not sure why most of the professional critics dislike it so much, some even mentioning that his fantasy adventures are greater than his actual trip he embarked in the second half of the film. Although his fantasies are greatly exaggerated by the usage of modern CGI, his actual journey were nothing short of impressive as not many of us would be lucky enough to encounter such events in our travels.Perhaps the critics don't realise how hard it is to survive from a great white and very cold sea waters, cycle around the roads of Iceland, to witness the beautiful landscapes of Iceland, to daringly skateboard your way to a town, to barely escape from a volcano eruption, to encounter and barter with the warlords in ungoverned Afghanistan, to hike the mountains of Himalayas or even damn lucky enough to see a snow leopard in the wild (Snow leopards are very shy, elusive cats known for their solitary nature, are rarely seen in the wild.Total estimated population could be 4000-7000).The film also reminds us of the current problem of our generation, the obsession of taking great photographs. Yes, photographs are important. It lets us reminisce the good old memories of the past. But, don't forget to live the moment as well as they're precious and brief.Very highly recommended. This is a fun film with a whole-hearted simple story. Try to put your cynicism aside and just enjoy it, let Walter 'take' you into his fantastical journey. You'll not be disappointed.Rating: 8.5/10'Don't work too hard in life, live it. Don't just dream too much about doing something, do it. Don't just obsessing over taking photos for every great moment in your life, learn to live these precious moments as well.''Life is about courage and going into the unknown''To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind wall, draw closer, to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of life.'http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/12/movie-review-secret-of-walter- mitty.html",8,2,5,28 December 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A disappointing sequel to a beloved superhero...
","After the less amazing and darker reboot of the Marvel Spidey franchise, Spider-Man is back again with a sequel, swinging between skyscrapers in New York City, with his perfectly-designed costume. It seems that Spidey's costume has evolved throughout the years...this newly-designed costume finally resembles the costume he always wears in the comics.Moreover, it is noticeable that Spidey's CGI renders have improved a lot as we see Spidey swings by on the streets of New York City. We also get to see what Spider-Man really does in battle - always jokes while moving swiftly with his super-reflexes. Garfield and Stone have terrific on- screen chemistry as a couple and they have a few genuinely funny and heartfelt moments together in the film. The film does come with a major shocking plot twist at the end (not so much for the fans who knew Spidey for a long time though)Despite the CGI and costume design improvements, plot twist and a strong relationship between Garfield and Stone, the entire plot structure of the film is a disaster as things just keeps on happening from scene to scene. The film is overstuffed with various subplots and the pieces don't fit together nicely, without a central story tying them together: the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents, Peter and Gwen's complicated relationship, the dual-sided nature of Harry and Peter's friendship, development of the new villains - Electro, Rhino and Green Goblin, Sinister Six setup, Aunt May and Peter's relationship after Uncle Ben's death...all in one film.The villains' motivations are fuzzy and poorly conceived. It's a pity to see such potential go to waste. Max/Electro and Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino barely have character development in the film at all. Their character arcs aren't properly fleshed out as intended and they're barely connected to the main protagonist's character arc. You won't feel anything missing if they're both completely removed from the story, since it doesn't affect the overall plot of the film at all. It's understandable that the purpose of Rhino's inclusion to the film is for the next sequel's setup. However, it seems that the inclusion of Electro in the film serves no purpose other than to add more exciting, extravagant action fight scenes for the audience to watch. While the extravagance of the action scenes make the film more entertaining, it feels cartoony and not realistic at all.Worst, the tone of the film shifts drastically back and forth between fun, not-so-serious and entertaining to emotional, serious and dark, which takes some time for the audience to adjust and keep up with, hurts the film a lot. When there's a tender, intimate moment between Peter and Gwen happening in the film and you start to feel the emotions coming, the film robs them away by abruptly shifting to an Electro scene, a clue to Peter's parent disappearance appears, or another Harry scene.As a long-time Spidey fan, I personally feel that the film fails to capture the most influential, emotional and devastating moment in Peter Parker's life before meeting his lifelong partner, Mary Jane in the future. It lacks the much-needed emotional buildup to deliver the punch in the end, which is not present due to the horrendous plot structure and inconsistent tonal shifts of the film. The various subplots constantly interfere and collide with each other because that's how it was structured in the script. While seemingly looks good in script, it just doesn't translate well on screen.Furthermore, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 repeats the same mistakes as Iron Man 2, too many heavy-handed foreshadowing for future sequels, instead of making it a compelling stand-alone film. While the sequel is better than its predecessor (the first Amazing Spider-Man film) in many ways, it's still not the hands-down, best Spidey film that many fans would hoped to see.Rating: 6/10Although the story has a terrible narrative structure, I believe the central theme of the story should be dealing with life's two biggest questions:Are you capable enough to deal with the repercussions of taking chances, knowing that they might happen in the future? Are you willing to accept the consequences of not taking those chances and in turn living regretfully because of it?http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-amazing-spider-man- 2.html",6,9,20,2 May 2014
Big Hero 6," One of the best animated films of the year
","This year is filled with so many great animated films...The Lego Movie, How to Train Your Dragon 2, The Boxtrolls, The Book of Life and now, Disney's new superhero animated feature - Big Hero 6. Adapted from the Marvel comics of the same name which is almost unheard of by many people (including myself), Big Hero 6 is a fun, entertaining, heartwarming and emotional film that's comparable to Pixar's superhero film, The Incredibles.Over the years, superhero films have become more complex and character-driven with thought-provoking, challenging messages to the audience. The same could be said for Big Hero 6 as well. This is a film about the excitement of learning and innovating new things. This is a film that's filled with complex, mature themes such as dealing with grief and loss of loved ones, making the right choices in life by letting go and forgive those who have wronged you.Big Hero 6 is a beautifully made film that's still incredibly charming and fun to watch despite its simple, straightforward and predictable story. The characters, even the awesome high-tech gadgets and suits are very well-designed. Moreover, the world presented in the film (the city of San Fransokyo - combination of San Francisco and Tokyo) is vibrant, colourful and futuristic, which is suitable for the story. Around the halfway mark of the film, we get to see the spectacular aerial view of the city as Hiro and Baymax were flying around to test the newly made armour prepared to fight with the main villain.The key to a successful animated film has always been creating one or two memorable, lively characters that young audiences could identify with, care about and love. The film succeeds the most by putting its focus on the relationship between Hiro, the lead human character and the hilarious, cute, lovable, cuddly, friendly and adorable inflatable healthcare robot Baymax, the heart of the film. The gentle robot instantly steals the show the moment it appears on screen, providing many joys and laughters that you wish you had him by your side as a personal companion/caregiver. He's clearly meant to be the character that every kid (or the kid inside you, for adults) should love. This film did a remarkable job in balancing action, drama and comedy. There are more enjoyable action scenes to satisfy the kids who loves action and several wonderful, hilarious, moving and emotional scenes of Hiro and Baymax together on screen to satisfy those who yearn for something profound and impactful. There are two particularly emotionally moving and heartfelt scenes that brought me to tears.However, the film does have its flaws. The four supporting human characters (including the villain) are quite underdeveloped and it feels like we hardly know them much by the end of the film other than they're friends with Hiro and they will always be there for him. However, it's not significant enough to hurt my enjoyment of the film. Overall, Big Hero 6 is the perfect animated film for young nerdy kids and adults alike. It's one of the best animated films of the year.Rating: 8.5/10Note: Be sure to stay for the after-credit scene. http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/11/movie-review-big-hero-6.html",8,10,23,18 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Not the best Marvel film ever, but still a decent superhero film
","Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, entertaining, spectacular sci-fi action comedy adventure. However, despite the rave reviews from the critics and mainstream audience, I just don't think the film actually lives up to the hype and expectations to be a great one. Let me explain why.The story is mainly about a band of interstellar thieves, thugs and assassins - Star lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax, got caught up in a huge galactic threat when one of them retrieved a highly-desired mysterious orb from a desolated planet. These individuals eventually decided to work together as a team and become heroes along the way to stop the threat.Before this, the Guardians Of The Galaxy consists of characters not known by many, even among the Marvel fan base. It's officially the first Marvel film that ventures into space, introducing the general audience to the expansive intergalactic worlds in the Marvel Cinematic Universe...with an entirely new team and not the previously established Avengers. It brings the audience to a whole new unseen world, featuring a multitude of alien species with distinctive personalities and abilities, with addition of exciting spaceship battles and chases as well.The visuals are spectacular and the action scenes were great. Many of the 1960s/1970s pop classics that forms the soundtrack blends in quite nicely with the film. Each Guardian have their own kick-ass, cool or funny character moments in the film. The action scenes between Drax and Ronan or Korath, Gamora and Nebula, Star Lord and the Sakaaran army are really well done. But, among the Guardians, it is actually a giant walking tree and a talking raccoon that stole the spotlight compared with the others! When Groot extends his arm and pierces through a few Sakaaran army soldiers and repeatedly slams them against the walls is both shocking and awesome.The 'We are Groot' scene or Rocket's expression when Drax tries to comfort him by gently petting his head are beautifully done and emotional at the same time.All the Marvel films, since Iron Man, did a great job of making fun at itself by injecting decent amount of humour and witty lines into the story, keeping the audience laughing along the way. This worked out fine...the engaging sense of humour actually helps to balance out the drama and action to make the films fun and entertaining to watch. But this time, they went overboard with it. Guardians of the Galaxy is so overly playful with itself that it has gotten too self-absorbed with its humour. It felt cartoony at times and lacks the seriousness it needs to be an epic film. It's been shown that billions of lives are at stake and even the galaxy is under serious threat. How do you even care what's at stake when the film doesn't take itself seriously when it should? (Moreover, some of the jokes presented in the film didn't work for me at all)The film has too many new characters and most of them only make brief appearances...there's a lot of new unfamiliar places or locations which are previously unheard of without proper explanation. There's no character depth for each of the Guardians, you don't feel like you know them much by the end of the film as their backstories were only briefly touched upon. Gamora, also known as the galaxy's deadliest assassin or the Deadliest Woman in the Galaxy, trained by Thanos, gets easily beaten by others? The romance of Gamora with Star lord feels forced as well. I was also slightly disappointed that Thanos only make a brief cameo appearance...I expected more of his involvement in the film. It didn't create any strong lasting impression for the characters, much like Captain America: The First Avenger and Iron Man did for their main characters. The pacing doesn't flow well as the story never slows down and there's too many things to cover in the film.There's so many small fine details that the general audience (those who are unfamiliar with the Marvel Universe) most likely won't know or understand: No one knows who Tivan/The Collector actually is or the Yaka arrow that Yondu carries around with him...the film didn't clearly explains what the infinity stones represents (mind, power, reality, space, soul, time), no mention of the Infinity Gauntlet, who is the giant figure that uses the Power stone, etc. Most of these details should be explained in this film instead of relying on the next sequel to do the job.Like all the previous Marvel films (except Thor, who has Loki), Guardians of the Galaxy lacks a memorable and compelling villain for the story. There's a lack of character development for Ronan The Accuser. Ronan's lieutenants, Korath and Nebula (also Thanos' adopted daughter), bring nothing to the table...we don't know them much at all. For those who are expecting a great epic teamwork battle in the finale will be disappointed. Why would a villain who hates an entire race and planet, tries to avenge his father's and ancestor's deaths could be easily distracted? 'What are you doing?' I find myself having the same response as Ronan, questioning the director's decision for making Star lord pulling such a ridiculous act on screen. Come on, you have a villain who's in possession of the Power stone and this is what you can do with the character?Like I mentioned earlier in the review, the film was fun and entertaining, but it was too much that nothing feels serious anymore. It's certainly not the best Marvel film ever. In my opinion, X-Men: Days of Future Past still remains as the best Marvel film of the year.Rating: 7.5/10Note: The post-credit scene was quite disappointing and not worth the wait. They supposed to add something that raises the expectations for future films but they didn't. That sucks.",7,4,6,3 August 2014
Prisoners," a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller
","Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html",8,344,409,22 September 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A good worthy sequel, but without exceeding expectations
","After the first Avengers film 3 years ago, we finally get to see the gang back together again! Being one of the most highly anticipated films of 2015, can Marvel deliver its magic once again with a slightly darker, serious and slightly complex plot line? (don't worry, not as dark and serious as the Dark Knight Trilogy or Man of Steel) Well, safely to say, it's still undeniably another massively entertaining and enjoyable feast for Marvel fans. There are more awesome and cooler action sequences, wonderful character moments with funny witty dialogues, spectacular visuals with more new Avenger characters filling in this time around. With writer/director Joss Whedon at helm again with all the same actors reprising their roles, the film still feels lively with the occasional team banters.There's a lot to deliver in Avengers: Age of Ultron...aside from the main plot line, world-building, bigger and better action scenes that needs to be in the sequel, it needs to set up the beginnings of Marvel's Phase 3 plans as well. As a result, there are lots of subplots and references going around in the film for fans to take note of: Tony and Steve clashing ideologies for Captain America: Civil War, mentioning of Wakanda and the introduction of Ulysses Klaw, enemy of Black Panther and Thor's vision of Asgard for Thor: Ragnarok and Infinity War. So it's definitely not an easy task for Joss Whedon to juggle with so many characters in the same film. Thankfully, every hero does get their chance to shine. Surprisingly, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Clint Barton/Hawkeye have bigger roles this time around and are more involved than before with their character arcs. The film is very clear with its theme, by showing how misguided intentions, no matter how noble they may be, could potentially lead to more death and destruction.The action scenes are very well choreographed with superb, top notch CGI effects. Hulk is getting more screen time smashing several Ultron robots with his fists, and even Iron Man, himself too. The massive, destructive battle between the Hulkbuster Mark 44 Iron Man suit against the Hulk is definitely one of the highlights of the film. Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Vision, they all have a good balance of action screen time to show their abilities against Ultron and his robotic armies (except for War Machine and Falcon, which have a slightly minor role compared with the rest). The final climactic battle of the film is certainly the most over-the-top, 'comic booky' thing ever put on screen (not sure it's a good or bad thing).With that being said, now comes the bad part. The film has too many new characters introduced in this sequel and not enough character development to make them memorable (despite the film's long running time) and this hurts the film a lot. The 'Enchanced' Twins' origins were simply brushed off by a few lines from the main characters and Vision's powers were not clearly explained in the film. Moreover, there's too much going on that there's simply no time for the casual audience (non-Marvel fans) to take a breather and slowly digest the new plot and character developments.There were lots of sudden plot developments shoehorned into the story: forced romance between Banner/Hulk and Natasha/Black Widow (When did Natasha start having feelings for Banner?), the introduction of two vital team members - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, the birth and introduction of Vision, the increased development of Hawkeye, the introduction and development of the main villain, Ultron. Not to mention, there are other members of the gang needs to be on the spotlight as well.The main villain, Ultron is rather disappointing. His motivations of destroying humanity aren't clear enough, his grudge against Tony feels rushed and underdeveloped, which makes him less compelling. In comparison, Scarlet Witch is a far more terrifying force compared to Ultron as the film clearly shows that she has the power to tear the whole team (Avengers) apart like they were nothing.In short, is Avengers: Age of Ultron as good as The Avengers? Well, it's near there and it's good enough, but without exceeding expectations. It seems that the film is quite rushed and fast-paced due to the editing cuts needed to make the film shorter (the first cut is said to be roughly 3 hours). The script does feel slightly weaker than the more well-constructed first film, but the action, witty dialogue is more than enough to make up for it. With the release of The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel's second Phase is coming to an end very soon (after this year's Ant-Man).http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2015/04/movie-review-avengers-age-of- ultron.html",8,9,20,23 April 2015
12 Years a Slave," a powerful drama that shows the brutal practise of slavery in the past
","12 Years a Slave, based on 1853 autobiography book written by Solomon Northup himself, a New York born free African American who was kidnapped in 1841, sold into slavery, received harsh treatments when working on plantations for 12 years before his release. The film painfully displayed the cruel and evil nature of humanity, performing hideous acts of racism to others...where people are treated as mere properties, not human beings.The hanging, raping, beating and whipping of the black slaves are heart-wrenching at times to watch. More specifically, the abuse and torture Patsey received are brutal and inhumane when she's done nothing wrong at all. It makes you constantly wonder what wrong they had done to deserve such brutal treatment from others...just because of different skin colour? It's actually despicable for the people to even dare to speak about God when they do sinful acts of cruelty themselves on others.Furthermore, the film also shows that not just white men at that time and age were evil, but the black slaves as well. They just choose to ignore the pain and sufferings of their fellow for fearing that they may receive a harsher punishment. Chiwetel Ejiofor managed to deliver a convincing performance, successfully conveying his emotions during the sufferings.I find myself nearly in tears when he is finally returned to his family and he said sorry to his wife in tears.Other supporting actors (Paul Dano, John and particularly Fassbender, Epps) did a great job in making the audience hate them so much to the point we actually cheer Solomon as he hit Paul's character back with the whip and Solomon is finally free from Epps when Mr.Parker arrived to rescue him. The downside of the movie is the lack of a great score to make the emotional scenes pack a punch. Although Hans Zimmer is hired as the composer, but it seems that he just reuse Inception's main theme for the film. As a result, it does hurts the film a little.Overall, 12 Years a Slave is a powerful drama that shows the brutal practise of slavery in America of the past. It reminds us about men's cruelty to its own kind.Rating: 8.5/10",8,1,3,29 December 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," A well-made sci-fi action comedy thriller, one of the good films of the year
","Although it is based on the widely-praised 2004 Japanese sci-fi light novel All You Need is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, Edge of Tomorrow is a film that reminds you of Groundhog Day (1993), Source Code (2011), Starship Troopers (1997) and Elysium (2013) due to the similarities of the plot elements. Therefore, comparisons are inevitable for some viewers for an alien invasion war film that features time loops and powered exoskeleton suits. But surprisingly, the film managed to stay fresh and entertain the audience with enough humour, action and suspense from start to finish.The story is about an untrained US military officer, Major William Cage, who's just a spokesperson for the army in the United Defence Force with no battlefield experience whatsoever. He was demoted to private following an act of cowardice and being forcefully sent to the battlefield by the general to fight a losing war against the 'Mimics' - invading aliens with the ability to efficiently respond to Earth's military combat strategies.When Cage is sent to the front lines, he managed to kill a large and extremely rare Alpha Mimic by sheer luck but winds up dead. However, due to his exposure to the Alpha mimic's blood, Cage gains the time-loop ability to relive the same day over and over again each time he dies. Remembering what's going to happen when and where, Cage eventually managed to save Rita, a.k.a. 'Full Metal Bitch' who once had the same ability as him. With Rita's help, Cage's skill as a soldier grows in each subsequent time loop and they work together as a team to find a way to end the war. That's roughly how the story goes.Despite its time-loop plot device, the film never feels tedious or repetitive due to the occasional humour that comes with Cage's time- looping experience. The repeated scenes were shot at different angles and Cage's response to the situation is different each time that it feels fresh even when he relives his day again. The relationship between Cage and Rita is nicely developed and the constant reintroduction between them is swiftly handled. It's surprisingly funny to see Rita shoots Cage for his countless failures during training and he needs to wake up, find her and get shot again and again. There's also another ridiculously funny scene where members of his squad find him for a fight due to his absence during the training, but Cage managed to remember the moves well that he's managed to avoid them with his eyes closed. The audience gets to see Cage's transition from a coward officer to a well- trained battlefield soldier throughout the film.The visual effects in the film are top notch and the battle scenes with the Mimics were shot in a fast-paced manner that they keep you engaged at all times. The exoskeleton battle suits are fully utilised in battle, equipped with many weapons. Tom Cruise has always been committed his role in films. Once again, he's giving his best performance as the lead and doing all the stunts himself, which is quite impressive (take note, he's 51). Emily Blunt is a complete badass in her role as Rita, especially when she swings her big sword to kill several Mimics at a time. The origin, function and intention of the Mimics are well explained to the audience without much confusion. However, there's a slight complaint though: most of the cast (especially J squad) does not have any real character development at all and need to rely on exposition to know who they are.Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is a well-made sci-fi action comedy thriller. It's funny, thrilling and action-packed, the story makes sense and everything falls into place nicely in the end. It's one of the good films released this year.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/06/movie-review-edge-of-tomorrow.htmlRating: 8/10",8,1,3,2 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," An awesome satirical film, a masterpiece of its own
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a satirical drama comedy film that's based on Jordan Belfort's autobiography of the same name, a story about a young and promising New York stockbroker who runs a firm that engages in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990s.First and foremost, it is to say that the film is not everyone's cup of tea for sure, due to its moral ambiguity, sexual content, vulgarity, presence of drugs and alcohol. We are shown, through Belfort, the dark, 'fucked-up' side of the world, in all its glory.Jordan Belfort is a smart crooked bastard. His depravity knows no bounds. Armed with an amazing 'gift of persuasion' in sales and a mind filled with various illegal financial strategies that allows him to earn huge commissions on selling useless penny stocks, makes millions upon millions during his day in the 90s, which leads him to a life of drugs, alcohol, prostitutes.He constantly speaks about money and the power it buys, the 'American Dream', his seemingly noble ideals, but the truth is that he is as vain, greedy, superficial, materialistic as they come. The film glorifies the excessive lifestyle it depicts, yet it is disturbingly fun to watch his indulgence in doing drugs and women in broad daylight, divorce his first wife who stood by him in difficult times for the seductive Naomi and the constant yearning to possess more money. Despite his terrible personality, Jordan still manage to win you over, due to Leonardo DiCaprio's charming, powerful and magnetic performance, who effortlessly unleash a kind of on-screen charisma that's proved to be quite difficult to hate. The casting of Margot Robbie as the sexy, gorgeous and vivacious Naomi Lapaglia, Jordan's second wife was perfect, especially the scene when Naomi spreads her legs open and tells Jordan he won't be getting sex any time soon, with Jordan seemingly begging to want it, only to learn that she is in full view of a security camera in the end is simply awesome.The running time of the film is close to 3 hours, the movie does feel a bit stretched despite its brilliant pacing and good story and character development.Overall, while some people will disagree with me on this, The wolf of wall street is an awesome film...a masterpiece of its own. It is a film that shows how easily, quickly and thoroughly the path of dreams can be corrupted beyond reckoning.Rating: 8.5/10",8,1,3,15 March 2014
The Conjuring," A successful terrifying yet engaging horror thriller
","The Conjuring is an impressively terrifying (hate to say this) yet engaging and heartfelt horror thriller, inspired by the hauntings of Perron family case faced by real paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren in the 1970s. Despite the fact that it's frightening to watch, one can't help but to feel impressed with the film at the same time. While the film offers nothing new to the genre (most of the elements presented in the film were done before...dolls, bed pulling, sleepwalking, animals dying in a weird way,etc), but the pacing and execution was brilliant.The acting main casts were excellent in delivering their best performance, especially Farmiga, her facial expressions is so convincing that you believe there's real evil lurking in that place. In addition, the lectures, investigations done by the Warrens in the film somehow managed to slowly build up the tension and convince many to believe that this story is rooted in reality. The film takes time to develop the characters and gives as much screen time as it possibly can to the daughters, so the audience can be involved with the family as the story progresses. Throughout the film, you're not just fear for the impending danger and doom that the Perrons will experience soon, but for the safety of the Warrens as well.Overall, James Wan successfully mixed the best elements of haunted house and demonic possession concepts into one film and cleverly delivered them in a seemingly refreshing way to the audience. If you're not afraid of being scared out of your life and would like a decent challenge, be my guest and go watch it now.",8,0,1,11 August 2013
The Wolverine," another pointless standalone sequel with an all too familiar, straightforward and predictable plot
","The Wolverine is another pointless standalone sequel with an all too familiar, straightforward and predictable plot.The Wolverine is slightly better compared to X-Men Origins: Wolverine in terms of plot but suffers by a series of unrealistic plot contrivances.Most of the supporting characters are given little or no character development throughout the film, they're just simply there for the sake of story progression.There's nothing wrong with Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, he showed his dedication ('Wolverine gym workout') and delivered his best portrayal of the character throughout the X-Men series. The problems lies on the script and the character himself. Although the film is loosely based on the 1982 Wolverine comic set in Japan, but is he a compelling character enough to earn 2 spin-offs in the franchise? The film never takes time to explore the temporary physical vulnerability experienced by Logan...how he feels and deals with the sudden change of his immortality. There's no solid motive or reason why Logan need to stay or remain in Japan. He can choose to leave anytime he wants during the earlier stages of the film, instead he chose to stay to protect someone he barely even know or care about. Furthermore, the relationship between Mariko and Logan feels forced and doesn't seem credible or real, they just barely know each other and the lack of on-screen chemistry between the lead actors makes it even worst.The film briefly mentioned about family honour, respect and love, but one would question about Mariko's action near the end of the 3rd act of the film.The action scenes didn't offer anything new (most of them done before by previous X-Men movies) and I'm probably one of the few who doesn't find the 300mph bullet train fight scene exhilarating or cool at all.The highlight of the film seems to be the mid-credit scene that might excite a lot of X-Men fans, foreshadowing what is going to happen for the next X-Men movie - Days of Future Past.A lot of questions raised as to why and how it happened, a good scene to pique the audience interest about what to come next year.Recent superhero movies of the decade such as The Avengers and The Dark Knight Trilogy have showed us that superhero films can be something more...and what The Wolverine delivers simply isn't enough anymore. In my opinion, X-Men: First Class is still the best (in terms of character development, story flow, acting, plot) in the X-Men film series.",6,2,8,26 July 2013
Before Sunrise," Completes as one of the best romantic trilogy of all time
","As Before Midnight, Sunset, Sunrise are interrelated, it's best to put all 3 three together:Before Midnight (2013)The sequel to Before Sunset and Before Sunrise, the film is a continuation of the story of Jesse and Celine after a further nine years. They've decided to be together after their encounter in the Before Sunset and have kids.This time around, they're on the last few days of a family vacation with their kids in Greece. Jesse worries about his son's wellbeing from his previous failed marriage, which triggers a relationship assessment for the couple after all these years. Once again, the screenplay is written by both the actors themselves and it is astounding. Witty, intelligent, realistic, thought provoking and occasionally humorous, they talked about family issues, work, marriage, the obligations of parenthood, the complexity that lies in long-term commitments, insecurity, struggle of feminism. In the film, Celine's feminist ideas push her to behave in ways we've not seen her do before, many of the romanticism on her have faded away since the first film. Their lives have moved on since then, life is no longer hers alone and she has make some sacrifices for their relationship to work. Their heat argument near the end of the film reveals the hidden tensions in their relationship...the fears, resentments, insecurities, loneliness throughout the years and this reflects a lot of real-life married couple problems. A truly remarkable film that's fascinating to watch. Rating: 9/10Before Sunset (2004)The story of Jesse and Celine continues again after nine years (the film is also made nine years after the first one). They didn't managed to meet each other at the Vienna train station six months after the events of Before Sunrise. Jesse, couldn't forget their fateful encounter, decided to wrote a book about them. This allows Celine to find Jesse at a bookstore in France and their conversation continues again. The dialogue is superb, even more interesting and personal as his time around, they talked about their troubled love life, politics, environmental issues...Throughout the film, they started to show their imperfections, burdened by numerous responsibilities as they talk about the mistakes they made in life and the disappointments that comes with it. The effects of aging are noticeable from their faces. This film is definitely better than the first, because it provides a more unique, personal perspective. The characters have grown and matured throughout the years. From here, it's becoming apparent that these two characters are soul mates and they were meant for each other. Interestingly, the film's dialogue are both written by the actor and actress themselves. One can't help but to assume that the two leads may have actually shared some personal conversations during the making of the film.Rating: 8.5/10Before Sunrise (1995)The story is about a young guy, Jesse and a young girl, Celine randomly meet on a train in Europe and they're both decided to spend the whole night together, talking about life and love in Vienna. As they walk around Vienna the whole night and communicating with each other, sharing their personal life experiences, you can see a deep connection slowly formed between them. The two lead actors, Ethan and Julie, shared a perfect chemistry together on screen.The script for the film is magnificent as the dialogues managed to keep the audience engaged throughout the film.Their conversations about love provides a lot of insights about relationships.They share their views, thoughts, perspectives of anything...and as they speak, you feel that you started to know these characters as well. The film successfully captures the beauty of youthful love, two beautiful people meet in a romantic setting and attracted to each other.Rating: 8/10Overall: Linklater, together with Ethan and Julie, had crafted the one of the best romantic drama trilogy of all time.The films features an in- depth look into the characters, their life experiences and how it affects their love life...of being together.The films allow us to see one woman and one man changes over the course of time. Note: Keep in mind though, the films are dialogue driven and spend most of the time on the conversations between the leads, how they managed to find a connection between them, share their thoughts, views, perspectives, principles in life...If you find that two people communicating is not enjoyable, then it's not recommended to watch the trilogy.But it'll be incredibly rewarding if you do.",8,0,0,28 December 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Another highly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi fantasy action thriller from Marvel
","Thor The Dark World is another highly entertaining, action-packed sci-fi fantasy action thriller with some surprising plot twists and surprises throughout the film. The sequel surpasses the first film for its stunning depiction of the other realms (especially Asgard, which is lacking in the first film). The artistic designs for the costumes, weapons, set designs were nothing short of impressive and visually spectacular.The film has a fine balance of action, humor and emotion. There are more enjoyable action scenes and several emotional scenes involving Loki in this sequel which proved to be better than the first film. The climatic battle and Dark Elves' assault on Asgard were shot brilliantly. There are several interesting cameo appearances which proved to be a delight to the Marvel fans as well. The lead actors managed to deliver charming and heartfelt performances and most of the character interactions in the film were great and handled very well (especially Thor and Loki's constant bicker).However, the film has a rather short running time (a mere 112 mins) considering the number of characters they have included in the film. The characters of Odin, Heimdall, Sif or Frigga are simply not given enough screen time, which is a minor disappointment. The Asgardian army are shown to be too weak considering their ability to invent flying ships or even an Einstein-Rosen bridge (Bifrost Bridge). The main antagonist of the film, Malekith is not shown to be compelling enough or rather generic, his intentions are not fully elaborated and has to rely on two other villains to further the narrative. There are some unnecessary characters and scenes in the film (Notably overly long scenes involving Ian or Richard). Strangely enough, the Dark Elves have their own alien language but the Asgardians don't (they speak English instead).The love triangle between Thor, Sif and Jane was not explored at all in the film.Furthermore, how Thor managed to arrive in New York in The Avengers film is not further explained in this sequel as well(The Bifrost Bridge has been destroyed and it is expected for the sequel to provide a proper explanation...The Avengers film just briefly mentioned that Odin have to find considerable amount of dark matter to get Thor to Earth).Overall, the film still succeeds as a decent entertainment and remain as a wonderful addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that will not disappoint the fans and satisfy most casual moviegoers.Rating: 8/10Note: As for all Marvel films, be sure to wait for the mid-credit and after-credit scenes.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/11/movie-review-thor-dark-world.html",8,1,5,6 November 2013
Lucy," A thought-provoking, fun, entertaining sci-fi action film
","First and foremost, Lucy isn't exactly the typical sci-fi action film that you would expect. The film shares many similarities with Limitless, Watchmen, The Matrix, The Tree of Life, Her and Transcendence. The film has a slightly misleading neuroscience premise that's based on the age-old, silly '10% of brain' myth that most humans use only 10% (or less) of their brain capacity. In actual fact, humans use nearly 100% of their brains in various ways...with many parts of our brain are not accessed consciously but rather subconsciously most of the time. However, humans never actually use 100% of their cerebral capacity consciously at the same time.The film is basically a story about a woman who is being forced to work as a drug mule manage to 'unlock' her entire brain capacity, consciously at the same time and gain exceedingly powerful physical and mental abilities after a packet of a newly-developed synthetic drug called 'CPH4' breaks inside of her body. However, her body becomes highly unstable and starts to disintegrate due to the limitation of the human body and she needs more and more of the drug to sustain herself. The film asks thought-provoking 'what ifs' questions that are meaningful, provocative and worthy of our attention: What if the synaptic networks of our brain are so perfectly connected that we are capable of transmit more information at one time? What if we have access to all our motory functions, deepest memories and knowledge in fractions of a second? What if we are capable of using 100% of our cerebral capacity, consciously at the same time (all regions of the brain are pushed to the limits and we are able to control the subconscious regions of the brain)? Most importantly, what would happen if a person eventually gains complete control/mastery of elementary/subatomic particles that exist in the quantum realm?The film gives some rather clear answers that may seem absurd, nonsensical or silly to many, but some of them actually makes perfect sense if you think about it carefully. However, it is true to say that the film borrowed a few scientific principles (the basics of quantum mechanics and brain functions) and embellished them a bit for entertainment purposes. At first, the person acquires various enhanced physical and mental capabilities: perfect marksmanship, extreme agility, instantaneous reflexes, fast absorption of knowledge, immunity to pain and fear...and subsequently, telepathy, telekinesis, the ability to interpret/decipher/control various electromagnetic waves, atemporal and able to perceive time in a non-linear perspective, clairvoyance, quantum teleportation across space-time continuum and matter or energy manipulation.In short, the film is actually a mixture of facts and fiction. Some parts of the film do require a fair amount of suspension of disbelief from audiences as the writer/director has taken some creative liberties with its grand and rather ambitious sci-fi premise (Besson has admitted that this film is a lot more fiction than science). Although some of the main lead's abilities look downright silly and ludicrous, they're actually quite new and imaginative.While all facts are not necessarily 'true'; some fiction are not entirely lies either. Just that the 'world' around us behaves like so, we tend to perceive it like so. This doesn't mean that in other parts of the Universe, the same rules apply. While some people might find it hard to understand, all things, including living beings, consist of matter which has mass and each of them occupy a space-time dimension. We are bounded by the laws of motion and gravity. We are our own observer as time is relative while we're moving through space-time. Although the film's premise is not horrible or completely illogical, the execution is rather sloppy at places. The film shows the evolution of all living things on this planet by cutting in various shots of nature or Universe. Unfortunately, all these pieces just don't fit together nicely and seems rather out of place. There are numerous plot contrivances to allow characters to perform a certain action just to move the plot forward. There's no character development and backstory. The characters in the film don't have any significant emotional attachment to any other person on the screen.Despite its shortcomings in characterization and plot, Scarlett Johansson managed to pull out a great performance to carry the film. Her panic shaking as she cries and begs for her life when she meets Mr.Jang for the first time or even when she wakes up after heavy sedation feels real and truly gives the feeling that she's in peril. Later on, when she is able to access her deepest memories and cry profusely during the phone conversation with her mum, it clearly shows her character's vulnerability. But as Lucy rapidly evolves, her lack of expression shows that she is gradually losing her emotions and humanity. It shows that she has truly become transcendent and no longer has any petty human concerns. On the other hand, Choi Min-sik done a great job as the merciless, frightening Korean drug kingpin, Mr.Jang. His presence on screen shows that he's not the man you would want to mess with. Unfortunately, Morgan Freeman doesn't have much to do with his character other than delivering exposition for the audience to know more about the premise.In my opinion, this is by no means a terrible film, it's rather fast- paced, thought-provoking and entertaining. The purpose of science fiction is to seek answers for big important questions, to pique your interest or curiosity to further question, to find the truth and making sense of the world around us. This film succeeds in this aspect, despite its flaws. I believe that you'll appreciate this film more if you're willing to make an effort to take a step further to ponder and think, seek answers to extract the facts included in the film.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/08",7,3,9,25 August 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," a brilliantly made, well-paced, compelling sci-fi action drama thriller
","Despite from a young adult novel similar to Twilight, Beautiful Creatures, Mortal Instruments, or Percy Jackson, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire proved to be a brilliantly made, well-paced, compelling sci-fi action drama thriller that's well surpassed the first film, and dare I say, even better than any of the recent young adult novel-to-film adaptations out there. The film spends the first half of the film to explore and develop its thought-provoking themes: totalitarianism (more specifically fascism, extreme far right of the political spectrum), inequality and class warfare, oppression,the abuse of social media and political manipulation eventual uprising and revolution, hope, courage and sacrifice, the psychological consequences of taking human lives. These are the thematic elements that make this film stand out among others. Moreover, the film further addresses the personal feelings of the hunger games victors in the aftermath of the games in the first film...how they feel as a result of killing others. The film also takes time to further develop the love triangle relationship between Katniss, Gale and Peeta...Although Katniss' feelings with Gale (childhood sweetheart) remains unchanged, it is noticeable that Katniss really cared about Peeta and starting to fall in love with him as the film progresses. The entire film comes across as far more complex, heartfelt than its predecessor.At the young age of 23, Jennifer Lawrence managed to pull out such a great performance to carry the film and letting the audience feel emotionally engaged throughout the film. Although the scope of the film is getting bigger, the film never ceases to focus on Katniss' feelings, about how she deals with the situation. The set (jungle arena) and costume designs were amazing this time around as they get a bigger budget (Jennifer looks good in the 'wedding' dress)However, the film does have its flaws. most of the thrills of the tournament are left out in order to develop the story. We don't get to really know the contestants in detail (other than they're the previous champions of the games), they're just there to be eventually killed by others due to the tight-writing of the tournament. It is not further explained in the film either on why some participants willing to sacrifice their lives in order to save others whom they barely know (possibly for the greater good as they now become a symbol of hope for the districts?).Furthermore, the shaky-cam filming for some of the action scenes hurts the film as well.As mentioned in the title, this film is truly 'catching fire', exceeds expectations and further promises an epic conclusion near the end of the film. Now, I'm really excited and looking forward to see how Mockingjay is going to be adapted into two films (Part 1 & 2) to provide a satisfying conclusion to the series.Highly recommended.",9,2,21,24 November 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla is an awe-inspiring spectacle that truly delivers
","After the failed 1998 version of Godzilla, a Jurassic Park ripoff (there are many scenes lifted shot-for-shot from Jurassic Park) which nearly destroyed the franchise by making the titled monster looked nothing more than a giant iguana with spikes, Hollywood decided to make another American reboot again for the well-known Japanese pop-culture icon. The Japanese hated the 1998 version so much that they named the Iguana monster as 'Zilla', without 'god' and they even have a film (Godzilla: Final Wars) where 'Zilla' get blown to bits by the real Godzilla. So, this time, does it truly deliver? YES.From the menacing look...the thunderous roar...the humongous 107m (350ft) size...the trademark back plates...the gargantuan tail whip...the signature atomic breath...Godzilla is a word taken from 'Gojira', a combination of two Japanese words: gorira ('gorilla')and kujira ('whale'), implying his enormous size, power and aquatic origin.The newly-designed Godzilla is more faithful to its Japanese origins, done with Hollywood's state-of-art CGI effects (instead of a man-in-suit costume). The film respects of the monster's dark nuclear roots by showing the nuclear tests done in the past as attempts to kill it (although it enhanced the creature, making it bigger, powerful and stronger than before).The film done a great job in portraying the monsters, showing them as animals that tries to survive, trying to do what it takes to defend their territories or reproduce. The CGI was really good and the shots of godzilla or the MUTOs (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) appearing on screen were nothing short of incredible. The film chooses to hold back the Kaiju battles until the end and gradually reveal Godzilla's body parts (the spiky back plates in the Pacific, the gigantic tail, the stomping foot, the massive chest, etc) from various human viewpoint camera angles before making his full appearance.While many would think this might cause frustration for the impatient ones, but this is not the case. The film gave us several breathtaking closer shots of the MUTOs to keep us entertained before the big guy comes in. It builds up the anticipation for the climax. At the same time, these shots give us a sense of scale, an understanding of monsters' massive sizes before the climatic battle begins. Otherwise, an overexposure of monsters earlier in the film might leave the audience feel exhausted and develop repetitive feeling of scenes as the film progresses. I was genuinely awestruck during the moment when godzilla first appears on-screen, stomping on buildings and makes his first roar.The monsters remain as the central story that ties many of the human characters together in the film. Gone are the silly, cheesy acting, lame humor, and tone of the 1998 version. The level of seriousness in the film gives the sense of urgency and danger for events that about to happen. First, we get to see the Ford family and how the existence of these monsters affect their lives, the research team that tries to understand the creatures behaviour, the Navy troops that tries to stop these creatures from wiping out the entire human race. These stories works together as a functional narrative that connects all the pieces (although it feels contrived and too convenient at some point).The acting was good. Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche and Elizabeth Olsen all provide decent performances in their respective roles. Bryan Cranston delivered a brilliant on-screen performance despite his limited screen time in the film. However, Aaron Taylor- Johnson's character does fall a bit flat and it's a shame that he has most of the screen time compared to the rest of the casts.Overall, Godzilla is an awe-inspiring spectacle that delivers. The climatic battle in San Francisco is truly rewarding and worth the wait, it left me wanting for more.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-godzilla.html Rating: 8/10",8,4,9,15 May 2014
Her," A thought provoking love story that examines human relationships
","Ever heard of a program speak of love? Most people would say no, arguing that it's a human emotion. All of us, regardless of our gender, age, social or marriage status...crave love, the feeling that allows us to find and connect with someone to spend our life with, to relieve us from feelings of loneliness. Her is a sci-fi romantic drama comedy film about an unconventional love story between an introverted, lonely writer named Theodore and an A.I. who calls herself Samantha.Samantha, a self-aware digital consciousness created from an interactive operating system (OS1), has the ability to communicate in human language, able to learn new things and evolve through experience and self-reflection, is sentient and capable of loving, has a good sense of humour, attentive and responsive, has creative and artistic skills, is compassionate and able to comprehend other people's feelings. Though she only exists through an earpiece and a small, hand-sized computer, her presence is strongly felt, as if she is really side-by-side with Theodore as they go on a date or on the bed together. As the film progresses, their relationship deepens and it raises some disturbing, thought-provoking questions: Is Samantha considered to be a conscious, living being? If she's not, could you name any single cognitive ability humans have that she doesn't? Other than that, the film also provides a thoughtful examination on human relationships in a not-too-distant future that's not that different from us.Is it true that technology can never substitute the authenticity of human interaction? How much of love is emotional and how much of it is physical?Joaquin Phoenix provided a splendid convincing performance in conveying his character's loneliness, isolation and sadness, his newfound feelings of hope and love with a co-star who's not even there. His expression felt believable and authentic. Although it's only a voice-over role, Scarlett Johansson need to convince the audience that her presence is felt throughout the film, to convey all her feelings, emotions and personality just by talking.The film provides a deep look at what love really means and how it feels to be in love.This is a well-made great film to watch. Highly recommended. Love is just a word. What matters is the connection the word implies..What you would give to hold on to that connection.Rating: 9/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/01/movie-review-her.html'Sometimes I think I have felt everything I'm ever gonna feel.

The Great Gatsby," The Great Gatsby a visually stunning, captivating, intriguing age-old classic
","The Great Gatsby a visually stunning, captivating, intriguing age-old classic tragic love story originally written as a book by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It tells a story which sets in the Roaring Twenties before The Great Depression...about New York society and the decadence of that era, the wild excesses and emptiness (the Prohibition and bootlegging of alcohol), the glitzy and glamorous parties and plot twists that shows that after all these years, the current generation still facing the same social problems like their predecessors in the 20s.The cinematography, makeup and costume designs were brilliant. The film succeeds in portraying every manner of Gatsby's extravagance. The sets are great, the music is amazing and the costume and fashion style depicted in the film seems to reflect the 1920's. It seems to show how two individuals, not from a wealthy background can easily be deceived by the empty lie of self-gratification.The film also carefully depicts how obsession and wealth can also blind individuals in love: Gatsby's obsession with Daisy and Daisy's obsession with wealth and status despite his love for Gatsby. As Gatsby's true identity and intentions finally revealed in the second half of the movie, one can't help but to sympathize with the hopeless romantic...it is his passion, false optimism, hope and undying love for Daisy which ultimately leads to his own demise.Gatsby has led his entire life in trying to earn and win the love of Daisy, but Daisy is just too afraid to lose the kind of life she has grown up with, to love the one guy her heart calls her to...even though she knows that her husband is cheating on her. It is deeply heartfelt to watch as Nick was unable to stop the dreadful chain of events that he eventually feels responsible for. Once again, Leonardo DiCaprio proved himself as a credible actor by delivering a charismatic, heartbreaking performance as Gatsby. He's done a wonderful job in personifying the character's insecurities, despite his stylish and charming outer appearance. The scene where Daisy and Gatsby reunite together again at Nick's house after 5 years is both awkward and hilarious.I haven't read the book, which is considered a classic literature by many...and I'm not a fan of F. Scott Fitzgerald, therefore I'm reviewing the film based on what I've seen on screen. In my opinion, it is a film that I would recommend others to watch.Rating: 8/10",8,0,2,15 March 2014
Furious 7," A film that has high entertainment value, delivers on all fronts and a brilliant last ride for Paul Walker.
","The Fast & Furious series is back again with its seventh latest 'furiouser' installment, Furious 7. The series has changed a lot over the years...first about illegal street racing in Los Angeles, then a serious heist thriller and now a global spy thriller. (Yes, you heard me! The gang are now turned into international secret military operatives!) Over the years, the franchise has always been delivering on what they promised: bombastic action, hot babes in bikinis and lots of sports cars... with recent installments more focused on the main characters, making each of them individually defined enough to be easily recognized on screen.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2015/04/movie-review-furious-7.htmlThis film is also director James Wan's (mostly directed horror films like Saw, The Conjuring, Insidious) first go at the franchise, and there are subtle changes compared to the last four films, which were previously helmed by Justin Lin (who's moved on to direct the next Star Trek film). Needless to say, this has got to be the most epic, extravagant, ridiculous yet jaw-dropping, action-packed, emotional film in the franchise. In this film, the team tries to take down the dangerous ex-black ops British terrorist Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the brother of Owen Shaw (the villain in the previous installment, played by Luke Evans) who comes for revenge. In order to find and track him down, they need to assist in securing a kidnapped hacker from a terrorist group.The film is constantly filled with tension and excitement despite its slightly long running time (2 hours and 20 minutes). The impressive, absurd yet glorious stunt-filled action sequences featured in this film will definitely keep the audience glued to the screen. They able to both match and even top the efforts of its previous installments. Aside from the usual sport cars that many viewers of the franchise used to be seeing in the past, there are more luxurious supercars being used this time around: Bugatti Veyron, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Maserati, Lamborghini, and the exclusive $3.4 million Lykan HyperSport. There are also a few comic relief scenes with Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as well to relief some of tension between the action sequences.The team have good chemistry with each other and the film does have a plot, albeit a simple one. As usual, Vin Diesel still bring his 'alpha' leadership to the team, Paul Walker as his right-hand man with life experiences as an FBI agent, Michelle Rodriguez as his racing support/lover-'miss alpha', Dwayne Johnson as the team's 'muscle man support'/connection to the police, Chris Bridges as the tech guy, Tyrese Gibson as the comic relief. There's also a new female addition to the team, Ramsey, a highy attractive hacker who's also the key to the film's MacGuffin. The inclusion of Thai martial artist Tony Jaa (Ong Bak) and mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey (The Expendables 3) also add flavour to the close-combat fight action scenes in the film as well.However, the film is not without its problems. The franchise's biggest problem has always been the lack of compelling, memorable villains. The same can be said for this one as well. There are two villains this time around and they were constantly sidelined most of the time by each other and the big action sequences. The characters are not well developed enough, which is a waste. There are some plot contrivances here and there and some dialogues in certain scenes are particularly cheesy and corny, which I think viewers of the franchise would get used to them by now.The film also provides the audience a nice sendoff and tribute to Paul Walker at the end. Another major problem for the film is the tragic untimely death of Paul Walker during the film production (everyone should know by now that Paul died in a car accident last year halfway through filming), which forced the studio to hire Walker's brothers to step in and that CGI would be used for his face and voice. All in all, the film has high entertainment value, delivers on all fronts and a brilliant last ride for Paul Walker.",8,3,6,3 April 2015
