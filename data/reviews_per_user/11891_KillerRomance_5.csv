Blade Runner 2049," Elvis in the future? Seriously?
","The first Blade Runner movie is set in Los Angeles in the year 2019 (not far off) with Rick Deckard (Ford) as the first Blade Runner.
The en noir science fiction is back but this time set thirty years later and we have Agent K (Ryan Gosling) as the new Blade Runner to find Rick Deckard.The dialogue is well-written and well scripted but the plot was slow-moving and it was all over the place, whereas the original was more fluid and focused, Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah seemed human and developed sagacious insight which is both scary and touching. In Blade Runner 2049 there are good guys and bad guys, that's it! That's all, nothing else.
The movie wants to dazzle us with the idea that no trees exist in Los Angeles except a golden retriever dog is around in the future and it is nothing but neon lights. The visuals are impressive as the original nevertheless. 
The whole notion of China or Japan being the forefront in food distribution and advertisement is extraordinary and not far from the truth.
However this is what cracks me up completely - the Music! What I don't get is why is the music so ancient and whitewashed? 
I can't imagine anyone playing Frank Sinatra, can you? The writer is probably an Elvis Presley fan whom the idol gets more screen time in the fighting scene also when a cameo appearance isn't better enough to be placed there like cotton wool, just there for no reason. Elvis in the future? Are you kidding me? I am very sure that Freddy Mercury and Michael Jackson the true King and the Mozart of our time had more impact to be remembered in the year 2049.
I am not an Elvis fan can't you tell? 
I will be 71 years old when that time comes and I will make sure to play greatest Artists that shake the world.",3,13,26,18 June 2018
Meet Joe Black," Worst movie ever please take it to the gallows
","Outlined plot is Anthony Hopkins getting distracted by the voice of death, and realises more meets the eye when he comes across Brad Pitt as an animated corpse possessed​ by Death, then Pitt is smitten with the Daughter which causes problems.I don't mean to be rude but how on earth did this movie get the go ahead to be created for production? What is the point to it despite making people bored to death (pardon the pun). Anthony Hopkins is absolutely wasted in this movie and such an incredible actor that doesn't deserve to be in this mess. Jake Weber from American Gothic did do a good performance but even he can't save the movie, because the whole movie dialogue and weak slow plot is terrible. I read some reviews saying 'oh don't get me wrong, Brad Pitt is attractive' for speaking the truth on how bad the film is, well I never found Brad Pitt attractive but I do appreciate interview with the Vampire, a river runs through it, Seven, and Kalifornia that illustrates good performances (even if he can't get rid of his lisp in each movie, watch out for the word 'finish' and you will hear it), Meet Joe Black is a drivel mess. There is nothing meaningful​ in the movie or heartfelt about it, accept necrophilia between Brad and the CEO's Daughter (last movie like that was Weekend at Bernies but it sucks and we forgave it for being a comedy, this is a serious drama for goodness sake!) All you see is Pitt that turned into a boring zombie without bruises, isn't like the charming so and so at the coffee shop, that gorges on peanut butter that isn't old as time, stuffs his face like an infant, and mimics a weird Jamaican accent who might become a murder suspect to our Anthony and if not careful. I am not one of those gullible females fortunately, that is what makes judgement easy for me on this lame film. The only thing good is the photography and lighting but when it boils down to it, the movie is dead, just like the gazes and stares the actors give to each other in this nonsense. Forget it.",1,1,7,1 April 2017
The Dark Knight," Overrated, overhyped and too much praise.
","Heath Ledger's joker is stupid and the most overhyped actor and movie in history by miserable kids. . Open beginning scene in broad daylight in Gotham with worst clown make up ripped off Brandon Lee's The Crow along with holding a mask waiting to get picked up by bank robbers.... passersby don't pay no attention at a weird damn clown like really!?! Tim Burton's Gotham is like the comic books.. it's gloomy, dark, full of gargoyle statues .. but in the dark knight it's always Sunny. Also the pencil trick is the most dumbest scene ever, no blood from the eye and Heath who is no Mr Muscle wrestled an angry black guy and for the pencil to stick on Blu Tak or bubblegum for it to stick upright and go all the way to the eye socket is pathetic. Even Hedge Leather can be pinned by the mobsters with guns to shoot him..the end, but they didn't kill him. Also what kind of Joker is he to not get excited by blowing things up and not have fun?...Boring! Also get away in a slow assed pace in a nurse uniform on a bus where cops could seal the area!?!
Heath Ledger's character is like an emo teen that is too high on weed without a plan, Jack Nicholson's Joker had a plan, the Penguin had a plan, Jim Carrey's Riddler had a plan, but Heath's joker doesn't have a plan, he is all over the place like diarrhea. The scene where Joker burnt the money is ripped off from quote by Donnie Darko to his Teacher Drew Barrymore, and this so-called edgy emo HL's Joker that is burning money is not a landslide when zillions of other paper money is all over the country, plus he brought a tailored purple suit with mobster cash, and he doesn't care about Money? LOL sure! Whatever. Jack Nicholson still rules, his face looks like a comic book character even without the make up.
The world's most overhyped movie ever.",1,4,14,14 November 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Stunning movie not ISIS motivated, doesn't promote domestic violence, nor anti gay but Emma Watson was no Belle of the ball
","First of all, my review won't be like one commenter from Japan who declared that the movie is 'anti-gay' when the movie finally portrays a Homosexual character (that some reviewers find it hard to accept gay people exist), or as she pointed out the Enchantress is like ISIS in Syria because of punishing a smug Prince and his guests, dear me! If she watched the animation that has the same 'ISIS' concept then she lost the plot. Including nonsense about Stockholm Syndrome, when it is about two people developing a soul and connection in each other, or one reviewer said it 'promotes domestic violence'. Don't watch it with your inane sensitivity and warped crazy logic. Simple as that! So on to the Review. The Cartoon animation of Beauty and the Beast (1991) was one of my favourite Disney movies besides The Lion King. The movies back then capture your heart and imagination and all ages find this appealing.Since Cinderella the Disney movies become real life motion pictures with a touch of Magic, or well made CGI. Cinderella was amazing.Now Beauty and the Beast has this same treatment, there is a more detailed introduction than the animation about Prince Adam who is handsome but vain and turned cruel, and the Beautiful Enchantress that disguised as a Hag in offering a Rose, had put him under a spell as a Mephistopheles hulking looking creature, along with everyone inside the palace, including the Guests which became a enchanting prison.Years passed when 17 year old well read Belle (Watson) is pursued by Gaston (Luke Evans) until her Papa (Kevin Kline) is caught captive during his Journey into a mysterious Castle. She pursued after him with the help of the Family Horse 'Philippe' to embark risk and fate.In this Movie, a lot of famous dialogue was refrained in respect of the original masterpiece, which is a good thing. Some of the cast did a good job, Gaston, Lefou are the best characters and Plummette is beautiful and probably should have played Belle, because when I heard Emma Watson was chosen I wasn't that excited she seemed more tomboyish, Belle in animation is the prettiest Disney Princess and I imagined Leah Pipes, Emma Roberts, or even a girl like Lana del Rey that looks like a doll and full rosebud mouth if you catch my drift, and Belle was supposed to be quirky and well-read but Emma Watson wasn't at all. Years ago Disneywords on Twitter suggested Anne Hathaway as real life Belle which was a good choice as I saw 'the Devil wears Prada' so what went wrong? She is still young enough and gorgeous.However I love the special effects on the characters and rococo 18th century french setting which I did enjoy, the CGI wolves are okay, maybe the movie makers don't want to use real wolves for some reason. The end credits have a golden Hollywood feel, it is like you come out of the opera House and you buy a DVD of the musical play and it is set up especially for you.My overall reaction it was enjoyable and love both the Animation in the 1990's and this movie, glad to see there are some African actors in the village because they did exist in France in that era, but I wished they didn't pick Emma Watson because she is nothing like the Cartoon nor has warmth as the original Belle.One more thing, lighten up it is only a fairy tale, don't get political and personal about it.",7,2,8,27 July 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," The BEST Movie ever made
","As me and my Boyfriend watched this movie on Valentine's Day, None of Us knew what to expect. We heard all the Good and Negative reviews, but out of curiosity we checked it out, and plus it looks great on the Trailer.Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) a virginal and Pretty English Literature Student had a twist of meeting her Destiny in the form of Handsome but Troubled Billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), and then as they dig deeper into each other, the more they get into a passionate Sexual Love Affair. Sooner or later, Christian tells Ana a dark Secret that he has different taste in Sex, and under many discussions, exclusions and making compromises for the sake of their Love, they go through so much to make their relationship work. Then the roles switch by Surprise. It was Ana who is in Total control, and Christian who is the vulnerable one, she finally breaks him as soon as he is shown the importance of Intimacy.It is a modern love story of two different people reaching a compromise, and unlike other love stories of two people without not a single dysfunction or flaws. I had been a long term victim of violent assault in the past and lived in a woman's refuge (and recovered from trauma of being manually choked, punched, kicked, broken bones, plus getting my job back, and found a private apartment at the same time.)This is not a movie about abuse, nor is this movie about rape, there is no forceful sex, but about two consented Adults. The movie is classy, and very Sexy love story, with humorous moments. The script is like watching a beautiful visual book, Both Dakota and Jamie do have amazing sexual chemistry, that goes with the music score and soundtrack. The Beautful Dakota Johnson is an amazing and bold Actress, and Jamie Dornan IS Christian Grey, There is something about Irish Men not just only down to earth, but they are the most beautiful men I ever laid my eyes on. And because of that, I decided to watch the movie the second time by myself. I've been talking about Jamie a lot lately and my Boyfriend is giving me Clint Eastwood looks, so I will watch Jamie when he isn't looking ;pHowever we both enjoyed this movie and we saw it with an open mind. This Movie had everything, great plot, mesmerising script, heartbreaking moments, comedy, intense sexual passion, steamy love scenes, including kinky with rough and tumble sexual foreplay, great acting, great photography, good directing, amazing soundtrack and music score; what is not to like? Except leaving you the need to watch it again, it is that fantastic. Leaves you wanting more, keeps you smiling for days; what a truly unforgettable and enjoyable Film. The Best Movie I ever seen in my life. I look forward to seeing the sequels fifty shades Darker and Fifty shades Freed. I also ordered the DVD, and now got the Book Trilogy. 10/10",10,8,24,23 February 2015
