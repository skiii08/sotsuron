Ali," Boring.... no direction... Indecisive...
","The potential for the movie was obvious from the beginning. A great story about an important person for his time....and for the sport...and for the political stands...and for the religion...and so on. But the movie does not succeed the capture of the mood, the person(s), the time, the sport, the fights, the excitement... and does not live up to the promise of being an exciting, explosive action/drama... Will Smith's performance was average and not Convincing. The length of the movie could have been cut to a third without jeopardizing the essence of the story. Much too long and non-productive scenes which tries to capture the historical and cultural aspects of the period... Sorry...no good.",4,0,1,16 May 2005
