Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great disappointment
","A great disappointment. Lucas merely repeats his past. Little about this movie makes it worth seeing on the big screen. Indeed, it may not even be worth renting. The plot is a re-hash (or a jumble, perhaps) of the original three movies.There are also a number of character portrayals that border on being ethnic and/or racial slurs, to put it kindly. Considering the talent George Lucas has, it seems unfortunate that he would choose to debase it in this way.",1,1,3,23 June 1999
Catch Me If You Can," A good, old-fashioned movie!
","After my disappointment with Spielberg's recent efforts, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Just a nice, old-fashioned fifties-style movie about a little larceny. Even the opening credits, reminiscent of the Pink Panther animation, let you know that this movie is going to be different. I could have taken my mother and not been embarrassed--and that's pretty rare these days.Although I might quibble a bit with some of the flashing forward and backward that makes the story a little confusing, this was an enjoyable film overall--nice cast, great score, good location filming, mostly accurate sixties period details. If you're not a self-appointed movie critic but like good movies for their own sake and aren't just looking to find fault, you can enjoy this story and leave the theater without feeling that you got taken.",9,0,1,25 January 2003
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Two hours wasted
","It's hard to believe Universal would have invested money in this movie. Regrettably, I wasted two precious hours of my life on it. Lesson learned: don't bother with movies from Universal. Try to look for something from a studio with some redeeming social value.Though there are some 'funny' scenes here, if you are thinking only of your own c--k, there's really nothing here to keep your attention, assuming you have even a small brain. Otherwise, go for it. This is a great film for people who need to hear all the forbidden words shouted out in a large movie theater so they can laugh nervously about the things they would never say.In the end, it's sad to see that Universal has had to stoop to such low depths to find a script/film worth releasing. Perhaps it's time they stopped trying.PS--For those of you who thought this was a good/great/funny movie: you have a sad future in store for you.",1,22,43,5 July 2006
Meet the Fockers," Good cast; bad script; great disappointment
","It's really astonishing that stars of this caliber would agree to appear in such a low-class film. Reminds me of the days when great stars lost their luster and started doing cheap commercials. When that occurred, you could always figure that they had spent all their money and were desperate. While I don't think that's the case with Hoffman or Streisand, that's what it looked like to me. This was a poorly written story with a bad script, and no matter how many times a joke or two came across, I always felt as though I was watching a great cast performing below my expectations. Apparently, the money was good. I'm very disappointed with Streisand, Hoffman, and Deniro for agreeing to put up with such nonsense.",1,1,2,20 June 2005
Love Actually," A pleasant surprise!
","Movies disappoint me so often that I wasn't expecting much from this one, but I really enjoyed it. The unusually long climax to the story is a refreshing ten minutes or so of great moviemaking. It restored my faith in the ability of the film industry to produce good movies, and so I wholeheartedly recommend it.",10,0,1,7 December 2003
