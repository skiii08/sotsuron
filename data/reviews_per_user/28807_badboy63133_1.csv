The Rock," An awesome action movie about two men on a mission to save a city from destruction.
","This movie is my favorite movie of ALL TIME. For guys and gals that like a good action, thats laced with humor this is the movie for you. Its a powerful, emotional, original, awesome action movie. It has three well known actors who play eccentric characters very well. Unlike other actions, it doesn't really have many OBVIOUS mistakes or plot holes. And its not one of those movies thats all about people shooting people (although there is a lot of that :P). It has a good storyline and for those that aren't that fussed on car chases (i know my mother isn't), there is really only one in the movie. Its got the most powerful feel to it which is conveyed through highly emotional music that will send ya ears to another world!It has an intense climax and a small twist at the end as well. Now i may be making a bit more of a deal than i should about this but i don't care. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I Don't CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS. If you absolutely hate actions then maybe this movie isn't for you but otherwise its THE BEST action classic for a long time. WATCH IT. Don't SAY MAYBE. SAY YES. $4 at the video shop ain't that much is it?",10,2,3,18 September 2006
