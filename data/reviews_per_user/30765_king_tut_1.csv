The Devil's Advocate," Hobbled by offensive ending...
","I really dug this film, even with some of its flaws.  But the last 5 minutes of this film are so heinous that they totally demolish the whole film.  No spoilers here, but you'll recognize the scene when you see it.  It looks like it was added after test screenings found the original ending too dark. I suddenly felt stupider for having watched the whole thing.  It actually made me mad.",Null,0,1,6 November 2002
