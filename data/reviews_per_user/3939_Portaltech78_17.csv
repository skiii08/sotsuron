The Avengers," Not perfect, but good
","I, like many others, was waiting for this movie to come out, after all those previews at the end of the credits in several movies like Thor, Iron man etc. I have to admit they did a very good promoting of this movie, It made me want to see it more and more.First of all don't get me wrong this IS a very action packed and enjoyable movie you should see on the big screen. I just think the story line was lacking and some characters was not up for this job and should have been left out like Samuel Jackson (Nick Fury),Clint Barton (Hawkeye) and Loki looked weak and his pointy scepter he had was a ridicules prop that appeared weak and fragile. The rest of the cast was excellent, especially Iron man, Black Widow.",9,5,12,4 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Very good indeed
","A must see, I saw the first one and thought it was going to be boring during the first several minutes, but I stuck it out and gave it a 7. This is definitely a strong 8 and I really was going to give it a 9.This movie is sad then funny then happy. One thing for sure you will not be disappointed. Although this might not be the Sherlock Holmes you new from reading old books from the past, it's still very much entertaining. I read a Sherlock Holmes book years ago while in elementary school and loved it. Now what are you waiting for? Go out and see this movie. Sorry IMDb I can't right",8,0,1,5 May 2012
Iron Man 3," But why? Why?
","Why did they have to go and screw a good thing up? I mean this was boring and hardly any good action scenes. The first two Iron Man's was good, this one not so good.Robert Downey Jr. was not his best , he is so much better.It's definitely not worth paying for in a theater.Wait till your friend rents it and see it for free.I sure hope they get Jon Favreau to be part of part four, I think that might have been the reason this Iron Man was not up to par.Can't wait for the next 'Avengers'Sincerely,IMDb loyal member",6,0,1,26 May 2013
A Star Is Born," Nice movie
","This was a great movie, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga was awesome. Get ready for some tears.",8,0,2,22 January 2020
The Hunger Games," Highly Overrated
",This movie is nice but highly overrated. I can tell you that the first 20 minutes are so/so the next 10-15min are no/no And the rest good except the ending. That about sums it all up. Maybe the only people giving this good ratings are kids and fans of the Book. I fell asleep after the first 20min and had to watch it the next day.Do your self a favor and wait for it on TV or something. Trust me you would not want to pay over 10 dollars and who knows how much on soda and popcorn for this.Hey give it a try. But I wouldn't pay full movie price or DVD price for it.,7,2,3,12 August 2012
The Notebook," I hate this movie!
","It happen again! I first watched this movie way back around 2005. I forgot all about it, today I was looking for something to watch and came across 'The Notebook' boy did I make a BIG mistake Again! The writer, director and producer should all be held liable....a law suit should be filed against them for ALL the pain and suffering they have caused me and no doubt many others!I failed to remember all the tears that came running down my face before, but I was quickly reminded this time again. This movie is very emotional. To the Writer, producer and director....thank you for such a lovely movie.... I'm just mad because Now I have to pay for an appointment with a therapist so I can stop sobbing.In summary It really is a great movie but very emotional so get ready for the waterfalls coming from your eyes...by the way see it with a girl, then you can get to first base by comforting her while she is crying!",8,0,1,26 April 2012
Underworld Awakening," Why so many user ratings giving10's?
","Please don't get me wrong I love the Underworld movies and I absolutely love Kate Beckinsale especially how they make her eyes look soo blue. This movie was also good but I have to point out what I consider flaws. First, the two guns which shoots about 100 bullets in 3 seconds needs to get reloaded a lot more than they did in this movie, I mean it got to a point where I said, 'Really?' Second they did some unbelievable things here like when David (Theo James)died she went into his stomach and squeezed his heart and it restarted? How about ALL the other dead vampires around him? Why not squeeze their hearts? By the way Davids acting was not good. In this one she seemed to have to much strength but then when she could have use it she didn't. Now to her daughter... I like the concept of the girl but she was a little to creepy, she kinda looked like a cross between the scary girl from the 'The Ring' (2002), 'The Grudge'(2004) and a vampire. I also could not help but notice that the whole script reminded me of 'Resident Evil'Well this is why I gave it 7 stars. The first 'Underworld' is still the best worth 9 stars.",7,3,6,1 February 2012
Man of Steel," Super Dull
","No way this movie should get anywhere pass a 7 and that's being nice.If you never knew the meaning of 'Lot's of action with no action' This movie would be the perfect example.Meaningless action, just throwing each other to one side of the camera and then to the other side.No story line. Superman is colder than ice. There is no real action with meaning. No humor, Just plain old no frills Superman.Do your self a favor and save your money, Or better yet rent yourself a Christopher Reeves Superman part 1 and 2, you will enjoy that much more.",6,3,7,30 June 2013
We're the Millers," Funny, Funny and more funny!
","Have to admit, I never thought Jason Sudeikis was that funny, But this movie changed my mind.This family came together and made me laugh a lot. Jennifer Aniston is her usual great self. It was not just a comedy it was a pretty well written story as well.If you love comedy's I think you will love this one. My philosophy is don't expect to much going into the movie and you should be fine. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, you'll love it! Why you still on this review? Go watch it!",9,0,1,16 September 2013
1917," NOT a action war movie
","I thought this movie would show some action, there was none. I was very disappointed. Watched the whole thing hoping to see some military fighting, but none. This is Truly a waste of time movie.",2,3,16,22 January 2020
Avatar," One Of The Best!
","Just the Colors and Beautiful scenes will leave your mouth open.This movie is one of my all time greats as the story is wonderful and cinematography is rich with once again Beautiful scenes and COLOR!. Go and see this one as you won't regret it! I had to also by this in Blu-Ray as that is the best way to see this awesome movie! I don't know why they make you write 10 lines on IMDb, I think 5 lines is sufficient for a review especially when you don't want to contain any spoilers. I think they want 10 lines to discourage anyone from writing comments that are useless or just wanting to spam. Anyhow this movie is a MUST BUY! BUY THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IN BLU-RAY HD TV!",10,1,5,4 July 2010
There Will Be Blood," There WILL be Snoring
",I am REALLY starting to think people are creating many bogus accounts just to bring up ratings in a lot of these movies now on IMDb. I have never seen so many ratings and reviews on here saying 'The movie is the best! A master piece!' Turns out it is by far the most boring movie I had ever seen. look at my history of ratings and you can see I give credit where credit is due. I truly know a good movie when I see one and this movie is definitely not one of the good movies around! If you rent this movie get ready to fall asleep within 30 minutes. Something is really fishy here on IMDb that all these bad movies are getting good reviews. I think IMDb should start screening users more better.,1,5,12,5 July 2011
X-Men: First Class," Disappointing
","This is a very disappointing movie to me. I loved all the X-Men movies. Not nice enough and maybe would have put me to sleep. The characters here was awfully dull and not one bit exciting. I expected a lot more action and wolverine did the right thing by telling them to ...Off. X-Men and X-Men 2 was the best If there other X-men are like this forget about it making money. X men 3 was OK. True die hard X-Men addicts will not like this at all. Next one better be a whole lot better than this! I hope they did not spend too much on this one because I don't think they will even break even, But then again just because of there other X-Men alone will bring people.",6,0,5,19 June 2011
Ben-Hur," Not all that
","What's the big fuss over this movie? It actually put me to sleep.
The Ten Commandments is sooo much better than this.",6,0,2,12 April 2020
Pitch Perfect," Feel Good Movie!
","Where do I start..... Hmm, this movie really surprised me, in a very good way. I loved the way they was singing, I loved the way they acted.Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy in movie) I think is a funny rising actress.Anna Kendrick is so adorable, I fell in love with her cute style of acting in the very good movie '50/50' she played a psychologist.This movie 'Pitch Perfect' will leave you with a smile. I truly enjoyed it and recommend it for all to see. The movie won't be a classic but it's definitely a good enough movie to pay to see.",9,3,7,11 December 2012
300," This is a gem!
","Absolutely a good movie to see, Love the Spartans!
I think the battles was just extraordinary, also like the way it almost looks animated.
THIS IS SPARTA! Had to say that.",8,2,2,16 January 2019
The Fighter," Walhberg A Surprise for me
",Never heard of these real life fighters in the movie...Oh how I now want to!! This movie is a surprise HIT for me... I loved Walhberg in this movie. He was great and his brother and girlfriend was good too. This movie felt real... I mean I lived in Chelsea MA for 5 years and it's funny how these people reminded me of lots of people I knew. His family had me laughing the way they acted.This movie is definitely a must see! I'm kinda glad I didn't know the history of these fighters because then I would have known the end. This movie is a pleasant surprise. I like Walhberg but didn't consider him a great actor. While his acting is not Oscar material it is definitely much better than lots of others.,9,1,2,23 January 2011
