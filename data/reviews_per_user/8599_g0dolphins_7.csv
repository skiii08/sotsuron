National Treasure: Book of Secrets," National Treasure: Book of Boredom
","This movie pales horribly in comparison to the original. There were plenty of F/X throughout, but those couldn't hold the movie together alone. Dialog was forced, attempts at humor failed miserably (I recall a majority of the theater laughing twice), and I found myself looking forward to the end with more than an hour to go. A day's worth of reflection after going to the theater and there is nothing that compels me to change my review.2 points worth mentioning. 1). For those who do enjoy the franchise, a vague arc is presented for a potential third installment. 2). The audience was treated to a 10-12 minute Goofy cartoon before the movie began. While pleasant and enjoyable enough, it wasn't worth the price of admission.",4,4,8,2 January 2008
Star Trek," HARD CORE fans beware: 1 Spoiler I wish I had been aware of
","I really don't want to say anything more than this: If you are a hard core trek fan BEWARE. Beware as this movie creates an alternative universe whose time-line is left wide open at the end. Also beware that in terms of the canon, this movie has taken several liberties with characters that I think would not have been possible if Roddenberry were alive.Because of these factors I cannot even really rate this movie. What I can do though is go as far as to REJECT it. Other hard core fans at work that have seen this are also quite vocal about their disappointment.IMDb is requiring that I add more content, so I guess I should say that the movie was thrilling while I watched it, but I kept hoping that in the end, some event would occur and restore the original time line and Roddenberry universe that has evolved these last 43 years. That didn't occur. In just two hour's time the history we love and revere has disappeared like a fart in the wind.I type this one day after having watched it and I become more and more aggravated at this bastardization of the canon. My frustrations is enough that I probably will tell everyone I know to avoid this movie for the love of all that is the Federation.",1,35,82,11 May 2009
No Country for Old Men," Coen Bros never cease to amaze
","Similar to the comments made by many others here who like the body of work by the brothers Coen, No Country for Old Men is an excellent addition. It is one of those rare movies that I dwell on for days, thinking back on the movie and further contemplating what I experienced: the breath taking imagery, the dialog, the way the scene was filmed, etc. It was a movie that dazzled the senses and engrossed the intellect. There are ample areas that could be discussed as to why this is flick is getting such high ratings here on the IMDb (I give it 10 out of 10, and there are very few movies that I would rate as such). As I have read the comments, many of them seem to be for all the right reasons. In summary: -TLJ certainly provided probably his best work ever as a supporting actor -Javier Bardem (who?) portrayed a most vile yet mesmerizing and memorable psychopath -Josh Brolin gave a solid performance as a man who only wanted to improve his lot in the world -Sensational supporting cast -The score (or lack thereof) was brilliantly woven into the story that unfolded -The imagery that we all come to expect from the Coen's -Oscar nominations for both Coen brothersHowever, one thing that I keep dwelling upon that I have not yet seen comments about is the randomness that permeated every aspect of this movie. True, the violence certainly had an in your face random quality throughout, but many parts of life seemed to have a random quality to it as well. One is left to wonder just how much of life is random, ranging from the joys and positive experiences we all encounter to the absolute horror that would possibly be experienced if such violence were to be thrust upon us. Certainly No Country For Old Men will also stand the test of time, it will for me at any rate. That translates into making the short list of Must See Classics; which means I'll buy it and watch many more times for many years to come.",10,6,15,13 November 2007
Black Hawk Down," A MUST see for those who served since the Reagan era
","While other recent movies about war have been heralded as epic and masterpieces, BHD brought to the front of my mind memories of my enlisted days in the mid - late 80s like no other film (distant second being the 'hard ass' drill instructor in Full Metal Jacket during boot camp).  True, this movie is not for the faint of heart, and true, the action sequences will leave you gasping and gut wrenched over the duration of the film. But what I took away from it the most was Scott's capture of many of the subtleties one would encounter in field conditions in today's modern military:  The field kitchen scenes, an enlisted man 'packing' his can of Copenhagen (has this ever been captured on film before?  We all dipped either Cope or Skoal), gathering around a VCR, killing time in a hanger with nothing better to do than imitate the quirky perks of the brass.  Even the dialect and language.  `Hoo-ahh'.  We were so ate up that age and time, and Scott captures this perfectly.  Was this borrowed from the book of the same name?  I don't know, but I want to buy it and read it to find out.Is it a great war flick?  You bet it is.  To me, it is an instant classic. I'll probably see it again and then buy the DVD.  Are there any weaknesses? I couldn't think of any.  Great cast, enough character development to sustain the plot, and STUNNING footage.  My only regret (and this has no bearing on the movie whatsoever) is that I didn't realize the events that took place in 1993, and didn't pay more attention to the world political scene at that time.Memorable Scene:  At the very end, when all troops have evacuated the hot zone and are back at base camp.  In the field kitchen, and the conversation is about 'why you did it' (enlist).  I won't give it away, but I have to say that for any guy who served in the military in this period, you'll do your best to 'maintain composure' during and after the scene.10 out of 10",Null,0,0,21 January 2002
Taken," More roles for Liam like this please
","Take an average run of the mill action/revenge plot, throw in some over the top scenes with a bunch of one dimensional bad dudes, and what do you have? Any of the typical Steven/Jean Claude/Dolph films that have been created over the last two decades. But cast Liam as your ultimate bad ass and you have a whole new movie. Liam was rock solid and his performance was one to remember.I've liked Liam in several roles, but never even imagined him in this type of 'out for revenge and bang your dead' performance. It was fantastic. I rate Taken an 8. In the hands of more expected actors (like those listed above) this would have been a 5, 6 at best.Item of Note: This movie was PG13 and for the life of me I don't know how it was given this rating. It should have been R, especially due to an intense torture scene.",8,2,4,3 February 2009
There Will Be Blood," The parts were greater than the whole
","This is a most difficult movie to comment on, and I find it hard to put into words as to the reason. I think I enjoyed the movie, but how, why? Did I enjoy Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal as the leading antagonist? Most defiantly. DDL has provided us with many memorable performances and his role as Daniel Plainview is no less in intensity as was Butcher Bob, nor any less authentic as Nathaniel Poe. Did I enjoy other aspects of the film? Sure! The period piece was of considerable interest; how oil can transform your life, for better, worse or otherwise. The cinematography was beautiful and telling. I fully appreciate the hard, dirty, bone weary work that this occupation would entail. The rag tag day-to-day existence for those working the oil fields, and the land from whence it came. The score too was beautifully blended, adding to the epic scope of the experience. Paul Dano was very convincing too as the prophet/preacher of the small community where Plainview acquires vast tracks of land. His character was equally complex, and I felt he complimented DDL quite adequately. Even the story had many merits, as we came to understand the type of people who produced oil, and how the product of its labor and influence can impact those who were associated with its extraction. So one would think that the buzz and hype around it in February 2008 are worthwhile, yet I cannot seem to agree. There is something missing, something that falls short of the expectations. Too many people are of opposite opinion regarding this movie; it is either a masterpiece or drivel. I find it is neither, although I am much more likely to lean towards the former. For that reason alone I should be what, somewhere five or seven on a scale of 1-10? Perhaps it does, I just wish I could feel it. So should I give it a 7 and stop wasting time lamenting over it? Yes, a 7, for reasons I can explain but not feel confident about. It pains me to do so, therefore I can only conclude that my expectations for this movie were not met.",7,80,151,18 February 2008
Sin City," Like many of the characters, I was blown away
","I find it very hard to describe this movie in a manner that words will do justice. Similar to comic book medium, most of the story is based upon visual format. With that being said, this movie is an absolute orgy for the eyes. Without repeating what most others have previously indicated so eloquently, I'll just add that about 5 minutes into the first scene, I felt like I was in an F-15 Eagle; full after burner ascents, cork screws and under black-out condition g-forces for the next 2 hours SOLID. The ONLY negative was just that. You never get to come up for air, and I felt mentally exhausted (while still exhilarated) after the credits began to role.Two things about this amazing tour de force that really stood out with me: 1). This was the role Rourke was born to play. If he isn't nominated for an Oscar, then something is terribly twisted in Tinsel Town. Again, I can't even begin to describe his portrayal of Marv, other than to say once we recognized him as this character, the screen was simply alive with blistering energy. Then factor in other exceptional performances put in by Del Toro, Alba, Owen, etc., and he still rises head and shoulders above the others. It's going to be remembered as one of the finest anti-hero performances ever. 2). Not too many movies completely pervade my thoughts long into the night. My wife and I had plans afterwards, but all we could do was talk about what we just experienced. NO MOVIE had ever completely occupied my thoughts the following day. I still find myself wickedly drawn to the impressions I'm left with.10 out of 10  my highest praise possible.",10,2,5,11 April 2005
