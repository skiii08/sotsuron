Catch Me If You Can," Unseen Cruelty
","Steven Spielberg has a style, a straight forward telling of a story. There is something middle class and suburban about his films. The temperament of the protagonists, their concerns is essentially middle-class whether the actors are soldiers of D Day or doomed Jews of Europe; their world, the well-to-do burgher world has crumbled. He doesn't write these scripts, but he certainly puts his stamp on them.DiCaprio is very convincing, playing a teen, and then in turn, playing an older man whether doctor or pilot. I think that is a neat trick. I've always thought that actors are the weirdest of all artists and possibly the dumbest in real life, but I digress. Christopher Walken plays the failed businessman-father with the heart of a gentle con. The son takes the con part and leaves behind the gentle. His mother is an opportunist, a French war bride, so when things go wrong, she moves on without a lot of thought or feeling for the men in her life. DiCaprio is attracted to criminality, a 'Paper Hanger,' living in the swinging late 60's with a suitcase full of ill-gotten cash. Tom Hanks, the stodgy FBI man is on his trail, but the boy is just too fast. He can only be caught if he wants to be caught. I digress again. Mr. Spielberg is not Alfred Hitchcock, but he learned a lot from watching Hitch's work. Keep the plot moving by the illusion of unseen cruelty, the shaking chandelier or invisible shark. Hitchcock fans know what I mean.",8,1,2,27 June 2005
Monster," Hard to Swallow
","Charlize Theron, a very beautiful woman plays the 'John Killer' as a gawky, tall retard. She wins an academy award for being consistently foul, goofy, and murderous. I'm assuming there's a certain amount of sympathy here for an abused from cradle female, but her victims were run of the mill lonely-hearts except for an occasional sadist, but hell why get angry when occupational hazard strikes. Get yourself a lawyer like any worker's occupation case plaintiff Christina Ricci, not in Ghost World, but close, plays Charlize's lover. She's rather retarded too. I can't quite place the blue collar Florida malaise that the audience is supposed to understand instinctively. Well, ah, why didn't lonely Ricci go to beautician school and meet some gals of the same persuasion on line. The whole idea that a down-and-out boozer could even interest this young mixed up girl is hard to swallow. Oh, but this is a true-life story. Never mind.",6,0,1,24 July 2006
Shakespeare in Love," Romantic Bard
","The first time I viewed Shakespeare In Love, it was a romantic evening, and I think I got lucky. At my age, I don't always remember. Anyhow, the babe and I thought handsome Joseph Fiennes a romantic young Bard, and his impossible, indeed, star-crossed love, Gwenth Paltrow, delightful. For us fellows that have taken up the pen, Shake is a hero, and we're more than willing to imagine our less talented egos upon the master; therefore, making our pathetic literary dreams come true for at least ninety minutes.The second time around on DVD, ah, a popular Academy Award Winner it still is, but I had more reservations. You see, I began to desire the real thing. I wanted to see the actual play. I loved the set of the old Curtain Playhouse. I wanted to see Romeo and Juliet as the 1946, Olivia production, Henry V, had duplicated a Globe presentation.The problem, a lesser farce has been pinned to a great work of art. It's not the writer, Tom Stoppard's fault. I panned his Brazil, but I give him marks for a clever recreation of olden times and a romanticized Shakespeare, interesting.Oh, Paltrow's hair, long and flowing in her family mansion, short, boy cut on stage, I don't get it. She wears a long hair wig at home? However, later on stage, her long hair is exposed. You couldn't hide all those locks under a short haircut.",8,1,2,14 April 2005
The Aviator," Over Produced Junk
","What in the world happened to Martin Scorsese? Here is the creator of Dog Day Afternoon and Wise Guys, a man considered one of the best of the 1970's Golden Age of Film, but film by film his stuff gets more over produced, less insightful, and more expensive. I saw it coming with Gangs of New York, but somebody keep Leonardo DiCaprio away from this guy. They are awful together and The Aviator is one big expensive, good-looking bore without a soul.In a documentary on Neo-Realism, Italian Post War Cinema, Scorsese claims he started with storyboards as a child, a comic book look that is produced giving the director a visualization of what the film will look like. The trouble with The Aviator, it looks like a storyboard. The replicas and animation of Hugh's weird airplanes almost steal the show, because they are the only interesting thing to look at on screen. Howard Hughes is never fleshed out. At least Kinsey, a recent bio flick tried to show why Kinsey was what he was, but DiCaprio's Hugh's is some kind of freak because his mother talked about diseases while he bathed. There's not enough there Martin. The bulk of the film shows a very young actor with no physical resemblance to Howard Hughes talking big time business and avionics without any back-story on how he became so brilliant out of the crib? The women in Hugh's life are trotted out one by one. He's a cocky guy putting his hand under a cigarette flappers skirt, a rich boy lover for Kathryn Hepburn (She doesn't come off too swell in this version), and Ava Gardner (No wonder Sinatra and Artie Shaw had it easy with this chick after the money-bags geekdom of Hughes). None of these gals are fleshed out other than Hollywood publicity shrek.Don't bother with this one.",3,4,7,27 July 2005
Groundhog Day," Groundhog Is Jesus
","Groundhog Day was a Harold Ramis-Danny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock, IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it, myself included, liked it and smiled on their way out of the theater. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar, and the film is often played on that day in mid-winter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring. Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century. Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis, co-writer of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous gross-comedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus. That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.I read the 2003 New Yorker piece about Ramis. He's Chicago born Jew with no religious training. He is a Hollywood director, actor, and comedy scriptwriter presently studying Buddhism with his second wife. I don't know anything about Danny Rubin other than his version of the script had Andi MacDowell also reliving Groundhog Day along with Murray's Phil, the slimy weatherman for a Pittsburgh TV station. Ramis made the necessary changes and the rest is possibly the greatest non-secular religious experience in American Cinema. The fact that Rabbi's, Ministers, and Priests are showing this film to their parishioners all over the world is a testament to the film's masterful Aristotelian philosophy of redemption and rebirth.There are so many classic comedy bits, lines to remember, and moments of hilarity for a short review but often overlooked is the theme of rescue through learning. Adults are cursed to make the same mistakes over and over again. Every Freudian shrink has heard his patient's repetition of behavior. Every man is trapped by his wiring. Then, sometimes, maybe because of a catastrophic event, a religious insight, or an intelligent evaluation, there is an epiphany. We can't be sure how the application of intelligence, talent, or luck can establish great work, but we must appreciate it when we see it and be the Groundhog.",10,77,136,7 April 2005
National Treasure," Entertainment for the Family
","There is some earnest history lesson and real reverence for American history in this spirited treasure hunt for all ages. There might be a scary moment here and there for young kids, but overall, National Treasure is benign.I've often wondered about Free Masonry, their old history and secret rituals that some Christian groups claim as Satanic. All the better to build a screenplay full of historical side notes about the Founding Fathers; eight including Ben Franklin and George Washington were Masons. Add some historical hocus pocus having to do with Knights Templers, Egyptian Pyramids, and American landmarks; our modern Treasure hunters search through America's most famous documents and historic sites in their quest. This is fine entertainment.",8,1,1,27 June 2005
Wedding Crashers," 19th Century Parlor Farce
","Two hours into Wedding Crashers, Will Farrell appeared as Chazz Reinhold and true comic mastery ensued. Till then, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn struggled to hold up what is essentially a 19th Century parlor farce. Wedding are funny or at least ironic because they promise what is essentially impossible, 'perfect union' between man and woman. As all successful married couples know, divorce or murder is a toilet seat-up-moment away.Farce or screwball comedy introduces stressful situations and cross-purpose motivations amidst a large cast of diverse characters. They bounce off each other as if billiard balls. Wilson and Vaughn crash weddings to bed teary-eyed women in a moment of marital insecurity. The bride has her man, but what of the single gals? They are society's failures. They are also horny; hence, the premise of the film. We laugh at the Senator's family, each one a character except for Owen's new love, Claire. She's like Marilyn in the Munsters, normal, while her nympho sister, Claire's jock-nut fianc√©, the insane-gay-artiste bro, and all the bedded bimbos, are nuts.Hollywood used to produce screwball comedies during the Depression years to cheer folks up. Carole Lombard, Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant and Clark Gable all took a turn at the misunderstandings that create situation comedy, farce. Perhaps we need cheering up again. After all, there is a war going on and your mortgage is astronomical. Slip the DVD in honey and let's have a laugh.",7,1,1,23 February 2006
Blade Runner," Futurama!
","After his Alien success and it was a 1979 revelation in movie special effects, Ridley Scott turns it up another notch to show us what 2019 LA might look like. The art direction is spectacular all right. The concept, which influenced every sci-fi after: mix futuristic fantasy with retro 1930's Fascist architecture, and turn on the strobe lights and fog machine. Give the actors a bag lady wardrobe and a flying car with DeLorean gull wing doors: That's the future kids, well, sort off. The 1979 take on future communications, a phone booth with a TV screen, ha ha ¬ñ no cell phones envisioned.Harrison Ford could give a Sam Spade Futurama performance back then. Today he sleepwalks through his lines. I have never seen a cocky actor disintegrate over time as Ford has declined. After all, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, or Jimmy Stewart played all their parts with gusto into their 70's. Ford was good in one decade.What ever happened to Sean Young? What a knock-out with a sultry voice!",8,1,2,29 June 2006
Donnie Darko," Hamletian
","Donnie Darko is a teen horror film. In addition, it's a teen romance. In addition, Donnie Darko is a Hamletian study in familial relationship. The viewer never really knows whether Donnie, a brilliant high school kid is wacko or completely sane while his adult world is nutty. I particularly liked the scenes with the lady-shrink where under hypnosis Donnie has a self-pleasuring moment. Things can go wrong in those shrink sessions for sure.There are two groups of adults here, the Democrats and the Republicans. Dukakis is smart and thoughtful. Bush 1 is stammering and smarmy. The Physical Education teacher is new-age bunko, book burning, inflexible along with her idol, Patrick Swayze, as the handsome motivational speaker with one message, there's Fear and Love. To contrast, Drew Barrymore plays the really cool young English teacher that gets canned for being too Liberal. Donnie rebels and insists there is a world of grays out there, not black and white. Okay, this is relativism which has it's own critics. I'd go along with the evil Dan Quail idea if it were more developed, but good and evil in Darko is pretty cardboard.I'm not at all sure why Kelly decided it was important to do a 1988 film in 2001. You got me on that one. There's as much political animosity and self-help gobblygook today as there was in the 80's. I can only assume that the 80's was a crucible for the director.Finally, Darko is an incredibly creative film, very interesting to watch visually as things might fall out of the sky at any moment. Donnie walks through life in movie time, effortlessly burning down buildings while his girlfriend sleeps during a movie date. My teen dates were never like that.",8,2,5,1 May 2006
Cinderella Man," No Academy Award?
","This film didn't get a nod for the Academy Award in 2005. The reason, many reasons, but I might sum up Liberal Hollywood's aversion to a conservative manly man, succeeding against all odds in a tough world isn't the same as two less manly men, Truman Capote, race obsessed cops, or an effeminate Transsexual whining about a tough world run by gasp, Bush!!!! Those warm sepia toned 1930's are recreated for us by Ron Howard. Not much fun starving to death is there? Yet Crowe's Braddock, an injured fighter working the docks to support his family, he doesn't cry. He does what he has to do without stealing or sniveling. He is forever optimistic despite all setbacks. He is a beacon of light for his hungry family. This is undoubtedly the Story of Seabiscuit on two legs, but because we are dealing with one of the best film actors in the world, we can empathize readily.Forget Rocky, CM has the best fight scenes I have ever seen. Sure, they are choreographed, but who cares. We really hated Max Baer and Braddock handles the fool, no prob. Thanks for the uplifting, Conservative message, Ron Howard.",8,0,0,29 March 2006
