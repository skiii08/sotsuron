Walk the Line," Wonderful
","Just caught this last night - what to say that hasn't already been said? Phoenix is terrific, a staggeringly good impersonation. Witherspoon can now command the respect to match her box-office earnings with the performance of her career. The script is fresh but very much grounded in reality - the harsh, jagged, glorious reality of Cash and Carter's life stories. And, best of all, the music is powerfully, invigoratingly performed by the co-leads. Even the background and incidental music is a feast for the ears. If it doesn't get your heart a-pumping, it'll get your toes a-tapping. Form a line immediately.",10,0,0,18 February 2006
Ali," A major disappointment...
","Ali was just released in the UK this weekend and I have to say, it was a major disappointment. The movie was like a video compilation of Ali's life from 1964-74 but with (an exceptional) Will Smith taking the part of the main protagonist instead. Nothing new whatsoever. Usually with pretty poor biopics, the recommendation is that only the major fans of the person profiled should go and see it. In this case, however, I would recommend it to all those out there who know little about these incredible years in Ali's life, as it's basically a piece of show-and-tell cinema. Perhaps most disappointing is that this comes from Michael Mann, who in the 90s brought us 'Last of the Mohicans,' 'Heat,' and, 'The Insider,' making him arguably the finest director of the last decade. So let's just hope Ali's a false start to this one.",Null,0,0,23 February 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Pure, unadulterated joy...
","In the cruel, dark world in which we live, it's refreshing to be able to return to the pre-WWII Middle East and relive that crazy adventure you once set out upon all those years ago as a kid, with old pals Indy, Marion and Sallah and Mr Spielberg and Mr Lucas in tow, taking you by the hand to the sound of Mr Williams' outrageously catchy tune. The movies simply do not get more enjoyable than this, and Raiders is a film to be treasured.",10,0,0,30 January 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Second. Best.
","I'm a decade or so too young to remember the cinematic days of the first two Godfather movies, but I bet that when rumours of a sequel first began to circulate, many moviegoers would have doubted the need for it and would have had serious doubts over whether it could possibly do justice to the masterpiece that was the first film.Such sequel let-downs as Jurassic Park II and Die Hard II had sadly all become part-and-parcel of my 1990s moviegoing experience. The only rule of sequels which I was familiar with as I grew up was that they'd almost certainly get progressively worse from movie to movie. So, after loading the cassette for Godfather Part II, can you blame me for hitting the play button on my VCR with some trepidation?Yes you can! I should have known better. The Godfather Part II is such an outstanding movie that, in fact, to call it a sequel to the first movie does it little justice. Call me clichéd, but 'companion piece' is indeed the best way to describe it in relation to the first. In terms of scope and magnitude of its vision, I don't think it has a rival, anywhere.
It is also one of those movies in which every little department is so perfect, that without even one of them, you can imagine the whole thing collapsing.Nothing needs to be said that hasn't already been uttered innumerable times regarding the casting and their respective performances. Pacino and De Niro are simply mesmerising with Duvall, Cazale and Strasberg providing the rock-solid support. Coppola and Puzo's script charts Michael's moral demise so graphically, it almost pains you to think back to the squeaky-clean war hero presented in The Godfather's opening. As for the bold move to write flashbacks, they serve a hugely meaningful purpose throughout the movie and without them, the main storyline wouldn't impact half as much as it does. Nino Rota's music captures in just one theme (that which first appears as the young Vito approaches Ellis Island with fellow asylum-seekers) the grandness and sinking tragedy of this movie, and his incidental music is magnificent without being intrusive.Perhaps the greatest individual plaudit should be reserved for Gordon Willis's cinematography; It captures the mood of the film perfectly and he betters even his work on the original. In itself it could be labelled a Cinematographer's Bible. And anyone who has borne witness to that final shot of the movie will know exactly what I'm talking about, but for now, that's for my fellow sequel-doubters out there to discover. An unparallelled masterpiece.",10,0,0,10 September 2001
Léon: The Professional," No time to waste...
","You ever had this movie that you've meant to see for years and years, heard incredible things about it during all that time, yet never actually had the chance to see it for yourself? Well it's 8 years now since Leon was released, but half an hour ago I finished watching it, and it was worth every second of that wait - what a movie! What - a - movie!!!
The story is bittersweet, the chemistry between Reno and Portman just beautiful. Indeed, with 5 days remaining until the release of the new Star Wars movie, will we ever see such a performance from Natalie Portman again, and at such a young age as well! Jodie Foster's turn in Taxi Driver comes to mind instantly as Portman graces the screen with such astonishing ease and versatility. I must see the Director's cut now...!",Null,0,1,10 May 2002
