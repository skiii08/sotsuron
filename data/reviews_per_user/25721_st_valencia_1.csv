The Longest Yard," Forget Football....just the Funniest movie of the Year and Absolutely HOT guys!!!!
","Not a football fan at all, but just because I didn't have anything else to do, I watched this one....and had the time of my life doing so! Usually, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler are complete turn-offs when it comes to movies and everything else (and so is to watch former Caucasian - now almost Asian Burt Reynolds, after terrible face lifts), but since the very beginning the smart dialogs, hilarious jokes, terrificly scripted gags and incredible weird characters made me laugh one scene after another one. So think of it like this: you'll see only about 10 minutes of Chris Rock (more than enough), half an hour with Sandler's main lines (kind of dull) and the rest of the movie is all about INCREDIBLY hot Guards and Inmates (way too hunky to be in jail!) in locker rooms, half undressed and with hilarious lines......there's just no way to miss this one out!. P.S. Check out the Prison 'Cheerleaders'......and try not to pee in your pants!.",10,2,5,27 August 2005
