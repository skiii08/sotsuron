The Blair Witch Project," Masterpiece in horror with a different edge.
","After watching this for the first time I was left slightly disappointed mainly  because of the uniqueness of the movie, low budget and filming. I decided to watch it a second time uninterrupted and realized the horror that the makers tried to portray to the viewer. It really touched my senses and the movie brought to me the very elements that scare me in my own nightmares. The things that you can't see but , rather, implied have a greater effect upon your senses than those that you can! Perhaps those who had a vehement dislike to the movie should view it a second time uninterrupted just as I did. I am too scared to watch it a third time at the moment as the aura of the movie still haunt me. If watching it a second time doesn't affect you then, this is not the movie for you. Perhaps you should view movies like the Toxic Avenger etc, where blood and carnage are not left to the imagination.",10,1,2,13 December 1999
American History X," Great viewing about the skinhead movememnt
",This will have to be one of my favourite flicks for 1999! Brilliant acting by Edward Norton as he portrays an avid right winged skinhead. Later on he reforms and tries to save his younger brother from entering the movement. Great movie and shows both sides of the spectrum in terms of the Nazi movement and all types racism in general! 10/10,Null,0,0,1 August 1999
