Skyfall," Disappointing...
","...and lacklustre.If you like drab colours, muted scenes and grey British countryside, you can find Tourist Information videos on YouTube - admittedly they won't be as beautifully shot as Skyfall - but they'll have the same depth of story.This really was a sickening disappointment, where one expected fights and glamorous locations; instead we were treated to dull conversation in basements, lacking either tension or humour.And it's obvious the Global Recession has effected the budget for this latest effort, because apart from a few skyline shots in Singapore, for the most part we were ensconced in English train tunnels or grey London streets - so take a lesson from the miserly budget afforded for Bond's most recent outing, and don't waste your money.",1,32,67,28 October 2012
