The Blair Witch Project," This is the scariest film ever made; an excellent date movie!
","Three words: Scary As Hell!  This is the scariest movie I've seen in my entire life.  It's scarier than the last 3 minutes of Carrie and scarier than that dog/bum creature from the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, both which gave me nightmares when I first saw them.  This would be an excellent choice for a date movie.  I recommend that you see it and then recommend it to everyone you know, but for their sake, don't tell them the storyline.  When this arrives on home video, it will be an absolute must have addition to anyone's library.",10,1,2,27 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," This is a &*#^@!@ funny film!
","I haven't laughed this hard since my girlfriend tickled me for a few hours. Even though most parents shouldn't allow their children to see this without them, I think the issues this film deals with should be discussed among everyone.  I walked into the theatre expected to be offended in an over-the-top manner and even though such was the case at times, I never thought I'd be leaving the theatre dicussing free speach, religion, and racism with my friend.  For the shock factor alone, I would see this movie, but if you add in the social commentaries and also the genuine and outrageous humor, it's something nobody with an ounce of sanity should allow themselves to miss.  I can't wait till this comes out on DVD.  I want to learn the lyrics to 'Uncle F**ker' and 'Blame Canada.'  If we're lucky, there will be a karaoke sing-along on the disc.",10,0,0,27 July 1999
The Mummy," A fun adventure film with appropriate touches of romance and suspense.
","I enjoyed The Mummy very much.  The FX were well done and realistic.  Not that I've ever seen a 3,000 year-old mummy come to life, but I was convinced that is as it would probably look.  This is the type of movie that I'd love to see be made a franchise, ala Indiana Jones.  It packs enough adventure for 6 hours into it's approximately 2 hours running time.  The sets were very appropo and the casting was right on target.  Brendan Fraser was quite impressive as the protaganist and Rachel Weisz reminded me of Katherine Hepburn; a very strong willed woman who doesn't have a problem with being beautiful at the same time.  I reccomend this movie to anyone, including parents who want a film to babysit thier children for a few hours.",10,0,0,27 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A downward spiral towards destruction of one's morals.
","I saw this moviwe because I love Tom Cruise's work.  The fact that he'd be staring with his wife as husband and wife made this film even more attractive to me.  This being a vision of Stanley Kubrick; the visuals are at sometimes dreamlike and and at other times, utterly chilling.  Tom's performance is very convincing; adapting to his wife's actions and then later to the aftermath of his own actions.  Mrs. Tom Cruise, er, Nicole Kidman also does a fine job switching between the variences of her character (Wife-mode, Mother-mode, & Bitch-mode).  You'd swear she was playing different characters throught the film and not the same one.  In an all-too-brief, yet very revealing role, Leelee Sobieski give a dazzling performance as a obviously underage girl whom by circumstances Tom's character runs into.  Her character is one that is very sexually uninhibited and extroverted, even to the point of making a profit of her body with it, all with the gentle blessings of her father.  Yes, her father.  A final note on Leelee:  She looked damn hot bouncing around the screen in her flimsy little bra and panties.  With that said, I cannot have more respect for her performance.  She was supposed to give that effect.  The movie was, for me, disturbing at times as it dealt with the subject of infidelity and it's consequences in a couple's relationship.  I certainly would not recommend this as a date movie, unless you're in the mood for a never-ending discussion/fight afterwards.  It's good for what it is; a drama dealing with some very edgy aspects of being a couple and the extremes one may be lead to if give up caring what happens to yourself.",8,0,0,27 July 1999
