The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," No matter how lengthy the movie becomes, they should not have split it in two.
","The quality was good, the performance, the visual effects, the background music, everything. But it was just like a trailer of the whole Mockingjay movie. (No matter how good the trailer is, movie determines everything)It was actually a bad decision to split the movie in two parts and now, we have the result. I know it's all for earning more, but take examples of 'Lord of the Rings', 'Hobbit', 'GodFather', they're all lengthy movies but successful ones. Mockingjay had that potential but, the splitting not only shortened the movie length but also decreased its appreciation.However, I personally liked the movie. I didn't find any useless moments here. It always goes unsaid that book is better, but this movie does justice to the book more than the previous ones. I don't recommend this movie just now. Wait until the Part 2 gets released. Then watch both the movies together. Only then you'll truly enjoy 'The Hunger Games : Mockingjay'.",8,23,60,28 November 2014
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," It's one of my personal favorites.
","I have completed the game POP Warrior Within and POP The Two Thrones. I didn't play Sands of Time and haven't played Forgotten Sands either. But watching movie was really a fun for me. I have it on my computer and I watch it often. Normally, I like the movies relating time manipulation. The simple concept of manipulating time in POP is just to reverse it, no any traveling to past or future like in any other movies. This is the part, I like the most about it. I don't care its IMDb rating. No matter how much it gets, this movie will remain one of my favorites forever. My first impression on Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan was not good. But as the story moved on, I found the character interesting. He was almost like the prince in the game, a good swordsman and an athlete. I guess, Tamina (Gemma Arterton) from movie is actually Farah from the game. (In 'The Two Thrones', when Farah meets the Prince, she didn't recognize him.) If I'm not wrong, there are many changes in the movie and it doesn't actually follow the game plot. However, the movie is absolutely fantastic. The costumes, backgrounds and acting were almost perfect. It has a good action sequences and visual effects. I don't know whether sequel to this movie will be made or not, but I'll always be waiting for that.",7,2,2,14 November 2013
Doctor Strange," This is not just a movie. This is an experience.
","Do you remember the scene when Ariadne folds the Paris city in 2010 'Inception'? If yes, and you think that scene was breathtaking, watch 'Doctor Strange'. You'll find plenty more of such effects and these scenes are super-breathtaking. Some major parts of the movie were shot in my hometown (Kathmandu, Nepal). Except for the scenes of Swayambhunath, Pashupatinath and some places, even I could not recognize the locations. Maybe because they were recreated with special effects and the result was superb. It is a matter of pride for us, when a big budget Hollywood movie chooses Nepali Architecture for their set. I am glad, I got to see it and experience it. Thanks for the whole movie team. Story-wise, the movie seems average. The movies with the similar story are in abundance. But I know, those similar movies may never have special effects as good as this. How often do you get to see the whole street rotate? How often do you get to see the elements of the building constantly moving during the fight scene? How often do you get to see the city split, travel in fourth dimension? How often do fantasy and sci-fi blend so well that we have to find a new word for it? The effects are executed very well. One might not enjoy it in small screen but while it's still playing in the theatres, 'Doctor Strange' is a must watch. Don't miss the chance to experience it. I highly recommend it.",10,4,10,4 November 2016
Inside Out," Heart touching story of The Brain
","Nothing in the world is as powerful as emotions. Whatever we do, we do because we have emotions, either that be joy, sadness, fear, disgust or anger. These emotions are the key driving forces of our brain; our brains are controlled by them. Without one, the others can't continue on properly.This simple thing about ourselves is portrayed very well in the movie by Pete Docter; it was quite emotional. The concept behind the movie touched my heart. It brought back the memories of my childhood. It reminded me how I used to think/feel as a child. I can't get them back now, but to some extent, this movie does the job. I'm a child once again. I can feel such strong emotions that make me laugh, or cry. The last time I felt the same was while watching 'Toy Story 3'. 'Inside Out' is simply one of the brilliant animated features by Pixar.I waited a long time for this movie to be released. I expected it to be good one when I saw the trailer. However, it exceeded my expectations. It was quite heart touching that I couldn't resist myself giving this movie a 10 star. It's an excellent movie with a brilliant concept.",10,21,60,10 July 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Best version of Spiderman till date...
","The original trilogy seemed incomplete but now, that incompleteness is completed by this new one. I love the background story of Spiderman shown in this movie, at least it has got one unlike the original. The story of how Peter Parker ended up with his Uncle and Aunt, the story of why 'Peter Parker' is the only one who could be Spiderman and no-one else. It all feels complete now. A satisfactory plot for a superhero movie.Talking about the performances, I like the new Peter Parker, humorous and entertainer. I've started to feel the original 'Peter Parker' was actually boring. Really good job by the actors here. And with that SuperVillian : 'Electro', the movie becomes one of the best SuperHero movies. Visual effects are quite good and the movie is perfectly entertaining. For me, this is the best version of Spiderman movie till now. I don't care what the critics have to say, this movie is a good one.",7,34,64,3 August 2014
Ex Machina," I believe, that's what sci-fi movies are for...
","Today, we are on the verge of technological innovations. What we do, shapes the future. Our ideas, our skills, our talent, everything will take some form. It's only the matter of time. We create, we build, we explore. I believe, this is what sci-fi movies are for. 'Exploring the possibilities and going beyond the limit.' The movie does the fantastic job. It explores the possibility of Artificial Intelligence. Not only that, the sensation of 'not so distant future' brought by the indoor spaces is worth mentioning. I don't know about any other technical stuffs but the movie felt real when I was watching it. And I guess, that's a kind of great achievement for the creators of the movie.I don't recommend this movie if you are a fast-paced-action-movie lover who wants entertainment-entertainment-entertainment. But, for the true fan of the cinematic creation who want to immerse themselves in the world of cinema, this movie is a 'It's not that you must watch it, but you better don't miss it' movie. Because lots of surprises are on the way.",8,3,8,28 May 2015
Lucy," Concept is the best...
","'Human beings using 100% cerebral capacity' is a nice concept to make a movie and the movie is just satisfactory. It talks about using the intellectual capacity and shows far more than we can imagine (One thing I liked was, being able to control human and things around the person. How come we never thought about that? We can only think of having control over self). But then, I don't think 100% use of cerebral capacity will provide the access to the past unless the person studies about it or has experienced i.e. if it was already in the brain. However, if 100% capacity in the movie was used for exploring unknown rather than recollecting the known, it would have been the best Sci-fi. But here, it's a more like fantasy/superhero movie. The main concept is good. So is the performance and visual effects. But I find the story someway out of track. However, one can take it as out-of-the-box thinking. Sci-fi fans ought to watch this movie, it should be entertaining. I recommend it.",5,1,4,23 November 2014
