Iron Man 3," Whats with the Condescension? A great movie.
","I understand that the only people who would go through the process of writing a review is probably of negative opinion, but for those startled by the ranks on this page (like i was), it was a terrific addition to the series. Funny in all the right places, engaging action sequences, fast paced violence and of course Robert Downey, Jr's unmatched sarcasm and delivery. Maybe its just me, but i often get bored by action and fight scenes. This one was a pleasant delight. Very well choreographed, and perfect timing. The physics of it all was a big plus for science nerds like myself. Better than the 1st? Maybe. But all in all, a great couple of hours. Highly recommended.",6,0,3,11 May 2013
World War Z," VERY good. Extremely entertaining and better than you'd think.
","If there were a 8.5 stars option, i would choose that.It was extremely good. Constantly entertaining throughout. Brad Pitt was absolutely terrific finding the medium of action star and family man. The zombies and extras were very convincing and the plot had nearly zero loopholes. Highly recommended. The ending was a great setup for a sequel if this one fares well in ratings and sales. Again- highly recommended and beat all my expectations.The camera work was quick-cutting like seen in many action films, and i made the mistake of sitting first row in the theater. I assume it'd be much easier to follow if you were further away than first row.",8,3,11,22 June 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," An Exhausting Drama, and the Best Ending EVER.
","The #1 rating on IMDb.com's top 250 is no mistake. It was one of those movies where you feel exhausted at the end. Morgan Freeman was mind- blowingly authentic in playing Red and was made for the part. The plot was well thought out, and the escape by Andy was surprising even as a viewer. And the last 20 minutes are the best of any movie I've ever seen. It didn't leave you in tears of sadness or happiness, just a fantastic sense of closure. The acting was terrific and a spectacular way to use 2+ hours. Highly recommended and in my Top 10, easily.",9,0,0,23 June 2013
