The Blair Witch Project," I didn't like it.
","This movie was horrible.  It was more funny than scary, but it wasn't even remotely funny.  I'm sorry, but to be lost in the woods with a compass is rather inept.  I think all three of the main characters had to be seriously unintelligent to get and remain lost.  It was innovative, just not positively so.  I mean, if this is how horror movies will be in the next millenium, I'll check out the romantic comedies.  I give it very few points, mostly for the slight innovation and the concept.  Overall, it wasn't scary, nor was it an entertaining film.",1,0,1,22 August 1999
