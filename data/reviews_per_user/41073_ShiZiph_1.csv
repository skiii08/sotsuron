Lucky Number Slevin," The lucky man 'Slevin' finds himself caught between two cartel bosses and owes both of them a high amount of money.
",This movie is all about his story. The acting is good and the plot carries much potential but when you are looking for a movie which is deep and you deal with a philosophical question or theme this is not what you were searching for. You don't have to think while watching this movie and for me i felt not very much surprised by the plot twist. There are funny scenes in the movie and in the end i think that i watched an entertaining movie. And isn't that everything that are movies about? The movie is doing what its supposed to do so i was entertained by it and can recommend it. The only problem i see is the change of the personality of the protagonist which for me happened way to fast and random. Have fun watching it :),7,1,1,20 March 2016
