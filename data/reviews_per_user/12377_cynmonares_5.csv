","If you love baseball movies....If you love sports movies....If you love Rocky/Rudy underdog type of movies....If you love TRAVELING, culture, and/or experiencing India type of movies...THEN you will LOVE this movie.I happen to love all of the above, so I was extremely satisfied after watching this movie.Plus, it's a TRUE story which made it even more wonderful.I am a NY Mets fan, but now I wanna root for {{this team}} because of {{what happened}} *see movie and you'll know what I mean* :DHIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EXCELLENT MOVIE",10,2,5,4 June 2014
American Hustle," this movie is SLOW. Not as good as it looks.
","the Positives: Excellent cast, good acting. Beautiful 70s costumes. Believable. Excellent soundtrack.the Negatives: the story is SLOW. Something about the writing, it seems nothing much happens for most of the film. the movie is TOO LONG. I kept waiting for something to blow me away, but nothing. I left the movie feeling underwhelmed.If I had watched this at home, I would have fallen asleep for sure, and would have not been motivated to go back and finish the movie.Also, I do NOT think anyone on this film should win any kind of award (specifically Amy Adams or Jennifer Lawrence). Not that they weren't good, because they were great, BUT I think other actors in other movies deserve to win (ex. the lead actress in '12 Years a Slave'). The actors in this movie seemed like they were just *playing*, having fun (exception: Christian Bale, who is scary, the way he transforms).",5,2,3,24 January 2014
Rush," I LOVED THIS MOVIE, and I know NOTHING about racing & cars
","I went to see this movie because I heard it was good and I love the actors.I was pleasantly surprised to find it was SO entertaining and the story so engrossing.I was even more intrigued when I learned it was a true story! The writing and the acting were so brilliant that I fell in love with each character, and I debated throughout the entire movie, 'Which character do I like better??' (I would swing back and forth, but ultimately my heart went to Niki) The acting was spectacular. While I knew Chris Hemsworth would be outstanding, I was AMAZED by Daniel Bruhl! WOW. Both actors had fantastic chemistry and I totally believed they were lifelong racing brothers who had love/hate feelings for each other, leading towards boundless respect in the end.On some level, this felt like a Love Story, a story of redemption, and a story of brotherhood and loyalty.I walked out of the theater feeling inspired. Happy. Deep in thought. And most amazingly, CURIOUS and eager to know MORE about the world of Formula 1 Racing, cars, and the real life Niki Lauda & James Hunt!",10,3,5,24 November 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Not that great, so-so (I liked Thor 1 better)
","I had a lot of expectations, because I loved the first Thor. I was disappointed--it seemed a lot longer with too many fight scenes (found them boring). There just seemed to be more hollow action scenes and less story/depth. Too many fight scenes/political conflict scenes in ASGARD. I wanted to see more scenes where Thor interacts with earth people (Natalie Portman character).The acting was GOOD. Thor was amazing as always and LOKI was a scene stealer--such a fun & colorful character (actor Tom Hiddleston was brilliant).",6,0,3,23 November 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," EXCELLENT. Better than the book.
","I loved this movie. Initially, I was hesitant to go, but my sister & cousin wanted to see it. I was pleasantly surprised--the movie was much better than the book (in my opinion--I found the book a little too dark/depressing for my taste but the movie was exciting & entertaining throughout, while still being true to the book.)The acting was amazing. Jennifer Lawrence killed it. And the rest of the cast was spectacular.I would give it a 10 out of 10, especially because I didn't expect to like it so much. My cousin gave it an 8 out of 10; my sister loved it and gave it a 9. (Note: this is the kind of movie that will be hard to leave your chair to go to the bathroom, so it would be best to NOT drink too much soda/water.)Overall, the movie was very FUN and entertaining. If you want to go to the movies to have fun and forget about your work day, this is it!",10,2,24,23 November 2013
