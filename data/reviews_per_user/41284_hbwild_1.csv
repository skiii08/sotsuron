Requiem for a Dream," Extremely disturbing, but absolutely brilliant.
","This is not an 'anti-drug movie,' to refer to this movie as such is to miss what really makes this film great. The story, cinematography, acting, directing, camera-work... all sync together brilliantly to bring the audience on an absolutely heart-wrenching journey through the darkest corners of humanity. Requiem for a Dream is disturbing, depressing, and INTENSE, but it is also a beautiful example of how film making really is an art. There's not much more I can say about this film--it truly has to be experienced.The only other movie that I believe matches this one is Schindler's List, they are my two favorite movies of all time.",10,1,2,13 February 2008
