Howl's Moving Castle," One of my favourites
","This movie is visually stunning, the level of detail is impeccable. The character building is also very well done, watching this I felt an emotional connection with the all of main characters. The only reason I didn't rate this movie a ten is how confusing the plot is. I've watched this movie many times and I still couldn't really tell you what goes down in the last 40 minutes. Despite this I would recommend this movie to anyone :)",9,1,2,21 September 2019
28 Days Later...," Will suck you in until the very end
","Boyle masterfully creates characters that the viewers care about, only adding to the tension created by powerful acting and quick jump cuts. By deliberately avoiding cliches and cheap scares this movie stands out in the crowded
zombie apocalypse genre. This movie is not without flaws, and contains multiple continuity errors, despite this the film delivers a well rounded and most importantly, scary experience. Overall I would absolutely recommend this movie",8,1,1,10 September 2019
Midsommar," If you respect film as an art form and arent looking for easy to watch entertainment, you'll love this movie
","I love Ari Asters work, so I booked a ticket for midsommar very early. After i'd already booked my ticket I began seeing a massive amount of negative reviews for this movie. Naturally I was a bit worried, but after seeing this movie last night I couldn't disagree more.This is one of the most beautifully shot movies I've ever seen. Asters use of bright sunlight stands out from most modern horror movies which are far too often dominated by darkness. The themes of white and green in this movie juxtapose with scenes of gore and blood, creating haunting imagery that will stick with you after you leave the cinema.This movie isn't exactly thrilling but it is scary despite what many people say. I think the key to finding this movie frightening is to really try and put yourself in the mind of the characters. Something I didn't expect walking into this movie is how funny it is, throughout the first two acts the whole cinema was laughing together. The way in which Aster competently weaves together horror and gore with scenes that will make you smile is truly phenomenal.Now i'd just like to address some of the main criticisms I've seen in other user reviews:
<ul><li>many people think that this movie was predictable, although some key plot points could be described as predictable I don't think anyone could have predicted anything that happened in the third act. if you really new from the start that Christian was going to end up inside of a dead bears skin and burnt to death in a temple then kudos</li></ul><ul><li>many people think that the main character, Dani, makes unrealistic decisions, without considering the fact that shes on strong psychoactive drugs for most of the run time, her sister has just killed her mum and dad and herself and then her boyfriend of four years cheats on her during the festival. Personally i think that under these circumstances I might act a bit different too</li></ul>
( Side note: This movie is not for anyone who is easily disturbed by gore )",10,30,48,19 September 2019
