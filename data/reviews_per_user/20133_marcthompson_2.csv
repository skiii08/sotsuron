50 First Dates," A (almost) non-cliché romantic comedy...
","When you think of a comedy with Adan Sandler as main character, you think of loads of non-sense comedy, with no real story and pitiful acting. Well, in this case, you could be wrong. But, be cautious: don't expect too much! Do not watch the trailer previously! And forget the prejudice against Adan and Rob. It is a light romantic comedy with no room for common clichés, such as: a magical night of love will cure the girl from her situation; the father will only accept the boyfriend in the end; the funny friend come up with a never-thought solution. The film shows that, sometimes, is better to accept and deal with the situation, instead of struggle with it.",9,0,0,22 April 2008
The Matrix," The very best apocalyptic sci-fi ever!
","Despite been almost 10 years since its debuting, The Matrix still the top apocalyptic sci-fi movie ever made. Even better than Terminator, just because in the later, there is still hope of not allow the destruction to come. While in the former, the damage is done. Moreover, there lots of philosophy references during the movie, what make it more interesting and enjoyable. There are entire websites dedicated to explain those references. Besides that, the movie has set up new parameters for action and sci-fi movies, which has found no surpass until now. I always wander: when a movie will make me feel that way again, after seeing it? Defnetely a milestone for action and sci-fi. MUST SEE!",10,0,1,22 April 2008
