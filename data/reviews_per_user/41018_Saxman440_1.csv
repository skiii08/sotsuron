United 93," Not a fun time at the theater.
","United 93 is an excellent movie, but those of you looking for a good time might want to pick another. It is an intense drama that never leaves the reality of the true event that inspired it. It turns your stomach and breaks your heart. Each actor portrays his or her character with an honesty rarely scene in films based on true events. This is an honesty that reflects fear, doubt, hope, and confusion. For those of you who want to argue conspiracy or neglect, don't see this film. For those of you looking for an accurate assessment, this may be close. Its unbelievable how this film keeps you in reality. The utter horror of the attacks is depicted in a genuine fashion, all the while you sit among the passengers of United 93 as they remain terrified amongst the chaos that follows the hostile takeover. United 93 is a hard film to sit through. Though in it stands on its own when it comes to production, a lot of the movie's power comes from the reality of the event that inspired it, and an audience's constant reminder of this. United 93 actually went down. Those people did die. Those people did fight back. You leave feeling depressed; you are on the edge of your seat the entire time with a gut wrenching feeling. It is incredibly disturbing. This is not a movie for anyone look for an escape, however if your intentions are to see an intriguing expose about September 11, and the flight that never made its target, well Paul Greengrass has constructed a magnificent piece.",9,0,2,2 May 2006
