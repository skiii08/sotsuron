Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A letdown, even with diminished expectations.
","There's a very simple reason why the acting was 'bad' in Phantom Menace. It's not because the actors involved are poor or without talent -- just look at the people involved.  Liam Neeson.  Ewan McGregor.  Natalie Portman.All three of them are extremely talented individuals, who have a tendency to put everything they've got into a movie.  No, the true blame for how bad this movie is lies with one person:  George Lucas.You can see it in his other movies -- everything which he's directed, the acting is poor.  This is because the man has no directing talent.  His ideas are solid and imaginative, but his execution of them is lousy.I only hope that the second and third episodes return to the quality of the first two movies... and yes, I'm excluding RotJ for a reason.  It simply wasn't as good.  Maybe if we're lucky, someone else will direct.  Doubtful, with Lucas's overinflated ego, but possible.My rating: 2/10.  And that only for the impressive duels, generally impressive costuming, and raw potential (however unused) in the movie.And remember, genocide of Gungans is not a bad thing.",2,0,1,27 April 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Went downhill? No, not even that good!
","And here, after the disappointing end of Alien 3, I had thought the series couldn't possibly get worse.  Naturally, given Hollywood's ever-unsated quest for more money, I was wrong.Overall, this waste of celluloid wasn't too bad, up until the point where Michael Wincott got killed off.  (Why have such a great, charismatic actor in it if you're going to kill him before anything happens?)  After that... well, went downhill isn't the term for it.Perhaps 'jumped off a bridge with no bungee cord attached' would fit.  This was a horrible ending for a series which had promise in the first two installments.  And no, that doesn't mean I think they should make more to fix it.My rating:  1/10.",1,25,47,3 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Disappointingly mediocre.
","George Lucas, it should be noted, has gotten some things right in 'Attack of the Clones'.  He minimized the screen time of most of the more offensive and irritating characters from Episode I -- namely (Rastafarian refugee) Jar Jar Binks and the (Nipponese Empire) Trade Federation executives.  He also managed to jettison cutesy Jake Lloyd.Unfortunately, he also dumped most of the good lightsaber fights, and kept his wooden directorial style.  Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor -can- do fantastic acting work, as evidenced in movies like 'Trainspotting' and 'The Professional' and 'Beautiful Girls'.  But with a cliche-ridden, shallow script and a decrepit fool in the director's chair, even the best of actors and actresses are dragged down into the mud.Co-written by Lucas and Jonathan ('The Scorpion King') Hales, the script has all the energy of three-day-old roadkill.  It's rife with cheesy slapstick bits, recycled dialogue, and predictable plotting.  The special effects are serviceable, but fairly obvious to anyone with an experienced eye.  The lightsaber duels are pedestrian compared to the dynamic, quick-moving duels of 'The Phantom Menace' (or even of 'The Empire Strikes Back'), with the slight acrobatic exception of Yoda, master of Jedi-Fu.Lucas needs to be chained up well away from the typewriter and director's chair.  Give someone else the basics to write from, and let someone else helm the next episode.  Perhaps those others can move the series away from the less-than-impressive spectacles that Lucas's meddling has brought to pass.  After all, it worked for 'The Empire Strikes Back'.",5,0,1,16 May 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," One of the five finest films of 2001.
","Exciting, humorous, longing, tension-filled, cute... Pixar's new 'Monsters Inc.' covers an enormous range of emotions in the course of its hour-and-a-half running time.  Frankly, it feels quite a bit longer than that -- the movie absolutely draws you in.John Sullivan ('Sully' - voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Koslowski (voiced by, of all people, Billy Crystal!) are the top 'scaring' team at Monsters Inc. -- a major company in another dimension, where the society is powered by the energy contained in kids' screams.  To ensure that there is power to run Monstropolis' everyday society, the Monsters need to keep scaring kids and getting those screams -- 'We scare because we care' is the corporate slogan, showing that M.I. is the driving force behind that dimension's economy and society.Close behind Sully and Mike, though, is the treacherous Randall (voiced by Steve Buscemi), a multi-limbed chameleon-like monster with a scheme to top Sully and Mike and keep the company in the black.  Naturally, things start to go wrong when a human child from the other side manages to get into the Monster's dimensions... particularly since common knowledge holds that kids are actually toxic and poisonous to monsters!You'll gasp in awe, you'll be convulsed with laughter, and you'll smile sadly at the amazing visions, witty humor, and brilliant storyline.  I cannot recommend this film enough; I'd go see it multiple times at full price in the theaters.(This is, of course, helped by the 'introductory' animation -- a hilarious piece called 'For the Birds'.  *grin*)P.S. - my guess is that Pixar put together their standard run of 'bloopers' for the film, to be run during the credits, but are holding the new credits back a month or so to get people to come and see the film again during the Christmas season.  I'm pretty certain I will!",9,0,1,3 November 2001
Pitch Black," An impressive homage to the genre
","Truth to be told, I went into 'Pitch Black' unsure of what to expect.  I'd read a couple of reviews in the paper, largely forgotten shortly thereafter, and naturally seen the previews and ads.  Given how movies have disappointed in the past, these days I go into theatres with as few expectations as possible.I was thoroughly impressed by this movie.In the tradition of Aliens, Predator, and the like, Pitch Black makes a fine addition to the genre.  All such films share some common factors -- unknown beasties, a limited area in which to move, and people getting killed off in sundry nasty ways.  But although the basis is similar, the plot and implementation was still impressive.  The cinematography and imagery were superb, the acting excellent, and the special effects impressive.  (My primary concern with effects-generated beasties is whether or not you can tell it was effects-generated, that is, does it look like a Harryhausen stop-motion beast.  Pitch Black passed that test with flying colours.)I have to give a nod to Vin Diesel, who probably was a significant part of why this film was as good as it was.  Each of the main characters had their flaws nonetheless, Vin stands out above the rest of the pack, and not merely in physical stature (though that certainly was a part of it).  In sheer presence and in deeds his was the character that had the audience's attention.  The entire theater was clapping and cheering at one point!This movie portrays an interesting trinity of protagonists and how they react to the situation they've been placed in.  The 'taste' of the movie, if you can consider it so, was savory and thick.  It's certainly the best sci-fi movie I've seen since 'The Matrix' -- 'The Phantom Menace' was shallow and ephemeral, 'Galaxy Quest' was decent but too much of a satire to find a place in my memory, 'eXistenZ' was too bizarre, 'The Astronaut's Wife' possessed of a weak storyline, 'The 13th Floor' not bad, but too predictable- you get the picture.  And let's not even talk about 'Supernova'.The only real difficulty I had with it was the choppy editing during the first 20 minutes or so.  A few more moving shots, used to emphasise transitions, would have upped my rating that final point.Overall:  9/10.",9,0,0,24 February 2000
U-571," Solid, save for a few small nits. (spoilers)
","I find it interesting that so many people have chosen to 'torpedo' what is a solid, impressive work of historical fiction.  Yes, that's right, historical _fiction_.  Just like 'Guns of the Navaronne' is fiction, just like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is fiction, just like the vast majority of war movies.  For what it was -- a submarine movie -- 'U-571' was quite excellent.  Solid acting, casting, and sets backed up a drawing plot... would they get away? (Yes, we know that they will since it's an American movie, but ignore that for now.)  Would the capture of the submarine go through smoothly?  How close _is_ that depth charge going to come?I'd have to say the only disappointment I had with the film was the way that the German destroyer went down at the end of the film.  Regardless of how powerful a torpedo is, when it strikes the front of the ship there will not be a series of explosions going off in series throughout the length of the vessel.  The torpedo blows a hole in the hull, so that water pours in and the boat sinks... and fire is just an occasional side-effect.This isn't to say that torpedos can't be devastating -- one of the most memorable war clips I've ever seen showed a destroyer that was literally broken in half by a torpedo hit -- but simply that the overly-cinematic destroyer explosion at the end of the movie left me a bit dissatisfied.History-wise, 'U-571' seemed quite reasonable.  It was set in 1942, the year after the original Enigma machine was captured by the British... and there's no way that the crew being sent to retrieve the code machine would have previously known of Enigma.  Remember, it was a tightly guarded secret, on both sides of the war.Overall, a solid, edge-of-your-seat war thriller.  My rating: 8/10.",8,0,1,27 April 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Pretty good, but...
","... it could have been a bit more believable.  In the first film, adrenaline and action was sacrificed upon the altar of (dubious and semi-comprehensible) plot and (Brian DePalma's lackluster definition of) 'style'.  Unlike many others whose posts I've read, I didn't care for M:I-1. It was slow and unstylish, despite the director's desires... and whoever did the research for the Internet sequences fubar'd them with cheesy, low-tech AOL-looking images.M:I-2 had the style that the first film was missing.  Settings and technology in this film actually appeared to be slick-tech, and portions of THIS film where certain characters were breaking into high-security areas weren't handled in as poor a fashion as the first.  (Poisoned coffee? Sensors which don't register the sound of keyboard typing, which is certainly louder than a whisper?  And above all, being able to hack into CIA's security systems?  Has no one heard of a firewall?)  Where M:I-2 lost my suspension of disbelief was the numerous car explosions (those not caused by plastique, anyways), proof that all film terrorists must be buying their automobiles from Yugo.  =)For the most part, M:I-2 was more coherent in style and comprehensibility, even if (or perhaps because?) it was possessed of a simpler and more linear plot than the first.  The action sequences were better conceived and filmed (it amazes me that people can be impressed by the poor-effects, yawnable 'hook the helicopter to the train' schtick).  Overall, Woo is a far more capable director than DePalma seems to have become (with his last three directorial efforts, M:I-1, Snake Eyes, and Mission to Mars being particularly unentertaining).As for performances -- Tom Cruise turns in a decent performance, for an action movie.  =)  Dougray Scott is fairly solid as the villain.  Thandie Newton is, well, passable as a 'master thief', although I wish she'd had more opportunity to show off her skills instead of simply being a face on screen.  That complaint also applies to most of the remaining support cast, but then, they ARE supporting cast.  M:I-2 is definitely a star vehicle for Tom Cruise, but in my opinion it's a fairly fun one.My rating: 8/10.  But be sure to see it in a theater with good sound; it'll lose something on video or in a venue where the speakers aren't high-quality.",8,1,1,30 May 2000
The Replacements," A refreshing change from most 'comedies'...
","Judging by some of the other comments I've read, I must be one of the few who prefers actual humor and irony in my movies as opposed to the recent spate of over-raunchy jokes on bodily functions and obesity.  I actually found 'The Replacements' to be a solid, enjoyable comedy.Sure, it's a bit formulaic.  But it's less obtrusively offensive than most of the 'innovative new comedies' which have been released recently.  The sports scenes are solidly done, injecting the suspense which is often felt when watching actual games.  Of course, given the status of the movie as a Hollywood flick it was bound to come out with the underdogs on top. Watching the team get there is half the fun.Solid camraderie, fairly good characterization, actual humor (as opposed to 'Ewwwwwww! *nervous laughter*'), and an excellent soundtrack all work together to make this a great, enjoyable film.  Catch it at the theaters... at matinee, if possible, but it's still worth it for full price anywhere but California.  One word, in closing:Cheerleaders!",8,0,1,21 August 2000
The Thin Red Line," What complete drek...
","You want the truth about this film?It's a two-and-a-half-hour nature documentary, with occasional references to WWII thrown in.  Too many characters, brief plotlines that the audience is never taken back to, no real characterization (hell, we never get to meet the soldiers long enough; they all blend together), and a ton of pretentious sitting on hills pondering navels and the nature of the universe.Quite possibly one of the worst novel-to-movie adaptations I've ever read, even though the book was nothing to brag about.  Try renting 'L.A. Confidential' instead... it's far better than this ridiculous trash.I saw it at matinee and still thought I paid too much.  Don't waste your time or your money.",7,0,5,28 September 2000
