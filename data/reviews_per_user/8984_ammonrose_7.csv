First Man," Somehow triggered my Agoraphobia, but wowed me
","This movie is quite tense at some point, but it's very, very slow at other points.Ryan Gosling played a very good role for Neil Armstrong, and bring his presence to the screen in a big way. If you are looking for a movie to make your kids now want to go to space, have them watch the first half of this movie. If you want them to actually want to space, have them watch the second half. Every time he went into space, I would tense up just because of how the movie portrayed him almost dying a lot.Overall the film was visually beautiful, I would imagine seeing it in IMAX or a similar experience. The only qualms I could find with the cinematography was the shaky camera perspectives in the film. There is very few solid, fluid shots in the film and it gets a little nauseous sometimes",7,0,0,29 March 2019
Walk the Line," Really surprised with this movie.
","I came into watching this movie in a history through film class. I had no idea what this movie was but in the opening scene the directors were clever enough to slip the opening music to 'Ring of Fire' and an echoing voice saying 'Mr. Cash'. While this is a little on the nose, it certainly helped me out.
The pacing of the movie was very well done and kept my interest throughout the whole movie. This film does a great job of taking you on a emotional ride that will leave you feeling satisfied as well as having a greater respect for Johnny Cash himself. Although the movie makes you hate Cash for most of the movie, I found that by the end you could easily see how he progressed and became a better person.",8,2,2,29 January 2019
42," Wondering Why I Didn't See this Movie Sooner
","This was a fabulous movie that makes a very engaging interpretation out of a truly historic moment, both in sports and in the entirety of America. Boseman's portrayal of Robinson enables us to connect with his struggles. Laugh with him, cry with him, and cheer with him. The dynamics of the actors and the subject of the movie will keep you engaged until the end of the credits. Apart from the great movie writing, but the influence this man had on the United States is portrayed incredibly well with the contention and the development of the new ideas of equality that were in their infancy at this time and this inspires people to make changes...

Hidden Figures," A Great Depiction of Great People
",Everyone loves a movie about space. I personally really enjoy depictions of the human race figuring out hoe to get up there. The sense of realism mixed with the wonder of space is a formula for a movie that grips me every time.Another great aspect is the cultural aspect of it. Seeing people being oppressed showing others their worth and proving that they've been the same all along is just so empowering and this movie plays this very well. The only qualms I have about this movie is the fact that it seems to focus Katherine G. Johnson more than Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson. I feel that they could have been much more represented.,7,0,4,4 March 2019
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," If you have prior knowledge of this, then it's a great movie.
","This movie is rather dull for the casual viewer. Starting with the camera angles and movement; using black and white, Clooney gives it a real air of the 1950s, however the camera is very stagnant with almost no movement or dynamics at all. The movie has one of two scenes. 1. A few abstract camera angles while endless amounts of dialogue plays, and 2. a slow moving shot with people bustling around with an audio overlay of slow Jazz. While there is a few other types of shots, the movie mostly alternates between these two.
For about 30 minutes I was completely lost as to what this movie was trying to portray, so I googled all of the names and events I could hear. After hours of study time, I finally grasped what these people were even talking about. The issue is the dialogue and actual sound clips are so old or they are drown so heavily by background noise or static that you need the captions on to even understand them.
This movie was really solid once I researched it and the feelings felt very real. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my friends, but for someone who is interested in the red scare of the 50s, this is a must",6,0,0,23 January 2019
Selma," Incredible, but somewhat disturbing
","It's very hard to make a new and fresh movie based around the Civil Rights Movement because of the sheer amount of movies that have been made on it.Luckily Selma pulls this off very well Oyelowo's portrayal of King is uncanny and really shows how much of a people mover he was. This movie was going for realism, and it achieved it at the expense of a casual watch. There is a few scenes that are really hard to watch, but makes it really good as a classroom movie.Overall I'm glad to have seen this movie and I would definitely recommend this to a friend, but I wouldn't be there to watch it with them, because I was a little to shook by this movie.",7,0,2,26 February 2019
Back to the Future," Coming Back to this Time-less Classic
","Once you've seen a show since childhood almost 10 times it's easy to say that it's flawless, however as I watched this movie for a History Through Film class, I wanted to watch it as objectively as I could without my biases.
This film contains very dynamic characters (Marty and Doc) along with a few static ones (Biff). Spielberg's writing hits its mark once again by making a story with wonder but one that we can all connect with on personal levels. This movie it very fitting of being label as a classic that everyone sees.
While this movie is great, there is a few flaws. There is that classic 1980s super close up face shots that I cannot stand. Another problem with the movie is again an issue I have with a lot of 80s era movies, which is bad sound design. The super loud sound effects with a lot of the movie consisting of yelling.",8,0,0,4 February 2019
