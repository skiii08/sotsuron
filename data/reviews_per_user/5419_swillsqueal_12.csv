Come and See," What happened in the Soviet Union during WWII...
","This is the greatest war movie ever. The best way to describe it, I reckon, is to pass on a newspaper article written by Ilya Ehrenburg during World War II when all the things which happen in 'Come and See' were happening:NIKOLAI VLADIMIROVICH -- ONE YEAR OLD Red Star, November 30 1943How much the Germans have taken from us! They have taken from us not only loved ones, homes, and possessions. Life was complicated. There were dreams, joys, people, many books, many countries. But now everything in me is unchangeably focused on one thing: on the German. I see him -- blue-eyed and inhuman. He walks and kills, he sings and kills, he laughs and kills.Among the papers of the town head of the village of Vyazovaya, recently liberated from the Germans, was found the following document:'List of executed residents of the village of Vyazovaya, Uzninskaya region:1) Muzalevskaya Natalia Ivanovna. 43 years old. 2) Muzalevskaya Natalia Nikolaevna. 18 years old. 3) Muzalevskaya Diana Nikolaevna. 16 years old. 4) Muzalevsky Lev Nikolaevich. 13 years old. 5) Muzalevskaya Valentina Nikolaevna. 9 years old. 6) Muzalevskaya Tamara Nikolaevna. 5 years old. 7) Muzalevskaya Rima Nikolaevna. 3 years old. 8) Davydov Vladimir Ilych. 35 years old. 9) Davydov Anatoli Vladimirovich. 8 years old. 10) Davydov Victor Vladimirovich. 5 years old. 11) Davydov Nikolai Vladimirovich. 1 year old. 12) Pryadochkina Maria Petrovna. 60 years old.19 September 1942. Town head Muzalev.'Can this be forgotten? Is it possible to live knowing that people are walking the earth who shot Davydov Nikolai Vladimirovich to death, one year old, an infant, the baby Kolya, shot him and ordered his name entered into a list? It is hard to talk about it, but impossible to forget. We still have a long way to go. But we will get there. We will find them. We will find them under their beds, in their vegetarian cafeterias, at the ends of the Earth. We will remember the one-year-old Kolya Davydov. We will remember much. **********The director, Klimov, concentrates on faces. From the faces you can see what they saw. Come. Come and see what this war was about in the Soviet Union. This was a war to the death; the Soviets knew and the Germans knew it. The Germans knew it because their leaders declared it so and 23 million Soviets paid with their lives. Ten million Germans also paid the price of that sale. The seller pays the price of the sale.",Null,33,43,1 December 2008
The Ring," Sleepless in and around Seattle
","Don't see this movie! I'm telling you, don't see this movie, especially at night when it's raining and you've got the lights out. Although 'The Ring' has one of my favourite actresses in it, don't see it. Naomi Watts is terrific in so many ways and very convincing as Rachel. Still, the movie should not be seen. It's terrible! I do think that either the director or the writers knew about Luis Bun~uel and Salvador Dali's 'Andalusian Dog' because the video tape that Rachel is told not to see, but sees anyway, seems very much modeled on that early surrealist film. 'Andalusian Dog' (1929) has its ants, while the video within 'The Ring' has its fly.'The Ring' is the scariest ghost movie you'll ever see, which is why you shouldn't see it. It ranks up there with my favourite FRANKENSTEIN-themed film, 'The Fly'. In terms of 'The Ring''s fright potential, it is unequaled. It's well acted, well scripted and the music assists foreboding mood, rather than getting in the way.'The Ring' could have been titled: 'Sleepless Around Seattle'. Calling it, 'The Ring' gives it a Wagnerian tone. But no, this ring heralds a phone call. You pick up the receiver and some insomniac child from a 'village of the damned' will tell you that you only have seven days to live because you watched her personal 'Un chien andalou'. Samara will come, 'uninvited' to visit you in seven days. Don't risk this. Don't see 'The Ring'.",8,0,1,21 March 2007
The Hustler," Can't buy me love....
","What's an artist to do in a society where value is equated with money? As the film opens, Fast Eddie Felson and his sidekick Charlie are on the road, hustling small town, poolroom suckers all the way from Oakland to somewhere near Pittsburgh on their way to New York City. Eddie's goal is to play and beat the great Minnesota Fats at straight pool--call the ball number and call the pocket, first to 125 wins. Eddie carries his leather cased cue like a gunfighter and this showdown is to take place at the Ames Pool Hall. Paul Newman said once, 'Ames in New York was on 47th Street on the second floor, just off Broadway.' It's a dark place, an arena, a semi-lit coliseum where men play games for money. But, for Eddie, this game is more than just another hustle for money. He's come to claim the title of the best, number one, the champion and the only person standing in his way is Minnesota Fats.Bert Gordon is the local money betting boss. Bert's a gambler. He's also a power broker for those who want to play games for high stakes. Gordon is a businessman, part finance capitalist, part lord. He's a cunning dude, made powerful by the usual exploitation of finance capital and usurers in general, percentage loans. He's also keenly aware of the character weaknesses of his bondsmen.When Eddie plays Fats that first time, we see that he is a better pool player. Neither Eddie nor Minnesota are mere cheap hustlers taking the money of fools who bet their money on their skills versus theirs, but that is the way they make their livings. No, Fast Eddie and Minnesota Fats are artists. They love the game they play and they play the game they love and they're the best at what they do.Bert uses people to make money and to make himself feel powerful. The lower you are, the higher Gordon is. Ever conscious of his place at the top of the heap, Bert is there to see Minnesota eventually turn the tide on Eddie. Fats maintains his cool. Hubris comes before Eddie's long fall from a winning peak of $18,000 back to his $200 stake. Gordon sees this weakness in Eddie and declares Felson a loser, even as Eddie has reached his peak in winnings. Bert's money backs Fats and the game goes on way longer than its initial 26 hours.'What beat me?' Eddie asks Gordon. 'Character,' Bert replies.Eddie is spooked by Gordon's 'loser' tag. He abandons Charlie, his long time partner and goes off to lick his psychological wounds. Charlie has disappointed Eddie with his all too human focus on saving enough money for his old age. Charlie doesn't doesn't understand Eddie's need to practice his art as his motivating factor in life--that motive stands above the security of money.That's when Eddie meets Sarah. Sarah has been into a heavy bout of self-destruction. She doesn't want to live in a world where her humanity is treated as an object for sale. In her own way, Sarah has become a loser, hiding her failure to find a loving relationship in endless bottles of scotch. After the two meet, they retreat to Sarah's apartment for what appears to become a last tango in New York. At first though, Sarah rejects Eddie. 'You're too hungry,' she says to him after their first lustful kiss. But she realizes as Eddie does later, '25% of something big is better than a 100% of nothing.' She takes a chance that Eddie and she might find love.Sarah turns out to be right with her gamble. She falls for Eddie because she sees that Eddie is a lover, a man who is passionate about his art and about life. She sees what Bert's inherent sadism is as well. It's Gordon who feels weak and characterless in the face of passion filled men like Eddie and to women in love, like herself. She sees that behind Bert's mask, he sees people as mere things to be manipulated for his own accumulation of power. At a crucial point in the lovers' dialogues, which take place between Eddie and herself, she asks Eddie why he thinks Bert is right about him being a loser. The implied question is what makes Gordon a winner. 'He owns things,' Eddie says about Bert, explaining why Felson and others think Gordon is a winner. Sarah replies, 'Is that what makes him a winner?' What is a winner? Someone who possesses the colour of money? Where does Bert's power come from? 'He owns things.' That's Eddie's answer. But after Sarah hears Eddie's rapturous description of pool as art, she says, 'You're not a loser Eddie. You're a winner. I love you Eddie.' At that moment, Eddie begins to understand what it's all about--his character is enriched by love freely given. He only begins at that point though. He only begins.....the play's the thing and at the end of his game with Minnesota Fats there is a felt mutual recognition and respect in the air. At the same time, the relation of lordship and bondage is broken on Eddie's newly found character, integrity, courage and solidarity. All this personal strength and solidarity has been brought to the fore by love.Willie Mosconi, the best pool player ever, advised Gleason (Fats) and Felson (Newman) on pool playing and he plays a bit part in 'The Hustler', as does one former Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta.See this movie.",10,1,2,14 March 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," Global warming is serious. 'The Day After Tomorrow' is not.
","Oh well, it's the MARKET stupid and the market IS stupid and films like ideas are commodities and HAVE to be sold and have nice endings where the girl gets the boy and a few superfluous side-kicks get 'kilt'. Meanwhile...reality continues apace...the permafrost is melting and carbon based fuels are being burnt like there's no tomorrow while tough grass is starting to sprout in Antarctica.This films stars your old Cecil B. DeMille favourites 'special' 'effects' and a few humans, a Border Collie and some fake wolves who, at best, are affecting a 'made for TV' drama. The premise is true enough. If global warming gets to the tipping point vis a vis ocean currents, we're in for it AND, it looks like matters are going that way, courtesy of a system consigned to 'invisible hands'. But the nonchalance of most, including most of our fearless leaders, is matched by the 'Hollywoodized' treatment of this very serious subject in 'The Day After Tomorrow'.Don't worry babies. Lots of the human race will survive to continue to drive their Humvees. You've seen the worst. Ah, the vicarious, the virtual life. Now to cuddle up next to the fireplace, in pajamas even and dream about burning a few books.",2,1,4,27 December 2005
The Aviator," The Force of Imagination
","'The Aviator' is a work of art, not a vain attempt to create a realistic biography on film. Scorsese paints his scenes with oblique brush strokes and his icons take their forms.As the film opens, the audience is shown the young Howard Hughes being washed, tested and warned by his mother. They are sequestered in a large, quiet, clean parlour room. A fear of outside contamination is being inculcated into his psyche. John Logan, the film's scriptwriter, seems to be saying that Howard's formative years were spent in very protective custody. The safety of home, of being inside with one's parents, especially with one's mother. The oblique reference here is to 'Citizen Kane' and his sheltered childhood. 'Rosebud' becomes 'Quarantine. Q-u-a-r-a-n-t-i-n-e. Quarantine', a semi-mystic recurrence.You are conscious that you are watching film from the beginning to end of 'The Aviator'. Cinema itself becomes a kind of religious artifact for Scorsese as his choice, to use the more primitive colour technology of the 30s (film stock registering reds and blues, but not greens) to shoot the first half of the movie, demonstrates. His selection of quality period music is impeccable and exciting in itself. Hence, authenticity in 'The Aviator' is reserved for art. Approximation will do for life. The realities of Hughes', Hepburn's, Domergue's and Gardener's lives, amongst others portrayed in the film, take a back seat to Scorsese's artistic license. And this is not really such a bad thing, although that observation occasionally goes unappreciated because of the proclivity of certain people go to the movies to vicariously experience the lives of real people. They feel cheated when that experience is denied, even when it is artistically, that is, consciously short circuited.Thus, it is difficult for many audience members to get their heads around the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio is Howard Hughes. He's not supposed to be the real Hughes. He is an icon representing Hughes. Sure, that happens in other movies too. But, in this one, it is different. You can never suspend your disbelief as in the way you would in say, Scorsese's 'Raging Bull'. Neither can you suspend your disbelief that Cate Blanchett IS Katherine Hepburn. Even Cate's mastering of the Hepburn's signature accent is not on, in terms of getting you to believe that she is anybody but Cate Blanchett. Still, one does very much appreciate the acting abilities of everyone in this film, including Kate Beckinsale, but nobody who has actually seen Ava Gardener in movies like 'Night of the Iguana' can find Beckinsale other than a finely sculpted representation of the voluptuous Ms. Gardener. And as for Alan 'the MASH' Alda, playing the corrupt, McCarthy era Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, please, it's just not possible. Still, they're all excellent when taken in the context of the totality which is 'The Aviator'. The actors remain engaging, even as the film itself moves with its own kind of surrealist animus.As George Orwell accurately observed, 'All art is propaganda, but not all propaganda is art.' Fortunately, 'The Aviator' is both. Its art can be found in its cinematographic beauty, the quality of the performances and direction and in its meaning. Hughes was an archetype of the entrepreneurial spirit of Christmases past; a time when one man could use his accumulated wealth to achieve the goals his imagination generated. In his own filmic way, Scorsese has replayed the American dream which swirls in so many minds today; the dream of capitalism and freedom; the dream of near, absolute power to change the world. Hughes had all of this, of course. At one paranoid point in the film, Hughes asks one of his confidants, 'Who is that man? Does he work for me?' To which, one of his executive hirelings replies, 'Why Mr. Hughes, everyone works for you.'The Hughes and Hepburn of 'The Aviator' represent those dreamy icons. They are at their peak in the depths of the Great Depression. At a time when Woody Guthrie would be walking out on a well paid gig at the Coconut Grove to hop a freight and preserve his sense of integrity, Hughes would be thinking of buying the Grove as he obsessively planned his next Hollywood blockbuster. Meanwhile, the glam-dame Hepburn would be seeking solace in Howard's courage to challenge the petty-minded money changers of the sexist Hollywood Establishment. To be sure, Hughes backed up his daring with financial power and a proved ability to beat the odds while making money at creatively inspired projects. Hughes' qualities were not lost on the astute Hepburn. In 'The Aviator', they enjoy a mutual affection which was driven by more than money. In 'The Aviator', it's pure audacity which makes them 'cling' together like two glasses of Veuve Clicquot while flying Howard's plane around the skies of Los Angeles.This is a great artistic opus, from the consciously chosen uses of form: the primitive two-colour process during the first half of 'The Aviator', to the content embedded in philosophical-political-psychological messages running through the whole of its 170 minute run-time. Martin Scorsese is the Orson Wells of our time.'Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature. They are organs of the human brain, created by the human hand; the power of knowledge, objectified. The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it. To what degree the powers of social production have been produced, not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social practice, of the real life process.' Karl Marx (1857) The GRUNDRISSE, chapter 14",8,0,2,11 May 2006
Revolutionary Road," The Big Bourgeois Trap
","Wage-slaves tend to reproduce the lives which their parents lived, with minor changes of location and personages. It's also true that some young adults swear that they'll live life differently. There's an urge to avoid a meaningless existence. There is that youthful Kerouac-like urge to escape the Big Bourgeois Trap and instead, to jump in the car, put the peddle to the metal and be free.Willy Loman was trapped. Arthur Miller wrote his play 'Death of a Salesman', revealing the life of a tired, forgotten wage-slave near the end of life's road; loyal to his bosses, disloyal to his wife, while lying to his kids and at the same time supporting them financially through his tireless journeys for love and money. It's more than ironic that Elia Kazan directed 742 performances of 'Death of a Salesman' in which Lee J. Cobb played the empty, hopelessness characterized in Willy. Ironic why? Because, among other things, Kazan's granddaughter has a significant role, playing Milly in 'Revolutionary Road'. Ah, but that's another story. See the film.Willy Loman's world is just one aspect of this 1955-centered movie which can be mined by the mindful. There are so many others, including references to the movie version of Edward Albee's George and Martha in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'. Ah yes, the 'bickerings' you say. Ah yes, the secrets, lies and use of sex as a weapon in the struggle between males and females in marriage. Ah, but there's even more to 'Revolutionary Road' than this.'Revolutionary Road' is about the desire for freedom, nay, the instinct for freedom which is constantly being stomped down within the Big Bourgeois Trap from the time you are a terrible two until you've finally grown up and realized that you must be an adult and conform. Either that or die or become a hobo or be thrown in an insane asylum as the mathematics Ph.d. John Givings has been in 'Revolutinary Road'. John (played excellently by Michael Shannon) is that kind of Francis Farmer non-conformist who has not grown out of his child-like bluntness, ergo, he must be shocked to keep from shocking others. (Was he thrown in the asylum by his ever loving mother, played by Kathy Bates?) He blurts out truths, even within proper, safe social settings. He blurts them out like the machine gun fire one might face as a soldier during WWII. Frank Wheeler (Di Caprio) has seen this kind of truth before. At first, he and April recognize it and embrace it. Frank was a soldier, facing death in the WWII, which in 1955 had only ended ten years before. It was at that moment of life or death truth, he confesses to his wife April (Kate Winslet), that he felt the most alive, even though he was frightened. And April, whose love for her husband has been challenged by the hum-drum life of housewifery in the safe, leafy suburbs of NYC, confesses that she felt the same, existential awakening when she first experienced love making with Frank, back when they were young and on their own revolutionary road away from the ordinary lives which their parents had lived. The moment of this mutual recognition leads to a very steamy sex scene in the kitchen. Surely, you are interested now, dear readers.The thing is that Frank is now a salesman for the same company which employed his father and he sees the death trap of a Willy Loman lifestyle descending over him, much as Willy's children saw it destroy their father. April sees it too. But hell, they've now decided to chuck it all, the relative security of life in the burbs of the 50s to take a chance on April in Paris. Yes, to move the two kids and their married lives ('the whole catastrophe', to quote Zorba) to Europe where existentialist juices are imagined to be flowing as freely as the espresso at the Cafe des Deux Maggots. The prospect of finally 'finding themselves' blooms somewhere, just over the rainbow shrouded Atlantic Ocean. Yes, the chimes of freedom are flashing again after some years of marriage with its triumphs and disappointments. Their instincts have been re-awakened from the doldrums of everyday life in the 50s with the father kissing the wife a la Dagwood and taking off to bring home the bacon from the office which Mr. Dithers runs and the kids, of course, running around in the yard shouting, 'Mommy' and 'Daddy'.In the beginning of their relationship, both April and Frank really want this freedom from the Big Bourgeois Trap and they believe that this urge places them in another league from their peers. This urge sets them on fire with love for each other. Others see the spirit in them too, the ones who have already grown-up, conforming to the lies required of fear-filled wage-slaves in everyday life. They want to touch it; but are ultimately cowed by their social conditioning, rationalized as,'familial responsibilities'. When Frank is offered a big promotion in sales (he will be an ad-man for the then, cutting edge exotic machines called computers), he is tempted to accept and give up on pulling up stakes in burbs and moving to Paris with April.April is not of the same mind. She is still star struck with the idea of getting out, perhaps escaping to the sheltering skies of Tangiers with Paul Bowles, instead of ending up as yet another archetypal Lucy Jordan, wife to that ultimate tragic archetype of capitalism, Willy Loman. Thus, lovers become haters and the road to revolution in their lives turns into its opposite: death on the installment plan in middlebrow suburbia, complete with those occasional visits to a reputable psychiatrist, just so one can remain safely shrink-wrapped in the Big Bourgeois Trap.",9,0,1,31 January 2009
Into the Wild," 'He's leaving home, bye, bye'.....the quest for IT....
","ON THE ROAD by Jack Kerouac was published 50 years before this film came out. And then there was Voltaire's CANDIDE. Can the Enlightenment be so very far away? A lot of people get irritated with Holden Caufield when they read CATCHER IN THE RYE. A lot of people react the same way when they encounter Christopher McCandless and they WILL encounter his persona on screen for years to come, thanks to Sean Penn. Why this irritation? It's like asking why the squares got irritated with the gatherings of gentle people at Monterey Pop during that 'Summer of Love' in 1967 Frisco : in essence, people like Christopher McCandless remind them of their own 'lives of quiet desperation' of what 60s freaks called, 'the death culture'.Christopher McCandless is a well read guy. He pulls out his Jack London and Leo Tolstoy in order to be closer, to relax with his friends. He's had it with what Holden Caufield called,'phonies' and these include his lying parents. Generation gap redux, mai oui. Christopher McCandless wants to discover Truth. And to do this, he ventures out 'on the road' as Dean Moriarity and Sal Paradise did in 1947, hitching and driving and being driven all over America and even down to Mexico, just as Sal and Dean did. And just as Dean and Sal were, Christopher McCandless is searching for IT. But what is IT? Christopher McCandless only knows that IT isn't the narrow materialistic individualism of his parents or of people like them. He fervently believes in a 'spiritual' path which might lead one to IT, but first he must divest himself of crass materialism-- most worldly goods . For, unlike the rich man/camel who cannot pass through the eye of a needle, Christopher McCandless will make it into his heaven because he refuses excess material. He believes in his vow of poverty. So did the Buddah and a thousand Beats and Hippies. He believes that he must make contact with the 'spiritual' truth by living simply, living like a character out of one of Jack London's adventurous Alaskan adventures. It is a call of the wild which draws him, north, ever north to the Alaska outback. There, he reads Tolstoy's words on how to achieve happiness through simple living and he takes that advice on, living in his own 'Magic Bus'...oh shades of Kesey may your spirit live on.Is it true? Can one find 'spiritual' fulfillment this way? Perhaps. Especially, if one is inclined to try to find it standing on its head, as the priest in 'The Black Robe' did in his 17th Century Canadian wilderness trek amongst the native heathen. Religious quests are almost always filled with suffering. Is this not why we were placed on this Earth, like so many chess pieces for the amusement of our Lard.But, in material reality what hath Penn wrought? This is a lad with all the right instincts for freedom, still tied in knots with philosophical Idealism. He's trying to kick out the jams; but he doesn't realize that heading down the path of material deprivation will not get him home--free. As a result of his 'true believer' mentality, poor Christopher McCandless doesn't recognize his real happiness when it stares him, lovingly in his face. Ah sweet Tracy... He sees the poverty of a future of dead time in the suburbs and he rejects it. Good move, Chris. This rejection makes a lot of the one-dimensional individuals hate him, especially when his disdain is magnified on the silver screen. He sees the wisdom of NOT 'taking more than you can use' from the Earth, a fact that is brought home hard for him when he shoots a moose, he cannot possibly consume. Hooray for Christopher McCandless there! Christopher McCandless made some discoveries. Like Candide, Sal Paradise, Holden Caufield and the people of his own parents' generation, especially ones who can be seen on in docos like 'Monterey Pop', he did glimpse IT here and there, only to lose it in the end. For it is in the social relations of friendship and love, all of which he leaves behind in order to live on his own, in a vain attempt to depend only his own, narrow individualism to find 'the truth'. The ghost of Dean Moriarity, walking down those railroad tracks in Mexico...yes, Dean More-E-air-IT-tee.",7,0,1,8 January 2008
The Departed," The ugly side of competition: one stab in the back produces another
","Some people just want to relate to others as human beings. Others want their place in the hierarchy of power. DiCaprio plays the former, while Nicholson plays the latter. There are no winners in these bleak lives, but there are plenty of rats in the race.With his fine sense of music, Scorsese continues to place the right songs in the most appropriate places in 'The Departed'. With the Stones' 'Gimme Shelter' in the background, he introduces his king rat, Costello, and as Jack gives his audience his best seductive smile, the lyrical aftermath of 'Sympathy for the Devil' can almost be heard to begin its refrain in your brain. It's those kinds of touches which make 'The Departed' an excellent film, a film where, 'every cop's a criminal and all the sinners, saints.' As heads is tails, just call Jack, Lucifer, as I believe this film explains.But what would Lucifer be without his collaborators. Nothing. He needs them for his power and they need him in order to taste and smell same. They kneel and he arbitrarily and capriciously dispenses death.This is not a nice movie about nice people. It is a kind of 'immoralty play', where love is always taking a back seat to death. In this sense, 'The Departed' continues Scorsese's fine tradition of exposing the criminal mind and milieu which began with 'Mean Streets'.",8,1,2,10 July 2007
The Reader," Why didn't you speak up?
","'Every single day -- 365 days a year -- an attack against children occurs that is 10 times greater than the death toll from the World Trade Center...We know how to prevent these deaths -- we have the biological knowledge and tools to stop this public health travesty, but we're not yet doing it.' Jean-Pierre Habicht, professor of epidemiology and nutritional sciences at Cornell.Eight million of the eleven million childhood deaths a year could easily be prevented. That's because almost 60 percent of deaths of children under 5 in the developing world are due to malnutrition and its interactive effects on preventable diseases. Is this not a holocaust? An old Soviet piece of gossip had it that Comrade Khruschev was interrupted during his famous 'secret' speech before the Communist Party elite when he denounced Stalin's crimes in 1956, three years after Stalin's death. A voice from the audience shouted, 'Why didn't you speak out against these crimes when Comrade Stalin was committing them?' Khruschev looked up from his speech and asked loudly, 'Who said that?' A long silence ensued after which Khruschev observed, 'That is why.' When you see 'The Reader', ask yourself why you are doing nothing about the holocaust which is happening every year to the poorest children of the world. Is it because you are afraid to be seen as being 'silly' or too 'socialist' or 'soft hearted' or because the system demands that you pay attention to the important things of life like obeying your bosses and keeping order and besides, 'What can a lowly person like myself do about the situation' and you're too busy speculating on what the real estate market will be doing in the coming months and finding a pair of jeans at Jeans West which will fit.....Michael meets Hanna when he is fifteen. Unbeknownst to Michael, he is coming down with scarlet fever. He is throwing up in an alley on a very rainy day when Hanna, the tram conductor, stops to offer him a warm place to rest until he feels better. Hanna also cleans up his vomit from the pavement. Hanna believes in orderliness and cleanliness. This penchant for order is apparent from the beginning of their relationship and these traits lead her to offer Michael baths and to bathe herself as well and as the movie progresses the motherly Hanna and her son-like friend begin to explore the attractions which flow from such erotic circumstances.Both Hanna and Michael are full of hidden passions. Michael could have been a Heydrich in Prague, had he been born 15 years earlier. He is clearly 'officer material'. Hanna, on the other hand, is a working class woman born 30 years earlier into a society which would tell women that their highest aspirations could be fulfilled by staying in the kitchen with the children when they weren't engaged in taking in a church service. with the family. Education was unnecessary. Both Hanna and Michael are intelligent and attractive. Both are turned on by the doors which are opened to them by great literature. Both are also social products of their own German culture, with its various and sundry facets of puritanical, psychological repression, including a kind of reserve which leads to the peculiarly German goodness of keeping one's mouth shut in public about things political, things which the authorities have well in hand. Hanna's fear of exposing her own illiteracy and Michael's fear of public condemnation as a young law student at speaking up for Hanna in a court of law are the stuff of tragedy. Sound familiar? Even after many steamy sexual encounters, Hanna is shocked by passages in D.H. Lawrence's LADY CHATTERLY'S LOVER, telling Michael that it is the equivalent of smut and that he should stop reading from it, almost as his mother would have. But clearly, Michael is not attracted to Hanna because she is a mother replica--Oedipus, no. One has only to compare and contrast Michael's screen mother with Kate Winslett's Hanna to know that.However, it is 'klip und klar' that Hanna loves Michael and he loves her but, unbeknownst to them both when they are together, their love runs very, very deeply. They might believe that they will get over their summertime romance as time goes by, but the reality is that such love does not die, no matter what happens: there are no conditions for it.There are elements of Fassbinder's 'Ali, Fear Eats the Heart' and 'Berlin Alexanderplatz' in 'The Reader'. 'Sophie's Choice' also comes to mind. See this movie and be prepared to cry for humanity because as Thoreau observed, ''Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.' Methnks this is especially so in cultures as deeply built on the authoritarian personality character structure as the German one is.",8,18,24,20 June 2009
Beowulf," 'What's new Beowulf'....or LORD OF THE GEATS
","It was the early 8th Century A.D. when BEOWULF was penned. It was a time of massive change for the Anglo-Saxons, Danes and Anglo-Celts of Britain and the various Viking tribal kingdoms, East and West in the surrounding sea swept Danish kingdoms. The times of pagan ritual and heroes were morphing into the Medieval Christian era. It was also a time of upheaval, with the old ideological authoritarian structures crumbling, leaving room for literary creativity. Compared with what was to follow, it was a mini-renaissance. Then, dead time ruled up until at least the 14th Century when Chaucer came on the scene, along with the new times which were brewing underneath the slow but sure decay of the Christian Dark Ages.So, BEOWULF the literary work, reflects a newly forming 8th Century A.D. Christian message which is also wrapped up with a lot of Viking era, pagan lore, including the existence of monsters like Grendel, who according the the epic poem, was a descendant of Cain, the brother of Abel, sons of Adam and Eve. In 'Beowulf' the movie, matters are different; but still very exciting, pregnant with change. These are our times, on the edge of climatic upheaval and political turmoil which certainly rivals and probably surpasses that of the 8th Century era. But now, epic must change in both form and its content. No longer an epic poem, 'Beowulf' has become the 3D movie. Grendel is still a monster; but not descended from Cain. No, unbeknownst to all, Grendel, the monster is descended from Hrothgar, King of the Danish tribe known as the Scyldings.This twist in the tale gives rise to a variety of opportunities to turn the original ideological intent of BEOWULF's author on its head, for Grendel's mother is none other than the ever enticing Angelina Jolie...I mean, when she wants to be, she's an irresistible Circe.In the original BEOWULF, our hero of the Geats (a West Danish tribe), does race Breca through the ocean for five days straight and he does encounter difficulties with sea monsters; but in the movie, Beowulf is also seduced by a monster turned a kind of beauteous mermaid.Such is life in a sea of change and when our filmic Beowulf lays eyes on ultra-attractive women, he is slain and eventually lain. And from his loins spring.....well, in the original epic poem, Grendel is outfoxed and beaten by Beowulf who confronts Angelina Jolie's child, naked, without armour in that great mead hall, Heorot! True to the spirit of the Viking Danes (both East and West--Geats were West Danes) and of BEOWULF the original, Herot is the place where lustful heroes and wenches frolic and feast and drink, not only the honey-based mead, but also those tankards and tankards of ale. Grendel is spoiling the fun by coming to Herot to slaughter and feed--on warriors and maidens. Shame. So, it's Beowulf to the rescue, all naked and shiny and strong like a bull. When Grendel feels the power of Beowulf's grip, he knows that he's met his match.In the poem, Beowulf slays both Grendel and his mother, an appropriate entry into the staid, stagnant world Medieval monkery. In the film however, the slaying of one becomes the laying of the other and very importantly: lies, betrayals and in their wake, the slow death for ancient heroism a la Odysseus prevail, as Christianity rises and the once meek, weak, double-dealing, fratricidal Unferth becomes the personification of a sadistic Christianity in the power saddle, slouching towards the Dark Ages.But wait...lustful loins, heroism and dragons will have their day! And the father will eventually be re-united with his son and the spirit of Grendel's mother will live on as she faces noble Wiglaf, Beowulf's comrade in arms, breast deep from the waves at the end of the flick.See this movie in the 3D version. And don't quibble too much about the cgi effects. Just enjoy your time in the ale hall. Long may Heorot stand!",7,1,3,24 December 2007
V for Vendetta," I am V
","As Julie London sings 'Cry Me a River', we enter the abode of another lonely phantom of the opera. Is it the weatherless underground made real or is it a lie used to tell the truth...as art does? Is that Robert Donat's voice under that mask or is it the soundtrack from the movie version of 'The Count of Monte Cristo'? Is that Winston Smith on the telly? Has Mr. Smith gone to Washington and become BIG BROTHER?Ah no...this is London calling. **************************************Quoting from the movie: Dominic: What do you think will happen? Finch: What usually happens when people without guns stand up to people *with* guns. *********************************************'Depends on how many unarmed people are standing up', says I. Then, there's the issue of authority, especially within an authoritarian State. What if the bosses have been *silenced* and the orders to fire fail to arrive?The sax of Stan Getz whisps blue bosa nova notes from V's juke box. Evey is V's 'Girl from ipanema'. ****************V: Violence can be used for good. Evey Hammond: What are you talking about? V: Justice.***************************************Plato wrote a lot of dialogues about justice--starring Socrates, of course. Justice is an ideal. V stands for vengeance. He's is one of the few survivors of a future day's Mengelesque research miracle. The monster wants to kill his Doctor, not to mention Frankenstein's Fuehrers.But of course, this phantom needs a bride. As Evey transforms from the fashionably coiffed movie starlet look to that of a shaven Elsa Lanchester, she sheds more than her hair. She leaves her fear behind and with it her mental shackles.************************************Interrogator: I am instructed to inform you that you have been convicted by special tribunal and that unless you are ready to offer your cooperation you are to be executed. Do you understand what I'm telling you? Evey Hammond: Yes. Interrogator: Are you ready to cooperate? Evey Hammond: No. Interrogator: Very well. Escort Ms. Hammond back to her cell. Arrange a detail of six men and take her out behind the chemical shed and shoot her. Guard: It's time. Evey Hammond: I'm ready. Guard: Look all they want is one little piece of information, just give them something, anything. Evey Hammond: Thank you, but I'd rather die behind the chemical sheds. Guard: Then you have no fear any more. You're completely free.**********************************In FDR's First Inaugural he proclaimed, 'Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself.' Hegel hinted at this in his famous passage on 'Lordship and Bondage'. The Lord has the power we give to Her/Him. We give it because we fear the power of the Lord, but it is our power which we give away; our power to be free is fettered by fear. I am Spartacus. I am V.Now, you're ready to see 'V for Vendetta'. It is anti-fascist cinematic art at its best.",8,0,2,21 December 2006
The Godfather," All in the family....
","All praise the godfather, patriarchal symbol of our time. For he is disappearing, yet fighting to reappear, fighting to be relevant. He has the audacity to proclaim honor among thieves, bullies and murderers. And for this, we are grateful. Opportunists may triumph, but we will preserve HIS spirit in our minds, amen.If you go through the list of reviewers who love this movie and, if you listen to your friends who rave about its greatness, you'll find a not so astonishing leitmotif. They are almost all men. These men see 'The Godfather' as symbolic of something. It's something sort of mystical, just like the rituals of the Catholic Churchgun smoke and incense. It has to do with the right of fatherly place, something which is being lost as time has marched on, ever onwards towards an oblivion of irrelevance for patriarchy, the family, private property and the State itself! We mourn the loss. We are nostalgic for these good old days. This is a tragedy. But, buck up, me buckos. It's also reality. You know that. That's what's so good about 'The Godfather'. It's REAL, baby! Don Vito Corleone is right to recognize that the potential violence embodied in HIM, the patriarch of the ruling family and his/its gang of servant/employees gives him the power to dispense justice. Kiss his hand. Lick it. He is Papa, you guinea. Justicewhat an abstraction, all filled with nicety-nice images of doing good unto others as you would have them do unto you. Pure crapola! You beat the crap out of your enemies and underlings and show them who's boss! That's the reality of everyday life within the political-economy of capitalism : political power comes out of the barrel of a gun baby and it hurts! Michael: So the next day, my father went to see him; only this time with Luca Brasi. And within an hour, he signed a release, for a certified check for $1000. Kay: How'd he do that? Michael: My father made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Kay: What was that? Luca Brasi held a gun to his head and my father assured him that either his brains, or his signature, would be on the contract. That's a true story. That's my family, Kay, it's not me. It's only the women-units, like Kay Adams who are confused and who need to be reminded, every once in a while. Kay ventures to open her mouth about politics and her naive liberalism is met with a quick back fist of REALITY by Michael Corleone, (who art her husband and budding patriarch in his own right, amen).MC: My father is no different than any other powerful man -- any man who's responsible for other people, like a senator or president. KAY: You know how naive you sound...senators and presidents don't have men killed. MC: Oh, who's being naive, Kay? That's it girls and the rest of you liberals and socialists. The richest one percent of the families in the USA own more of the well, no, I mean wealth, than the other ninety-percent of American families. For this, they get the best government money can buy. And, if someone stands in their way with some left-leaning line, well we know what happens to them.As Barzini says to the other Dons about sharing the spoils from the well of exploitation: Certainly, he can present a bill for such services. After all, we're not Communists. But he must let us draw the water from the well. Get it you softies? This is social darwinism in action, reduced to its simplest formula and ground down to its final solution. This is reality of THE GAME : dominance and submission, master and servant, the Godfather and you.Meanwhile, true women can talk about the kids, especially about the up and coming males. She can cook and clean. This is her place. She knows nothing about the realities of politics. It is a dog-eat-dog world outside of her properly protected areas of concern : with the kids, in the kitchen and at church.Don't get me wrong. This is a great flick. The acting was the best that most of these men ever did or would do. Of course, the women were a bit hollow. But that role fit the script. Francis Ford Coppola's direction was masterful as was his collaboration with Mario Puzo on the screenplay. The cinematography by Gordon Willis was appropriately brown, dark and conservative. The casting by Louis DiGiamio, Andrea Eastman and Fred Roos was near perfect.Brando's last scene in 'The Godfather' was really the classic moment. But then, there were so many. Anyway, remember? He and his grandson playing in the garden. First Vito sprays the bugs. He pushes the device. Out comes the death spray. Down go the bugs. Then, he gives the push-spray gun to little Michael's son. The cute thing chases his grandfather around spraying insect killer at him like it was some kind of Tommy Gun until, boom, the old ticker gives out and Brando collapses. The kid doesn't know he's dead yet and so steps up to the body and sprays it some more. Rather like the last moments in Sonny's untimely death, no? Oh well, like father, like son.",9,0,2,8 April 2006
