Iron Man 3," A fitting 'end'
","I'm not one to use superlatives, I hate it, eventually it becomes dry and loses meaning however, with Iron Man 3. Its a masterpiece.Since the 'Avengers' stunned the world I've been eager to watch the next chapter, as a huge Marvel fan I was not going to miss this. The movie is brilliant, the plot is genius! I won't mention too many spoilers but be warned the following contains some:Positives: 1: Downey is superb as Stark 2: Cheadle is simply brilliant 3: Guy Pearce really shines as Killian 4: Harley was great 5: The Mandarin 'reveal' was hilarious 6: The humor is great and not overused 7: The plot is superb 8: The visuals are stunningNegatives: 1: My only complaint is the lack of MENTION as to where S.H.I.E.LD are.Many believe this to be the final Iron Man movie and Downey will only appear in the Avengers sequels. If so, they couldn't have done it better. This is simply one of the best, only beaten by the Avengers. Amazing.",8,30,52,19 May 2013
Man of Steel," You won't believe a man can fly, you will believe a man will fly.
","Before we start this let me tell you, I'm a 14 year-old boy who last year got into Marvel. I watched Avengers and to this day I hailed it the greatest and best film ever. Man Of Steel has sucker-punched it to #2 (See what I did there?)Man Of Steel is a wonderful story of an Aliens (Clark Kent/Kar-El portrayed by Henry Cavill) struggle to keep his powers under control despite being able to help humanity.The movie starts with a brilliant sequence depicting the doomed planet Krypton facing an apocalypse, we see the simply brilliant Jor-El (Kals father and portrayed by Russell Crowe) mull over the destruction of an highly advanced Utopia. Synder beautifully portrays it as a Utopia ravaged and in tatters. Next we see the birth of Superman himself as it turns out he is the only natural birth in centuries. I won't ruin too much so allow me to 'summarise' the story. Jor pleads with the Kryptonian council to hand him control so he can ensure the race survives however they refuse. And Que on time marches in Zod (Played by one of my favorites, Michael Shannon) along with several menacing rebels including Faora, who goes on to have a pivotal role in the film. He promptly executes a councilor and declares he shall save the planet before offering Jor the chance to work with him. He refuses.I won't reveal much more about the plot but here are the pros & cons: 1: Michael Shannon is simply great as Zod, his maniacal eyes and desire to save his race are true and relatable however he is nonetheless the foe, I also love how several shots zoom on his face to emphasis his rage. 2: Cavill is great as Clark/Superman, I had doubts, I was wrong. 3: For those saying Amy Adams isn't utilized well are wrong, she isn't there for 'image' she plays a key role and has some great scenes. 4: The effects and fighting are glorious. 5: ZIMMER! 7: The whole 'darn cast. 8: EVERYTHINGNegatives: N/AI'm not one for superlatives or praising everything but it has to be said Man Of Steel is the best 'superhero' film I've seen, I say this because I see it more as sci-fi bit I digress. You will love this film, you will love the characters and you will believe a man will fly.Its beyond description, there's no word to describe it.",10,2,4,22 June 2013
