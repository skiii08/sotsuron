Ghost," Very Well-Researched!
","The writers for this film obviously thoroughly researched what is known about ghosts.  I understand that they checked with Tibetan Buddhist monks on what someone is likely to encounter in the 'bardo state,' after death.  Over many centuries, Tibetan Buddhism has compiled countless data about this.
A more recent film which shows similar depth of research is 'The Sixth Sense' (1990).",10,1,2,10 September 1999
