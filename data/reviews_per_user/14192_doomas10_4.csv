The Expendables 2," They are back - this time they bring noise!
","So here comes the masterpiece that 'Expendables 2' is. Not really no. Far from masterpiece. But the thing is, it is an absolute blast from start to finish literally. The first chapter wasn't that bad at all but the excessive amounts of CGI bood, the terrible special effects and the quick/cut fight scenes betrayed the purpose of the film. Instead of being a massive throwback to the 80's clich√©d and unbelievable flawed action flicks, it felt a mis-mash of seriousness - first half - and goofy fun -parodic action sequences in the second half. 'Expendables 2' does not repeat the same mistakes. Simon West who knows two or three things about action ('Con air'), relies and mostly succeeds in delivering high octane action blasts. Every possible gun is on screen and on use. Vehicles such as tanks, choppers, bikes, trucks, aeroplanes and jeeps are blown up into tiny little pieces in glorious fashion through massive and loud set pieces. The film is rated 15 here in UK so you get to see bloody shootouts that may remind you some of the chaotic sequences in ...wait for it...'Hard Boiled' (not choreographed though). What makes E2 that much fun is the unique combination between all these (mostly) old and new stars. Sylvester Stallone still has it and it is remarkable that he doesn't try to focus too much on his character or to a potential love interest (Yu Nan - more on her later) because that would look ridiculous. The rest of the cast are great, particularly Dolf Lungren who kinda steals the show with one liners and weird facial expressions. However, the biggest sensation....comes from Jean Claude Van Damme as the psychotic Jean Villain!?. Not only the actor is having a blast as the primary villain, he is actually sensational. Every time he is on screen, he actually acts more like Villain and not as Van Damme. His presence is kinda magnetic and his physical mannerisms very interesting. I cant believe i am saying this. Sure he is not going to get any awards for that performance, but it is a) a nice change, b) good to see him on the big screen again and c) actually a pretty decent villain. Van Damme FTW! Willis and Arnie have more to do this time and it is really cool to see three of the biggest action stars of all time to kick some serious amounts of ass by blowing up buildings, destroying walls or ... by driving Smarts!Biggest disappointment comes from Jet Li though! He is merely in the film for 10 minutes and then he is gone (that's no spoiler btw). In the first film, most complaints aimed at Jet Li's character who didn't have a particular scene to shine. Here West understood this and gives him a whole new sequence with frying pans to do something. His exit from the team early makes room for Yu Nan's Chinese agent who is simply to put it terrible. Never convincing for a special agent, her line delivery is astonishingly bad, her relationship with Barney awkward and frankly i did not care for her. She is out of place and looks confused all the time. The filmmakers should have tried to get Michelle Yeoh for that part!The fight sequences are better this time around (highlight the airport shootout), the action bigger and better and the actors seem to have more fun. Quieter scenes when these characters are talking and interacting to each other with jokes and philosophical talks are always a plus in an overloaded action film as we actually tend to like them and they do not come cheesy. E2 is not a terrible film but neither a very good one. In fact it is not even a good one. But it is a decent effort against to all those boring CGI infested action films of the last couple of years with a great cast and some AWE-inspiring set pieces. And any film that makes Van Damme cool again, is considered awesome.",6,3,9,16 August 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Brilliant film!
","Now 'The winter soldier' is everything a Captain America movie should be. While it maintains some of the humour that now has become the trademark of Marvel films, TWS is way more serious than all of them combined. And this is truly where the film feels so brave and yes different than any other superhero flicks that we have seen. Which brings me to the most important point, the plot. While of course it is not going to be the most original or complicated film of the century, there is the basic screen writing elements that so much lack from modern day blockbusters. You have the (likable) characters and a mystery they need to solve along with a racing clock. It reminded me the 70's political paranoia thrillers (3 days of the Condor - another Redford link, The parallax view, Z) and it is a welcome tone that makes the WS to differentiate itself from the rest. There are strong scenes regarding political fear, control, and information manipulation but it never feels bloated or overbearing. the purpose is to entertain even if it manages to squeeze through a bit of political views with Rogers replacing the viewer's voice on screen. At one point there is a talk about who is who which results in every man for himself mayhem in one of the most interesting sequences that you may see this year. We do not get this stuff these days!Besides the charged plot, the introduction of new characters and the mega mayhem in the streets of Washingthon DC, the Russos have found time (and they should bloody do since TWS is 2 and a half hours long!) to inject some sentiments in the proceedings - a visit to Peggy, a confrontation with Fury regarding SHIELDs actions, Bucky's memory recall, Natasha's kissing talk. They could have easily skip these 'crap' but instead the extra running time feels adjusted and coherent with a bit of more characterization which results to bring us closer to the on screen counterparts. However, the action is what took me by surprise. The bar has been set higher now. It is truly unbelievable to think that these two directors (of the 'Community' fame) came with such inventive ways of using Cap's shield. Finally, the shield gets to be seen in all of its glory. In addition, all the fist fights (and they are many) are excellent examples and putting the glasses to the school of frantic edit (which I truly despise) with varied and rapid choreography. A terrific elevator fight sequence probably stands out as truly memorable whereas the encounters with the Winter Soldier never feel repetitive. The Russo brothers keep changing the game from stealth and cloak missions, to car chases, to gun fires, to dog fights, to fist fights. There is something for everyone here and it is arguably among the finest I have seen. Impressive considering their credits. Real stunt work (backflips, wrestle moves, somersaults, etc), real fights and it is a pleasing sight to go away from superhero duels of the Avengers, Thor and Iron man. These characters rely on instincts and bullets. No more and no less and most of them do have some brutal moments for a PG-13 film (and blood too).The actors are absolutely brilliant in their roles. While Evans came out as a bit arrogant in the 'Avengers' and the least interesting character, here he truly shines. First time ever, I actually bought what he was bringing on the table. This is a soldier who believed in protecting the people and their freedom. Here though, in the modern era of espionage with multiple intrigues and political events, he finds himself unable to identify which side he is on and for what. At one point he even considers himself Fury's caretaker of terrorist 'problems'. The other side of the coin is Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury and Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce. It is nice to see Jackson expanding his role from 1 minute cameo in 'Iron Man' to a fully supporting actor here. But the real standout is Robert Redford. Kevin Feige (the producer) probably knows how to do casting because so far there has not been a single acting mistake. Bringing heavy-acting-weight Redford to a superhero film is actually a bold move and while most movies do not focus on the talented cast, here the Russo brothers give Redford plenty of close ups and necessary gravitational dialogue that kept surprised me for a 'summer' and 'mindless' blockbuster. Antony Mackie plays Falcon believably enough and it is very good to see a great supporting turn instead of being the comedic sidekick. The winter soldier now himself is as you would have expected? probably the best villain outside Loki(!) in the marvel films. A truly unstoppable and cool killing machine that shows no remorse or regret considering his complete disregard (and destructive) actions throughout the film. Shaw manages to bring a bit of menace to a generally light hearted series of fantasy films as he has to act more with his eyes rather than sharing any scenes of actual dialogue. Is it perfect? Of course not but it does not feel that it is drugging forever or raising any boring flags. There is plenty of plot, intelligence and sweet characters moments to keep anyone satisfying. This is blockbuster at its finest, a superhero film with heart, immersive action and subtle touches of humour. Totally recommended.",10,295,449,27 March 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," An emotional and satisfying conclusion
","'The dark knight rises' isn't the perfect film but it is definitely the most emotional of all three. Yeah i said it (but neither were the previous two). But i would be lying if i was telling you that i did not have goosebumps in numerous scenes or wet eyes during some of the most honestly acting (and touching) moments in the history of cinema. This time around, Bruce Wayne is being tested mentally and physically against Bane and his hordes for the salvation (or destruction) of Gotham city. However, what really works here and makes all the way through our heart and emotions are the sharply drawn and fleshed out characters. There will be people claiming that there is an large number of individuals that take lots of screen time, yet they actually feel and act as normal 'humans' rather than archetypical Hollywood algorithms. Christian Bale should get a nomination for his work as Bruce Wayne. This is his finest Batman. You really root for him simply because like all of us, he has limits (spiritual and physical), limits that will be broken. On the antagonist part, Tom Hardy as Bane is physically impressive. Make no mistake. This is not a well built body with perfect abs and biceps in order to lure teenage girls to the cinema. Instead Nolan's Bane is a colossal muscle mountain that could snap your spine in a split second without making the slightest of effort. Just like the edgy and twitchy Joker, his unique body language and swaggering mannerisms will certainly leave an impact to the viewer's mind and rightly to do so. However, do i hear show stealer? Anne Hathaway - she is a fully lethal, sexy ass kicking babe. I cannot believe i am writing this but she was incredible! Of course she cannot fill Michelle Pfeiffer's (iconic) shoes simply because in the Tim Burtonland, Catwoman was a demented, emotionally scarred woman with certain supernatural status at the background and played more like a tragic villain. Here, Hathaway plays Selena Kyle as a sexy, independent, thief that is balancing between good and bad all the way through the film. A fitting antihero and blurred line between Batman's justice and Bane's menace. What i really enjoyed is how similar she looks, sounds, talks and moves like her counterpart in the animated series, comics and videogames. She is even waving that ass with a cat like pose. I absolutely loved this character!The rest of the (multiple) cast are doing what they are doing best servicing the reliable (and sometimes surprising) story written by Nolan and Goyer. Both have done their homework with Nolan's direction becoming even more confident than before. His camera sweeps and embraces the vast cityscape of Gotham, day and (much more impressively) in the night. His exquisite taste for night time shots is something that deserves the IMAX ticket alone and brings back memories when Michael Mann used to be a cool director. But what about the script? How can a film surpass the heavy expectations of the Oscar worthy 'Dark knight'? Wel, it doesn't, but instead it goes around them. How do you follow that? You can't. Thus Nolan and co-s have done the wise decision of not repeating themselves terminating unwanted comparisons with the previous installments. The first entry was focused to the personal spiritual odyssey of a man and the second evolved into a crime thriller about masked vigilantes and themes of anarchy fused with (in)justice. On the other hand, the third chapter goes back to conclude the journey and the degenerated anarchy, brings back everything (and everyone) together and ties them nicely in the vast present of terrorism and economic prevalence (in a lesser degree). The Joker was full of surprises and meaningless through his performance reflecting the psychotic personality. Bane has a plan - to destroy Gotham city, to live in order to see its ashes. He doesn't want chaos, he wants order through chaos which is an interesting concept. The layout of anger, injustice, blurred morality (chase the Batman the vigilante or the robbers?) and motives is displayed through a complex array of events and almost possible situations (military law anyone?) that can be thought provoking and mind feeding. Certain twists and turns do exist to maintain our thrilling interest to the sky but if you are a devoted Batman comic book guy, then you know kinda the story. 'The dark knight rises' reaches superior film level status when it comes to powerful emotional scenes and outstanding sequences that will have your heart filled with grief and your sentiments exploding (for spoiler reasons i cannot mention any of these). The exceptional score by Hans Zimmer underlines and sometimes more than enough enhances the power of the unfolding events on screen into our mind. The A-class acting manages to inject real pathos and drama into the proceedings and this is what lacks from the movies nowdays. A good story, a fantastic cast and a large group of crew members that could make films like these possible. The movie is exceptionally shot, the action is plenty and more epic than before and the fight sequences between Batman and Bane are astonishing, especially their first encounter.'The dark knight rises' is an experience and should be seen in IMAX. There is ground here for even more psychological exploration and doubts about moral responsibilities that could reflect into our reality. This is a fitting and satisfying conclusion to the legend of the dark knight. Probably the world's best trilogy?",10,16,34,20 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A remake of episode IV
","Story: the script written by Abraams himself along with Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote 'Empire' and 'Jedi') is a solid block of fan service towards Episode IV. It follows identical story patterns - desert planet, kid ready to go off on adventure, mentor comes along the way,etc - but some nice (humorous) twists left and right. Although it delivers with no cringe-worthy scenes, Abraams seems to be focused too much in 'New Hope' as he tries avoid the (hilarious) wrath of the internet fan boys. Whereas this is not necessarily a bad decision, it would be been a greater challenge to try to distinguish his film from old ties and allow himself to follow our (old and new) heroes in different settings rather than familiar ones. Of course, this is Star Wars, it had never been about breaking the rules or groundbreaking story material, it is all about family relationships. Themes: The character interaction is worth the price of the admission alone and it is simply magical to see all those icons that you love talking to each. Main focus here remains the connections between them and the family ties that each one may carry on their shoulders. It had always been a eye catching dynamic that has been explored in the last six films successfully - how Luke reacts to his father's news, how Anakin is going to save Padme, etc - and if it is not broken why fix it? Abraams knows he has a goldmine of characters the audience is willing to see in action surrounded by love, betrayal, friendship, care and heroism and commits rightfully so.Characters: Episode VII boasts a phenomenal cast - from the main protagonist duo to the film's primary villain. It's a pleasure to have Harrison Ford back as Han Solo with the most scene stealing moments and his chemistry with Fisher and Mayhew (Chewbacca) still holds strong since 1983. It is evident that Ford is having a blast at the iconic role and it seems that it has not passed a day since the concluding events of the 'Return of the Jedi'. Carrie Fisher has little screen time (unexpectedly) but does justice to the material and regarding Mark Hamill's appearance much cannot be said without giving anything away. Among the newcomers, Daisy Ridley makes a strong impact - likable, fierce and vulnerable - she brings a freshness to the Star Wars myths by being almost at the center of the story in a rather dominant boy- ish series. John Boyega is surprisingly charismatic (and amps the humor to 11!) although his character is rather blunt sometimes and feels like filler. Other wellknown cast members are either minimized cameos - Max Von Sydow, Gwendoline Christie come to mind, what a waste!, or glorified ones - looking at you Oscar Isaac. and this is where the film mostly crumbles. An overabundance of characters offer almost nothing at the proceedings instead they are used as an excuse to move the plot forward. It is admirable that Abraams tries to recreate a vivid world of Star Wars but at one point, we are not caring for most of them as they carry almost no significance or dramatic weight.Villain: The best element in the film, main player here is Kylo Ren portrayed by Adam Driver. A rather menacing (and badass) presence, his story arc is by far the most interesting with some nifty emotional touches. Driver plays Ren's obsession/confusion to perfection and surely has the most development in the movie. Not only, he summarizes what is wrong with the dark side, tiny little details regarding his emotional attributes build up his character without requiring much heavy handed exposition or long monologues. At this part, Abraams and Co have succeeded tremendously and Driver's performance carries a dramatic (and tragic) weight reminding the glory of 'Revenge of the Sith''s final act.Direction: Abraams' direction is solid, dynamic and evidently from the Star Trek entries serviceable with similar blended display of CGI and practical effects. However, despite the presence of some inspiring dog fight sequences, Abraams seems to struggle with the lightsaber battle suffering from close ups and intense edit despite the atmospheric setting. It is always good to see no lens flare! - thank you for that - and him trying to keep consistent with the visual flare of the previous films. Following George Lucas's directing (and static) style with a bit of more dramatic movement in the space scenes feels like a natural evolution for a modern entry in the SW canon. Particularly, there is a wonderful shot of Finn fighting his way through a Stormtrooper squad while on the background Dameron is blasting lasers on Tie-fighters. Brilliant. however, it does not bring back any memorable moments due to his insistence to follow the patterns of Episode IV. Although there is a clear enthusiasm, he gets caught in his own excitement to recreate probably his nostalgia. All six films boasted some truly memorable set pieces (Vader vs Luke in Empire, Duel of the fates scene, pd race, Emperor confrontation in Jedi) or visual style (who can forget the almost renaissance like lava landscapes of Mustafar?), yet here, despite the state of the art talent involved, the films feels more a fan service checklist rather than a fully fleshed out adventure.Despite being a technical thrill and a treat for the holiday season, Episode VII though lacks any emotional punch while it is focused on pulling off the nostalgia flag rather than initiate excitement with something new. Abraams has done a serviceable job as the franchise's first helmer with adequate action scenes and a great cast. He falls short though as he sidelines interesting personalities, events and mini plots threads at the expense of the fan service with a blink and you miss ending that sets up further entries.",6,28,57,16 December 2015
