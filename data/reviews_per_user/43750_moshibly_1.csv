Sucker Punch," a sucker
","I voted 6 stars for 2 reasons only, the CGI and the soundtrack... if it wasn't for the mentioned above reasons, the film would be unwatchable, the story is lame and predictable. The first 10 minutes of the movie were very very promising but unfortunately it took a turn to the worse. Started out as a dark movie with a complicated plot, which turned out to be an extended PS3 gameAnyways its worth watching once. The fight scenes are nice though, exactly like video games with 'easy mode' on, killing thousands and left unhurt.4 stars for the story and 8 for special effects and soundtrack.. an average of 6 stars for the whole movie",5,17,39,22 March 2011
