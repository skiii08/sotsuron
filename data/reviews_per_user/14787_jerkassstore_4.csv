Blade Runner 2049," Not bad... but obviously too slow.
","Most of the movie is pretty good. But I'm just going to write about it's 1 major flaw. The pace.So, I'm reading about how this movie isn't reaching 'box office expectations'. Really? You think!? One of the main issues with this movie is the same reason why the original Blade Runner bombed at the box office! Why would you make the same mistake twice? Look, the movie was not bad but it's WAY TOO SLOW. Did it really have to be? Why? Preserve the style, legacy or some such other b.s? At least it could've been slightly faster than the original but it's actually slower. What was Villeneuve thinking? As an aspiring filmmaker I'm blow away. Because I can tell you that if you told me what the budget of this movie was and had me watch it before release, I'd have been VERY worried.I don't get it.",7,2,5,9 October 2017
A Star Is Born," Wow, Lady Gaga!!
",I just wanted to say I am genuinely blown away how amazing Lady Gaga looks in this. I have never seen Gaga without makeup and I have to say what a natural beauty. I swear in God's name she is incredible. I hope to see more of her like this. Thank you.,9,39,96,1 September 2018
Warrior," Simple movie caters to simple fight fans
","I can't believe all the good reviews of this movie. Everyone seems to love the performances. They were good I guess. Nothing to really write home about. What about the story itself? It's boring. There's barely anything here that you haven't seen elsewhere. It all seems so generic right down to the aesthetics. Even when I first read the script I thought it was boring and generic. It wasn't even written that well. But yes, this is Hollywood, let's just replace boxing with MMA. And now it's on the IMDb top 250!? Is this some kind of a joke. There are many movies more deserving to be on the list than this. This is a simple movie that caters to simple MMA fans and I guess it won them over.",5,4,9,26 February 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," come on man... come on!!!
","Tarantino's has lost it. He's simply just lost it. Like, what're you doing??? His last good movie was Django unchained. He's done. You're done, buddy. I was fun while it lasted...Who does this? Structurally, ok? Basic, how to make a movie 101. Let's just throw that out the window. Look, it's one thing to be influenced by the 60's, but to make a movie as if it came straight out of the 60's? There's a reason nobody in their right mind makes movies like that anymore. It has to do with objective data on what audiences respond to. But screw that. Just do whatever you want, right? Dun du-ruh du-ruh. How slow can you go!! For Christ sakes. Speed it the F up. Let's go. MOVE IT.Let's say for the sake of arguement that the pace was brisker. Even then, it's still... I don't know. What is this?Oh, I forgot to mention. Bruce Lee loses a fight in this. He gets beaten up. That's insulting and fundamentally outrageous beyond all humanity. Nobody wants to see that and nobody believes it. It's unbelievable.",6,9,28,1 August 2019
