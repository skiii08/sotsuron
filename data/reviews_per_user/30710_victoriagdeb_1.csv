Marie Antoinette," 'An excellent way of giving life to the story of the last queen of France, Marie Antoinette'
","I really liked how Sofia Coppola, the director, has communicated with this movie the incredible and exiting story of the last queen of France. This movie is based on a book and she, the director, perfectly gave it life in this brilliant movie. I personally think that the soundtrack and the clothing of this movie were really well chosen and that the point of view of the story was really open minded. They did this movie in the real palace of Versailles, which makes it a lot more real. The cast was also really well chosen, Kristen Dust was perfect as the character of Marie Antoinette, a 14-year-old Austrian Princess that has to go marry the future king of France (Louis XVI) to close the alliance between France and Austria, with her stunning expression and amazing way of acting.When you watch 'Marie Antoinette' you feel like it is a really romantic and exiting story with all the beautiful dresses, the incredible food, the amazing castle of Versailles, the diamonds, the Champaign, the breath-taking parties Â… but at the same time, when all the sparkle ends, that it is also a really dramatic movie.",10,2,4,25 August 2014
