It," Amazing new look at Pennywise and the Losers Club.
","I have to look at this film as a completely separate film than the original with the brilliant Tim Curry, because it is a different film and a different time.1st of all, Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise is amazing! What stood out the most was the way he made that his character, and didn't try and redo a Tim Curry Pennywise. Everything from his eyes, to his towering height and child like presence made me an instant fan!I enjoyed the losers club, although not as much as I did in the original mini series and I'm not sure why. A couple of the characters were unable to convince me of their characters where as in the original, all of the loosers were in fact loosers.My only problem that I would have with this film would have been certain scenes with CGI that didn't look that great.Overall, awesome remake of a classic horror story!",10,0,1,31 January 2019
