Scarface," 'Her womb is so polluted she can't have any kids.'
","Some people actually compare this and the 1932 version, which goes to show that human stupidity is both limitless and fascinating. Apples and oranges, almost. Pacino manages what no-one could have done with Tony Montana: he is both convincing as a real Latino gangster AND hilarious to watch. There are so many gems coming out of Montana's mouth, I really sometimes laughed so hard I thought I was watching a comedy. Of course, real gangsters often are funny in this sort of idiotic way, being the kind of mostly short-lived raw imbeciles with zero education and manners. However, Pacino never comes off as a clown. This ranks as one of the best performances ever.The reason this movie is head-and-shoulders above all of De Palma's idiotic thrillers is that: A) Palma does good mob films (see 'Carlito's Way') and B) he did not write the script - thank God. Surprisingly enough, none other than Oliver Stoned wrote this wonderful piece. Apparently, Stoned's head was not clouded with cocaine, much like Tony Montana's, back in the late 70s and early 80s. (Unlike now: see 'Alexander' and 'Nixon'.) The only criticisms I have is that some parts of the movie are visually unappealing, i.e. the photography is weak, and that those American truck-driver's rock songs cheapen the soundtrack greatly.Close to 3 hours of great fun.",Null,1,2,9 September 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Looks like a bunch of bored, unemployed skinhead morons decided to 'gang up' on this comment... 0 out of 40. Good luck with the lobotomies!
","I've known the character of Borat since 2000, when I discovered Sascha Baron Cohen and his equally funny Ali G character. But while his Ali G movie wasn't as good as the TV show, the Borat movie is as good as anything I've seen previously from that character. It is incredibly refreshing to FINALLY come across a great comedy, the genre being virtually dead since the 90s. (And, not surprisingly, it is once again not a Hollywood product that is this hilarious.) The film will offend many, but probably only those who take themselves and life far too seriously (and, of course, many Kazak people). The film lasts only 80 minutes, which is a relief, because it offers a non-stop barrage of terrific verbal and sight gags, and any longer than that would have been unbearable. I quite literally had to watch the film with pauses, in order to calm down a bit and catch my breath. It isn't just a silly movie. It is a far cleverer satire than some people may realize at first. Sascha Baron Cohen, himself a Jew, has exposed the stupidity of (newly rising) anti-Semitism, and in the best and most original way I have ever seen. In fact, some of my personal favourites from the movie are precisely scenes dealing with hatred and fear of Jews. The movie is also politically incorrect, and this is a great part of the reason why it's so good. No black female judges in court-rooms in this oneIf you're an anti-Semite, click 'NO' for this review...",Null,1,47,2 January 2007
Gremlins," Dante and Spielberg just couldn't resist the urge.
","A big hit when it came out, 'Gremlins' has stood the test of time quite well. There's a visual quality and mood to the movie that makes it a cut above many such fantasy-based 80s films, some of which look decidedly dated by now. The creatures look real and behave in an interesting/amusing rather than predictable way.Those of us who enjoyed it as kids back then can now 'appreciate' its subversive nature – at least people that are clueless naive liberals in search of the millionth movie to feature an anti-Capitalist message. (Actually, 1,000,000 might be more of a low estimate. Check out my 'Left-Wing Propaganda in TV & Cinema' list for more on this.) This anti-American message is so subliminal, so obscured by the thick layers of the movie's Disney-wise cartoon-like shenanigans, that it can only be detected by those who pay attention to such things, i.e. viewers who are fully aware of how rampant left-wing propaganda was/is/always-will-be in American (but also European) movies. The fact that Joe Dante and Stevie Spielberg were director and producer, respectively, makes perfect sense inasmuch that they're both flaming closet Marxists. What doesn't make sense at all is that those two joined up and actually gave us a quality product. Spielberg had said 'au revoir' to quality after 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981), whereas Dante had only ever made one very good movie – this one. 'The Howling' and 'Gremlins 2' are merely solid, the rest of his filmography ranges from mediocre to utterly commercial pap.What's left-wing about it? 1) The town's witch/ogre is also its richest person (rich people are evil, unless they happen to be Communist dictators or Beverly Hills leftists, in which case they are noble and perfect); a woman more than happy to render as many people homeless in her town as she can, plus she's the widow of a stock-market millionaire – and we know how very evil Wall Street and anything even remotely associated with profit-making is (unless of course a Hollywood film-maker is making millions of profit: that doesn't count). (Btw, her character is a shameless rip-off (or 'tribute', ha ha) of the evil witch from 'Wizard of Oz'.) 2) The Chinaman (whose own country is Communist; I don't know whether this was intentional or whether it was the 'exotic bonus' they were after) scolds the all-American family, giving them a brief but stern lecture as to why they do not deserve to have a wonderful creature such as the 'mogwai', because, in the Chinaman's words: 'your society isn't ready for it'. In other words, American society is too evil, what with its free democratic society and a successful Capitalist system that had enabled it to become among the wealthiest countries in the world (a fact that far-Left liberals like Spielberg and other like-minded Hollywood chums of his simply can't stomach – in spite of the fact that HIS career is as Capitalist in nature as Henry Ford's!). 3) When the sheriff makes a comment about how patriotic Gizmo is, he misses out on the way in which the little critter was playing with the American flag – namely with a touch of disgust. Fortunately, the laughable political messages of the three deranged men involved with the movie's script, direction and production is too hidden to ruin the entertainment value.",Null,2,7,3 January 2013
Requiem for a Dream," The pretentious title alone will impress many among the clueless... including everyone's favourite Discovery Channel 'punk', Henry Rollins.
","'Requiem For a Turd'.I can't shake off the nasty feeling that this is yet another thinly disguised attack at modern America (hence Capitalism), presenting it in a hysterically negative light, exaggerating every step of the way with absurdly immoral doctors, cops, and just about everyone else. A bleak mood is all well and fine, but let's not get carried away...In fact, I checked out Hubert Selby's biography - and 'surprise': yet another anti-American American. 'Last Exit To Brooklyn' is also manic, laughable and designed to be controversial rather than intelligent. The fact that this talentless writer has been championed by people such as Allen Ginsberg and Henry Rollins really says it all... Henry Rollins has a brain the size of a peanut.As if it weren't bad enough that Aronofsky thought that no-one else had covered drug use in movies before - what with same-old-same-old clichés of junkies stealing, dealing, and drooling - but the movie actually uses drug addiction as a cover to criticize the medical profession and law enforcement in a way in which an ignorant, radicalized, and endlessly naive 17 year-old hippie normally would. America - as seen through the eyes of someone who is so very disillusioned with his country. That moves me to tears. Really touching. Please hand me a handkerchief, the tears are threatening to drown me! Maybe the writers should move to Zambia, Colombia, or Mongolia and see how they like it there... See what a cruel life is really all about, the spoilt whining ninnies...Requiem of a dream? Quite clearly it's the American Dream that is meant here.I have always been amazed how so many people, both Americans and non-Americans, misunderstand the idea of the American Dream. They think that in theory it guarantees everyone success and a happy and prosperous life. That's utter nonsense, of course. Only Marxists believe in such a JohnLennonian world. All four central characters in ROAD have sub-par intelligence, which is obvious from almost everything they say - and do (especially). America doesn't and cannot guarantee everyone to realize their potential, simply because some people don't have any! Every society is going to have its misfits, losers - and whiners.It's hard not to see the laughable irony in Aronofsky - a man living the America Dream, for all practical purposes - making a movie in which he proclaims the notion to be dead. However, as far as Selby is concerned, I can understand him to an extent: this man had been bed-ridden and seriously ill for most of his life so I can understand how bitter that can make a person become... This is no excuse, of course.Sure the States has a health care problem, but to so one-sidedly portray all those involved in it as parasites and lunatics is going a bit too far. ROAD is also complete with the obligatory Southern racist cop who so very predictably hits Wayans for no reason and calls him a 'nigger'. Selby's novel 'The Room' is about evil cops imprisoning innocent people (according to liberals, a thing that happens 150,000 times a day).The only reason I gave this pretentious drama 3 points is because there was at least some attempt at experimentation (otherwise ROAT would have been an extremely dull movie) and for the very interesting soundtrack.I wasn't too thrilled with the cast picked here. Jared Leto, yet another bland androgynous midget, an always overrated Burstyn, plus I also have to question the intelligence in picking a Wayans brother - and Marlon at that! - to play in a heavy-handed drama like this. If you want to make a serious drama, a word of advice: GET SOME SERIOUS ACTORS.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Yoda's list.
","'On WEBSTER'S ALL-TIME MEDICLORIANS LIST in 2nd place am I – not that boast do I want. Here the complete list is: 1. Anakin: by mere 3 mediclorians beat me did he, tell me my informants do, so argued did I that I with him places must switch when lost his left hand he did; after all, that hand at least 5% of all his mediclorians must have had, hence lost 5% of his body and mediclorians did he, argued I - therefore no.1 I should be. Never happened, unfortunately – outvoted in the Jedi council 1 to 9 the motion was... 2. The Reverend Grand Master Wizard Yoda The Ruler Of All Galaxies He Is (thought of adding 'fantastic' between 'master' and 'wizard' I had, but too pretentious would it have sounded); drank mediclorian juice my whole life I did, but never did it increase my mediclorian index (MI) in order to overtake Vader. 3. Leia: the damn woman never her potential did use (regret do I very much saying 'no there is another (hope)' in 1980) She hopeless is. 4. Luke: had sex with Leia he almost did, but luckily Han the solo guy snatched her away; incest rare in space is because so many planets to choose from there are, so why own family have sex with? Some in the Jedi Council to mate them wanted, which result in children with extraordinary MI would – but opposed I was to this idea from the start (I couldn't let that happen: their offspring reduce me into 3rd or 4th place on this list would have). 5. Count Dooku: kick his tall derrière I did in 'Star Wars: Of The Clones The Attack Is', but include the scene where I boot him in the groin Lucas did not, after which whimper like a school-girl Dooku did. 6. Sam Jackson: thank God a black one ('American-African' in our galaxy does not exist) in the 10 Top there is, or accusations of racism never shaken off Lucas would have; ever wonder why 'Master Windu' we call him? F**ts to distract opponents during light-sabre duels uses he. A very clever cookie was he... 7. Darth Vader's sister, Cretina: born semi-mentally-challenged, never quite the hang of the Force did she get; a pompous black costume never did she wear but asthma like her brother had she, too. After accidentally drooling on Emperor Palantine, had her removed from the Death Star Vader did (last was she seen in a brawl with Steven Spielberg when a part he offered her in 'The Purple Colour'); embarrassed by her Lucas is and ignore her completely he has, the damn nerd... 8. Sofia Coppola: on the Jedi council was she even, but doubt do I about her having that many mediclorians: methinks her father buy the results did; nepotism a problem in the Jedi world is, too, not just in distant Hollywood. 9. Chewbacca: surprised all of you are, know I, but a simple explanation there is: an abundance of mediclorians does the hairy bastard have, but in his genitals concentrated they all are: only his pe*is controls the Force, hence his numerous affairs with thousands of orangutans, chimps, and lemurs even; no girl monkey to him 'no' can say.10. George Lucas: I know, confused you all must be, but $3,000,000,000 worth he is, and translated into mediclorians roughly 23,000 mediclorians that is; money as mighty as the Force can often be. 11. Obi-Wan Kenobi: an overachiever, if ever there one was; by a whisker into this list did he make it. Remember you might how much trouble had he in barely beating that silly little mercenary, Bubba Fatt (Bob a Jedi primary-school dropout was, scarcely tie his own shoe-laces could he, let alone the Force wield). And forget you probably can't that together fight with Quai-Gon against Darth Maul he had to – 2 against 1, both of them cowards were. A wig wear he did always, hence 'Moby' Wan Kenobi we used to call him for his baldness and stupidity; thelessnever, many Jedi always wonder did what trick of magic Kenobi utilized to transform from a Scottish man to an English one.' <ul><li>The Honourable Master Yoda</li></ul>",Null,3,7,12 July 2009
Spartacus," An idealized and dull version of Spartacus.
","Watched it again, nearly twenty years later, and I can't say I warmed to it much. I certainly didn't expect Ancient Rome to be shown in such a dark way as in 'Caligula' (especially not in 1960), but the story of the slaves who rebelled goes into the other extreme: it's pure Hollywood nonsense, unfortunately. Spartacus isn't bloodthirsty or ruthless enough; he is more like Moses than an ex-slave/gladiator. Out of all the slave women in Ancient Rome, Olivier has to have the one, i.e. has to fall for the exact same one that Spartacus loves. That is just a little too corny for my taste. The first third, with the training and the rebellion, is actually good, but from then on the pace is much too slow, there are some needless scenes, and the movie gets increasingly unrealistic. Plus, the ending is a downer. ('Braveheart', which is similar in its basic premise, length, and that it has also a downer ending, grips you; 'Spartacus' does nothing of the sort.) The casting is very good, though, with Olivier and Ustinov being particularly good. I see nothing here that would suggest that the best director of all time is behind the camera. Then again, Kubrick was only hired to direct this; i.e. this film wasn't one of his produce/direct/write projects. Also, it was years before he developed his unique style. It's his next movie. 'Lolita', that started a string of major classics.",Null,33,54,14 January 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Spielberg's Brown Monster.
","'This movie made my heart glad.' - Roger Ebert, film critic and gourmet.They say that the path to a fat man's heart goes through his over-sized belly, but sometimes the digested waste product of one called Spielberg can achieve the same result.When I was a kid I wanted to take a whiff of Spielberg's brown monster as much as the next kid. And I wasn't disappointed. I was only a clueless little brat at the time, what the hell did I know about cheesy Hollywood manipulation that makes you close your eyes (and nose) to the nonsense that surrounds the story of Spielberg's brown monster? However, many years later, and I discover that it's not all that it's CRACKed up to be. Plenty of stained holes in the script, and near every hole there's SBM sitting like the badly choreographed creature that it always was. A dumb kid called Elliott discovers SBM and goes all gooey and sentimental in no time. I didn't get it this time around: why would anyone in their right mind want to go anywhere near this film? It has a stench not unlike that of an over-crowded pig-sty.The main culprit for the bad taste left in my mouth after taking a sample of Spielberg's brown monster was not the midgety dinosaur himself. It was the annoying kids and the retarded clichés. First we have Drew Barrymore whose facial asymmetry was apparent as early as 1982. Think about it. And then think about what it means to be nepotistic offspring in Hollywood: it opens doors even for the least talented and least good-looking among us. Spielberg, who fathered the brown monster in one of his less-than-inspired bathroom moments, is also Drew's godfather. Not to mention all those relatives of hers, all infamous for their shoddy B-movie starring roles. All in the family... But I'm sure that Drew will always look back at this movie with fondness, knowing that it was E.T. that launched her nose into the seductive world of cocaine.So Elliott discovers SBM, invites it to his home, hides it from his parents (instead of flushing it, like any normal boy would), and then the evil adults and the government's wicked, knife-happy scientists kidnap SBM from right under his nose, hoping to anal-probe SBM as soon as possible. What exactly they'd hoped to find in SBM is beyond me. Clues to the director's digestive system? Judging from ET, the maker of 'Jaws' ate some rather strange foods in the early 80s...I will never understand the age-old movie cliché of the snip-happy scientists raring to have a stab at the noble alien creature, as if killing a one-of-a-kind specimen made any sense to even the most deranged sociopath, let alone an intelligent scientist.The other pathetic cliché is all of the kids being wise and good, the adults stupid and evil. Well, if that's the case, then why don't we put the little ones in charge of Wall Street and the economy? I think we should start by appointing Spielberg's own brood to run the White House... I do not doubt for a second that this would lead to a Utopic future society of almost Spielbergian proportions.'The creature, which looks a little like Snoopy...' - Roger Ebert, film critic and dog expert.I've read my share of Peanuts comics, but struggle to find any character there that even vaguely resembles the monster. But then again, Ebert also called this movie 'scary', so why wonder...Yes, and why wonder that Spielberg, of all people, should create such a brown monster. After all, he once told Barbra Streisand that 'Yentl' was the best movie he'd seen since 'Citizen Kane'.",Null,28,53,20 October 2008
Finding Neverland," Did Michael Jackson secretly finance this?
","Speak up!I wish some of the cast would have mumbled less, especially since some of them were doing accents other than their own. Do I have to crank up the volume as if on a metal concert in order to understand some of the lines? Whispering in movies is annoying, but unfortunately an increasing problem.But it's not the major problem here. FN is mostly manipulative schmaltz that Hollywood has served its sheepy audiences for nearly 100 years. Predictable every step of the way, which is unfortunate because the acting and the production values are good overall. At first I saw this as a typical family picture, but eventually realized it's tailor-made for women i.e. a typical syrupy chick-flick hence the movie's hysterically absurd high IMDb rating. Winslet dying young? But of course. Forget Princess Diana's tear-jerker funeral, get your handkerchiefs out for Winslet's overly melodramatic death. Based on true events, my butt.Having a main character die from a sudden illness while falling in love - especially when young - is one of the oldest clichés in the movie book, and shows a lack of imagination, which is ironic because one of this movie's main themes is having and maintaining imagination. If only the writers of this script had listened to their own credo, this might have been a more original and better movie.There are some dull moments as well, but these are mostly in the first half. At first I welcomed the fact that the four boys do not talk and behave like adults, but even this didn't last for the duration, because toward the end two of the boys started expressing themselves far too eloquently and intelligently for their respective age, which Depp 'rewarded' by telling the oldest Winslet son that he has become a man. Handkerchiefs! Why do film-makers assume that only intelligent (or super-intelligent) children deserve our sympathy? That's quite a bit of elitist thinking, when one thinks about it, especially for Hollywood's liberals who pretend to always side with the weak.I also find the casting of old people an increasing problem in Hollywood. Julie Christie's face looks very unnatural, due to weekly face-lifts, hence she comes off as a grotesque alien instead of as a woman that could be Winslet's mother. As an alien she can only lay eggs, and not give birth to beautiful women.Winslet looks great, as always, but she doesn't try very hard. A scene early on in which she says that she can't imagine how horrible it must be for kids to lose a mother is a good example of her laziness.Another problem with the movie is its typically Hollywoodesque twisting of the truth. I would have had no problems had they changed the names of all the characters at least. But they didn't. The writer of 'Peter Pan' was most probably a pedophile, and TWO of the boys committed suicide in real life. Wow! What a great 'dad' Barrie must have been!I guess Michael Jackson's pedophilia and his obsession with Neverland and the androgynous Peter Pan character must be in some way related to all this, but I just can't seem to figure out in what way...The next time MJ makes an appearance in court, being accused yet again of molesting little boys, his lawyers should play this movie to the jury to end the trial in two hours, hence save everyone the expenses of another sham of a celebrity trial.For a little bit of satire: http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/johnny_depp__a_biography",Null,5,12,2 October 2007
In Bruges," 'Psychopaths love their children, too'. Sure they do...
","It's extremely difficult to combine comedy and drama with any degree of success, and this would be IB's main drawback, even though the balance isn't bad as far as comedy-dramas go. We're supposed to get emotionally involved in various deaths here, and yet there are overly goofy scenes, too: the silliest being the one with the brave and stubborn pregnant hotel owner forcing Fiennes and Farrell to arrange how they'll organize the shoot-out; the resulting dialogue between the two belongs in an Eddie Murphy spoof, not this.Another problem is the director's somewhat unrealistic depiction of gangsters - and not just any ordinary criminals but cold-blooded killers. In an all-out comedy this would be forgiven, but when Gleeson shows genuine and deep interest in Belgian history, art, and architecture I have to wonder if McDonagh ever met any criminals, let alone spent some time with them. At least Farrell is portrayed as a typical gangster moron. I've also had trouble believing all these high morals and principles which apparently guide the lives of hardened gangsters. Gleeson, as far as we can tell, doesn't even know Farrell that well, and yet this hired hit-man risks life and limb to protect a SUICIDAL Farrell. There is absolutely no realism in this at all. (Apparently, it isn't just Hollywood films that glorify sociopaths.) Gleeson even becomes a martyr of sorts, which is simply daft. (Entertaining, but daft.) Fiennes even commits suicide as if he were some fanatical, ultra-disciplined 15th-century Japanese warrior. Again, this is not a full-fledged comedy, so I can't really buy into much of this...IB has many surprise twists. Its strongest point, apart from the acting of the lead male trio, is the unpredictability. Admittedly, plenty of the plot is guided by Guy-Ritchie-Esquire coincidences such as the main characters CONSTANTLY bumping into each other by accident, but because this is a semi-comedy this can be overlooked. The big finale would have been impossible without these chance encounters.A bit disturbing was McDonagh's non-latent anti-Americanism. Are the British still peeved off about losing that war over 200 years ago? Are they using the current wave of anti-U.S. sentiment to channel these age-old frustrations? McDonagh might be able to answer that. The midget character says at one point that he foresees a war between the whites and the blacks (as if he were listening to a Carnivore album), but I do have to wonder if we might not end up with a Unites States vs. Europe (& friends) war at some point. The way this pathetic, hysterical, and mostly envy-based anti-American propaganda is going at the moment - being very much pushed further and further into the extreme by the Leftist European media and movies such as this - there's a chance we might actually have that conflict a couple of decades from now. I guess we all know who'd come out the winner in that one...I had to vomit when Farrell described Clemense Poesy as 'beautiful' upon seeing her the first time. 'Are they trying to sell us yet another mediocre-looking nepotistic female offspring as a ravishing hottie?' I immediately thought. I checked her background, and yep, sure enough: her Daddy was a theater director. That's the sort of 'small thing' that opens doors, I reckon... (E-mail me if you want to see my rather large Hollywood Nepotism file.) Bruges offers some very nice scenery, IB has a fairly interesting story, and an effective soundtrack. The Continental cast wasn't that good.",Null,0,4,29 October 2008
Fight Club," Practically flawless - except for the casting of Billy Armstrong.
","One of the best movies of the 90s, no question about it. I am not going to philosophize about the movie's message/philosophy at length, I don't see the point in that. If you've seen it and you're intelligent you'll have understood it, whether you agree with its points or not. If you haven't seen it, there is little point in having an irrelevant little review explain/ruin things in advance.It's a movie whose fan-base is mostly male. Women may get some pleasure out of watching Pitt's oiled-up steroid(?)-pumped body, but there isn't much about the story that most of them will find appealing. It's a violent, complex, unique film - not exactly a TV soap opera. I'd advise a repeat viewing of 'Mr.Smith' as opposed to watching 'Fight Club'.There is not a second of boredom to be found in FC. At first I wasn't happy with the cast, but Norton and Pitt work splendidly together, if only to be marred somewhat by the quite talentless Helena Bonham Carter, whose resemblance to a certain Green Day member is hard to ignore. They might as well have cast Billy Armstrong in the role of Norton's (female) love-interest. The visual look of the movie is at the kind of very high level one expects from Fincher.So why did he make such bad movies afterward ('Panic Room', 'Zodiac'), after making the best one of his career?",Null,2,8,20 January 2008
As Good as It Gets," An overrated and mediocre mix of comedy and drama.
","If this is as good as it gets I'll quit watching films. Has a slow start but improves after the first half-hour or so. Nicholson is good - though definitely not brilliant - and Hunt is forgettable. The film as a whole is semi-entertaining. However, there aren't any belly-laugh moments. But the biggest problem are the drama to comedy (and vice versa) transitions which tend to ruin the comedic flow of the film. Although worth checking out, the film is overrated. It's one of those comedies which cause major hysteria among both critics and (probably) viewers, and for totally unfathomable reasons. Oscar Shmoscar; this is most definitely not one of Nicholson's best roles. To be more specific, I will name some films where he was better: 'One Flew', 'The Shining', 'Hoffa', 'The Last Detail', and 'Wolf'. As for Helen Hunt, her Oscar is one in a series of undeserved Oscars for actors who have nepotism to thank for their illustrious careers. How does that old saying go?...

Memento," This thought-provoking story is nothing for fans of Britney Spears.
","It's always nice to finally come across something original. In this case the unique elements (at least I THINK they're new/unique) is a plot moving in reverse time-wise, and the main character having a chronic short-term memory loss problem. No, the story going backwards has not being handled idiotically like in Philip K. Dick's dumb time-reversal novel (I forget the title); instead, there is a very clever build-up of a mystery plot that will keep you guessing what is real/true right up until the very last scenes. As far as Pierce's short-term memory, that is a fascinating mental problem and it's a wonder that it hasn't been utilized before in film (or has it?). There have been movies about amnesiacs in the past but that is quite different from this affliction.Writing and especially editing a movie like this must have been a major headache. And to do this in such a way that it isn't confusing for the viewer (unless your name is Paris Hilton or Drew Barrymore) verges on brilliant. The only objection I have is the direction; Nolan fails to create a visual look that would complement the great story. There are some clever ideas/shticks, but there is a lack of mood. Whether this was due to an insufficient budget, I don't know. Had 'Memento' been made with that Fincher or Coen brothers visual touch, it would have been practically flawless. The cast is good, no complaints there. Maybe Nolan could have shown the attractive-in-an-unusual-way Moss in a more exposing light in the bed scenes; it wouldn't have hurt...Toward the end it seemed as if nothing will add up satisfactorily; this would have been typical of a thriller. But, as in the brilliant 'Possible Worlds' (not a thriller, but a mystery), all the loose ends are tied up neatly so that I really don't see any glaring or even minor logic problems here. Maybe a doctor who is an expert on Lenny's affliction may find a few problems in that area, but otherwise the script is very tight, which is extremely RARE in (modern) thrillers. I guess this time around it's substance over style (unlike 'Saw', for example). It's just a pity that we didn't get substance AND a sufficiently flashy directorial style.",Null,2,5,16 September 2007
Alien: Resurrection," Not brilliant, but fun entry.
","I'm not sure I agree with even having a fourth party in the 'trilogy', or ex-trilogy. The third part had a glorious and finite ending. But when you combine the DNA from the dead Ripley and the DNA from the head of a Hollywood studio you get a monster that is for all practical purposes immortal. The film is visually up to the standard of the series, perhaps even better-looking than some of the others. Jeunet, as is evident in 'Amelie Poulain', knows his way with visuals so there is no problem there. There is also no problem cast-wise... almost.Who the hell had the 'brilliant' idea to cast Ryder in a sci-fi film, and in an 'Alien' film at that? First we are supposed to accept her as a SMUGGLER. I don't think so. (I mean, she proved that she can't even successfully smuggle stolen clothes in an L.A. clothes store!) Then we are supposed to accept her as some kind of a TERRORIST with a mission to destroy the aliens. I don't think so. And then we are supposed to buy that she is an ANDROID - on top of all that. Smuggler? A joke. Terrorist? A bigger joke. ANDROID??? UNBELIEVABLE! Her being an ANDROID is a piece of absurdity that was the hardest to swallow in recent movie memory. To make things worse, they made her WEEP in one scene over the fact that the others are making fun of her being a robot: this doesn't exactly help make her more believable as one, either. Ryder is cute, relatively likable and everything, but I simply don't see a place for her either in the future or in the past; I would only cast her in a late 20th century setting. Having Ryder in this picture is like putting Bruce Willis or Stallone in a generation X film (or a costume drama). Who's next in line to play in outer space? Madonna? Drew Barrymore? Richard Simmons? Roseanne? Hugh Grant? The rest of the casting is good; the inclusion of Perlman, Hedaya, and Wyncott, among others, was good. The film is full of action, the characters aren't annoying... almost.The evil scientist shtick was used here to a high and absurd level. There are also occasional lines and one-liners here and there that almost threaten to turn this film into a self-parody and I, for one, consider this a bad idea; either it's a full-scale parody with Bill Murray and Goldie Hawn or it's a regular sci-fi horror - make up your mind. An example of this indecisiveness is the scene in which a half-human half-alien is born in the presence of a cocooned scientist. His comments about the 'infant' being like a 'butterfly' (and other such nonsense) were ridiculous. A sequel that parodies itself cannot work, one example being 'Escape from L.A.' (though, admittedly, THAT particular movie would have been bad anyway).However, the film is fun to watch, and the underwater sequences were good. The humour didn't always work, but most of the dialog didn't get (too) moronic. The first half is better.

World War Z," This hilarity was based on a book? Perhaps a comic-book.
","It's the 21st century. Hollywood has devolved, regressed, dumbed-down: serial-killers have become superhuman in strength, knowledge, and cunning (a trend started with 'Copycat' and other such moronic 90s flicks); skinny effeminate nerds (Di Crapio, Gyllenhaal, Brody) impersonate tough guys; women with no breasts, ugly faces, 8 feet tall, and with wiry arms and legs are proclaimed as beauties in the corrupt media and cast as 'beauties'; zombies are no longer slow and dim-witted but fast, intelligent and occasionally even behave like outer-space termites who spontaneously build sky-high flesh-ladders that cover entire Israeli walls. (But only if some Arab girl grabs a mike and starts singing into it badly.) Yes, once upon a time Tinseltown serial-killers were mere humans. Not anymore; as mentally ill Hollywood executives pushed for new dumb shticks to attract the increasingly dumbed-down movie-goers with, they hired writers whom they started giving explicit instructions to exaggerate, ignore all logic, exaggerate, ignore all logic, and then some. Ditto zombie films; once slow and pathetic – even comical pushovers – zombies are now faster than Usain Bolt on his best Jamaican juice concoction. Their energy levels never dissipate thereby breaking the unbreakable Laws of Thermodynamics. They eat and drink nothing (unlike traditional zombies who are simply hungry) but attack only so they can infect humans. (Huh?) It's a sad state of affairs, this need to make everything more extreme, more exaggerated – hence unavoidably more stupid.I am sure some former East German dope-doctors are watching this movie from their jail-cells and secret labs, going all 'wow' and 'ooh' and 'aah' as they watch Brad Pitt get smothered by zombies so fast that they could easily outrun a cheetah or an antelope in their prime. They probably wish they had some of that juice right now for Usain Bolt, who is wondering what new drugs these modern sports-performance mengheles are working on for him, now that he is approaching his 30s hence not quite able to run the doped-up 9-second 100 meter sprint anymore.WWZ is beyond dumb. Let me explain why. It sets itself up not as a run-of-the-mill cheesy zombie flick that is hence beyond (much) criticism. No. It sets itself up as if it were based in some kind of a reality similar to ours, hence the movie is fair game when it comes to nit-picking for logic flaws. And nonsense there is aplenty. We have a 'virus' that COMPLETELY – physically and mentally – transforms its victim into what is essentially an alien being within mere seconds. Dumber still, this new creature is MUCH faster than the body's previous host (how? Why?); it's impervious to pain; it's in a perpetual state of frenzy (yet somehow strategically aware and with a cunning nature); even the good old-fashioned shot in the head isn't enough anymore to immediately kill it. I was half-expecting the bloody things to grow wings and fly at super-sonic speeds, or to grow fangs a meter long from whose tips poisonous snake venom would drip.But that's probably planned for the sequel. Coming to a cinema near you, soon: 'World War Z II: Zombies Grow Wings & Fly Like Military Jets While Spewing Fire Out Of Their Mouths Very Godzilla-Like'. Don't be so sure that I'm exaggerating. What was once considered too absurd to be even in a horror movie is nowadays part-and-parcel of nearly every action or thriller flick.Basically, the set-up is a rather straight-forward zero-chance-for-humanity affair, i.e. the ENTIRE world is royally screwed and nearly everyone should be infected within a few days. And yet, we have all these inexplicable survivors, people who managed to escape from ant-like hordes of super-power zombies. How is that possible? The simple answer: any nonsense is possible in a 21st-century Tinseltown big-budget turkey. Literally anything. Imagine facing an enemy consisting of thousands of invincible raving lunatics charging at you all at once, never tiring, and never resting. Chances? Nil. And yet, somehow, Brad Pitt not only escapes them over and over, he even survives a plane crash.Yes, that plane-crash outcome was beyond cretinous. How are the writers of this unintentional comedy able to look themselves in their gold-plated Beverly Hills mirrors? 'Yes, I wrote a scene in which the only two survivors of a plane crash are the two main characters – the only relevant characters in that entire airplane. Are movie-goers dumb enough for such a plot-twist? Sure they are.' And they are right. 90% of today's movie-goers are brainwashed, awe-struck morons; sheep ready to watch and enjoy any movie, no matter how dumb. Hollywood suits wouldn't finance these kinds of silly turds if there weren't millions of zombies waiting in line to watch these zombie films, ready to digest the plots without throwing up laughing. When you have no more brain-cells to lose, you become a willing zombie slave to the powerful media-hype giant that is Hollywood.I did snicker a bit when I found out that Pitt plays some kind of a UN hotshot. Ironically, his anorexic wife and fellow kid-collector Angelina Jolie is associated with that fine, useless organization in real life. Angelina working for the UN is admittedly a lot more preposterous than Pitt working for them, which goes to show that sometimes truth is dumber than fiction – even Hollywood fiction.The highlight is Pitt's 'solution': infect people with major diseases so that the zombies will avoid tearing them into bits. Wow. Monty Python could not have thought up a dumber punchline.More poor writing reared its stupid head when Pitt finds himself in the Welsh medical research center, creating forced 'cinematic tension' by being illogical and not telling the personnel straight away who he is. That's 5 minutes of the movie they could saved themselves – and the viewers.That whole shtick with zombies reacting only to noise was pretty daft, as well.",Null,1,3,11 December 2014
12 Monkeys," Solid but hardly terrific.
","This futuristic mystery/thriller has a relatively solid first hour, then slips a little once it becomes just a thriller. That the ending wasn't going to be 'happy' was to be expected from Gilliam - hint: 'Brazil'. But while 'Brazil''s ending is emotionally powerful, this one is without a real high point, plus the film ends with the too-oft-heard Louis Armstrong tune.As far as the logic is concerned in this complex film: the puzzle bits and pieces fit well, apart from a few huge coincidences. There is 'only' one, big, logic problem: Willis indirectly caused the virus to spread by going back to the past to investigate it! As it turns out towards the end, Pitt didn't bring about the virus, BUT he indirectly helped by distracting the investigation of Stowe and Willis. Secondly, Stowe - having written books and given seminars on the end of the world - influenced the madman working in the laboratory to destroy the planet. Or did she? To what extent? This is open to argument.There are other unanswered questions; was it a coincidence that young Willis was present at his own death as a grown-up at the airport, or did the scientists who sent Willis know about this little fact and send him for that reason (among other things)? At the end we find out that one of Willis's mates from the future got a new order - to kill Stowe, as she was indirectly responsible for the madman's success. But wasn't it too late at that point to correct the mistake by deciding to kill Stowe on the airport? By that time Stowe's murder wouldn't have changed anything. And didn't Willis anyway say in the first half of the movie that he didn't come back to stop the spread but to get a sample of the original virus-carrying monkeys? If he said that it was not possible to change the disaster then why did his bosses from the future order for Stowe's murder, thereby implying that they tried to change the past, i.e. the spread of the virus? Could it be that they lied to Willis, or did they just change their minds? In either case, why? Still, all in all, the logic could have been worse. Gilliam isn't as clever as he thinks he is  at least not clever enough to do a time-travel movie that makes complete sense.Stowe and Willis do a decent job, but Pitt overacts in his role too much, for my taste. Just because you play a madman shouldn't mean that you should be waving about manically and uncontrollably all the time. Visually, I expected a bit more from Gilliam. Only some scenes from the future are visually good.",Null,3,9,22 January 2007
Shaun of the Dead," This is supposed to be hilarious.
","This is such a forgettable little film that I forgot I ever even saw it until I read the movie's title on IMDb's 'top 250'. So why is this watchable but unfunny comedy/horror movie there? There are several explanations for this strange occurrence.1) The usual explanation: that most movie-goers have zero taste. 2) A bunch of Brits gave it high marks for patriotic reasons. 3) There was a computer or human error in averaging the votes/ratings.The gags are cheap/obvious/predictable, the movie's comedy consisting mainly of a bunch of average actors clowning around. If this movie is supposed to represent the 'British revival', I don't want to know what would represent its downfall. A far cry from Pegg's later comedies.",Null,10,25,10 September 2007
The English Patient," Women, get your handkerchiefs out!
","A flawed masterpiece wanna-be. David Lean is the past, long live Minghella. Or something like that. Or not. The movie's strong point is that it remains interesting in spite of its length, even though there are some moments of tedium around the middle. The fact that the movie isn't too dull makes up for its weaknesses.The movie's weakest point is the casting of the doomed lovers. Scott Thomas and Fiennes have no chemistry going. He is as cold and distant as ever; he can't help it - that aloof English exterior is his trademark, whether he likes it or not. But the bigger problem is Thomas. She is far too unattractive to play the part, and when she takes her clothes off we are shocked to see that her body is in even worse shape than her face. She is a mess. A movie of such ambition and scope HAS to have a stunningly beautiful, charismatic leading lady, and a passionate, charismatic leading man. Just picture this movie with Gable and de Havilland. Or, since it's a 90s movie and the choice for such a film is slim, how about McGregor and Collette. Or Pitt andÂ… Oh, hell, almost ANY actress is better-looking than Thomas! I'll never understand why Minghella chose to show Thomas entirely nude, while we get only brief glimpses of the far better-looking (which isn't saying much), better built Binoche. The worst thing about it all is that Thomas is sold to the viewer as some kind of beauty. Well, you have to be gay, mad or blind to buy into that.The story is well-constructed, but contains an incredibly stupid plot-device: the allies arresting Fiennes - who has a British accent - just because his name is unusual is very dumb and unconvincing, indeed. It wouldn't matter so much were it not crucial to the tragic outcome. Minghella had to think of a way why Fiennes would betray his country in order to save his girl, but he couldn't think of anything good so he came up with this nonsense. I also think that he overdid it with the predictable tragedies; it is okay to have one suicide in a movie, but two?? One guy kills himself after finding out about Fiennes's betrayal. The other guy, Firth, dives like a kamikaze pilot into Fiennes. It's all just a bit much. The same can be said of the surprising vertical-sex scene; I am used to Michael Douglas screwing his female co-stars on the wall or furniture, but to have non-horizontal sex of this kind in a wanna-be Lean movie is too much.I don't understand why Thomas attacks Fiennes when she appears in his suite just before they bonk for the first(?) time. And I was not at all impressed by that scene where the Indian entertains Binoche with some rope-fresco-spotting nonsense: that kind of pretentious stuff is right out of one of those dull 'arty' European movies.",Null,8,18,20 January 2007
Hostel," Slowakians must love this sadistic thriller.
","It's hard for me to give this movie a rating. I am torn between 9 stars and 2 stars. This is possibly the most depraved, nightmarish, most sickening horror film I've ever seen. Except that even I'm not sure whether that makes it an excellent film or a piece of s*** that would've been better left unmade. However, I shouldn't have been too surprised by such unhinged sadism; after 'Saw' had such success, I should've known that irresponsible sadism would hit its stride in horror. (Not that there wasn't any before) But while 'Saw' is supremely idiotic and utterly logic-free, 'Hostel' is not as far-fetched (though that isn't saying much, actually, 'Saw' being so INCREDIBLY dumb). There is no question that a criminal (soft word here) operation such as pay-to-torture is not only realistic, but could even already exist in some form. To criticize the movie on the basis of its basic premise I'll leave to the reality-challenged. What IS far-fetched to the point of ludicrousness is that such a crime net would involve such a large number of people, practically an entire town, and perhaps even the whole state of Slovakia  in this case; I'm not sure if that was implied or not. Ah, yes The Slovakians must be thrilled about this movie. Needless to say, it's probably banned there, and Elli Roth, the writer-director, is probably at the top of everyone's s***list. And here's the other point about the premise: it would've been far more realistic if set in some African or especially South American country. While a solid choice if the choices were limited to Europe, Slovakia is hardly an ideal choice in general. As for Europe: Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia All those would have done. However, Paraguay or Bolivia, or some such semi-developed country would've been more realistic (though I admit a little less effective). Since the movie is out for realism and not fantasy, I think the main character's escape is ludicrous. Sure, the movie would've been even tougher to watch if there hadn't been a good dose of revenge at the end, but the escape was too easy  relatively speaking. The sadism is self-indulgent and clearly stemming from a sick mind. Elli Roth can talk all he wants about wanting to make a truly frightening film (which he succeeded in, no argument there) and that he researched for it, bla-bla-bla, but the bottom line is that Roth is a mental patient, just as those cretins who did 'Saw' are. Kids will watch this, and they shouldn't. Hell, even I shouldn't be watching such sickening depravity! There is no real point to the movie, except on the dumbest level i.e. 'don't go backpacking to remote places or make friends with strangers or have sex with Russian girls whose breasts are too good to be true'. The film is a sheer exercise in the most degenerate kind of enjoyment in physical torture, and should be liked only by psychopaths, sociopaths and other 'paths'. I am anything but a proponent of the 'Golden Age' of film. i.e. the naïve 30s and 40s (with their mostly dull and silly movies), but it is interesting to compare 'Dracula' from the 30s with something like this. How far has it all gone? Or: how low has the world sunk? Never mind that the movie is fascinating and unforgettable: so are train-wrecks, but that doesn't mean we should have them and enjoy them. Trust Tarantino, that prototype of a 90s geek, to give this thing his blessing. The fact that someone as retarded as him spearheads modern US cinema is truly sad. Leading directors of the past were hardly intellectuals, but next to Quentin they were gods. This little nerd, who so perversely and gleefully enjoys sadism and torture, would scream like not one but 38 little girls if a psychopath so much as said 'hello' to him. People like him need a reality check. To treat torture as a form of mindless entertainment is a sign of high retardation and having the moral sense of a lizard. That is why I've always called him an 'idiot savant', a moron genius. Talented, but utterly hollow, no substance there. Visually, the movie is highly effective. Roth is clearly very talented. The chamber scenes are unbelievably somber, and compliments for not directing them in the MTV style which would have made it all less effective because less realistic. The atmosphere Roth creates in the dungeons is uniquely brilliant. A drawback, which I nearly forgot considering the other aspects, is that the movie takes a half-hour to get started, which I hate in horror films. (I believe in the 'Evil Dead' school of horror-film-making where no minute is wasted.)",Null,1,4,2 January 2007
Us," Another mega-stinker from an award-winning 'film-maker'... who doesn't even have a grasp of the basics.
","Starts off promisingly, with a decent enough premise for a mindless horror flick, but after the fairly 'normal' first half-hour this cinematic roasted turkey just kept disintegrating, deflating, dumbing down, stupidifying, cretenizing.In short, a typical airhead thriller - about violent kumbaya zombies holding Hands Across America. No joke. But considering the man who wrote/directed this dross, nothing should surprise us.Yes, us. The victims of this monumentally idiotic movie. Us. The movie is - very mockingly - dedicated to its victimized viewers. It's about us and our patience. And our stupidity for wasting two hours on horsemanure.I had no clue this was made by the rank amateur slash infamous ray-cist who created 'Get Out', that awful white-guilt-financed/fueled Hollywood-darling (nuclear) bomb, otherwise I would have stayed away, very far, from this garbage. In fact, considering the damaged entity which made it, this is a refreshing improvement! Johnny is now officially a 1/10-level director, no longer a mere 0/10. At this rate, he should make a mediocre movie in about a decade. Fingers crossed.Despite its supernatural theme, this starts playing out like a stereotypical idiotic home invasion flick as soon as the evil doubles move into action. Things get decidedly dumb from there, and I mean dumb. Nothing here makes sense. And then, just as you think it can't get any worse, it turns into a comedy. Out of the blue. Not even a funny comedy, but a cheap sit-com.And then, eventually, the movie abandons comedy and goes back to 'seriovs bvsiness' by giving us a moonwalking clone... which is technically speaking still comedy, but comedy of the unintentional variety.Many whys here, extremely few becauses.1. Why is Adelaide meeting her evil twin connected to other evil twins showing up in other households? Shouldn't this horror be reserved just for her? How the hell does her meeting a twin trigger a pandemic of evil twins? Is Adelaide the Spartacus of underground bunker clones? Why do evil twins wait for decades to finally start a 'revolution'? Are they so thick it took them that long to realize that they could leave their tunnels by simply moving upwards?2. Why do the white-family evil twins immediately kill their originals, whereas Adelaide's parallel family takes things very slowly? If anything, shouldn't it be the opposite: doesn't the real-Adelaide-turned-zombie have EXTRA motive to take revenge on her evil nemesis by being quick and brutal? (Instead, she is used as cheesy B-movie-level exposition...)3. Why does the white woman's twin not kill Adelaide? She ties her to a bed instead. Did the director tell her not to kill her because that would prevent that amazingly dumb switcheroo end-twist?4. Why must we be tortured with rap music? Isn't the idiotic plot torturous enough?5. Where did the government get the funding to build tunnels for millions of useless clones? It's Jimmy Carter, isn't it?6. Are evil twins born out of our poops? The movie said they were coming out of sewers.7. Why is the average rating for this movie so ridiculously high when negative reviews rule the 'helpfulness' review option listing?8. Why did this site allow fake reviews and concentrated hype to render averages of new movies almost entirely meaningless?9. Why does the movie start off as a moody mystery but then degenerate into self-parody? 'Don't tell me you just made a Home Alone reference...' - the line that completely sealed the movie's fate.10. Why does the CNN cameraman just stand there while a maniac with a knife approaches to stab him?11. Why does Adelaide's evil twin (who's actually the real Adelaide) say 'we're Americans'? What kind of idiotic answer is that? Is the film-maker trying to make some vapid 'grand' social/political statement through this ridiculous zombie film - as he so spectacularly failed at in his previous awful movie?12. Why are all evil twins born with the skills of highly-skilled ninjas? Were they bred to control their originals - or to beat the crap out of them?13. Why does Adelaide's evil twin talk and reason like a class-conscious loser jealous of people who have more? 'While you got all the soft toys, I got sharp ones that hurt me.' Are the parallel demons Commies then? Why are tunnel toys sharp?14. Why does this horror thriller run almost 120 minutes?15. Why don't some film-makers know the basics of film-making - which includes the knowledge that horror films should never be two hours long? (Unless you're Kubrick.)16. How is it possible that a family undergoing an extremely traumatic experience can start making jokes as if they're suddenly in a sitcom? 'Hey, I killed two, also!'17. How is it possible that people who finish film school actually think they can casually genre-hop within one movie?18. Why is it that Adelaide's son's twin imitates his movements in that bloody silly car-explosion scene? So are the demons slaves to the originals or not! Or is the director telling us that the evil kid is so thick he doesn't realize there's a fire behind him?19. Why do IMDb bots have nothing better to do than help hype bad movies by posting fake reviews and swarm-voting?20. Why do thick film-makers believe and hope they can get away with an explanation as dumb as the 'government created 100 million underground clones with which to control the humans above' malarkey?21. Why would 'the government' waste trillions of dollars on such an ultra-expensive and idiotic scheme - when they can much more easily and cheaply control the rabble through CNN's fake news and liberal-propaganda brainwashing at schools and America's Mickey Mouse universities?22. Why did the dilettante director pick a word as moronic as 'tethered'? Did he Google it a week before shooting started? Should Google delete this bloody stupid word from its computers so that bad directors can't find out about it hence annoy us with it in future clone flicks?23. If the clones' purpose was only control of the originals, then why did they turn into kumbaya buffoons who are into Hands Across America nonsense?24. If the real Adelaide came specifically for revenge (for the involuntary childhood switcheroo), then why didn't she say so at any point? She certainly wasted a lot of time on exposition, but failed to mention by far the most important thing...25. If the real Adelaide was the killer all along, then how come the impostor Adelaide didn't have superior ninja skills compared to the real Adelaide who seemed as well versed in ninja-ing as the other clones? Why didn't fake Adelaide have any ninja skills? Is it because Ninja Courses start only after the age of 10 in the tunnels?26. The millions of clones were 'abandoned', and yet they survived: how? Did they go to evil-twin copies of Wal-Mart to shop? Did they butcher bunnies?27. Why did the real Adelaide lose her voice in the bunkers? Was she singing Slayer songs a lot?28. How come this ray-cist director didn't make a movie as bad as 'Get Out'? Why aren't white people the bad guys again?29. Since when was 70s technology even remotely close to being able to clone chickens, let alone humans? What kind of a moron sets up a secret government cloning program that is based in the 70s, or maybe even earlier? (It is never hinted when the cloning started...)30. What kind of deluded, confused writer-director sets up a finale battle in which the protagonist fights a DANCING, moonwalking antagonist? Why didn't he just add a laugh-track?31. Why didn't the real Adelaide simply SAY that she was replaced, explaining that this is what fuels her revenge? I mean, aside from the fact that it would spoil the idiotic plot-twist that comes 90 minutes later...32. Why does the imposter Adelaide behave as if she were the real Adelaide?Actually, I know the answer to this one: she is a walking talking plot-device, not a real person. Neither Adelaide is real. No character in this movie is real: not the clones, nor the originals. They are all asinine jokes created in an extremely shoddy child-like screenplay written by a hugely untalented, lazy hack.Let's summarize... The government was incapable of using the clones as telepaths - yet they created an army of super-strong ninja warriors... then let them rot underground instead of use them for fighting wars...? (Doesn't Unhollywood keep telling us that the 'evil military' is always seeking for new weapons? Here's one, yet it's left abandoned! With these ninja warriors the US would have even won the war in Afghanistan.)If this director had any sense he'd have set this plot in the future - not the past - and he would have devised a military conspiracy involving using clones for wars, instead of to control America's obedient sheep. The left-wing media already does that successfully enough, without the help of clones!This is doubtlessly one of the dumbest movies in recent years. Its utter disregard for logic and common sense, and its schizophrenic genre-hopping, make it unique. If Ed Wood had been cloned 50 years ago (or much more likely 50 years from now) by the military, and experimented on with LSD in secret underground government bunkers, then given a camera - he would have made a movie like this.",Null,8,13,1 December 2019
Coffee and Cigarettes," If a bird's-eye-view of coffee is your cup of tea, have fun with this film.
","I have no idea why Jarmusch would take this kind of premise and make it this pointless and dull. But let's look at the movie, segment by segment: Segment 1: Benigni and Wright seem to be too embarrassed to speak openly, to go beyond the casual small-talk which is DULL. Hence, this segment is dull.Segment 2: The black twins get harassed by Buscemi who starts talking about Elvis. Forgettable.Segment 3: Iggy Pop and Waits do the same shtick as Benigni and Wright: another celebrity pairing where the dialogue can't go beyond small-talk (because both are embarrassed - for some reason). When it does, to a small extent, Waits get somewhat insulted and Pop gives up and leaves. Average stuff, but better than the previous 2 and the following 3 segments, i.e. the only half-decent 'story' in the first half of the movie.Segment 4: Two mob guys do a scene right out of 'The Sopranos' or a Scorsese film. Neither here nor there. Average.Now the movie really starts to suck: Segment 5: A woman stares at a gun magazine, while a waiter tries to befriend her. Maybe 6-7 lines of dialogue. A totally plot less, pointless and dull segment. Any moron could have 'written' this kind of crap. I think Bergman, that overrated charlatan, has done quite enough in the silent-scenes drama sub-genre. Do we need any more silence in movies? No. We need IDEAS. This segment is not based on one.Segment 6: The two French black guys. The whole encounter is about 'why? do you have something to tell me?' and this 'theme' goes on and on. Utter nonsense. I could barely concentrate on what they were saying. Yawn Segment 7: Kate Blanchett plays dual roles, twins. Again, a barrier between two parties cannot be broken, only subtle hints of animosity that is being carefully hidden from the other person. But so what? This sort of situation might be interesting as a mini-play to a stoned audience of 12 in some seedy NY art-club, but for a movie this isn't good enough, sorry. And if anyone out there still gets excited over someone doing multiple roles in a movie  wow!!!!  then have a ball with this mediocrity.But just as I was about to doze off, the movie got better: Segment 8: Funnily enough, Jack and Meg from that awful 'band', The White Stripes, end up being more interesting than professional actors and personalities such as Iggy Pop or Tom Waits. Meg can't act to save her life, but Jack is solid, and the segment is interesting in a strange sort of way.Segment 9: Hands down the best segment. Molina and Coogan are excellent as yet another celebrity pairing that is trying to break the wall of perpetual small-talk between them. Being a fan of Coogan's humour, it is obvious to me that he had a hand in improvising/writing the dialogue, and that is why this segment has a point. It has a beginning, middle, and end, and it's quite amusing. Very subtle, but clever. Very English. I think it's the longest segment  probably because Coogan actually has the talent and had made the effort to make something out of it, whereas the other actors and celebs in this movie weren't up to the task to the most part.Segment 10: Bill Murray and the members of the brain-dead Wu-Tang Clan (or 'Klan', with a 'k'? Actually, who gives a s***?) engage in some more of this movie's trademark pointless dialogue, but at least neither side is shy so they talk relatively openly. (A shy Rza would have been TOO much to bear.) Mildly interesting and average.Segment 11: Two old geezers talk during a break at work. OK.All in all, only one segment is excellent, and another 3-4 solid. The rest are dull or forgettable. Is Jarmusch getting fat and lazy? Or is his stupidity finally coming to the forefront? 'I think next up will be a movie where everyone sips coffee and puffs away. I'll just get a bunch of my friends to improvise some dialogue. I mean, they're all celebs so they should be smart enough to come up with stuff. The stories need not be connected. In fact, they don't even need to be interesting. You see, I've finally realized that it's best to bore people. That way they think that there is some DEEP message hidden in the movie somewhere. That should shut up both the critics and the fans. No-one will dare say they didn't like the movie, for fear of being accused of being too dull-witted to fully appreciate it.' Or perhaps I give him too much credit for 'slyness'; he IS a moron, after all.Jarmusch isn't the interesting director he once was. Or perhaps it's the fact that I don't do either: drink coffee or smoke cigarettes, so I can't appreciate the full depth of this smoky, caffeine-induced movie.Jarmusch's recent 'Broken Flowers' isn't much better. 'Ghost Dog' was also average, apart from the good ending. 'C&C' has good photography and an interesting cast, but that's just not enough. A self-indulging mediocrity similar to 'Blue In The Face', which was shot in 4 days or something. (That may work in punk music, but in films)",Null,4,10,20 February 2007

I love the cool classical movie score here!! It reminds me of The Beatles and of Schopenhauer's music!!!! I read the Philosophy Writings of one called Paris Hilton! She rocks! She's so cool!!! My favourite scene was when Tobey said something or other to that guy in the scene that came after the one I just mentioned!! I hope they make 20 more sequels!! I hope they release me soon so I can write 'Tobey, I love youuu' on a banner 100 times and stick it in front of his villa! Tobey, you were so smart to make friends with Leo Di Crapio when you were both kids!! So smart to fall in love with a rich daughter!! Sam Raimi, please cast Drew Barrymore to play the evil Dr.Einstein in 'Spiderman 14: More Dull CGI & Crap Casting'!!! Does anyone know where Tobey lives??? I gotta know!!

Superbad," Let's hope casting directors take note of this Emma... We've all had enough of Jennifer Aniston-like uglies.
","'Superbad' works very well primarily due to its realistic, not overly simplified main characters (talking about the adolescents here), and in particular as a result of the spot-on casting. The photography and the script are very good, too. This comedy succeeds in the washed-up teen genre because it has great acting, mostly convincing, colourful dialogue, and for the most part avoids the kind of overly goofy, animated buffoonery that is the hallmark of teen-movie rubbish such as 'Animal House' and 'American Pie'.The only criticism I have is that the film falls apart a bit in the last half-hour, which seems to be a disease that befalls just about every (U.S.) comedy: the 'I love you' dialogue between the two male leads was embarrassing, unfunny and unrealistic. The other (minor) problem is the cop pair: they're funny early on, but by the time the two hit Seth with their car, they'd already become too exaggerated, too lacking in credibility in a movie that doesn't require that kind of nonsense to get laughs. The laid-back, unforced dialogue works better than some of the more visual gags.The stand-outs are the fat kid, McLovin, and Emma Stone who plays Jules. Emma is drop-dead gorgeous and utterly charming, making her flirtation(?) with Seth all that much more absurd hence interesting.",Null,1,3,5 October 2008
Hot Fuzz," The 'plot virus' strikes again – in yet another comedy with great potential.
","HF could have been one of the Top Ten comedies of all time, if only it had continued the style and pace of the first 40 minutes or so. Unfortunately, its writers fell into a standard trap that has ruined or at least lessened countless comedies. I refer, of course, to comedies with potential, not garbage that didn't have potential to begin with: all those Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer duds.Movies such as HF remind me why I'm a proponent of the ZAZ, Monty Python, Jerry Seinfeld and Sascha Baron Cohen schools of comedy, i.e. types of writing in which gags are always the priority with no room for sentimentality or preaching (neither of which are a major problem in HZ, BTW), and where the plot is only secondary, or preferably even in 100th place. People watch comedies to have a laugh; only morons watch them for the action scenes or to follow a story closely.HF starts off wonderfully, with its impeccable first half-hour brimming with laughs and perfect comedic timing. Meanwhile, a grain of doubt started creeping up: 'this can't go on for the duration; I bet the movie dissolves in a needless crime plot and then finishes off with standard, mindless, unfunny action scenes'. Unfortunately, I was mostly right. Just as I'd feared, in this so-called 'crime comedy' the plot eventually wins over the gags. During the first half-hour, HF is 99% comedy, but by the half-way mark, it's 90% crime/action, 10% (good) gags. In other words, the crime takes over the laughs and we're left with just another episode of 'Midsummer Murders' instead of a constantly funny movie that's supposed to provide a continual barrage of gags. Most Hollywood comedies have a very weak last quarter, or even half, simply because the formulaic/commercial school of comedy demands that the plot has a beginning, a development, and a conclusion - meaning that there is no place for humour (or very little space for it) once the plot comes near or exactly at its point of conclusion. Indeed, the second half of the movie is a mystery flick, which then predictably switches gears to even more pointless action scenes, which are predictably not funny.Show me an extended action segment that's funny – in any comedy ever made - and I will show you Sean Penn writing an essay without 280 spelling mistakes and over 100 grammatical errors. The shoot-out in the shopping center wasn't funny; it was merely formulaic kiddie stuff. Slightly original, I'll give them that, but ultimately pathetic compared to what the movie promised in its first half-hour, with its clever dialogue and fun parody. The outdoor chases and shootouts are no better; this was a cop-out: it is far easier to the predictable - unfunny – easy-to-write thing than to actually roll up your sleeves and make a true effort to conclude the film with a bunch of laughs rather than fairly corny sight-gags.A far better idea would have been to outright spoof the entire cop genre – sort of in the 'Naked Gun' vein – i.e. WITHOUT succumbing to the 'plot trap' that so many comedy writers fall into. Simon Pegg is a very good comedian and even better writer, but he will become a movie great only if he learns that comedies need to consist of 100% pure, unadulterated, undistilled, unschmaltzified humour and that a comedy needs to be a non-interrupted barrage of gags devoid of 'serious' moments not to mention sentimentality, even if only very brief. Only this kind of approach works, usually. HF does have a brief moment or two when it gets slightly soppy or whatever. Sorry, Pegg, but you can't set us up with cartoon characters and then expect us to take them seriously in a dramatic way, as well. You just can't have your cake and eat it too.Besides, nearly every (commercial) comedy overstays its welcome after 90 minutes. 2 hours is simply too long. They could have made a tight 90-minute collection of great sight gags and one-liners, but instead they had to 'pepper' it up i.e. dilute it with unnecessary plot crap. I laughed my ass off during the first quarter, but after that I watched the movie with a mostly straight face – and my face is the ultimate judge of how good a comedy is; I trust it implicitly.You know how you deal with the 'comedy-movie plot trap'? You're writing a comedy and want to focus on the gags rather than have to worry how you'll wrap up the movie? Well, you do what the Pythons did in 'Holy Grail' and 'Life of Brian': you suddenly end the movie with a totally absurd scene. THAT'S the way to go; you get to keep the laughs at a steady pace right up until the end, while still providing a good ending. Unfortunately, not many comedians understand this, or think far too conventionally (when it comes to structure, at least) to be able to make such adventurous leaps of imagination in their writing.HF excels in its casting. These days it is rare to come across a comedy that has such a strong cast, and so many familiar and competent faces rather than a bunch of half-wit, in-bred nepotists.",Null,0,1,11 December 2014
Constantine," How terrifying can these demons be if Roger Federer's boyfriend Gavin Rossdale is one of them?
","You wanna hear a good joke? Rachel Weisz – police detective. Hilarious, huh? I've got another one: Tilda Swinton – as angel Gabriel. Want more? This one's even funnier: Tilda Swinton as angel Gabriel telling Keanu 'you're f**cked'. I half-expected a 'yo, bro' to be thrown in there as well.But here's the best joke of them all: Shia LeBoef – horror-movie superhero-sidekick comic-relief actor. If you're immune to annoying actors, you might be forgiven for thinking that his name was the joke here – although, in all fairness, his name IS damn funny. I'm not out of bad jokes yet, and neither is this horribly cast movie. How about this one: Gavin Rossdale in a horror film – as a semi-demon, sort of a Hell-beast Halfling. I mean, we already know he is half-man half-mouse, but telling us he's half-demon as well is definitely stretching our patience and imagination – not to mention the basics of mathematics since both halves are already taken. Roger Federer's Numero Uno fan and secret gay lover. Bromance shromance: their love is real. Federer's marriage is a Travolta-like sham and both sets of his twins are test-tube babies. But I digress. This is a review of a Keanu flick.Honestly, the way this movie's abysmal casting was unfolding, I was half-expecting Al Sharpton to appear as Satan. Although, admittedly that would at least make some sense. Clearly, the casting director is high on crack, pretty much all of the time. I hope he got his act together after all these years, so perhaps he isn't preparing to cast Matt Damon as the Dalai Lama, or Jennifer Aniston as a sexy woman.Also cocaine-happy is the script-writer. He makes Rachel a god-fearing Catholic who is adamant about having a Catholic funeral for her sister, even stooping so low as to actually degrade herself by begging a boy-fondling Catholic priest to grant her sister a proper religious burial so she doesn't end up in hell – yet that same day she tells Keanu that she doesn't believe in the Devil. Say what? Sure, most of us know that Catholics are very confused creatures, but even they ought to be able to follow the simplest rules of the religion they abide to. To summarize: Weisz believes in Hell – fears her sister will end up there – yet doesn't believe in the Devil. Who the hell does she think runs Hell then? Mahatma Gandhi? Che Guevara? Adolf Hitler? Joe Stalin? Evita Peron? (Admittedly, all those could run it, and run it well.)Keanu acts pretty weird too; after coming back from a brief visit to Hell – which is supposed to be burning hot, last time I checked a raving and ranting sermon - he asks Rachel for some food, not water. So the Catholic Oven evokes hunger? What the hell is wrong with this writer? Still, at least the writer has a sense of humour; he informs us that in order to visit Hell, all you need is one bathtub, 50 gallons of water, and one Keanu Reeves to drown you in it. That's a hoot.The movie does redeem itself somewhat by the surprising appearance of Peter Stormare as the Horned One (or at least the Bald One, in this case), and he doesn't disappoint. However, nothing and nobody could have truly remedied the anguish of having to watch androgynous Tilda Swinton impersonate an angel – or just having to see Tilda Swinton, period. Her/his/its 'performance' is the worst I've ever seen of any actor trying to do an angel – Gabrielish or otherwise – in the history of horror or comedy. This blue-blooded in-bred pink-orange mutant from a age-old inferior lineage of Scottish nobility (a result no doubt of centuries of Swintonian uncles molesting their Swintonian nieces), with her curly ginger locks and thick manly goalkeeper hands, lends the movie an air of absurdity and lack of seriousness that it doesn't deserve – even as a flick based on a stupid comic-book. After all, the script isn't essentially bad, and the action scenes and visual effects are fine. The less said about Federer's love interest, the better. Except that he's one of the worst post-grunge Cobain imitators on record, during his brief but profitable corporate-sponsored heyday(s) as the frontman of Bush – ironically named so considering that he swings the other way. Which way? Switzerland, as I'd already mentioned.",Null,0,4,13 December 2014
The Day After Tomorrow," Is this the prequel to Fox's 'Ice Age'? It's certainly a better comedy.
","'Godzilla' was marginally less dumb than the incredibly dumb 'Independence Day'. 'The Day After Tomorrow' is marginally less stupid than 'Godzilla'. At this rate of improvement we should expect a terrific and intelligent movie from Roland Emmerich... somewhere around the year 2368. Alas, by then we'll have a real Ice Age (one that doesn't distinguish between the rich and the poor) hence nowhere to watch his great films...TDAT is exactly what I expected it to be: not dull, good special effects, grand visual moments, cliché characters, filler scenes, sappy moments galore, a dumb premise, scientific gobbledygook, cretinous plot-devices, and political correctness of the most pathetic kind.It's the year 2004. Emmerich is writing a script for Hollywood. It's an election year. Emmerich is upset. Hollywood is upset. 'We can't allow Bush to win again! Hopefully Michael Moore's latest fantasy propaganda film will sway enough voters to vote Socialist!' Emmerich wants to live in a 'better' world i.e. one in which he can still make 100-million dollar movies through corporation money - and still live in San Trope villas - while fighting those oh-so evil corporations and their damn damn Capitalism. 'I know what I'll do... I, the greatest Germanic Roland of all time, will redefine the term 'poetic justice'. I will make those evil Americans look so foolish as they run away from an ice storm into Mexico. I am so smart! I will make those right-wing doubters show what their wicked Capitalism can do to nature and their precious America... And maybe I'll be rewarded by an Oscar or two for my blatant PC-ness...' Roland Emmerich isn't the brightest cookie in the world. Nothing new there. Most Hollywood people have s*** for brains. One of Roland's silliest jabs at the much-hated Republicans is his dumb Vice-Presidential character, an obvious and subtle-as-a-f*rt allusion to Dick Chenney. Those scenes with Chenney making a fool out of himself in an international conference and then later again talking to Quaid are so utterly absurd that they just keep reminding you that you're watching an Emmerich movie, which means that anything silly can happen at any given moment. Of course, what Em doesn't know is that the REAL Chenney's I.Q. is actually larger than that of Ron and all the cast involved in this movie combined.Evil, evil Capitalism and industry will bring an Ice Age! If only we drove those solar-energy-fueled cars that Robert Redford promoted, and if only we didn't use so much hair-spray!Oh, those whining liberals with their 'superior' theories on various political, social, and environmental issues... Poor misguides souls. So much emotion, so little rationale.(Will this review get deleted, too? Does this site punish those who don't think Left? We'll see...) Is ice politically correct? Is it Marxist? Does it work for Al-Qaida? I ask this because it seems that Ron's ice selects its victim-nations according to how much money they have. 'Zambia?... No, I won't freeze Zambia. They are poor. It wouldn't be right. Must freeze evil America.' Of course, Ron's Germany isn't evil. They're the good guys - as they've always been. Germany's frozen, too, but we don't get to see any of it...Fortunately for Em, like most viewers of this movie I am not a meteorologist so I can't identify all the nonsense Em has managed to pile up here. But something tells me that at least half of the science here is malarkey. Gay cowboy Gyllenhaal and other characters here are outrunning tsunamis, encroaching ice even (that scene was DUMB!), hell - they're even outrunning wolves at one point! You name it - it's been outrun by someone or other in TDAT.Speaking of wolves, why are Ron's wolves CGI wolves? Does it perhaps have something to do with the fact that even wolves are transformed into fantasy-land beasts of the apocalypse in Emmerich's movies, hence real wolves just wouldn't be good enough because they'd come off as a bunch of extra-furry dogs - which is all they really are. And what are they doing in Manhattan? So basically Em wants us to believe that in spite of there being millions of corpses to chew on, on the periphery of New York, the wolves had to go look for food ALL THE WAY in the center of NY?? The wolves appearing on that ship was the unintentionally funniest baloney Em came up with. It was very very funny.To be fair, not all of Em's INTENDED gags misfired. The homeless guy saying 'what about the garbage cans? There's always something to eat in the garbage' was very funny.I also think that the library as the main setting in the second half was a very good idea. Emmerich comes from a country that has a tradition of book-burning, so the gags relating to that were to be sort of expected. They should have burnt Emmerich's scripts to keep warm...Most of the movie is all gloom and doom. However, there is a bright side: all future Oscar ceremonies will be canceled in an Ice Age! Now why didn't the movie focus on that? More optimism is what the world needs.What was the purpose of Quaid's absurd journey through Ice Age America? Just to see his son and say 'hello'? Because that's exactly what happened. He didn't get him food or medicine, he just showed up and than a little later a helicopter came to pick them all up.There was an extremely dumb scene (one of many) when the gay cowboy and his gal discussed their feelings - after half of NY was being engulfed by a tsunami! Does Em really think we the viewers give a toss about whether the sweet-voiced Gyll will hook up with his goody-two-shoes girl?Gore and his environmentalist extremist doom-sayers will be laughed at in 50 years - while this movie will be hailed as a camp classic.",Null,0,3,18 September 2007
X-Men," Why are they called 'X-Men' when half of them are women?
","Are they 'X-Men' because they're ex-men (and ex-women), or because 'X' is such a nifty little letter for sci-fi and comic-books? (Kind of like 'Z'.) All ye comic-book nerds reading this, feel free to answer me that one. I am soooo interested to find out.Ever since Mystique entered the picture I found the movie a bit laughable. All along I was thinking why Magneto (I feel very silly using these names) simply doesn't send her to impersonate the Senator and end the anti-Mutant political propaganda. And voila: in the end Magneto finally realizes that the ol' switcheroo can be used to solve their problem with the politician, so she does exactly that. Yawn.Oh, the ol' switcheroo... It's been milked dry - and then some - in 'Star Trek' (and many others), so I thought how boring and stupid to have that blue woman changing bodies all the time. With her in his 'arsenal', there is no logical reason Magneto (that dumb name again) shouldn't win this war in a flash, especially when faced against a pathetic pacifist, Patrick Stewart.We're told that mutants have special powers. Fine. However, we were never told that they all have far superior IQs, which they must have because both Stewart and Magneto (oh...) are scientifically far ahead of the rest of mankind, what with their fancy little laboratories, Star-Wars-like spaceships, and other gadgets.On the other hand, why nit-pick? I forget that this is just a dumb comic-book adaptation, unnecessarily trying to be dark.I see a lot comedic potential in this. For example, Rogue. She stuns/comatoses/kills whomever she touches. She has three encounters with Wolfy, which kind of started to get funny by the time they touched each other on the Eiffel Tower... sorry, the Statue of Liberty.All in all, watchable, but far from thrilling.I found the messages of tolerance a little pathetic - in a damn kiddie comic-book action yarn.",Null,1,2,25 September 2007
Match Point," Might Soon Yi be jealous?
","Allen's little atheistic one-liners and musings were always a nice change from the religious baloney we get in other movies. MP's basic point isn't a theme as trite as fidelity (as some people here seem to think) but the factor of luck that dominates everyone's life from the word go. Meyers got away with murder merely because the ring didn't fall into the Thames river. Sure, it's a bit fortune-cookie-ish, the 'grand' way in which this startling new philosophical revelation was presented, i.e. it can't be anything new to anyone above the age of 12 (excepting morons), but it gave Allen an opportunity to make a dull drama once again (after 'Interiors'). As we know, all comedians are miserable bastards who strive to be taken seriously, which they all seem to think can only be achieved through the channeling of their energy into drama. How stupid. Or perhaps writing a drama is much easier than coming up with something funny. Well, no 'perhaps' about it.A romantic drama, no less, for at least 90 minutes of this over-long 2-hour movie. What was he thinking? MP has the plot of a typical movie-of-the-week man-cheats-wife-and-it-all-ends-in-murder TV drama, only with marginally better acting and dialogue. Meyers is a poor boy who's made his way through tennis, he gets into a very rich family, he gets fatally attracted to his future brother-in-law's fiancée, things start getting complicated etc... Most of the movie is Meyers lying to his wife or having sex with Johansson, all of this interspersed with surprisingly stilted dialogue which reveals Allen's inability to write for straight characters. And let's not forget all the coincidences...The theme of luck serves as a very convenient excuse for all the cheap plot-devices that had characters bumping into one another in the streets of London, which isn't exactly a small Welsh mining town. Clever, Woody, clever. Nevertheless, whether you have an excuse for it or not, it's always lazy and unoriginal writing to employ such clichés/tricks.But forget luck. Now we come to the REAL purpose behind this movie: let's face it, MP was written and made as a simple excuse for Woody to film his latest female obsession - Scarlett Johansson - having sex scenes. ('Artistic muse', my a**...) Many directors have tried this sort of thing, and some even got lucky by hooking up with the star bimbo. Of course, Woody is far too old and funny-looking (trying to be diplomatic here) for Scarlett to help turn his burning-desire/fantasy into reality. They'll never become a couple, but God knows WA will be trying for years to come... ('Scarlett, honey, I have a new movie for you. Will you please play a starving, nymphomaniac hooker?' 'Of course, I will, Woody. You know that it's, like, always a huge honour to work with an artist like you, and stuff!') Draw your own conclusions as to what Woody was doing in his trailer on the days when the sex scenes with Scarlett were being shot (no pun intended)... (Damn, Hollywood is full of dysfunctional morons...)Intentional or not, MP reveals the full extent of WA's decadence and lack of morality. The theme of casually cheating on your partner with your best friend's wife/husband is nothing new to Woody. ('Husbands & Wives', as just one example.) He always presents it as something that isn't so bad. In fact, he even makes the cheaters likable. No wonder. After all, this is the man who MARRIED HIS DAUGHTER, lest we forget. Woody Allen the private person has absolutely no scruples whatsoever, hence his relatively sympathetic portrayal of two selfish adulterers, Johansson and Meyers, is not a surprise.The casting is problematic too. Meyers, who appears in just about every scene, simply isn't capable of carrying a 2-hour movie. He has the charisma of a fish. Besides, we never quite understand what exactly attracts the 'wild' Scarlett to him; he is like a lifeless android, always dull and polite. It was also predictable that the ghosts of Meyers' victims would appear at some point. Allen's fanatical devotion to the Swedish charlatan, critics' darling, and gloom-and-doom suicidario, Ingmar Bergman, is on record... Check out the poster for MP: there's a hint of Bergmanesqueness there. So blatant, so shameless.Thank God the tennis scenes were sparse. If I had been forced to watch the very unathletic Meyers hit those lousy ground strokes another minute more, I'd have freaked out. Isn't there a single male actor out there who can play just one shot properly? Pathetic. You can't show an average player hit his mediocre shots, and then expect to have us believe that he almost became a pro...",Null,2,6,27 October 2008
Yes Man," Saying 'yes' to this script was the second dumbest thing Carrey ever did - after dating Courtney Love.
","Is this a script even Adam Sandler had previously rejected? 'Sorry, guys, but it's too dumb, even for me.' Why do those cheesy 'feelgood comedies' from Hollywood always make me feel crap? If Jim Carrey continues like this, he will soon be eligible for the Steve Martin & Bill Murray No-Longer-Funny-Comedians Graveyard.Just like modern horror films cannot exist without at least two pairs of dumb/horny teens (waiting to be butchered), recent comedies cannot possibly be made without being romantic comedies. This pandering to the female audiences is ruining even potentially good comedies. Fortunately, that's where the good news come in: YM isn't one of them, i.e. the film had so little potential anyway, nothing much had been ruined by injecting into it predictable formulaic she-loves-me-she-loves-me-not schmaltz.YM has one of the most cretinous premises of all time. It's cretinously far-fetched even by 21st-century's low Hollywood standards. Saying 'yes' to everything results in predictable plot-twists, yet nothing can compare in predictability than the basic cliché ingredients of practically every single romantic comedy: 1) If the couple hooks up half-way through the film, this means that they have to split up at some point half-an-hour before the movie ends so that the film's 'mega-highlight' can consist of the pair hooking up again, and living happily ever after. Women, get those handkerchiefs out, for the romantic comedy's obligatory dull she-loves-me-after-all ending requires of you to be moved emotionally.2) Make the lead couple split up because one of them (usually the female) gets angry due to some totally silly trifle of a non-reason: Deschanel dumps Carrey for a reason so non-existent that even the script's writer probably doesn't quite understand her motives. 'You kept saying 'yes' to everything, Carl, so how do I know you really love me! You hesitated AN ENTIRE SECOND when I asked you to move in with me! Boo-hoo-hoo!' Idiotic.3) End the 100-minute romantic-comedy drudgery with a foreseeable action scene. Pointless action scenes are easy to write, and don't require any gags. They are a great way to round off the pointlessness of everything that preceded it. 'Here you go, viewers: after 100 minutes of 5 funny gags, 500 misfired ones, and several tedious 'romantic' I-love-you scenes, we present to you a nice little action scene to wake you up - or put you into even deeper slumber.' The movie did, however, elicit a big, loud laugh from me at the very end, when the end-credits said: 'YM was based on a book'. I just thought it was hilarious that someone actually wrote an entire novel with this Z-grade bubble-gum concept. Was it a children's book then?",Null,1,3,25 March 2010
Cloverfield," New York yuppies document a monster attack â€“ and their own illiteracy.
","'Dude, bro, yeah, cool, man... Whatever. Oh, and awesome, dude.' This, in a nutshell, is the kind of dialogue we're subjected to in the first 18 minutes before the monster finally arrives on the film set (he was late due to contractual negotiations). If this truly is how today's businessmen interact with each other - in 'the city that never sleeps' (and apparently 'the city whose inhabitants never build up on their vocabulary') - then good luck America... 'If you make it here you can make it anywhere': provided you're an overachieving yuppie airhead, apparently.Film-making nerds and nerdesses, how about laying off New York for a while, huh? There must be other places on the planet deserving of a monster's attention. There have got to be other cities that 'never sleep'. If I see Manhattan in another movie, I think I'll break my remote control.As seen previously in The Made-Out-Of-Thin-'(Bl)Air Witch Project' and '(Para)Normal Activity', whenever the entire movie is captured by a character waving around a camera there is bound to be much illogic regarding how and why certain scenes could have been filmed, given the extreme circumstances and camera-unfriendly situations. But never-mind that: 'Cloverfield' is 'A Clockwork Orange' compared to the afore-mentioned flicks. There is a budget here, the film isn't dull.I had to kind of wonder how it was possible that wherever the yuppies headed, the monster was there. A few theories/explanations: 1) The monster came to NY with a mission to kill yuppies. And not just any old yuppies, but our main characters. 2) The monster had a natural 'bro, dude, whassup dude, yo' radar in its brain. Hence, whenever the yuppies tried to get out of harm's way, all they needed to do is utter out loud any given moronic modern-day slang word/phrase, and the monster would be - yet again - at their tails. If this theory is correct, then maybe the suggestion that the government created the monsters was indeed true: the motive being to eradicate stupidity in a nation accelerating with leaps and bounds towards all-encompassing dumbing-down. 3) The monster felt he wasn't getting enough screen-time (and he was right: certain yuppie packs have the sick urge to place themselves at the center of attention even during a 200-meter-Godzilla attack), so in his light lizard-head he figured that killing the main characters would increase his chances in the editing room.I didn't quite understand how the unarmed, disorientated, panicky yuppies, a handful of them, managed to repel the first attack of the 'spiders'. And then the second attack. After the initial attack they even joke a bit, which certainly lends some much-needed realism... I can certainly see how people would goof off each other after just having been confronted with blood-thirsty legions from Hell.Also silly was the helicopter flying so dangerously close to the monster (so that Hud could get better footage? those military pilots are certainly quite Hud-accommodating) - and then getting predictably hit by the yuppie-hating monster.Still, there is the happy ending...",Null,5,9,25 March 2010
Silent Hill," Stuck between a hill and a hard place.
","There aren't many horror films I can think of in which the hero or heroine is stuck between two sides battling each other, both of which are equally nasty. Essentially, this is the premise: a fundamentalist Christian sect lead by a deranged woman (suitably cast with Krige) used human sacrifice to fight Satan (or at least a demon), but they played with fire rather clumsily – literally – which lead to a minor incident in which most of the population got destroyed and sent to some sort of a Hell. (It's too depressing-looking and contains far too many ugly bite-happy insects to be Purgatory.) The girl they burned (?) became the demon's BFF, but because there was still a speck of goodness left in her, a child, Sharon, was 'created' (don't ask me how); that same girl that had been adopted by Sean Bean and that actress who looks exactly like Roman Polansky's wife, the French actress Emmanuelle Seigner. The two look so much alike that for a long time I didn't realize I was watching two different women in movies! Emmanuele played Satan (or a demon?) in 'The Ninth Gate', and so we come full circle. (Well, it's a sort of circle; perhaps a pentagram.) We come full pentagram. Polansky privately also likes little girls, so we have at least two circles or pentagrams here to come full to.Anyhoo Sharon's conception is a mystery (perhaps uncovered in the sequel which I still haven't seen). Is Sharon a clone of the sacrificed girl? To make matters even more puzzling, Alessa herself also didn't have a father, so was Alessa in fact fathered by Satan (i.e. that demon)? I don't play computer games much, so if any of you computer dweebs have the answer – given as how SH is based on a computer game – let me know.I gotta say I am more than impressed with the results. Re-visiting this movie many years later only increases its quality. I went into this expecting crap precisely because it's based on a computer game – coz that sort of information that doesn't exactly fill me with hope. Quite contrary to my expectations, SH is a visually dazzling trip that shows the viewer a virtual maze of a small-town Hell (is it?); the outdoor scenes are beautiful, the indoor scenes are somber, dark and fascinating. The photography, the beasts, the sets, and the special-effects alone guarantee the movie being well above average. An interesting story helps as well. The director is a Frenchman which explains the film's high visual quality.Another positive aspect of the movie is that it wastes no time plot-wise, unlike so many horror flicks that take ages to get started. Things get going right from the outset rather than waste our time with small-talk and other introductory nonsense. The finale is rather well done, though obviously lifted from the 'Hellraiser' series, and slightly reminiscent also of the finale in 'Dark City'. But, hey: who watches horror movies expecting total originality? The downer ending isn't bad either; perhaps the main reason why the site's rating isn't much higher as it should be.Drawbacks are few, small and far between. For example, the mediocre dialogue in the church just before the mass-slaying. I thought it was a little on the cheesy side. Kim Coates' cop-portrayal was also a tad silly, but we shouldn't be surprised by such sub-par acting from the guy who brought us that silly 'ungh-ungh-ungh' semi-caveman character from 'Battlefield Earth'.",Null,1,4,10 December 2014
Crash," Hollywood preacheth and the sermon is deranged.
","This movie was literally crying 'gimme some Oscars!'. Hence, alternative titles could be 'Gimme Some Oscars For Our Blatant Unashamed In-Your-Face Preachy Political Correctness And Overblown Sentimentality', or maybe even better: '2 Days Of Absurd Coincidences In The Valley'.Phillipe, Danza, Bullock, Fraser. Wow! What a cast! Bullock has never been in a good movie so this fact alone spells trouble.Alone that scene with Dillon 'molesting' the black director's wife guaranteed this silly movie an Oscar for Best Picture. By the way, that black couple DID engage in reckless driving because the woman gave him a blow-job while he was driving, so the LEAST Dillon could have done is annoy the slut a with a bit of cop-a-feel (no pun intended). Regardless of race, this should be done to ANY slut who gives a guy fellatio while driving. The fact that Dillon happens to be a racist – as ALL cops seem to be in Hollywood movies – changes nothing.Talk about a coincidence plot-device of the DECADE, when Dillon saves the same black woman THE NEXT DAY (no, not a month later, THE NEXT DAY). And as if one such plot-device wasn't enough, we get ANOTHER coincidence not much later, when the black director – yes, the woman's husband – has an encounter with the OTHER cop from the night before, Phillipe. Phillipe is the 'good white cop'. And it is in this scene that we have the dumbest moment in the movie: the director goes berserk when the two car-thief blacks attack him – and then PREACHES to the taller one about being 'an embarrassment' to him (i.e. the black race) and LETS HIM GO, but not before HANDING HIM HIS GUN BACK!!!!!!! Those two car-thieves. What ridiculous characterization! The way they suddenly assault Fraser/Bullock is something out of a ZAZ comedy. It's as if this scene got accidentally edited into the wrong movie. The two lack credibility. They philosophize like Travolta and Jackson in 'Pulp Fiction' - except that this is supposed to be a 'deep' drama, so it comes off all wrong. First the taller one is paranoid about racism, the shorter one making fun of that, and then – inexplicably – they SWITCH PERSONALITIES: the shorter one defends rap music and makes fun of country being racist, while the taller one criticizes hip-hop for being primitive. Ludicrous? Yes: ludicrous. Aside from that, how many young black criminals who look like hip-hop actually CRITICIZE hip-hop?? This is silly and unrealistic. I half-enjoyed what was said about the rap 'culture', but it came out of the WRONG CHARACTER's mouth. Or is it supposed to be funny and ironic that Ludicrous is saying it? Ha-ha. Hilarious...We have plenty of other nonsense/coincidences that just keep piling up. The way the Persian store-keeper shoots/misses the locksmith's daughter was straight out of the 'Cheap And Overused Plot-Devices Throughout The Ages' handbook. And then we had the U.S. flag waving in the background as the Persian guy looks helplessly into the distance. It's obvious that the director completed the 'Cheap Movie-Critic-Pleasing Symbolism 101' movie course. Oh, and Fraser playing a D.A.: not as absurd as Denise Richards playing a scientist, but thereabouts.Hollywood simply cannot let it go. They HAVE to keep trying and trying to 'solve' racism in America. But how can a bunch of uneducated, uninformed hypocrites tell us anything intelligent on this subject? You want a lesson in racism? Watch an episode of 'South Park'. Or, if you want some hard, sobering facts, check out Richard Lynn's controversial studies on the subject. The fact that he is despised both by bleeding-heart liberals and the extreme Right should be a recommendation in itself.The positive sides are that the film isn't boring and I enjoyed the 'rap is crap' dialog. Also, there is at least a hint that blacks can be just as bigoted as anyone else, which shows that even Hollywood can occasionally wake up and smell the roses. The soundtrack is good – it was just placed in the wrong movie. It evokes scenes from 'The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, i.e. doesn't fit with L.A. or racism or any of that.If you enjoyed other crappy Oscar movies, there is no reason you shouldn't enjoy yet more Oscar-winning nonsense.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The weakest Kubrick is loved by everybody - for whatever reason.
","Strange. Kubrick is my favourite director but when it comes to this film - which is loved by critics and the public alike - I am not that impressed. It's not that I mind its politics; rather, the movie is simply dull. The humour doesn't work. A yokel-pilot riding a nuclear bomb over Russia and shouting 'yeeechawww' is something that might be funny in a Bugs Bunny cartoon but simply comes off as a cheap sight gag out of 'Police Academy 12'. Kubrick is as ill-suited to do a comedy as Spike Lee is to make a masterpiece (in any genre). 'Lolita' had humour, and it was good, but the movie was a comedy drama. Here Kubrick tried his hands on an all-out satire and the result is his easily weakest post-Spartacus film. The gags are somehow hollow and too obvious. If I hadn't known it was made by Kubrick I perhaps wouldn't have even guessed it.",Null,12,30,10 January 2007
Knocked Up," 'No, I don't want you to f*** me like a dog!'
","A fun sequel to the very funny '40 Year-Old Virgin'. This movie has very good casting and good one-liners going for it, the only drawback being its mammoth length of 130 minutes, far too long for a comedy.Around half-time the movie gets ever-so-slightly stuck in a rut, plot-wise, but the introduction of the cheating/spying sub-plot livened things up again.Just as with 40Y-OV, another thing I also liked about KU is that many of the characters are well-developed and interesting, and not just the two central characters, as is the case in many other movies of this kind. I also enjoyed the down-to-earth, unpretentious approach to characters and life in general, that is evident every step of the way in the script. The differences between men and women are intelligently and humorously shown, with none of that anti-male PC crap getting in the way of fun.Good choice, having Katherine Heigl cast in the lead, because she is beautiful and very good, whereas someone talentless and ugly such as Aniston or Diaz would have single-handedly ruined this comedy.One of the funnier moments is Rogen playing 'fetch' with one of Mann's daughters.",Null,0,2,26 September 2007

The Energizer Bunny Buffoon.American comedy has been in the toilet (or even all the way down in the sewer) for many years now, and the evidence for this is abundant, hundreds of pitiful movies impersonating comedies.

Taxi Driver," One of the best dramas of all time.
","The best Scorsese/De Niro picture, and that speaks volumes. Though somewhat depressing and very melancholic, this film can be viewed many times, unlike other dramas. A very unusual film in which it is impossible to predict exactly what will happen next, due to the main character's confusion and hence unpredictability. De Niro is perfectly cast, and Keitel and the young Foster are also very good. The soundtrack is excellent and the movie owes a lot to it, as well. The decadence is realistic and captured terrifically by Scorsese; the photography is superb in all its 70s grainy glory.Now, hang on to your seats!... Before Scorsese took over the project, De Palma and Spielberg were potential directors. Christ Almighty! Thank God they didn't get their hands on this script. Imagine what kind of crap they would have made out of it...The De Palma version: A lonely Vietnam vet decides to drive a taxi cab for a living, but he has to get to New York first. He travels across the country, and one day decides to spend the night at a motel where a certain Normana Bates works - played by Nancy Allen. While taking a shower on that same evening he is being attacked by Normana with a knife and cut into little pieces. The next morning Normana wakes up, thinking it was all a nightmare and goes into the kitchen to make some coffee. There she is ambushed by a perfectly healthy De Niro, who is holding the same knife he had been butchered with that very night (in the dream; or is it?)! (Makes sense? Not really. It would just get worse from there...:) Allen manages to escape from De Niro in the last moment and drives off to Mount Rushmore. Only hours later De Niro catches up with her and they get involved in a spectacular chase around the four presidential heads. While both of them are hanging on Lincoln's nose (each per nostril) Allen shouts 'Why are you chasing me?'. De Niro responds that he is working for the KGB and must eliminate her for she is an FBI agent who knows too much. Allen then denies any involvement in any spying activities, claiming she is merely a pimp. De Niro asks for proof. Allen opens her mouth to say something when suddenly another Allen appears at the top of Lincoln's head! De Niro and Allen 1 look at each other in disbelief. The mysterious Allen 2 shouts to them that they're both as good as dead. De Niro asks why. Allen 2 says it's revenge for Allen 1 using her daughter as an underage prostitute. De Niro says he had nothing to do with it, and then remembers that he has a fear of heights. He starts panicking. Allen 2 machine-guns him, saves Allen 1, and the two of them get attacked by vicious birds on their way to the motel...The Spielberg version: A Jewish rabbi - played by Whoopie Goldberg dressed as a man - decides to become a cab driver in order to get in touch with the 'real people'. One of his customers is a small alien with a heart of gold (literally) who is fighting for the rights of whales on his planet, and was sent to Earth by the planet's nasty right-wingers as punishment for his liberal activism. The rabbi offers his help, but not before inviting the alien to a trip to Disneyworld. There the rabbi and the alien meet Mickey Mouse and Goofy, who are more than thrilled to help the alien go back to his planet in time to save the whales. On their way to the Kennedy Space Center they make a dangerous enemy: an unscrupulous pimp - played by Tom Cruise - who will do anything to get the alien laid with one of his 12 year-old girls, simply for the pleasure of being the first intergalactically successful pimp (plus, he wants that golden heart). Cruise is assisted by the evil Republican Party to catch our merry bunch, while the good Democrats - who sing happy songs during the film - do everything to rescue the alien and his friends. The movie ends by the Democrats winning the Congressional, Senate, and Presidential elections and jailing all Republicans while introducing a state-run economy - not to mention helping the alien go back to his planet to save the whales. President Gore gets his life's wish fulfilled when the alien - just before lift-off - gives him advice how to save the spotted owl (the alien: 'Just kill all the humans living near its habitats, and you've saved it.')",Null,1,4,8 January 2007
Capote," 'Dead Man Walking: Part 2'.
","Let's not kid each other here. The main reason why this movie was 'recognized' by the Acadumby voters is because of its more-or-less blatant anti-death penalty message. Needless to say, I would have stayed away from this movie had I known it was just another political-issue-of-the-week drama. I should have known better, of course, than to trust an Oscar film.It is absolutely amazing to me that they would sell this movie under the title of 'Capote'. The story is about a certain part of his life, it is not nearly as biographical and extensive as it should/could have been. From what I know, his life was interesting enough to warrant a proper bio, and not this kind of moody, slow-moving small slice of the pie. The acting is good, but the script is too limited in scope.Back to the death penalty. Hollywood's obsession with promoting its damn liberal ideals is unceasing and will not/cannot cease  EVER. This much we know. It's neither the first nor last anti-death penalty movie they'll unleash at us. I do not see how we as the viewers are supposed to sympathize AT ALL with these two robbers/murderers. They kill a family ('In Cold Blood') and yet we are presented all this left-wing drivel about a poor childhood, this and that, ladida Who gives a s***?! (Of course, the killer being part-Indian exonerates him from most guilt  in the eyes of Hollywood's unintelligentsia.) They should have been hung 4 years earlier! End of story, and let's now have more about Capote. Instead, we get to study in great detail his emotional connection with one of the killers. Sorry, but this is simply not enough  and I'd trust Hollywood to have over-dramatized this relationship, too, so I can't even be sure if its even in any way justifiable, from a biographical viewpoint.",Null,3,6,29 March 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," An insult to rats everywhere.
","Won't they ever stop? But I guess as long as moronic audiences worldwide pay to see this kind of plastic, soul-less drivel, there will be 'Ocean's 14', 'Ocean's 15' and maybe even 'Ocean's 39'. And by the time 'Ocean's 88' comes out all of our brains will have drowned in that particular ocean.However, if you thought this movie franchise was more pathetic than anything else that is going on around now, think again: the incredibly transparent media hype surrounding O13 is even more pathetic. Almost every day do we get bombarded in the media by various supposedly 'witty' remarks Clooney or Damon make about each other or other cast members. Clearly, Clooney and gang a sad 'rat pack' make, so the producers needed to devise an original way of making sure that everyone in the world knew that Clooney and others were 'really cool'. Nevermind the fact that everything is probably scripted (i.e. every 'ever-so-casual' utterance) or that Clooney is about as 'cool' as one of his dead pigs, or that Damon and Pitt look like someone put women's faces on male bodies...I don't think much of the old rat pack either, but even overrated mafia midgets like Sinatra were more interesting than this sorry bunch. Dean Martin had more talent in his fixed nose than Clooney & co. combined.Aside from the movie being dull and idiotic, I was horrified to see Pacino and the ever-ugly Barkin with their new, plastic-surgery-ravaged, faces. They look grotesque. Won't anyone tell these Hollywood fools that after 30 facelifts you start looking like a bizarre creature from another planet?As for Barkin, a certain Gary B. wrote in the IMDb biography that Ellen is 'unconventionally pretty'.

Lost in Translation," Lost in nepotism - Hollywood
","Let's face it, most Hollywood celebs have kids, and they want those kids to eventually work in the lucrative movie industry with its fame and fortune and easy luxurious lifestyle, so that the family's (i.e. dynasty's) fortune expands and everyone buys even more yachts and villas while all of its members involved in film keep pretending in interviews that they're creating 'art', that they're in it for the artistic glory or some such sham. Just like politicians, their real motives are usually hidden, though very obvious.This is why almost everyone in Hollywood supports nepotism so much. They want other people's kids to succeed (hence actively support their careers) because that automatically makes nepotism acceptable which in turn means that their own kids will or could get into the business without too much hassle - and certainly with no criticism from the media which these days even acts all HAPPY when some star's talent-free/uncharismatic daughter/son/nephew starts a mediocre acting or directing career.And this is where Sofia Coppola and her decidedly overrated, pointless drama come in. Any one of tens of thousands of film-makers could have written and/or directed this exact same film - yet nobody would have noticed it. But because a Coppola directed it - the daughter of the 'Godfather' series director, no less - the whole movie world stood up and took notice, as if Martians had landed on Central Square.Granted, some people GENUINELY believe that Coppola must have inherited the 'movie gene' (some fictional, unproven DNA strain), hence their interest in her. I will refrain from commenting further on such people, i.e on their understanding of art and biology. LIT is like any one of hundreds of indie films made from the 80s onwards, but with a much richer budget. (What daddy's girl wants, daddy's girl gets.) It is one of those lazy slice-of-life dramas, in other words movies that lack a real story but simply plod along, hoping that film critics will imagine seeing some layers of 'deep meanings' in it and then convince the easily-lead mass audience that they MUST enjoy this because it is high art. (It would be comical were it not so pathetic.) Finding anything more intellectual or more meaningful or above-average in this mediocrity than one would normally find in an average TV drama requires hallucination as the main operating tool. Coppola is not only not talented, she is the opposite. She'd managed to make even Bill Murray uninteresting. Even Ana Faris, who is always interesting, struggles to be interesting. The only use I see for this film could be that it might be fun for japanophiles or people considering going there for a vacation. Japan is a fascinating country, so, yes, LIT is not bad as a sort of extended, lavish travel infomercial. But how many Travel Channel documentaries get nominated for Oscars?And yet, even visually LIT is nothing to shout about. I've seen visually more impressive and more interesting scenes of Japan with Karl Pilkington doing one of his 'An Idiot Abroad' episodes in this country. Karl was much funnier and vastly more interesting than all these average/dull characters put together, and he did it by walking around and observing Japan just as they did. Strangely enough, he was considered a buffoon while doing it (in spite of making occasionally sharp and often witty observations), whereas Sofia's characters are somehow much more 'profound' because they only make faces while watching this unusual culture unfold. Perhaps the fact that Sofia's tourists are so WITHDRAWN (hence automatically 'mysterious') whereas Karl is open and everyman about it makes Sofia's bunch more 'artistic' or 'spiritual' than Karl, dunno. The human mind is a wonder. So much confusion there.Just check out the DEPTH with which Scarlett observes a group of young Japanese men play computer games. Wow. So deeply profound: a young American blond dyevochka staring at the vastly different Japanese culture - you just CANNOT get more artistic and philosophical than that. So so many mindless arty conclusions to draw from Scarlet observing the Japanese, isn't there? That is, if one is inclined to succumb to such obvious filmic traps, not to mention succumbing to the all-powerful Oscar hype.Except that Karl's program was a travelogue, and is not supposed to be more interesting than a Hollywood movie that got bundles of Oscars. And yet it is.Laughable. Don't believe the hype. Stop believing the hype. Just because all the media raves about something isn't a reason to jump on the bandwagon. I am flabbergasted how many people fell for this classic con-trick. Sort of like a bunch of tourists gathered around a very abstract, ugly Picasso pencil-scribble in a European museum, trying desperately to find reasons to 'appreciate' it, even though their common sense (which they prefer to switch off in such instances) is telling them they're looking at a piece of junk.Someone put it best: 'I feel like this movie really banks on the idea that if you don't like it, you don't 'get' it and therefore are a plebeian. I don't like my sensibilities and ego being bribed in that way.' If everyone thought this way, movies like these would be sold in discount bins for $5 instead of being praised as masterpieces of the decade.",Null,8,15,17 July 2018
The Village," Shyamalan bores us this time around.
","A cross between Jane Austen and Stephen King, and this is not meant as a compliment. I have no idea why Shyamalan chose to make this movie so drawn out and dull in the first hour. For most of the movie this is almost your standard TV soap fare with just a bit of horror thrown in; so very dull and pointless. The chemistry between would-be lovers Phoenix and Howard is practically non-existent. (Not surprising; both of them stem from Hollywood's inexhaustible supply of talentless, nepotist youth.) What saves the movie from total failure is the clever twist ending, typical of this director. So it ends up being like a clever 'Twilight Zone' episode. Clever twist, but why all the protracted tedium in the first two-thirds? Do we really care to watch the overrated Phoenix and the ineffectual Howard talk and flirt for hours? 'Twilight Zone' episodes would never have been so effective (the good ones) had they lasted 90 minutes. That's the main problem with this film.",Null,1,2,7 January 2007
Pitch Black," If you want to be entertained, skip this one and watch the sequel.
","I was hoping, perhaps I will finally stumble upon one of those real science-fiction movies with an actual, thought-provoking story-line, which movies like 'Dark City', 'Event Horizon', 'Zardoz', 'Solaris' (1973), or '2001' have - but nay. It's just another dull, predictable, seen-it-all-before 'Alien' re-hash. Even the creatures look like the 'Alien' monsters, except that they have wings.I mean, here we have a ship crash-landing on a planet with three suns (now there's some real unscience-like nonsense, but okay: it's just a movie) and one might be forgiven to hope that maybe something unique and original will happen story-wise. But no. The survivors are threatened by bat-like creatures who suck blood. YAWN! The rest of the movie is about how the ten little crash-landers try to survive the onslaught of the totally uninteresting flying alien draculas. The first half-hour or so is not even that bad (though hardly super), but once this movie's raison-d'etre materializes in the form of little 'Aliens', it was strictly sleepy-time for me.The movie isn't even visually exceptional. The dialog is your standard crap; 'sly'/'cool' one-liners mouthed by characters created by a PC 'visionary'; the last four to remain alive are two females and two black guys. Need I say more? The blonde is supposed to be some kind of Sigourney Weaver toughy who is more than a match for many men, while the main Anglo-Saxon male turns out to be both corrupt and weak (he's a dope-addict). All the while, the mass killer, with his deep booming voice, is Vin Diesel who isn't such a bad guy after all, and even has his heart-of-gold won over eventually by the blonde to the extent that he risks his life to save people who normally/logically he shouldn't care less about (or would kill, right? Considering he's supposed to be a psychopath and all). The continuity of the blonde's character is also faulty: at the outset, she very willingly wants to sacrifice dozens of people to save her own heiny, but by the end of the movie she is prepared to give her life for just two. Where's the logic in that? The more years pass since the making of the 'Alien' trilogy (or quadrology) the less tolerant I get towards its numerous clones. True science-fiction movies, in the tradition of famous writers' sci-fi novels or stories, are so rare, and that is why it's frustrating to see even a single dollar get spent on a trite, cliché sci-fi horror story when there are so many unique plots that are out there, begging to be filmed.",Null,2,6,21 January 2007
American Psycho," A yuppie becomes a serial-killer and slays everything from cats to old ladies.
","Most of the gory details were avoided, which is probably the only interesting thing in a book which delves on the Reagan era and how evil and egotistical it was - if the movie is anything to go by. What a boring old left-wing point to make. How original and insightful! We are presented with a psychopath who is supposed to be funny as well as menacing. To mix satire or even comedy with this genre is truly stupid and cannot come to any good. Plus, a couple of scenes are dumb in the 'Nightwatch' or 'Copycat' or even 'Hitcher' vein: Bateman kills a fleeing hooker by throwing a running chainsaw down a flight of stairs - as if he spent all his life practicing for such an occasion. Of course, no one - in that large New York building - is there to see or hear the prostitute's screams or to see and hear a blood-soaked Bateman running through the hallways nude and with a chainsaw in his hands. (But perhaps the unfeeling, insensitive 80s are to blame and its selfish 80s inhabitants.) It is also unexplained how exactly he manages to clean the blood and drag the body up five or six floors to his flat without anyone seeing him and without leaving a bloody mess all over the place. But the nonsense doesn't end there. He also kills an old woman because she saw him pointing a gun at a cat (plenty of stray cats in Manhattan, of course) and after that he goes on a killing spree after which he weeps and confesses his crimes to a lawyer by phone. A psychopath with a guilty conscience?! Later, he meets the lawyer and tells him that he is Bateman and that the phone message was no joke, and that he killed the character Paul. To this the lawyer says that he had dinner with Paul twice in the last ten days! What the hell is that?? Did he imagine it all? Yet there is no indication at all that he imagined it all. And even if he had: what's the point?! Plus, he doesn't seem like the type of serial killer who would be dumb enough to try and kill his secretary, especially since a detective already hangs around him a lot.It was clear to me from the very start of the preparations for the making of this movie that there was a lack of seriousness about it: they wanted Di Caprio to play the lead! Di Caprio the serial killer. No wonder the movie turned out so bad. Considering this, then maybe Bale wasn't such a bad choice. They actually fixed Bale's very English teeth so that they would look 'perfect', i.e. yuppie-like, for the role. Instead, it looks as if he is wearing one of those very cheap, fake, bright-white vampire teeth (minus the fangs). So what have we learned from this mess? Serial-killer thrillers are hitting new lows (i.e. highs) in stupidity, and bad novels should not be filmed. This piece of crap even has a sequel.",Null,13,29,30 December 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," A funny child actor: a first.
","I was expecting a commercial, unfunny, formulaic comedy. In fact, judging by the high IMDb rating I was sure this was a turkey. However, I was amazed that the masses sometimes get it right.LMS is a kind of mix of indie-style comedy and Hollywood formula. It isn't self-indulgent, badly acted crap nor is isn't entirely predictable. Arkin is finally once again cast to play what he does best: a grumpy un-PC a**hole. It's just a pity that he is killed off half-way. Collette is almost invisible, her character being the least colourful, but it's always nice to have her in any movie. The others are good, too - even Kinnear doesn't annoy as much as he's able to; that, though, may have a lot to do with the fact that he plays someone much like himself: a slimy little vermin.But the biggest surprise was the little girl. Normally, I can't stand kids in movies; either they're dull, unfunny, can't act or annoying wise-a**es with an IQ of 188. It was refreshing to see a kid character who is completely normal for her age, behaving in a natural way - and very funny, especially in the finale when she shocks everyone with Grandpa Arkin's choreography.A wise choice was the soundtrack; not your typical chart-driven bubble-gum pop and (c)rap songs, but a proper movie soundtrack.Not everything works in LMS, but overall it's quite an entertaining affair. Very few good comedies in last years, what with the downright awful Owen Wilson/Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler vehicles.The funniest thing about LMS is the sound of the faulty car-horn; its pathetic wailing represents the suffering of the its human cargo rather well.",Null,2,3,19 March 2008
North by Northwest," Terrorists, take notes.
","Hitchcock is famous for saying that actors are like cattle and for treating them that way. So-far-so-good. The snag is that he also treated his viewers like cattle, or sheep. Hitch may have had a chip on his shoulder regarding his appearance, but he definitely felt intellectually superior to just about everyone else. (Kinda like myself.) Unfortunately, that intellectual 'superiority' never really translated itself into the scripts. His legendary (yet overlooked) disregard for common sense and his disdain for maintaining at least a modicum of realism make him a sort of Svengali who paved the way for bumbling logic-haters such as De Palma, Woo, Argento – just to name the most obvious makers of idiotic thrillers.NBN is somewhat of a comedy too, but not all-out, which means it's subject to logic-hole dissection. There are glaring logic problems, nonsense of monumental proportions.Grant leads cops to the villa where he was held hostage, which had been open despite the real owner later stating that it was all closed up. Sillier still, the crooks (for some bizarre reason) turned part of the library into a mini-bar. One of the stupidest scenes in cinema history is when Grant opens the mini-bar to show it to cops but finds only books. I'd expect that in a Python sketch, not in a movie that purports to be a spy thriller: you know, an actual tale of crime-and-espionage that is supposed to deal with real humanoids, as opposed to all-knowing/all-powerful cardboard characters. Well, not quite so powerful: they don't drug Grant enough to prevent him from speeding away. Nor are they smart enough to realize that the man they're looking for doesn't even exist. Mason trusts his goons implicitly: if they say that Grant is Kaplan, then he MUST be Kaplan! Despite the fact that even an amoeba would've figured out half-way through the film that Grant was a victim of mistaken identity; but Mason still doesn't get it. Mason plays a moron, you see. Sure, he's a suave and cunning secret agent and all that – but also a moron. That's Hitchcock for ya: wants to have his (huge) cake and eat it too. Nor does it make sense that the goons mistake Grant for Kaplan in the first place – considering he doesn't exist hence they can't know what he looks like.Mind-boggling is that supremely idiotic elevator-laughing scene. For a moment there, I thought I was watching an Ed Wood movie or a Luc Godard turkey. It was that clownish. You can't take anything seriously after that. But not nearly as dumb as what follows. The murder scene in the UN epitomizes everything that's wrong with Hitchcock's movies: they not only insult the viewer's intelligence (admittedly, I might be in the minority here), it insults amoeba intelligence too. (Amoebas are integral to this review.) If amoeba were dumb enough to watch Hitchcock films (and I hear they're not), they'd laugh at that scene. Grant talking to a UN politician – just as someone stabs him from behind – is the stuff of B-movie cheese. Even pulp fiction comic-books have more dignity. This had been a pythonism before Python was even formed. If only terrorists realized how easy it is to kill politicians! Those stupid terrorists and their bombs and their intricate assassination plots: so bloody unnecessary. Hitchcock shows them how easy it can be! You just wait for someone to talk to your victim and then you stab your target in the back and run away – while the other person gets all the blame! It's so simple, duh. Come on, terrorists, you're so dumb to use bombs and plan things for months. I don't know who wrote Hitchcock's scripts, whether he hired lobotomized amoeba or just fellow misanthropes who thought that every single viewer was a booger-eating cretin, but I do know that whoever wrote the NBN script must have thought that it would be nifty to have a kamikaze pilot chase Grant around. Don't get me wrong, the plane-chase segment is the absolute highlight of this overrated movie, but the pilot must have been a WW2 Japanese who thought the war was still on. Because why else would he crash into the truck? Who the hell gave this guy a pilot's license? Does Mason hire incompetent fools? (His goons can't even tell humans apart.) He seemed to be fine dusting crops, but once he started chasing Grant (which was kinda 10000:1 in his favour) all his pilotary skills just evaporated. Or, as I suggested, he was Japanese and thought Grant was holding a secret message to the President about the Emperor's whereabouts. But even then, you'd expect him to be a little more accurate and hit the front of the truck. (You know, if Hitch ever did make a movie about an American trying to assassinate Hirohito, I bet the entire plot would be set in Kansas instead of Japan. Not to mention that Hirohito would be played by Gary Cooper, coz that's how they cast movies back then.)After the chase, Grant locates the blonde who'd set him up to be killed. Ever the 'Golden Era' gentleman, Grant doesn't mind too much that she was responsible for him being nearly cut up into pieces by a propeller. He is still fairly affable toward her, all things considering, if a little sarcastic and moody. It's the kind of 'old-school' nonsense we get to see in such flicks.Eventually Grant finds out the truth from the old geezer, yet he doesn't scream at him for allowing her to set him up in the desert. Is Grant that dumb then? Not only that, we're supposed to root for Grant who wants to spoil CIA's plans just so he can get it in with the blonde. So their love-affair is more important than (inter)national security? The decision to run away via Mount Rushmore is pretty bloody stupid too.",Null,4,11,16 October 2016
Knowing," In 1959 a Bert I. Gordon script gets dumped into a vault, then resurrected 50 years later by Tinseltown's 'finest'.
","A couple of dull kids, a useless prophecy, rock-collecting Nostradummies, and a pair of white bunnies. No wonder Cage was cast in this turkey.'This is not the end', says Cage's religious Papa - mere minutes before the movie ends. Was I the only one laughing?Only 10 minutes into the movie, and the cretinous Hollywood liberal propaganda machine strikes: Cage's annoying kid tells his lethargic Dad that he wants to become a vegetarian, and because the kid seems to have a 1556 IQ, this is naturally supposed to translate into 'see? see? it's intelligent people who turn vegan'. Audiences are generally easily brainwashed, but I still don't think Hollywood will succeed in making even 2-3 people stop eating delicious, HEALTHY meat products due to pitiful 'ads' such as this. Since when are PETArds commissioned to write science-fiction scripts, anyway? Granted, they do know a thing or two about fantasy since they live in a self-made world of utter FICTION, but they know zip about SCIENCE. I suspect that the first draft might have even included a scene in which the Nostradummies send vegan recipes to Earthlings - in form of confusing series of numbers, of course, because these aliens a**holes like playing mind-games with us poor human slobs. 'Hey, let's see if they figure out this one!' The first 10 minutes are over, and we're already bombarded with not one but TWO kids, one of which is a smart-ass. Must Spielberg's cheesy influence spread into every fantasy movie? X-File-ish, 'mysteeeeeerious', mute aliens. But at least they weren't effeminate-looking or as indiscriminate as the bug-eyed Spielbergian morons in 'Close Encounters OTTK': those miserable creatures even let Richard Dreyfuss aboard! At least Proyas's Nostradummies had the sense to refuse Cage the much-coveted Galactic Visa, in spite of his whiny pleading. After all, who needs the Coppola Clan spreading their talentless seed throughout the universe? If there is anything positive to be said about Armageddon it's that it'd forever extinguish all traces of Barrymore, Arquette, Carradine, Coppola and Fonda DNA.I'm mystified about the choice of bunnies, though. Why white? Do the leather-clad Nostradummies have something against yellow, gray, or black bunnies? Alien racists?... And why bunnies, of all critters? The aliens chose humans according to criteria such as intelligence and political correctness, yet are bunnies known for being smart? Or were hares simply too cute/snuggly for our Nostradummies to resist taking them aboard too?Nostradummies predict the future (in minute detail, unlike Nostradamus's ridiculously vague poems), and yet they make no proper use of this knowledge: 'Listen, y'all, we must warn these Earthlings of a series of cataclysmic events, but we don't really want the warning to bear fruition. Basically, we want humanity to perish – while appearing like do-gooders. So no intergalactic e-mails. We'll provide them with dates/locations as random-looking sequences to some selfish, semi- autistic girl.' If they're so psychic, why fail preventing the 50-year vault fiasco? How come they are psychic in the first place? (We're supposed to take that at face value - just because they're oh-so ALIEN.) Why would they bother with the list at all? (They could have just as easily appeared in the year 2009, picked up the kids'n'bunnies, and flown away - without all the Cage-related hoopla.) Why didn't the girl warn the world about each disaster? Was she a bitch, then? If the aliens are so nice why didn't they organize a major rescue party for more than just a few lucky kids and a pair of horny white bunnies? Why would the list even predict so many comparatively minor disasters when a huge one is about to strike? Why would the aliens wait until the LAST MOMENT to pick up their few 'chosen ones'? (And then dump them on some Utopist planet where white bunnies can eat their grass and shag all day) A plethora of loose ends and logic holes; I could have swore De Palma wrote it.An alien race of 'whisperers' (they can do just about any trick in the 'Intergalactic Magic Manual') refuse to talk to humans, yet they have this vague intention of trying to save them. Basically, the whole thing was a charade, orchestrated just so Cage could wave a baseball bat while playing a scientist(!) in a daft Hollywood big-budgeter Why are all those peacenik Hollywood aliens always so friggin' uncommunicative? And why are they always so THIN? But I guess that's because they're vegan, hence eat 'healthy': the two bunnies are safe... Nostradummies send adult bunnies, but when it comes to humans they only want the young? Are the bunnies supposed to tutor and guide the human kids through puberty and adolescence? No? Then who is?? Don't those all- KNOWING aliens know how useless rabbits are as mentors?You gotta love the schmaltzy 'agnostic-scientist-becomes-believer-again' cliché ending, accompanied by the rape of Beethoven's 6th. They should have played some violins instead. 'Son-hugs-Papa in a at-long-last- family-reunion'. At least in 'Signs' we had an ex-priest re-discover his faith, but here it's an astro-physicist. Proyas tried desperately to make KNOWING philosophical, but the flick ends up like a MacDonald's balloon with 'I think therefore I am' scribbled on it. KNOWING glorifies nonsense, while trying to make atheists and real science look foolish. Proyas's ambitions were lofty – but so were Ed Wood's. The ending is supposed to be poignant, glorious yet devastating, humbling, thought-provoking, awe-inducing/hope-inspiring, disturbing. But it just ends up looking like another mindless Cage vehicle. Still, I've seen worse end-of-the-world, Sun-behaving-badly flops. Just think of 'Sunshine'. Or 'Last Night': it's got Sandra Oh in it. She makes Cage look like Claudia Cardinale.Love the last scene: the kids (as Adam & Eve, get it? get it?? the aliens are God) chuck away their bunnies, then walk towards the Great White Tree of Gondor.

Doctor Zhivago," Yet another grand Hollywood story, but with plenty of flaws.
","While much better than Lean's 'Ryan's (Slutty) Daughter', it has a number of flaws, some similar to that film; like it, the acting is mostly wooden and the dialogues aren't much better. And miscasting is evident. Shariff is bland and seems out of place. Guinness and Richardson look about as Russian as Queen Latifah, and Guinness acts like a robot in his character's earlier-life segments. Geraldine Chaplin can be no one's love interest; the woman is plain ugly. (Down with nepotism!) Someone like Shariff wouldn't give her a second glance (and would regret for looking at her the first time, and might vomit for a while), even if he did grow up with her. He should get a medal for all the hugging and kissing scenes he had to endure with her, and it must have been an immense relief and pleasure for him to have kissing and hugging scenes with Christie, as well. Geraldine Chaplin's face reminds me of that mentally-retarded banjo-playing kid in 'Deliverance'. Courtenay is also miscast; plus: not all that Russian-looking either. Steiger, and in particular Christie, make the best impression. Christie's charisma makes up for some lack of emotional spark in the movie. As tragic as the events in the movie are, it isn't all that emotionally involving. The kids in the film are bad actors; the kid at the very beginning stands at the funeral looking so bored I could have sworn he could hardly wait for the shot to be over so that he could play with his Superman doll. Shariff's son slaps him on the face without emotion, or reason, for that matter. That whole scene looks fake.The story's greatest weakness is its series of outrageous coincidences; everyone seems to be bumping into each other - and this is the vast Russia we are dealing with, not some remote village in Wales. There are about a half-dozen of these 'chance meetings', and they eventually start eating away at the movie's credibility. The ending, where Shariff dies from a heart-attack upon seeing Christie for the first time in many years and after having chased after her, is so overly dramatic and far-fetched that his death doesn't have the impact that it should have (plus, it was clear from Guinness's intro speech that he'd have to die eventually).Still, the cinematography is very nice, and any movie that can make me sit through it for three hours has to be interesting enough to warrant that kind of attention. I have to add, though, that there are somewhat dull moments, as well. Some scenes are plain irrelevant; e.g. when Shariff stops writing poetry to go briefly outside and get the wolves away from the house. Later, Christie expresses her fears to him about a wolf outside; I would think that with all the communists about, the least of their worries should be the damn wolves. The train sequences in the middle also weren't too interesting. There is a blatant historical error in the film: it is implied that Lenin and his gang overthrew the Tsar. Not so. Lenin and his demented squad of maniacs overthrew those who overthrew the Tsar. The October (November) Revolution is a myth in a sense. (Go look it up.) The main melody is a classic, I guess, though a bit too uplifting for this sort of story, and is played mostly when Shariff is looking at the Moon or observing the flora. (The melody has then been even more immortalized by being used on the first Mr.Bungle album.)",Null,7,16,5 January 2007
The Shining," Probably the best horror film ever made.
","Visually stunning, with a degree of eeriness only Kubrick and very few others could have achieved; some of the scenes are unsurpassable in this respect. The cinematography is immaculate; Kubrick even makes the toilet look good. Nicholson is incredible; what he does isn't overacting - it's just what the film and story needed. (He has been often criticized for his performance here.) After all, he is going insane, right? Shelley Duvall is excellent, too, and well-cast.I can't believe they re-did this; what's the point? That moron Stephen King should be forever flattered that the best director of all time decided to pick up one of his crummy books and make a movie out of it. In fact, this dumb-looking bird-brain has even criticized Kubrick's adaptation of his irrelevant little novelette! Stephen King criticizing Kubrick is like a guy in a wheelchair criticizing his boxing coach for not making him the WBA heavy-weight champion of the world (with the difference that Kubrick made something out of 'Shining'). King criticizing Kubrick is like an eight year-old telling Einstein that his theories are stupid. King criticizing Kubrick is like Michael Moore criticizing Mark Twain's writing. King criticizing Kubrick is one of the biggest jokes in the history of mankind. If you still want to watch the remake, your problem.Excellent soundtrack, similar to that of '2001'.

"I, Robot"," Asimov is not spinning in his grave.
","The 3 Laws of Smithsonics:1. Annoy the viewers with phony grins and dumb jokes 2. If you're not playing a comedy, be only slightly less annoying 3. If they miscast you in an SF movie, show your muscles as much as possibleProyas's 'Dark City' was terrific, but I was reluctant to go anywhere near this movie due to Will Smith's amateurish presence. But if 'Dark City' could get away with having that entirely talentless charisma-less Kiefer Sutherland, then certainly 'I, Robot' could withstand a mediocre Smith. Smith's acting range isn't much better than Schwarzenegger's, but at least this kind of miscasting cannot even begin to compare with him playing Ali (what were they thinking??). The movie offers a good, logical story, with twists that are surprising but not idiotic, and some great visuals, especially in the second half. I was fearful of Smith's annoying gags and one-liners, and, yes, there were several to squirm/cringe to, but fortunately the other afore-mentioned positive factors make up for it. I just wish they'd make more true SF, i.e. the kind in which the main character is not a cop.There was one scene in particular in which Will Smith exposes his lack of acting ability: the scene in which he relates the story of the drowned girl. The (tragic/sad) faces he makes here are... well... tough to watch.",Null,1,2,31 August 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The future maker of 'Avatard' goes back in time to add some new scenes.
","James Cameron is no intellectual; that much we know. He is great with action scenes and special effects, but when it comes to character, plot, casting, and logic – forget about it. So when someone accuses him of treating his audiences as imbeciles, one must be careful. He isn't necessarily treating them any different than he'd treat himself. To him, dumb plots = intelligent plots; he doesn't differentiate. A plot is a plot, and an actor is an actor. He is quite autistic that way.T2 is a very entertaining movie, but its plot is full of logic holes and stupid little plot-devices. It swims in cameronian nonsense. I guess this was just a warm-up for the REAL nonsense to come: 'Titanic' and especially 'Avatard'.First, let's pick on the most obvious target: the time-travel. Any movie whose central premise revolves around time-travel is going to run into heavy complications, by default. If Schwarzenegger chose to go back to, let's say, September 1991, why didn't the evil robots send their assassin to August 1991? Or even better: to 1989? And that's just a snippet of the logic-problems that arise whenever time-travel is thrown into the mix. I won't go into the rest; I would exceed my 1000-word limit on that topic alone. Suffice it to say that if there is one point in the past that one can visit, then there must be gazillions of them, an infinity of past points; all these worlds co-existing in the same universe – which is why time-travel (into the past at least) isn't physically possible (despite what fame-starved astrophysicists such as Michio Kaku claim).Before I go on to the other nonsense, let me just point out to the incredibly stupid time-travel-related paradox of the 1st Terminator robot (1984) providing the knowledge (with his severed robotic arm) to Cyberdyne Corporation that lead them to eventually destroy the world – which in turn leads to a series of events that get the 1st Terminator sent in the first place! It's self-contradictory, illogical and insane.As for characterization, startlingly dumb is Sarah Connor's behavior and her empty-headed decision-making process. Instead of playing it smart – by pretending that the story about annihilation and robots is nonsense – she acts out like a bona-fide mad-woman, ensuring a permanent stay in the maximum-security loony-bin. Dumber yet, when she finally gets a chance to be released, i.e. when the cops show up to interrogate her regarding Schwarzenegger's renewed appearance, she decides to not co-operate at all. Later on (only in the Director's Cut) she actually wants to SMASH Arnie's tiny brain with a hammer, in spite of the fact that this act would be tantamount to shooting yourself in the foot, the other foot, both arms and the neck; after all, don't they need him as defense against Melty? In other words, the mother of mankind's savour is an imbecile. Gives us all hope, huh? The fact that Cameron actually added this scene to his Director's Cut – i.e. amplified Sarah's idiocy – speaks of Cameron's own tiny intellect. Linda Hamilton's unfortunate casting is yet another example of why directors shouldn't cast their wives – and why most actresses marry directors. Eastwood casting Locke: big mistake. Tim Burton casting Helena Bonham Carter: dumb dumb dumb.As flawed as this Sarah Connor character is (and so unattractive, with that damn masculine face, a lack of curvature and boobs, and those disgusting wiry Madonna arms), her son is far worse. Here we have a juvenile delinquent, totally amoral and reckless – yet this is supposed to be THE savior of mankind? There is a particularly 'disturbing' scene (in the sense that it is so stupid it's almost smirk-worthy) in which the kid screams for help when Arnold holds him by the arm. Later, when help does arrive – by which time the kid feels no longer threatened by Arnie – he tells the two good Samaritans: 'take a hike, bozos' and calls one of them 'a dumb jock'. THIS is the savior of mankind? Really, James? The only conclusions I can draw from this scene are: 1) a confirmation of Cameron's stupidity (and perhaps even a skewered sense of morality; fancy that in a libtard?), and 2) a rising suspicion that Cameron was a nerd often bullied at school by 'jocks' (i.e. alpha males that nerds detest, partly out of jealousy), and that this scene was his way of 'getting back at them'. There is nothing more embarrassing than a scorned, scarred-for-life ex-nerd trying to sort out his adolescent mental frustrations on the big screen. Connor Junior also wears a Public Enemy T-shirt; a well-known shmip-shmop group that wrote racist lyrics aimed against Jews, Koreans and Caucasians. But that's Cameron for you; he is a libtard, so obviously his ethics will be a 'little' out there.Which brings me to the abysmal casting of this 'child savior'. Has anyone ever heard of a hermaphroditic alpha male who leads millions of men into battle? I haven't. There are no historical records that support any such case. Leaders of men (and often even female leaders of men) have an excess of testosterone, not estrogen. And yet Cameron, in his infinite lack of wisdom, taste, and common sense cast an effeminate boy-girl to portray Connor. Furlong is so girly in every manner that he makes Di Crapio look like the neighbourhood butcher. Was Leo unavailable to play a Saviour of mysterious gender? Many people complained about Furlong being supremely annoying and they're mostly correct. To be fair, Furlong isn't a bad actor at all. He is just badly miscast. Acting 'talent' isn't the issue here. After all, Al Pacino would also know exactly how to play this kid – but who would believe that a 50 year-old Pacino is an 11 year-old kid?",Null,1,6,10 December 2014

Stop right there. This is not that kind of review. Instead, I will give you several reasons why you should watch Homer Simpson and his 'Spider-Pig' rather than this or any other 'Spiderman' sequel.1. Spider-pig is funny. Tobey is merely sleepy and boring. 2. Spider-pig walks on the ceiling with grace. Tobey doesn't. He looks like an apathetic, clumsy 30 year-old moron impersonating a teenager. 3. Spider-pig has a great sidekick: Homer. Spiderman has none. 4. Homer's relationship with Spider-pig is far warmer and real than Spiderman's could ever be with Kirsten Dunst. 5. Spider-pig has Danny Elfman's likable tune to follow his zany adventures. Tobey/Spiderboy has only crap commercial U.S. truck-driver rock to accompany his every sleepy move. (Note those always semi-closed eye-lids; rumours say 500 angry tse-tse flies stung him...)6. Spider-pig emits huge amounts of toxic excrement as a way to hurt his enemies. Spiderboy just shoots unconvincing CGI strings. 7. Spider-pig is much more handsome than Tobey Maguire. 8. Spider-pig is alert and quick. Tobey is drowsy and dull. 9. The pig that plays Spider-pig is a much better actor than Tobey Maguire.The only aspect in which Raimi's Spiderman franchise beats Spider-pig is that Tobey's girlfriend Dunst is much better-looking than Spider-pig's sow mistress.The success of the 'Spiderman' movies proves two things, first and foremost: 1) today's film-goers will watch any crap and love it, as long as it's hyped properly and sufficiently, and 2) Sam Raimi will never make another movie that comes even within light-year distance of his first two 'Evil Dead' movies.If you loved 'Spiderman', you must be either 9 years old or a...",Null,6,14,13 October 2007
Dark City," Terrific sci-fi is very rare.
","Finally real science-fiction, as opposed to an umpteenth version of a dull monstrous alien killing off a bunch of dull humans. An original, thought-provoking premise is brought to the screen with impressive slickness. The visual style is impeccable; the look of the city is unique. Proyas created a world all of its own, one can't even say that it's a rip-off of 'Blade Runner'. The mystery unfolds gradually, until a key scene in which Hurt finds out the ugly/fascinating truth and dies. (Perhaps the movie's highlight.) The only flaws are the casting of Kiefer Sutherland, and the somewhat formulaic ending which doesn't quite match the quality that preceded it. Thankfully, Kiefer is a supporting actor here, otherwise this movie would have been hard to watch. He is an awful actor, like most nepotistic offspring, and his strange way of talking in DC doesn't work at all; it doesn't make him seem eccentric but merely laughable. Fortunately, there is a whole half-hour in which Kiefer has no appearances. Proyas seems to be a very talented guy, but I'm not so sure about his casting: he put (up with) Will Smith in the main role in 'I, Robot'.In case the plot here starts reminding you of something, it'll probably be 'Matrix' and maybe some other movies that deal with reality, that were made later ('13th Floor', for example).

Cross of Iron," Doesn't look much like a Peckinpah movie.
","Whether you like COI or not, that silly nursery rhyme in the opening credits will stick with you for a while. Pure brainwashing, like a goddamn Britney Spears chorus that won't go away because you've heard it a 1000 times.COI is an odd war movie, which isn't necessarily bad. For one thing, it's from the point of view of the desperate German army. The attempt to 'humanize' the soldier fighting for Hitler only succeeds partly. The reason it doesn't - and never can - fully succeed is that there couldn't have been nearly as much individualism among the German ranks as is presented here. A German corporal, who is an efficient exterminator of enemy soldiers, risking his neck by keeping a Russian boy as prisoner? Gimme a break. Well, 'Russian'... This Russian is played by Slavko Stimac, a Serb kid famous for his awful Yugoslavian movies in the 70s and 80s. Dyed blonde, he looks even more ridiculous. Also absurd was his playing of the mouth harmonica when caught by Coburn's troops. What was that all about? Another strange/silly moment was when Senta Berger said 'long live Germany', just as Coburn was leaving her for good; that didn't make much sense in light of the way her character was established previously. Additionally, a nurse as good-looking as Berger throws herself at Coburn, and then HE leaves HER, because of his sense of duty! Too Hollywood, too Hollywood for me...A problematic factor in an American production about Germans are the accents/language. Either you get German actors who will all speak in German (an approach that would guarantee box-office disaster), or you let your international crew speak English the way they normally do. Listening to Coburn and Warner speak English 'like Germans' doesn't quite work; it comes of as silly more than anything else.However, although the movie drags at times, I do like that ending in which Coburn laughs semi-hysterically; it was almost the only way to intelligently finish the story.",Null,5,14,30 April 2008
The Machinist," Finally another great film in this p***-poor movie decade.
","First thing's first: I think Christian Bale is insane. To risk one's health  and life - for a mere movie is something I don't understand at all  even if it's a great movie such as this. Perhaps he is 'The Masochinist'. It is absolutely amazing to see how much weight he'd lost for this role; I guess he must have lost around half of the initial weight. And like a true 'method' actor he must have hung out with fashion models to learn the tricks of the trade. It is also quite possible the director went through several actors before finally finding one who was willing to do this to himself. Fortunately he ended up with Bale, because I have to say that he has never been this good. I also have to mention here how key it was for the director to cast the right person for the role of Bale's conscience. (I wouldn't be surprised if he worked as a Brando impersonator.) The movie is one of the very best  made in this decade  that I've seen. The theme of reality has been explored quite well in a half dozen films that came out around the turn of the millennium, and this is another great addition. The photography is superb (creating a unique look, so essential to a movie of this nature), the soundtrack is refreshingly traditional, i.e. reminding of 50s/60s thrillers, the entire cast is good, the premise is original, the dialogue convincing, and the conclusion is not a let-down. I loved the way Anderson decided to have all the dialogue put through a special effect, giving the entire movie an even stranger, unique feel than it already would have had.Essential viewing, needless to say.",Null,9,14,27 March 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Quite watchable, but Rowling's (flawedly conceived) world fails to impress me.
","I haven't read any of the books (I have much better things to do with my time), but perhaps that makes me more qualified to judge the movies on their own merit. HP 3 is a visually terrific movie, entertaining although not exactly gripping, with predictably good special-effects, and a top adult cast (Gambon, Rickman, Oldman, and Thewlis).However, I have some problems with the logic and the characterization. Rowling has fallen into the same trap as many authors of kids' books and movies to portray half the adults as raving morons. (Just pandering to the young readers, nothing new...) It would seem that Malfoy has more leverage hence real power than all the teachers combined; he basically gets that 'chicken' to be executed and loses Coltrane the job, instead of getting himself punished. I'm told by an avid HP fan that Snape (Rickman) covers for him, but surely this Snape cannot have THAT much power in the school. (And if he does, then the other teachers are morons for letting him.) Additionally, Malfoy is such a walking cliché as the 'evil brat' that he ceases to be either interesting or effective as HP's same-age nemesis. The constant snickering is too cheap a gimmick even for crappy comic-books, plus there is the total illogic of how Malfoy can possibly be a leader for his friends when he displays extreme cowardice every ten minutes. Fantasy or not, a movie has to follow at least the most rudimentary rules/laws of human (group) psychology. Why Malfoy isn't abandoned 20 times over by his friends is beyond me. Evidently, Rowling has never been a boy (or?) so she doesn't understand how boys think. A leader does NOT strengthen his position by whining like a school-girl ten times a day. It's just absurd i.e. Malfoy's behaviour is total overkill, lacking the slightest subtlety or logic.Another typical cliché is HP's character. Rowling succumbs yet again to a typical trap that female authors fall into when developing a main character who is a boy, and that is that she created the image of a semi-nerdy Harry Potter - much like Sue Townsend's absurdly unrealistic wimpy, annoying Adrian Mole. Why do women sympathize so much with the delta male boy? Why not make HP be an alpha-male in-the-making? But Rowling is more concerned with making tons of money as quickly as possible, i.e. cashing in on the hype while it lasts, than with writing water-tight stories or avoiding some unnecessary clichés. Sure, the books have more detail hence should be less illogical than the movies, but I have been told by HP readers that many of my criticisms can be extended to the books as well. Besides... even if the books were flawlessly written (which I doubt) she is ultimately responsible for the movies' quality hence its flaws.The scene in which HP is confronted with Sirius for the first time is messily written. If Thewlis and Oldman had a gram of intelligence they would tell HP straight away that it is the 'mouse' that they want to kill, and not him. 'Let's kill him' is a misleading plot-device meant to create suspense, but at the expense of logic. Why would HP prevent Snape from killing or capturing Sirius? Just because he found out Sirius is his godfather? It doesn't wash.If Hermione (what a dumb, dumb name) is so clever, so quick to make the right decisions, so strong-willed, so hard-working, so powerful, why doesn't she simply destroy Voldemort in this third part and solve everyone's problems? It's absurd that Hermione plays the leader in the movie's finale, with HP seeming lost and confused, never sure what to do next, following Hermione like some obedient, weak-willed puppy. Is this Rowling's nod to feminism? If HP is the main character - and especially 'The One' - where are his leadership qualities or his cleverness?The casting of Harry Potter is weak. Radcliffe is bland, insufficiently charismatic for the role. But what could one expect? It was nepotism at work, yet again...There are some cute scenes, as with HP trying to open the 'Monsters' Book'.On the extra DVD, someone from the crew actually said that the dementors have been made out to look unique, 'like something that has never been seen before' on film. Tolkien's/Jackson's wraiths, anyone?Rowling and the HP filmmakers have borrowed so much from Tolkien/Jackson, that they should at least have the decency to admit to it and not lie through their teeth.The director Cuaron went on to make one of the worst films of this decade, 'Children Of Men'.

The Commitments," Bronagh Gallagher: what a face.
","I remember well the (MTV) hype surrounding TC. One would have thought that Jesus wrote and directed this movie, the way it was pushed by the media, the video clip having been played incessantly by every music programme/channel. Fact is, it's a decent little movie, but absolutely nothing special - especially if you get headaches, the way I do, when exposed to more than 3 seconds of so-called 'soul' music. (Is it called that way because it kills the soul?)There are obvious similarities to Parker's earlier 'Fame'. The one that sticks out the most is how adamant Parker must have been in picking out an ugly bunch (with very few exceptions) once again. (It's the old 'ugly people = realism' credo.) Still, no need to panic: the cast of TC is not nearly as visually unappealing as the one in 'Fame'. However, unlike 'Fame', which gets serious occasionally, this Irish-based rags-to-almost-riches story can be classified as a comedy. A comedy musical, alas. The second half features far too many musical numbers, and they drag on for too long. As I said, 'soul' can be rather migraine-inducing; it is rather simplistic, unimaginative, lowest-common-denominator music, designed to please the true tone-deaf non-connoisseurs among music fans. Andrew Strong may have a great voice for this dull style, but whenever a (white) guy tries to imitate the annoying throat-barks of James Brown, or that overrated bore Joe Cocker, I am overcome with an urge to throw things at whatever the source of the sound may be. Strong is also the funniest cast member.If it's true that Parker picked out only non-actors for the band, then hats off to him, because there is nothing wrong with the acting; there is very little to indicate that all these people were amateurs. That, naturally, also brings us to the distinct possibility that basically anyone can act - given the right director. The bleedin' obvious, of course...There aren't any true laugh-out-loud moments, but the gags don't totally bomb, either. TC is basically interesting rather than funny.One of the things I liked is that musicians and singers are portrayed as the true morons they (mostly) are in real life.As far as Bronagh is concerned: if you've never seen her, just try to visualize the name 'BRONAGH' and you might come close to imagining her face. It's no wonder Lucas had her killed off within minutes of the start of 'Phantom Menace'.Why is one of the Corr sisters in the movie, but without a singing part?",Null,3,16,25 December 2007
The Butterfly Effect," The unintentional hilarity saves this junk from the lowest rating.
","First of all, I haven't laughed during a 'thriller', much less a 'sci-fi thriller', this much in years. They should have called the film 'Those Damn Vibrating Letters'. Or perhaps 'Comedy Of Errors', because whichever new reality Ashton creates - it turns into a complete disaster, either for him, for someone else, or for everybody in his life. I can see Laurel & Hardy in Ashton's role, screwing up one time after another  in a zany slapstick comedy. But Ashton in this role, and in a THRILLER?! I think not.This film is a cross between the very good 'Sliding Doors', in which alternate destinies are explored, and '12 Monkeys', which plays with time-travel. Just having one of these two premises is complex enough to handle for such lousy writers as the two who wrote 'Butterfly Effect', but to have BOTH these ideas meshed into one script  that is truly far too ambitious for writers of this caliber. 'Sliding Doors' handles its theme with intelligence and control  unlike 'BE' which is frantic, and manic, and so overly dramatic that it quickly becomes funny instead of suspenseful. '12 Monkeys', which was a solid movie, stumbled on logic because time-travel plots rarely work because of the inherent traps they entail due to the (scientific) complexity of the idea..The way the destinies of the four central characters changes with every one of Ashton's 'experiments' often makes no sense. For example, we are lead to believe that Tommy would be a raving lunatic/psychopath in the first 2-3 realities, while a totally religious do-gooder in another! The writers actually want to make us believe that the way Stoltz brings up his son will make THAT much of a difference! Excuse me, but psychopaths are born, not created  and Tommy's behaviour in the first half of the film leaves without any trace of a doubt that he IS a psychopath, and that means that Tommy cannot be a nice guy in ANY reality which Ashton creates.'BE' is overly dramatic. Everything happens with extra weight. The girl is like De Sade's Justine, always being the victim, always being attacked, ruined, whatever. The movie wants us to feel for her  FINE  but why the pathetic exaggerations? Examples: 1) she gets blown up by the dynamite: this is like a scene out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon! I.e. funny because Ashton does his best to correct things and he just ends up blowing up people!!! (Or himself, later on  sorry, but I thought this was absolutely hilarious); 2) when Ashton visits, seeing her for the first time in 7 years, he observes her working in a diner, and what does he see??? Within seconds she manages to drop her tray, and then gets pinched in the a** by a customer! Talk about clichés! Talk about slapstick comedy! Talk about OVERLY DRAMATIZING THINGS! 3) when Ashton finds her working as a whore: I mean, fine, so she has hit rock-bottom in that particular reality/experiment, but they over-did it, what with the make-up, and her attitude and everything. Why the OVER-DRAMATIZATION? It would have been enough to show her as a prostitute; there was no need to make her look as the most MISERABLE PROSTITUTE IN THE WORLD! Other silly things in the movie? Here we go: 1) when the black teacher shows Ashton's Mom the drawing he (supposedly) did; all they do is comment on the content of the drawing  no-one mentions just how ultra-talented Ashton would have to be to draw like that in primary school! 2) when Ashton meets his father for the first time, guess what happens? His father dies! Talk about drama! You see, they couldn't write a script in which his Dad gets killed on their 3rd or 4th meeting, oh no  it had to be on the very 1ST visit. Why? Because that's how real DRAMA works  at least according to the nitwits who wrote this silly script. 3) it is never explained why it takes Ashton 7 YEARS to finally visit the girl whom he is supposed to love so much; she even ASKS him this, but neither her nor the viewer get ANY answer! 4) Ashton's mother getting so sick in a later 'experiment' (the one when he blows himself up so spectacularly), and then later his mother DOESN'T get sick in another experiment when Ashton kills the girl! Wouldn't that event and her son's subsequent demise as a nut-case be enough to make her sick, too??? 5) Ashton's fat, Gothic college room-mate: now, why would they include that character? It only made the movie less serious. Either you make a serious thriller, or you make a teen romp; make up your mind.Now for the funniest moments, the ones that had me laughing very loudly indeed. The scene in which Tommy beats up somebody in the cinema is HILARIOUS. This little twerp (i.e. the young actor Jesse James(!) who plays him) just looks funny acting like an adult ultra-psychopath! Like a 12 year-old Joe Pesci! But hands-down the funniest part of the film is the entire part in the jail. There are so many over-the-top, silly things happening to Ashton in jail, so much cliché prison-movie stuff going on, that it almost seemed like something out of a ZAZ film! Hilarious! Oh, yes, and Ashton is a bad actor. Almost forgot that.Everyone in the film is over-acting, over-reacting, everything is over-dramatic. I'm sure many people thought this was a brilliant picture, but I think many of them haven't seen similarly-themed  and better  movies, so they thought 'how original!'. Original only in its silliness and absurdity. Not to mention far-fetchedness. If a circus clown could take the shape of a movie, it would be 'The Butterfly Effect'.",Null,38,79,10 January 2007
District 9," 'E.T. phone home' but far far better.
","Filmed with what at least appears to have been a fairly cheap video camera, in order to give D9 a more documentary feel - and yet injected with all these impressive CGI effects. This unique combination is primarily what sets the movie apart from the plethora of increasingly dull sci-fi films made in recent years. That, and the manic direction and D9's off-the-wall events.D9 starts off very much in a Christopher Guest mockumentary vein ('For Your Consideration', 'Waiting for Guffman' etc.), it's a sci-fi but with obvious leanings towards comedy. Not particularly funny, but definitely interesting. Johannesburg as the setting was a refreshing change.As unusual as it is, the story has a major flaw: first we are watching a sci-fi comedy, with a highly animated central character, but somewhere around the half-way mark the film starts getting increasingly serious, this inexplicable 'change-of-heart' in D9's mood being underlined by a quasi-Mid-East-sounding soundtrack doodling melodramatically in the background. So now we're suddenly expected to take this man seriously? The same character who looked as if he had escaped from a Loony Toons cartoon just 45 minutes earlier. To expect that kind of switch from the audience is asinine. But then, of course, most viewers are easily manipulated sheep.",Null,2,8,15 March 2010

","Dumb Dumb Diddle... Dumb Dumb Drivel. Knowing Bjorn, Knowing Benny, it must have been all about the Money, Money, Money. The very effeminate, almost gay Pierce Brosnan may be a true Dancing Queen (in the worst possible Baz Luhrman way), but wouldn't a woman have been better suited to that role? Voulez-Vous actually watch the vastly overrated, hideous, big-nosed Streep ravage those nice ABBA songs with her hellish voice? You do, you do, you do? Well, I Don't, I Don't, Most Definitely Don't. This must be the campiest, cheesiest, most absurd-looking movie to hit the screens (literally HIT the screens: like a high-speed 16-ton piece of turd) since... well, when was George Clooney's last movie released? If Brosnan and Streep are meant to be Fernando and Chiquitita, then I'm sorry that the lyrics to these songs don't end by having the title characters face a firing squad. ('Chiquititaaa, you'll be shot to deaaaaaaath...') A bloody end, with all the cast getting obliterated in a savage orgy of violence, might have saved this movie, giving the more intelligent viewer a sense that justice does exist in this world. Gimme! Gimme! Gimme A Gun After Midnight! Bjornbenny continued where they had left off: with that awful 'The Visitors' album. If the songs on that album were any indication, then it was clear all along that if Bennybjorn ever started doing something again, they'd do it quite badly. Even more simply put, Benny and Bjorn are two aged, bored dullards. We may have been able to forgive them for grinning like morons and dressing up like failed clowns, simply because they made great music, but their involvement with this should give ABBA fans the legal right to send them into a nice, quiet retirement home.

Climax," Shlock cinema with a 'message'. So original...
","If you decide to watch this silly nonsense, do yourself a favour and skip directly to the 50-minute mark, roughly. That's where the movie starts. No joke.The first 50 minutes are 'character development', which is fairly odd considering there is no time to develop/introduce 15-20 characters in the space of a mere movie, much less a horror flick. Suffice it to say, the first 10 minutes consist almost entirely of monotonous 'VHS' interviews with (mostly) airhead dancers, after which we get tortured with a bloody silly 5-minute musical number(!), this in turn being followed by 30 minutes of random and brief conversations between the extremely dim-witted low-life characters. This segment includes yet another utterly pointless lengthy musical number. Needless to say, I fast-forwarded that too.Then the violence erupts. Apparently, someone spiked the alcohol with LSD - although I suspect it's more likely to be the notorious 'New Extreme French Cinema' drug - and all hell breaks loose. But because this isn't an American movie, the violence is generally perpetrated by blacks, with usually whites as their victims. It's hard to say whether this was intentional though, especially because so much of the movie seems random and improvised. (At one point the camera turns upside-down, and stays that way for a long time, and I wouldn't necessarily bet that this was planned either.) If Americans or Brits had made the same movie (I know, very difficult to imagine them producing something so intrinsically French as this cuckoo-for-caca drivel), the blacks would be victims of white violence: it's pathetic how each region/country/culture has its own (hidden) political/social agenda; nobody is innocent anymore, and everyone wants to preach and teach, rarely to entertain. Bias bias bias everywhere: there is racism among racists and 'anti-racists' alike. Nevertheless, there is no obvious or at least central racial agenda or theme here, aside from one of the black dancers shouting 'you white pigs!' while severely beating a white dancer.I am convinced hipster cinemaphiles love this flick though. Aside from the fact that it tackles some of their favourite subjects such as insanity, drug use, incest, anti-social behavior, masturbation, homosexuality, weirdness, and extreme violence, it is an unusually (read: stupidly) structured film which is to their liking. It's very much fringe cinema (though nothing remotely as extreme as the depraved 70s underground cult scene), and to a hipster fringe cinema can do no wrong, just as commercial cinema can do no right. (Hipsters have strict rules which they must abide by, otherwise they risk losing credibility with their militant peers. This goes for music too, and perhaps even hats and coffee.)The plot, despite the 'elaborate' i.e. arty set-up, is very basic. It is even more primitive than some zombie movies. I specifically mention those because this essentially plays out like a zombie flick: the difference being that people aren't bitten/infected but high on drugs. The effects are very similar though: total barbarism and random violence. I guess this is why the film-maker decided on such an odd structure, because he perhaps felt that the story was so ultra-simplistic that the film required additional 'decoration', something to impress the art-crowd with. Correction: the bloody-thirsty art-crowd...Yet, this pretentious decision to over-decorate is more-or-less why the movie fails. Wasting FIFTY minutes of screen-time, i.e. more than half the movie, on superficial/dull banter involving very dull nitwits makes it impossible for me give the film a rating better than 3/10. I had to fast-forward large chunks of the movie, so it's a wonder the film gets even that much from me.Naturally, the movie has no point to make, at least not any new or intelligent point - despite what hipsters might claim. I haven't read any reviews, but they probably believe that the film makes some 'powerful statement about our inherent barbarism' or some such pretentious laughable malarkey. Although, to be fair, this is mostly true: give idiots half a chance, and they will become violent. Nevertheless, hipsters being staunchly left-wing would mean they contradict themselves and their idol Marx if they adopted the view that humans are still essentially easily manipulated savages with an intrinsically evil essence. After all, don't (millennial) hipsters foster the illusion that they are so much smarter and more evolved than older generations? Don't these 'trendy' young dancers qualify as 'evolved, hip, and smart' to hipsters? Doesn't Marx elevate humans to an almost god-like status? (No, wait, that highly optimistic 'great and sudden evolution' comes AFTER the great overthrow of evil capitalism, according to the pompous 19th-century couch philosopher...)The director tries hard to give this shock-cinema 'art-house' nonsense a stamp of intellectual credibility - through the use of cheesy quasi-intellectual captions - but whoever falls for that lame fortune-cookie 'trick' only has their own gullibility to blame. This film is just an excuse to create train-wreck situations for thrill-seeking blood-thirsty film buffs. Most of these film buffs are completely unaware of this thirst for blood in themselves, and those who are justify their interest in it by treating the quasi-intellectual captions as poignant rather than laughable, thereby allowing such movies to get away with murder - simply on the pretext that 'it's all symbolism anyway'.Yeah, sure it is.",Null,0,3,29 November 2019

Tucker and Dale vs Evil," The title is daft.
","Amongst the recent spate of horror comedies, this one is a cut above most, including the overrated crap such as 'Zombieland' and 'Shaun of the Dead', though not quite as good as the Cuban-Spanish 'Juan of the Dead'. Unlike 'proper' comedies, such as any Sascha Baron Cohen or Monty Python film (i.e. generally referring to UK comedies), which are funny/comedic from start to finish, TADVE falls more into the formulaic/commercial U.S. category, despite its original premise. What I mean is that the first half is quite funny, while the second half sees a marked drop in gag quality, with too much repetition, the inclusion of very obvious cliché gags, TADVE even becoming slightly sentimental on occasion (which is why this isn't a 'proper' i.e. all-out comedy, which is how all comedies should be made).It was obvious early on that the movie's rather shaky premise would run into trouble eventually. Don't get me wrong - the premise is great, but it relies too much on comedy-of-errors humour. There are only so many accidental situations and coincidences you can utilize as plot-devices until the well simply dries up and the same absurd shtick isn't as funny anymore. The law of diminishing returns applies here.I am not quite sure why anybody would include a spoiler in the movie's title! 'Vs. Evil' is a bloody giveaway. Sure, it gets people flocking to see the movie (the dumber viewers, who need everything spelled out in the title), but the surprise factor is out the window. Not everybody watches trailers and reads the story lines in advance. I am quite annoyed with the movie's title, as it gives no-one (apart from morons: those lucky avatards!) the slightest chance of being surprised by the role-reversal premise.Best moment: 'Don't you know those things (mobile phones) won't work here?!' 8/10 for the first, 5/10 for the second half.",Null,2,8,10 January 2013
28 Days Later...," Trust Danny Boyle to get confused even by something as simple and straight-forward as the zombie sub-genre...
","28DL starts off much like 'The Quiet Earth' and 'The World The Flesh & The Devil', soon switching into 'The Dawn of the Dead' mode, only to totally disappoint by going into retarded 'Day of the Dead' territory. The bad bad evil evil military (all 8 of them) turn out to be a bigger threat than the zombies themselves - an idiotic premise already served to us 20 years earlier by the perpetually un-intellectual drivel-making liberal nincompoop, George Romero. I've said this before and I'll say it again (and again): whoever (mis)uses the zombie genre to make 'clever' political commentary needs to have their head examined. There is a time and place for everything, hence screaming, brainless, undead morons (am referring to the zombies, not Hollywood's horror directors) do not a proper background for social satire make.The problem with the third part of the movie (the army part) is that zombies are completely pushed aside. Boyle, in his infinite and typical lack of wisdom, switches off the by-then seemingly limitless supply of zombies, turning 28DL into a mere cheap exploitation thriller with effeminate post-apocalyptic Cillian saving damsels in distress from an almost certain destiny of getting raped by a bunch of horny soldiers. I sort of half-assumed they'd rape Cillian first, what with his unusually high estrogen levels. Let's face it, even those two girls look less female than he does. When will this current trend of casting hermaphroditic 'males' as screen heroes finally end? How many more Di Caprios does the movie world need? Who has stolen all of the testosterone from the modern male? Thrillers are by far the dumbest genre: far-fetched plots, plenty of illogicality, poor and often contradictory character development, etc... The worst aspect of Boyle's version of 'Day of the Dead' was Bambi-like Cillian becoming Rambo - killing off the scared, incompetent little soldiers as if they were a bunch of kids and amateurs. Remember: Cillian started off as a skinny nerd, recovering from both the injuries that brought him to the hospital in the first place, and the disorientation caused by the world he found after he woke up. Plus, also remember: these soldiers were not only trained for combat, but they belonged to a small number who actually managed to survive the virus. So obviously musculary-challenged, X-legged Cillian bumps them all off as if they were mere flies in his soup...Baby-faced Cillian strips off his shirt like a WWF wrestler and proceeds to stalk, kill and destroy enemy targets like a computer-game soldier in heat. That was the point at which I had to start laughing. I always appreciate a good comedy, but something tells me that Boyle's tiny mind had different intentions...Apparently, it doesn't take (British) soldiers long (several weeks?) to become stark raving sex maniacs, hell-bent on killing off males and screwing females. Boyle's understanding of human psychology is catastrophic - mildly put. But what else can one expect from a director who in all honesty and wide-eyed naive enthusiasm promoted 'Sunshine' as a serious sci-fi film? Boyle can barely handle i.e. understand zombie psychology, let alone human.Politically correct - hence stupid - ending with the two females being the sole survivors. Who would have 'thunk' it?! So predictable...What's with that post-end-credits final twist? Was Boyle trying to start a new trend? 'Watch the WHOLE movie, if you wanna see the REAL ending'. What a boyle on my movie bum Danny's turned out to be post-'Trainspotting'...I love the way the girl's father gets killed: that drop of blood falling from a dried up zombie should get an Oscar.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Yet another dumb block-buster from Spielberg.
","Provides little new, but the special effects remain entertaining. Degenerates into B-movie nonsense towards the end. The scene with the black girl doing a bit of gymnastics to knock out a dinosaur is one of the stupidest scenes I've seen in years. The humour appears forced. Spielberg is repeating himself, just as he has been doing in many of his other films. Again, the special-effects people have done their part well, while Spielberg shows incompetence in making a movie around all these great special effects.Spielberg's late 80s and 90s movies have alternated between profit-oriented cash-cows and 'serious' dramas. Either he is making another commercial cash-monster, or he is attempting to make another (PC) drama that will win him Oscars. He finally succeeded with 'Schindler's List', which touches on a sure-fire topic that he knew would get him truck-loads of Oscars. Hollywood is Jewish, and any movie, documentary, or short film - bad or good - that deals with Jews in WWII always gets an Oscar. I haven't seen 'Schindler's List' and I am unlikely to ever see it; firstly, I generally boycott Spielberg's terrible dramas (which always seem to have the worst casts imaginable), and, secondly, I think that one gets a far better impression of what sort of a hell concentration camps must have been from the numerous hard-hitting and immensely depressing documentaries made on the subject. I've seen some of those documentaries and am absolutely convinced that Spielberg's overly-polished and superficial style can never even get close to that kind of realism.I welcome any director's attempts to bring the holocaust to the attention of a historically-challenged and ignorant American public, but I doubt that Spielberg's motives were entirely noble. He made this film-project look like some kind of a personal crusade to remind the world of the suffering of Jews in WWII, but the crusade was more about winning recognition from Hollywood and its dumb Oscar-voters than anything else. Who really needed 'Schindler's List' most? Spielberg. And to prove that his search for critical recognition takes over any other interests when making a movie one need only look at the two 'serious' films he made after 'Schindler's List': 'Amistad' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. 'Amistad' was supposed to be for American blacks what 'Schindler's List' was for Jews, and hence garner him the same kind of Oscar recognition. However, this blatantly politically-correct film must have turned out to be so bad that even the ultra-PC Hollywood decided not to 'honour' Spielberg for it. (I believe it 'only' got one Oscar: what a disappointment for Spielberg.) And I mean it must be a really awful film; after all, even the terrible 'Gandhi' wasn't awful enough to prevent it receiving tons of Oscars. 'Saving Private Ryan', with its uniquely bad cast of actors who look as out of place in WWII as Sean Connery in an gay indie movie, is another very obvious and cynical attempt by Spielberg to get more Oscars: American men fighting for America's freedom, in a three-hour spectacle. This time Spielberg's true-and-tried tactic worked. How could Hollywood say no? His interviews, his behaviour, and the statements that he made, all clearly show that awards mean more to him than anything else on this planet. He is a recognition-seeker; a true megalomaniac who lacks the 'modesty' to be known 'only' as a popular director; he wants unanimous critical recognition, too, and will do anything to get it. He also seems to lack the intellect to realize that awards don't prove at all that your movie is better than the others. When he receives an award Spielberg glows with joy. Obviously, everyone is happy when they win an Oscar, Golden Globe, New York's Critics Award (etc.), but Spielberg puts truly ridiculous significance on it. To prove my point, this man was actually deeply disappointed(!) that he 'lost' to 'Shakespeare in Love' (another dumb movie, by the way). Nevermind that Spielberg won the Best Director Oscar - this wasn't enough for him. He wanted it ALL! The man is pathetic. The after-Oscar party of 'DreamWorks' was reported to have been covered in a cloud of misery! The man is an idiot.Politically speaking, what makes Spielberg even more easy to hate are his obvious and predictable leanings to the Left. This man - this Hollywood hypocrite - who claims to champion the Jewish cause supports Clinton. Clinton's Middle East policy is clearly anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian. (And the less said about his bitch wife, the better.) Yet this dumb, self-absorbed Hollywood Jew supports this hillbilly Arkansas moron. Like most American Jews, Spielberg shows a very disappointing lack of support for his Jewish 'brothers' in Israel. I can imagine how frustrated and even angry most Israelis must get when they just think of Hollywood Jews; only a few of the latter seem to truly understand Israel and even fewer show loyalty to it. (An example: Hillary openly supports and visits Arafat, whom she considers a friend(!), yet advance polls showed that most Jews would still vote for her if she ran for a New York senate seat!) Spielberg stands as a symbol for the worst kind of American Jew: a left-leaning Hollywood hypocrite, who plays the role of a do-gooder, but whose sole interests in life are power and money. And recognition. The question isn't whether he is a hypocrite/scumbag or just an ignorant moron. He is both. And his latest film, 'Munich', proves more than ever that he is as anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic as Hamas. A little exaggeration, perhaps, but only a little one.",Null,8,31,5 January 2007
The Number 23," At least an attempt was made at something original.
","Forget 23. 14 is the number we should all wonder about:1. Tim Robbins's I.Q. is - allegedly - 14.2. Sean Penn's I.Q. is - allegedly - 41. 3. The average number of brain cells of viewers who vote like those two is 1414. 4. 'Mystic River', a movie which features both Penn and Robbins, was released in 2003. (I said forget 23!) 2+3 = 5. 5 = 1+4. 5. The number of lines of cocaine Penn and Robbins each sniff in on an average weekend (when they should be learning to read and write instead): 7. 2x7 = 14Considering Schumacher made it, the movie is quite solid, not bad at all. Interesting, though not gripping, original enough, and visually good.Of course, there are some (logic) problems: why does the shrink react so melodramatically and slash his own neck - immediately - upon seeing Carrey? That's a pretty drastic reaction even for a shrink-turned-loon. Why all the nonsense scenes with the all-present dog? If the movie wanted to be supernatural it should have gone that route instead of the thriller route.I was a little disappointed the movie became a thriller. At least there were no cops and serial killers, but must every movie have a murder case at its core? Is that all that happens among humans that is relevant/interesting? But the biggest problem is how Madsen found the book. The script-writer obviously noticed this flaw (probably very late), so he tried to neutralize it by having Carrey say that 'the book found HER'. That doesn't exactly help, and it's utterly insufficient. Again: the movie did not take the supernatural route hence this kind of destiny nonsense simply won't wash. And besides, didn't Carrey say at the very end that 'there is no such things as destiny'? The odds of Madsen finding Carrey's book - which must have been published with only 5 copies or something - and then giving it to him for his birthday are almost as small as that of Susan Sarandon accidentally writing a Shakespeare play even if we give her an eternity to do it and a million typewriters (and a billion monkeys to help out).",Null,1,5,17 September 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Spielberg's version would have been... unbearable...
","As in the new Star Wars trilogy, I have to say: thank God no high-profile a****** actors were hired to ruin this for me. The newcomers to the trilogy vary from good to terrific; importantly, Miranda Otto is attractive if a bit flat-chested (but, okay, this isn't an erotic thriller), and Karl Urban is the stand-out in TT. This time Wood has more interesting scenes as Frodo, and as a result he gets to show more. McKellen doesn't appear much, but when he does he dominates, like in 'FOTR'. Mortenssen also shows a slight improvement. Only Tyler, our three-meter MTV airhead adds nothing to the movie. In the 'TT' book she doesn't even appear at all, but Jackson wanted to make that extra $100 million dollars from the female movie-goers so he had some pointless romantic scenes thrown in which probably have Tolkien - if not spinning - than at least shaking his head in his grave. In fact, the non-book, added 'Hollywood scenes' are in contrast to the rest of the movie: the dialog is weaker, the tension isn't there, etc. But these 5-10 minutes objectively constitute the sole drawback in an otherwise near-perfect movie. And to be fair - they aren't exactly dull or bad.Let's not forget that had Spielberg done the trilogy there would have been incomparably more tampering with the original text, and the sentimentality and pathos would be oozing out of every pore of the movie. Spielberg the Movie Mo-Ghoul played with the idea of filming the trilogy and it gives me great satisfaction to know that he was none too happy when Jackson showed interest in it and started making the first preparations. Not to mention that Jackson actually got off his a** and actually DID this monumental saga. Spielberg was seething with jealousy. I could sense it across the ocean. There is something in the transatlantic breeze that smells of Spielberg's fuming.In fact, this is how the trilogy would have been had Spielberg the Uncrowned God of Hollywood done it: 1) cast: Tom Hanks as Aragorn * Tom Cruise as Borimir * Macauley Culkin as Frodo * Culkin's fat brother (Keeran?) as Samwise * Laura Dern (with black hair) as Arwen * Denzel Washington as Gandalf (a nice PC touch, having a black man be the wisest of them all) * Paul Newman as Saruman * Kiefer Sutherland as Wormtongue * two Asian kids as Mary and Pippen (probably two of Spielberg's own adopted brood) * Danny de Vito as Gimli (without the make-up, and even more wise-cracking) * Di Crapio as an ultra feminine-looking Legolas * Laura Dern (playing two roles) as a Galadria one would want to vomit on * Christian Slater as a Faramir who can't say his 's' properly * Warren Beatty, looking as dumb as ever, as Theoden * John Travolta as a highly animated Lord Denethor * Drew Barrymore as Eowyn * Ashton Kutcher as Eomer. Gollum would probably be animated so as to be cute, cuddly and with big, wide Pocahontas eyes, plus a girl's voice (probably Winona Ryder's) and all evil would have been scripted out of him. Treebeard would look very little like a true; it would be Robin Williams with two vaguely treeish legs dangling at the bottom. He wouldn't talk slow, like all Ents, but quickly with plenty of one-liners.There would be none of that wonderful dark-blue/green look; even Saruman's tower would be pink/red and with flowers surrounding it instead of trees. The Ents wouldn't have deep voices but would sound like a bunch of old women (like Python's pepper-pots); the ecological message would have been so exaggerated that the Ents would be shown in a brief sequence holding anti-Exxon, anti-globalism, anti-pollution banners in front of Saruman's Isengard. (Saruman would then come out on the terrace and tell the Ents that he refuses to sign the Kyoto Treaty.) Galadria would have a half-hobbit half-sister sidekick, played by Cameron Diaz, and Frodo would fall in love with her and suffer deeply when she gets captured by Orcs (in Peter Greenaway's version the Orcs would torture her, rape her, then kill her and eat her, while reciting Japanese poetry). Tom Bombadil would have been not only included in the movie but turned into a main character, singing Elton John and Phil Collins soundtrack songs while spreading thinly disguised pacifism and left-wing ideology; needless to say, he'd be played by Collins or John. One of the main characters would be homosexual. How about Boromir? No, Boromir is a bit susceptible to evil and as we all know all homosexuals are nice people and not at all the type to try to steal the Ring of Power from Frodo. Aragorn? No, for he loves Arwen and we can't have him kissing Faramir because the gay community would be offended by a 'bisexual' gay. Bilbo, perhaps, as the childless uncle of Frodo? Right. Bilbo would have an elvish boyfriend in Edoras, which would hit two flies with one stroke: this would act both as support for gays and for interracial relationships. In fact, it would even be hinted that Bilbo had a brief romance with Elrond (in his 'Hobbit' period) and that Arwen even encourages her father to renew his old affair with Bilbo, now that Bilbo's come back. (There would be a touching scene in which Arwen comforts her sobbing father to forgive Bilbo for breaking his heart 50 years earlier.) But for Spielberg, two love affairs wouldn't be enough; the hobbits must also have their love-interests. Merry would fall in love with a female Orc (signifying that no species/race is so evil that it is beyond redemption), named Orcana, who would aid the Fellowship in their adventures. Orcana's female cousin - Urukhaia - would fall in love with Pippen, etc.",Null,3,6,6 August 2007
The Mist," 'This pathetic attempt at a joke has gone far enough'. I totally agree with the black lawyer.
","Stephen King is the Ed Wood of the Modern Movie Age.In German 'Mist' means 's**t', and who are we to argue about the prophetic nature of Germanic languages? This pile of Stephenkingsian crap is yet another amalgamation of ultra-clichés that we've seen about 1000 movies, except that it actually manages to be a notch dumber than even the most cretinous 50s B-movies. I take it back: Stephen King is not the Ed Wood of anything - for that would be insulting even to Ed Wood's 'talents'. Rather, he is the Paris Hilton of the horror genre: deluded, dirt-dumb, perpetually grinning, and adored for all the wrong reasons (non-reasons), i.e. a major cult figure in an age of rising stupidity. Forget Eco or Asimov: it's only King's moronic scribbles that the riff-raff can truly appreciate.SK doesn't even try anymore, if he even ever tried at all: he's been repeating himself for decades, but almost no-one seems to care. His novels/movies are like pop music: God forbid there should be a hint of originality in there somewhere, occasionally: his fanatically devoted, low-IQ fans would run away from him like the plague if that were ever to happen. TM doesn't omit any clichés: a small town being besieged by monsters, an unconvincing over-the-top religious nut, the survivors bickering over nothing, large insects, silly large spiders, the bad bad military experiments, etc. What's worse, this laughable malarkey-feast lasts a good two hours - which is about 90 minutes too long considering how unoriginal, retarded and thin its story-line is. Time is being wasted on totally irrelevant, dull scenes which SK probably throws into the 'character development' category. The problem is that King's grasp of human behaviour is child-like at best... There is more character development in a bird-dropping.At first, no-one wants to leave the store, not even to help a woman find her kid. (At the end we find out that she survived. No explanation whatsoever is given as to how she might have achieved this impossible feat: it goes against all logic - the 'logic' that King himself established in this confused mess of a movie.) Yet, only a while later, a sizeable group of people are raring to go outside. Idiotic. This illogical group is lead by a black lawyer who refuses to believe the story of Squidy's attack. We all know what (defense) lawyers are, but they're not imbeciles; at least not as dumb as Stephen King himself. (Particularly hard to achieve.) So what does our 'bright' hero, Thomas Jane, do to convince the lawyer? He does not show him the bloodied shirt. He does not tell him that a young man was dragged off and killed by Squidy. He just says 'you must believe me'. Idiotic.The sole purpose of King's characters bickering retardedly is just so King can have his precious 'conflict': that magic word in movie la-la-land. Conflict at any price. Conflict that will make you laugh out loud.Ed Wood's hilariously inept plea for acceptance of transvestitism is peanuts compared to King's sorry attempts to pepper-up his horror stories with 'relevant social/political messages'. This dumb little monster movie makes mention of abortion, stem-cell research, education funding (King the Education Expert), military spending (King the Foreign Policy Maestro), and even Fidel Castro! (No doubt a friend of King's.) It's a major movie disease in recent years (only second to nepotism): no genre seems to be safe anymore from the simplistic preachings of semi-educated 'know-it-alls' who don't realize their infantile (mis)understanding of the world's problems don't amount to a hill of beans. Besides, Steve, if you're gonna preach, then don't sandwich your idiotic/twisted morality and Leftist political messages between Squidy the Large Man-Killer and mosquitoes that suck blood: it just makes you look even more foolish...Oh yeah, Steve, you forgot to mention gay rights, flag-burning, welfare reform, and health care funding. But I guess we'll have to seek Stephen's brilliant opinions on these issues in his other books/movies. What a shame... I was so looking forward to learning everything there was to know about the political and social climate of today's America, from an intellectual of King's calibre. What a mind, what class.What an ending! I disagree with the pervading view that it's depressing: I think it's HILARIOUS. King writes about people as if he's only joined the human race yesterday, from planet Gamma X Retard.What nonsense: 1) After the soldier gets stabbed THREE times with a large kitchen knife - in the belly - he is then thrown out of the store, but instead of falling to the ground he walks around as if he'd been scratched by a nail-polisher! 2) There is a burn victim (the way he gets burnt is an unintentionally comedic highlight in itself), but there are no pain-killers at all in this entire store, just aspirin. However, the store has enough dog-food to feed half of Brazil... 3) People are extremely frightened of the 'mist' from the very start, and in normal circumstances half of America's population believes in alien abductions and Sasqwatch - and yet(i) everyone is suddenly skeptical that Squidy really can exist! 4) The speed with which the survivors are ready to accept Harden as Christ's prophet is ludicrous: yet more evidence of King's laughable lack of understanding of humans and society. (He must have obtained all his 'rich world knowledge' from watching 'Oprah' and Bugs Bunny cartoons.) I loved it when King spoke through the old lady: 'too many bombs, too little spent on education', she says early on. Is Stephen referring to the kind of 'education' his cretinous books and movies serve in enriching and improving America's peanut-butter culture?",Null,12,24,12 March 2009
I Am Legend," Could have been worse. Could have been 'Ali'.
","The worst thing about this dumb movie is not that it has CGI deer.Or that the zombies have superpowers.Or that a washed-out, formerly great director made IAL just to make yet more money with mass-appeal garbage.Or that the main character talks about Bob Marley in a moment of predictable Hollywood PC-ness.Or that it's much worse than both 'The Omega Man' and 'Last Man On Earth', hence a pointless remake.Or that it portrays scientists as a root of all evil.Or that it presents religion as something a person should cling to when faced with hordes of unconvincing CGI zombies.Or that the zombies are described as dumb, and yet they seem rather organized and cunning, in part.Or that there is a reference to another piece of crap, 'Shreck'.Or that the conversations with the mannequin are idiotic and dull.Nor is the biggest problem that the mannequin acts better than Will Smith.The worst thing about this movie is THAT WILL SMITH IS IN IT.'I Am Legend'ary in making crap movies.Is the air in this movie CGI-made, too?

Moulin Rouge!," A dull musical with some truly bad music.
","Visually impressive - though unfortunately over reliant on red - musical that seems to drift in a Netherworld between very broad comedy and romantic drama. Too long, and quite full of dull dialogues with most supporting characters overacting their asses off. The musical numbers are mostly forgettable, occasionally even awful - like the rape of 'Roxanne', the idiotic version of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', the dried up and never-has-been-good, tedious 'Madame Chocolat' (or whatever the hell it's called), and the utterly hopeless choice of one or two Madonna(!) songs. Talk about bad taste. Another musical problem is Nicole Kidman's voice, which is clearly quite inferior to McGregor's surprisingly solid voice; she doesn't so much sing as she whispers - a true mark of someone with a weak voice. The 'whisper cop-out' is often used by women who try to disguise the fact that their voice doesn't measure up. This never becomes more obvious than when the two leads sing together; she simply pales by comparison. Also, the two have been mismatched: 1) she is older than him, 2) he is charismatic, she isn't, and 3) most importantly, she is a head taller. McGregor is charismatic, but he can't help this movie much. And how's that last 'message' we get at the very end of the end-credits: 'truth', 'beauty', and 'above all... love'. How profound and how friggin' touching'. Come on everybody, let's all sing bad 80s/90s hits (or 80s/90s hits covered badly) and pull out our handkerchiefs and whimper a lot. Still, it could be worse: it could be 'Chicago'.",Null,7,13,4 January 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Should excite many nerds and kids.
","So basically Reed is like the Dad in 'The Brady Bunch', wholesome and cheerful, while Ben is... the Hulk? (I hope this doesn't upset the comic-book geeks.) A fairly entertaining film; nice visually, not dull, and with two stunners in Jessica Alba and Beau Garrett. (As opposed to two dogs like Aniston and Diaz.) It's just comic-book nonsense so there's no point in nit-picking too much over the logic/plot, but I do want to point out that even a dumb Marvel comic-book (sorry... 'graphic novel') cannot or should not have an army general as dumb as this one, and a villain with an even lower I.Q. than the general. The general is played by a black guy, 'so whassup with that'? I.e. shouldn't the PC police raise a stink that the only strong black male lead here is dumb as dirt? As for the villain, why would he not give up the board to save Earth hence himself? Duh.The reason the Silver Surfer didn't get his own movie isn't because his inter-planetary address keeps changing so he couldn't be reached, but because the film studio (and perhaps Stan Lee, as well) were nervous about whether that character could work on the big screen without being merely laughable. And they have a right to be: in the comic-book the SS is a philosophizing alien destroying billions of creatures/people. And that's why his role here is strictly that of a bland, silent alien. He has perhaps 10-15 lines in the entire movie.It's amazing that even in a supposedly harmless little comic-book picture like 'F4' does Tinseltown's decadent Leftist elite have to throw in little political/social commentary - quite 'well disguised' - of course - and 'totally unobtrusive'. Examples? Example 1: 'We are now officially the enemy of the United States.' A nod to the Iraq War, i.e. anti-war Hollywood whine-bitching. Translation: 'An enemy of the States are probably the good guys.'Example 2: 'Who says you need to be normal to have a family?' A friendly little pink wink to gay rights, i.e. the rights of homosexuals to adopt kids. Unalienable rights, of course: indisputable and unchallengeable rights. After all, Hollywood ALWAYS knows what's best for society, civilization and the universe. Kind of like Galactus.",Null,1,3,15 September 2007
Wimbledon," CGI tennis is exactly what the world needed.
","I know it's just a dumb, predictable, formulaic romantic comedy, but I feel the urge to nitpick at the tennis aspects nevertheless: 1. The extremely nerd-looking, X-legged Bettany wins the match in the 3rd round and then plays... in the quarterfinals! Whatever happened to the 4th round? Did he get a bye for being English? There is a 128-person draw in every Grand Slam tournament, not a 64 one, hence seven matches to play. Is it too much to ask to have the barest minimum of realism in a Hollywood movie?...2. Bettany plays his semi-finale match on some crappy side-court. This NEVER happens, not even when it rains for days - especially not when a local player is in the semis! 3. The men's semi-finale match was played around the same time as Dunst's semi-finale. This also cannot happen - unless it rains for days. Yet there was no rain.4. After Bettany predictably wins his semi-finale match, he goes to the locker room and finds a dozen male tennis pros there. What exactly are they all doing there at such a late stage in the tournament? After all, it's not the 1st round anymore. Apart from the singles, there are only the men's doubles and the odd guy playing mixed. Bettany should have found himself almost alone in the changing room, or at the most surrounded by agents, masseurs and organizers, not other players.5. Dunst supposedly plays her first Wimbledon. That would make her 16 or 17. Dunst cannot pass off as that young. I can't remember the last time a female player debuted as late as this 20+ Dunst they gave us. Or are they implying she's 17? That would make her underage, putting Bettany in a bit of a spot. All top female talents play their first slams as early as when they're 16 or 17, some even earlier. There is no such thing as a super-talented U.S. gal reaching the semifinales on her first try - at the age of 20+.6. CGI rallies do not in any way reflect what actually happens on a real tennis court. The second match point in the finale is like a CGI Star Wars version of tennis: utterly laughable. Yet another point, in the same match, was supposed to have a successful lob, but the ball wasn't high enough to lob a midget in a wheelchair, let alone a 6-foot pro; nevertheless, Bettany just apathetically watches it fly by him, doing nothing to smash it into the opponent's half. I understand the need to make the film exciting, but creating cyber-space-like tennis rallies is not the way to go - unless you think that only morons watch your movies.7. Any pro veteran who needs a teenage Lolita to give him tips on how to attack/read a player's serve has to be an idiot.And, finally...8. LOVE does not win you grand slam finales.9. Google 'vjetropev 100 prettiest'.Halfway through this mediocre turkey I was thinking: 'it can't be THAT cheesy... he's not actually going to win the title...?' But yes: the movie IS that predictable - and that corny. The washed up 30something player, whom everyone forgot about, falls in lurve with a U.S. Lolita, and this inspires him to go all the way.Sam Neill's U.S. accent is in shambles.There is not enough chemistry between Dunst and Bettany. Tommy Haas, who was mentioned at one point, should have been cast. He is far better-looking than Bettany and they wouldn't have needed to cover up for Bettany's crappy technique by CGI-ing all of his shots. Plus: anyone can act.",Null,0,4,16 February 2008
Pi," If you're an MTV airhead, stay away.
","This fascinating low-budget movie is about - well - the meaning of life in a sense. The main character, Max, is a semi-mad loner, a mathematic genius whose life's obsession is to sort out the chaos that is the universe in a coherent mathematical, that is to say, numerical - to him understandable - fashion. He doesn't have sex and he doesn't socialize; in fact, any contact with humans other than the old man - mentor? - is merely a waste of time and a triviality he would very well gladly do without entirely. The friendly chatter which his attractive Indian neighbour tries to repeatedly initiate falls on deaf ears. The little Asian girl that tests his computing skills he only affably tolerates possibly because she talks numbers with him and not so much because she is an innocent child.The first thing he informs us is that he's had headaches ever since regaining his sight after having briefly lost it at the age of six when he starred directly at the sun in spite of being warned not to by his mother. It is to be assumed that from that point onwards his mind, his life, was focused on only one thing: to figure it all out. He later adds that he recalls as he starred at the sun that he saw a pattern or something, that what he saw made sense in a way and that he wanted to understand it better - whatever 'it' was. The headaches are to be interpreted as the result of his (growing) frustration in failing to get to 'the answer' i.e. the number or pattern. His obsession and the resulting thousands of hours of work and energy that he has invested in exploring the world of numbers - particularly as they relate to the 'pi' value and spirals - has turned him into a mental mess. He consumes huge amounts of medication to fight the migraine, the shakes and God knows what else. His single-mindedness and rigid focus on finding the truth of all truths is increasingly bringing him to the very verge of total insanity.His dogmatic refusal to accept the world as a place of chaos which neither he nor anyone else can fully or even partially control lead him to the idea that there is an inherent order in the universe and that it - like absolutely everything else - is based on clean and understandable numerical laws and principles. It isn't a coincidence that it was a look at the Sun that triggered this in him; the Sun is round after all, the symbol of life (on Earth, at least) and the 'pi' value - which is something mathematicians have been working on for centuries - is related to the computation of a circle. He refuses to accept the existence of a world in which there is no order - however blurry and elusive that order may be. He believes that he will get to that number - which he finds out consists of a sequence of 216 numbers - best by analyzing the world stock markets, and later even the numerical significance of texts in the Torah. And as he gets closer to the truth/the number/the pattern i.e. to giving order a name, or a numerical value to the (non)chaos, ironically his own life gets increasingly chaotic: he suffers illusions, the old man gets a stroke, the fanatical Jewish organization is after him, the stock-broker firm is after him, the attacks get worse, etc. In the subway-station hallucination he sees a brain and he instinctively wants to poke it with a pen; this is perhaps subject to free interpretation, but I believe that this is his sub-conscious wish to lobotomize himself, i.e. free himself from the miserable, manic, and uncomfortable existence which has been torturing his mind (and body) for so long. There is an implied, certain amount of self-hate in him; he hates the (dominant) part of him which seeks this number. His old friend, it seems, knows more about Max's quest than he'd admit, because he was there once, too. He warns Max about continuing his search; he tells him that it's both futile and leads to self-destruction. But self-destruction or at least the sort-of lobotomical self-destruction is perhaps what Max wants. He seeks the answer so that he can finally rest.The old man eventually (apparently) finds the (series of) number(s) and dies(?) from a second stroke. Max takes the paper with the figures and goes completely mad. In one of the final scenes he undergoes an almost religious experience in which he, well, sees the light - literally. This is entirely free for interpretation. A religious person will say that he has seen God, whereas an atheist like myself will say that he underwent something remotely comparable to what Dave undergoes in the last half-hour of '2001'; i.e. that he has gotten insight into the secret(s) of the universe, that he has finally learned how the chaos is controlled - or not controlled as may be the case. In the end, he performs a quasi lobotomy on himself, rather unsubtly with a drill. Again, why he does this may or may not be obvious. I believe that he found the truth and that it was so overwhelming - in a positive or negative way (or maybe even both) - that he, as a mere human, couldn't handle it. So he took his genius, and perhaps this knowledge away from him with the drill. The last scene in the park shows the Asian girl asking him her usual mathematical questions. Max says he doesn't know the answer to the first one. The second is to divide 748 by 238. He doesn't say anything, but merely looks up at the sky (or Sun). Of course, the answer to this is 3.14...",Null,7,11,11 February 2007
Children of Men," 'V For Vendetta: The Prequel'. Strictly for the reality-challenged.
","'It is the year 2006 (not 2027), and the dumbing down process is nearly complete. Moronic children of moronic men have gathered to make the ultimate left-wing propaganda film masked as a futuristic thriller. The masses loved it; they are brainwashed sheep, their average IQ having sunk considerably in recent generations..' This might as well have been titled 'V For Vendetta 2'; the same kind of thinly-veiled pro-terrorist message, a Far-Right Britain of the future, and some truly bad acting.The question isn't why everyone has become sterile (except the animals - why??) but who has produced the lovely low-IQ individuals who created this mess. Wasn't this the director who did 'Harry Potter 3'? (I saw interviews with the man on that DVD; he seems very wide-eyed, very silly, and not too bright.) The terrorists are the good guys. The Iraq war was a mistake. The government hates you. It lies every time. And fundamentalist Islam is harmless. So what else is new from Marxists who side with other extremists while opposing the much-hated Capitalist West (that gave them the opportunity to make this crap in the first place)? And just like 'V For Vomit', this propagandist left-wing trash saddles this supposed 'future' with so many present-day issues that it made me wonder: why bother pretending this is about the future? Why not just set it in 2006 and spell it out loud and clear: WE HATE America, CAPITALISM & GLOBALISM. VOTE LEFT. That should be the movie's marketing punchline. However, marketing in its essence is dishonest, and directors always prefer to send out their political messages sneakily.The world today has a major problem with over-population, yet this 'reality-based', 'serious' futuristic thriller drama wants us to buy the extremely far-fetched, cockamamie premise about mass sterility - and EVERYONE has got it! (Well, except the joke-spewing black girl...) Has some mysterious gas entered all of femalekind's genitals, chocking all the eggs - while cleverly avoiding damaging the genitals of the world of fauna?... A THINKING gas: a Cuaron gas. (Or maybe someone just f****d very hard...)I laughed during the very first scene, and then wondered if this wasn't a comedy after all. The bit about the youngest man on Earth getting killed because he refused to sign an autograph had something distinctly pythonesque about it: a bleak future, dark colors - and then this nonsense on the news! Very funny, indeed. I laughed on other occasions, too; especially hilarious were the various looters, rock-throwers and the like. They were filmed with such UNauthenticity. There was an old, imprisoned woman talking in Serbo-Croatian, which was also very funny, and only seconds later an old woman complained in German about being 'placed to stand next to a n**ger'. Awful. Also very funny were Owen and the two women running away from the terrorists; so unconvincing... Plus the cretinous dialog, which permeates the entire movie, offers several amusing moments. The idiotic sterility premise would have been a good basis for an 'Idiocracy'-type comedy, but THIS?? Give me a break. COM is somewhat influenced by 'Brazil'. However, that movie is a dark comedy, which is a far more effective approach.'Morons Of Men' was based on a novel. Let me guess: 'The Independent', 'The Guardian', 'Liberation', 'Berliner Zeitung', and other Leftist dailies gave it rave reviews. Right? No: left.The entire movie is loaded with paranoid cliché nonsense: 'the government did this, the government does that', etc. The movie reeks of cretinous conspiracy theories, much in the 'they are hiding a UFO', 'Bush is Al-Qaida's friend', or 'masons are controlling the world' vein. Food for the gullible and the illiterate. The people who conceived this dull, inept and unintentionally funny political drama are counting on the anti-Iraq-war, anti-globalism sentiments propagated in the media - especially by the likes of the BBC. Hence to portray the BBC as a tool of a Right-wing government is laughable (wouldn't even work in a spoof). Maybe in 1000 years, but certainly not in the near future - mass sterility or not.Besides, if anything then Britain is more likely to become Marxist in several decades, rather than Right-wing, what with the leftist media's very successful brainwashing of most Europeans and half of America. In other words, if you're looking for extreme scenarios in the year 2027, then this one is far more likely: a Leftist tyranny fighting the problem of OVER-population (and not the other way around).However, all is not bleak in the world of COM: Julianne 'Ping-Pong' Moore gets killed off after only 30 minutes. I was overjoyed by this twist, because I was afraid I might have to watch her for the duration. Miscasting her as a leftist guerrilla leader in COM is even worse than her playing a porn bimbo in 'Boogie Nights'. And some serious leader she is! While driving with Owen and the pregnant girl she plays a silly game using a ping-pong ball, instead of looking out for danger, which evidently lurks at every corner in this ill-conceived world. If only Bin Laden were this incompetent and childish... (Maybe he is! Maybe we should give him ping-pong balls to play with as a distraction. It worked with Moore...)A long-haired Michael Caine, who embarrasses himself here like never before, often said that he'd do almost any movie for a substantial amount of cash. COM is a perfect example of this approach. After old fogies like Connery and Hopkins got silly long grey wigs to wear, why did they have to make Caine look stupid that way, too?If a movie like COM is liked by most people, then perhaps mankind truly deserves to become sterile by 2027 - or much earlier...",Null,9,16,18 March 2008
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Nepotistic talentlessness preaching to us about international affairs?
","Yet another in a long line of 'Loony Toon Clooney' liberal propaganda films badly disguised as 'thrillers'.First of all, McCarthy didn't hunt for 'witches', but Communists. The analogy is one of the most idiotic ever made by the Left (and God knows they've made a few!). Witches don't exist, Communists do. And if nepotistic Clooney had actually studied the historical documents related to 'the 50s Witch Hunt', he would have found that those Soviet agents McCarthy was looking for did in fact exist.Secondly, McCarthy's impact was almost minimal. After all, had he cleaned Hollywood at all? Take a good, hard look at Hollywood today: does it look as though someone had eradicated the Marxist elements from it? Do you see any Right-wing propaganda films being made there? Do you even see any NEUTRAL, fairly unbiased movies being distributed? I rest my case...In fact, quite to the contrary: nowadays Hollywood is a place where a reverse phenomenon exists, namely so-called 'red-listing'. Actors/directors who vote for Republicans can easily find themselves isolated and desperate for roles the moment their cover is blown. Keeping their politics a secret is a way of life for most of them. Where's the movie about that? The argument that McCarthy was searching for ghosts, witches, aliens, UFOs - i.e. that he was a poor man's Detective Mulder - is an inflated balloon of nonsense. Hollywood - which is teeming with Reds - will obviously play down their rampant Marxism, negating it entirely even.GN&GL picks and chooses only 'facts' that suit their Leftist cause, hence the claim by the movie's liberal producers that this is a 'historical drama' is asinine, misleading, and just further proves what true intentions lie behind this dirty 'little' project...If you want my extensive 'Left-wing Propaganda In Cinema' list, email me.",Null,5,17,6 July 2010
Mulholland Drive," Hipster hype.
","I had this film sitting on my waiting list for many years. Somehow I just didn't come round to it until now. Could it be because everything Lynch did since the 80s sucks? That had a lot to do with it, for sure. I am never in a rush to watch a Lynch movie, despite the fact that there is definitely an element of so-bad-it's-good about all his movies starting from 'Blue Velvet' onwards. (How I laughed at Laura Dern crying in that movie! I blew snot out of my nose watching Hopper sniff on his little gas-mask. Not to mention the pretentious yet hilarious nonsense this vastly overrated 'auteur' dumped at us in his subsequent movies. Damn, 'Lost Highway' is like a mindless Twilight Zone episode without rhyme or reason, and 'Wild At Heart' must be the worst-cast idiotic movie of all time: Dern and Cage? Yes, Lynch must be a genius, sort of the way Ed Wood was a genius.)OK, so the movie has an 'it-was-all-a-dream' plot-twist, a very CONVENIENT scapegoat twist that Lynch was forced to hijack in order not to end up with another mess such as 'Lost Highway' which sets up a mystery but then doesn't wrap it up in any way, shape or form, toddling along instead aimlessly and so very stupidly. The first 90 minutes appear to be Lynch aping Tarantino and other younger directors with yet another fashionable broken-story plot. Then, suddenly - as I knew would happen - the plot completely disintegrates, abandons its broken-story format, and goes all-Lynchian on our ass. The hugely unoriginal it-was-all-a-dream/fantasy plot-twist can only impress people who've never seen one, and mindless hipsters who worship big-name 'auteurs', willing to forgive any nonsense (or be in willful denial about it) just because their reputation is so untouchable. Saying/admitting you dislike a Lynch movie is the equivalent to saying that Picasso did scribbles or that you don't understand Pollock. It's that kind of art-fart con-trick that's been part-and-parcel of the last 50 years of the 'civilized' world. Hell, how do you think hipsterism even came about? Hipsterism is the demon-child of this cowardly mentality, this Satanic triangular marriage of pretentiousness, sloth and con-trickery.Lynch is a charlatan. What, you didn't know? Yes, how dare I mock a 'visionary' who is having a laugh at your expense. Well, not at MY expense certainly, because I see right through this ruse. I am not a slave to peer pressure, which so brilliantly and easily ensures that any weak-minded fool can succumb to what can essentially be referred to as intellectual blackmail. 'You don't appreciate Picasso, Lynch and Sigur Ros? You clueless peasant.' I pity every single fool who ever thought this way. And yet, I also envy these nitwits, for they too inhabit a dream world not unlike Naomi's.So what gave this silly movie such a high rating, aside from Lynch's unshakeable reputation? (A reputation so disaster-proof that he could film himself sitting on a toilet-seat, release it as a feature film - and still get nominated at Cannes.) Without a doubt, it's the lesbianism and Naomi's masturbation. If Naomi had chosen the path that many unsuccessful would-be actresses take - to do smut - and she'd filmed clips for YouPorn or whatever it's called, she'd be just another trashy smut-film slag. But doing this in a Lynch movie? 'Get her an Oscar!' Because if you masturbate in (or to) a Lynch film you're artistic. The vast majority of cinephiles are male, a bunch of those being frustrated nerds/hipsters that love to be titillated - but hate to admit it. (The old cliché of sexual impulse getting in the way of 'intellectual pursuits'.) That's why they love to be titillated in the context of a piece of 'art': that sort of gives them that excuse to not feel shame about their baser impulses. That's partly why so many 'arty' films contain masturbation, incest, pedophilia, and other perversions too tasty for the average film student or critic to not succumb to.Lynch's zombiefied fans espouse the flick's critique of Hollywood. Sure, coming from a director who GETS PAID by those people (while pretending to be a misfit rebel who's above commercial pressures/interests), that's not hypocritical at all. Haven't we already seen tons of movies about the seedy side of Hollywood? Is anyone really still surprised that Tinseltown is a one big turd-factory run by low-life nerds and non-talent nepotists? This was hardly newsworthy in 2001. Besides, Hollywood is so much worse than depicted here. If anything, Lynch should be lambasted for going so easy on his coke-sniffing, pedophile colleagues.Even though he chose to wrap up the muddled set-up in a 'it-was-all-a-dream' package, he still couldn't resist throwing in a bunch of mindless, oafish 'art scenes' which serve to awe the (dumber) viewer, but which really/truly/definitely don't mean absolutely squat. Like that hilarious scene with two tiny people dashing out of the blue box. The last half-hour is like a pretentious, desperate collection of stream-of-consciousness segments lined up without order or sense. But hey! Who gives a hoot, right? Lynch made this so it must be art. It MUST have meaning.Just to make sure his drooling fans don't leave disappointed, Lynch made sure the silicone-implanted brunette and Naomi had ANOTHER cheesy lesbian scene. And he made sure we were reminded what female masturbation looks like. You know, Naomi sticking her hand under her crotch and going 'ow-ow'. Art just doesn't get artier than that!You also gotta love the paradox of portraying Hollywood's seediness - while focusing our attention on two oafish actresses and their sleazy love-affair. As if any intelligent viewer could possibly be interested in the to-and-fro between a couple of trashy lesbians.When hipsterism starts ebbing away, this movie's ridiculous average will starting plummeting too. A direct correlation if there's ever been one.",Null,4,13,29 September 2016
Evil Dead," Utterly pointless mono-colour remake.
","Doing a remake of a classic horror flick that anyone can download hence every horror fan must have already seen is not far from pointless. The destroyed bridge, the happy-go-lucky severed hand, the tree-rape: it's all here – again. The predictability of ED makes it a rather joyless experience, making one long to see the originals again.It's fantasy, sure, but there must be an ounce of logic even in a demonic horror tale. Shiloh gets shot in the shoulder, and yet how does this affect him? Not at all, apparently. He gets bashed, beaten and pulverized repeatedly but this only seems to temporarily stop him. In other words, ironically, he exhibits the same kind of supernatural powers as the demons. If the good guys are invincible and have a few extra gallons of blood in their bodies then I believe it is the duty of the filmmakers to inform us of this, because it can't simply be assumed off-hand. From what I'd seen here, Shiloh must have lost around 150 gallons of blood – with no medical staff around to re-fuel him, mind you.During her first attack, Mia makes the entire house shake, and then speaks in a deep, demonic voice. Despite of this very OBVIOUS supernatural occurrence (that would turn Richard Dawkins into a believer instantly), the others still insist she's having withdrawal symptoms. The blond nerd dabbles in witchcraft but fails to tell his friends a single, solitary detail about what he'd done or read in it, or how it relates to Mia's behavior – until very late in the game. That's just plain stupid, and reveals the writer's opinion of his viewers' intelligence. Admittedly, most movie-goers are buffoons.That whole brother-sister family-history back-story is extremely uninteresting, yet it keeps popping up throughout the movie, as if anybody who'd bought a ticket to watch an 'Evil Dead' remake actually gives three flying dungs.Not to mention the horrible modern look of ED, a visual equivalent of borsht, just one dark green tone for the duration; that's all modern horror films ever give us. Don't these modern directors know that a horror or sci-fi tale can also be told in NATURAL colours? Get the original.",Null,3,6,28 January 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Retarded but entertaining.
","First of all, I am utterly bored with action movies. They are idiotic, repetitive and dull. So for someone to make a sort of homage  admittedly mixed with parody  to this genre says a lot about the person's intelligence. Tarantino, that ol' idiot savant, has great talent with the camera, and certainly can come up with an original scene or two. However: he is a moron. There isn't an iota of intellectuality in him or his movies. Not that this is at all essential in movies, because were it so, there would be about 5 good movies in the last 100 years. So to expect him to make an intelligent movie: this will never, ever happen. That he is fascinated by Asian actioners says a lot about his retardation. He has always been this childish nerd who made very good films and always will be. But while I like all his previous films, it has to be said that they are entertaining but cretinous. 'Kill Bill' is his fourth and most cretinous film to date (as a director). It's also his weakest, perhaps. Rarely boring, I admit, but the action, though stylized, is still just people breaking each other's bones: not so fascinating; it's been done a zillion times. The teenage audiences would disagree, but then again, teens today have never been dumber (rap, fashion, and cell phones being the height of artistry and/or importance in their empty little lives).The positive things about the movie are the music, which is so far the best of all his movies (I particularly hated some of it in 'Pulp Fiction'; God knows why people love that awful soundtrack), the visual quality and the style, and the fact that it does maintain interest.One of the problems I have with it is that I don't quite understand why Tarantino made a film that has comic-book Bugs-Bunny violence in it  and yet tries to make us take the main character and her mission of revenge too seriously. This simply can't work: you either make an all-out silly movie, or you make it in a serious vein, in which case you need action scenes that don't look like they came straight out of a Road Runner cartoon. But this only goes to show what a moron Tarantino is. Lucky for him that 90% of the public are about as dumb as he is, so not many are really bothered by this.Another problem is the cast: the worst so far. I have no idea why, but apart from his first movie, 'Reservoir Dogs', he has always chosen sub-par actors for his movies  with some notable exceptions. In PF he chose Travolta, Arquette, De Medeiros, Thurman Mediocrities. In BB he actually wasted his time casting Bridget Fonda and Keaton, the little twerp playing the cop. This time around, he practically employs a uniformly forgettable cast: Thurman, Carradine, Darryl Hannah Why? Two reasons: 1) It seems Tarantino definitely has a nepotism complex: he loves using sons and daughters of other actors, which maybe makes him feel closer to and hence part of Hollywood mythology and/or royalty; I know, this would be a pathetic and moronic way of thinking but, hey, it's Tarantino we're talking about; after all, when a moron like David Arquette shows up on the scene people talk about 'Hollywood Royalty' (people without half a brain-cell, obviously). 2) Tarantino has revived Travolta's career and brought some other forgotten stars from the 70s (his favourite decade) into temporary spotlight. He must think that he has this power to re-juvenate the career of ANY actor that he wants; perhaps he feels that his movies are so good that any cast will be great in them. Where are the Keitels, Buscemis, Roths, Jacksons, and other good ones he used before? He doesn't have a single high-quality actor in this  in a film with plenty of (colourful - if clichéd) characters. His love for Thurman (and I mean genuine, sexual love) blinds him to the fact that she is a mediocre actress. It's a credit to him that she has been always best in his movies  but that's HER best, not worth much. Every non-Tarantino movie I'd seen her in she was mediocre or even amateurish. Typical model-turned-actress. And his private obsession with her goes so far as to film her disgusting, over-sized feet in one scene. Yuck! Does he actually think her feet are sexy? She's about 185 cm, that damn giraffe! The only potentially sexy thing about her would be her boobs  provided they're real.If you're interested in my 'Hollywood Nepotism List', with over 300 pictures/entries, contact me by e-mail.",Null,2,4,7 February 2007
Saw II," Just as retarded as the first part, this should please lovers of dumb thrillers.
","I thought, 'can't possibly be worse than the first part', and it isn't: but it isn't an iota better either. But this time it was awfully PREDICTABLE, as well.1: From the moment I saw the cop's kid I knew he'd be kidnapped. 2: From the moment I saw the video screens with the kindapees, I knew that it was not happening at the same time as the cops coming in. 3: From the moment the woman appeared that had already escaped in the first part I knew she was in cohoots with the psycho. (Why else would she be put to the test again? That would have been too dumb even for this piece of s*** of a movie. Plus the fact that she's always hanging around the cop's kid should make it obvious even to the most bird-brained film-goer.) 4: From the moment the psycho informed the kidnapees that the 'answer lies in the back of their minds' it was so obvious that they had numbers on their heads. (Why couldn't any of them think of that???? I IMMEDIATELY thought 'check your heads, you dolts'.) 5: From the moment I saw the gangly, silent kidnapee I knew he was in some way connected to the psycho. And as the movie neared the end (thankfully) it became so obvious they'd trap the cop. And the movie isn't original, either: almost the same premise as 'Cube'.I was thinking, 'that cop looks like Marky Mark, no  wait!, looks like Donnie Wahlberg  and in the end-credits it really turned out to be him! They've got a New Kid On The Block playing a tough cop! That should pretty much be a warning in itself.So as far as twists are concerned, the film is a MISERABLE failure. However, in the illogic departement the movie wins standing ovations. Stupidities, absurdities, far-fetchedness. A real mess, once again. Just a few details/questions: why would the muscular guy kill the black guy in order to see the number on the back of his head? How could the psycho POSSIBLY know who the cop framed, and for all those ex-convicts??? For each and every one of them he knew they were framed! What, was the framing released in all DVD clubs for everyone to see??? What is he, a god? He seems to know EVERYTHING. And since he is obviously omnipotent, omnipresent and omni-everything, why not simply call him 'God', and have him fly off with demon wings etc. When you look at the way things turn out in the movie, it seems as if the psycho can predict EVERY thought and EVERY move and EVERY event that ANYBODY makes in advance!!! I mean, we've had movie-killers before who knew too much, who were too smart to be real but THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I had to laugh at times, I really did. The psycho's story of failing to commit suicide with a car crash and then falling off a cliff!!! Now, that's pythonesque! It's high camp! It's comedy! And how about that dumb ending when the woman announces that she's going to 'continue his work'?!!! If the movie weren't so bleak it'd be actually funny, in a 'Plan 9' sort of way.I am curious about 'Saw III'. Perhaps the woman will die of AIDS and a three month-old infant will 'continue HER work'. Who knows what nonsense they'll come up with in the sequel(s).",Null,6,9,9 January 2007
Paranormal Activity," Plenty of 'Normal Activity' for a (home-)movie claiming to offer the paranormal.
","People continually going upstairs downstairs is rather normal activity. People sleeping between midnight and morning I hear is quite common behavior too. Not to mention the exciting arguments over whether the movie's main camera should be recording the trivial proceedings or not. But I guess the movie's title must be referring to the inexplicable hence supernatural effect the movie had of people screaming in theaters as they watched it, their Neanderthal jaws dropping in horror. Only black magic can account for this turkey raking in as much dough as it did.Just because a dozen or so little ol' ladies shrieked in horror while watching PA (they were probably given free tickets by the cunning producers) and then ran out of the theater gasping for air, doesn't mean that the rest of the audience were shaking in terror too. I refuse to believe all those idiotic hype-reports of people fainting while watching this 35-cent crap-o-rama. Or are today's audiences truly that stupid? Have years of viewing Nicholas Cage action flicks and Meryl Streep dramas so exhausted/drained the viewers's collective brains? What's next, a Summer blockbuster comedy filmed by pre-schoolers, which consists of 90 minutes of little boys hitting each other with their Transformers' toys? I don't want to know what historical dramas will look like in 5 years (Actually, they already stink; see 'Alexander'...) A bland yuppie and his chesty but plain-looking (and only slightly less annoying) girlfriend spend several weeks going up and down the stairs in their haunted house, while she berates him for trying to make a low-budget piece of crap horror flick for very easily scared viewers. In the meantime, an inept ghost – who probably failed all his Terrorizing the Living courses at Netherworld University – does all he can to frighten them. The fact that the plot makes it all the way to a 'Night 18' caption sufficiently describes how well the spook had succeeded. You almost gotta feel sorry for the poor undead sap.Why any demon - no matter how lonely, bored, or intellectually hollow he/she/it might be – would actually bother to spend several weeks with these knuckleheads, that's the real mystery here. The couple should have hired a demon-shrink, not a 'demonologist' (an old f**t who leaves the house like a coward at first opportunity - a hilarious bit). After all, all a 'demonologist' can really tell them is what they already know, i.e. that a semi-retarded, barely competent ghost had moved into the house to steal the guy's girlfriend (apparently spooks love big breasts too), but a demon-shrink, on the other hand, could have actually gotten to the bottom of this poor spirit's true mental problems. Perhaps he wasn't loved by his demon parents, or perhaps he just realized that the only way to stop this movie from going on forever is to kill its main protagonist slash director slash cameraman slash day-broker who says 'dude' and 'like' in most sentences slash unconvincing and dull moron slash Micah.Most of the movie consists of the two birdbrains stating the obvious (pointlessly summarizing/commenting on what the viewer had seen just minutes earlier) and then going to bed to lie around while we watch the ghost's feeble attempts to assert himself as the star of the movie. So lousy are the demon's terror-less antics that he can't even get a highly strung woman to panic enough to actually physically leave the house. Instead, Katie starts feeling pity for the ghost, and eventually falls in love with him, allowing him to possess her rather chunky body (plenty of space there).In the end, we get rewarded with the movie's one truly well-shot scene, the one with the hapless yuppie getting slammed into the camera (a Mikah death is a good death, regardless of the manner in which his torso gets hurled). But was that one good scene worth the 85 minutes of pure tedium and in-your-face proud-to-be-crap amateurism? Worse yet, this good scene is followed by Katie smirking into the camera and then assaulting it to eat it? Her figure does suggest a rather undiscriminating diet, soThere's a good reason why fantasy-based horror films only have a chance at being effective when they're STYLISH, i.e. when there is actual effort, talent and money involved. Movies about junkies or lower-class families screaming at each other are sometimes made in low-budget kitchen-sink mode, but that works for (riff-raff) dramas only. You can't expect me to get spooked by a moron with a hand-held camera who talks like a college meat-head, and a dilettante who plays his girlfriend with the conviction of an F-student reading his history report on George III.Still, for whatever it's worth, 'Paranormal Activity' it still scarier than 'The Blair Witch Project'. What I mean to say is that TBWP is 'Bambi' to PA's 'Fantasia'.",Null,2,4,25 February 2010
Big Fish," If this 'magical' love story was inspired by Helena Bonham Carter, then no wonder it failed. The kind of woman only an Emo would stick into his movie...
","First of all, I'd like to thank famous Hollywood Emo Tim Burton for making his latest wife a little more acceptable to watch with all that witch make-up: a definite improvement over her real face. Helena Bonham Carter (what a snotty, preppy name) has also looked far better than herself in that awful 2001 monkey movie playing an ape-esse, and so it is again. Perhaps Tim should have her play a chair next time? Or a pair of socks locked up in a drawer? On the other hand, I'd like to advise Burton to see an eye doctor because if he's going to continue marrying such women, then he ought not complain when one day he does get glasses and realizes in shock that all his kids look like something leftover from a flood. Will you stop casting your talentless wives already?? What is it with these weakling male directors who are p-wipped into submission by their career-greedy wives with little or no talent? Which brings me to my next complaint about this sappy 'Baron Forrest Munchausen Gump' wonder-less concoction: the casting. Why would you cast not one, not two, but THREE British actors to play U.S. Southerners? Why? And I mean WHY. Are all American actors really that bad? On the other hand, when Timmy makes a movie set in England he gets a bunch of Americans to play Brits. What the hell for? The very likable Ewan McGregor had already proved ten years ago that he can't do any American accent, much less a Southern one, in 'Night Watch'; he sounds hopelessly unconvincing in both movies. Tim's wife, Helena Bonham Carter-Burton The Third, can't keep it going either without the occasional screw-up, like the way she pronounced 'impossible'. Finney, on the other hand, gets it right - but then again he is quite a different class of actor than McGregor or the mousy Carter. Casting Jessica Lange was a mistake, too: if you have an old woman in the script then get a woman that LOOKS old, not a surgically-altered former 70s King Kong bimbo (there... the monkeys again) who can barely manage a smile what with all that overly tightened skin. (And then those old actresses complain about not getting any roles!). Watching Finney mess about with Lange in the bathtub wasn't so much a sentimental moment as it was vomit-inducing.The most obvious problem with this movie is... well... the movie itself. Not nearly as syrupy as the pedophilic 'Finding Neverland', and yet it's another 'grand' Hollywood schmaltz-tale, complete with fortune-cookie wisdom, a hollow sentimental soundtrack, clichés galore, and the obligatory death of a main character. Boo-hoo-hoo. Spielberg would have been proud. Not quite as bad as 'The Colour Purple' or any other filmic travesty, to be sure, but still quite a large bundle of stereotypical baloney. The first 20 minutes I had to watch in two separate sittings - that's how dull the intro was.Some stories are okay, some are simply hopeless. When Ewan decides to work 3 years for De Vito to find that damn blonde, I had to wonder... He could have probably found her in half that time, if he had simply LOOKED for her. 'I Love Sandra'. Give me a barf bag. Ewan's character makes such an idealistic ass of himself that I sort of ended up enjoying his getting beaten up by the blonde's fiancé. She then predictably dumps her bully fiancé - which as we know is realistic because all women HATE tough men - and the two of them fall lovingly into the grass that has a heart-shaped indenture in it... So sweet. So absolutely flowery. Such visual prose. I'm touched. I think I'm going to pretend I'm a bored middle-aged housewife and weep into my smelly hankie for a bit...If you carefully look at Helena Bonham Carter-Burton III (I know: a tough proposition) as the witch, she does resemble Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp is hands-down Tim's favourite actor. Tim fell in love with Helena. Draw your own conclusion.BF has some good photography, though not nearly as spectacular as Timmy's best movies, but the emotional side of the story is so utterly cheesy, so predictable, that it can elicit wonder and tears only in indiscriminating, easy-to-impress viewers. Apparently, most of ye people out there belong to that category.Ever notice how similar Helena (without make-up) and Billy Armstrong from Green Day look?",Null,2,11,24 August 2009

So if you're a moron - and you know you're a moron - just stay away from this piece of celluloid greatness, because, honestly, it will just confuse your tiny little mind.The problem is that many morons, apparently, watched this movie, then decided to criticize its pace and story.

Pride & Prejudice," More Jane Austen crap.
","First of all, what a dull novel! I, like many other defenseless (ex-) school kids, was tortured in English class with this overrated drivel. No, not Mark Twain or Edgar Allan Poe. No, it's Jane Austen's soap-opera nonsense for the 19th century that is so often chosen for literature classes all over the (English-speaking) world.A bunch of hormonally-stricken, very bored sisters (there was no TV or internet back then) play a game of 'who-gets-whom', while a parade of men strut around, hoping their alpha-maleness and/or cash will impress the lonely/solo/unpicked/free females that surround them and regularly foam on the mouth. This crap gets yet ANOTHER version to its name, as if all the BBC shows and other movie versions weren't enough. Every time one of those sisters excitedly screams about some officer or hot (or rich) stud, I wanted to press 'stop' on the remote control.Pride? Prejudice? Don't be fooled by the pretentious title, all ye who art uninitiated. This is NOT a 'deep' account with insightful or dare I say philosophical aspects. It's your average 25-cent pulp novel all wrapped up in nice (read: old = respectable) clothing. Occasionally, some character will say something semi-intelligent, but it's not much more exalted than the usual fortune-cookie stuff.The cast. Keira Knightley is an unbearably poor choice to play the 'hottest' sister, the female lead. She is as unsuitable for this role and time period as she is to being an actress. Very little talent, and 'charisma' that consists of the viewer feeling sorry for her for her anorexia and lack of breasts. She is, however, at her most annoying when she SMILES: she does look like an alien in those moments. Watching her silly-shaped mouth form a smile made me squirm and sweat, and believe me it wasn't sexually exciting or anything like it. But why wonder? She is the daughter of successful actors, i.e. the doors were all open for her from day one. Jena Malone was cute and lively, Brenda Blethyn is a good actress, Macfadyen is a good choice for the 'legendary' Darcy, but all of that isn't nearly enough to save this crap.Pride? Prejudice? Feel free to be prejudiced against this crap (i.e. don't watch it) and your pride will remain intact. You can proudly say: 'I did NOT watch the latest Jane Austen drivel!'

Alice in Wonderland," A shoddy cast on top of a lazy script.
","Just another soul-less CGI orgy directed with no apparent effort. All flash but no charm. It's as if a bored computer directed this boring mess – right after a very confused human with silly hair cast it. HAL-9000 already ruined one important space mission. Perhaps ruining a dumb movie pales by comparison, but it was still unnecessary.I cannot say enough bad things about the cast, the movie's glaring weakness. Wiakowska is as bland and average-looking as they come. Of all the pretty, charming girls out there looking to jump-start a movie career Burton couldn't find anyone better than THAT? You kidding me? (But what's to expect from a guy who marries a garden dwarf called Helena Bonham Carter. Taste in beauty?) Her line-delivery comes off as subdued and listless. She'd be ideal to play a young female accountant in some lame-ass drama that nobody really wants to see, but to cast her in a fantasy comedy – as the title character no less – shows extraordinary incompetence on the part of the film-makers. Burton either picks great actors for his roles or the worst; he doesn't seem to cater to the mid-quality range.But Burton's casting screw-ups don't end there. Hiring Crispin Glover as anything other than a bizarre nerd is bringing optimism to absurd new levels. (Actually, hiring him – period – is pretty daft.) The man can't act! The industry had tried already to turn him into some kind of a cult-status mini-legend, kind of like Ron Howard's brother, and that might have worked with the more easy-to-please zombies, I mean viewers, but to me he will always be a dull nepotist with very limited abilities/range and low on charisma. To cast him as a VILLAIN, no less, means that Burton had been sniffing not just glue, not just Bolivian mushrooms while making this movie, but perhaps he'd even been sniffing the rabbit's poo marbles too.You know what they say in show-biz circles: 'marry Tim Burton and you shall never have to kneel for roles again'. Helena Bonham Carter, the overrated British 'royal' (her grandfather was Prime Minister! Her parents were in the movie industry in high positions, and there are all sorts of genetically exhausted lords and baronesses there too), married out of interest just as her 'royal' ancestors had on numerous occasions, and much as Alice was supposed to. (The irony.) Don't you hate directors who ALWAYS have to stick their wives/girlfriends/mistresses into their films? It reeks of unprofessionalism, not to mention that it makes Burton look like a mug who let's wifey wear the pants. Helena's pathetic turn as an unfunny evil queen instantly reminded me of Miranda Richardson's funny portrayal of Queen Elizabeth in 'Blackadder', or an inferior and idiotic imitation of it, to be precise. If Burton blew snot out of his nose watching his wife play this character, then he must be even more impressionable and easy-to-please than teeny-bopper fans of One Direction. How about Anne Hathaway? She's supposed to be the movie's star beauty. We've always known that Burton's aesthetic sense was bizarre, in a good way - because many of his movies got a great look as a result of it, but it's a double-edged sword, isn't it. He may know what a creature or a castle should look like, but that also translates in a very deranged, skewered, warped taste in women. As if Hathaway didn't have a mouth already big enough to swallow a yawning hippo, he gave her a TON of lipstick which gives the impression that Anne only has a mouth. And that it's bigger than Stephen Fry's cat's mouth.Speaking of which, the Cheshire cat is supposed to be one of the stars of the story, but instead had been turned into a minor annoyance due to Fry's uninteresting, self-important, non-funny, stupid voice. The only good move Burton made was casting Depp, who is fairly interesting. But even he struggles to keep our interest due to the shoddy script that amounts to not much more than a very stereotypical good-vs-evil plot that contains zero excitement – unless you're 5 years old. (In which case you anyway shouldn't be watching this coz Hathaway's huge mouth gave the movie an R rating.) Alan Rickman gets a tiny voice-over while Glover gets a key role! Burton Tim, shouldn't Rickman have played the villain? Anyone with half a brain would have cast Rickman as the Queen's henchman instead of that little nepotist Glover who obliterates that role.The first 30 minutes are half-way watchable, but this CGI opera then quickly deteriorates, due to shoddy casting choices, but also because the plot is so abysmally boring. The gags also fail, and they just keep failing. There are maybe 2-3 instances when something funny or amusing is being said.And then, just to make sure we know how much he hates his audiences, Burton ends the movie with the tender hysterical yelping of one called Avril Lavigne. Did someone lobotomize Burton? No, wait: that's the result of working for Hollywood for such a long period of time. Anyone in his shoes ends up lobotomized. Must be something about the air in California.",Null,2,5,5 October 2016

But SR doesn't care about that, or is utterly unaware of it: his main character is a fairly blameless, likable, hard-working blonde, hence a poor choice as the victim of an evil curse. It was a poor, illogical choice - unless, of course, SR wanted to annoy the viewers. But considering how successfully, abundantly, and excessively he'd annoyed us with his inept Spiderman films, a change of strategy in this regard would have been well advised.So confused is the director, that he tried to make the girl less likable - deserving of Hell - by making her ambitious, career-wise. Her 'great unforgivable sin' was to refuse the witch's wish to go on ignoring her mortgage payments. (Huh?) Sam, you were a poor, hard-working young director with ambitions of producing daft super-hero flicks once, remember? Does that make you curse-worthy? Actually...The medium says she'd been 'waiting for years to redeem (herself) for losing the boy's soul to the demon' - but how does that fit with in with her demands for a 10,000-dollar cash payment for her failed anti-demonic séance? So basically her feet itched for this opportunity to arise again - but when it does, she places an obstacle by charging a ridiculous amount of money for it. That's SR logic for ya, right there... Those 10,000 bucks could have been put to better use: a tighter script, and with any money that's left over, a lobotomy for the director too.The brief excursions into slapstick comedy (a-la 'Evid Dead') only underline SR's confusion. He couldn't quite make up his mind whether he wanted this to be an all-out cartoonish comedy or a proper horror film.So what exactly is the moral of the story, the whole point? I guess it must be this: mortgage payments should be optional, especially when it comes to evil grandmas, and anyone who refuses to pay them should keep his house anyway. And anyone who dares stand in their way (an 'evil' bank, for example) are immoral bastards who need to die and go to Hell. This, in a nutshell, is SR's value system. (You old Socialist, you...) Or am I a looking too hard into this, expecting naively for SR to actually have a point to make in his Donald Duck movies? The fact that SR vents all his frustrations on a cute blonde also makes one wonder about his past. His past as a young geek getting rejections left-and-right from the school's cheerleaders. Is SR just a plain old vengeful nerd who can never forget?DMTH offers a plethora of SR's own 80s clichés. He recycled, pillaged, and ransacked his 'Evil Dead' trilogy like there was no tomorrow. Perhaps he had felt that he'd quasi-sold his soul to the Devil by making 'Spiderman', hence tried to redeem himself by going back to his young days, his earlier years as a useful director (as opposed to his current state of being a tired imitation of his younger self.) The ending is pitiful. Has any viewer older than three really been surprised that she will get killed in the end? The envelopes had been switched! Wow.

There's Something About Mary," There's Nothing About Mary. Absolutely nothing.
","The only funny thing about Mary is that someone would believe the premise that a bunch of guys would go gaga over an ugly blonde. A blonde that looks like Andy Warhol after a sex-change. The rest of the cast is almost as bad; it's as if the Farrellys sabotaged their own script on purpose.Come to think of it, they do that in nearly all of their movies. Their inept choice of actors is only 'topped' by the Coen brothers' recent flops, or the senile Scorsese sticking that Lea Di Capria in all of his films. That's a man? You could have fooled me... Nobody can fool me.Ben Stiller is an abomination, one of the unfunniest box-office-hit 'comedian' in the history of cinema (alongside Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler). Giving Matt Dillon stupid fake teeth is somehow meant to turn him into a top comedian? And so on. How I envy people who love this turkey: they'll laugh at anything.

Mission: Impossible," A somewhat fun, quite idiotic action film.
","Better than Woo's sterile sequel, but has the unmistakable stamp of De Palma's illogic. Except, this time it isn't so much illogic as total confusion for the viewer. The plot twists and the conspiracy haze go quite far, and it isn't long after one gives up in trying to understand who is doing what to whom for what reason. The movie isn't boring, I'll give it that; De Palma's films are rarely boring. However, there is also a casting problem: Rhames - of all people - plays a computer expert, a hacker, no less. This is absolutely ridiculous. Then we have the old and nearly fat Jon Voight karate-chopping the young James Bond-type Tom Cruise character. Even more absurd, Voight's wife is Emmanuelle Beart. These two are as convincing a pair as Bob Dole and Britney Spears would be. The action sequences with the helicopter are Woo-esquire: Cruise blows up the chopper and the explosion throws him - unharmed - onto the train, which is going at around 200 km/h. And then a part of the chopper fails to impale him by a mere millimeter. These scenes were truly prophetic because Woo - the king of absurdist action scenes - took over in the sequel. Beart comes complete with a set of fake breasts and an upper lip so pumped up with silicone (or whatever it is they inject there) that her mouth is perpetually pursed to kiss someone.",Null,2,5,4 January 2007

Yes, but does that even begin to make up for a plot so ridiculous it could have been written by Ed Wood's nostril in a nano-second? It is rare that I so give up on a movie that I have to fast-forward certain scenes to get it over with. Check out the mind-bogglingly dumb ending: one of the dumbest in the history of ALL cinema.

The Legend of 1900," Improves with every minute.
","No major SPOILERS here.Starts off as one of those European, 'grand' (read: pretentious-looking), overly sentimental turn-of-the-century epics, but it gradually, steadily but firmly, starts growing on you. It's a highly idealized bio of a larger-than-life fictional character. I moaned when Roth, as a child, immediately learned to play the piano with great skill the day he first saw it. But, as I said, Roth plays a larger-than-life guy so anything goes; there are practically elements of fantasy here, even though this isn't literally spelled out. One has to accept the otherwise absurd premise that a man who is born on a ship, willingly spends half a century aboard it without once setting foot on land. Yet the movie is shot so well, and combined with the pleasant music (not 'pleasant' as in 'puts you to sleep') it pulls you in, especially in the second half. Roth appears too aloof for a while and his character too mysterious and undefined, but his long, very interesting speech to the trumpet player at the end of the movie clarifies a lot in a strange and original way. It's always good to be pleasantly surprised by a movie that starts off not-very promisingly, and then improves so much that it's never boring and even fascinating all the way to the end. It doesn't even matter that 1900 grew up with an American foster parent, but - as Roth - developed a British accent. The movie is good, so I'll leave the nit-picking for some other time...",Null,3,7,13 October 2007
From Hell," Yet another (average) filmization of the Jack the Ripper tale.
","From the makers of 'Menace II Society' comes a stylized tale of terror and conspiracy in 19th century London... I don't think so. It is evident from the cast and the look that a fair amount of money has been gone into this, but visually the movie isn't as good as the money put into it should have achieved. The mood isn't as somber and real as the directors were going for. The Hughes brothers? I don't think so. I smell a bit of affirmative action; perhaps not as much as with Spike Lee, but something's there. These guys are not that talented.Once again Americans are cast to play Brits (or vice versa) and this is a mystery to me. Depp's accent is acceptable but why should the viewer even bother getting used to Depp with an atypical accent when a British actor would have been just as fine? Heather Graham is much more problematic, but because of her miscasting: there is almost nothing about her appearance that connects her in any way with either a prostitute or a ragged 19th century British woman - let alone both. Otherwise the casting and the cast is good (including Depp, once you get used to the accent). There was something bogus about the scene with the Elephant Man; it seemed fake and out-of-place. Besides, why should a Jack the Ripper tale include the Elephant Man in any way at all? It would be like making a drama about a Spanish family and the father is a matador, while the mother is a flamenco dancer. Why the clichés? An absurd character is the pathologist who is so grossed out at looking at Ripper's victims that he even vomits in one scene - as does his assistant! What pathologist would vomit upon seeing a butchered body?! They're used to all sorts of s***! And if the pathologist vomits then Coltrane and Depp should be puking for hours.Just the idea of doing Jack the Ripper is problematic: too much is known about the case (even though it hasn't been solved), therefore the element of surprise is gone in many ways. I don't really have a problem with the plot that was devised: basically the writers came up with a huge conspiracy theory, a major cover-up of the Ripper's evil doings; everyone is in on it: the masons, the top policemen, the medical community - and even Queen Victoria herself! (Basically, the entire British elite.) Still, the inclusion of masons is rare in films so that was okay. It was predictable that Holm was the Ripper: I recognized his voice during the first (or second) murder, way before his identity is revealed. I thought it was far-fetched that Depp didn't go to visit Graham and the child, even after years had passed; surely he wouldn't have to be worried that he'd be followed non-stop for years by the masons. Because the details of the Ripper tale are so familiar the first half of the movie is weaker than the second half, in which more of the newer ideas and unknown things occur. All in all solid, but elements of predictability and the lack of real style make it less interesting.http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/johnny_depp__a_biography",Null,3,5,5 January 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A vile piece of crap from a truly degenerate Marxist director.
","Pasolini's most notorious film, and that's saying just about everything. If you enjoy homosexuality, rape, excrement, genital torture, sexual degradation, and other moronic perversions, you'll love this piece of garbage. But even thrill-seeking perverts might be somewhat disappointed: the film is made in such a way as to be highly tedious. Its rhythm is monotony pure: perversion, long speech, perversion, long speech, perversion, and so on Pasolini has set this collection of depravities in WWII Fascist Italy, so this cretinous 'story' is supposed to be some sort of a metaphor for how immoral extreme right-wing regimes are. Anybody who is fooled by this has themselves to blame, for this is obviously just a bad excuse to indulge in everything which Pasolini probably himself (secretly) loves. And anyway, how hypocritical of this MARXIST to 'expose' the brutality of a right-wing dictatorship, while supporting Communist regimes of the worst kind. For people like him, the slaughtering of millions in the name of Marx and Lenin is perfectly acceptable, it's just not okay when the extreme right-wing does it. Pasolini is just another hypocritical left-winger with nothing intelligent to convey. Has anybody ever seen a film of his that is intelligent and has a real point? Another thing: Pasolini loves hiring amateur actors, so you can expect some truly horrible acting  especially from the youths playing the (sex-)slaves.",Null,20,48,8 January 2007
The Descent," Women get slaughtered in a badly-lit cave.
","Apart from the violent opening scene, very little happens for quite a while. This early part of the movie is spent not on thrills, but on getting us acquainted with the half-dozen main characters, all of which are women. If at least there were some eye-catchers in that bunch, but they're mostly average-looking or worse  and the dialog is dull.Once the mayhem finally starts, it's relatively bloody, which distracts from the clichés, of which there are more than a few. Having a cave as the setting for the slaughter is a two-edged sword. On one hand, things can get quite claustrophobic, but on the other, it's just an excuse to keep many scenes badly-lit in order to save on the monsters' special effects and make-up. The creatures are solid, but nothing to shout about, looking a lot like Gollum's relatives and friends.So if you like the idea of having dozens of Gollums slaughter a couple of women in a cave, you shouldn't pass on this movie.",Null,3,6,17 January 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," So basically Harry Potthead killed Cedric by saving him in the maze...
","An improvement over the third part. HPATGOF is more dynamic, and the humour works better. Not surprisingly, there's more excellent photography and many new gimmicks, some of which remind very much of the LOTR trilogy - Tolkien's books being an endless source of ideas for Rowling.I would like to say that the lead kid trio have all grown into their roles, but I can't. While marginally better overall than in previous installments, it's only Emma Watson who has a pretty good grip on what she's doing. The kid playing Ron, though ideally cast as far as charisma and the way he looks, seems a little lost in certain scenes, while Radcliffe still cannot shake off the the blandness that is in his nature.Radcliffe has been cast through some serious connections (his father is a literary agent (what a coincidence!) and his mother a casting agent (another coincidence - amazing!)). Nepotism is NOT the way to go when you're spending something in the order of a billion dollars on making seven movies based on hugely popular kiddie books. However, nowadays the masses are totally uncritical, would watch/accept ANYONE playing Harry Potter (even Paris Hilton, I guess), so from the commercial standpoint I guess it didn't really matter much. I guess in an age when even David Arquette (give me a barf-bag...) can be a star there is nothing to prevent ANY person with influential parents from stardom - no matter how limited or non-existent their talent.Or maybe talent isn't really required to pass off as an average actor?As for the casting of other new faces, the guy playing Viktor was a good choice, same goes for Cedric, but I wasn't sure about the French girl; she wasn't attractive enough. But then again, she DOES have a dad who is a theater director, and that as we all know (at least the ones who care) certainly can't hurt when hunting for movie stardom.Unfortunately, no Thewlis and Oldman this time, but there are still Rickman, Gambon and the charming Richardson to provide for some good stuff, from the adult side of the cast.If you want to have look at my Hollywood Nepotism List, with over 400 photos/entries, contact me by e-mail.",Null,1,4,24 September 2007
The Happening," M. Night Charlatan's predictable little politically-correct message-movie.
","I've got some very, very bad news for PETA and other vegans and veggies... Apparently, plants can communicate with one another, think, and even plan out highly-organized attacks in which humans commit mass-suicides. What does this harbor for the future? It means that from now on PETArds will have to abandon flora as their only source of nourishment (and what a shame it would be to not have all those noble vegan minds survive!). After we've all learned in recent decades that animals have souls and legal rights, that dolphins can calculate complex mathematical equations, that cow milk has clandestine poisons, that bunnies are in fact deeply philosophical beings, and last but not least that fish are 'kittens of the sea' - now it turns out that mere plants are the Lucrecia Borgias of the forests. First they were carnivores, then vegetarians, and then the uniquely astute vegans: the logical next step for Petards would be to become 'airians': perhaps we can convince the world's most brilliant scientific minds to work on finding ways to feed the rising numbers of Petards with... air...? Throw some ketchup on it - and voilÃ ! L'oxygene de la yummy-yummy.Unfortunately, air can only serve as food until we find out that oxygen, too, has a soul and an intelligence, hence has the right to live undisturbed and unkilled. After this happens (and no doubt it will be Hollywood or Moby the DJ to be the first to sell this marvelous idea to us) they'll have to find not only alternative ways to feed themselves but to breathe as well! Perhaps carbon dioxide? Sure, it's poisonous, but it might not have a soul. It ain't easy being a PETArd...'Signs' was pathetic and 'The Village' was drawn out and filled with a truly horrible cast, so I really didn't expect much from the latest MNC offering. The downward quality curve in Mr.Charlatan's career is as plain and obvious as Madonna's tooth-gap. And, as if wanting to emulate that in his movies as well, 'The Happening' is pretty much the same: it starts off very well, but gets worse and worse, heading shamelessly into a conclusion so predictable, that even fans of Latin soapers would sniff it out from afar.Tuh-duh: it's nature fighting back against man! Man: that wicked, wicked Industrialist, that bipedal Capitalist creature that actually dares exploit the resources of this planet to stay alive. We've already had this kind of nonsense in movies before (hence the silly premise isn't even original) such as in 'The Last Winter'; but at least the said movie was very well-acted and had top-notch photography and good dialogue. 'The Happening', on the other hand, is directed with the vigour of a nursing-home nap, and written with the ingeniousness of a glue-sniffing 6th-grader. The dialogue and the acting were always dangerously teetering on the edge of unintentional comedy, but it's small wonder when you have Marky Mark cast in the leading role as a CARING SCIENCE teacher. The less said about the minute - and endlessly irrelevant - subplot concerning his apathetic wife cheating on him, the better. And I will also try not to mention that when the train stops at a remote Pennsylvanian village, everyone suddenly has cars to hop into when panic breaks out... I guess perhaps cars might be conscious beings too, much like terrorist plants, hence are able to drive on their own in search of their human owners... Who am I to say it isn't possible? I am neither as brilliant as Mr.Charlatan nor as intellectually perceptive as PETArds.'Run from the wind, run!' When a movie has the main characters trying to out-run a wind, you know you're in trouble. Or perhaps it wasn't a wind, but this script f**ting.If there is anything nature should rebel against, it's the poisonous fumes coming out of Tinseltown's derriere.I guess it's too much to ask from Tinseltown to make the occasional horror film, thriller - let alone drama - these days without spicing them up with some lame Leftist-propaganda nonsense. Either it's gay rights, or it's pollution, or it's about evil market economies, or how murderous and conspiratorial those oh-so corrupt evil Western democracies are, etc etc etc.The easiest thing in the world is to write something preachy and predictable - especially when it's this retarded. But presenting the increasingly dumbed-down audiences with an actual original story, devoid of political malarkey, with intelligent dialogue and a cast uninfected with talentless nepotistic offspring: that, I guess, is too much to ask for.Zoooooey Dechanel has the acting skills of a tired amoeba.

The Fountain," Finally something good.
","The best, and certainly the most inventive, movie since 'The Machinist' and 'Possible Worlds'. Three very rare gems in this very weak movie decade.The unique blend of sci-fi and she's-dying-of-cancer disease-of-the-week schmaltz may seem like an absurd and undoable mix, but Aronofsky has made those two gel perfectly. I love sci-fi and absolutely detest 'disease(d) melodramas', so even more power to him for managing to pull this off in such a way that I am not only prevented from writing yet another hateful diatribe, but actually only have good things to say about a movie.Visually slick, the movie constantly jumps between three vastly different periods and settings. This will put off the more brainless among ye, plus the fact that everything is not spelled out for the viewers. I.e. there is a sufficient amount of free-to-interpret aspects which is the way I like it with any story that goes beyond the traditional themes and structures. For example, it isn't quite clear whether the bald, futuristic Jackman is the 21st-century scientist many centuries older (and 'cured' from death) or a different person, merely representing yet another resurrected male half of the ill-fated couple.It's commendable that Aronofsky has gone back to creating intelligent movies like 'Pi'. 'Requiem For A Dream' was a trite drug-user-drama piece of Dreck which I thought might be signaling his very early fall from grace. (The fact that IMDb-ers consider it the best Aronofsky film says it all.) I'm glad I was wrong, because it seems that besides him and a handful of others there are no high-quality writer-directors around at present. This is an age in which a nepotistic, incompetent boor like Sofia Coppola is considered to be a brilliant 'auteur'. But then again, the best of any age were usually underrated, overlooked or almost totally ignored.TF is one of those rare movies that stick in your mind, force you to think about it long after the end-credits roll, which is always refreshing.At the start I thought that the soundtrack wasn't good enough, but by the time the movie ends, the music kind of grows on you.The only slight criticism I could make is Weisz's casting. She looks rather boyish, i.e. not feminine enough, especially with the short hair. Picking out a true beauty would have been better.",Null,6,10,15 March 2008
Zombieland," Girl power... Lara Croft in Wonderland.
","Rule 25: don't make the zombies run, especially in a zombie comedy. They're just not as much fun that way.There are only a handful of gags, and they induce mild chuckling, the rest is predictable ha-ha silly/funny-zombie fare. The single most idiotic aspect of ZL is the idea that two teeny-boppers would: a) con the few survivors they meet in the wasteland that is Zombieworld, instead of teaming up with them, and b) that they would actually have the brains to do it.WHY exactly would they or any other half-way intelligent survivor want to con anyone? The stores are open 0-24, absolutely everything is for free, so what possible reason would there be to steal from the only few people who stayed alive? On one hand the two moronic teens are described/defined as 'smart, cunning girls', but what intelligent person would try to make human enemies what with the zombie threat that is all around them... Besides, I don't see how they could have survived more than a minute when one considers the poor judgment they display when they decide that it's a great idea to start up the amusement park... So they're idiot savants or what? Autistic?Rule 356: don't make the characters behave dumber than the zombies; it's neither logical nor funny.Comedy works only when there is a trace, a hint of realism behind it. The idea that a pair of sisters would have the need to STEAL from the handful of remaining survivors - when they can take anything they want whenever they need it - is too asinine even for a dumb zombie comedy. If the makers of this forgettable tripe wanted unapologetic stupidity they should have gone all-out, i.e. 'Police Academy' style. If you're going to shove into our faces cretinous characters and write infantile plot-twists, you might as well go all the way, and make money off the low-brow viewers who number in their tens of millions these days...They tried to justify the poor logic of the girls' actions by portraying them as 'hard-to-trust kids'. What flimsy argumentation. What is this, Oprah, suddenly? 'I've got trust issues, ya know...' As I said, why even try to explain these characters' motives - as was done on several occasions (as if I could be made to care about these cardboard characters) - when you can go for all-out Pauly Shore 'hilarity'. If you're gonna be an imbecile you might as well be gung-ho about it and do a zero-IQ farce.Rule 10,380: feature more zombies in a zombie film. But whatever little the movie had going for it was lost in the Bill Murray segment. The idea of having the four idiots go to a movie star's mansion was a good one, but it was utterly ruined with another idiotic/unfunny - because unrealistic - plot-twist: Bill wants to play a prank on the nerd, and VERY predictably gets killed. Woody and Stone (the latter who is supposed to be 'intelligent', remember) fail to realize that he will probably get shot at by Eisenberg/Cera. (Stupid and predictable: a safe bet to not make me laugh.) The movie hits its absolute low point - and I mean minus 273 Celsius - when Bill talks with a huge open chest wound as if he were in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Or are we suddenly in a Python sketch? Yet, only minutes later, what follows this dull, surreal scene is an actual romantic(!)/semi-serious moment between Stone and nerd-boy. Who the hell cares! Zero thought has been put into the writing of this crap, and it shows, every five minutes. Pity, because the director's skills aren't negligible and the cast is good. Harelson is great, but even he cannot squeeze out more than a few drops from this drained orange. Emma is gorgeous, so that helps a bit too. Yet again it's the script that is Hollywood's undoing.This is the ideal movie for people who have never seen a zombie film, let alone a zombie comedy. In their wide-eyed inexperience, they probably gape at this, their jaws dropping all the way to their drool-stained smelly popcorn, thinking 'wow!'.

War of the Worlds," Almost as silly as Scientology's aliens
","Is this the sequel to 'E.T.'? The brown monster went back to his home planet, described Spielberg and Drew Barrymore to his brethren, and then they made the only decision that made any sense: destroy all humans.A remake of a truly idiotic 50s flick. Trust Spielberg not to have made it much more intelligent than the original. I can certainly see the mountains of effort that Spielberg and his jaded special-effects crew put into E.T.'s little blood-sucking pals: they're like a cross between parrots, spiders, and Wall-E. Real scary. Scar-E.'This is not war. This is extermination,' says one of the human buffoons. So why did they call it 'War of the Worlds' then? I would have gone for a more edwoodsian, i.e. more suitable title, such as 'Attack of the Blood-Sucking Vampires From Space'. At least that name would act as a kind of excuse for the movie's considerable silliness.True to Spielberg's idea of 'sci-fi fun', there's the obligatory smart- ass kid(s). A lot of hysterical bitch-screaming by the girl. But considering she's Cruise's kid, no wonder she's so mentally unstable. Daily lashings of breakfast-accompanying sectarian brainwashing will turn any child into a mess. I don't think she was screaming because Earth was being invaded; I believe she screams like this all the time. 'I want a different daddy!' Not only does she scream 2,315 times from start to finish, but her father and brother keep carrying her around as if she were either an invalid, badly wounded, or 5 years old. She's around 12, healthy as a pit-bull. (Alone the incessant screaming attests to that). If anything, she should be in better physical shape than Cruise, who is almost as short as her, and rather old by now. SHE should have been carrying HIM! Sure, that would have elicited a few unwanted(?) laughs, but it's not as if WOTW is '2001: A Space Odyssey'...Many idiotic/funny scenes, such as when Cruise & co. get mobbed. He fires a shot, and INSTANTANEOSLY everyone stops in their tracks, goes silent, as if a single bullet-shot (amidst all the chaos hardly a note- worthy event) would get a foam-at-the-mouth, rabid mob to suddenly cease all destructive activities. In fact, the entire movie is like this: Spielberg's masses of runaway humans all behave in pretty much the same way in any given situation. Not much variety. Spielberg would have us believe that a dimwit like Tom Cruise turns out to be the most sensible/intelligent individual in the country! If that's true, we're all in trouble...Cruise eventually ends up on a farm, the residence of a mentally challenged man. I mean Tim Robbins, of course. And then Cruise starts singing and you know that Spielberg had lost his tiny mind, much like Cruise when he bounced up and down Oprah's couch, or like Tim when he thought he understood enough about world politics to start speaking publicly about it. Michael Madsen had stated that Robbins imitated him in WOTW. And imitated poorly, I might add. Robbins is a rank amateur (even worse than expressionless, baby-faced Cruise): the son a popular country singer, i.e. your run-of-the-mill nepotistic offspring, with the I.Q. of a Scientology manual and the acting/directing talent of Pia Zadora's right toe.More spielbergian malarkey comes during the alien-stares-at-mirror scene. I've seen cats who figure out sooner that they're staring into their own image. An intergalactic civilization that hadn't invented the mirror yet... That's SS for ya Spielberg's movies are full of extinct lizards with high IQs and 'advanced' aliens who act like morons. What an intellectual this Oscar-obsessed Tinseltown nerd is...Perhaps the funniest scene is Cruise pinning down his son, while observing the kidnapping of his daughter happening nearby. 'What shall I do??' he must have thought. 'Should I keep sitting on my son's stomach, or should I rush to save my daughter from these annoying do-gooders??' He makes an astonishing decision: he chooses to stay seated on his son a little while longer, and that made me laugh for an entire minute. His son wanted to battle the aliens with his bare fists, while his daughter screamed every 5 seconds: ample proof that Scientology simply doesn't work, at least not in the child-rearing department.Aliens are playing hide-and-seek with them, yet what are Cruise and Robbins doing? They engage in Silent Shotgun Arm-wrestling. I really don't know what else to call it! Just like a Marxist and a Scientologist to engage in puerile activity at the worst possible time.'Not my blood, not my blood!' screams Robbins. Relax, Tim! Who the hell would want your blood? That inferior produce The aliens would have skipped that particular 'feast'. Speaking of which, the WALL-Es employ a rather wasteful blood-sucking method: they impale a human, then suck what little blood there is left after they'd already spilt more than half of it all over the ground. Sort of like wanting to drink milk by smashing the bottle against a wall: really, really wasteful.The end features the obligatory soppy spielbergian family reunion scene. SS truly is Hollywood's CHEESE KING. And voilà! Cruise's son is miraculously still alive. There wasn't a dry eye in the house; Oprah- loving housewives were sobbing, the rest were laughing.So Tim Robbins, the Great American Liberal and opponent of military spending, didn't see any irony in appearing in a movie in which humans needed all the weapons they could get to fight a formidable enemy? But I forgot: the aliens were killed by the flu. Mankind needed no weapons at all. Aliens' preparations for the invasion lasted 'a million years' and yet this supposedly highly advanced species never even bothered to check Earth's bacteriological/viral landscapeEvidently, these Spielbergian aliens were beginners in matters of invasion.

30 Days of Night," Not based on a chewing-gum wrapper, thank God.
","There used to be a time when movies had been based on novels. Then, when they ran out of good novels to adapt to the screen, they resorted to cheap dime-a-dozen novels. Then short stories, and now comic-books. I guess it's only a matter of time until big-budget flicks use pamphlets as their inspiration... Chewing-gum wrappers, too? Toilet-paper rolls?...Even worse, yet another vampire film.The good news, however, is that not all comic-book-based films have to be unwatchable pieces of childish Dreck a-la 'Spiderman' or 'Ghost Rider'. The other good news is that this isn't yet another dreary vampire flick. 30DON is the best ever horror film with fanged bipeds, if we discount 'The Hunger' which is more like a horror drama. Gone is the suave, cape-wearing, coffin fetishist who woos the thick, impressionable maiden with his outlandish foreign accent. That's about as scary as an episode of 'Will & Grace'. The third piece of good news is that the director of the legendarily asinine 'Hard Candy' doesn't deliver rubbish this time around.These vampires aren't interested in chit-chat, their coffins are well out of the viewers' sight, and they never open their mouths simply to reveal clean, polished, white Hollywood dentures. The make-up is terrific, unusual, the fact that they use an unrecognizable language gets thumbs up too. An extra third thumb up goes for the leader of the vampires; for the actor who plays him so well, and his overall look and behaviour. He never snickers like the stereotypical blithering idiot baddie, and that's rare in such movies too.Sure, there's some nonsense, after all this is a vampire flick. The logic isn't all there, but the stylish direction, the visually impressive locations, and a fast pace make up for the flaws.I would just like to know why an Owen-Wilson-like pipsqueak such as Ben Foster gets cast in sci-fi ('Pandorum') and horror films. I was kind of hoping that the days of midget-heroes (Cruise, Gere, Dorff, Slater) were coming to an end. Wrong again...",Null,3,5,30 March 2010
Wedding Crashers," No wonder this crap has a high IMDb rating...
","Wilson and Vaughn are hardly comedic heavy-weights to carry a comedy on their shoulders, especially one based on a forgettable script. Besides, they don't have that much charisma. And Ferrell fails again to be funny. (Why is there so much hype regarding this guy?) To make things worse, there is plenty of totally absurd, dull sentimentality, especially in the second half. All these semi-cartoon characters are established early on - and we are supposed to take them seriously later on?? You can't have your cake and eat it, too. A screwball comedy AND a romantic drama. Come on...Christopher Walken is the only high-quality actor in this average cast, but his role is too small to make a difference. The movie has no funny moments; it is merely somewhat interesting to watch, at least until the inevitable moment when things start getting too predictable and soppy i.e. formulaic. And the movie lasts nearly two hours: FAR too long for a (mostly dull) comedy.",Null,0,2,7 October 2007
Downfall," Der Untergang des Europaeischen Filmes.
","If you want an entertaining German movie, I suggest you try 'Der Schulmaedchenreport 4'. So much better in every way...Actually, Germans are not known for making good movies, and this little Bunker-Tage bio of Hitler is an indication why. The acting is mostly unimpressive, and Hitler comes off as a comic character. Of course, this is always a problem with portraying Hitler; he was so outrageous/absurd/unreal in every way that it's almost impossible to play him without the performance looking like a broad parody of him.Hence, whenever Hitler (Ganz) shouts - and he shouts and bitches like a wild dog a dozen times at least - I was more inclined to giggle than to get into the drama of the moment. There's plenty of saliva flying out of Ganz's mouth, and if this movie were shown in 3D I would have feared that some might land into my face. Not a pleasant thought! Even Charlie Chaplin's spoof has more of the real person than Ganz's totally animated, overly grumpy Hitler.Okay, the film isn't that bad. The subject-matter is too interesting to be botched even by a German film-crew, but the close-to 150-minute length is a bit of a problem, too. Frankly, to me the highlight of the movie was the ending, and I'm not trying to be funny. The outro, which reveals what happened to each of the main characters is interesting, but I guess that info one could get in the books or the internet anyway.You can count yourself lucky if you don't speak German, because if you read the subtitles then the acting and the dialogue don't seem as imperfect as they really are. (This is the case with Bergman films, too.) If you see it in German then you realize just how hard some of these actors try but simply can't get their act together.Besides, you just know that the Germans could never resist injecting a note of humanity into the main Nazi characters. (A little bias, perhaps...?) I found it laughable how some of these top Nazi psychopaths/sociopaths were portrayed. Another problem is that I could not really feel for any of the German 'civilians'/volunteers dying as they defended Berlin. Why? Because considering how many millions of deaths were caused by Germany in WW II - of which the concentration camps represented the worst - I really didn't care that much...If you are unhappy with this dull Hitler flick, which you must be, just google 'Vjetropev Hitler Spoofs' and this will lead you to my video clips with the vastly improved movie. Have fun.For a truly (unintentionally) funny German movie, try 'Der Schnibbler'. I hear it's Edwoodesque.",Null,5,42,14 July 2009
Scream 2," Yet another moronic slasher horror/comedy.
","Forget all intelligence, all ye who view this...As was to be expected, this is a sub-par horror film; a commercial and idiotic venture to cash in on the recent and inexplicable slasher-film revival, which the equally dumb first part helped start. It's a self-indulgent piece of crap, with its lame film-buff in-jokes and sad attempts to be original and funny by satirizing sequels, films in general, and even itself. Craven and his gang of 'creators' are so concerned with misleading and confusing the viewer as to who the killer may be, that they totally ignore the need for logic, or at least a decent amount of credibility ('decent' being very little, since this is the slasher genre - the worst horror sub-genre; its ugliest offspring, so-to-speak). I quickly saw through Craven's 'trick' to give all (key) characters motives for being killers, early on (an old, old Agatha Christie tool), and then have them suspect each other. So I tried thinking logically (a mistake, naturally) as to who this boring killer may be; I decided half-way through the film that it must be the black cameraman. Why? Because. No, sorry: that would be a WES CRAVEN EXPLANATION. I can do better than that... Here's why the black guy should be the killer:1) He would be the first black killer in a slasher film (or?), and this would have been terribly original in Craven's book.2) He was the film's comic-relief (and a very unfunny one, by the way).3) It actually fits in neatly with a couple of scenes in the film.& most importantly:4) He has no motive whatsoever.Alas, Craven decides that one of the two killers, the student, has a motive which is ten times more ridiculous than any I have ever witnessed in any film before, and ten times less of a motive than any other character in the film had: his motive is his hunger for O.J.-like court-room notoriety and media drama and fame. What does this teach us, that we never knew before? It teaches us that sometimes no motive at all is better than a Wes Craven motive. The absurdity of the other killer, the mother(!) of the murdered killer in the first part, is equally impressive: this woman poses as a TV reporter (why??) (idea stolen from 'Se7en') in the entire film without anyone recognizing her. No one from their small town - and there's half-a-dozen of those idiots hanging around the college and thereabouts - recognized her, apart from Campbell in the final scenes.Then there is the film's finale... If I had any willingness left in me to forgive Craven for some of the many moronisms, it was all but destroyed by this laughable, manic, over-the-top, gab-and-shoot-fest finale which has to be seen to be believed! Horror films and thrillers are infamous and even feared for their awfully dumb endings, but this one surpasses even the most hardened skeptic's expectations. Yes, that's right: it's possibly as dumb as 'Hitcher''s ending. Then we have David Arquette's atrocious acting... When will nepotism finally become punishable by electrocution in Hollywood?! This guy, apart from looking like a total loser, is the KING OF ALL OVER-ACTORS and hasn't got a clue what it means to act out a scene and not grimace his way through a scene as though to show the director your latest Beverly Hills facial aerobics exercises. (Craven must have gotten a threesome with the Arquette sisters in return for putting their brother in a major film.)But we have to give Craven some credit, though: the service he provided the black culture in America by finally slaughtering blacks in a slasher film, is immeasurable. Hip hop hooray. Craven is an ACLU hero!But the heaviest criticism is not that he is a commercial director, or that he works with lousy scripts, or that the plot is laughable, or that he is self-indulgent... No. It's that he is predictable. This film is in fact just that. There were at least half-a-dozen scenes which were predictable from the moment they began; it was always obvious who'd get killed and who'd escape, and sometimes even how. A sequel will be coming to cinemas near you, as soon as Craven and his gang of idiots think of a way of having even more absurd killers and even dumber motives.Here are a few suggestions for 'Scream 3' (& 4,5,6...):1) The Killer: The great-grandfather of the murdered mother (in 'Scream 2') of her murdered son ('Scream'), who lived on Mars and decided to go back to Earth after following the events in the previous two films.His Motives: revenge, plus the fact that Martians threatened to kill him if he didn't amuse them by doing something violent on Earth. 2) The Killer: The great-great-great-grandfather of the killer in 'Scream 3', who lived on Jupiter, and decided to go back to Earth after following the events in the previous three films.His Motives: revenge, plus the fact that Jupiterians made him do it to prove that an Earthling can amuse them as well as he can amuse the Martians (who are their rivals for rule over that asteroid belt).3) The Killers: all the innocent people in the previous four parts. They kill only Neve Campbell, proving once again that Craven can still think of original plots: having a dozen people kill one person, instead of the other way around. Isn't it brilliant!?Their Motives: jealousy and anger over the fact that while all of them got injured and some even crippled through the series, she got away from all the violence with only minor bruises.The Reason: Neve wants to finally get out of the series.

Dark Shadows," Was this an autobiographical movie by Tim? Is this about the spell cast on him to marry Helena Bonham Carter?
","Quite a depressing prologue for a comedy, huh? Burton has talent to spare in the visual department but he still gets confused about the basics. He should have gone either for a comedy - a spoof of the vampire genre - or for a horror story.'It is said that blood is thicker than water,' says Depp in the prologue and the epilogue. Well, blood IS thicker than TALENT – that much is certain - at least in nepotism-encased, in-bred, elitist Hollywood. Hell-ena Bonham Carter is the great-granddaughter of no less than a former British Prime Minister and has a movie director in her corrupt lineage as well (no doubt a career handed to him on a plate by his famous head-of-state relative), whereas Eva Green's mother was a French movie actress. Both of them suck, and I don't mean blood.Aside from dazzling visuals and occasionally original movies (though quite a few duds as well), Tim Burton has been displaying two other very obvious traits over the course of his career: one very positive, one very negative. The Positive: casting Depp for most of his movies. The Negative: casting his useless wives in all of his movies. Will Angelique Bouchard please be of some use finally and throw a curse at the Burton-Bonham marriage? As long as these two are married (and God only knows what accursed spell was thrown onto poor gullible Tim to make him fall in love with the blue-blooded little English goblin), he will keep on casting Hell-ena in EVERY single damn movie he makes. Angelique, you bloody witch, how about making him drink Love Potion no. 8 – the one that makes nerds fall in love with a hot new actress such as Amanda Crew (for example)? That would significantly improve his love-life, but much more importantly it would finally remove the dreary-looking, overrated cartero-bon(dis)harmonious Orc from all his future projects.Is Eva Green supposed to be some kind of a sex-kitten? For all those of you who have seen her walk around butt-naked in 'Dreamers' – a movie for which she agreed to degrade herself like a jackass hooker for Bertolucci – she has (or had) a spectacular set of knockers, but her face leaves much to be desired. At best, she is pretty-ish, at worst (when she smiles ear-to-ear for example, like some Julia Roberts demon) she's hideous. Burton could have hired a far more competent and sexy actress for this role, but I guess he has become a Hollywood elitist himself, what with marrying 'blue-blooded' princesses and the like. Eva's role is anyway a fairly simple affair; mugging and overacting is needed in abundant supply, which Eva provides, albeit in mediocre fashion.I know this is just a comedy-horror fairy tale, but giving the witch THIS much power? There must be some sort of a 'silly horror flick superpowers limit' as to how much magic one witch can wield. Eva Green is given so much power that realistically she should have been ruling the world by the time Depp's 196-year imprisonment ended, not some meaningless little fishing hamlet. What would a witch want with fish, anyway? If it's money she's after, she should have become the female Bill Gates. Nor did I understand why Depp didn't immediately get on with killing Green as soon as he was released from captivity – rather than wait like a moron until she very predictably struck again.I do expect some semblance of logic even from a movie such as this. However, Burton quite clearly pays little or no attention to such details.Depp is terrific as the vampire, and gets nearly all the laughs – most of which are located in the first half of the movie. The segment during which Depp discovers his New World dominates the movie in quality, although to be fair the visual quality is so high that it alone makes the movie very watchable even during its weaker moments – such as Eva Green overacting and grinning hideously or that embarrassingly cheesy Alice Cooper segment.",Null,0,1,9 December 2014
WALL·E," Obese viewers might fidget nervously in their seats.
","The setting is the not-so-distant future. The problems of pollution and garbage disposal have spiraled out of control. Earth has turned into a hostile environment in which only robots and cockroaches can survive. (No, I'm not referring to Al Gore and Sean Penn...) The remainder of humankind leaves the planet, launching itself into space. (No, not the vast realms of empty space in Susan Sarandon's head.) Many centuries later, and the humans on the spaceship have evolved into a highly sophisticated, vigorous race of self-indulgent pigs. (Yes, a world of Beth Dittos.) It's up to a couple of robots to teach the ex-humans to stand up on their pudgy little feet again...'Pixar' once again affirms its total dominance in the field. Every release is better than the one before it, both visually and conceptually. That other company, the dump that without a hint of irony calls itself 'DreamWorks', cannot hope to ever reach the levels of visual excellence or good script-writing that their main rivals have reached - i.e. had reached a long time ago. The best animated 'DreamWorks' produce is far worse than the weakest that 'Pixar' had ever done. 'Shrek', 'Antz' and 'Madagascar' - just to name a few - combine to show a textbook example of a company's (creative) failure to compete with its superior rivals. (The immense commercial success of this garbage company stems from the fact that fans of 'Shrek' are much like the chunky, semi-daft humanoids that inhabit Eve's spaceship - already quite a few of those!) Not entirely surprising, given the fact that His Royal Tinseltownic Highness The Master Schmaltz-Maker Steven Spielberg co-founded it. Of course it was going to suck! Whatever Spielberg's greedy little fingers touch nearly always amounts to nothing.Apart from the excellent visuals, the solid gags, and the likable characters (even the humanoid swine are made out to be likable), 'Wall-e' has the advantage of having a peculiar and refreshing distinction: because there is very little real dialogue, there are practically no annoying familiar actors' voices to be heard. Apparently, Sigourney Weaver lends her voice to someone, something or other, but I hadn't even noticed it. In other words, no Tom Hanks, no Mike Myers, no Cameron Diaz... a welcome relief. Most lines consist of 'Wall-e!!!!' and 'Eve...?' - and that's just fine as it is.How do overweight people watch this film? I guess 'Pixar' must have consciously gone the risk of alienating at least a fifth of its potential viewership. Nevertheless, they landed another hit. Could it be that overweight people didn't recognize themselves on the screen? And why was there no organization called The Anti-Defamation Of Fatties League protesting outside of America's cinemas?",Null,3,8,16 August 2009
Arrival," A bunch of octopussies travel all the way to Earth just to give us a riddle.
","Usually a bad movie is either boring or stupid. This flick manages to connect a bridge between the two, accomplishing what only a select few bad movies have done before. Congrats, Villeneuve. If I used to be 99% sure I'll never watch your awful Blade Runner 'sequel', now I am 100% sure of it.These 'superior aliens' are so inept and disorganized that they didn't even have the basic common sense to first LEARN an Earth language - ANY language (Swahili if need be) - BEFORE landing with 12 egg-shaped hover-crafts on Earth, scaring the bejesus out of everyone. Surely these 'superior' aliens (let's call them squiddies) are smart enough to realize that Earthlings are deeply divided, paranoid, dumb and easily frightened. No? Well, in that case the squiddies are daft too, and that means the whole movie falls apart because its fundamental premise of a superior alien race doesn't hold water. Speaking of water, they look like octopus. OK, fine: better than skinny bug-eyed big-headed generic anal-probing Area 51 type of green lizards, but hardly original or menacing or interesting. And the squiddies fire black ink too: what is this, a comedy? Is the fact they're octopussies the reason why they got along so well with girl-power girl?I commend the film for not making this yet another absurd U.S.-centric invasion flick in which only Americans make decisions, where EVERYTHING revolves around the White House. Admittedly, Americans save the day - again - but at least it's not JUST about the Americans. But the way the movie goes about making this a global invasion is just embarrassing; it's pedestrian, utterly unrealistic. In essence, the best minds in TWELVE (read: 12) countries are working on this mystery, and yet the ONLY person who makes any significant progress is a linguist professor at some rinky-dink U.S. college where 5 kids show up to class. And when she finally makes a large breakthrough, those same government hotshots who trusted her and hired her aren't that interested in what she's got to say. Really? The film is trying to tell me that China and Russia are so trigger-happy that they can hardly wait to attack a species that is so advanced that humans couldn't even figure out how they communicate between their 12 ships. Humans couldn't even figure out what the ships were made of! Yet they wanted to nuke them. WITHOUT being attacked first. It's so idiotic, you need be a fan of 'Armageddon' to believe any of this malarkey.The film is somewhat 'serious' science-wise - at least until the story turns all stephenkingsian on us by unloading a huge psychic turdcake under our collective noses. Suddenly Louise reads the future! Why? How? Why her? What about the Russian and Chinese counterparts? Was the Sudanese girl-power linguist expert not competent enough to learn this 'time language'? Did the Pakistani girl-power linguist not try hard enough? Was she a lot less smart? Lazier? What?... Sure, whatever. It's Hollywood 2016 i.e. it has to be dumb.Louise's sudden psychic powers are explained by her learning this 'time language'. Her theory that learning a language changes how you think was far-fetched enough as it is, but acceptable. They had to go a step further, however, and introduce this ludicrous premise that there is a language that makes you... see the future? I know this is sci-fi (well... soppy chick-flick sci-fi) but this is just too silly.I also struggle with this laughable idea that aliens come here just to give us a puzzle to solve.'We came here to help you, BUT you have to first solve an incredibly difficult puzzle. Failure to solve it could have disastrous consequences and actually ruin you more than help you, but we are willing to take that chance because we love playing around funny guessing games involving ink with inferior clowns such as yourself.'By the time the movie had already spent HALF-AN-HOUR on humans trying to communicate with squiddies, I was getting impatient, figuring 'well, the film's gotta move on soon, can't be possibly ALL about this linguistic riddle nonsense'. Oh yes, it can! The entire movie is about this puzzle-solving drivel and those boring meetings between the romantic couple and squiddies! Nothing else. In fact, there are 37 of these meetings and I'm just thankful that Villeneuve decided to show us 'only' 6-7 of those. (Feels like 15-20, but that's just me.)The 'future flashbacks' concerning her daughter are so very boring, mushy and visually flat, I wanted to fast-forward them: they look like shampoo commercials. In fact, my finger was nervously circling the FF button during the entire movie. I felt like I'd spent an entire day watching this dreary nonsense.Get this: Louise has a child with lover-boy DESPITE knowing her daughter will die in her teens!!! Kinda defeats the whole purpose of HAVING premonition, doesn't it? 'Well, done, girl-power girl! You have obtained the power to see the future. Now feel free to not use it by not avoiding major mistakes such as giving birth to faulty kids'. Un-be-lieveable. Some people actually find this TOUCHING, INSPIRING even. Say what? Obviously people who agree with her decision don't have children of their own.I also have to mention how unconvincing and dumb the notion of a benevolent alien race is. Look, I like octopussies as much as the next person, but the idea that a superior alien race is this NICE to us for no real reason than because they have great etiquette and a perfect moral compass, is asinine. It is actually possible to make movies with goody aliens, but it's very difficult to make them convincing and intelligent.The incessant MUMBLING of the entire cast doesn't help either. These thespians hadn't even learned to SPEAK, yet they'd been cast in a big-budget film about a linguistic expert trying to solve a language riddle. Kind of ironic.",Null,5,15,24 July 2018
The Conjuring," Satan cannot be happy with this demon's efforts.
","I love the movie's epilogue: 'Diabolical forces are formidable. These forces are eternal, and they exist today. The fairy tale is true. The devil exists. Oprah exists. God exists. And for us, as people, our very destiny hinges upon which we elect to follow: Oprah or God.' So simple, yet so true.I also very much enjoyed the movie's prologue: 'This movie is based on a true story – as true as anything that guy with the funny hair tells you on ANCIENT ALIENS.'For those of you who were a little bored with 'A Haunting in Connecticut', rest assured that TC is much better. While not always gripping, the movie is never dull, with a good flow, some interesting scenes, and with yet another demonic failure. 'Diabolical forces are formidable' the movie confidently claims. But are they really? This witch-demon wasn't able to kill a single character, not even any of the 6 girls all of whom should have been easy targets; there were over a dozen people milling about both haunted houses and yet the demon just couldn't get his act together, failing time and time again. And what a poor shot! Even using a gun at close range against civilians was too much for this witch hell-beast. Eventually, all it took to beat the demon was an amateur non-priest improvising a little with the Bible, in what was admittedly a hotly contested exorcism with a lot of broken furniture and plenty of screaming.I have to address this demon's incompetence further. She had 103 years to wreck havoc on humanity, but all she managed was to kill a handful of people. Given Warren's cute analogy of demons 'latching on like a stepped-on chewing-gum', and given the witch's enormous power, why hasn't she overtaken the entire American continent by 1971? Give me half her power, and I would rule the world within a week (if I were so inclined). Satan needs to send these demons to better training courses, because some of them just aren't doing too well in possession and murdering people.That Warren couple must be a real piece of work, forging a decades-long career out of utter bull's dung. Well done; many a charlatan had their career cut short by prison-sentences, but this pair found a way to con the easily 'connable' and even made money giving lectures at Universities about phony-baloney ghosts and goofy exorcisms. Still, they were useful in one way: a solid horror film was made about them, though not EXACTLY in keeping with the actual facts, perhaps straying just a little bit from the truth, say maybe 180 degrees, but no more than that.There was some illogical nonsense, as always. When Lili Taylor witnesses pictures falling from the wall, NO-ONE in the house is woken by the massive racket, nor are they woken by the slamming of the cellar doors. Quite preposterous, considering that all five of her kids were in the house during this noisy ordeal. Also moronic was the fact that Ed Warren didn't lock the room in which he kept all those (allegedly) dangerous items, an omission that allowed his young daughter to rummage around in it, exposing the family to various 'genies-in-the-bottles' who could come out and wreck havoc – and one of them did. When Warren finds his daughter hiding in the forbidden room, he gently pats her on the cheek instead of smacking her one real hard so she'd never again be tempted to conjure hell-fire demons from the deepest corners of Gahanna.I was baffled by the pair's decision to head straight for the haunted house, just minutes after saving their daughter's life – leaving her in the same house in which she'd been terrorized just a bit earlier! But I guess one has to be a properly trained DEMONOLOGIST in order to understand all the fine intricacies and nuances of demon-control and behavior of Satan's minions. Who am I to question the decision of such a renowned scientist?Still, we should consider ourselves lucky that Wan only directed TC, considering he's the guy who wrote one of the stupidest scripts of all time ('Saw'). TC would have been a very dumb movie had he chosen to write it up as well.",Null,1,6,30 December 2013
Prometheus," Budapest, Turkey - on a new moon.
","Weird intro a violent demise intriguing so far so good (although we never find out this scene's relevance) an obviously nepotistic couple holding hands, like some wide-eyed teens, inspecting some gobbledygook alien-contact cave-drawings not good but acceptable; this is sci-fi after all i.e. BS is allowed not quite sure how they found this star-system based on these vague little kiddie-scribbles; it's hardly a map to uncle Bob's next-door garage let alone to a distant planet... 4 years later, a squeaky-clean ship (not adhering to Lucas's 'used universe' approach) is sent to look for our 'makers' Darwin's out the window, defeated by the superior intellect of a Hollywood writer the producers/writers/liars of 'Ancient Aliens' would whole-heartedly support this, but this IS a sci-fi flick, so I won't complain A cheesy android who looks like a young SS officer manages the ship fine why not But who's in charge?... Oh no Ohhhhh nooooNot Charlize! The same woman who thinks that Budapest is in Turkey, the same blond bimbo who mugged her way through 'Monster', and that poses with Mandela just so she could lend herself 'seriousness' i.e. escape her ex-starlet bimbo image - is in charge of a one-trillion-dollar space-exploration expedition. Ridley, have you lost your mind? I'd rather see Captain Pickard's testicles run this ship – and he's a bloody bald pacifist. OK, fine so Ms. Theron, who looks like a High School dropout, is the boss sort of; there seem to be 5 different crew-members calling the shots here: 'The couple is in charge, but so is my daughter, and the Captain, AND me the aging loopy bastard later on' Who's the captain?... The black guy, who looks like he arrived straight from football practice... Oh, brother, this is starting to approach Avatar/Sunshine/Armaggedon-like levels with leaps and bounds But is the rest of the crew similarly balmy? Yuuuup The annoying/unappealing couple who found the cave-drawings was actually invited, no clue why(superstition? duh) The others aren't any better; some of the crew look/behave/talk like a bunch of young MTV slackers from '16 & Pregnant'... Ridley might as well have cast the 'Jackass' bunch as these 'astronauts' I see neither scientists nor astronauts here; I do see however a bunch of (mostly lame) actors lost within the confines of a shitty/confused script directed by a once-worthy director The silliest one is Red-Beard who 'came just to make money' Oh no, that reeks of crap; I bet he'll do and say many dumb things in the course of this flick Predictably, he dies first, leaving him little time to 'shine'...I was right: Red-Beard is yowling like a wolf as they enter the cave Perhaps prolonged cryogenic sleep turns adults into imbeciles?... Minutes pass What's he doing now? He is suddenly terrified because of the dead alien body?... Is he actually shouting, throwing a hissy-fit?... Evidently, Ridley didn't deem it necessary to have either an intelligent/mature-behaved crew nor to have psycho-tests for space-travelers prior to sending them on mega-expensive missions... I guess such evaluations had lost their usefulness by 2091: everyone in this future is calm, rational and smart – as is so plainly obvious from the moronic/immature behavior of nearly everyone involved in the mission'The most significant discovery in the history of mankind,' lover-boy says. But do the rest of the crew share his very understandable enthusiasm? Hardly; most of these 'astronauts' seem positively bored, as if finding ancient aliens is part of their daily routine. I was half-expecting to see them yawn. The Captain even looks bemused half the time, grimacing, as if treating the mission like some sort of in-joke. Absolutely retarded.Next up, the examination of the alien head Suddenly, that fish-faced nepotistic anthropologist is a medical expert as well Hooray for feminism!... Or not (I was hooraying too early): sheesh, the two women managed to blow the head up into bits after mere minutes So much for girl-power And what's Charlize doing? Anything meaningful? No: she is striking poses, as usual, her uselessness as a character is becoming ever-more apparent She looks more like a sex-kitten/ship-mascot/eye-candy-for-the-viewers than someone in charge of anything What's this? She is acting all tough, threatening the vastly superior android? The tough-chick shtick did not work even when she played a serial-killer - let alone as a cat-walk(ing) astronaut, where this Budapest-fumbling Turkey-challenged blond may as well be a piece of furnitureSo let me get this straight: two men are stranded on the surface (stupidly splitting up from the main group), but the Captain would rather shtoop Charlize than look out for their safety on his pyramid-hologram thing? Wow And THIS is the guy who saves us all eventually?!... In the meantime, the boring in-love-couple are also shtooping. It's one big shtoop-o-rama on this trillion-dollar mission. They have nothing better to do on a fascinating new world where they'd just discovered aliens; Noomi is getting all teary-eyed when the subject of having kids comes up. Ridley, you ought to have your director's license revoked Red-Beard and his sidekick see a cobra-like creature not cute in the slightest; menacing more than anything But they wanna PLAY with it And then predictably die in true slapstick fashion. Was Ridley shooting a sci-fi/horror comedy?'I need to visit their planet, find out why they'd changed their minds, decided to destroy us,' says the amphibian-faced actress picked here just because her parents are successful show-biz people, in her obviously phony English accent. The answer is as obvious as Danny de Vito's bald head: mankind had turned 'Avatar' into the biggest commercial success ever, so obviously our bald-headed makers were disappointed and upset with us.

1408," Am I hallucinating or is it Cusack? A good movie based on King's material??
","This is one of the most fun horror films to come out in recent years. Set mostly in a hotel suite, it is never dull, slickly directed, and a great ride. There are even a twist or two, which is amazing considering that King, the King of Predictability, wrote the story this is based on.This is only the second time - since Kubrick's phenomenal 'The Shining' - that a movie based on a Stephen King book or story turns out very good. It took nearly three decades for it to happen, but here it is. My guess is that the story was re-written in a major way (that is to say improved), and/or that the script-writer is very bright i.e. capable of turning crap into gold, which is a rare talent.Take a look at Mary McCormack's new lips. She looks like a frog. Her plastic surgeon should have his license revoked.",Null,1,2,28 September 2007
Blade Runner," Not for the brain-dead.
","Possibly the best sci-fi movie of all time, and one of the very best in any genre. From whichever angle one looks at it, it is almost flawless. The mood created here by the sublime soundtrack (that fits to this film like a child-molestation lawsuit to Michael Jackson), the sets, and the photography, presented something utterly new when the movie came out, and the film hasn't been rivaled since. Like Scott's previous sci-fi hit, 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' has been often copied with pathetic results. There is a certain melancholy about the movie that is hard to describe, in spite of being a sci-fi thriller. The cast is terrific, especially Rutger Hauer who is just perfect as the short-lived android. The scene at the end between Ford and Hauer, when the latter spares the former's life, is one of the most powerful ever filmed. (Anyone who has seen the film and yet doesn't understand what I mean by this can't be helped.) The story is intelligent, thought-provoking just as true science fiction should be. And yet, the movie is based on a book by an overrated writer, Philip K.Dick! It's a bit ironic, but a similar thing happened when Kubrick turned King's trashy novel 'Shining' into a brilliant horror film. Yes, movies can turn crap into gold, don't ask me how. Kubrick and Scott are some sort of alchemists...The Director's Cut I haven't seen yet. It lacks the narration and has a more ambiguous ending.",Null,2,5,9 August 2007
Signs," M. Nightmare Sharlatan runs over Mel's wife so Mel takes revenge by turning in a truly bad performance.
","Mel tries so hard to play some imagined stereotype of what a small-town, uptight Protestant priest is supposed to be like that he ends up acting like a robot. A robot with the occasional sob-attack. Badly miscast. But what could have we expected from a director who considers Phoenix and Adrien Brody great actorsMel cries on several occasions and it's nothing less than comical. MNS is a BAD director. He doesn't have a clue how to cast his movies, nor does he recognize situations in which actors make jackasses of themselves, thereby stretching the (intelligent) viewer's patience.Hmm Mel is a staunch Catholic in real life. Perhaps he made the Protestant priest look foolish on purpose?... Nothing about this devious anti-Semite would surprise me anymore.Interspersed in-between all the x-file-ish malarkey are idiotic 'cute'- meant-to-be-funny comic-relief scenes like the astoundingly silly '3 to 2' vote, or Gibson vs. rest of family. That's straight out of a failed Saturday Night Live sketch.Speaking of his dull family, that son A typical Hollywood-movie kid: a 225 I.Q. Yet where did he get that intelligence from? Mel the priest?? Perhaps Mom had a fling with a nuclear scientist while Mel was busy talking to God There is nothing wrong with intelligent kids as such, but it does start to get very irritating when 9 out of 10 directors opt for the 'ultra-bright brat' cliché. This movie could really have used a dose of realism; by portraying a normal kid, i.e. one who doesn't act and talk like an adult, this would have been one small but wise step towards that. The kid dishes out advice like Oprah Winfrey on speed, and reveals a vocabulary larger than Mark Twain's, while he quotes Dr.Bimbu's idiotic book.Dr.Bimbu. With 'Signs', MNS has stepped into the retarded realm of the many charlatans, liars, and other esoteric witch-doctors of this idiotic New Age. Everything 'Penn & Teller' would label as '100% B.S.' MNS will eventually stick into his increasingly absurd movies, trying to sell it as science rather than sheer mindless fun. Thereby, MNS has willfully joined the dumbing-down, anti-science bandwagon. Whether that is due to stupidity or greed isn't even relevant. 'Signs' is yet another in a plethora of high-profile contributions towards turning us all into morons. But must we all end up like Sean Penn? Screw Dr.Bimbu.Speaking of modern-day myths for gullible, miracle-hungry fools, why would any advanced and hostile alien civilization make those damn silly Crap Circles? 'Greetings, Earthmen. We're trying to hide from you, hence avoid jeopardizing our plans for attack, but here are a few 200-meter- long clues we left lying around for you to muse over, just for the fun of it' 'The nerds were right', says ne'er-too-bright, bat-waving Phoenix. I suppose that MNS – being a mega-nerd himself – wanted nerds to be taken more seriously, especially when they drool over silly UFO theories. But he made a slight mistake, the confused man that he is: those are morons, not nerds.A news announcer tells us in all honesty: 'What you are about to see may upset you.' So what happens? What is this horrible Shyamalayian sight that might twist our stomachs into knots? A GREEN B-MOVIE ALIEN. Either that or an emaciated Sasqwatch. Ed Wood's influence has always been totally under-appreciated.The alien attack has just been repelled, yet all bunny-lipped Phoenix wants to do is talk to Mel about his 'loss of faith'. So Hollywood Pathetic, soppy family drama with touches of 'uplifting' religious re- awakening baloney, serving as a substitute for originality or interesting plot-twists. Spiffing.Was Phoenix's miraculous 'girlfriend vomits during kissing' anecdote lifted from 'South Park'? Anything else M. Night Sharlatan wants to admit to have stolen from other TV shows and other movies?...'Signs' is a poor man's 'Independence Day': focus on just one family and one house (i.e. an inexpensive setting), and you don't have to spend tons of money on special effects. Save the little money you have (after having paid a fortune to Mel for a truly bad performance) on the one or two shoddy-looking green aliens. Even the two lethargic catatonics in 'X-Files' would have been embarrassed to play opposite such dumb spielbergian outer-space twits.In a way I was saddened by the failed invasion attempt. A victory by the bug-eyes would have meant no more MNS movies, and not a single additional turd by Emir Kusturica or Spike Lee.H20 as a skin-melting acid? MNS re-writes some basic laws of chemistry, not just physics and interstellar space-travel.But if you thought this MNS movie was a turkey, just check out 'The Happening'So why are nearly all movie aliens NAKED? We LIVE on Earth and yet we need clothes, but outer-space mongrels with utterly different biological set-ups just come here and prance around in the nude as if they'd been here for aeons.Sharlatan kills his aliens with water, Spielberg (of 'War of the Worlds' fame) executes them with the swine flu. It's only a matter of time until Robert Rodriguez comes up with aliens even dumber than these. How will Hollywood's next alien invasion abruptly end? Will they die from AIDS because they're all gay? Will they flee in terror after watching an episode of 'Ally McBeal'? Or will humans discover telepathy and send those deadly Paris Hilton brainwaves into the alien invaders' collective heads?",Null,6,11,13 October 2009
X2: X-Men United," Magneto: my hero.
","This near-feminist weak sequel to the rather average first installment left me in tears... of boredom and laughter. The two don't normally go hand-in-hand, but the impossible CAN happen. The impossible (or shall I say absurd) as in Stewart having such enormous powers that he can kill all mankind with thought alone. Wow. How bombastic can you get. But the really silly bit is that this all-powerful Stewart - realistically speaking powerful enough to be mistaken for God - is so easily manipulated to do things against his will, such as kill all humans. So the merry band of X-Women had to prevent ALL of mankind getting annihilated. Even James Bond's missions don't get this silly.It seems that nearly everyone's powers have quadrupled, at the very least, since the first movie. (I was even half-expecting the U.S. President to turn someone to stone or spew fire out of his ears.) Especially the female cast, which dominates here. But I guess in the laughable 'girl power' (or 'fashion-model power') age that we live in, what with all the Kill Bills, Death-Proofs, Ripleys, and other Lara Crofts, I should have by now gotten used to the fact that anorexic 6-foot super-models save entire galaxies in adventure films. (Just how do you get the energy to kill so many evil guys while boycotting food, i.e. starving?? I don't get it...) It is just sooooo convincing to watch an Uma Thurman chop-sokey 70 Japanese martial arts experts in one evening. It makes Bugs Bunny cartoons look like 'Les Miserables'.I'm all for wild fantasy, but there are limits as to how dumb an action movie can get before it becomes a parody of itself.Given the tremendous powers that Xavier and his goodie-two-shoes 'mutants' have, how can the U.S. military, or for that matter, ALL of the world's military powers combined, do them any harm? Comic-book kiddy rubbish or not - that cannot be an all-purpose excuse here - even fantasy has to adhere to some form of logic and common-sense, especially the kind of fantasy that tries to make 'relevant' political and social comments, thinly disguised in 'mutant' (uni)form.Apart from the ridiculous premise, we also have some Latin soap-opera romance going, in the form of a love-triangle (Wolverine, Cyclops & Jean Grey), and even puppy-love (Rogue and Iceman; I feel so silly even writing these names down...). Hence it's no wonder that the movie overstretches its welcome by at least 40 minutes, what with its whopping 130 minutes running time. There is very little going on in the first half-hour, which was particularly dull. The love-triangle implodes when Famke Janssen dies at the end. Was this supposed to be a touching/emotional moment? I yawned. Just check out Jackman's/Wolverine's unconvincing sobbing; but, hey, it's tough to act when you're in front of a damn blue screen all the time. And I guess in the third part we'll have Wolverine falling in love with Cyclops, right? Maybe as a little nod of approval to the gay community... And the less said about all those mutant kids being in the movie, the better... Dull props, nothing more.One of the dumbest things in this lame sequel is Alan Cummings. He would have been bad enough in any human role here, but as a mutant? And a German mutant?? A German, Christian-fanatic mutant??? Cummings' accent reminded me of Sascha Cohen's gay Austrian Bruno character from his Ali G show. Almost as bad is Mystique (what a dumb dumb dumb name), who is given the ol' switcheroo shtick, so very much milked dry in about half of all 'Star Trek' episodes. So she can transform into anyone? With that power she doesn't need either 'God' or Magneto (another dumb name) to rule the world - all by herself! This kind of nonsense may look good to nerdy zit-faced pre-teens when offered in comic-book form, but on the screen it's just all far too silly. As most Marvel film adaptations are. Still, it isn't nearly as bad as Ang Lee's 'Hulk'...I am really looking forward to seeing the sequel! In it, I expect to see our X-Women powerful enough to make the Sun circle the Earth, maybe Neptune and Jupiter will be smashed together as one, and maybe Famke Janssen will re-surface as a sort of quasi-goddess, who gets jealous of Wolverine and Cyclops for getting a gay marriage license. She will then join Magneto and destroy the whole universe. All of these powers are merely a result of 'human evolution', of course I am really, really looking forward to the third part. I have a copy of it, I just need to place it in the DVD. But some magic power is preventing me from it... Could it be...? Could it be Magneto? Maybe he doesn't want me to trash his precious mutants in yet another, third, review...",Null,3,9,16 October 2007
Final Destination," Starts very well, but gets a little too silly toward the end.
","A minor SPOILER here.A very good premise that gradually - and inevitably - drifts into teen horror film territory. I say inevitably because there is a group of teens involved so obviously there can be no long-term seriousness. Still, I was a little surprised just how unseriously the movie ends. When one compares the excellent beginning with the ridiculous horror/comedy ending, it is like looking at two different movies. It's a pity that the premise wasn't taken and 'assigned' to a cast of adults, i.e. that a 'serious' horror film wasn't made. Nevertheless, FD is never dull; even the obviously weaker second half. The flight disaster scenes are terrific, the murder scenes are very good, and there is real interest as to what is going to happen next, in spite of a premonition that the conclusion can't and won't be satisfactory. The conclusion is almost like a mockery of all the previous happenings (the movie turns from horror into the horror comedy genre). Easily the dumbest scene, however, isn't the ending but the way the aggressive teen turns around his car to beat up the movie's main hero, and nearly kills the bicycle-driving teen - while completely ignoring the fact that he nearly killed him and caused an accident! That was really, really dumb.",Null,6,10,10 October 2007
300," A straight-forward movie with plenty of testosterone. NOT an invitation to invade 21st-century Iran.
","Regarding the criticism of this movie, much of it seems to stem from Iranians, but also whining liberals and other anti-war Utopians who claim that this is a pro-war/pro-Bush movie. (I wish it were! ALL recent political Hollywood films are anti-Bush.) To actually take a story such as this, based on a comic-book - regardless of the historical aspect which is almost irrelevant here, used just as a backdrop - and find right-wing political propaganda in it is tantamount to taking one's own paranoia and elevating it to the level of godhood. This is just a fun action-fantasy yarn. Bleedin'-heart leftists need to take their medication, i.e. calm their fragile nerves. To all of you who see Bush in every bush, a piece of advice: do not nurture your paranoia with such tender-loving care. Give it a rest now and again. Wake up and smell the real world around you. The way to succeed in this is to just say no to drugs (apart from the prescribed medication for left-wing paranoiacs) and Michael Moore...I loved the unique visual look of the movie; unlike most sci-fi or fantasy spectacles today where blue/green dominate, here we have plenty of gray, a refreshing change. The machismo wasn't pathetic or stereotypical, but seemed raw, and VERY fortunately there were no effeminate girls like Brad Pitt, Di Crapio, Ryan Philippe, Tobey Maguire, Jack Gyllenhaal, Tom Cruise or Matt Damon to dilute that aspect hence making a joke of the whole movie in the process. Any of these guys is perfect for playing gay cowboys, and one of them even has, but please keep these pansies away from movies about men. Real men were cast here to play real men  which is nowadays not only NOT standard practice, but has become as rare as Tim Robbins's brain cells. This was crucial. With a different kind of casting this would have been just another 21st-century big-budget Hollywood piece of crap. To be more precise, I thought that the casting of Gerard Butler did the movie tons of good. I've never seen him before nor even heard of him. Not only was he credible as the ultimate alpha male leader, but I liked his mannerisms and the way he spoke. Occasionally he reminded me of Mel Gibson, for some reason, although his presence is far greater than Mel's. (Mel tends to be a giggling buffoon too often.)My favourite line in the movie was when Leonidis quipped 'We've been sharing our culture with you all morning' (to Xerxes).The battle scenes were very stylish. There was a certain elegance in the way the 300 cut their enemies into little pieces  and I hope I don't sound like a psychopath here. I wasn't too surprised that this director did such a good job with the film. I saw his 'Dawn of the Dead', a horror-movie remake; that movie also had some rather memorable action sequences, especially very early on.As far as the non-battle scenes are concerned, I would say the most enjoyable ones were Leonidis's first encounter/dialogue with Xerxes, and the moment when the former's wife stabs the Spartan traitor in the Council (that was totally unexpected). A good aspect was that the movie was so simple plot-wise. No unnecessary bla-bla, because this is not the kind of movie where that would have been suitable. It is straight-forward, just like the attitude/mind-set of the 300.",Null,1,4,27 August 2007
Easy A," Emma Stone is very cute and she tries hard, but there is only so much juice you can squeeze out of a dried-up lemon of a script.
","I don't normally watch modern teen comedies, in fact almost never, but a very good cast (a rarity these days) attracted me to this movie, and by that I mean Emma Stone and the adult i.e. older actors (apart from Lisa 'Friends' Kudrow). I should have known better. I understand that this is just a mindless teen comedy, but even the lowest-common denominator genres have to subscribe to some level of basic logic and ground rules.1. Stone gets called an 'abominable tramp' during English class, to which she responds by calling the other girl an 'abominable tw*t'. And yet Stone is the only one that gets sent to the principle's office. Duh. 2. Right off the bat Stone is presented to us as a teen of above-average intelligence (which admittedly isn't saying much). In fact, as is typical in these movies, she is given lines of a middle-aged man with 5 university degrees, AND she is full of 5-cent movie 'wisdom'. And yet she agrees to the gay guy's preposterous plea to pretend to have sex with him even though that would clearly only make her phony reputation as an easy lay even worse. We were given to understand that Emma wasn't enjoying that reputation too much, so why the decision? The reason: just so the writer of this lame script could advance his shaky plot. The poor sap couldn't think of a logical way of doing this, so he chose an illogical plot-device. Nice going. 3. 'Everyone claimed they slept with me, but no-one really bothered to actually sleep with me.' (Stone) That's about as dumb as it gets. If your comedy has absolutely zero basis in reality than very little in it will be funny, it's that simple. 4. The writer, probably some middle-aged male, simply projected himself onto Emma's character, a teen, and the result is a girl that doesn't appear even 1% believable, at any point in the movie.Not to mention casting an incredibly geeky, ugly girl to play Emma Stone as a 12 year-old. If only it was meant to be funny, but it wasn't.One of the more annoying aspects of EA were Stone's parents, played by Tucci and Clarkson. Always cracking wise, their totally unrealistic hip-understanding-always-cheerful-intelligent-parents shtick gets old very quickly, as does their almost clownish behaviour. But that's the problem of the whole movie: nothing here has an ounce of realism hence it's hard to either care for the characters or laugh at the gags that seem to get increasingly formulaic as the time drags on (and on).Mocking 'Jesus freaks' is too easy, it's been done so often by Hollywood by now it's hardly interesting anymore. Besides, didn't 'Monty Python's Life of Brian' teach Americans how to do religious satire properly? That must have gone way over their empty heads. These Christian gags are so lame they were more than cringe-worthy.But what could one expect? This director calls up on John Hughes as a major filmic inspiration. But just as 'The Breakfast Club' cannot be enjoyed by anyone older than 18, the same might be true for EA too. (Admittedly, 'Ferris Bueler's Day Off' shouldn't be enjoyed or watched by anyone, regardless of sex or age.) Even more embarrassing is that after all the cardboard, utterly absurd characters and goings-on that EA offers us, suddenly they give us Emma Stone CRYING – as if one hour into this goofy mess we can possibly take anything 'dramatic' that occurs here even half-way seriously. Double-duh. You don't create a cheese-ball comedy environment but then suddenly expect the viewer to take the characters seriously – well, you don't if you're a writer with any amount of common sense.Predictable and obligatory left-wing political correctness is sprayed all over this turkey: the usual pro-gay stuff, 'the only thing that trumps religion is Capitalism' (Stone), Florida being commended for voting for Obama, the school's principal being labeled a 'Fascist' because he doesn't believe in liberally-orientated New Age BS education systems, a black kid being adopted by Tucci and Clarkson, 'the Civil War was just about racism' (Stone), etc. The whole left-wing movie propaganda alphabet, it's all here. Yes, even in a daft teen comedy. They never let up. Ironically, that makes them just as persistent and self-righteous as the 'Jesus freaks' they mock here with such childish gusto. (When are American liberals finally going to smell the roses and realize that religion and their precious Marxism are just two sides of the same smelly coin?) In the end, were it not for Emma Stone being present in nearly every scene, EA could have easily been an unwatchable bomb with no redeeming value whatsoever. It's a pity her films so far have been nearly all garbage. The fact that she seems to be a rising star in Hollywood only means her roles will get even worse. Watch her lift an Oscar in an overrated costume drama, a left-wing propaganda thriller, or a drama about a woman with no legs.On second thought, no. Oscars are awarded nearly always to homely women with nepotist ties.",Null,17,29,16 January 2012
Apollo 13," Raise your hands, all of ye who think that Hanks and Bacon look like astronauts.
","From the man who gave us such crap as the annoying 'EdTV', the indescribably dull 'Cinderella Man', the schmaltzy 'Parenthood', the George-Lucas-wanna-be 'Willow', the Tom-Cruise-sounding-daft-with-an-Irish-accent 'Far And Away', the nonsensical it-has-nothing-to-do-with-the-real-Da-Vinci 'The Da Vinci Code', and the terminally unfunny and unsexy 'Splash', comes the story of three U.S. astronauts who look more like former high-school nerds than real NASA men... If you don't believe me, check out the photos of the actual Lovell, Haise and Swiggert.I heavily question the wisdom of casting Hanks and Bacon as astronauts, since NASA usually chooses real men, not pansies like these two Hollywood phonies. (Even worse, Howard originally wanted John Cusack to be the third astronaut!) If you thought that Buscemi, Willis, and Affleck were stupidly cast in the ultra-moronic 'Armageddon', then check out A13. Not for a second did I manage to suspend my disbelief that Hanks is just Hanks, i.e. the pompous, overrated Hollywood bore, or that Bacon, who is an awful actor in any genre, could be anything but the man who married the 'beautiful' Kyra Sedgwick. Paxton doesn't look anything like an astronaut either, but at least he is a likable presence. Harris is good, but I have to question any director who casts Gary Sinise: this man is one of the most uncharismatic, worst actors in recent years.Ron Howard is infamous for his awful casting choices. I can't think of a single movie he made in which he didn't cast according to his box-office aspirations, rather than according to who suits the roles best. Cash and fame are the sole motivators in his career. Howard is the consummate commercial director, consistently ejecting one mediocrity after another into the already dwindling-quality sub-par world of movies. The fact that his equally greedy and hypocritical Tinseltown peers love him, showering him with those meaningless little golden statuettes, only serves to prove my point.The story is good, but the casting sinks any hopes of this finally reaching the lofty ambitions of Howard: to finally make a movie that is good enough to be considered as average. I also wasn't too thrilled with the visual look of the space scenes; they have a plastic look to them; everything is shining nice and clean, as if Ron was making an AT&T commercial, not a thriller. Howard also fails to recreate that elusive 70s feel.There's a funny moment in 'VIP' ('Very Important Pennis'), in which a mock journalist by the name of Dennis Pennis tells Tom Hanks and Ron Howard the following: 'Tom, you've made the ultimate space movie: completely lacking in atmosphere.' To his credit, Howard laughed.",Null,13,40,8 May 2008
Pineapple Express," Suffers from the modern-comedy virus called 'overthetoppia buffooneris'.
","Yet another comedy that starts well but then cracks at the half-way mark, until it completely disintegrates and degenerates into unfunny slapstick nonsense in its last half-hour, including a typical cop-out action finale that makes Bugs Bunny cartoons look like Discovery documentaries. (OK, perhaps a bad example; Discovery Channel ain't what it used to be.) The immunity to bullets which everyone in the movie has (except the bad guys) is also fairly stupid.Even less funny than the dumb shoot-out was that whole BFF shtick. It was embarrassing to listen to, cringe-worthy even. Very poor writing indeed. Even if you're only 15 you might find it hard to watch.PE starts off as a funny buddy movie, but degenerates into a Vince Vaughn / Ben Stiller-type farce, perhaps even as bad as an Adam Sandler 'comedy'. Another way of explaining this movie's genre confusion: it starts off as 'Midnight Run' (not plot-wise) but ends as 'Naked Gun 4'. This new generation of comedians doesn't even understand the basic rules of film-making, not even Seth who shows a lot of promise (or did show a lot of promise before starting to team up with the likes of Streisand and Diaz, hence joined the trashy commercial mainstream). You choose a comedy form and then you stick with it. What you don't do is start off with a reality-based buddy comedy but then suddenly, without rhyme, reason, cause or explanation (laziness perhaps?) switch to absurdist farce.Besides, there is still a LOT these new kids can learn from the ZAZ team, when it comes to absurdist comedy. One of these things would be that LESS IS MORE, i.e. that you don't milk a gag dry until there's nothing left, especially when it's a dry gag to begin with hence no amount of squeezing helps.",Null,0,2,14 December 2014
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Pretty boys as blood-suckers - could have been much worse.
","Not as bad as I expected - given the lousy, baby-faced cast. Cruise clearly tries his best, but I emphasize - HIS best, which isn't much. Vampire fangs do not belong in the mouth of Cruise - period. Banderas is quite awful, as usual, as another gay-looking, unconvincing vampire, but his first appearance is thankfully reserved for the last third. Slater is fortunately even less present than the Spanish-accented gay vampire. Pitt is okay but looks rather silly with the fangs.The good things about the movie are that it does have elements of originality while most vampire movies do not, and it's never really boring, plus I quite liked the morbidity of little Kirsten Dunst becoming a vampire and forming a strange trio with Pitt and Cruise.

Sin City," Idiotic but relatively fun comic-book nonsense.
","Plot-wise, this is as retarded as it comes. Quite obviously based on a comic-book  and calling it a 'graphic novel' does NOT reduce its stupidity. Even worse, like nearly all comic-book-based movies it is based on US comics, which are the worst. And trust Rodriguez to use the SAME dialog as in the comic-book frames. This guy is a birdbrain, and this kind of vapid content is exactly what you'd expect him to put on the screen. The 3 stories are so full of holes and logic gaps that Superman, Hulk, and others seem like Stephen Hawking by comparison. And how about the comic's author? Well, this guy obviously has a cop-complex, because I have never ever seen this many corrupt cops, politicians and others in a movie before  ever. It would have made better sense to make Sin City a place without relation to the real world, and then a lot would have been forgiven, but making it part of the U.S. (or any real country) shows that Miller is just another dumb Beatnik, born the odd decade too late to participate in 50s Beatnik culture: i.e. shoving into each other their infected genitals and rambling about the world in senseless, silly poetry. Miller is obviously a left-wing moron (although, why add the adjective when it's implied anyway?) and the levels of paranoia he stoops to in his silly little 'graphic novels' is something for a team of shrinks to analyze. On the other hand, shrinks can't improve your I.Q. which is probably why Cruise hates them so much (yes, yes, it's his sect, I know).On the positive side, the cast is good, the visual style is pretty good and quite interesting, and the first story is quite fun. Another proof that Rodriguez isn't all-too bright is the fact that he actually placed the 3 stories in decreasing order of quality. The first story, with Rourke, is by far the best; fast-moving, unpredictable, and comic-book-like, but in a good way. The second story is solid, whereas the last story is by far the worst: totally, utterly idiotic  even for a comic-book movie. Too dumb. The cast: quite a few attractive women, and no silicone implants! Surprising for a dumb director, I must say. It's also amazing that he doesn't have a single ugly talentless actor in there, from the upper tier of Hollywood uglies, i.e. Diaz, Barrymore, Lopez and the other cretins. The male cast is also surprisingly devoid of pansies and other effeminate trollops (you know: Damon, Di Caprio, Bloom, etc.). The only casting decision that really sticks out in its silliness is Wood. I didn't believe FOR A SECOND that Elijah Wood could be a dangerous, acrobatic cannibal. (And soon he will playing Iggy Pop, I hear!!!) As for Rourke, he walks away with the movie, though in all fairness, he got the best part and the best story.All in all, the movie isn't boring (apart from the last story which is a yawnfest of stupidity), and I know that I am supposed to switch off my brain when watching this kind of poppycock, but even comic-based movies ought to have at least an ounce of logic or intelligence. An ounce. Is that asking too much? It is from a Beatnik wannabe, and the dumb director who 'shot and cut' this movie. (Did you know that Rodriguez named his kids Rebel and Rocket???!!! The other two are, I believe, called Road and something else dumb starting with 'R'.)",Null,7,12,6 January 2007
The Cabin in the Woods," If you are an avatard, skip this.
","TCITW is a much-needed refreshment, in a genre that is dominated by clones. It's a sort of tribute to all types of horror films, a semi-parody, and a wild, imaginative, unpredictable ride, all rolled into one. All those who pathetically attempt to trash this film, futilely trying to find something to nitpick about, have to be out of their silly little minds. There are plot-twists, there's an original premise, violence galore, and a wonderful finale. What do you want more? A B-J from the movie? So if you're a deluded creature that is forcing yourself to hate this film just because another great horror film was finally made, and that annoys/upsets you for some reason, be my guest: I can smell your desperation from a thousand miles away. Haters of TCITW are the same people who rank 'Avatar' as a masterpiece.For those of you who knew the essential premise/plot in advance, you only have yourselves to blame; I never watch trailers, nor do I care for the very staged/scripted/moronic interviews with actors/directors while they're hyping flicks, talking about what an 'honor it was to work with him' and about how 'generous' their co-stars were. Hence any movie can surprise me - provided it does actually have surprises. I knew absolutely nothing about TCITW, aside from the spoiler-devoid movie poster and the unusually high IMDb rating (for a horror flick), which actually made me suspect that this might be a major piece of crap, given this site's track-record i.e. taking into consideration how the average movie-going zombie 'thinks' and votes.Even the obligatory comic-relief sidekick isn't half-bad. I can't remember the last time that an annoying buffoonish horror-film clown had an iota of a quality gag coming out of him. This one is interesting and actually serves a purpose in the story. And he doesn't spit one-liners all the time, smirking like a cretin, but actually shows real fear when a situation calls for it.TCITW gets a point off for the absolutely ridiculous wolf-kissing scene, and for including the vastly overrated, amazingly ugly Sigourney Weaver. As if it weren't bad enough that she infested four 'Alien' movies and 'Ghostbusters'. Retire the damn nepotistic 6-foot witch already! Let her play mothers of trolls in half-a**ed fantasy Disney flicks.I would also have edited the movie in such a way as to give the viewer more time to believe that they're actually watching yet another 'Evil Dead' re-hash. The introductory scene with the lab people gives away little, admittedly, serving more to confuse than to reveal anything, but it does hint that the events surrounding the five 'teens' aren't what they seem. I would also have taken out the invisible force-field bird-disintegration scene; that way, when the 'hunk' runs into it his demise would come as a total shock. In fact, I wouldn't have revealed the existence of the underground labs until the first half-hour is over. But this isn't a major criticism; no movie is perfect. There is definite regret that the movie finishes just as the end of the world is starting, but I suppose that something does have to be left to the imagination.",Null,3,11,25 December 2012
Moon," Never make the actor(s) talk over a swinging punching bag. It's irritating.
","Sam Rockwell had annoyed the hell out of me in 'Confessions of a Confused Mind' or 'The Confusions of a Confessed Killer' or 'The Serial Minds of a Confessed Confuser' (or whatever Clooney's first turkey was called), playing his character as if he had graduated from John Travolta's School of Shameless Overacting & Clowning Around, so I was a little wary of watching 'Moon'. However, this being one of few potentially promising sci-fi flicks, I had to give it a try.Fortunately, Rockwell annoys only in a handful of places, as in the scene in which the two clones are having a communication problem due to the fact that the new clone can't keep his hands off a punching bag. It was the punching bag making too much noise - hence not allowing the poor viewer to hear the conversation - that really annoyed me, but that was the director's fault, naturally, not Sam's (for once). Needless to say, Sam was in much safer hands this time around: Clooney seems to have the uncanny 'ability' to bring out the worst in any thespian. Any director is an improvement after George. Any.Actually, can we even consider Clooney a director? 'Moon' is an enjoyable sci-fi drama, a refreshing change from the chop-sokey, space-cadets/marines-going-yo-yeah, monsters-going-ghhrrgaw sci-fi action garbage of recent years. Not all the story elements would survive a closer scrutiny, logic-wise, though. Kevin Spacey, doing the voice of the slightly gay computer, had been programmed to help the clones no matter what. It even allows Sam to re-boot it. Orders coming directly from the company's bosses generally seem to have lower priority: this makes little sense. Also confusing is how the older Sam clone could possibly have had visions of his teenage 'daughter', when he only had memory implants of the time when she was a baby. That would include the supernatural into the equation, but I didn't get the feeling that the writer of 'Moon' was going for that. Still, this one could be explained away...There should have been more shock and disorientation in the way the clones react to each others existence. But even that can be rationalized away through some more-or-less cockamamie genetic-manipulation argument, so I'm fine with that too.Harder to explain would be why the company would go through such lengths - and such risk of having their image ruined/damaged - to create a mini-army of Sam clones instead of hiring normal personnel. The argument that 'clones take away the need to train new employees' seems rather thin, certainly insufficient. The fact that clones don't get paid is also a flimsy reason, considering how little one man would cost as compared to the great deal of profit that must be coming out of this energy-related venture.This begs the question: if this future Earth is so advanced - to the extent that they can make near-perfect clones - then why didn't they just hire robots? That would certainly avoid the additional cost and trouble of sending a repair mission after an aging, dying, very ill clone starts making errors, such as crashing vehicles into expensive machinery. Sam's 3-year expiration date (and I assume it's not controllable) creates hazards every 3 years, right?... So why not replace him every 24 months...Why would they even give the clones memory implants? Why not just make them behave like robots: do your job and shut up.I am also struggling with the fact that a Sam clone could so easily leave the base and fly off to Earth. Wouldn't the company make it impossible for anyone to leave the base without their permission, especially considering the secret they hide on the Moon?Then again, being a mindless sci-fi fan, I am willing to overlook all these Swiss-cheese holes.",Null,3,9,23 March 2010
Contact," A pathetic attempt at doing another, albeit commercial, '2001'.
","'A Robert Zemeckis Film', it says - and it shows. This is one of those movies about which I have so much to write that I don't even know where to begin - and most of it isn't positive.Every time I get bombarded with dozens of idiocies I am forced to do a in-no-particular-order list, and so it is this time, too: 1) A scientist at NASA is the pimpy-looking reggae Rastafarian guy from 'Showgirls'! I was wondering what was next up Zemeckis's sleeve: a blonde bimbo with a squeaky voice as head of the launching, perhaps? Jesus, this Bob Marley cut-out makes Kilmer from 'Red Planet' almost look like an astronaut; 2) Zemeckis, having graduated from Spielberg's School of Phony Sentimentality, offers us a good, idiotic example of what he has learned: in the very beginning of the picture, Foster asks her Daddy 'can we reach mother?', and - of course - millions of viewer weep instantaneously; this pathetic sentence certainly sets the stage for some other, similar soppy garbage to come; 3) Zemeckis, having also finished Ron Howard's School Of Bad Miscasting, presents us with McConaughey, who quite fittingly portrays a writer; we all know that writers look and talk like semi-literate surfer-dudes from the West Coast, so there is nothing really one can say about this wise casting choice; the fact that he looks as though he just spent half-a-year living in the African jungle and feeding off berries is only the more reason to accept him as a writer - and a reverend! 4) my favourite phrase from the movie is 'for the history of history'; Foster says it in one of her countless impassioned I'm-so-inspired-and-motivated-I-could-explode-and-cry speeches; Foster is on the verge of tears (of frustration, but also awe) so often that she needed to be injected with a sedative, but those scenes were wisely cut out; I have a late suggestion as to how the phrase could've been improved: how about 'for the history of history of history'? Now, that's what I call a phrase worthy of a successor to '2001: A Space Odyssey'! 5) McConaughey not only fits his role perfectly, but his exasperatingly pathetic cookie-fortune philosophizing is a marvel of bad modern script-writing; what's worse, he salivates his drivel on 'Larry King Live' which has the opposite of the intended effect: Zemeckis, in his infinite cluelessness, actually believes that McConaughey's words will be given extra weight by being said on King's empty-headed CNN show; however, all that Zemeckis achieves is to cheapen those speeches even more; I mean, come on: every other 80s and 90s movie has King doing a short pseudo-reality-feel bit - it's just so stale and unoriginal; 6) how about that hilarious, almost pythonesque scene where armed U.S. soldiers storm into Foster's observatory! 7) and when Woods storms alongside them, Foster shows just how oh-so rebellious she is - such baloney; as if she can afford to aggravate very high gov't people... a classic 'yeah, right' moment; 8) Zemeckis, having also finished Gus Van Sant's School Of Impeccable Lack Of Realism, serves us with actual Clinton footage, thinking very naively that his 'presence' in the movie will make it all that much more realistic; but - yet again - the opposite effect is achieved: it just looks phony and quite hokey, too; Zemi-baby, next time get an actor to play a President - that's what auditions for movies are for; 9) the gov't is so predictably paranoid and unreasonable... yawn... won't Zemi ever stop with the original plot-devices? 10) And the movie's Best Analogy goes to... McConaughey!... This Southern-drawl writer-reverend asks Foster to prove that she loves her father; Foster tells him - previously - that he can't prove God's existence, so McConaughey counters with a wildly ingenious argument that Foster can't prove the love for her father - hence, her argument is squashed; however, the only thing that is squashed is Sagan's brain (or whoever was responsible for this uniquely insipid dialog); the problem with this idiotic argument is simple: you can't confuse the proving of an actual being, person, object, or even entity, with the proving of a concept or opinion - that is just too stupid for words, but I'm sure the fanatically religious out there loved that analogy in all its moronic 'glory'; 11) how about that pathetic and soppy scene where the kids of an astronaut beg their daddy - on live TV - not to go on the mission! (That scene belongs in 'Armageddon'. Then again - no. It belongs right here.) 12) How about Skerritt getting chosen to fly?!!! Even a dumb Hollywood writer ought to know that an old geezer like that would never be chosen to go, what with all the healthy, young, strong, capable astronauts lying around doing nothing; 13) what's with that character that Hurt plays? A cross between some kind of space-swami and James Bond super-rich bad guy; 14) Fichtner is plain awful and strikingly miscast as the blind guy; but Fichtner isn't really at fault: that character is dumb; the character's only purpose is to increase the Spielberg Factor Of Mushy Sentimentality to unbearable levels.But I've saved the best for last: 15) easily the most idiotic scene, plot-twist, line of dialogue, or character in the movie is when that hilarious-looking blond actor from 'Back to the Future' sabotages the first mission!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How I laughed, and how I very much laughed and laughed... First of all, how the hell did he get there??? NASA isn't some theme-park where people just sneak in anywhere they please - especially at times of crucial launchings! Secondly, what's with that mugging? Does he have to act like he is playing Elmer Fudd? Hasn't Zemi-baby forgot to inform him that they were not shooting 'Back to the Future 4'? Sorry, but I've hit the 1000-word review limit.

Donnie Darko," Did Donnie the pyromaniac set fire to the script's ending?
","When I heard about the large bunny before seeing this large lump of confusion, I was instantly stricken with fear - fear of getting as bored as with the damn unfunny rabbit in 'Harvey', one of the worst comedies of all time. Ironically, the rabbit in DD was the best aspect of the movie; the appearance and the voice were effective. However, the story is a bit of a mess; many loose ends, too many irrelevant characters, and an ending that is a major f**k-up. The 'grand finale' is a rushed job, so lacking in logic that there is nothing to redeem it. The way Malone gets killed was absurd: her and the gay cowboy getting jumped by the school-bullies was incredibly dumb, and even worse was the way that whole segment was directed: did Kelly run out of money? I doubt it; his inexperience as a 25 year-old writer and director showed. As for the time travel, all we're shown is something vaguely resembling a worm-hole, an absurd scene in which DD's mother and sister are in a plane that is about to crash - and suddenly we're back to day one: DD is dead, killed by that soft jet engine (soft, because it failed to crush the entire house as it should have), and DD sacrificed himself for his love, Malone. Get your handkerchiefs out!Kelly is the son of a NASA scientist who worked on the 70s Mars mission. That pretty much explains how he managed to get his foot in the door and be a writer/director of a major production at 25. However, it contradicts his lack of understanding of science. Apart from the jet engine failing to completely annihilate the Darko house and everyone in it (due to modern airplanes being made out of sponge, apparently), Kelly also has trouble with the concept of time-travel. Actually, he should have asked his Dad to explain to him a few things about it. Time-travel is VERY tricky in any story, especially when you touch on it with such a lack of seriousness as Kelly does.Kelly's DD is one big indulgence piece. He plays his favourite childhood songs in their entirety (which in the case of the first Tears for Fears song was quite pleasant, actually), he introduces unnecessary characters just for the hell of it, and he proudly exhibits his left-wing leanings by siding with Dukakis. Kelly was smart enough, though, to know that a script gets sold in Hollywood FAR more easily when it has any kind of pro-liberal Reagan-bashing in it. So predictable...Any of you aspiring Hollywood writers, remember this: throw in as many politically correct/anti-Republican messages in your stories, and the odds of you selling your script quadruple, at the very least.The cast is weak. I have rarely seen a movie with this much nepotism in it. Both Gyllenhaal kids are nepotistic brood; but while Maggie is charming (though almost non-present with only several scenes), her brother Jack is an amateur. This gay cowboy's grimacing was occasionally embarrassing to watch, and he simply isn't the caliber of actor/gay cowboy to carry a movie. Jena Malone is cute and quite solid. Swayze, another nepotistic actor, is unconvincing; both the accent and the line-delivery are quite awful. Drew Barrymore? What can I say about Drew?? Awful as ever! However, while I can bear to see her playing airheads, trying to watch her as an English teacher(!) was a chore. It would be like watching Susan Sarandon playing a U.S. President in a drama, complete with her Southern twang, the one she uses so often. Drew's brain is fried with drugs and alcohol she massively stuffed herself with in her PRE-teens, and it really is obvious. She looks as if she hasn't read a book in her life, so the casting is idiotic. But why be surprised: she is one of the executive producers here, so who could stop her from materializing her wish to finally play someone with a three-digit I.Q., that way stroking her own inferiority-complexed ego.Nevertheless, not all is bad in the DD universe. The movie is close to 2 hours long, yet kept my attention throughout. The drawback about the plot being senselessly convoluted also meant that it wouldn't be as dull. Not exactly riveting and, sure, not much of a story, but few movies are watchable nowadays, which is why the rating here isn't (too) low.If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, with over 400 photos/explanations entries, contact me by e-mail.

The Birds," Birds attack humans and Hitchcock doesn't care much to explain why.
","So this is the super-duper masterpiece 'classic'... First thing I noticed: Hedren is ugly - unbearably ugly. Then there is an eternity until the birds appear. 'Cute' comedy/melodrama shticks of the first half (in which the birds are noticeably absent) interest no one. Pointless dialogues which get us to know the irrelevant characters better. Why? There is a stupid exchange with the cop when he interrupts Taylor with 'how old is she (Taylor's sister)?'. Why is the sheriff skeptical? Were the birds attacking Taylor & co of all people? Why didn't the sparrows attack when they got in through the chimney; because they're smaller they're less violent?! Come on... Why did Hedren decide to get the children out of the school when the birds gathered outside? Shouldn't it be the most basic of all reasoning to stay inside where it's safer?! There was no previous indication that Hedren's character has an I.Q. lower than 4 - which would be the only sort of intelligence which would explain that daft decision. And why did she react so slowly to the gradual gathering of the birds in the school park?? After all, she'd been attacked two times before that! The gov't is unsure whether to send an army?! Not only that: nothing and no one gets sent to the town in spite of knowledge of bird attacks!! This movie hasn't been thought through at all; the illogic is everywhere. If some unknown director had done this crap, it would never have received nearly as many good reviews as it otherwise did. But just because it's Hitchcock, it doesn't get justly regarded as a dumb horror film about birds. I liked the parrots acting peculiarly in the car, but that's about it.If you want a truly silly analysis about the 'deeper' meanings behind this turd of a film, check out Slavoj Zizek's rants in his documentary 'A Pervert's Guide To Cinema'.",Null,38,78,3 January 2007
The Simpsons Movie," 'Simpsons: The (Shamelessly Left-Wing Propaganda) Movie'.
","The Greenday, sorry... the Green House Effect; the U.S. gov't is evil; Democrats to power!; Capitalism is evil; corporations and CEOs are all Fascists; All Hail Che Guevara and Joseph Stalin!... So what else is new in the extreme Left-wing Simpsons universe? Absolutely nothing. Except maybe that politics never played such a large role as in their redundant theatrical release. That fat charlatanic clown Michael Moore must be proud.(Btw, they ARE right (sorry... left) about one thing: only morons would pay to see what you get for free on TV. I watched this for free so I'm in the clear.)Let's start with direct quotes 'This gov't has lost its credibility so now it's borrowing some of mine'. - Tom Hanks. Just what credibility has Hanks the do-goodering hypocrite have? Credibility as a dumb Hollywood actor? Two Oscars for playing dullards in very bad movies? Or maybe they refer to his credibility of agreeing to star in a thriller based on a book which made up a plethora of fallacious historical claims? ('The Da Vinci Code', of course.) 'Finally the white rich man is in control again'. - Mr. Burns. This sounds like Michael Moore's 'Dumb White Men' book title. What's this superiority complex that these Marxist American white men have? They are apparently the 'noble' white men - a minority, but of course - while all these multitudes of right-winging and centrist white people (yes, even centrists are labeled as 'Fascists' by these clueless arrogant buffoons) are all supposed to be money-hungry racists who destroy the environment. Matt Groening and his merry band of rich middle-aged douche-bag hippies seem to forget that it's the Communist nations and other countries with dictatorships that pollute the environment by far the most. So who should be in control then, according to these Maoists? Should the U.S. have a Congress made up of 500 blacks and American Indians and 3 white women? Is that the point here? Laughable... 'The evil white man'. I don't even know how to call this?... 'Auto-racism'? 'Self-racism'? It's so absurd it's almost funny.'America: where any man can make quick money with no questions asked'. - Homer. This is actually a good point. For example: any Hollywood producer can put together a Left-wing propaganda movie, using millions of 'dollarinos', make false claims and spread slander about various gov't institutions and other issues - all in the name of 'satire', but of course - and then release that trash onto millions of gullible, semi-educated viewers AND MAKE TONS OF MONEY. What hypocrites these left-wing, RICH, morons are. Mighty rich, coming from these stinking rich, decadent, drug-happy Hollywood writers! It's precisely America's freedom that allows Hollywood to spread its Leftist anti-U.S. propaganda in the first place... Should be a hit in France...'I am the mascot of an evil corporation'. - Bart. Yet ANOTHER stab at corporations, one of about a dozen in this 'Battleship Potemkin' sequel... Matt Groening, a rather fat man, is a consumer, just like the rest of us, yet he hates all these corporations... Does he even know why? Probably not. Too much pot over the decades has softened his head somewhat.'It's not like the U.S. gov't is listening to everyone's conversation'. An obvious nod to Bush's new anti-terrorism laws, which the Leftists so oppose, simply because to them terrorists barely even exist - and isn't it Bush anyway who, according to them, caused 9/11? Jesus... This movie is so full of such blatant anti-Bush/Republican propaganda, I wonder why they dimply didn't release this overly long political cartoon in October 2008, just before the U.S. elections? 'The gov't actually found someone we're looking for'. A nod to the current gov't's inability to find Bin Laden. Of course, as we ALL know, if Gore or Hillary were in power, Bin Laden would be found in a millisecond! This entire movie is so riddled with desperate liberal pleas for the masses to stop voting Republican, that it takes away so much from enjoying the actually quite solid humour. It is so full of Left-wing dogma that I almost wonder if Bin Laden and Sean Penn financed it... I'll have to check the end-credits again...Already the beginning of this 'movie' put me off. Green Day, of all bands, desecrating the main 'Simpsons' melody?? Green Day are - ironically - a typical ultra-commercial product of EVIL MUSIC CORPORATIONS (this time I agree about the evil part...), consisting of three spoiled upper-class preppies, one of whom is even called Joseph Hickles Erland the Third (or st. like that), who pretend to play punk while they belt out their sorry pop tunes that even Burns's great-grandfather could move his feet to without missing a beat. Rich pseudo-punk rebel midgets who want to save the world like that egomaniac Bono? Gimme a break...Matt Groening, Green Day, and Michael Moore are the 'American Idiots' and 'Dumb White Men' here. The irony here should make mountains shake - to the tune of a heavy, hard-rockin' Green Day... ballad. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black...Watching that semi-amusing segment in Homer's brain reminded of the typical mind of a self-deluded, denial-ridden, overly idealistic, smug Hollywood liberal: that kind of nonsense pretty much goes on in their heads, too. Should I even say it...? Yes: another painful irony.This cute 80-minute political cartoon has a much stronger first half. Once the setting changes to Alaska, it's all downhill. Still, the level of the comedy in 'Simpsons: the (Marxist View of Modern America) Movie' is far better than that of the last 10 or so seasons. After all, 17 years is far too long. That show is spent. If you want something funny AND intelligent, totally unpretentious (i.e. no annoying Lisa characters) watch 'South Park'. Unlike the 'Simpsons' show, they're in their prime still...",Null,3,11,12 October 2007
All the President's Men," Yet another biased, left-wing propaganda film based on 'true events'.
","Before you read this text, a reminder to left-wingers: if today is May 1st, you shouldn't be wasting your time on the web. You should be marching the streets, screaming against Capitalism and America, throwing your little red book at unsuspecting bystanders. Otherwise, you may read on...Just one in a long line of propagandist anti-Republican movies released during election years with naive hope of swaying the U.S. voters to vote Left. 'The Candidate', however, failed to prevent Nixon from losing in 1972. Just as 'Fahrenheit 9/11', released in election year 2004, didn't prevent Bush from winning. A left-wing Hollywood 'See? See?! That's what you get when you elect a Republican!' propaganda film. A pointless film; everyone knows what happened, and what isn't quite clear will by no means be clarified by a superficial, utterly biased Tinseltown film. Robert Redford again does an impression of a stone-faced man, and gives his best in trying to make himself look intellectual (I often get the feeling that Redford spends most of his time in front of a mirror trying to achieve this) but he is no intellectual; he is a talentless left-wing blonde Hollywood bimbo. The only thing that separates him from other bimbos like Drew Barrymore or Melanie Griffith - apart from the penis - is that he doesn't talk slowly, like a retard. Hoffman is wasted here. I wonder if they'd have made this film if Nixon had been a Democrat... Oh - but I forgot; a Democrat would NEVER do anything immoral or illegal; Democrat presidents are too busy helping the homeless and the poor.Avoid this garbage, unless you love left-wing nonsense.

V for Vendetta," Did you know that terrorists were the good guys?
","If you're a Che-Guevara-T-shirt-wearing moron, you'll love this.Living in the AGE OF THE IDIOT, i.e. the AGE OF Paris HILTON, if you like, nothing surprises me anymore. It doesn't surprise me even that a comic-book (sorry, GRAPHIC NOVEL) is used to propagate deranged messages about the modern terrorist threat and the supposed 'paranoia' that surrounds it. Not a novel, not a brilliant intellectual original screenplay  but a comic-book. It's yet more retarded stuff for the brainwashed MTV generation. Hello, 21st century! Bin Laden couldn't have wished for a better propaganda film than this. He must be sitting somewhere in one of his caves in Pakistan/Aghanistan, thinking what fools those Hollywood morons are. Why should he and his wonderful freedom-fighters (according to this movie  this is implied) even spend money and time on internet propaganda when Tinseltown is doing his dirty work for him.The very idea that terrorists are noble freedom-fighters is not an old one: we know it from Marxist radicals. Nothing new there. It's also nothing new that Hollywood has been in the hands of Leftists since the first film studios were established there. Nothing new are also the dozens of left-wing propaganda dramas and thrillers that Hollywood spits out every year, tirelessly trying to convert ALL of us to THEIR idiotic, extremist way of thinking, and their dubious 'moral values'. (Hollywood, the world's center of decadence - drugs and orgies being as common as the common cold  wanting to preach 'values'; this is truly hilarious.) However, even Hollywood's cretins have 'topped' themselves this time. This movie's message is so immoral, so cretinous, based on so many falsehoods and lies  ironical, since the movie accuses 'the other side' (you know, Bush, Blair and other 'evil rulers') of those same things.The makers of this film are Joel Silver  a maker of retarded action movies, check out his filmography to see juts how intellectual his movies are, and the Wachowsky Brothers  known for their incredibly muddled and dumb 'Matrix' trilogy (fine, the first movie was admittedly good). These guys were such cowards that they didn't even have the guts to set the story in New York, L.A. or somewhere else in the States. They knew that would have killed their movie. Play it safe and set it in London, hoping that most Americans will be too dumb to directly identify the anti-US stance so over-abundant in this crap-fest.Style over substance, just like 'Matrix'. But I've rarely seen SUCH a discrepancy between style and substance in a movie! Terrific photography and... (well, that's about it). Weaving lends a good voice to 'V'. Natalie Portman's accent? Pretty bad. Acting? Bad, as always. Why do English actresses keep getting cast as Americans and vice versa, I'll never understand. (Are they all trying to be future Meryl Streeps, doing silly, bad accents in hopes of getting 35 Oscars? Sad.) And check out that pathetic, over-idealistic, and VERY predictable ending: masses of masked Londoners taking a stand against the 'evil' police. I could have laughed, but by then I just wanted this crap to end so I could finally rest my brain from this movie's terrorist assault on my senses.Normally I'd give even a left-wing movie a solid rating if it's done skillfully. But a movie that sides with terrorism and defends demented radicals and psychopathic terrorists as misunderstood idealists, such as 'V for V' is, leaves such a foul taste in my mouth that there is nothing left but to consider this one as one of the worst big-budget movies ever made, if nothing than because of its vile message masked as a 'democratic' one. Since when were Leftists ever interested in democracy? It's like MTV's 'Vote Or Die' campaign of 2004, which meant: 'Vote for Democrats! We don't want you to vote who YOU prefer, but who WE want you to vote for! Vote for Kerry or DIE! WE decide who you should vote for and how you ought to think!' Leftist arrogance and hypocrisy have never ceased to amaze me.",Null,36,72,27 January 2007
