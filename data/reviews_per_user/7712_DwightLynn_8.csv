Ford v Ferrari," Predictable but Endearing
","I am not a car person. I don't like the smell of them, I don't particularly like driving around in them, and I couldn't care less about petty differences between car companies. That being said, Ford v. Ferrari managed to win me over.It took a subject matter I had no interest in and got me invested with endearing characters brought to life by great performances from Bale and Damon. This is a perfect movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon; it's predictable every step of the way, but it leaves you satisfied and even a little sad to say goodbye to these characters you've grown to love.The only other James Mangold directed films I've seen were his two Wolverine films, and while Ford v. Ferrari is no where close to the quality of something like Logan, it does have that same emotionally honest quality that Mangold's other films have. FvF is fun, it's got a good pace to it, and it put a smile on my face. Sometimes the most predictable story is also the most satisfying.",7,1,2,14 January 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Introspective and Life-Changing
","Blade Runner 2049 is one of those rare treasures of a movie where every element of filmmaking comes together to make an unforgettable and mesmerizing experience. With visuals that are pure pleasure for the eye, and existential themes about individuality that near anyone can relate to, the power this film has is not to be underestimated. Although the slow pace may not be for everyone's taste, if one lets themselves become absorbed in the world of Blade Runner, they will find something to relate to. This is a film that is able to communicate, in a well-paced and well-acted story, just what it means to be human.The original Blade Runner never needed a sequel. Its story ended so succinctly and on such a powerful note that a continuation should logically detract from it. But somehow, by some miracle, there not only exists a sequel to the original Blade Runner, but it actually manages to transcend the original's themes, characters, and visuals.If any other director attempted to make a sequel, even Ridley Scott himself, I am convinced it would have been a complete disaster. However, this isn't just any filmmaker at the helm of this film. Behind the director's chair is Denis Villeneuve, the man who has made masterpiece after masterpiece with his career so far. He's mastered drama and tension with Prisoners (2013), he's tackled psychological thrillers with Enemy (2013), and he's already proven himself to be fluent in Sci-Fi with his previous mind-blowing film, Arrival (2016).In Blade Runner 2049, all the elements that made his previous films work so well are here in full. The film centers around a Blade Runner named Officer K, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling, who is in charge of putting down rogue androids which the predominant humans see as a threat.Right from the general premise the film carves out its own identity with its heartbreaking irony of having the lead android assasin be an android himself. Although the main character is quiet and reserved, we get to see a lot of how he thinks and feels through his actions. When killing an android in the opening scene, he shows no visible excitement or passion. This continues for the next couple scenes as we get to see his general routine, how he's treated, and we see how he lacks initiative. He has had his soul effectively ripped out of him through the tedium and psychological torture involved with his job. K constantly being abused is what makes his proactive turn to self-discovery that occurs later on so satisfying to witness. The original film was awe-inspiring with its dissection of what it means to be human, but this film appeals to me in a whole other way. In this film, K questions not only what he is, but he also chases a more personal question: who am I?Slow pacing permeates throughout the whole film, which allows for more time to be spent with its characters and its world. Some people may be turned off by how long certain scenes last, but I'd argue this is what makes the emotional moments hit even harder and it makes the breathtaking imagery stick with the audience even longer. When a film moves slowly, a sudden emotional jolt or revelation can feel all the more drastic and effective. Films these days seem to be afraid to stop and let audience's take something in. Even films I really enjoy are usually quick and lack any slow-pacing out of fear of boring the audience. What I appreciated about this film, and really all of Denis Villeneuve's films, is that they put faith in the audience. Villeneuve puts faith in the audience by not outright stating what the point of the movie was. Rather, the audience is left, much like the character K, to seek out meaning themselves.For me, this film helped me realize how important life is. How, even though I'm not the most important person in the world, I can still make a difference in people's lives. It is one thing for a film to entertain or be well-made on a technical level, but it is another thing entirely for a film to change how I view life. That is something only works of art can accomplish, and Blade Runner 2049 certainly qualifies.",10,4,12,30 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just a really strange movie
","I'm a big fan of the original Star Wars trilogy. I think all three hold up pretty well and while I think prequels are unnecessary, they could potentially be done interestingly and provide greater context for the movies to follow.Unfortunately, The Phantom Menace is not a good prequel nor is it a good movie. I have trouble even considering this a movie. Movies usually have plots and they have characters that change as the story progresses. The Phantom Menace has a plot, theoretically, but it is so incoherent and hard to follow this movie might as well not have had one.If someone asked me to explain what happens in this movie I think my head would explode. I can describe moments. But the actual plot? I still don't know. It's strange because the original Star Wars trilogy is such a simple story. All three films are easy to follow, they have a main character, and the rest of the characters have these things called 'personalities' which the 'characters' in this movie lack.There are really no characters in this film. There are actors exchanging dialogue on screen, but character implies personality, which every one of these planks of wood lack. The only real characters are young Anakin Skywalker and this Jar Jar creature. However, the dialogue is so awful and everything they say is so on the nose. There's this idea that Star Wars is for children. And while I always disagreed with that idea because of the maturity of the original trilogy, this movie is something I feel only children would like. And even then, they would be bored by the large amount of politics in this film.Politics can be interesting in a sci-fi story. Star Trek deals with politics often and it usually does it well. However, because George Lucas at this point as loss touch with all of humanity and what makes us like to watch movies, the politics in this film are incredibly hard to follow and dull.Overall, this is just a really odd movie. Nothing works. Nothing is done well or even exceptionally well. No scene has suspense because it is so hard to relate to our strange, emotion-less main characters. The protagonists are impossible to relate to. The main villain never speaks and doesn't have a personality. I legitimately cannot understand how any human being could like this movie. I think the only reason this movie is still brought up at all is because it has 'Star Wars' in its name. But this film is far from the quality of the originals. Just a really dull film.",1,1,4,8 January 2020
Hot Fuzz," A Film with Personality
","With Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright has managed to make a perfect movie. The screenplay, acting, directing and editing all work in tandem to deliver a sweet, satisfying experience that leaves one feeling exhilarated. What makes this film so good is the consistency; the beginning of the movie establishes this break-neck pace that follows the film through every scene. Even quiet scenes still have lots of energy to them, and it really gives the film a personality.The movie is essentially a parody of over-the-top action movies, and it captures all that make these films appealing, while ditching all the baggage these films carry. This film has a tongue-in-cheek quality to it, but it never treats its characters as lesser-than. The characters all take their world seriously, which makes the ridiculous plot even funnier and makes it easier for audiences to stay connected to what they're watching.Too many parodies make the mistake of being immature nonsense, making it difficult for the audience to connect at all emotionally to the film. Hot Fuzz however manages to ride the line between dumb and sincere, and so you're left not only laughing constantly at the witty dialogue and editing, but you also feel connected to the characters; a testament to the wonderful screenplay by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.Like other fantastic movies, every scene matters and leads to the next scene. Even the dialogue is critically important; on a second watch it becomes apparent just how much reincorporation of certain elements there are. What might sound like a silly throwaway line ends up coming back later to impact the plot. The characters are also hugely memorable. There are characters who show up for 2 minutes and yet they somehow manage to make a huge impression. This is not only due to the actors being naturally good at what they're doing, but it is also proof of the stellar direction. Edgar Wright knows exactly what he is doing every frame of this film. The entire thing feels so perfectly orchestrated that by the end you can't help but smile at how everything came together.This really is a wonderful experience and it leaves you awestruck at the power film can have. The editing is so hard to describe but it adds so much to the experience and makes Edgar Wright stand out as a director. It's no wonder he has become a household name among film-fans!",10,0,1,23 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Embarassing
","After the Phantom Menace came out in 1999, George Lucas got some backlash so he decided to retaliate against humanity with Attack of the Clones. A truly horrid picture, Attack of the Clones has virtually nothing going for it outside of the amazing John Williams score, which is truly spectacular.The main problem with the Phantom Menace is that the whole thing felt aimless; it was so hard to grasp any character or any story, so by the time it ends the viewer can't help but feel a wave of emptiness pass over them. In Attack of the Clones, the plot is a bit more coherent. It is still all over the place, but by the end of the film I think if I tried really hard I could maybe describe what happens.Wisely, George Lucas decided to focus more on character this time around, which is a smart decision, but unfortunately George Lucas' dialogue is so inhuman and robotic that it is impossible to take anything seriously. This movie really does feel like it was written by a high schooler, which is odd because George Lucas' scripts back in the '70's were very well-structured.The cinematography is just as robotic. Like Phantom Menace, the entire film is shot as plainly as possible. Gone are the gorgeous zooms and close-ups of Empire Strikes Back, and gone is the impressive set design of the original Star Wars. This film is bloated with so much CGI that has aged horribly. It is impossible to be invested because the entire thing looks like a Playstation 1 cutscene. At least the Phantom Menace had mostly practical sets. The actors actually looked like they were in a movie and not a videogame. Here, the only enjoyment I get out of the film is laughing at how bad everything looks.This movie has interesting ideas. Anakin falling to the darkside could be dramatically exciting, and I like the idea of Count Dooku being a fallen Jedi who has lost faith in the Jedi council. That is an interesting way to parallel and foreshadow Anakin's eventual fall, but the film does not dwell on what could have been an interesting relationship. Instead, most of the film is filled with dull CGI fight sequences, or romance scenes which feel like something out of Tommy Wiseau's The Room.Obi-Wan being a detective also could have been an interesting development, but again, the lousy presentation of the film makes it hard to take seriously. Ewan McGregor is great but he does not have much to interact with besides creepy CGI monsters and creepy children. I like the idea of the Jedi getting an army unexpectedly, and it could've been interesting to see how this weird group of space monks deal with being thrust into a war, but the movie doesn't focus on that. Yoda just shows up with the clones and everything is fine. How do the Jedi feel about this situation? I have no idea.Much like the entire prequel trilogy, there are interesting ideas present, and the bones of a good story are there, but it is coated in so much CGI nonsense that I don't know how anyone can enjoy this. I understand wanting to love everything because it's Star Wars, but sometimes you have to draw the line somewhere. This was an embarrassment.",1,1,2,14 January 2020
1917," A Unique Experience with a few Flaws
","1917 has some of the best cinematography seen on film, bar none. This film is directed by Skyfall-director, Sam Mendes, but the real star is Roger Deakins, the man behind the camera. The entire presentation of the film is so unique and so hypnotizing to watch. This movie takes the Birdman approach and tries to make the entire film look like it was filmed all in one take. The fact that they took this approach with a war film of all things is commendable, and it paid off quite spectacularly. So many moments in the film left me speechless and left me marveled at the filmmaking.The acting, soundtrack and mood of the film were also excellent. Even though this is a war movie, there are lots of quiet moments in the film, and the stellar set design and soundtrack take center stage. These moments add lots of tension and atmosphere, which better lets the viewer put themselves in the world.My only complaint with the film is that the characters feel somewhat underdeveloped. They are very likeable, and I enjoyed seeing their journey and following them, but they do not feel very three-dimensional. This was fine for me because a movie like 1917 is more about the experience of feeling like you're in a war, and it accomplished that, but a little more character moments could have helped.Overall, this was a very excellent and unique experience that I feel will be remembered for years to come as a true technical marvel. It is definitely worth a watch.",8,4,8,11 January 2020
Midsommar," A Powerful and Bizarre Ride
","After the powerhouse that was Hereditary, I was eager to see how writer-director, Ari Aster, would follow up his amazing debut. Midsommar is an ambitious second film that carries over some of what worked with his initial film while having a different feel overall.Like Hereditary, this film is carried by a wonderful lead actress who goes through an entire cavalcade of emotion. Florence Pugh was an actress I was unaware of, but following this film I am definitely going to keep my eye out for her. She was jaw-dropping. She conveyed grief and sadness so vigorously it almost became hard to watch.One thing that was interesting about this film is that unlike Hereditary, which was unpredictable the entire way through, in this film the outcome is fairly apparent. It is a horror movie about a bunch of people visiting a strange place; you kinda know what is going to happen to them. But what kept my interest, aside from the great presentation, is how Aster presents his characters.They are believable. Especially the boyfriend character. They aren't over-the-top; they are real people. And that makes what happens to them all the more heartbreaking. Aster really likes to put his characters through the ringer emotionally. There are moments in this film where his characters are so emotionally-devastated part of you just wants to reach into the screen and put your hand on their shoulder.The presentation of the film is notable as well. What stuck out to me is the amazing cinematography, score, and lighting. Having a horror movie set during the day is a unique decision and it benefited the film greatly. There are so many breathtaking shots in this film that it almost becomes more mesmerizing than scary. Midsommar lures you in slowly and looks innocent at first, much like the cult of this film.If I had any complaints it would be about the last 20 minutes or so. As mentioned previously, the plot is somewhat predictable, and that is fine for a movie like this because if anything, this just increases the dread the audience feels for the characters. The problem I had with the last little chunk of the film is that the two remaining characters left were both rendered mute. This was a good way to get the audience to focus on the creepy visuals, but with completely silent protagonists it becomes kind of hard to relate to what is happening on screen.The characters are written so well that when they no longer speak I feel left in the dark. And since the plot is kind of predictable, the ending feels a little too slow for me. I think Aster could have achieved the same feeling in the end if the pacing was a bit quicker. This is another complaint I have: the movie may be a little too long for its own good. Hereditary had such a breakneck pace that this may be jarring to some.Still, what makes this film compelling is its characters and the journey they go on. Aster is a king at mixing relationship drama with disturbing ideas and images. His films really stick with you more than most horror films because of this, and I am very eager to see what messed up thing he cooks up next.Midsommar is a unique experience and very much worth watching. Although it is a bit uneven in some places, like pacing and the occasional cheesy moment, it is so crazy and strange that it can become impossible to look away.",7,6,9,14 January 2020
Joker," Good but nothing special
","Joker is a movie that many have been talking about this year, and I'm not sure if all that talk is justified. Joker is a fine movie: it has a good lead performance, a good score, good cinematography, some quiet moments of subtlety, and it comments on topical issues that give the film some relevance. But beyond that, there isn't much to say about the film. Narratively, it's fairly shallow and simplistic. The overall message of the movie is so simple that this film does not really owe itself to rewatch value, nor do I think it would hold up after one watch.This film has been called a rorschach test by its lead star, Joaquin Phoenix, and I would certainly agree with him, but not in a positive way. I do agree that think it is up to the viewer to interpret something deeper out of the story, but that is not because the story is smart, but rather because of how simple it is. Arthur Fleck is a mentally-ill person who gets stepped on by everyone around him. Eventually, he takes control of his life, murders some people, and becomes the Joker.There is nothing wrong with having a simple story, but when every character besides the main character is cartoonishly one dimensional, and when the dialogue is this on the nose, it makes it harder to take this message seriously. The only really memorable character in the film is Arthur himself. Everyone else, from his neighbor across the hall, to his psychiatrist, to Murray, to Arthur's work friend seem to only exist to be thorns in Arthur's side. The movie is strangely repetitive as we are introduced to these four figures in Arthur's life in one scene only to have them betray him in one way or another in the next. This is what I mean when I say the film is simplistic.Every character and plot beat in the film is against Arthur. The film does not have any smarter way of generating sympathy for Arthur other than making him a punching bag. I think the reason some praise this film while others hate it is because of their ability or inability respectively to relate to the main character. If one relates to Arthur being an outcast, then they can probably find a lot of themselves inside the hyper-exaggerated craziness of the main character. If one does not relate to Arthur, or if one finds his passiveness to be uncompelling, then the film becomes rather dull.As for me, I was mesmerized by Joaquin Phoenix's performance and I was most happy when the movie let the visuals speak for themselves. As I said before, I found the dialogue in this film rather on the nose, so when the film presents no-dialogue sequences of Arthur dancing, or doing weird stuff like climbing into the fridge, I enjoyed the film. I wish the script had more faith to leave things up to the audience. Instead of just making Arthur the ultimate victim, I think the story would have been more interesting if there were some things that were Arthur's fault and some things that weren't. The closest thing I can think of is Arthur getting fired because he had his gun on him, but the film presents it in a way where Arthur's coworker is really responsible for him having the weapon.The film is clearly heavily inspired by Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, and sadly it is not as thought provoking as either of them. I normally hate the 'this movie isn't very good because this other movie did it better' argument, as that can be the case for virtually every film. But for this movie, I think comparing it to Martin Scorsese films is justified because not only does the film itself make numerous references to these two movies, but the director ToddPhillips constantly mentions those films being direct influences. Certain scenes, like Arthur idealizing Murray, having a supportive girlfriend who may or may not actually care, and being rejected by countless individuals is straight out of King of Comedy; and Arthur feeling like an outsider to society is clearly reminiscent of Taxi Driver. While Taxi Driver focused on the mentally-ill, prostitutes,There's nothing wrong with being inspired by other films, but the problem with Joker is that most of its substance is entirely derived from those films. When entire subplots just feel like updated versions of films from the '70's and '80's, I can't help but feel a little unengaged. This movie does add some interesting elements to the usual 'man goes mad' formula, but it does not go in any new directions.I thought the idea of framing Joker's rise as a class war between the rich and poor of the city was a very smart choice. It is very relevant and different from its influences. I just wish that more was explored with how Arthur felt about his followers. It's interesting because Arthur is someone who doesn't care about money; he specifically says he isn't political and yet all the people in clown masks are using his image to make a political statement. I wanted to see what Author felt about that, how he felt still being an outcast even among people that dress and worship him. But we don't really get into that. He just seems vaguely happy when he sees clown-folk, and it's upsetting because I think the movie could have further explored its isolation themes and shown how blind followers are probably not the best catharsis for being alone. It felt strange how Joker just embraced being among people who didn't understand him.Another subplot I enjoyed but could have used more of was Arthur's imaginary girlfriend. I wasn't sure what the point of this entire subplot was. Is it to show that Arthur's lonely? Because we kind of understand that from the very start of the film. Is it to show that he's crazy? Because we understand that as well. The film doesn't have a real conclusion for this either. Arthur learns he's been imagining things, goes to the real girls apartment, and then just goes about his day. I genuinely don't understand why the imaginary girlfriend was included. At first I thought it was so Arthur could have someone to talk to, but they don't talk about anything really complicated. I think it's just another way for the simplistic script to make Arthur abandoned by someone.There are other subplots that feel strangely undercooked as well. While Thomas Wayne I thought was well-integrated, everytime Bruce Wayne showed up it took me out of the film. Comic book stuff just does not dwell with this grounded drama. Whenever the film went out of its way to show yet another murder of the Wayne parents, it felt like a studio note. It's like if you were watching Taxi Driver and then all of a sudden Aquaman showed up. Something as over-the-top as Batman just does not belong in this universe, and it was extremely distracting.Even though this review has been largely negative so far, it is important to talk about what works for me. The score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is fantastic. The quiet scenes where the score gets to convey Arthur's inner conflict work wonderfully. She's won many awards for her score, and its certainly deserved.The cinematography was also quite spectacular. There are many memorable shots and camera movements and it contributed a lot to why I thought the movie was good at the very least. My favorite shots include Arthur on the train with his head against the window, and Arthur climbing into the refrigerator.The lead star is also impressive. This isn't Joaquin Phoenix's best performance, but it is still impressive and it helps carry the film. Joaquin adds so much to the movie, and as I've learned, some of the more subtle moments of the film were completely improvised. Scenes of him dancing in the bathroom or climbing into the refrigerator were all smart, visual moments of conveying the journey Arthur was going on. Like I said, if the film had more moments like these, that didn't cram the message down the viewer's throats and let the audience think for themselves, I think the film would have been a masterpiece.As it stands, Joker is good, but nothing more. It is a well-acted, well-shot film with a decent enough structure of a man taking control of his life. It doesn't fully explore its themes and it owes so much of its existence to Scorsese, that it is hard to say it stands on its own. The viewer has to take it upon themself to give this film value. For me, I enjoyed the ride and it was entertaining enough even if some things left me unsatisfied. It certainly stands apart among the comic book genre (even if it really isn't a comic book film at all), and if it helps introduce people to smarter films of a similar vein, then I suppose it's hard to be mad at that.",6,3,5,17 January 2020
