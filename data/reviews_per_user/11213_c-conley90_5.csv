The Expendables 2," Several factors cripple this nearly great sequel to the first.
","I would have liked this movie well enough and all if it was not for the casting of bad actor champ Chuck Norris. Yes ladies and gentlemen he's here to be praised like a god by all the other action stars, talk about an ego. The fact that Stallone has to kowtow to him in this movie and say 'he's the greatest' basically is laughable. The rest of the movie is an alright mix of action and plotting. Though I find the sudden disappearance of Jet Li to be another ouch for this movie, but it compared to Chuck Norris being treated like some deity is small potatoes. Plus, Mickey Rourke being gone is another negative and Dolph lacks much substance to his character this time out. It was rather great the first movie actual had some substance with the characters. But not this one. But yes pretty much a OK sequel that sunk itself big time with Chuck Norris jokes and his lame ass showing up to the Good, the bad and the ugly theme?!!!",5,0,0,16 December 2014
Armageddon," Look folks, I like it better than Deep Impact, Michael Bay is no devil or Antichrist
","It's the movie that spawned that Aerosmith song to be stuck in your head for the bulk of 1998. And it's a movie with a more divided group of opinions ever seen. And it's directed by the man people called the devil and the Antichrist. It's Armageddon the second of two asteroid death movies released in 1998 the other being the kind of really boring realistic one with Morgan Freeman as president being the only crap I remember about it. This one is much more memorable, I don't it's less depressing to watch and Armageddon has all these good quotes that I remember from it and Deep Impact doesn't. I mean I know the movie knows nothing about how science works and blah, blah, blah. People, don't always go to the movies for extreme realism you morons and that's what Armageddon does it tells a exciting story that you may find annoying or improbable but it's exciting. I like the characters, it's my cup of tea sorry, I don't expect much out of big blockbuster disaster movie, it isn't going to change the world you idiots. I just find it better than Deep Impact and certainly better than most of the negative opinions and I think they should lay off on Bay and stop this crap about him. It's old and tiresome the amount of crap and ridicule I hear about him, it really is.",8,0,3,25 November 2012
2012," Same old Emmerich baloney re-packaged as 2012.
","Yes, you've seen it all before people, the same disaster movies in countless other films. Better films, Earthquake, Volcano, Dante's Peak, The Poseidon Adventure, Armageddon, Emmerich's own The Day after Tomorrow. Yes, Emmerich rounds out his over 2 hr flick with stock characters from War of the worlds(Spielberg version), and other disaster movie clichés in a truly boring turkey of a movie. And when it gets to the original part, the whole oh let's put the rich people on an ark crap and let the poor normal people die in the disaster. Never have I seen more of a elitist,somewhat racist plot point ever. And you know, John Cusack and his little annoying boring family will live, there's no suspense for us. There's nothing, but a really elitist, clichéd pile of garbage disaster movie to sit through. Were Emmerich should have just forgone special effects and put in stock footage from better disaster movies. It would have saved money on special effects. And I thought oh, Emmerich couldn't get any worse after shamelessly using the issue of global warming as a front liner for his next disaster spectacular. But here he is after so many awful movies from him, this the just crap. You know, Godzilla was bad, and so was day after tomorrow and 10,000 B.C. well let's not even get into that, but this is much worse. This so worse than Transformers 2, I mean at least Michael Bay put something in the movie that wasn't the same old cliché, hell he almost killed both of the main characters in the movie off. At least his characters weren't total cardboard cutouts. And it had at least better special effects than this. Oh don't see this movie, please don't watch it on TV, when there's nothing left on. Run, run for your lives and when 2012 comes and goes, laugh at this movie for it's outdated title and stupidity. And please someone stop Emmerich from directing another movie.",1,2,9,19 September 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I see the problems but again critics take it way too far and blow it out of proportion.
","The infamous sequel to the Transformers live action series, infamous for suppose racism (two jive talking robots and a African American guy with bad teeth, do not make a racism movie) plus Tyrese Gibson wasn't doing any stupid steppin-fetch-it comedy act in the movie. He was equally as heroic as the white guys. So I don't see the racism aspect, maybe stereotypical but what movie isn't. Two, the PG-13 level humor, including robot balls humor, farting, hash brownies, tasing, dogs screwing and John Tuturro's ass. The humor is a legitimate point, though I think some of it does work, I agree some isn't good. Especially the Tuturro ass shot, left me cringing. But did it totally cripple the movie, no, the first had a urination gag in it, did it ruin that movie, no. And critics weren't complaining about it. The high amount of comedy relief characters is a little much, Turturro being far and away the best outing the horrible Leo Spitz and the twins. People complained about the length, boy didn't see them complain about that in Pirates 3 or 2012. People criticize the action scenes, I agree a little better editing but what movie doesn't suffer from some bad editing. I must have not noticed it, I saw really beautifully done CGI action scenes. I just think the movie isn't worth the vitriol. I was really just sitting there wondering how critically obtuse people can be. Some people sit there and say that the movie was built for the lowest common denominator and only the easily amused or entertained. I really love such stupid comments, like I can't go to a movie just for a really good action experience and that it has to always make me think. I remember the long rage filled reviews on this movie from Roger Ebert to lowly internet critic Spoony one aka Noah Antwiler (who really had no room to talk as he makes freaking rape jokes on twitter). One of the most infamous was Harry Knowles, one of the stupidest reviews in a long time, telling us to out right ban and boycott the movie based on it's as Harry states racist content. I was downright floored, it's just a movie Knowles calm down. The kind of reaction is just kind of stupid especially from a professional like Knowles. And the racism is largely exaggerated as is the purposed bad treatment of women in the movie. Just because you have Megan Fox in hot clothing and poses doesn't especially make it a portray of women as nothing more than objects of desire considering Fox more than stands her own in an action scene or against one of the human sized robots. And then there's Isabel Lucas as the seductive human decpticon which I know kind of laying it thick in the sexual area for a supposed PG-13 movie. But it ultimately furthered the plot along so what. And I won't argue the plot or the other problems like how Bay knew geography for crap but the movie is fictional so somethings can slide. Some people need to stop nitpicking and just enjoy the movie stop getting all worked up over a fantasy world in a movie. So anyway just see the movie if you want to, don't let others negative opinion sway you, see it for yourself and decide your own opinion. I personally recommend it but my opinion is not status quo. Update: And to add furthermore, people who say this is worst movie in the world have to be ashamed of themselves, they obviously have no real experience watching movies as this movie is far, far away from being the worst. This isn't birdemic people, nor is it a Boll flick or The Room.",7,7,10,11 October 2012
Final Destination," The Beginning of a Franchise
","Final Destination began out as rather thrilling Scream clone in the late 90s. It just seems like a Scream clone, all the actors are pretty boys and girls from the WB like Urban Legend, Cursed, Dracula 2000, all those Scream sequels. But there is a level of intelligence involve in this, instead of another masked killer, we have a force of nature. A thing that can't be seen that comes calling to take teens to the grave. Death. A force more powerful that a psychotic killer or even Dracula. That marks a difference from many other of it's Scream-like brethren. It's more original, and it spends more time talking philosophy with teens about Death and fate then the other entries in this franchise did. The series honestly became more of a slasher as it went along, which is OK, but certainly lost some of the great aspects of the first one. It's also ironic that this is the least gory one of the series, though still squirm worthy and horrific in it's deaths.",8,1,1,21 October 2014
