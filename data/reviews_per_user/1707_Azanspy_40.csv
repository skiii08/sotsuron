Ford v Ferrari," A very good race.
","Ford vs Ferrari is that old school Hollywood drama that Hollywood doesn't make anymore. This movie reminded me of some excellent films that I have watched long ago. Ford v Ferrari definitely is included in those excellent list of movies now. This movie gives us the chills and adrenaline pumps not only in the racing scenes but most of the other scenes. Matt Damon and Christian Bale were so good as the leading pair as expected. This project started as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the leading roles but I couldn't think of anyone other than Matt and Christian for these roles. The movie has drama, comedy, great chills we expect from a racing movie, father son relationship, friendship, wife husband etc. The chances of this movie winning the best picture at Oscar's is few but it's definitely one of the best films I have seen this year and one of the two best racing drama's I have ever seen. P. S. Rush is the other one.",9,2,4,28 January 2020
First Man," A well picturised space drama.
","First Man is not an ordinary space drama you expect. Damien Chazelle here gave importance to emotions. On the technical side, First Man have a decent cinematography and a very good scores as in every Damien Chazelle movie. Ryan Gosling did a good job but we have seen him do better. Claire Foy also did a good job in supporting role. Overall, First Man is not a very engaging sci-fi movie. It is a slow paced emotional drama. So it will be not everyone's cup of tea.",8,0,2,22 December 2018
Hereditary," A movie that leaves you thrilled.
","Hereditary leaves us thrilled and confused as most horror movies does. The unique direction has led this movie to a watchable one. Yeah, it's very scary at times too.",6,0,1,27 August 2018
Rocketman," One of the best biopics in recent times.
",Rocketman is that movie which should receive praise and acclaim than Bohemian Rhapsody as a movie. It is so much better than Bohemian Rhapsody. There was so much emotion and heart to it. Dexter Fletcher's direction was so good and he clearly left some good ideas for this movie than Bohemian Rhapsody which he was not credited. The casting was superb led by an electrifying performance by Taron Egerton. He deserves an oscar nod for this movie. Jamie Bell also did a very good job. The musical scores in this movie was also very good. I hope this movie will win two or three oscars this season.,8,1,1,14 August 2019
A Star Is Born," A Star Is Born indeed.
","A Star Is A Born delivered two stars. Lady Gaga and a bright start to Bradley Cooper's directorial debut. A Star Is Born is a movie with many beautiful and engaging moments. It's starts off well and ends beautifully. Technical wise, Bradley Cooper did a great job in direction and the music scores were very good. I think it is worthy of an Academy award in some sections including Best Picture.",8,1,4,16 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel does not delivers what we expected.
","MCU's introduction to Carol Denvers is not that good to be honest. If I must say, it is the not-so-good MCU movie after Hulk and The First Avenger, which was a long time ago. It has good empowerment, visuals and comedy. But the script is not so good. Brie Larson has done well and so is Samuel L Jackson. I would recommend you to watch Captain Marvel as an ordinary superhero movie rather than watching it with great expectations of watching a Marvel movie. P. S. Wonder Woman is far better than Captain Marvel.",6,4,7,8 March 2019
Us," Completely over rated.
","I don't know why every critics and some audiences liked this movie very much. This is nothing like Get Out. I expected so much from Jordan Peele after Get Out, which was a masterpiece. I didn't like the story of Us and the execution in most of the parts apart from the climax fight and the incredible bgm. There are no scary scenes in Us. Lupita Nyong'o did an excellent job and I agree that she may deserve an Oscar nomination for her performance. The cinematography and bgm was also good. Apart from that, Us is dull and I don't recommend it.",5,1,2,15 June 2019
Knives Out," Pure entertainment.
","Knives Out is that movie which will entertain us even after watching the movie. This is a movie we cannot stop thinking about even days after watching it. And the movie is even better when you watch it again and again. I knew this was going to be a good movie and Rian Johnson provided more than what we expected. The stellar ensemble cast did a superb job. All do them were good but Daniel Craig, Ana De Armas (her best performance till date) and Chris Evans. The movie is made perfectly and I can't wait to watch the sequel if it's anything like this. Kenneth Branagh's Murder On The Orient Express was good but would've been great if it was made like this. I hope Death In The Nile is more like this.",9,1,4,13 February 2020
The Irishman," Sadly, this maybe an end of an era.
","What a team they have been, Martin Scorcese, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino. All almost retired after giving us movies to cherish for our lifetime. This is one of the best Martin Scorcese movie ever. To include in that list, it must be a very good film as it contains some really good movies. All the performances were so good that all of them deserves an oscar nod. The 160 million budget can be seen in the film as all the three lead actors were so real in their younger versions. The Irishman is a must watch cinematic event of this decade and one of the best movies of the decade.",9,3,10,7 December 2019
Aquaman," DCEU back on track.
","We all wanted DCEU to be good like MCU. Wonder Woman is the only decent movie so far in DCEU. Aquaman has helped DCEU to be back on track. It has a very good plot, excellent visual effects, brilliany star cast etc. Overall it is a decent movie. It is not like any movie in MCU in my opinion as some said it is similar to Thor. Aquaman has it's own style of narrative and place comparing to any other super hero movie. Jason Mamoa did a very good job but it is Amber Heard who stole the show. She's a real bad ass as Mera. Watch Aquaman in the best theatre in your town. It is worth watching and you will have a very good time.",7,2,4,16 December 2018
BlacKkKlansman," One of the best in this genre.
","By this genre, I meant the movies telling racism prevailing in America. The movie starts slowly but ends perfectly.",8,11,23,24 November 2018
Fargo," A thriller made in a humorous way.
",The Coen brothers did a fantastic job. Frances McDormand was just fantastic in her role. I won't say it's one of the best films ever. But it sure is good.,8,0,1,27 October 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody will rock you.
",Bohemian Rhapsody is driven well by Rami Malek's outstanding performance as Freddie Mercury and the legendary songs by queen. It has very significant historical inaccuracies buy it is necessary for this well written biopic. All the cast has done a great job but Rami Malek gave us a career best performance and by which we will all remember him. This may be not Freddie Mercury's real life. But Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the best movies of the year and a great tribute to a great legend.,7,1,2,27 January 2019
Bird Box," A poorly executed movie.
","Bird Box have great potential. It could have been a great movie like A Quiet Place with a good direction and screenplay. Bird Box lacks this and falls out to be a bad movie. The performances where also not so good. Overall, Bird Box is another Netflix movie which we should forget.",4,3,10,25 December 2018
The Shining," Thrilling all the way.
",What a performance by Jack Nicholson. We should see only this movie to know that he is one of the best ever. His performance makes us forget about the ugly and really bad performance by the lead actress. The Shining is a good cookie for horror movie fans. It will be an okay cookie for everybody else. Certainly not bad.,8,0,5,25 October 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," What a movie!
",Spider-man Into the Spider-verse is the best spiderman movie till date. The making of the film is just excellent. What a try! Looking forward for more spiderverse sequels. One of the best animated movies ever and undoubtedly the best of the year. Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs falls out second to this masterpiece.,9,1,4,21 February 2019
Dangal," A must watch.
","One of the best Hindi movie and the best in the past two decades. The movie is not just a sports movie. It has comedy,drama,thrilling moments, and is a must watch for all the people around the world. Aamir Khan is again proving that he's the king of Bollywood. Aamir Khan lives as Mahavir Singh Phogat. He simply is the best actor of the year. All the cast did an excellent job. The direction,cinematography,music,stunts,screenplay,dialogues, everything is just perfect in this movie. Don't miss this movie. A must watch.",9,1,2,21 May 2017
Yesterday," A heart warming movie.
","Yesterday has a very interesting premise to start with. It's a very fresh idea and I haven't seen anything like this before. Yesterday is a musical fantasy but it's more a romantic comedy. The writers and Danny Boyle gave importance to rom-com than exploring the main idea of the movie. It could have been a lot more good or lot more worse if they explored it more. But still, you'll get a cute rom-com with very good performances and very good songs. I personally liked this movie and I recommend this to everyone who likes rom-com's.",7,0,0,28 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An epic conclusion to a 11 year running saga.
","There were many theories of how the remaining Avengers will reverse Thanos's snap. But I am pretty sure no one has predicted this is how the endgame would be. It is funny and emotional. This movie is one of a kind just like LOTR, Harry Potter etc. The first phase of the 180 minute long movie is slow and funny and the second phase is fast and funny with a well emotional climax for this long saga. The final battle of Endgame maybe the best battle scenes in cinematic history. The humongous cast did a well job as always and the cinematography is also perfect. Endgame was an once in a lifetime experience to me as I have watched all the 22 films over 11 years. The Avengers will continue, but it will be very hard to put something like these 3 Phases.",9,0,5,26 April 2019
Climax," A trip you should decide to take or not.
","Putting simply, Climax is a movie that many people will like and many people won't. I didn't like the movie. It was a good experiment though. The cinematography, choreography and performance of Sofia Boutella are the only positives. Even though the movie is only 90 minutes long, you find it difficult to stay your chair. The first forty minutes are used for introducing characters and dance and I didn't like the way he did that. For a 90 minutes movie, you're just sitting simply for 45 minutes. The second half was full of long takes which was cool. Overall, it is like every experimental movie, you may like it or you may not.",7,1,2,3 April 2019
The Favourite," The Favourite is a riot.
","The Favourite is one of the best movies of the year. From it's 10 nominations and comparing with the other Best Picture nominees, I think The Favourite has a very big shot at the Oscar's most prestigious price. The Favourite's both technical side and performances are splendid. Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone were in a tight race for the best performance and I think Coleman won it just. The music and cinematography are very much soothing. The Favourite is that movie which we will never get tired of watching it again and again. Kudos Yorgos Lanthimos.",9,5,10,16 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A loving ode to 60s Hollywood.
","Wow. What an experience it was. Tarantino literally delivers everything one expects. It is funny, thrilling, and features very good dialogues like in every Tarantino movies. All the cast did an excellent job led by the super Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. They were truly phenomenal. Margot Robbie also did a good job as Sharon Tate. Watching OUATIH gave me this rare feeling which I cannot express in words. Maybe it's old Hollywood nostalgia. Overall, this movie is not for everyone but for true cinema lovers.",9,1,3,24 November 2019
Get Out," Good thriller with a very good direction.
",Get out surprises us by its strong and different plot.The leading actors has shown mercy to their roles. Direction is just excellent. The movie has some funny moments and has deals alongside the thrilling scenes. Overall a good must watch movie. The locations are suits the movie and always makes us thrilled.,9,9,17,16 May 2017
Aladdin," I really liked it.
","This is one of the best Disney live-action remake I have seen. Many people are comparing it to the original. I haven't seen the original and as a first time watcher, I really liked it. Its hard to make these remakes as good as the old one but they're doing it for the audiences who haven't watched the classics and a chance to watch it with today's graphics. Will Smith was perfect as genie and the movie was so much alive every time he was on screen. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott also did a good job. The only problem I felt was the graphics where bad at some scenes. Overall, it is a must watch for all kinds of people whether it's a family watch, friends watch or couple watch.",8,1,2,14 August 2019
The Lion King," The CGI is worth the watch.
",I haven't seen the original movie. I have just read a book in my childhood. So there's no comparisons here. The CGI and visuals were absolutely great. It's a very good story but the movie lacks heart. The Jungle Book was much better compared to this. It's still a must watch in theatres for its visual effects and a great score by Hans Zimmer.,6,1,6,20 July 2019
The Incredibles," A perfect animated feature.
","The Incredibles is one of the must watch animated movie. Even though it is released in 2004, it's visual effects is stunning.",8,0,0,3 December 2018
1917," One of the best film ever made.
","2019 is the year of some of the best films ever made. Parasite was a revelation. I couldn't watch 1917 in theatres because I was sick. I saw it in the largest possible format and the biggest screen I could find and it was totally worth it. This is a movie you should pay and watch. This is pure film making art. The direction, cinematography, editing, music, production design, makeup and costume, acting and all other departments were just simply perfect. I don't know which I liked more, Parasite or 1917. But I could say that I enjoyed both these films very much and these movies were one of the best cinematic experience I ever had. Hats off to everyone who worked towards this and to the soldiers who fight the wars.",9,1,2,17 March 2020
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Tries to fill in patriotism and is successful for that.
","Uri The Surgical Strike is a big chance wasted. Because with this script and this technological support, it could have been more. Director Aditya Dhar did over drama in some areas which was not at all fit for the mood of the movie. But still, Uri The Surgical Strike is a must watch for all for experiencing the marvellous surgical strike by Indian Army and the action choreography was good throughout the movie. Vicky Kaushal did an excellent job and all the other supporting cast was okay. It could have been a thorough class movie with another director. The final chapter still keeps us at the edge of the seat and except the over drama, all chapters were also good.",6,3,6,11 March 2019
Midsommar," Psychic and unsettling.
","Midsommar is nothing you have seen before for sure. Super talented director Ari Aster has so much to offer than from his first outing, Heriditary. Midsommar is purely crafted movie with some many visually beautiful scenes and background music. Florence Pugh was extraordinary in the lead role. Midsommar may not scare you. But it will definitely unsettle you. The final act of the movie is not so good in my opinion. But the excellent first acts and the setting up was really good. Overall, Midsommar deserves our eyes as it is a pure cinematic experience.",7,0,1,2 October 2019
The King," Slow-burn.
","The King is one of that movies which starts very slowly and picks up pace very fastly towards the end. The King is a well made character study. Timothee Chalamet gave a decent enough performance as King Henry V. Joel Edgerton was really good and his character is very likeable. The King gives some really good scenes which stays in our mind. Robert Pattinson is unforgettable in this movie and he has done so well in this small role. The war scenes are captured well and I really liked it. The background music is also very good which suits the overall tone of the movie and gives us that historical feeling. Overall, The King is a good movie and everyone who likes slow paced movies can definitely watch this.",8,2,2,4 January 2020
Beauty and the Beast," A visual treat,
","Beauty and the beast is a one time watchable movie for the visual treat the movies offers. The locations,costumes,cinematography and production designing is very good. Emma Watson charms as Belle. Luke Evans did a very good job as the negative character. The songs will not get us bored throughout the movie. This could win Academy nominations for visual effects and production design. The screenplay is not good enough for this entertaining plot. Still its a one time watchable for its visual treats.",7,3,7,20 May 2017
Joker," Slow burn character drama masterpiece.
","Joker is once in ten years movie. This is not a full comic book movie. It's just based on a comic book character. Joker is really slow (which does not bore us) drama which turns upside down in final act. Todd Phillips has done an excellent job in pushing Arthur Fleck into our minds that he will be in your heads for a few days. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal. One of the best performances ever by an actor. Robert DeNiro also did a goof job in a small role. The cinematography is so beautiful and captures Gotham and Joker really well. This movie will win atleast a couple of Academy Awards this season. Overall, Joker is a must watch movie and those who don't like this are just jealous how good it is. Move aside Marvel.",9,2,4,24 November 2019
It Chapter Two," An okay sequel.
","It Chapter One was fun to watch. It had many good moments and it was kids vs a killer clown, which is more interesting than grown ups vs a killer clown. It Chapter Two is long but does not bore us. There are no scary moments other than one or two jump scares. In fact, there is more humour than scare in this scary movie. James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, James Ransone did good job but it was Bill Hader and Skarsgard who stole the show. The making of the film is also good with some very good shots. Overall, this movie is watchable for the ones who liked the first part even though I'm sure they won't like this as much as the first part.",6,2,3,15 September 2019
Parasite," Masterpiece.
",This is cinema in its purest form. Parasite is pure art and that movie which we should recommend to people who don't watch movies and show them how good cinema is. Parasite is an exhilarating experience and a movie which scored full marks in every department. Bong Joon Ho is one of the best directors in the world right now with this masterpiece. The message the movie gives about different classes of people really strikes us and it was done by some very powerful performances. The whole cast deserves our applause. Parasite is that movie that we won't forget about for a long time even if we watch it only one time. Hats off.,10,16,25,8 January 2020
Marriage Story," Heartbreak of the year.
","Marriage Story is a simple small movie. It tells about a couple who is getting divorce. What makes this movie big is everything that a good movie will have. Great acting, direction, music, dialogues, story etc. Noah Baumach proves that he is one of the best directors today. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver definitely deserves an Oscar nod for this performance. This is my favourite Scarlett Johansson performance till date (I haven't seen Jojo Rabbit yet). Laura Dern also deserves applause for her supporting character. The music had great impact in some scenes which we will not forget like the gate closing scene, Adam Driver crying in the final parts etc. Overall, Marriage Story is one of the best movie of the year and it definitely deserves your watch.",9,5,8,8 December 2019
Creed II," A far better sequel than expected.
","I didn't expect a sequel to Creed that is on par with the it's predecessor. I thought it would be just an okay movie. But Creed knocked all my thoughts down. Creed makes us sit at the edge of the seat. It is so intense and entertaining. The cinematography is so good especially in the boxing scenes. The performances were so good from the main leads and it was so good to see Dolph Lundgren back in the iconic role. Sylvester Stallone was as good as always and Michael B Jordan and Tessa Thompson were outstanding in their respective roles. Overall, Creed II is a good watch for boxing movie lovers and even better for Rocky fans.",8,0,1,17 February 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Taika Waititi is one of the best directors in Hollywood right now.
","JoJo Rabbit is a brilliant and brave attempt by Taika Waititi. This movie is crafted by pure creativity. 'An anti hate satire' is the tagline of the movie and the movie shows the Nazi era difficulties through humour and mind blowing dialogue (most from Scarlett Johansson). This was the year that I realised ScaJoh is an excellent actress. All of the cast was excellent including Roman Griffin Davies, Thomasin McKenzie (who both have a bright future), Taika Waititi, Rebel Wilson and an excellent Sam Rockwell. The fat boy also deserves mentioned. JoJo Rabbit deserves acclaim and more people should see it. I don't know why most of the critics hated it but screw them. Jojo Rabbit deserved that Oscar nod for Best Picture and even though there's no hope for winning it, I'm pretty sure the movie has inspired so much hearts and this movie will discussed in the future.",9,61,96,5 February 2020
Green Book," Green Book is so smooth and warm.
","Green Book is about the friendship between Tony Lip and Don Shirley. The movie is taken so beautifully. Viggo Mortensen and Mehershala Ali did an excellent job and I hope the latter will win his second oscar. Green book makes us feel good all the time. Watching this movie felt so good and an unique experience. Overall, Green Book is a must watch beautifully directed film. Hats off to Peter Farrelly.",9,1,2,21 February 2019
Da 5 Bloods," Da Spike Lee joint.
","Da 5 Bloods is not as good as Spike Lee's last movie, BlacKkKlansman. But this movie is very entertaining and has Spike Lee's artistic touch all over it. I didn't like the starting phase of the movie but as it went along and when the story unfolds slowly, it began to take my attention. The music and the cinematography is very good and the shots in Vietnam forest was very good. The performances of the whole cast was top notch and some deserves Oscar recognition. As for the whole movie, eventhough it may get nominated in some category, I don't think this will be in the Best Picture nominee. Nevertheless, Da 5 Bloods is a good movie that you should watch in these difficult circumstances. P.s. what a coincidence.",7,24,52,12 June 2020
Incredibles 2," One of the best sequel ever.
","The Incredibles 2 is as good as it's predecessor and lives up all the expectations. It's funny, thrilling and Jack-Jack steals the show.",8,2,6,7 December 2018
