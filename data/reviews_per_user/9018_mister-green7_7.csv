Men in Black 3," something is missing again
","ahh something again is missing from this movie. What is it? oh wait, its Tommy Lee! Duh. The magic or pull of this movie franchise is the great chemistry between Will and Tommy; so why take Tommy away? It wont work even if you try to substitute it for a younger and different actor of Tommy. Yes I know this movie cost a lot to make already, but you ought to spend the $$$ digitizing the original Tommy to look younger. 'Benjamin Button' Tommy so to speak. But no. Lets try hiring a younger actor. And what happens? The movie bombs (how the hell it can get a 7 rating now I don't know, but movie studios can always go on IMDb and press the 10 ratings button a million times, no sweat). A great movie is how memorable it can be. Sadly, I don't remember much after watching this movie. And the part where Tommy suggest to have some pie as to find a solution to a big problem, seriously, who wrote this stuff?",3,3,7,3 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," don't fix it if its not broken...
","After reading some reviews on here, some are dead spot on - why watch (or remake/reboot) something that has already happened before fairly recently? Its all too familiar and its like watching a rerun - plus you are PAYING to watch a rerun and you should NEVER have to pay to watch a rerun. Even if its played by a whole different set of actors.I guess its down to my expectations before the movie - i was expecting the remake to be darker and true to life - just like what Nolan did to Batman, or Daniel Craig as the new 007. But if you darken spidey abit then it will not work, cause how can you darken a nerdy Peter Parker? Remember Toby being taken over by that oily alien in Spidey 3? Doesn't work, mate. You are veering off the track, fanboys and virgins don't like that.In my honest opinion, this 'reboot' has one and only purpose - for movie studios to generate loads of $$$ from us suckers... yet again.... HAH",3,2,6,25 July 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," a honest review
","a quick flashback of Wahlberg's stone like acting comes to mine before watching this new reboot about apes going... ape. I shudder abit. But I really really liked this movie because there no was no boring moments in the film. I was hooked onto it from the first minute and I think its the reason why A lot of people liked this film (and therefore receives a high IMDb rating). The film has a good flow. You will not doze off. Agreed? agreed? Go Watch It. Just don't let michael bay near this story.... But some bits of the ending were slightly disappointing, but not until the very end (that is until you realised they are preping it for a sequel, if any). And you just know that a half-buried statue of liberty will be in the sequel somehow eh? eh? eh? yaaah...",9,1,3,15 January 2012
Drive," its alright if you yourself think its a masterpiece...
","hey folks, i'm just submitting my review version on this flick. I gotta admit, when i first saw it, i was a little disappointed, but only because i was expecting loads of car chases and explosions (and I have no idea why i thought of that in the first place, so my bad). Anywho, second time of viewing it and I really really liked this movie; great soundtrack and cinematography. I mean, yeah, some parts do not make sense, but thats why we love to watch movies, as an escape from reality, even just for a short period of time. Gosling is perfect for the part. Reminds me when Keanu is perfect for his role in The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008). This movie has a great retro 'European' vibe to it. Brilliant movie.",8,0,4,24 June 2012
Prometheus," Contact (the Aliens remix)
","yes this movie reminds me abit of Contact starring Jodie Foster (except Contact is better) and had I known that Damon Lindelof of LOST had written this, I would not have seen it. Period. Yes, too many unanswered questions folks. But ohh, this would open up discussions right? Nah screw that, I have better things to do than to waste my time on Prometheus forums. I will look forward to the sequel, as Prometheus is made in such a way that it simply DEMANDS a sequel (clever writers). I mean, it did suckered in a lot of LOST fans, eh? But anyways, the Aliens mythology is much more interesting, so am not too disappointed in Prometheus 1. Go see it if you are a fan of ALIENS and want to feel LOST.",5,3,6,9 August 2012
Looper," almost unrecognisable Joseph Gordon-Levitt
","ehhh... maybe its just me that finds it weird that JGL is trying hard to act like a young Bruce Willis. JGL probably watched way too much Die Hard movies whilst researching for this role. Furthermore he got a fake Willis snout. Distracting. Oh yeah. Distracting. JGL can probably play himself (as JGL of some sort) and I am sure that will pass off as a Young Willis just fine in Loopey. This film also reminds me of DragonBall Z; baby Son Goku throwing some nasty tantrums yeeesh. But I would pay to watch a sequel to this TBH. Anyways, this film could easily score an 8.5 had it not been the Weird Willis impersonation from JGL.",6,0,2,8 November 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," awful
","I am puzzled as to how this movie can score a 6 out of 10 (at time of my writing). I mean this is proof that Bay has paid people to put up fake reviews for his movie, or maybe Bay himself is pressing the IMDb high ratings button HAHA hey you never know! Anyways, Bay, also known as Michael 'oh-look-at-meee' Bay - needs a lot of supervision when making movies. He can shoot a car chase and military paraphernalia, but other than that, nothing else. I was traumatised as a kid way back in 1986 when I watched Optimus and his old skool Autobot buddies get killed in The Movie; sadly to say I am once again traumatised watching this Bayhem of a Transformers franchise. I am slowly recovering knowing the Bayhem trilogy has ended. This Bayhem franchise reminds me of when Batman was with Clooney and Kilmer; so hopefully the next reboot will be how Nolan did to the Batman franchise. Transformers Begins perhaps. Dark Robot? Cybertron Royale. You get the drift....",1,3,8,20 November 2011
