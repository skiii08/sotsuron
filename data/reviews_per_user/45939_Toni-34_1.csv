Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best movie to hit the Big Screen
","The Phantom Menace is the best movie I've seen since The Empire Strikes Back. Lucas' genius is once again revealed in this stunning addition to the already popular Star Wars family. I've seen the movie several times and plan on seeing it many more. The acting was top notch and casted perfectly. Lucas' brilliant team of CG artists and model makers have truly created a masterpiece. A must-see film for people of all ages, fans of Star Wars or not. And now I anxiously await Episode Two.",10,0,0,29 May 1999
