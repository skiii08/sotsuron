The Blair Witch Project," Overrated load of nothing!
",Pretty lame. Can't recommend it at all. Scary? Come on! If you're five years old maybe. What was good about it was not the movie but the marketing which was definitely inspired and original. The one hour pseudo-documentary that I saw on TV definitely suckered me in. Made me want to see the movie because I thought it was based on actual events. And I'm usually a pretty cynical person. Then I saw the movie and was very disappointed. Only thing worse is 'Book of Shadows: Blair Witch II.',Null,0,1,17 September 2003
