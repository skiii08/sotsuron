The King's Speech," An outstanding reconstruction of how a small man made a great king
","This masterfully crafted and splendidly acted slice of history, reminds a nation ever more forgetful about its Royal Past, how the 2nd son of Prince George V - after being forced to ascend the throne when his brother abdicates to marry a recently-divorced commoner - had to overcome a terrible speech impediment to unite his people against its common enemy at the outbreak of World War II, and in doing so became one of the great symbols of faith and hope during the war. All the secondary roles are impeccably cast, although Timothy Spall's obvious imitation of Winston Churchill does tend to distract you from the real story. But this is Colin Firth's movie all the way, and he gives an unforgettably sensitive, dignified and utterly believable portrayal of a man who has to over come great demons from past and present and comes to realize that he can only do that with the help of the man who was to become his greatest friend: Lionel Logue, played with great wit and an unusual restraint by Geoffrey Rush, who also shines in this fascinating drama. His chemistry with Firth makes Firth shine even more, and that is the sign of a truly great piece of acting. It helps if you know the historic importance of George IV's speeches, but this film will move you with or without that knowledge.",10,2,4,19 February 2011
300," 300: the number of times you will think of no sitting this one out
","This is as close as you can get to 'pretty awful'. There is virtually no script and the dialogue is simply laughable, with lines like: 'they look thirsty'(which makes absolutely no sense at all) followed by the 'immortal' lines:'Let's give them something to drink'. All in all, a very superficial script, bad dialogue and a lot of bloodspilling, mostly show with what I like to refer to as 'more frames than usual', causing virtually everything to be displayed in slow-motion, making the movie extremely slow, and, if you ask me, an awful bore. The voice-over explains everything we see, simply because someone apparently felt that the actors weren't capable of portraying the emotions properly. Moreover, there are no characters at all to care about, so this is no more than a meager attempt to treat us at visuals - accompanied by very loud, and clich√©-ridden music - which are extremely repetitive and hardly - if at all - worth taking too much time out of you life, when you really could be doing something useful. This will definitely work better if you play it fast-forward, then you won't have to hear the obnoxious dialogue. Mind you, some female nipples are flashed prominently here and there, but that's the only thing that prevents this from being the absolute bomb...",2,4,11,23 March 2007
