The Blair Witch Project," Awful - At 82 minutes, it's 81 minutes too long
","What were all those critics thinking when they reviewed this movie? I was in a full theatre to see this movie, and at the end, the audience was literally stunned to silence at how bad it was. I only heard one positive comment, and I think she thought she would be unfashionable if she didn't like the film.Although I like edgy films, I think a serious fraud has been committed on the movie going public with this one.It's almost pornographic - no redeeming social value.",1,2,3,6 August 1999
