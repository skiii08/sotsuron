The Blair Witch Project," Genius film making. The scariest movie I have ever seen.
","I had the honor to see this movie at the Sundance Film Festival.  This is the most genuine scary movie out there.  The great thing about this movie is that is it totally believable.  There is no extremely heroic character, or any big special effects.  This movie captures your imagination, making you one of the characters.  This movie made me laugh, cry (honestly), and tremble with fear.  If you're looking for a scary movie, this is it.",10,7,16,1 February 1999
The Thin Red Line," This movie never ended.
",While I enjoyed the representation of life at war... this movie could have ended in 20 different places.  It just seemed to go on and on.  People in my theater applauded when it was over.,4,0,0,17 January 1999
