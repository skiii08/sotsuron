The Ring," Boring
","Never underestimate the ability of the most boring, to just plain bad, films to become big franchises. Now, I've seen 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', 'Ring 0', and 'Rasen', and the only one I thought to be worthwhile was 'Ring 0: Basudei'. The others ranged from boring to just plain silly (I'm thinking 'Rasen' in particular here). I was apprehensive in watching 'The Ring', and thinking about how most remakes seem doomed to failure, what could 'The Ring' offer in entertainment value? In the end, it wasn't that bad. Of course, it wasn't that good either. It ended up being an amalgamation of 'Ringu', 'Ringu 2', with various Hitchcock moments thrown in and a sub-plot about horses thrown in, which leads me to: THE HORSES! WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE HORSES. I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.So, apart from the sub-plot about the horses, 'The Ring' is just another journalist investigating a cursed tape. I can't think of any other movie series that involves a cursed tape, so originality points would go there if there hadn't been five different versions of 'Ring' in Japan already. If I wanted to curse everyone with a tape, I'd just project onto the large-screens you see in city centres, allowing for maximum curse-age.Apart from the lack of any scares for most of the movie, my biggest problem with 'The Ring' was the character of Aidan. You know who he reminds me of? The kid from 'The Sixth Sense', and a bunch of other kids just like that kid. I really hate any movie-kid like Aidan. I would gladly trade him for Homer Simpson's talking-pie or killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason, if only there were no more kids with super-natural powers, or kids who seem to know everything about the occult.'The Ring' isn't that scary - it didn't even improve on 'Ringu', which wasn't very frightening either - and ended up disappointing and boring - 5/10",5,1,2,3 February 2005
Spider-Man," The awesome power of Sam Raimi and Stan Lee
","Sam Raimi is awesome. Stan Lee is awesome. Stan Lee created Spider-Man, who is awesome. And then Stan Lee had a love-child with Sam Raimi - it was the long awaited 'Spider-Man' movie, and it was awesome. Sometimes even I don't understand what I'm talking about.Growing up, I was a fan of the 'Spider-Man' cartoon that ran from 1994 to 1998. It was awesome. I never really collected the comics, I read the occasional one, and I still do, and the games on Super Nintendo were fun. One day, I picked up a Spider-Man comic, and at the end was a page from 'The Daily Bugle', announcing that 10 years of legal battles were over. A 'Spider-Man' movie would be made. I was so happy, that my head nearly exploded with happiness. Thankfully, any head explosions were avoided. I still don't quite understand what I'm talking about.Onto the movie. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a science-geek who doesn't fit in at school, and whose only friend is Harry Osborne (James Franco), the son Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), a scientist and head-honcho of his own company. On a field trip (to genetics laboratory of all places), Peter is bitten by a spider (a genetically enhanced 'super-spider' no less). Naturally, instead of any negative side-effects, Peter finds he now possesses spider-like powers. Meanwhile, on the evil side of town, Norman Osborne is working on a chemical human performance enhancer. With the threat of his funding being pulled, Norman tests the prototype out himself, and it works perfectly, save for him going rather insane. With a super-hero in town and no super-villains in sight, Norman dubs himself 'the Green Goblin' and runs off to cause some chaos.Any movie based on a comic is going to have mess around with the facts of the comic, the story, characters, order of events can't stay exactly the same. 'Spider-Man' is no different, but the core is the same. The reason for Peter Parker to be Spider-Man is there, the original moral of 'Spider-Man' is maintained throughout the whole movie - 'with great power comes great responsibility'. It was good to see the message was still there. Don't discredit it either, I can think of various examples where this message can be applied to the real world (American foreign policy, for instance).The acting is the strongest point movie. Tobey Maguire does the whole geeky Peter / uber-cool Spider-Man thing so well. If I said to Randy Savage, a pro-wrestler and rapper, what Spidey did, I'd probably be killed straight away. Willem Dafoe is great as the insane Green Goblin, ditto Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. Better yet, was J.K. Simmons who seemed to be J. Jonah Jameson to a tee, and Jameson is cool. Speaking of cool, Bruce Campbell has a cameo. It might not be as Ash, but its still the King, baby. Bruce Campbell is awesome. I'm not even talking about the movie anymore, am I? Unfortunately, the action scenes are the only real down point of the movie. Most of them very heavy on not-so-good CGI effects. I'm probably being a little unfair, as I think nearly all CGI effects are poor. That being said, I still enjoyed Spider-Man's showdown with the Green Goblin. Honestly, 'Spider-Man' never really seemed all that violent to me anyway, so it isn't much of a problem.Action aside, 'Spider-Man' is still one of the best super-hero movies out there. Worth a look for anyone - 9/10",9,0,1,18 January 2005
Die Hard 2," More action awesomeness
","Somehow, the original 'Die Hard' managed to be a smart and perfect action movie. 'Die Hard 2' is a bit of a step down. OK, who am I kidding? 'Die Hard 2' is dumb dumb dumb, and that's the way I like my action movies.It has been a year since John McClane (Bruce Willis) saved Nakatomi plaza, and he has since become somewhat of a celebrity. Waiting for Holly to arrive at Dulles Airport, things begin to feel a lot like Christmas when a terrorist group takes over Dulles Airport, leaving all in-bound flights - including the one Holly McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) is on - circling the airport and running out of fuel. Naturally, its up to John to take on the terrorists, cause some explosions, and save the day.So, the first thing to notice about 'Die Hard 2' is that the plot is much weaker than the first, and it is more explosiony. I may have just made that word up, but someday it shall be recognized as a real word. In fact, the plot is pretty much just a bunch of plot-holes and clichÃ©s, but that should all be normal to any fan of action movies. Part of what made 'Die Hard' so great was that McClane was not invincible. He was a regular guy, he felt pain, he doubted himself, etc. Seems as though in the year since Nakatomi, he has taken a magic potion to gain immortality or something. Sure, he occasionally shows emotions, but there isn't enough time for that in between all the flying bullets and explosions. As for the bad guys, the antagonists in 'Die Hard' were a small group, but they were smart. In 'Die Hard 2' we have - wait for it, take a deep breath - a rogue special-forces unit turned mercenary-terrorists, working for an ex-fascist dictator and drug-lord. That's like, every stereotypical action bad guy. Awesome.I don't think I've ever negatively criticized an action movie because of a weak plot or acting. All that is important to me is the action awesomeness of a given movie, and 'Die Hard 2' has plenty of action awesomeness. Regardless of inferiority to the original 'Die Hard', 'Die Hard 2', is still a spectacular action movie. Its fun, its exciting, and the final showdown is one the best fights I've ever seen.'Die Hard 2' certainly isn't the best movie ever made. Should appeal to action fans, and anyone else willing to suspend disbelief and watch and enjoyable action movie - 7/10",7,1,3,16 April 2005
Hero," Needs more Donnie Yen
","Here's something about myself that I still don't understand: I'm the kind of guy who thinks 'Hero' needed more Donnie Yen (in fact, all movies need more Donnie Yen), and who would recognize Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung from their appearances in Jackie Chan films. Yet when it comes to Zhang Yimou, I consider 'House of Flying Daggers' to be almost worthless and Yimou's earlier drama 'To Live' to be a much better film, more deserving of a place in IMDb's top 250 'Hero'. Honestly, 'Hero' is pretty boring.Thousands of years ago, China was divided into seven kingdoms, the most powerful being the Qin kingdom. The King of Qin (played by Daoming Chen) sought to unite / conquer all of China to enforce one land, one people, one written language, etc. The assassins Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) vowed to kill the King of Qin, but when the three assassins are defeated by a nameless official (Jet Li), Nameless is granted an audience with the King and asked to recount how he defeated the three great assassins.Now I don't mean to trivialize things, but 'Hero' originally appeared as a wu-xia rather than a drama, and it stars Jet Li and Donnie Yen and Siu-Tung Ching was the action choreographer. With such a line-up, how was I not going to expect a straight up as wu-xia kung-fu movie? Any fan of kung-fu movies would know that before 'Hero', Jet Li and Donnie Yen last faced off on screen in 'Once Upon a Time in China 2' (1992), and it is easily one of the best kung-fu fights on screen. Most of the action in 'Hero' is generally slow and boring. It definitely needed more Donnie Yen.People will tell me that I'm missing the point if I look at 'Hero' solely as a kung-fu film. Yes, I noticed all the pretty colours, and yes, I noticed the Kurosawa and 'Rashomon' style, but I still thought 'Hero' was rather dull. On the other hand, even though the ideology behind 'Hero' is arguable, I find it somewhat strange that a film that seems to support totalitarian ideology is so widely praised.'Hero' is a visually stunning film, unfortunately I'm not interested in that. It is a boring action film, and the message is somewhat questionable. It needed more Donnie Yen - 5/10",5,0,1,6 July 2005
The Evil Dead," Great
","In my reviews of 'Darkman' and 'The Quick and the Dead' I have mentioned numerous times of my appreciation for Sam Raimi and his movies. I have to say, that I think he is a stylish director and a great story teller.Now I have to admit that it was not until recently that I got to see 'The Evil Dead' and 'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn', despite Evil Dead being his first movie. I had seen the third movie, 'Army of Darkness', a while ago, and I really enjoyed it (come on, who didn't?), so with some widely available, and cheap DVD releases, I got the whole trilogy. Yay! 'The Evil Dead' follows a group of friends who take a trip to old, cheap cabin (two ominous signs there!). When they arrive, they find a cellar (ominous sign the third), and what appears to be abandoned research into the occult (fourth and final sign of evil). They play a recording of incantations that bring ancient demons to life, and now Ash (Bruce Campbell) and friends have to survive until dawn.If Bruce Campbell's comments supplied with the DVD were any indication, I wasn't looking forward to much apparently. Well, the acting was rather campy, but still a little better than what Bruce had implied, and the plot wasn't astounding or completely original. He forgot to mention the movie's special effects: rivaled, and beaten, by 1933's 'King Kong'. I wish I was joking here, I really do.Hey, I'm not holding any of that against 'the Evil Dead'. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were unknown to Hollywood when the movie was in production, and the budget was very small, yet they came up with one of the best horror movies ever made, and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The way the film is shot, and some of the better moments of acting, maintain a dark atmosphere and manage to keep the movie suspenseful. However, I didn't know if the special effects towards the end were supposed to disturb me or make me laugh at the cheesiness. That's my only real complaint about the movie. I did want to see the Ash from 'Army of Darkness', but now I see him as a male version of Ripley from the 'Alien' saga - terrified at first, calm and casual at the end.8/10 - Not for the faint of heart...",Null,1,3,29 December 2004
Die Hard," Excellent
","'Die Hard' - a near perfect action movie, and one of Hollywood's most influential modern-action movies. The movie follows a simple formula, a formula which has been repeated over and over again since 'Die Hard': A cop finds himself in the middle of a terrorist plot, with many hostages involved and no escape.In this case, John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York city cop, has flown to California to spend Christmas with his family and try to fix up his relationship with his estranged wife, Holly Generro McClane (Bonnie Bedalia). Holly works for the Nakatomi Corporation, and her boss has invited John to the office Christmas party, and he just happens to be out of sight when European terrorists take the party goers hostage. With John locked in, and the police locked out, its up to John to save the day.Simple plot formula aside, the movie is well written and well directed. The way the story progresses is great, and should keep anyone interested all the way through. The actors are great, 'Die Hard' still easily being Bruce Willis' best movie. He isn't some dumb, macho cop who shoots first and asks questions later - he is smart, and despite his brave front, he is just as scared as the hostages. Credit to Alan Rickman too, for bringing the villain Hans Gruber to life. 'Die Hard' easily outshines director John McTiernan's other great efforts in 'Predator', 'Hunt for Red October' and 'Last Action Hero'.All that and I still haven't mentioned the action yet. Running over two hours, 'Die Hard' is a bit long for a regular action movie, but this no regular action movie. Sometimes there will be action-free periods of time as the plot further develops, but the film is still action packed, and features some very cool action sequences, and the obligatory action one-liners are gold.'Die Hard' - an excellent action movie - 10/10",10,1,2,29 December 2004
Army of Darkness," Best of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy
","Following on directly from 'Dead by Dawn', Ash and his Oldsmobile fall out of the sky, and are trapped in 1300 AD. Ash is captured by soldiers, thinking Ash is a soldier of their enemy, Duke Henry. Well, they throw Ash in a pit with a deadite, Ash kills the deadite, and now everyone thinks he is the hero from the prophecy - the hero will fall from the sky and stop the Army of Darkness.Only the Necronomicon can save the middle-ages-dudes from the deadites, and send Ash back to his proper time, so its up to Ash to find the Necronomicon. Of course, there are some... complications in his quest.'Army of Darkness' takes the 'Evil Dead' series in a whole new direction. The horror and gore is gone, replaced by comedy and fantasy. Some other reviewers have already hinted to the best way to describe this movie: Campy b-movie inspired by older fantasy movies ('Jason and the Argonauts' in particular'). If you enjoyed the first two 'Evil Dead' movies, don't expect much of the same style in 'Army of Darkness' - the 'Evil Dead' style is all but gone. Except for Ash. Ash is King.However, there is nothing to be disappointed about. 'Army of Darkness' is a very funny movie. Well written, some really cool special effects - even the acting is better, and this a schlock movie! Simply put, this movie is basically the adventures of the Cult-God Ash, Hail to the King! Ash wanders around kicking deadite arse, equipped with the best lines ever written, and generally being awesome. Seems like this was the perfect role for Bruce Campbell.I haven't seen the original ending, but to the S-Mart ending I deem:Coolest. Ending. Ever.9.5/10 - My favourite of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy, and nearly fun for all ages! Almost...",Null,3,4,30 December 2004
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Die Hard: With Awesome
","'Die Hard' was awesome because it featured an action hero who was vulnerable and had weaknesses, unlike most action heroes, and all the action was limited exclusively to the one setting. 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance' is awesome because it completely dispensed with anything that was unique about the first, and turned into an awesome action movie, completely different from the action awesomeness of the original. Awesome.A terrorist named Simon threatens to bring New York to a standstill. Specifically asking for John McClane (Bruce Willis), Simon plays 'Simon Says... or a bunch of bombs explode' with McClane. In short, it's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas for the hungover McClane.John McTiernan returns as director after Renny Harlin directed 'Die Hard 2'. If you ignore 'Rollerball', McTiernan is a rather awesome director of awesome action movies. Like I said, McTiernan dumps the formula from the first and second, and takes 'Die Hard' in a totally different, but just as awesome, direction. The story may be as solid as the first, but the massive gaps in logic from the second don't really appear in the third. Well, they do, they just aren't as massive.As an action movie, Die Hard 3 is one of the best. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson get to run around New York trying to foil the bad guy, and generally causing chaos where ever they go. For a series of gun fights and explosions, Die Hard 3 is actually pretty exciting.While it still can't beat the original, Die Hard 3 is a great sequel, and is a little better than the second. As awesome as it is, it is probably only for action fans though - 8/10Awesome count: The word 'awesome' was used 9 times in this review.",8,2,4,26 May 2005
X2: X-Men United," Wolverine 2
","Wolverine is back! And so are the rest of the X-Men, I guess. This time around, we have a new bad guy, and some new X-Men.'X2' opens with a teleporting mutant attacking the White House and making an attempt on the President's life. Instantly recognizable to anyone who reads the comics, this new guy is Nightcrawler, and he seems to be under some sort of mind-control. Soon after, the Xavier Institute is attacked by General Stryker, a mutant-hater who seems to know secrets about Wolverine's past. The X-Men are scattered, and Professor X missing, they must team up with former foes to find Stryker and stop his dastardly plans.It must have been hard to top 'X-Men', but Bryan Singer and David Hayter did it again. While 'X2' doesn't blow 'X-Men' out the water, it is better. With most of the characters already introduced and a longer running time, we get treated to a better story and some new characters, and even nods to the fans with a great many references to other characters, events, and places from the comics. The human / mutant bigotry remains the main theme, but this time the villain is a human with anti-mutant intentions, as opposed to the mutant with anti-human intentions from the first movie.Action and special effects are still top-notch. Colussus even makes a small appearance, and his metal skin is done very well. All the fight scenes are better, and Wolverine's final fight with (Lady) Deathstrike completely outshining the showdown between Wolverine and Sabretooth in the first movie. Other scenes (including Nightcrawler attacking the White House and the assault on the Xavier Institute) are exciting and executed perfectly.Unfortunately, I have a few more complaints this time around. Cyclops has even less screen-time than he had in the first film, and he is supposed to be the X-Men's leader! Like seemingly everyone else, I didn't like Halle Berry as Storm. She just isn't the wise, but powerful Storm from the comics. On a similar note, I didn't like the film's interpretation of Lady Deathstrike. She has one line in the entire movie, and should not be playing second-fiddle to General Stryker. I have a feeling she was thrown in just because of the association with Wolverine.Speaking of Wolverine, he is my favourite of the X-Men, but the movie does center around him again. Either make a Wolverine movie or an X-Men movie. In more Wolverine news, Kitty Pryde appears in one scene, just as she did in the first. She is another of my favourites, and I'd like to see her do a little bit more than appear as a nod to the fans.Overall, 'X2' is better than 'X-Men', but you really have to see 'X-Men' before watching this, especially for those who aren't fans of the comics. It has a nice ending, leaving room in 'X-Men 3' for one of the biggest story-arcs in 40 years of X-Men comics - 9/10",9,0,0,16 January 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A classic as far as slasher movies are concerned
","'A Nightmare On Elm Street' is frequently regarded as a great horror movie. The director Wes Craven is frequently as a great modern horror director, but I have to admit that I haven't seen most of his stuff. I'd rather take John Carpenter ('Halloween', 'The Thing') any day, but I will agree: 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' is a good horror film.The teenagers of Elm Street begin to have strange nightmares, and soon enough, the teenagers start dying in their sleep. When her best friend dies, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) becomes the next target of the dream wandering Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), but Nancy decides to fight back.When compared to similar teen-horror films from the time (such as 'Halloween', 'Friday the 13th', and 'the Evil Dead'), 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' is slightly more subtle. Granted, it is still a teen-slasher at heart, but it has this slight subtle edge to it, bringing it above the level of the average slasher. 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' presents a good balance between slashing and playing to the mind. There is plenty of gore, but the audience is almost drawn to question Nancy's state of mind: Her parents have split up, her mother is an alcoholic, and Nancy has been going days without sleep. She can't be in her right mind, and this is what gets to us. Nearly anyone who managed to see this as a kid will tell you that this is the kind of movie that made them want to sleep with the door open, or with a night light.'Nightmare On Elm Street' is by no means perfect though. As with most slashers, there is that element of predictability. Any avid horror fan will be able to guess, with some degree of accuracy, who will die and when, and the conclusion. Like most slashers, the actors aren't the greatest and the dialog often turns into pure 80s cheese.In a generation of teen slasher flicks, 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' was one of the best. Shame about the the sequels though - 8/10",8,0,0,12 July 2005
Gangs of New York," Very long and oh so boring
","7.3/10? An epic? A masterpiece? I must have seen a different a movie. Now, I might be some uncouth lout who seems to watch nothing but action and horror movies, but I also enjoy studying history, and so when I was told that I would enjoy this because it is some 'historical epic' that starts off with a bloody battle, I just could not resist. I got screwed over. 'Gangs of New York' ended up being one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.I wish could discern a story in this. I really do. I am interested in studying history, but I know nothing of American history. Apparently in the 1860s, certain sections New York were run by criminal gangs. I can only assume that not much has changed, thanks to much more entertaining movies like 'Escape From New York' and a little known Italian movie called '1990: The Bronx Warriors'. Against a backdrop of gang-warfare and the American civil war, Leonardo DiCaprio does what he does worst: acting. For two and a half hours, apparently seeking vengeance against Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis), the man who murdered his father, with Cameron Diaz thrown in for eye-candy.Why does this need to go for over two and a half hours? Why bother with dragging something out with all sorts of themes and historical backdrops when you can have a simple 90 minute story of vengeance. That would suit me fine considering that '90 minute revenge story' could describe any number of old kung-fu movies from Hong Kong, all of which are more entertaining than 'Gangs of New York'.More importantly, why Leonardo DiCaprio? Out of all the movies he has done, this one suits him the least. At least his fake Irish accent is funny. Cameron Diaz also fakes an Irish accent, and hilarity ensues. Her character seemed totally useless, except to attract more of a male audience, because we all know the action in this couldn't possibly do that alone. Daniel Day-Lewis is pretty good. In fact, he spends the whole movie wearing a top-hat, much like my hero Slash. If Slash had appeared in this, 'Gangs of New York' would have been a much better movie. Starring Slash, and directed by Sam Raimi. I can imagine the awesomeness now.I swear, Martin Scorsese must have convinced all the real movie-critics that he is some sort of infallible movie-God, but he can't fool me. Welcome to my world, Mr. Scorsese, the world of awesome. A world where your classic movies stand on the same level as the awesome-movies I generally enjoy, and where 'Gangs of New York' is a movie equal to 'Batman & Robin', only less entertaining.'Gangs of New York' is long and boring, with no redeeming qualities at all. It may be enjoyed by film-students or unquestioning fans of Scorsese, but not me. Call me low-brow, but I know what I like, and this ain't it - 3/10",3,5,13,25 January 2005
Evil Dead II," Better than 'The Evil Dead'
","'Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn' is essentially a remake of the original 'The Evil Dead', extended and made more professionally and with more experience than the first.Beginning with a short recap of the first movie, we join the sole survivor Ash. He is trapped in the cabin, slowly going mad as deadites torment him. Soon he is joined by Annie Knowby (the daughter of Professor Knowby, the archaeologist who recorded the incantations from the Necronomicon), Ed (Annie's boyfriend or something), a redneck named Jake and his girlfriend Bobbie Joe. Yup, Bobbie Joe...Now the forest has more victims to claim, and it isn't long before the deadites are back in full force. At first it seems like a rehash of the first movie, but as the events progress you can tell it is smarter than the first. Essentially the same story, but the horror scenes are better and more varied than the first, more comedy, the special effects are much much better. We also get to see Ash progress from the terrified survivor to the Cult-God 'Army of Darkness' Ash that we all love. Bruce Campbell rules. Going from the scared-pretty boy, Ash turns into the deadite-killing, one-liner spitting, King of Awesomeness.Hail to the King, baby. Sorry, wrong movie.'Evil Dead II' - better than the first movie - 9/10, still not for the faint of heart.",9,2,3,30 December 2004
