Come and See," I recommend seeing this one.
","A truly profound look at the short period of time during which a young boy is forced to face horrible things in Soviet Union during WW2. A gripping, poetic vision, that has a personal edge to it, unlike most Hollywood war films.",10,4,7,14 May 1999
Taxi Driver," Interesting film...
","*some spoilers* This film is a good example of what Scorsese and De Niro can do when they are given good material. Acting, music, editing, all help to create an interesting story. Many scenes in the film are very strong in the way that they stay in the viewers mind long after seeing this film. I remember the, apparently authentic, scenes in the beginning of the film that show the streets and although very brief they create a sort of feeling of authenticity that sets the tone for the film. I remember reading that Scorsese had to use authentic footage because they ran out of money making the picture. When it comes to the accuracy of the portrayal of mental illness in the film, I would like to believe that there are certainly worse efforts. The film tries to tackle the mental grey area that really isn't about sanity or psychosis but about the area between these two. I think the film puts more emphasis on the sane part of the human mind and on what that part allows. The film is far from perfect, but rather than as a documentary the film should be seen as a fictive story that is actually very close to reality.The last 3 minutes of the film that show the 'happy' ending to the story has bothered me. Rather than as reality the end after the shootout should perhaps be seen as Bickles' last thoughts because I think he dies. Why would everything be so rosy, certainly he would not be considered a hero after what he had done by any kind of court? The film is done almost entirely from the point of view of Bickle and that is what I think the ending and the film is about, the subjective experiences of this man and his life in this sometimes inhuman city.",10,0,0,19 March 2000
The Killing Fields," A reporter film
","I refer to this film as a reporter film since it reminds me of Salvador and some other similar films were reporters are the main characters and the film unveils through their reporting experience of the horrors of some country. The Killing Fields is not a very good reporter film, it doesn't have the effectivity of Salvador and also I have a personal dislike of Sam Waterston, I am not sure why this is so. Maybe because I have seen him in so many b-level tv-movies and shows such as Law&Order and his somewhat preachy posture in his films. The story is an important one and it deserves to be told but the film doesn't suck the viewer in very well, possibly this is due to the fact that the Cambodian/Kampuchean conflicts are not as widely known and filmed as is e.g. the Vietnam war. Anyway, I suppose the film is good in that it tries to tell an important story and enlighten the audience. Something that was said by an earlier reviewer caught my attention, even though the film doesn't focus on the support that the NVA gave to Pol Pot and his movement I would definately not deem this film as false because of this. Also the fact that it was the Vietnamese army that finally toppled Pol Pot's reign is an indicator that he was not a very popular figure in the _very_ shattered sphere of communistic countries. I do not see this film as particularily anti-american or anti-nixon, the most poignant points are made about the actual acts of genocide committed by the Pol Pot regime.
Anyway, this film is a fictive tale of horrific events that still haunt the lives of millions of Cambodians. 5/10",Null,2,3,10 June 2003
American History X," The Klansmen
","****Spoilers*****AHX begins and ends with violence committed by the African-Americans against the white people, mainly the neo-nazis of the film. IMO this creates a kind of frame for this film that got me thinking about another film with similar narrative and semantic problems. The D.W. Griffith film The Birth of Nation, aka. The Klansmen came to my mind and back when that film was made there really was racism around, and guess what, there still is. Everyone remembers the glorious battle scenes of Griffiths' film but how many remember the horribly racistic depiction of african american slaves portrayed in that film.To me AHX suffers from the same symptom, trying to tell an epic story of some type but ultimately succumbing to racism because they simply hadn't done enough thinking about the subject matter that they had chosen. I really despise people who take everything that comes out of Hollywood as some kind of gospel that has to be studied and deified, IMO if it smacks of racism it's good to keep a distance to it. This film fails to say anything substancial about racism, it only succeeds in introducing the subject but it is as if the audience is being left waiting for a sequel, not because the original was so good but because the original failed to tell a good and complete story. And believe me, I have personally witnessed enough racism to know that one can easily make a really gripping and thoughtful film about racism, even without resorting to shock-tactics such as this film does.
This film reminds me of that tv-series Oz that tries so very hard to be 'topical' and 'philosophical' and 'gritty and in-your-face realistic' but fails to do any of them. Both, Oz and this film, only succeed in being a kind of soap opera that caters to the sick minds of the ones with an appetite for violence. Violence does not a story make.",1,85,188,17 September 2003
Zulu," A good film but needed more background.
","This is a film about a military outpost guarded by soldiers who are mainly from Britain and are attacked by a Zulu army. While the battle scenes are well done and the atmosphere stays tense the film is somewhat devoid of any real message. I could not completely enjoy the film because of the dated attitude it seems to have about the incident. The film has a Peckinpah-esque feel about it but it isn't able to show the whole story behind the events. Apparently the prequel sheds some light on the situation but there should have been more background in Zulu as well, granted that the film is as long as it is. If the viewer of this film knows about history, then this film can be looked at from other perspectives then just as a heroic tale of courage of the British forces.",Null,3,3,13 December 2000
Saving Private Ryan," B-movie about D-day.
","The more I think about this film and read differing reviews about it the more I feel it wasn't meant for me. I'm a Finn, not American. I don't know if Spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the G.I.:s, but to me that is what he made. All right the film does have something to tell for everyone: in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing, have courage to do it, that your actions have consequences, war as a whole creates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but nothing that has not been told earlier.And I suppose that isn't so bad, I mean there have certainly been worse films. But what does bother me is that Spielberg set out to do a film about what war is really like and to me, he failed. Yes I have seen the opening scene and to me it was more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action. Even if one would skip all the omissions and strange things about the film (in the landing scene no naval artillery support, no air force support and the illogical German tactics in the final battlescenes) to me the main plot is a strange curiosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasn't that interesting or important. Apparently with some links to reality the main plot remains distant and odd to me.With Oscar, block-buster, critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all the gore how could Spielberg go wrong? First of all the acting. Well I could not stop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used, maybe even amateurs. A lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes, it is good. Although to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much money to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more realistic. As ww2 films go this film is a far cry from 'Come and See'. Yes I do admit that flag waving is a common problem among ww2 movies, I just wished that Spielberg could have avoided it.",1,55,122,29 November 1999
Black Hawk Down," 'In Somalia killing is negotiation'
","Black hawk down does well with the depiction or war, it certainly is better than Saving private Ryan in every way. Visually it comes very close to the 'real thing' and seems very accurate. It is also very exceptional in that it conveys some tones unheard before, the tones that tell about the fallibility of the US army. This in my opinion is very good and healthy, critizism is always good. But the problems lie with the depiction of the crisis, the film makers are unable to take a good look at the crisis from the somalis point of view. Also I wish there could have been more emphasis on the futility of the situation because now the action in the film makes it too adventurous and Rambo-like. It also has a 'Readers Digest'-feel about it, with the moral being that Americans equal 10 or perhaps 100 somalis.",Null,1,1,23 April 2004
Singin' in the Rain," Good dancing...
","I like this film so I have nothing to say what others haven't said already. But I have heard that some of the dancing in SitR is very much influenced by some of the lesser known films with African American dancers doing the routines. As this in no way is intended as critique toward the film, it would be nice to see some of the acclaim go where it should go.",Null,2,5,1 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Not a big surprise...
","When I sat down in the movie theatre to watch this film I had a momentary vision. I roughly knew what the plot of this film  was going to be. I knew the ending too. And I could guess the last line as well before Nicole's character says it. And now I feel like this film didn't do anything that hadn't been seen earlier. The only thing that kept me really in suspense was to see if Stanley in his old days was going to break down in front of the commercial power of the starring duo and simply be happy to make a film without ambition. I hope that is the case since this film didn't live up to my expectations. I just didn't like the story. On the other hand one can defend the film by saying that everyone sees it differently and that many of Kubricks films draw their greatest strength from individual scenes and sometimes from individual images and that only time will tell if this is a good film.Kubrick has shown a lot of versatility in his career but somehow I have the feeling that acting has always been the weakest link of his films and although not a total failure Cruise and Kidman only manage to annoy me. I suppose the theme is sexuality and the Cruise character is in a way caught in the middle of this spectrum of sexuality and everything that goes with it. Sounds interesting but basically falls short of a good script. I didn't enjoy the music that much either. But even so the film is definately not bad, it is probably one of this years best films on the big screen.",Null,0,0,6 December 1999
Titanic," Good subject, poor handling
","I saw this one in the movie theater and kept cringing through the whole film. This film is so full of moments and actors etc. which done a little differently would have made me like the film, perhaps. The film isn't 'Gigli'-bad, it is fairly typical of Camerons new found style of making three digit milj. - budget films. I liked the original Terminator, it worked even if it sometimes looks a bit dated. The Titanic looks outdated already, and it doesn't have much going for itself except the remnants of the marketing campaign. 1/10.",1,10,21,20 November 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," Two thumbs up...
","I remember seeing this film in -92 and not being terribly amazed by it. With time though it has become a long time favorite of mine and I am yet to see such a combination of talent on a serial killer film as there is in this one. It is actually one of the few films that could have easily been a lot longer since the story had apparently been modified for the screen. The main theme of the film relies very strongly on the character of Hannibal Lecter and Hopkins should have had more screen time. In retrospect the script, which is well adapted from the novel, doesn't really offer anything new. Much of the story is to me pretty standard crime/serialkiller fiction. Otherwise all the other technicalities of this film are well done and especially the music by Howard Shore adds to the eerie mood. The film works well as a kind of horror/thriller combination. I hope that the sequel will have a good story and a good cast.",Null,0,0,13 December 1999
Heat," Face it...
","I really did not like this film much, I did not like the original tv version either. Still I guess I have to admit that it is mildly amusing, I was actually hoping that the De Niro character would get away with it. But setting that aside, the film is like a bad, naive western from the 40's or 50's that's been polished up and has Pacino and De Niro in it.",1,11,40,9 January 2000
The Thin Red Line," The better war film of -98...
","I think it is ok to compare this film with Saving Private Ryan, or with any other film for that matter. Together they show something about war but even more about typical, grand Hollywood productions. Where Spr tries to tackle the visual side of ww2, Trl goes for the more thoughtfull aspects. I felt that Trl was better of these two large, war spectacles that in my opinion should have done more in order to achieve any kind of place as classics in the more intellectually enlightened world of today. With Trl I occasionally felt that Malick would have done right if he had not tried to tackle all the characters from the novel, sometimes it is not the right way to go. The film could not ultimately take the story and the theme far enough to make me genuinely appreciate it. If there was a lot of footage shot that did not make the film it would be nice to see it included in a directors cut or a tv version, I'm sure that would give a more fuller picture.",9,1,5,12 January 2000
