The Benchwarmers," that was a waste of time
","The ending line of the movie was 'that was a waste of time'. And I think that was very very true. I felt really bad for those people who acted in this movie. It might send a message to the bullies, but I am not sure if they would get the message or rather try to bully people more. But overall felt really like I wasted my time and money on it.I went to this movie because all others were full and dint know what this movie would be like. Someone said its a funny movie so I thought of giving it a go. But it was not that funny and I was bored most of the time. The acting of the main actor was pretty good. I know he is a good actor and it shows. Except that, I dint see anything else that is good. 3/10 for good acting, 1/10 for the whole movie",2,0,1,3 June 2006
