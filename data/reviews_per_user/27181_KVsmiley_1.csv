The Blair Witch Project," Great movie
","If you like horror movies where you know beforehand that everything that you will see, is made out of plastic (e.g. Freddy Krueger, Jason, Halloween, Scream, etc.), don't go to this movie.This movies takes you onto a trip into your worst fear.  The fear of being lost and being haunted by something or someone and you will never know what it is.  The actors are great and they do as anyone would do in the given situation (cry, swear, quarrel, etc.).A comment I have heard a lot, is that the ending 'sucks'.  Why, this is the only ending this movie can have.  If you don't understand the ending, have another look at the movie and especially pay attention when the townspeople are interviewed.I just wonder how else this movie CAN end.I rate this movie ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,2,1 November 1999
