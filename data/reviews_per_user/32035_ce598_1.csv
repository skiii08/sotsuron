The Blair Witch Project," Boring
","Probably the most boring movie I've ever seen.  I kept on waiting for something scary to happen... it never did.  I spent most of the film hoping they would all just die and get it over with.  I would say that the ending was anti-climatic, but I didn't notice any climax to begin with.  I don't know what all the hype was for.",2,1,3,5 August 1999
