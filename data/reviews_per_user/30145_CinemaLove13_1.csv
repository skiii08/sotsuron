Iron Man 3," THE MANDARIN IS FAKE. I question reality.
","First of all the mandarin is fake. Shane Black may be the worst director of our time. Why on earth would you take the mandarin, one of MARVELs greatest villains and turn him into a British drunk guy?! When Shane Black sat down and started working on this film was he thinking 'hey I'm going to make iron man 3 the worst MARVEL film of all time. Oh and while I'm at it ill go ahead and make a joke of the mandarin'? I have no clue how MARVEL is going to recover from this tragic event. The only good thing about this 'film' is RDJ. I left the theater wishing it were just a bad dream and that when i awoke Jon Favreau would be the director. Shane Black shouldn't be allowed to direct a cereal commercial after what he did to MARVEL.The Mandarin is fake.",1,26,44,21 May 2013
