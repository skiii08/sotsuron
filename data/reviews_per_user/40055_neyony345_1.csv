Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner Strikes Back
","This is perhaps one of the best sequels to a sci-fi movie I have seen. In my experience, sequels rarely exceed the original, but this film does just that. That combination of great visual by Charlie Villeneuve and the exceedingly great casting and acting by Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Jared Let, and Sylvia Hoeks makes this film a must-watch not only for fans of sci-fi movies, but fans that love movies in general. The film is visually stunning, with great effects and cinematography that bring a dystopian Los Angeles to life on the screen. The story is amazing, and the audience is kept guessing throughout the movie. However, this movie is not without its shortcomings. In my opinion, the pacing was a bit slow to my taste and certain scenes throughout the movie were dragged out for a bit too long. However, these two shortcomings do not do anything do dampen the whole experience of the movie. If you are looking for a great action flick, look elsewhere. This film is a thought-provoking sci-fi film, and is a great break from all the action sci-fi flicks that have been released in the summer.",8,1,7,12 October 2017
