The Blair Witch Project," The Web site is more entertaining than the movie
","After weeks of reading the hype about this independent film that supposedly impressed audiences at the Sundance Film Festival, I finally found time to see it in Colma, California a town in which the dead 'residents' outnumber the living. After seeing this movie, I envied those dead people buried in the nearby cemeteries. They did not have to sit through 87 minutes of shaky handheld footage. Rather than a ghost story, the Blair Witch Project is largely a pseudo-documentary about three often-obnoxious Gen-Xers lost in the woods. We grasp their plight early in the film, so it's difficult to endure their bickering and histrionics after that point is made. By the time we arrive at the film's climax, most of us are glad to know that these tiresome filmmakers will be bound, tortured and disemboweled.The Blair Witch Project Web site actually contains more information than we see presented in the film. Web surfers are allowed to read the 'back-story' of the Blair witch and her lingering hold on the Burkitsville community. I was hoping to see some standard 'talking head' footage of the law enforcement officers and the private investigator who eventually located the personal effects of the missing filmmakers. I also expected interviews with the trio's grieving friends and relatives. While I normally dislike such cinematic cliches, in this instance, it would have been a relief.This film could easily be edited down to about twenty minutes of footage that could be presented as film clips within another documentary film about the filmmakers' disappearance (the film I expected to see).",1,2,3,7 August 1999
U-571," We all live in a yellow submarine...
","This movie has more in common with the 'Guns of Navarone' than it does with 'Das Boot,' 'the Bedford Incident' or 'the Enemy Below.' Technical and historical accuracy are sacrificed in the name of entertainment... so is any pretense of military discipline. It's an old-fashioned war movie in which the usual eclectic handful of Americans manage to beat the Axis villains (who have them out-gunned and outnumbered). If you're hungry for a mindless action-adventure movie, this is the fast-food 'meal' to satisfy that need. If you want something substantial to digest, look elsewhere.Matthew McConaughey's performance is decent, and Harvey Keitel manages to look good even though he's playing a cinematic cliche -- as are most of the enlisted men. Jon Bon Jovi appears too briefly for me to say whether he deserves that cameo on 'the Sopranos' that he so desperately craves.
If you're expecting an interesting story about the Enigma code machine, wait for someone to adapt Neal Stephenson's  Cryptonomicon for the screen. Of course that's about as likely to happen as 'Gravity's Rainbow: the Movie.'",6,1,3,23 April 2000
Being John Malkovich," Malkovich Club?
","The first rule about 'Being John Malkovich' is: See 'Being John Malkovich.' The second rule about 'Being John Malkovich' is: See 'Being John Malkovich.' This is the most original movie I've seen in a few years. (There are no huge explosions, and the lone chase scene doesn't involve cars, planes or space ships.) Unlike many 'art house' movies, I didn't need to struggle to understand or enjoy it. It's a film about human identity, a story in which a number of characters struggle to express themselves, to find fulfillment and to pursue happiness -- in ways that are rather bizarre.  They live in a skewed version of reality (either that, or New York City has gotten worse since my last visit).  We have passed through the looking glass, and some things are not what they appear to be.  The characters are interesting and well-developed. The humor is dark and incisive. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz are deep in character and barely recognizable. Catherine Keener is the ultimate femme fatale. Orson Bean is hilarious. John Malkovich is brilliant -- and very convincing -- as himself.",10,0,0,30 October 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Being Stanley Kubrick
","I first saw '2001: A Space Odyssey' in the fall of 1968. I was fifteen years-old. This was only months after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. There had been a police riot at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Richard Nixon was about to be elected President of the United States. The Vietnam war seemed to be getting worse -- the year had opened with the infamous Tet Offensive.I needed an escape from the grim headlines. (The only good news seemed to be the NASA Apollo mission that would orbit the moon in December.) Oddly enough, the director of Dr. Strangelove would provide that escape in the form of 2001. (Thanks to my viewing of Dr. Strangelove four years earlier, I believed that I would eventually be incinerated in a nuclear war.)
I had read about Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail, but I still wondered why it had taken half a decade to produce this new movie. Entering the theater, I had great expectations, but I would not be disappointed by what I experienced that night.I got to see 2001 in the old Cinerama format which used three synchronized projectors to display the movie on a wide curved screen. The effect was less impressive than today's IMAX, but it DID make things larger than life. The special effects were impressive without detracting attention from the story. The idea of humans achieving a higher plane of existence intrigued me. I would ponder the philosophical and theological implications of that alien-assisted evolution for years to come.I emerged from the theater feeling profoundly optimistic even though I wasn't quite sure what I had experienced. It was as if I had seen and touched the black monolith.It may have been 1968, but, for the record, I was clean & sober. Whatever I felt was the effect of the film, not any foreign substances. In retrospect, I can say that I was happier than someone who had been John Malkovich for 15 minutes.A few months later, I read Arthur C. Clarke's 'The Sentinel' because I was interested in the story that inspired the movie. Then, I borrowed a classmate's copy of Clarke's novelization.  I preferred the original short story. From that experience, I learned to avoid novels based upon screenplays.I've seen 2001 dozens of times since 1968. Three decades later, I can see the flaws in the ape suits. I can understand younger viewers' impatience with Kubrick's slow-but-deliberate pacing. I also admit that I do not always enjoy the film's score. I wish the DVD version could have offered Alex North's original score as an alternative. (I suspect there are legal issues preventing this.) However, I still believe that this is Kubrick's masterpiece.",10,1,3,29 December 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good but not great: Chris Columbus isn't pushing the envelope
","Readers seem pleased that the movie seldom strays from the book. Steven Kloves' screenplay seems to be a transcription of J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter novel. Unfortunately, this means that some adult viewers might be glancing at their watches as the movie slowly resolves the plot. I noticed that the film's length posed no problem for older children in the theater when I saw it. (The kids seemed to know the story, so there probably weren't many surprises for them.)  I must commend the screenwriter for doing his best with Rowling's major plot twist -- which I had found a bit awkward when I read the novel. I believe the story is character-driven rather than plot-driven, so the mystery is less important to me than the characters' arcs. I also believe that the story's wizardry is a MacGuffin. It's more important for us to see Harry, Ron and Hermione discover the value of friendship and loyalty than learn spells and potions.In his earlier movies, Chris Columbus demonstrates a knack for working with children, so I'm not surprised that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give excellent performances. (BTW, I am NEVER forgiving toward bad child actors.) Harry, Ron and Hermione must be likable and believable, and they are. Without the convincing work by this trio, the great performances by the stellar British cast would not have been enough to carry the movie.
If the rest of films in this series are of this caliber, they should be popular for years to come.",7,0,1,20 November 2001
