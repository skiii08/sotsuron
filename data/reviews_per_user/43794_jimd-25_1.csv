Captain Phillips," Good movie. Great acting.
","I'm not going to give away anything, but I think most people know the outcome of the pirate attack. What impressed me the most is the reality of it all. Everything seemed very realistic. A lot of movies deliver extreme action and violence, then the affected characters just walk away like nothing happened. Not this movie. You can really feel the emotion and mental stress that real people would be in, in that situation. Really great acting, and not just from Tom Hanks. The Somali pirates were just perfect.My biggest complaint would be that the movie was out of focus for at least 10 minutes. That was almost certainly the fault of the local theater.I gave it an 8 because I thought the movie was 7 but the acting was a 9.",8,2,18,3 October 2013
