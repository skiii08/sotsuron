First Man," What happened!!!!!!!!!! No American Flag?????????
","I enjoyed the show until the end when I realized they had not placed an American flag on Moon's soil. I only gave it 6 stars because of that. This was not only Neil Armstrong's mission, but America supported it and it allowed the world to share in an event. But it was America. Show a little pride Hollywood.
