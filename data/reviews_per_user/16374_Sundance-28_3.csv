The Blair Witch Project," Creepy!!!
","I just saw this film a couple of hours ago and the more I think about it, the more it really creeps me out! First of all, it's an incredibly inventive idea for a movie, filmed in an inventive way. Secondly, and more importantly, this movie is a real spine tingler. Especially the freaked out, albeit abrupt, ending. You actaully find yourself getting wrapped up in what these characters are going through. This movie does what every good movie should do, it entertains thoroughly and leaves the viewer wanting more. Not to mention it will scare the pants off of you! This is something most Hollywood movies don't have a clue how to accomplish. LISTEN UP ASPIRING FILM MAKERS: Special effects and cheesy monsters are not the way to scare people. The imagination is the scariest special effect of all.",9,1,1,31 July 1999
The 13th Warrior," A surprising treat...
","I was horribly mislead by my local paper concerning this movie. One of the many critics at the Kansas City Star gave it a terrible review, saying it was boring. That reviewer should be sacked, but not just for saying the movie was boring.After seeing the movie myself, I can honestly say that not only was it exciting and entertaining, but the reviewer made several mistakes in his review that showed he clearly either didn't see the movie or just didn't pay attention.My quibbles with him aside, I enjoyed The 13th Warrior. I thought it was an interesting, original adventure of the kind that is rarely made anymore.
If I have any problem with the movie, it is that the characters are a tad underdeveloped. We learn more about them through their battle scenes than anywhere else. But I came out not even knowing most of the characters' names (save Antonio's), much less anything else about them. However, a few personalities do manage to shine through the mud and blood.If you're up for a rip-roaring adventure with an interesting story, I highly recommend this movie.",7,0,0,28 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Wow!
","When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought 'ugh, here comes another bad Bruce Willis movie.' Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Bruce. Always have been. He just isn't too careful with the roles he takes sometimes (Hudson Hawk, anyone?). That, plus this reminded me of that other movie he did about the autistic kid and the government codes and all that fun stuff. Well, this is most definitely NOT that movie! I could not have been more pleasantly surprised by this film. I truly enjoyed everything about it, from the slowly building chills to the Keyser Soze twist of an ending (I never saw it coming!) But I was most pleasantly surprised by the performance of Haley Osment as Cole. This kid was stunning. It is a rare thing to see such an emotionally honest performance from one so young. Two things kept going through my mind as I watched this kid: One, he deserves at least an Academy Award nomination. (yes, he was THAT good!) And two, this kid SHOULD have been Anakin in that earlier summer movie that claimed to be about a phantom. If you're looking for some special effects laden horror movie, go see the Haunting. If you're looking for a few REAL chills, great acting all around and a great story...see this movie!",9,0,0,18 August 1999
