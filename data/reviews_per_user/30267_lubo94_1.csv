The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Loyal to the fans.
","Before I go to into detail, I would like bring notice on why and how the Twilight Saga has become the franchise that it is. The one and only reason why the Twilight saga has taken over the box office is due to its hardcore fans, aka 'Twihards'. So no matter what the films are classified as, they are still going to be successful and continue to smash box office records. So far Breaking Dawn part 1 has received a mixture of both negative and positive reviews but beginning to slightly tilt to the negative side. This could be explained by a few reasons. People should be aware that the Twilight movies are made FOR its loyal fans; ever since the first Twilight film, the directors have created the movies, exclusively to satisfy the 'Twihards' which is why just like the previous three Twilight movies, Breaking Dawn has its fair share of topless man, incoherent mutterings and plenty of teenage angst, which is why I believe that this movie to some people would be a spectacle and to others, a waste of time. Some of the most noticeable flaws in the movie are those in the script. At some points the dialogue was so irrelatively poor that some would guess that it was written by a bunch of nine year old children. This is where a few of the characters lost personality and became too vague. Two particular scenes that would make you cringe are two that were beautifully written in the book. The coherent flow in the book was nowhere to be found during the scene in which Jacob confronts Bella about her pregnancy and also during the conversation between the pack while they were phased. If this was to be improved, the majority of the feedback would have most likely been positive. Let's look at what director Bill Condon has added to this much anticipated sequel to the Twilight Saga. Condon has managed to capture the purity and endearment that was previously manufactured by Catherine Hardwicke and twist it in to his own odd, modern interpretation. Perhaps this is why the movie has ups and downs; most of the best bits are those that fall into the indie-drama class, the same class that Catherine Hardwicke used to skyrocket Twilight into our lives. Some of the worst bits are the ones that are irrelevant to the Twilight world, and that clearly belong to and should stick to the old Hollywood clich√© movies. Even the main actor and actress admit that their favourite twilight movie is undoubtedly the first one, which goes to prove that Hardwicke's recipe in the first twilight movie should have been applied to all other three movies. However something that Condon has added and has actually benefited the movie is his attempt to convey the transformation of the characters into mature adults, as the acting has never looked better. Breaking Dawn is essentially Bella's story. We dwell deeper into the teen's uncertain and passionate mindset as we discover a new side to Bella. Her newly earned motherly instincts have made her more feisty and independent which brings emphasis to her maturity. Kristen has managed to portray the teen's wide range of emotions exceptionally well whilst still remaining faithful to the book. This would also apply to a few other actors in the cast, as even the support actresses and actors have polished their acting skills. A good example of which actor who in particular stood out is Billy Burke (Charlie Swan); The new side of Charlie managed bring a few unexpected laughs, and show a more light-hearted side to Twilight, this new side was acted out shockingly well whilst still corresponding to Charlie's persona in the books. So overall I would say this movie will very much please its 'Twihards' as it remains very faithful to the book. If you aren't a Twilight fan, this may not be the case. Is this movie worth seeing? Yes. Is it the best Twilight film? No.",7,8,18,18 November 2011
