Minority Report," Cruise & Spielberg work magic in very 'matrixi' sci-fi thriller
","Very intelligent sci-fi thriller that follows in the vein of The Matrix and Blade Runner. Tom Cruise is perfect as Detective John Anderton, chief of D.C.'s Pre-crime Unit, who falls victim to a set-up he struggles to understand. Also, rising star Colin Farrell, yet again, displays his talent as FBI agent Danny Witwer, who is brought in to oversee the Unit's work.All in all, Spielberg has crafted a very stylish and modern film that challenges you to reflect on the future.IMDb rating: 8/10",8,0,0,10 August 2002
Chicken Run," Chicken Run ain't no Chicken Fun!
","What is it about this film that, apparently, has everyone cheering and giggling. I don't see it. I just don't. I mean, having watched over and over again the superior Wallace & Gromit trilogy one's entitled to expect a certain level of quality. However, Nick Park and Peter Lord fall terribly short with Chicken Run. It seems to me that the Hollywood influence (Jeffrey Katzenberg/Dreamworks) has been counterproductive in terms of the originality of the script and the depth of the storytelling.The animation, though, is splendid!IMDb rating: 6/10",6,0,1,17 October 2000
The Italian Job," Mark Wahlberg leads cast of diverse talent in crowd-pleasing heist flick.
","It's funny how the same movie can spark such different opinions. While many people seem to have a problem with this movie, I think it's an above-average, entertaining popcorn-flick. The acting is good throughout. And the story twists and turns enough to keep you involved, while keeping up the pace. And special praise has to go to Edward Norton for putting in such a quality performance, considering the well-publicized quarrels he had with the studio. You would never know he did this movie against his will.IMDb rating: 7/10",7,1,2,17 August 2003
The Patriot," Good... not great.
","As it turns out, one moviegoer by the alias of 'rrowell' has already said about this movie what needs to be said.'Really great dramas leave you speechless. Good dramas you leave wondering why your not. This was a good movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it was missing something. There is just something about a movie like Braveheart or (don't laugh) Titanic that just rips your guts apart. They made me cry, as where I never came close in the Patriot. The pain and the joy just didn't come through for some reason. At almost three hours long, I can't see myself watching it again anytime soon, as where I've watched Braveheart a dozen times, thrice in the theater. That said, it beats the hell out of 85% of the movies I see.'I couldn't agree more.",6,0,1,5 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Oops!... we forgot about the plot!
","I cannot believe how bad this movie is. Yes, the effects ARE well made and so are the action sequences. But, frankly, the movie fails profoundly in terms of compelling storyline and real suspense. John Woo has once again delivered a myriad of action but also a movie which's desperately looking for a plot.",2,0,0,27 July 2000
Pulp Fiction," What's all the fuss about?!
","What is it about this movie. Why do people hold it at such high regard. I simply don't get it... In my opinion the story is vague, the dialogue stupid and the performances, well, average.Certainly, Travolta made a bigger impression in the much underrated eighties suspense-drama 'Blow Out'. For great Sam Jackson performances, look no further than 96's 'A Time To Kill'.Besides, I didn't like the score either...",2,8,19,29 July 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," Lots of action - not much else!
","I'm afraid it never really got to Joel Silver what made the original Matrix such a success at the box-office. At least, that's the impression you get when watching this latest installment in the franchise. See, what I really liked about the first film was that not only did it have some amazing action sequences, more importantly, it also had a great and wholly original script, offering a very intriguing world vision. 'The Matrix Reloaded', however, fails to deliver equally on both fronts. Particular attention seems to have been paid to perfecting the visual aspects of the film -- and the results are impressive, I have to say. It just doesn't cut it. It cannot hide the fact that the basis of this film is a... well, pretty weak script. I definitely would have liked to see much more emphasis being placed on story, while cutting back on some of the action. That would have made for a much more engaging film -- catering to the MINDS of people, as well as to the EYES.Rather than joining company with films like 'Crouching Tiger...' and 'Minority Report', this Matrix enters the 'Blade'-category.Disappointing.",7,0,0,28 May 2003
The Green Mile," Good. Yet a bit too corny to really succeed.
","I liked this movie. However, I found it a bit too longish, and for some reason the aspirations of Darabont to make 'another one of those 'Tom Hanks movies'' were annoyingly transparent throughout the film. Praise has to go, though, to the entire cast which delivers very convincing performances.IMDb rating 7.5",7,0,0,10 August 2000
