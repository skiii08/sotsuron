First Man," An unforgettable event becomes a forgettable movie
","Have watched many very long, great movies it sometimes amazes me how quickly the time seems to pass in the viewing.This is not one of those movies, it seems to crawl along at a torturously slow pace. I found myself checking the time several times in the course of the movie.Part of the blame lies with the flat emotional tone held throughout the film by Ryan Gosling.In a review of the Day the Earth Stood Still remake that starred Keanu Reeves, Roger Ebert commented on Reeves' flat, seemingly emotionless performance. Comparing it to Michael Rennie in the original 50's classic, Ebert said Reeves made Rennie seem like Hunter Thompson at closing time.Gosling must have studied Reeves' performance carefully. A family tragedy torments him, and as a result there is a single emotional breakdown , but in the remainder of the film Gosling seems completely devoid of emotion. He is grayer than the lunar landscape he eventually walks.And that lunar landscape, and the authentic re-creation of the astronauts' other flights and missions is the only reason this film deserves a five-star rating.",5,3,6,15 November 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Better than the average rock biopic
","After reading critics reviews, I went into this movie not expecting much.As was the case with the band and its music, the movie is something the critics will mostly hate and the public will mostly love.The movie has its faults. And Malek is too small and not good looking enough to play Mercury. At times he looks ridiculous in his prosthetic teeth, as if he's struggling to just to keep them from springing out of his mouth.But the movie is entertaining and moving. The actors are very good in their roles, especially Malek in a compelling and tragic performance. And Gwilym Lee to my eyes is almost an identical twin to Brian May and his guitar performance is convincing.But, as one critic put it, the final 15 minutes of the film is alone worth the price of admission. The bulk of Queen's Live-Aid performance is re-created here in astonishing, electrifying detail. Malek channels Mercury's charisma, stage presence, and ability to completely connect with the crowd. It's a spellbinding and emotional experience to be totally immersed in this concert in a way that has you feeling as if your standing right on the stage.There are a few places where this movie could have been better, but those are all a distant memory when this jaw-dropping concert spectacle begins. Surely there are a few Oscar categories where these glorious minutes deserve recognition. If not, maybe, just maybe, they need to create a new category.",8,2,6,9 November 2018
