Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips; A good movie, but not for the faint of heart:
","Captain Phillips is a well-done but harrowing film that's based on a true story about the hijacking of an American boat by Somali pirates.The acting is good, the action gripping enough to keep people on the edge of their seats (I know I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!), but it's definitely not for the faint of heart, if one gets the drift. it was well worth seeing, nonetheless.The actor who played Captain Phillips played the part of the beleaguered captain with much aplomb and expression. So did the guys who played the Somali pirates who hijacked the ship. While I wonder what the United States was doing over in Somalia in the first place, I do feel for Captain Phillips and all the ships passengers, since the hijacking was such an ordeal for everybody on the ship.The fact that the pirates literally hijacked the ship and took over as Captain made me not feel sympathy for the pirates. Yet, I couldn't justify the killing of them in the end, either. One pirate did serve (or is serving ), a prison sentence here in the United States, and he should be.",8,0,1,30 March 2014
The Town," Ben Affleck's 'The Town'-so bad that it's good:
","'The Town' is an overrated, hyped-up, cheesy piece of junk, imo. It's more like a feature- length, made-for-TV soap opera than a regular movie, and is very cartoonlike with a poor to mediocre cast. None of the characters are believable except for Jeremy Renner's role as the crazy 'Jem' Coughlin, and Jon Hamm as Adam Frawley, the FBI Agt. who's been assigned to bring Doug MacRay and his men to their knees and to prison, once and for all. The beginning of 'The Town', with the opening bank heist and the aerial/on the ground shots of Charlestown and Boston, generally, was interesting, but it went from being okay to being just plain awful in a matter of minutes. The Town conveys the message to me, personally, that people don't have to be held accountable for what they do, and, as long as they get what they want, anything goes. A strong message that predatory behavior such as stalking a person, and associating with a person who shoots, kills and beats people within inches of their life is okay is also evident in The Town. So is the message that a woman who's very princess-like, demure and 'normal' and steals the heart of the de-facto leader of a local gang of thieving thugs can be petted and praised as a good lass, regardless of what she does, and that being an accessory to someone's criminal activity and making dupes out of law enforcement people who are trying to do their assigned jobs of bringing criminals to justice is okay. The Town also indicates the continued 'dumbing down' of America and the world; the fact that such a film not only can be mad, but to have such glowing reviews from most people is a strong reflection of that.",1,29,55,29 March 2014
