E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T (Special Edition)
","I quote...In the original release, the government agents pursuing E.T. and Elliot had weapons in their hands; the new edition digitally replaces them with walkie-talkiesElliot's insult to his brother ('penis breath') has been removed.Elliot's mother's prohibition to go trick-or-treating dressed as 'a terrorist' has been changed to 'a hippie'WHY WHY WHY???? This movie along with Jaws, Close Encounters and Indiana Jones to me represents Spielbergs best period as a director, but this goes to prove once and for all that this guy has lost it big time. I am almost beginning to wonder what is going on in his head, and if this is the way things are going I fear for some of the other films I mentioned above.This movie belongs to MY generation, a generation who clearly had more brains and more ability to think for themselves than the current one, do they really need to be 'Protected' from such images as CIA men with guns, or the most harsh of words 'Terrorist'.I hope the film bombs and bombs big, classics are classics for a reason and should never be altered.What's his next project colour in Psycho remove the shower scene, I mean it's a bit violent, we wouldn't want to disturb anyone.Maybe he should call it a day before he makes a complete fool of himself.As for E.T, as I have said before it is a classic from a Director, who at that time, could do no wrong.",Null,0,0,16 March 2002
