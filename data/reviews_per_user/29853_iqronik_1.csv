Skyfall," What a waste of 20$ for VIP seats
","One of few those movies, when you are so bored after the middle that can't resist the urge to leave your VIP seats and just drive home. 1st action sequence is nice! Titles at start - OK, nice soundtrack and some effects saved it. What comes next - pure shitty mess. Don't go, watch it home later. It captures you right with the opening sequence, which is absolutely thrilling and beautifully choreographed, ye, you want to see what happen next and ..... WHAT? This movie lacks decent story, all other things, such as picture and audio quality are pretty good though. $150,000,000 budget? I don't believe it at all. Actors and Supporting Cast took 90% of the pot probably.",2,21,43,8 November 2012
