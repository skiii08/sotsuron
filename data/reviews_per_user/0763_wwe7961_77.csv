Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's like seeing a friend getting beaten to death.
","The original Star Wars trilogy was fantastic. This is a mess. So many things were done so wrong that it seems like Lucas played a sick joke on us. I refuse to call this Star Wars. The film is extremely dull, the visuals aren't even very good, the dialogue doesn't make any sense, there is stereotypes everywhere, the characters are boring, the acting from everyone is terrible, the plot feels like it was made up as they went along, and the force is now a bacteria. It does every last thing wrong. Even the great score isn't enough to redeem this abomination. There is no words to describe how bad it is. I would rather set myself on fire than watch this thing destroy such a great franchise. Lucas has stabbed every Star Wars fan in the back with this.0 stars out of 4",1,8,16,2 August 2010
The Hangover," A hilarious movie that at the same time is an interesting mystery.
","This movie is comedic gold. It is filled with great characters, an awesome setting, a great cast, and a well told story. Usually comedies like this end up being not very good, but 'The Hangover' does things to make the formula funny.1.Acctually likable characters 2.Acctually good actors 3.An actually good script 4.A mystery way of doing the comedy All the great things about the movie are made better by how all this stupid stuff they are doing is unknown to us and to the characters. So we learn along with them all the crazy stuff they did the night before. It seems strange, but having he crazy stuff that happened not being shown to us or remembered by the characters is more funny than us just watching them doing the stupid stuff right in front of our faces. We feel the same kind of surprise that they do, and that gives way more laughs than if we just followed these guys through their night of being drunk. Also I found myself very wrapped up in the mystery itself. Not only was I laughing throughout, but I also really wanted to learn with these guys what the did the night before. You feel like you were with them in that one crazy night, and you want to find out everything that happened too. 'The Hangover' is much more than your average comedy. It manages to breath life into the almost dead genre. This and 'Zombieland' are both excellent comedies from 09 that signal a possible return of good quality hilarity.4 stars out of 4",10,1,2,5 October 2010
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Simply a family sci-fi classic
","This film cannot be denied praise for many reasons. The great acting, great visuals, great dialogue, and a boatload of magic. This movie is classic. It feels like one of those movies that a hundred years from now will still be watched by millions. The ending which probably everyone who is reading this know is one of the greatest endings in cinema history. It takes its time, and moves slowly so you can fully soak in the beauty of it. As for the rest of the film it is filled with wonder. The direction is great throughout. Spielberg really did a good job at making everything feel magical. What really gives this film the magic it has is the score. John Williams does an amazing job. Without his great score the film wouldn't be complete. So overall this movie is the definition of timeless. A film that still today will fill you with amazement.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,30 September 2010
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Just Brilliant!
","This film I've loved for years, and I can't tell you how many times I have watched it. When I was a little kid I watched for the cartoons and the funny jokes. Now I can realize just how great this film is. First off I love classic cartoons. I mean who doesn't. They are entertaining to kids, and adults can't deny that they love them too. Now imagine every and I mean every cartoon character you can think of from the golden age of animation in one film. Don't think it's possible? Think again. This film has everyone, and they even have WB and Disney characters in the same scenes together. It feels like a segregation of cartoon characters stopped and now we see everybody together. There is a hilarious scene with Daffy and Donald, and the two big guys from Disney and WB are in a scene together. It is simply amazing and it is a great feeling that will never truly be recaptured. As for the plot it is much more than just a near 2 hour cartoon short. It is a mystery, a thriller, a romance, as well as a great comedy. You really do get attached to the characters, and you get wrapped up in the mystery. It is a very well written story. Then there is the groundbreaking effects. When I was small I never thought about all the stuff the filmmakers had to do to do some of the stuff that happens in this movie. There is an ocean's worth of creativity involved. If you haven't seen these kinds of things done before you will have your jaw drop. 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is a work of genius. It revolutionized cinema and it is still inspiring to this day.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,14 October 2010
Mulan," Very good, but its flaws keep it from achieving greatness.
","Mulan is very well animated, very well written, and very well done. I want so much to give this a 10, but there is a few flaws that take away so much from it. First is the character Mushu. If they had made this without any Mushu this would have been a 10, but he is there. He takes away a lot of drama from the movie. In 'The Hunchback' there was a comedic gargoyle character that took away a lot of drama, but he didn't take up a lot of screen time. Mushu has a lot of screen time to soak up a very large amount of drama, and he isn't even funny. I really wish they took this a little more seriously. Another flaw is Mulan's man voice that is painfully awkward. Although it isn't in the film as much as Mushu so it isn't very bad. Then there is the romance of Mulan and Shang. With other Disney films the romance is needed for the film. With this film we don't need a romance. This film is supposed to be inspiring girls to be who they want to be not just 'girls', but Mulan ends up falling in love with someone just like every other Disney female. Despite these flaws I really like this movie. It just had so much going for it, and it fell short of what it could have been.3 and a 1/2 stars out of 4",9,0,2,18 August 2010
Citizen Kane," NOT I repeat NOT the best film ever, but a fantastic experience.
","This is not the best film ever. Films like 'The Godfather', 'Casablanca', or 'Gone With the Wind' are much more worthy of the title, but does that mean I don't like it? Of course not! The camera angles are beautifully shot, the story is interesting, the acting is great, and the ending is genius. It did change filmmaking in many ways with the creativity it has. All I'm saying it just doesn't do that as much as many other movies that made it to 'AFI's 100 Greatest Movies'. What about 'Gone With the Wind', and its game changing use of color filmmaking? What about the brilliant portrayal of crime life that 'The Godfather' gave us? What about the amazing cinematography in 'Lawrence of Arabia'? There are so many other great films to pick from when naming the greatest film of all time. Why is this the one? Why is this chosen over all the rest? I don't know, but despite it being overrated in my mind it still is brilliant.4 stars out of 4",10,1,3,19 September 2010
Memento," An extremely interesting way to tell a story
","Memento is a genius piece of film making. Instead of it being told forward it is told backwards. It starts at the end, and ends at the start. More and more of the story is reveled from the story as it goes on. That is one of the most original ways of telling a story ever. Acting is nice also. The dialogue is very good. Throughout time will change. A situation will be happening that you don't totally understand. We get to see different sides of characters unfold that we didn't see because the person we see this movie through forgot. This makes it a mystery to be solved at the beginning. All mystery at the end, and answers at the start. Ingenious! Memento is a smart, original, and very well done film.4 stars out of 4",10,0,3,16 August 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Another fantastic film from Quentin Tarantino
","Fantastic dialogue, great action, great editing, strong tension, and great acting are present in this great film. Tarantino is one of the most talented directors in film today. Every time he makes a film expect it to be good. Inglourious Basterds is a very well made piece of cinema, and is one of the best films of 2009. Tarantino's direction as usual is fantastic. Also as usual when it comes to many of the director's films is great acting. Brad Pitt and others all do a great job. The one who steals the show though is Christoph Waltz. When he reads the dialogue of the film he puts so much tension into the moment. He deserved the Oscar he got for this performance. Inglourious Basterd is another great film from Quentin Tarantino.4 stars out of 4",10,2,11,29 July 2010
Shaun of the Dead," Although it was upstaged by 'Zombieland' a few years later this still is brilliant.
","This movie is a hilarious film. Jokes never fall flat, and characters are all memorable. There is also a hint of drama that gives it a nice edge. Many people may say it starts out slow, but if you aren't entertained by this by the time it is over you aren't human. It is filled to the brim with British humor which I love. I find British humor hilarious. The gore is awesome. The gore, and blood is simply great. The actors also give very good performances. Now there will always be a debate of which is better this or 'Zombieland'. In opinion this 'Zombieland' is a little bit better, but this film is great comedy gold.4 stars out of 4",10,1,4,3 September 2010
Beauty and the Beast," This film truly is a beauty
","Beauty and the Beast is a fantastic film. The animation is beautiful, the emotional power is huge, the writing is great, the characters are memorable, the songs are all classics, and when I say this is one of Disney's best I really do mean that when I think of the best Disney film I think of this a lot. It moves along at a perfect pace. It never moves to fast, and never feels slow. Voice acting all around is really good. Jokes do work really well in the film too. I love 'The Hunchback', but I thoughts its main flaw was that the one comedic gargoyle always took away so much drama in the dramatic moments. In this they have comedic moments that don't take anything at all away from the drama. The jokes also are nice. The Beauty and the Beast is a true masterpiece classic.4 stars out of 4",10,3,4,17 August 2010
Superbad," Hilarious and also in many ways heartwarming.
","This movie is one of the funniest of the 21st century. The jokes are hilarious, and it is spoken by a great cast. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen, and others are excellent in their roles. The characters they play you really latch on to you. They are extremely likable in many ways. The dialogue is also superb. It's a fast moving script that gives many great lines by the end of the movie. Also at the end I sorta felt some happiness. It's one thing to make me laugh throughout, but to make a vulgar comedy like this actually make my heart warm is a very big plus. It's a film about friendship, and that message manages to find its way through all the vulgar stuff.4 stars out of 4",10,57,88,7 October 2010
Ed Wood," Ed Wood is made for anyone who wants to make film
","Ed Wood is by far Tim Burton's greatest achievement. The person Ed Wood was dedicated to film and wanted to entertain people with his films. Despite his love of film his films are excepted as some of the worst of all time. I personally like Ed Wood's films, but that's besides the point. This film shows a filmmaker's want to make movies. Ed Wood despite being told by people that he has no talent works for his dream, and tries his hardest. That is a message for anyone wanting to make films. Try for your dream despite it looking impossible. Not everything in the film is truth. They do make a few lies here and there, but a lot of this movie is real events. In the end Ed Wood is a great biography on an extremely interesting person.4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,2 August 2010
Juno," A touching film
","Juno is an excellent example of filmmaking that I consider to be one the best films of the decade. Everything is done right with movie. The actors all do a good job, the writing is great, the jokes are funny, and the emotional stuff does work. It really is one of those special little movies that comes out of nowhere and surprises you. I also really liked the soundtrack for the film. The ending with where the two characters are singing along with each other is such a great scene made even better by the great song they are singing. Juno is the pure definition of what a sleeper hit is. Nobody knew what it was when it came out, and in the end people were talking about it. This film hits all the right notes.4 stars out of 4",10,2,7,1 September 2010
The Terminator," A fantastic sci-fi thriller
","The Terminator is a thrilling sci-fi that entertains. This is the movie that got started James Camerons clime of fame. The action, suspense, plot, acting, and dialogue is great. The score is great especially the main song. Arnold gives a scary performance as one of my favorite villains The Terminator. Kyle Reese's dialogue when he talks about the future is very well written, and gives you a good impression of how bad it is in the future. The shootout at the police station is great, and shows off how The Terminator is a killing machine. Also I am impressed with how they made the movie with just almost 6 and half million and made it look so good. The Terminator is a great film.4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,2 August 2010
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Absolute perfection! Brilliant from beginning to end.
","When I decided to watch this movie for the first time today I thought that it was going to much like a 'Monty Python' film. I love 'Monty Python', but the movie I am reviewing today is different. 'Monty Python' is funny humor that is filled with a lot of silly satire. With 'Dr. Strangelove' it never seems to take itself really unseriously. Does it at times get unrealistic? Yes, but compared to most comedies this gets very subtle. The dialogue is simply amazing. In fact I think that if I called it that this movie has the best dialogue ever in a film I wouldn't get a lot if any backlash. The characters after seeing them one time I already feel like I have seen them a million times how memorable the characters are. The people who play the characters are just wonderful, and would like to thank them all. It just unbelievable what I got out of this movie. In my opinion it works well as both a comedy and a drama. I love every moment of it.4 stars out of 4",10,1,2,17 October 2010
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Although the weakest in the trilogy it is a great end to the series.
","The first Star Wars was everything anyone could ever ask for. The sequel amazingly was even better. Then there is this film. It is obviously the weakest out of them, but that means pretty much nothing at all. Everything is still done great and the trilogy stands strong. A lot of people complained about the Ewoks, but I didn't mind that. I love all 3 Star Wars films. They all have groundbreaking effects, great acting, great atmosphere, great stories, great music, everything works. They will be known in cinema as one of if not the greatest trilogy in film history. Everyone who made these films I would like to thank for all the effort, and time you put into these great movies.4 stars out of 4",10,0,2,2 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Amazingly worse than 'The Phantom Menace'
","This is terrible. Attack of the Clones doesn't do things that just infuriate Star Wars fans like the first prequel. There is no mention of midichlorians, and Jar-Jar is in it way less. In terms of insulting Star Wars fans this isn't as bad as 'The Phantom Menace'. In terms of which has less quality this one is worse. The dialogue is awful, and most of the actors are terrible. Anakin was extremely annoying in the first prequel, and he is even worse here. He complains all the time throughout the film, he is creepy, and is very unlikeable. The person who plays Anakin gives the worst performance in the film. Hayden Christensen is so bad that I want to punch him in the face. The dialogue he is given is shockingly bad, and he makes it sound even worse. The dialogue for everyone sounds less like Star Wars and more like a soap opera. Scratch that soap operas are way less cheesy. Then there is the worst thing about this thing. The romance between Anakin and Padme is the worst I have ever seen. The actors have no chemistry, the romantic dialogue is awful, Padme doesn't even seem to like Anakin until the script tells her to, Anakin does almost nothing right to make her fall in love with him, Anakin acts like a creepy stalker, it's extremely cliché, and it's the most forced romance ever. I would rather watch Jar-Jar sing in Star Wars on Ice than watch this romance again. It's that bad. There are a few things that are good about the movie. Christopher Lee as Count Dooko is great, and the score is excellent. Actually change that there is only two good things about the movie. The effects are good, but there is barely a scene that doesn't use a green screen or an effect. There is so much CGI that I felt like stabbing my eyes out. It feels so artificial. Even Yoda isn't even good in this movie. Frank Oz who was Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, and the Star Wars film after this just isn't very wise. In Empire and Jedi he was a very wise, and was well acted from Frank Oz. When the prequels came along Yoda lost his wisdom. He stopped being interesting, and well acted by Frank Oz. Samul L Jackson doesn't fit the role he is given at all. The characters Jackson plays in his movies are usually badmouthed and violent. So when he was put in this movie what was he to do. Star Wars is largely geared towards kids so he couldn't start dropping F bombs. So he is given a role that is the exact opposite of what he is usually given. Therefor Jackson isn't given a chance to deliver a performance. It seemed to me that he was more reading his lines than acting. So Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones is a terrible movie. Only two things I can find are actually good, and the rest is horrid.0 stars out of 4",1,1,7,4 August 2010
Forrest Gump," No word can describe it
","There is absolutely nothing to say. Everything in this film is done to absolute perfection. Every shot is beyond beautiful, every actor is beyond fantastic, every second of the score is beyond amazing, every character is beyond wonderful, everything this film gives me is beyond compare. This film is my favorite of all time, and nobody will ever steal its spot. Everyone who was involved with this film has earned more respect out of me than anyone. This is the film that inspired me to want to make, and review film. I have watched many films, but none have ever made an impact on me as Forrest Gump. This movie does everything right. Everything done in this movie is pretty much the best anyone has ever done. Tom Hanks delivers what is in my opinion the best performance in film history as the greatest character in film history. Every word that Forrest says I hold on to. 'Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what your going to get.' If that is the truth than this movie is a box of chocolates too. When I saw this film for the first time I didn't know what I was going to get. What I got is amazing.4 stars out of 4",10,1,2,3 August 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," A very entertaining film that entertains kids and features a lot of great in-jokes that get parents to like it
","Pixar is very unique. They have films that appeal to kids as well as adults, and this film is no different. The characters are memorable, the jokes are great, the premise is original, the animation was great for the time, and the voice acting is fantastic. Most kids films don't get parents to like it, but I have heard many older viewers of this movie say that this is their favorite of the Pixars. With this film there is very little not to like. Many people complain that the Boo character is cliché in its cuteness. I answer that statement with the words 'What now? Is nothing allowed to be cute anymore?'. This movie had effort, and time put into it which is a trademark of Pixar.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,7 September 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Part 1 of the most epic trilogy ever
","A word that can be associated with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is epic. Epic is the word to describe these movies. The first film The Fellowship of the Ring is fantastic. The writing is excellent, the acting is great, the effects were groundbreaking. This gave us a good idea of what we were in for with this series. EPIC, EPIC, EPIC stuff was what we saw in the future 2 films. The characters are all very good, and have already become household names. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, and everyone else in the cast give great performances. The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring was a start of a great friendship between me and the series.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,3 August 2010
Lilo & Stitch," I know I'm a minority on giving this film a 10, but I can't help loving it.
","Lilo and Stitch was great film with extremely likable characters, great animation, strong emotion, and jokes that are hilarious. It really hasn't been appreciated as much as it should be. The film is filled with likable characters such as Stitch, and especially Lilo. Lilo is such a strange, but adorable kid that is one of the most likable characters in animation in the 2000's. The music is great. It features a few songs from Elvis, and it has some great Hawaiian songs. The jokes aren't just chucklers they are jokes that will genuinely make you laugh even if you are an adult. Then there is the strong emotion about family. Lilo and Stitch was a sign of a great decade for Disney animation, but instead of making great movies they decided to rip off little girls with Hannah Montana, The Jonas Brothers, and High School Musical. Lilo and Stitch is a film that is impossible not to love.4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,17 August 2010
The Shining," A strange film that doesn't follow any pure horror movie formula.
","This movie is weird, weird, weird, but it is such a well made masterpiece of horror that is very scary. Jack Nicholson is Oscar worthy as the insane father/husband that goes insane from isolation. You feel the isolation with him also. The film makes you feel the isolation that Jack is going through. The film is really scary. If you do not get creeped out by the two little girls than you are not human. This film doesn't fit many horror sub-genres. Slasher? No. Gorefest? No. Cheesy B movie? No. It really is in a world of its own, and creates something fantastic. This film is one of my favorite horror film ever, and will continue to be amazing.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,26 August 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best films of all time
","Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a perfection. The action and sci-fi elements go together like bread and butter. It also contains some of the greatest action sequences in film history, but that doesn't stop it from having a deep storyline. The characters go through changes, the dialogue is razor sharp, and the acting is wonderful. Arnold gives the best performance in his career. The jokes are often funny. Moments with The Terminator talking to John Conner are just as good at times as the big action sequences. The effects were groundbreaking at the time. The score is fantastic. I think that the score is easily the greatest ever. I could watch this film so many times and still love it. It has no flaws.4 stars out of 4",10,5,6,30 July 2010
Apocalypse Now," Fantastic film that is one of the best war films ever.
","From the same man who created the work of art known as 'The Godfather' comes this fantastic film. The direction, writing, acting, editing, and visuals are all very good. This is often called the best war film ever. I'll just say that is very high up there. The cinematography for the time was simply gorgeous. I think this is best shown at the end where the characters are surrounded by shadows, and there is light shining on their faces. It gets really good in those scenes. The characters aren't the most memorable war movie characters, but I can completely forgive that for the pure artistry going on with this film. Acting from this film is very good. The brutality it shows is very strong. This film is one of the best war films of all time.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,26 August 2010
The Exorcist," Watch it at midnight with the lights off and enjoy.
","This movie is beyond creepy. It has a sense of atmosphere thicker than pea soup. It is filled with moments that will make you go 'Yikes!'. The acting from the whole cast is solid. The performance that really impressed me was Linda Blair. She gives one of the finest child performances. When she is supposed to be innocent she can be compared to bunnies even. When she has to go crazy god damn does she go crazy. The cinematography is excellent capturing the dark atmosphere perfectly. Therec is also some of the finest uses of make up ever when Regan gets fully possessed. Many people call this the scariest movie ever. I wouldn't say the scariest, but would be lying if I said this wasn't one of the creepiest and most shocking ever.4 stars out of 4",10,1,2,15 October 2010
Spirited Away," An amazing experience
","Very, very, very well done. This is the best anime film I have ever seen. I'm not totally insane over anime. I don't own every Naruto and Dragon Ball Z episode on DVD. I do appreciate the detail put into animation, but I'm not like an anime nerd. This film makes me want to watch more anime. It's so good it will make you into a nerd. The animation, imagination, and magic of this film just amazes me. Everything feels filled with magic. Every last moment fills me with wonder. Spirited Away is just fantastic. I doubt I'll ever find anime better than this masterpiece. I hope that the maker of this will keep on making these movies for a long time.4 stars out of 4",10,1,2,3 August 2010
Gone with the Wind," Cinematic gold
","This movie is excellent. The film for the time amazed people. This is truly an epic movie. Also it is very well written. I love the idea of the the civil war being seen through the eyes of someone on the confederate side. that way we see how the war was awful for everyone. The dialogue is great, and it is spoken by a fantastic cast. In fact the cast all together give one of the greatest performances in film history. Only watch it if you have a lot of time on your hands. This is not one of those movies you can just sit down, watch, and enjoy. It has a run time of 4 hours. Gone with the Wind is an epic, strong, well acted film that is amongst the best.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,2 August 2010
No Country for Old Men," A thriller that thrills more than any other
","There is so many good things to say about this film. The acting is great, the dialogue is fantastic, the cinematography is beautiful, but the thing that takes this film to a whole new level is the suspense. Every second of suspense I wish was hours. When a bullet is shot you feel it. You feel like your in the shoes of the guy getting shot at. Everything is just so well done. You'll need time to breath after watching it because you don't want to take one breath while suspense is building. A lot of people complained about the ending I didn't mind it. Overall No Country for Old Men is a great piece of cinema that will get your heart racing.4 stars out of 4",10,3,4,2 August 2010
District 9," Dark, gritty, and fantastic
","This film is great. Sci-fi in 2000's was not strong, but this gives the genre some life. It is a very dark, realistic film. It doesn't hold punches, and it isn't family friendly. The visuals are great, and were actually made with just 30 million dollars. The dialogue feels very real. The action is awesome, and the gore is really cool. The acting is very good despite many actors being newcomers. It is such a dark fantastic movie that really pulls you in. At times it is very hard to watch how brutal it gets, but that's a sign that the movie is working. Overall this movie is brutal, dark, gritty, and very very very good at what it's doing.4 stars out of 4",10,0,7,2 August 2010
Twilight," Bland-something boring and uninteresting Ex. Twilight
","Bland is the perfect word to use with everything about Twilight. Bland acting, bland story, bland dialogue, bland direction, bland cinematography, bland romance, bland effects, bland action, everything is bland about Twilight. It is one of those movies you watch to make fun of, but after watching you feel like you really wasted two hours. It's unlike other bad movies were you can watch, review, and feel entertained by making fun of it. With Twilight everything is so boring that you feel like falling asleep ten minutes in. I found myself so bored that I started thinking about stuff for around thirty seconds. When stopped thinking about stuff I looked back at my TV to see the movie playing. It is so bland that thirty seconds of though made me forget that it was playing. That is like a cup of water and a stale piece of bread blandness. Sure there is other things to complain about also. The effects are terrible. When Edward runs it looks like he's going up an escalator in the ground. Then there is the moronic romance. Bella staying in love with a guy that stalks her, wants to kill her, and watches her sleep for months is pretty stupid. The ending where Edward sucks the venom out of Belle to stop her from becoming a vampire is stupid. If he let her change she would be safe from vampires, and he wouldn't have to deal with her growing old and dying. Sure she would have to live with seeing her loved ones die, but she would have Edward with her. Also her parents are grow old and die anyway so what's all the difference that she doesn't age during that time. Then of course there is sparkling vampire skin. It is really the stupidest thing ever. How is he supposed to pass as a strong vampire if he has sparkle skin. Why not make it be when he is in the light his true evil form is revealed or something like that? Oh yeah because A.That would be cool B.That would create actual dramatic tension C.Girls like jewelry so they love guys with sparkle skin. I'm not trying to be sexist here it's just these girls who buy this crap are increasing the stereotype of moronic teenage girls that have awful taste. I don't want to be sexist with this statement, but if this is a phenomenon to girls than it is official that a large portion of teenage girls have no taste whatsoever. In the end though it is the blandness that sticks out with this one. A pile of trash in many occasions can be better than nothing. Twilight sure is a nothing.0 stars out of 4",1,6,7,2 December 2010
Saving Private Ryan," The best war movie I have ever seen
","Man was this good movie. I can't believe I haven't seen by now, but now I have. I love this movie. The realism makes you feel like your with them in the battle, the conversations they have feel real, and the emotional strength it has is huge. My favorite movie from Steven Spielberg used to be Jaws, but this has defeated it. As for Tom Hanks movies this is so far my second favorite. My favorite will always be Gump, but this is still a great film. The first 24 minutes is in real time. These minutes are one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen. People die left and right. People have their guts hanging out, arms and legs are blown off, it really is a powerful scene filled with realism. Acting performances are all great, but the best as expected is from Tom Hanks. Overall this film is piece of genius.4 stars out of 4",10,1,2,13 August 2010
Lawrence of Arabia," Simply put this film is one of the best films ever.
","There are so many adjectives to describe to this film. Epic, amazing, gorgeous, powerful, brilliant, action-packed, emotional, beautiful. This film goes almost beyond a description. For anyone like me who was scared by the film's length of almost four hours let me tell you that this film never gets dull, and always will amaze you. The acting is superb. Everyone in the cast even the soldiers do a great job. There is moments throughout the film where you will wonder how they did something so perfectly. This films name has also been attached to the word epic. Everything in this film is huge. The battles, the desert, everything. The writing is fantastic, and is amazingly based of real events. This film is one of highest achievements in film history. This is amazing.4 stars out of 4",10,0,3,26 August 2010
The Little Mermaid," The film that returned Disney back to power is a fantastic example of how to make a great animated film.
","The Little Mermaid is without a doubt a classic. The animation is wonderful, the characters are likable, the music is some of Disney's best, and you feel the romance very well. Things like the animation of Ariel's hair floating in the water must have amazed audiences when it first came out. It doesn't have as many likable characters as some other Disney movies, but the ones that are likable are very likable. The music is fantastic. 'Under the Sea' is one of Disney's best, and most famous songs. It is just so catchy. Then there are a few other great songs. Ursula's song 'Poor Unfortunate Souls' is really cool. Then there is 'Kiss the Girl' which I think may be just as good as 'Under the Sea'. The romance is very well done, and you feel a lot of happiness from it. I'm a guy, and I'm willing to admit that I think this film is fantastic.4 stars out of 4",10,2,2,18 August 2010
Good Will Hunting," Cast, script, direction, and emotion is all A+ stuff
","This movie is very special. It features very surprising acting, a great script, and much more. Everyone in the cast does an good job, but the two that stand out are Matt Damon and Robin Williams. They are both phenomenal. Matt does a great job in his role as a punk who doesn't know how to escape his punk lifestyle (also doesn't even know if he wants to) despite being a genius. He plays being a genius very well. When he is given the big scientific words to say very quickly he does it like a real genius would. Then there is Robin Williams giving a wonderful performance. With most of the movies you have probably seen him in sucking you'll be surprised by how much of a good job he does here. Then there is the very good script to back this movie up. Ben and Matt will surprise you with how good their writing is. Also if you know Affleck for his work in stuff like 'Gigli' trust me when I say that he can be a great writer and actor if he gets it right. Also the camera-work here is excellent. Overall this movie I highly recommend for it's strong story and cast.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,21 September 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Part 2 of the most epic trilogy of all time
","After the fantastic Fellowship of the Ring we wait a year to finally get Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Just like the first this film is just fantastic. The acting is still great, the writing is still great, the characters are still great, and it is even more epic. It is just great. Many people consider this to be the weakest of the 3 films, but I think that this stands with the first in excellence. In this film we are introduced to Gollum. Gollum is the thing that most people remember about this film. His visuals are fantastic, and the character's split personality is commonly parodied. This great film continues the trilogy, and sets us up for the great end of The Lord of the Rings.4 stars out of 4",10,0,2,3 August 2010
The Hurt Locker," Beautifully shot, extremely well acted, and very powerful.
","At the time I am posting this review America is in the middle of a war in Iraq. Despite it being a very large subject there have not been many war movies about Iraq. Now a film has stepped up to the plate to hit a homerun. This movie deserves to have its name attached to classic war films such as 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Apocalypse Now'. Years into the future I imagine that this will be excepted as a classic. First off the cinematography is gorgeous. My favorite scene is when they go to an area where a bomb went off. The cinematography is simply breathtaking in those moments. Then we have some very well written dialogue. You'll also find yourself laughing every once in a while too. Then there is some great characters. Character development is very strong here. You really like these characters, and you don't want to see them get hurt. The best thing about the movie though is the powerful emotion of how war can be addicting. That is what makes this film so great. So overall I highly recommend this experience.4 stars out of 4",10,2,5,25 September 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A powerful film about friendship, family, humanity, as well as the Holocaust.
","The film starts out small, but slowly grows larger. As it goes on the film gets more powerful. It has a strong cast, great direction, and a constant strength. It not only covers the Holocaust, but it also covers many other things also. There is the friendship that the two boys have. Despite the Zazi system telling them they are supposed to be enemies they form a strong bond. The German boy Bruno sees kindness in the Jewish boy's heart despite him being in a family that is in the Nazi party. The Jewish boy Shmuel sees that Bruno is not like the Nazis who put himself in the camp. He sees kindness in him just like Bruno did with Shmuel. Also it talks about what family means. Bruno's family as I said is Nazi. His father is part of Hitler's army, and his sister has posters all over her walls showing support for the Nazis. Despite this we see that he still loves his family. We see that he doesn't know what side to be on. Should he follow his heart, or should he follow his people. On one side he has this friend he met that he believes is not evil like what his people tell him he is. On the other he has the family he loves that he couldn't imagine would be part of a cruel treatment of an innocent people. We feel his emotions, and we are there with him all the way through his hard decisions on what is right. Then we have how the film shows humanity even in someone as cruel as a Nazi officer. I would explain this, but that would spoil the ending. As for the ending you don't see endings this powerful often. There is also terrific acting. Nobody in the cast doesn't deliver a well put together performance. Overall this is in my opinion a fantastic film.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,29 September 2010
The Dark Knight," A big budget summer action flick that is very smart.
","Most big summer movies are stupid. Films like Tranformers 2 are stupid, and don't have effort put into them yet they make millions of dollars. The Dark Knight could have easily have been a stupid big budget movie, but it wasn't. It was taken seriously. No dogs humping, no robot testicles, no parents getting high, no racist stereotypes, no Megan Fox showing off her body, it doesn't do things many big summer movies do. It is a serious crime drama about a mad man who wants to spread chaos throughout Gotham, and one man must do things many others don't agree with to stop him. The characters, plot twists, action scenes, dialogue, cinematography, and acting are all fantastic. Heath Ledger's performance was amazing. He took all the previous jokers, other famous villains, and a little of his own idea for the character to make the greatest villain in film history. His performance was one of the best I have ever experienced. This film brings hope to my heart that summer action films can be smart. This is one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure to watch.4 stars out of 4",10,0,3,1 August 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Wow
","I am speechless. I don't know what to say. This is amazing. This a film that takes your brain, chops it into little tiny pieces, puts it back together perfectly, and puts back in your head at the end of the movie. It is so strange that I love it so much. By the end of the movie I felt like I was a different person. I was still exactly the same, but something felt different. It moves slowly, but that lets you feel every moment of it. The use of sound in the film is the best I have ever heard. The music and sound editing is just amazing. The visuals for the time sent sci-fi in a new kind of direction. Hal-9000 is one of the greatest villains ever. I could go on for days. This film is amazing.4 stars out of 4",10,12,24,2 August 2010
Toy Story," A charming classic of my childhood.
","I remember always watching this film when I was little. I would put it in my VHS player, sit down, and enjoy. It brings me a lot of joy to watch this film. No matter how old you are this is important to all our childhoods. We all played with toys when we were young. Our Batmans, our Teenage Muntant Ninga Turtles, our slinkies, our hula hoops, and many more. If your reading this and your under the age of dead you know this is true. This is a film we can all except no matter what age we are. It is something timeless. The voice actors are great, the animation was amazing, the dialogue is hilarious, and the characters are all memorable. It is a big part of me and everyone.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,2 August 2010
The Graduate," A film that has an amazing feel to it.
","Throughout the film you get that feel of that everything has gone horribly wrong. The feeling of putting your face in your pillow and closing your eyes to try and find peace, but once you leave that pillow you still have those problems. This film is just fantastic. I love the music, the dialogue, but as I said it is that feel that makes this so good. Many films have tried to capture the films feel. Some have failed, and some have done a good job. In the end though there is only one Graduate. That delicious bitter-sweet taste in your mouth from this movie just can't be matched. The Graduate is fantastic movie that you feel so much you could watch it with your eyes closed.4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,2 August 2010
Avatar," The most overrated film in history
","The plot is stolen from many different movies, there was only 3 good actors, the characters are either bland or stereotypical, and yet it made almost 3 billion. When I think a film is overrated I usually like it. I don't think of it as Oscar worthy, but I like it. Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history, but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie. It didn't have any effort put into the story at all. Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic, but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas. It is an awful movie, but people and critics liked it. Why is that? Well that is due to the effects. Few watching, or reviewing cared about what the story was. All they cared about was the effects. Yes the effects and 3-D are great, but without the substance of a well written story it fails. I don't care if the effects are the best ever. Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer, and staring at the screensaver. You think it looks cool so you look at it. Next time you look up it is 3 hours later. Would consider that a good way to spend your time. No you would not, but you think that Avatar is worth your time. This a movie that is destroying filmmaking.1 star out of 4",1,64,110,2 August 2010
Toy Story 2," Improves on original
","I love the first film and it was very important to my childhood, but this was even bigger to me. Everything is done better. The jokes are even funnier, the drama is more dramatic, the animation is better, the voice actors do an even better job in this. Every last thing is improved. The world we see is larger than the one in the first movie therefor it has a more universal feel that there is more than just Andy's house. The fun I have with this film is beyond numbers. This is one of the best examples of how to make a wonderful sequel. Toy Story was a fantastic film, but this is an improvement that makes the original even better how good it is.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,2 August 2010
Up," A fantastic family film experience
","There is nothing not to love about this movie. It is just so good. There is a scene in this film that is so powerful, and didn't even have any dialogue. The jokes are very funny. You'll be smiling when the credits are rolling. The score is so good. It is one of the best scores I have heard in a while. It adds so much emotion to the moment and makes the film even better. The animation is very good. The voice actors are fantastic. Everyone in the film delivers a great performance. Up is just a beautifully made film that would warm the heart of a snowman. This is one of Pixar's finest films and I had a great time watching it. Up is great.4 stars out of 4",10,1,3,2 August 2010
Rocky," The underdog story
","This is a fantastic film with heart. The story of Rocky is an underdog story of a man who wants to go all the rounds with the current champ. He doesn't care if he loses all he wants to prove is that he isn't just some smalltime bum. The music, cinematography, acting, and writing are all four equal pieces of the Rocky puzzle. The writing itself is great, but the wonderful acting makes it even better. Then the amazing cinematography adds even more to it. Then the fantastic music just takes this film to the top. It is a strong film that is by far Sly's best. Rocky has become an icon. He stands as a hero who followed the want to prove himself. This is one of the best.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,2 August 2010
Pulp Fiction," An amazingly entertaining movie.
","This film is throughout an extremely entertaining, funny, and very well written. The dialogue in this movie is easily the best ever. Scenes of two people talking in this movie are better than any action scene they could have thrown at us with this movie. The characters are all extremely memorable. This film in my opinion without a doubt qualifies as one of the best films ever made, and definitely one of the most entertaining also. Acting from everyone is great, but you can't beat Jackson's 'And you'll know my name is the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thy.'. This film is an entertaining film that is sure to please those who want to watch it, and many of those who don't.4 stars out of 4",10,2,5,26 August 2010
Zombieland," Hilarious and extremely entertaining
","Zombieland is pretty much a documentary on how to make a great comedy. The characters are very likable, the jokes are funny, the action is cool, the gore is great, and everything works. While being very funny it is also deep. The characters form a bond and become a family. The apocalypse is looked at positively and negatively. They enjoy killing zombies and breaking things, but they also miss what they lost. When people are walking through destroyed areas filled with empty cars it looks great. Dialogue between people in this movie is fantastic. Seeing people talk about killing zombies is so entertaining. I love this movie. I can't wait for the sequel.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,2 August 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," A powerful piece of cinema that shows how our lives are more important than we think they are.
","This is a wonderful movie. It goes beyond the typical holiday special, and gives us something to think about. Rather than giving us that jolly feeling of Christmas through something visual or emotional this film gives it to us in more of a mental way. It makes us think about how important our lives really are, and that we should be glad to be alive. It makes us think about how we have changed the lives of people though we wouldn't realize it. It gives the mind a message that is received the brain and stays there. Yes it does give a heartwarming feel that I love, but I feel the main focus of the story was lesson it wanted to teach its watchers. They deliver that message stronger than any other film I have ever seen. You learn from this movie. This is really one of the best I have ever seen. The cast delivers wonderfully, the script is strong, the cinematography is excellent, and as I said the message it gives is genuine. I love this movie.4 stars out of 4",10,1,4,11 December 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Stupid and not fun
","Transformers 2 is one the biggest failures I have ever experienced. The characters are uninteresting, the dialogue sounds like it was written by a 5 year old, the actors don't try, the humor is painfully juvenile and unfunny, and the the film is filled with so much CGI my eyes started to bleed. Yet despite this film failing in every way possible it still became a huge success at the box office. Micheal Bay is one of the worst directors ever. His action scenes are always are too shaky, and the writing in his films are so bad it barely counts as writing. He doesn't have any care about what he is doing at all. I hate this movie. It is Micheal Bays crowning achievement in awful. It is a dull, unfunny, and idiotic piece of garbage.1/2 of a star out of 4",1,2,10,1 August 2010
A Hard Day's Night," A hilarious comedy, great musical, and wonderful biography.
","This movie is is one the most likable films I have ever seen. First off I LOVE The Beatles. They are the greatest band in music history. They had great vocals, they made a large impact on music videos as well as music, and they are hilarious. This movie is the funniest thing I have ever seen. I cracked up about a million times. As for acting The Beatles prove they are more than just singers. They all are charismatic in their roles as themselves. They take the already hilarious jokes and make them gutbusters. As for music do I really need to say about how the music is awesome. It's The Beatles of course the music is great! The dialogue is also very well written. Then we have the characters. Of course we have The Beatles playing The Beatles, and they are as I said hilarious. Then there other characters that I also think are hilarious also. The grandfather is just as much of a gutbuster as The Beatles. Overall if you are The Beatles fan watch this movie as soon as possible. If you aren't still enjoy this movie. It may not make you go crazy for The Beatles, but you'll enjoy yourself the whole time.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,19 September 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A strong film that highly impressed me. One of the best films I have ever seen.
","This movie is a fantastic prison escape movie that is less about escaping, and more about prison. The actors all give some of the greatest performances I have ever seen. Jack Nicholson steals the show though. The relationships between the characters feel so real. The emotion is very powerful. At the end I was holding back some tears. It also is a very funny movie. I laughed many times. The characters are all so memorable. My favorite of course is Jack's character. The direction, and editing are also good stuff. When the score is playing it is very good. This film has everything I could ask for in a movie. It is an amazing film that is one of the very best.4 stars out of 4",10,0,2,26 August 2010
Jaws," One of my favorites
","Jaws is one of the best. The acting is great, the suspense is great, it takes its time, and moves slowly in a good way. This started big box office films, and almost none have matched it. Big films nowadays move way to fast. You don't ever get to take in the moment. With Jaws you always get to take in the moment. Everything moves at a good pace. The characters are all very good. The dialogue is great. A lot of people complain that the shark looks fake. I think it looks way more real than if it was CGI. It is also very scary. After this film nobody would go in the water. Jaws is an iconic piece of film that I love and will always love.4 stars out of 4",10,9,16,2 August 2010
The Wrestler," The 'Rocky' of wrestling
","Is it as good as Rocky? No it isn't. Although just like Rocky this film is fantastic. The cinematography is great, the acting is wonderful, and the dialogue is very good. The emotion in this film is some of the strongest stuff of the 2000's. The sets are very believable. Unlike Rocky it doesn't have a big score, but that does make it feel like your watching a real former wrestler's life. Mickey Rourke deserved an Oscar for his performance. Sean Penn did a good job in Milk, but Rourke deserved it way more. The biggest complaint that people have with the film is that it copies Rocky. I do agree that it is very similar to the Rocky films, but this movie despite that is just great.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,2 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," All I have to say is YES!!!!
","The original Star Wars trilogy revolutionized cinema, and is one of the best trilogies ever. Years later George Lucas created the abomination of a prequel 'The Phantom Menace'. Everything was done wrong in the film, and many Star wars fans like myself felt insulted. Then there was 'Attack of the Clones' which was amazingly worse than the first prequel. After Lucas failed miserably with the first two Star Wars prequels we got this. This is what the other two films should have been. The writing is much stronger, the acting is way better, and the emotion is more powerful. How George managed to improve so much from such bad movies as the first two prequels amazes me. I wish that this kind of effort was put into the first two. Yes it does still have some terrible romantic dialogue, but it is in the movie way less than 'Attack of the Clones' making it durable. The action feels like it has actual strength behind it from the film's writing. The dialogue is improved upon a lot. Acting is better from flat out everyone in the cast. Even Hayden Christensen has improved a lot. He doesn't deliver a great performance, but you can tell he took a few more acting classes. Then there is the powerful emotion in the film. This is the darkest in the Star Wars franchise. The atmosphere is very strong, and I actually do sorta care about the characters. Unlike the first two prequels. There is so many improvements, but the best by far is how entertaining it is. This film manages to capture the same kind of entertainment we got out of the original trilogy. It's a very entertaining film. It isn't as good as any of the original trilogy, but it is good enough to earn the name Star Wars.3 and a 1/2 stars out of 4Also Jar-Jar is only in it for 4 seconds, and doesn't say anything.

These are some of the best songs I have ever heard. I mean wow are they good. The voice acting is fantastic. Everything about this film is just so entertaining. The animation is beautiful to look at. The characters are likable. The jokes can be funny. The sadness level is through the roof. I cried, and this film is so good I'm willing to admit it. Seriously this film is one of the saddest things I have ever watched. The Lion King succeeds in every way possible. I love this movie.4 stars out of 4",10,1,2,2 August 2010
Inception," While not as good as Dark Knight the film still delivers.
","Christopher Nolan has given us a smart film that is appealing to the eyes as well as the brain. The visuals are used in a way that makes things feel like an amazing dream. The story is interesting, and the actors all do a great job. Leonardo Dicaprio as usual is fantastic. Others like Micheal Kane and Ellen Page also are great. The film is much like The Matrix, but I find Inception to be even better then it. Many have complained that it was too complicated. Many will need to watch it another time to get it, but I understood it well. Does Inception need a sequel? I don't think so. I say it should be left alone as a classic. Is it as good as The Dark Knight? No, but does it have to be.4 stars out of 4",10,2,6,28 July 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," A gritty look at prison. One of the best prison movies ever.
","This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.4 stars out of 4",10,3,4,5 October 2010
Back to the Future Part II," It can't beat the original, but it is one of the best sequels ever
","In 1985 a film called Back to the Future came to theaters. It was a fantastic movie that combined many different genres together to make one fantastic piece of 80's cinema. The sequel doesn't completely match the charm of the original, but it's still a very charming film. A lot of the charm that the original had more of is made up for by the fact that the movie goes back to the events of the first film. This makes us see the film we watched in 1985 in different points of view. The future world they create is also very interesting, and had very strong visuals for the time. One of my favorite scenes is when Marty goes into Cafe 80's, and elements of the 80's like Nintendo, Micheal Jackson, and Ronald Regan are everywhere. Back to the Future 2 isn't as good as the original, but is an excellent example of how to make a sequel.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,6 August 2010
The Emperor's New Groove," Not even close to being a Disney classic, but it is still very enjoyable.
","This a nice little film for a family to pull out a a rainy day. It isn't something that will be called an animated classic years from now like 'The Lion King', but it is entertaining for a whole family. Jokes are all very nice. You'll be chuckling throughout, and you'll blasting out a laugh every once in a while. Characters are very good in the film. Little kids will most likely be doing impersonations of Kronk a lot. The animation is nice also. When it starts out raining it looks pretty good. There is not really any strong emotion to be found in this movie. It is what it is, and what it is is a very enjoyable film that will entertain a family.3 stars out of 4",8,1,2,18 August 2010
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3 is a blast of my young childhood memories.
","Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece and deserves Best Picture or at the least a nomination. When I was small I had a bunch of VHS tapes that I watched all the time. Two films I watched that give me so many good memories were Toy Story and Toy Story 2. When I wasn't watching movies I was playing with toys. Toy Story like toys was a big part of my childhood. Now they are back. All the voice actors (Minus Jim Varney RIP) are back and do a wonderful job. The best performances coming from the great Tom Hanks as Woody, and Ned Beatty as Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear. The old characters are great and so are the new ones. There should not be a sequel. I'm OK with shorts, but as for film it should be left alone. The feeling I got from it was like opening an old toy chest and looking inside and thinking of all the good times I had. It is an epic, sad, funny picture that makes this trilogy the best of all time.4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,28 July 2010
The Deer Hunter," Very powerful
","The Deer Hunter is a fantastic, and emotionally powerful film. Writing, editing, cinematography, and acting are all excellent. The film is very long at 3 hours 3 minutes, but it doesn't ever feel long. This film also has one of the strongest casts I have ever watched. In most movies that have great acting it only is acted fantastic by a few people, and well by others. With this everyone delivers a fantastic performance, and nobody feels overpowered. The best two performances though out of many great ones are from Christopher Walken, and Robert De Niro. This is Walken's best performance, and De Niro delivers powerfully. The Deer Hunter is very strong, and sometimes hard to watch from how powerful the moment is. It really is amazing.4 stars out of 4",10,1,3,16 August 2010
The Sixth Sense," A fantastic ghost story.
","This film is an extremely interesting story glued together by great acting, and directing. This isn't a hardcore R rated slasher. It is a ghost story that doesn't rely on gore or cursing a lot to tell a story. It really is the spiritual successor to 'Poltergeist'. The suspense is powerful. When scares come they are very scary. Acting is great. The most credit in acting should go Haley Joel Osment who knocks it out of the park, and gives one of the best child acting performances ever. M. Night does a great job putting this thing together. Too bad he went from this to 'The Happening'. The story is one of coolest ghost stories ever told. This is a very good plot. This film is everything anyone could ever ask for from a ghost story.4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,19 August 2010

","I was looking forward to a great film, and what I got was a great film. The cinematography is great, the dialogue is great, and it has the same good old Hitchcock suspense we know and love. The actors all do a great job. James Sterwart has the best performance in the film. Seeing all the people's lives happening is very entertaining. All these side stories are just fun to watch unfold. Then there is the main storyline murder mystery. The suspense is very good in the mystery, and I really want them to catch the murderer while watching the movie. It is a work of art from a master of film. I thought Rear Window was a well made masterpiece.4 stars out of 4",10,1,3,3 August 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Part 3 of the most epic trilogy of all time.
","Now here we are with the big one. The film that is often called the best film of the decade. The gigantic mass of epic known as The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Everyone looks at this film as the best. In fact not only the best but the best by far is what people consider this film to be. It was nominated for 11 Oscars including best picture, and won every Oscar it was nominated for. It was a huge success, and yes this film is fantastic. It is one of the biggest adventures I have ever seen. Everything that was great in the first two are great here also. The writing, visuals, acting are all top notch stuff. So is it the best in the trilogy? Well I consider all 3 to stand together as one huge film experience. If any one of them didn't exist the others wouldn't be as good. All of them standing together give us a complete, and epic adventure.4 stars out of 4",10,1,2,3 August 2010
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The best in the slasher genre
","This is a very good film. The kills are few, but are very memorable. Sets are also really nice. The lighting in the boiler room is just perfect. The acting is great for a slasher movie. Most of the time slasher movies have either OK or bad actors, but this movie has some good performances. The premise was genius. In all other horror movies the killer will have to either chase someone down or surprise them to kill them. That is not the case with this movie. Here the killer attacks in your dreams where you are most vulnerable. You'll run away, but he can just appearer right in front of you, and kill you. This makes the odds stacked way against the protagonist, and strikes fear into the people watching that they will be slaughtered in their sleep. The score is chilling. It is one of the best horror movie scores ever. The atmosphere created by the music, the sets, and the effects is really good. Then there is the best thing about it. Freddy Krueger is the best horror villain ever. The way he moves, that evil voice, the great kills, the funny lines just make him such a great villain. He is such a likable villain. You care about the characters, but you can't help loving this guy. Robert Englund you are the man. Overall A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic in horror history.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,15 August 2010

The effects were amazing, the score was amazing, the acting was great, it was a huge adventure that has and will always have millions and millions of fans. The story sucked you in, and the characters were so good you felt like you were with them on the adventure. It takes elements from many different films and makes them feel fresh. Avatar stole from other films and was lazy. Star Wars was actually inspired by the film elements they used. This film really is a timeless classic that will continue to be a timeless classic till the end of time. An important part in the history of film.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,2 August 2010
Tarzan," If Disney's an amusement park of films this is the roller-coaster.
","This is not one of the best from Disney, but it is the biggest animated thrill ride they have ever made. Action sequences for the time were insanely good. Although it isn't just great action sequences that make it good. The music is fantastic. The songs were written, produced, and sung by Phil Collins who does an amazing job. 'Two Worlds' and the other songs are really good. The characters just like any Disney movie are great. Voice acting is good from the cast. The animation still hasn't truly been beaten by Disney in my opinion even after all these years. Tarzan is very good. It is thrill ride with a lot of strength from good writing.3 and a 1/2 out of 4",9,1,1,18 August 2010
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," An example of why British humor is much smarter than ours.
","This is how to make a comedy. Laughs can be found throughout, and the 4th wall falls apart throughout the film without any actors chewing the scenery. The movie from the first scene, and on is great. The acting is wonderful. Everybody in the cast delivers the jokes hilariously. Also the the actors never seem to overact at all. There are a few jokes that go on for to long, but it is aware of this. If only another comedy that doesn't deserve to have its name mentioned (cough Disaster Movie cough) was self-aware that the jokes it had were to long. It really is a shame that British people can say that they have awesome comedies like this, and we have a lot of awful comedies like (sigh) Disaster Movie. This film is a work of genius.4 stars out of 4",10,28,39,3 September 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best in the series
","The first Star Wars changed film forever, and the second did it it even more. The effects are better, the writing is stronger, the acting is better, the atmosphere is better. Every last thing is just done better. Unfortunately it didn't get the same recognition from the Academy as the first. The film only got two wins (for effects and score) and a few nominations. That is sad that it didn't get the same kind of recognition as the first. I love this movie. I love it from start to finish. It is for sure the best in the series, and without a doubt a cinematic piece of gold. I love the first, but this one just takes the cake.4 stars out of 4",10,0,1,2 August 2010
Aladdin," Aladdin may not be as powerful as 'The Beauty and the Beast' or 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame', but is one hell of an entertaining time from Disney.
","Disney doesn't really pull your heart strings with this, but it is without a doubt an extremely entertaining film. The songs are very well done. Of course we all know that 'A Whole New World' is a fantastic song that really gets stuck in your head. The animation on characters isn't as good as it was in 'The Beauty and the Beast', but it makes up for that with extremely epic moments like when they are trying to escape The Cave of Wonders. Characters aren't the greatest Disney has done. That is except for Genie. Robin Williams delivers a funny, energetic, and extremely entertaining performance. You can ask anyone on the planet what their favorite part of Aladdin is, and they will all answer Robin Williams. The Genie in my opinion is definitely one of the great Disney characters. The romance (just like the animation) is not as good as it was in 'The Beauty and the Beast'. Still the romance is filled with all the good old mushy stuff that little kids always turn their head at. In the end Aladdin isn't one of Disney's finest achievements, but it is one great time that I enjoy having.4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,17 August 2010
Donnie Darko," A very under-appreciated masterpiece.
","This movie is brilliant. It doesn't deserve to be called a cult classic because it is so much more than that. I looked at the premise of the film and laughed. A giant bunny? Then today I watched it, and realized that despite it sounding silly it is in no way silly. The best scenes in my opinion are when the bunny is around. His voice send shivers down my spine. It has a lot of powerful buildup to a genius ending. Also I would like to point out the movie has a great soundtrack. It has strange images and camera angles, but at the same time it keeps a brilliant storyline. It is brilliantly directed and written. 'Donnie Darko' is one of the best films to come out in the 2000's.",10,0,1,22 October 2010
The Social Network," One of those rare movies that is perfect.
","This movie is simply amazing. Everything about it just amazes me. The dialogue is fantastic, the acting is wonderful, and the direction is perfect. First thing I really want to talk about when it comes to this masterpiece is the acting. Everyone and I mean EVERYONE is excellent. The performance that surprised the most was Jesse Eisenberg. I loved him in Zombieland and Adventureland, but here he will amaze you. With his roles in Zombieland and Adventureland he was hilarious, but here he shows more range then you thought an actor could ever have. He goes from two funny roles to an amazing dramatic role. Now I know that many people who have not seen the movie will call me crazy, but I think that Jesse Eisenberg deserves the Oscar for Best Actor. I also will go farther by saying that his performance is one of the finest I have ever seen in a film. Andrew Garfield is also fantastic in his role as Eduardo Saverin. Justin Timberlake is one to mention also. Justin should stop singing, and stay in the movies because he is excellent in this movie as Sean Parker. One last person I would like to mention is Brenda Song. Many of you may know her as London Tipton in 'The Suite Life of Zack and Cody'. At that point you probably doubt that she will impress you, but you would be wrong. In her role as Christy Lee she shows how she is more than just some actor from a stupid Disney show. In her role she is very good, and I hope that she looks for more roles like this. Then there is the excellent dialogue. The lines are fast, witty, and full charisma. It shows what these characters are like just through their mannerisms. We also have the excellent direction from David Fincher. This movie is just so well put together throughout. Not one camera angle doesn't work. This film has become my new favorite film of 2010 and I hope that this wins a lot of Oscars. It is masterful.4 stars out of 4",10,3,7,3 October 2010
Back to the Future," A comedy, high school movie, sci-fi, and action movie in one masterpiece
","Back to the Future isn't just a fantastic sci-fi. It is also a funny comedy, a high school movie, and an action movie. This film takes all these genres, puts them together, and makes a classic. There is so many famous lines in the movie that everyone can have their own favorites. There isn't one joke that falls flat, and there is multiple side stories to it. There is the main story of Marty trying to get back to 1985, the story of him trying to get his parents together, the story of Biff Tannen the bully, and many more. All these side-stories are either predictions in 1955 of what 1985 will have, or they add tension. Marty has to take care of all these problems before he can go back to 1985. Due to the fact that he only has a certain amount of time to do these things tension builds in the climax. It is a great movie, and one of the best of the 1980's.4 stars out of 4",10,1,1,3 August 2010
Goodfellas," 'The Godfather' with a little humor.
","This movie is great. I just have such a good time watching it. It is at the very top in the genre of crime dramas. The characters are very, very memorable. The film has a nice sense of humor, and conversations are very well written. I am very entertained while watching it. A very big part of that is due to the actors having a lot of charisma in their roles. Joe Peshi is the best example of this. He is very violent and easily tempered, and does a good job at adding more to the character with his great acting. It is a very big part of of crime drama history. It is a very good film that I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't enjoyed it.4 stars out of 4",10,0,0,3 August 2010
The Wizard of Oz," Simply a classic
","Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic. There is no reason not to like it. The songs are great, the characters are some of the most likable in history, it never feels slow, and it is just so entertaining. The effects for the time were great. The colors are bright and energetic. Do I really need to say anything about this film. People have said that they love it for years and they will continue for years. It is one of my favorites also. It brings a smile to my face watching it. It makes me feel good to be part of something that is passed down from generation to generation like a baseball glove that belonged to your grandfather, or a ring that belonged to your grandmother. It feels like something that brings us together. We are all brought together through this classic.4 stars out of 4",10,5,7,2 August 2010
Up in the Air," The Decade's 'The Graduate'
","Fantastic acting, directing, writing, and feel. Up in the Air is a film about life and what we do with it. The film gives me the same kind of bittersweet feeling that The Graduate has. Is this film as good as that cinematic classic? No, but it sure is fantastic. George Clooney and everyone else in the film give a fantastic performance. The jokes are funny, and the dialogue is very well done. It sometimes gives you a smile, and it sometimes punches you in the gut. The cinematography is great. The scenes of him him in the airport look fantastic. With Juno and now Up in the Air Jason Reitman's career is soaring into the big movie making sky.4 stars out of 4",10,0,2,29 July 2010
The Godfather," The film that every crime drama after and to this day is inspired by.
","This film is pretty much one of those perfect movies. I see nothing wrong with this amazing film. The acting is fantastic, the score is excellent, the writing is great, and the cinematography is beautiful. When people think perfection in film making they usually either think 'Citizen Kane' or this. It is expertly told story that spans through many years. The characters are great, and the relationships they have feel real. The story unfolds excellently, and by the time it is over you felt like you were part of the film. It is without a doubt the most influential crime drama ever made. This film is pure artistry at its finest.4 stars out of 4",10,1,4,26 August 2010
