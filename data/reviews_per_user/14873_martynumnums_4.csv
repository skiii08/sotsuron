The Avengers," Adrenaline pumped thrill ride that delivers near perfection
","I did not envy the mammoth task that Joss Whedon had in front of him. Some seriously good characters had been developed in some very impressive comic book films already, so he had to tread very carefully in order to not destroy what had been carefully created. He then had to bring them all together into one film and make sure that they 'all' had a purpose and that one did not outshine the other.So did it work? Well the answer is YES, beyond anything we could have expected too.Okay the plot is not original in anyway and it was fairly predictable but I wasn't going to see The Usual Suspects, after all what do comic characters do? They fight bad guys and save the world and that is exactly what we get. What really surprised me, is how some of the characters that only had minor roles in the previous films rose to the occasion and held their own, The Black Widow and Hawkeye really played their part which, before I had seen it, I was sceptical about. Captain America never really over impressed me in his own outing, he was good but that's it, in this he shone through becoming a vital leadership role, coordinating the Avengers throughout the end battle. Thor did his bit, probably the only character that didn't bring us anything special. Loki was outstanding, clever, funny and likable, something that Bruce Banner amusingly points out. Of coarse Iron Man steels the show, did we expect anything less from Downey Jnr, however a close match was The Hulk, who delivers some of the best moments in the film.The end battle is everything you expect it to be and if you are seeing it in 3D you are in for a real treat. The humour is absolutely spot on. What Whedon does best with all of the characters, no matter what world they are from, they are very human in nature which I think is the biggest key to the success of the Marvel comic book films, everyone has a sense of humour and through major life threatening situations they still keep it. Nobody is too serious.There are a few people that feel they have to go against the norm and put a film like this down, maybe they feel that by becoming a Simon Cowell and are very hard to please that makes them feel powerful and respected but the truth is that it is very sad that people behave like this. The bottom line is that all films are really supposed to be is entertainment, if you want to cry you go see The Green Mile, if you want to laugh you go see American Pie, if you want gore you see Hostel and if you want to see blockbuster action you go see Avengers Assemble.A film should be taken for what it is and if you go see this film for Oscar winning performances and clever plot twists then I'm afraid you will be extremely disappointed and quite frankly you should keep your opinions to yourselves. People are relying more and more on reviews to decide whether they should bother to go and see something and a good film reviewer should be flexible enough to see through the eyes of the audience it is aiming for.Ignore the bad reviews, if it's big scale action with vibrant characters and great humour you are after then you cannot miss this gem, the last time I was buzzing like this after a film was when I saw Jurassic Park on the big screen for the first time when I was 13 years old. Bring on the sequel!",9,3,8,4 December 2012
Star Trek," Finally a Star Trek film for everyone
","I always enjoyed Star trek but I was never a big fan. There were good films like Khan and first contact but nothing great...until now. From the emotional opening it set a completely different and more down to earth tone. Cutting out the technical jargen it focuses more on the story of true friendship forming from completely different personalities. The characters are lovable, the humour is sharp and the action is incredible. Sadly the old school trekkies who do not like change will be the only ones who may not enjoy this. This was one of the greatest imax experiences i've ever had and from the feel of the audience everyone had a fantastic time. Entertainment at it's best. Thank You J.J.",10,1,3,11 July 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Jacksons Return to Middle Earth is a triumph
","Once again the idiotic critics and members of the public who think they are great by putting down big blockbuster movies are so far out with their judgement of this film. If you do not like fantasy adventure films then don't judge it, your opinion is meaningless.I haven't seen the 48fps version, only the basic 3D version, so I cannot comment on the TV like film quality that has been reported, the quality of what I did see was great but I must say the 3D didn't add much to the film and I am a fan of 3D so do not expect too much from it.So let's address the major issue people seem to have with this film, it's far too long. Yes it is long, yet none of it feels like it was out of place or did not drive the film forwards. I did leave the cinema feeling quite worn out and I do have to be honest, just before the end of it, I was preparing to go, which is a clear sign that i'd had enough and was ready to go. It is a film that must be experienced on the big screen, so unfortunately you have to take the rough with the smooth but it is a small price to pay for such an epic adventure. If I was to have one criticism it would be that there was a little bit of repetition with the fight scenes, they usually began with someone in trouble and just as they are about to meet their end 'AH HAAA!' The dwarfs jump in to the rescue, it appeared to happen quite a lot but I'm sure when I watch it again it will probably not be as bad as I recalled. I also found Gandalf shouted 'Run' quite often, since most of the film is spent running I would have thought Gandalf would have guessed that they get the idea by now. These are minor niggles and nothing that can have an effect on my 9 star rating. The only reason it didn't get a 10 is that Lord of the Rings so far for me just had an increased amount of tension drawing me in more so I couldn't justify rating it alongside a perfect trilogy....yet.Martin Freeman was absolutely flawless as Bilbo and brings so much to the character. The dwarfs were all likable in their own way, it was great to see Gandalf back in action. Gollum was great as to be expected. Howard Shore's epic score is incredible and creates yet another heroic memorable theme, adding excitement to even basic chase scenes with not much going on.Peter Jackson has done the series proud and once again delivered a wonderful adventure with jaw dropping visuals and action sequences. If you have read the book then you know that it's going to get darker and a lot more traumatic, the best is yet to come.",9,8,19,23 December 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Great end to a fantastic trilogy
","When Batman begins first came out I wasn't sure how you could do any better than the first Michael Keaton film. How wrong I was! Nolan has done a fantastic job reinventing the series, The sequel was almost as good as the first and gave us an outstanding performance from Heath Ledger which will always be remembered. So he had to get it right again and once again he does not disappoint.There was always a worry for me that putting Catwoman into a comic book film that Nolan has really tried to keep as realistic as possible would add a camp over the top element to it but Anne Hathaway played it brilliantly and looked stunning in the tight leather outfit, I would have said cat suit but it's only hinted as one with a clever use of glasses for ears.Tom Hardy was great as ever, he even managed to show his emotions through a thick mask. Once again another incredibly memorable bad guy has been brought to us. My only criticisms would be that occasionally it was difficult to understand what he was saying, I found myself having to really concentrate hard to follow the dialogue. Also without giving anything away he goes from a menacing, very intelligent force to be reckoned with that was always one step ahead of everyone, to a basic vulnerable thug quite quickly and I feel such a great character deserved a better finale.I also found that if I thought too hard about what the overall logic behind the city destruction plan was there were several plot holes.....but this is not based on a true story and there was nothing too obvious to take you out of the action so it really didn't matter too much.The film is quite long but moves at a relentless pace, with Hanz Zimmers pounding soundtrack to keep us gripped along with some incredible action scenes, sit back, switch off and let Bane and Batmans clash unfold in a nicely wrapped up ending to a fantastic trilogy, it's just a shame it's all over.",9,9,15,4 December 2012
