Scarface," Expected More
","First time watching in 2020. I don't know if it's because I've seen my share of 'gangster' films, but didn't quite enjoy this one. 80s synth soundtrack didn't help. Predictable and depressing. Acting was ok-- sometimes over-the-top-- but was expecting more from this classic De Palma film. Perhaps it just didn't age well.",6,1,2,17 January 2020
Aquaman," Beautiful colors
","I'm a fan of Marvel movies in general, but this was kind of a mess, only passably enjoyable as a popcorn flick. Momoa seems to be having fun, but I was mostly left dazzled by the colors and CGI and not really engaging with the story. (Spoiler) When Aquaman finally obtains his MacGuffin trident, what does he do? He rides a leviathan creature into battle, resolving the central conflict in two minues (deus-ex-machina) amid more trippy, undersea Star Wars CGI effects. Meh.",6,0,1,11 January 2019
Marriage Story," Excellent acting; so-so story
","I got emotional during a few scenes (A. Driver is particularly poignant), but the story dragged and I don't think it ultimately led anywhere. That was probably the point, but as a movie experience, I was left feeling little by the end.",7,4,6,13 December 2019
