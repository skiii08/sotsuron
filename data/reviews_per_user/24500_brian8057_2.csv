Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More Needed from 3D
","Before I begin I must say I love the star wars saga, its just amazing but....I really don't know why after all this time George Lucas has had he aloud episode 1 to only be converted to 3D with no added extras. It deserved an update with new added extras just for 3D. The technology wasn't used very well for this film I really do hope he has some ideas up his sleeve for the rest of the saga. Surely he must have some clippings somewhere or he could even open up to other people to design things for the 3D versions.I expected the text at the beginning to jump out the screen but they never, I expected lasers coming at me and got nothing.Must try harder Mr Lucas, us fans are total fans and deserve the best.",5,5,9,18 February 2012
Spider-Man 3," To much Love story not enough spidey!!!!
","Firstly I would like to comment on the good points about the film. The action was brilliant, from the sandman to venom it was great. The CGI was flawless and I really enjoyed seeing Venom off the comic book and onto the screen.Now onto all the things I hated about this. The love story between Peter and Mary Jane bored me to tears I just wanted her to get squashed by the taxi to end it. I really like Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Mcguire but they were both very poor. The dancing and singing parts were cringe worthy and it turned into a comedy rather than an action film.I had been really looking forward to seeing this film but I am afraid it was totally spoiled by the dancing and singing and the fact the love out weighed the action.Come on we really wanted to see spiderman not the peter parker show.",6,0,1,23 July 2007
