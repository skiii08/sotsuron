Ford v Ferrari," Really really good...
","Ford vs Ferrari is one of the best movie ever made. It's an almost perfect Movie. If you've not watched yet, stop reading this and go watch this 2hr 32min race. I don't know much about racing car things or how those race happen, but i really enjoyed the movie. It feels like I'm inside the car driving with Ken miles(Christian bale). Music and BGM is perfect. One of the few Recent movies with perfect ost. It's based on true events which makes the movie even better. Christian bale (ken miles) steals the show . Matt Damon is also exceptionally good. Movie is like ford vs ferrari vs Shelby and ken. The real champion is ken miles. Definitely a must watch movie. Please go watch the movie.",9,2,3,18 February 2020
