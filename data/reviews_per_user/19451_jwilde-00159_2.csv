Casablanca," A Triumphant Success
",A Well Acted And Written Masterpiece Casablanca Achieves What Most Modern Dramas And Romance Movies Strive To Be And More.,9,0,1,27 December 2018
Bird Box," Very Flawed But Somewhat Original
",Birdbox is a very Intriguing film. Unfortunately though no actor in this movie could save how poorly written the movie was. What could've been a terrifying and ultimately disturbing movie turned very quickly into a clichÃ© mess of a film. Sandra Bullock's character was well acted but poorly written and the rest of the cast was the same. One thing I do love about the movie is the idea that the creatures show you your deepest fear or loss and that it drives you to insanity. It is a shame that is the only thing I like about this movie.,5,1,2,27 December 2018
