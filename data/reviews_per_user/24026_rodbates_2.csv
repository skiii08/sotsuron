Hereditary," Completely fell off
",Great start to a film but it fell off suddenly at the end with a dumb and confusing ending.,5,0,0,19 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Okay movie with unlikeable main
","I love how everyone likes to call out people giving the movie 1 Star reviews. The same could be said for people giving it 10 stars. I gave the movie a chance but it was mediocre at best. While watching, I looked over at my girlfriend and she wasn't enjoying it at all. We stopped the movie and discussed why. We both came to the conclusion that the main character was so unlikeable she was coming across as a villain. We finished the movie and it wasn't much better. A different actress with a different portrayal would have made this movie much better. If you are looking for a good super heroine movie, stick with Wonder Woman, it is much better.",5,3,4,11 June 2019
