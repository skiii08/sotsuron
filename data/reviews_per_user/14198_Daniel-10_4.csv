Antz," Ants X Bugs
","Antz was nothing more and nothing less than I expected. A very well done, virtually and incredibly made film.The history is very imaginative: An ant, named Z, who is tired of being just another ant in the oppressive colony, where no individuality is allowed. He dreams about reaching a legendary place name 'Insectopia', and his dreams end up to cause an involuntary revolution. There are many other interesting characters too, all performed by an all star cast, and I say performed because they were so fantasticaly developed. Gifted not only with the stars' voices, but also with their facial expressions, personality and everything else that can make us  recognize the person behind the bug.Everything in this movie seems to be carefully made, everything in the right place, everything with so much quality. But that nameless and unknown thing that makes the movies magic is missing. I don't know why, but, despite all its qualities, this is, somehow, a forgettable film.Disney has been threatened by a Russian princess named Anastasia and retaliated with Mulan. Now, these little ants are ready and willing to eradicate some bug's lives. But, by what I saw in the trailers, who will win in the end is a God's buddy, the holly prophet Moses.",7,0,0,26 November 1998
Blade," Just another one with lots of effects
","When I saw, in the newspaper, the document that Lars Von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg signed, named dogma 95, I thought it was the most stupid thing I had ever read. Some reviewers  has taken it seriously now that the first example of it arrived here (Vinterberg's 'Festen'). I haven't changed my mind, although seeing Blade made me, at least, understand it.Here, in Brazil, we didn't see Woody Allen's 'Deconstructing Harry', Ang Lee's 'Ice Storm' and some important others yet; mostly because our theatres have been busy during all this year with films like this. Films where the leading role is played by special effects.The modern techniques aren't guilty at all. What would it be of great masterpieces like '2001: A Space Odyssey' or 'Star Wars' if they didn't exist? But, what's sad, and this is the worse thing about 'Blade', is when you clearly see that some scenes were created just to justify astonishing effects. Sometimes you start to wonder if you're watching a movie or a cartoon. Do you remember 'Spawn'?This movie has no characters and, therefore, no performances to be remembered; but I was expecting this. The plot could be resumed to 20 minutes and the action scenes are weak. So you can wait until it's released in video.Marvel's Blade is not published here, but I really love other comics characters and, still, I have to say that no superhero has conquered a respectful place in movies yet, not even Batman. Well, I'm waiting anxiously for the X-men and, for now, I'm going to see 'Festen' to see if these danishes are better filming than they are when making statements.",6,0,2,3 December 1998
There's Something About Mary," There's nothing about this film
","Do you know what's the worst thing about a film like this? It's that after watching it, you don't want to go to the movies anymore.Ok, it was all my fault, as long as nobody asked me to watch it. But I tried to forget all I had read before about it and also forget that these Farrelly Brothers had made such a terrible stuff like 'Dumb and Dumber', which I couldn't see till the end, and I swear I tried to.But I had only two options near home: 'Knock Off' or 'There's Something About Mary' and I thought that it could, at least, make me laugh on this rainy Monday. Do you believe I couldn't even smile ?First of all, I really don't appreciate this kind of rude humor (by rude I mean unspeakable words more impolite than this film). Mistaking sperm for hair gel? Getting the genitals caught between a zip fastener? Are these things supposed to be funny?.Besides, this brainless movies, like Austin Powers too, that are originally made for you to rest and enjoy them, without the obligation of thinking, are, actually, very boring.Not that I don't like funny and easy movies, but this is too much for me.",1,3,6,23 September 1998
Eyes Wide Shut," Blame it on the gossips!
","Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise in a Kubrick's movie? Well, everybody read and heard many things about it, but you know what KUBRICK means in a motion picture. When he was not perfect like he was in '2001' and 'A Clockwork Orange', he was high above the average like in 'Lolita' and 'The Shining', for example. In addition, Kidman and Cruise are not only the most gorgeous couple of the movies but they are, indeed, very talented. Then Kubrick died, what meant that it was the last chance to see a new production with his name. Mix these facts with all the gossip that came before the movie itself and so here it is: the most awaited movie of the year, along with Star Wars, maybe.These facts are well known, but you have to recall them cause it explains why some of the Kubrick's fans got a little disappointed with 'Eyes Wide Shut'. It's not a fine situation cause, usually, you don't know where the emotions of the related facts end and where starts the impact of the movie itself. Besides, you will never get surprised cause you expect nothing less than the best.Well, the movie is a genius' work, no doubt about it. In the beginning, you may feel a little strangeness: Kidman and Cruise seem a little dislocated. Wouldn't they bear the responsibility of being in a Kubrick's movie? No way. When the scene of Kidman's confession gets, this problem is already gone and then the rhythm starts to flow in Kubrick's way. It's a delightful experience.Moreover, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is not in the same level as '2001', but what kind of movie would be? Now, when you compare it to the other movies that were released lately, it stands alone in the top. Isn't it what a Kubrick production is all about?",9,2,3,28 September 1999
