Hereditary," We found this to be a waste of 2 hours
",We had such high hopes for this movie from reviews I read. Unfortunately we found it to be one of the worst movies we've ever seen. I read a review that said how scary it was. We just kept waiting for scary but it didn't come. I found it more depressing than anything. Very disappointing thumbs down 👎🏻 for me,1,3,6,12 September 2018
