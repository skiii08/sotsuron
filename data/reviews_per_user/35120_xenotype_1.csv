Alien 3," A visual and atmospheric dark sci-fi experience
","First of all, I have to say I was shocked, to see such bad reviews and low ratings for this movie, here on IMDb.As a huge fan of the Alien series, I consider myself very rigorous about the content of any Alien franchise product (whether it is a game or another movie). Also, I have to admit, that when taking 'Alien' and 'Aliens', into consideration, Alien 3, is really not much of a deal in terms of shock, which the first two Aliens brought to the overall cinematography. Maybe thats what those poor reviews are about? One must take into account, the amount of production problems this move has gone trough. Huge and rapid changes of scripting, budget problems, lack of trust in Fincher's style just to name a few. Also, the movie is extensively cut, to suit FOX's time and style demands (The whole material Fincher had shot for this movie, lasted approx 13 hours). Another thing worth noting, is that Alien 3 was facing a 'cancel order' from FOX a few times...As for the actual movie:The overall acting performance is at the top level, with excellent choice of actors. Almost every character is unique, with some special characteristics. Of course, this is not even close to the marines from Aliens, but hey, Cameron was already a master when he directed Aliens. Fincher was just beginning. Also, there's a lot more characters in here.As for the atmosphere, I believe that in certain moments, it draws near to that of the original Alien masterpiece. The feeling of a 'man-hunt', a strictly no-chance situation, with the prisoners unarmed, trapped in a huge maze of tunnels and corridors, really IS the thing you should be able to get from any Alien movie. Alien 3 has it.Also the artistic level of the movie is simply great. The machinery and structures of the massive foundry are all covered in rust and dust, giving an old, dirty touch to the whole movie. The sets are absolutely amazing in scale and design. Especially the new ones, shown in the Director's Cut edition. Some even getting close to a picturesque feeling, just like in Blade Runner. The movie is masterfully shot (Thanks to Fincher's touch), especially the final corridor-chase sequence.Elliot Goldenthal's score to Alien 3 is undeniably harsh, frightening, and one of the most unique scores ever to be composed. It works great with the overall 'rusty' touch in the movie.Was it made just to make some more money out of Alien franchise? No! It still brings a lot of important plots and ideas to the whole Alien world. Also, it beautifully ENDS the Alien story (Alien 4, is a misunderstanding for me).Having seen it quite a few times now, both the first (cut) release and the second (director's cut, almost 40 minutes of never seen before material) I am absolutely convinced, that this is a great Sci-Fi movie. It's a bit different Alien. Different in terms of color, atmosphere and approach the the overall idea of an Alien movie. Still, I strongly believe, it is an important installment into the Alien series. Born in terrible pain, still managed to become an object of cult for Sci-Fi and Alien fans.An important Sci-Fi classic, worth remembering. Also a great debut for Fincher!P.S. If you happen to have access to the Alien Quadrilogy release, check the special features regarding Alien 3! An eye opener for me!",8,6,63,11 December 2008
