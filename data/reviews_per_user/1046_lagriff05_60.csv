The Blair Witch Project," I'm at a loss for words
","This is the storied 'classic' of 90s horror, filmed in the woods by a bunch of kids from UCF, from what I understand. It's about three college students doing a documentary about the 'Blair Witch', and it goes well until they end up lost in the woods. The movie descends into a spiral of minimalistic fear and uncertainty. Quite a different film from what people in 1996 were used to.Is it a good movie? Not really. Does it work as a horror film, and is it scary? Sure, why not. This is a very minimalistic movie, no special effects or costumes or anything. No makeup. Just a bunch of kids trying to scare people, and it worked. This is some very creepy stuff at times. While it inspired countless lame knock-offs and independent films after it, I can't deny that this is a milestone. Nobody had seen anything like this before. The woods make for a very creepy setting, and the actors do their jobs surprisingly well for an indie film.It sort of starts somewhere and then just...ends at random. Like a journey that you'd take, a pilgrimage. No climactic ending and no clear-cut introduction. Unique way to do a movie, for sure, but it's not really the pinnacle of film-making. There isn't any 'good triumphs evil' story, and it's all pretty bleak and dark. Not exactly the kind of thing you want when you feel depressed.I'm sort of at a loss for words at this one. It's just something every horror fan has to see in their lifetime, at least once. No rating, it's too hard to decide for this kind of film.",Null,0,1,16 June 2007
Angels & Demons," Faithful and unremarkable.
","I remember reading the Dan Brown book about four years ago now, and here I am watching the movie. First things first, let me just say what a remarkable job the director and writer did keeping everything true to the original novel, with only a few things that I can remember not being here - quite a remarkable feat, and between this and Watchmen, 2009 is truly a year for great book-to-movie adaptations.However, really this is just a standard action movie otherwise, as it isn't really pulled off with enough gusto to really remain captivating. The acting is passable, the directing is passable...everything is just rather adequate. It is a lot of fun at times, but it's also a bit boring at times - possibly reflecting here on Dan Brown instead of the screenwriters? Whatever the cause, this movie is a bit of a mixed bag between good stuff and stuff that will make you want to fast forward a bit. Angels and Demons may not be a genre transcending movie but it is a lot of fun, and if you're looking for a summer blockbuster...well, really, I guess you could do a lot worse than this.",6,0,2,27 June 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Yep, I liked this one better.
","Here's where things really kick into gear. Paying homage to cheesy martial arts flicks, Wild West shootouts, revenge flicks and more all in one go, the second half of Kill Bill could only have been topped if both films had been released in one box.Again, this isn't perfect, but it is extremely enjoyable. The plot comes into full here, and thus we are able to more fully enjoy Kill Bill. The film's saving grace is David Carradine, though, who is playing every bit the character I expect from Tarantino's flicks. Memorable dialogue and spot on acting and conviction ensure that Carradine's performance is ace, only aided by the excellent performances of a number of side characters. Kill Bill is truly an adventure, with the blending of genres a key point in its enjoyability, alongside Tarantino's signature stylistic eccentricities. There's nothing else like this movie out there, and for connoisseurs and lovers of film, this is pure gold all the way through.",8,1,2,4 April 2008
Requiem for a Dream," I'm speechless.
","This is a bleak, remorseless movie. It is so bleak, remorseless and depressing that I can't even really find words to say about it in a review. If director Darren Aronofsky's 2006 masterpiece The Fountain was the essence of love, eternal life and vigorous spirit, this movie is every bit the antithesis of those more positive themes.Aronofsky's directing is every bit as compelling as on his later work, starting off dreary, hazy and even comical in a twisted sort of fashion, but before you even realize it's happening, the storytelling is quickly contorted into a demented mad carnival-esquire thrill ride, finally fading out into a sorrowful, monotone-gray ending that will leave you thinking, depressed, and most of all, changed.The four main characters in the film are not deeply shaded with character development and intricate backgrounds. In contrast, the characters here are not really given colorful and detailed backgrounds, and we are provided with just sprinkles and minor tidbits of their pasts, making it very hard to know the meaning behind their motives and actions, and also making it so that we aren't going to start pitying these characters - we can fully see the consequences of their actions, not blinded by any misgivings we might have about what 'good people they all are underneath.' It creates a very shady atmosphere, Aronofsky has a talent for creating beautiful films on such scanty character development and plot background, and it's another part of what makes this good.This is a masterful film, and I can't really assign a rating to it...it's beyond all that. Not essential, but if you want a compelling, emotional, and endearing film that will tug at your heartstrings while making you reel back in revolted disgust, and also provide something thought provoking and dense, get this. It might not be something you'll be in the mood for all the time, but when you do go back to it, it will remain as powerful as before.",Null,1,2,10 January 2008
The Hangover," Hung Over from the Hangover.
","Hell, another good 2009 movie. For all my grievances about not being able to see Up, Moon and The Brothers Bloom all in one week, it seems like all of it is finally paying off, as I found this movie very entertaining.The comedy is hit and miss, but to be fair, it's mostly hit, with my only real criticism being that the characters are kind of stock - but then again, they're still enjoyable and really fun to watch, and surprisingly developed and well written in the end, too. The dialogue is good and the first forty five minutes or so are really good, with the random suspense mixture throwing you for loop after loop until the conclusion. The comedy, when it's really 'on,' is delightfully vulgar and silly, and the pace of the movie is great, sending you on a wild adventure that you won't forget any time soon, full of laughs.The ending seems to drag on a bit, but again, nothing that really hurts the movie. The Hangover isn't a modern classic, but it's definitely a good movie, and it kept me interested. Recommended. I really did like what they did with the ending credits, that was just great. Set this movie apart from others; and it didn't even make you wait until the ages of credits were done to see anything extra.",8,2,4,26 July 2009
Fight Club," An experience like no other
","It's so hard to review a classic like this. There's nothing you can find to say besides 'this rules, go buy it immediately.' But here's my stab at reviewing this masterpiece, and to date one of my favorite movies.This is a great movie. It's entertaining and very charming, and all the actors do a wonderful job. It's 2 and a half hours long, yet manages to keep you wanting more and more. It doesn't hold back either; there are a few pretty violent parts in here. The directing is top-notch, out of this world. Dark and surreal with a touch of silliness and satire in there, David Fincher's directing is genius and untouchable. Every scene here is extremely memorable; some touching, some humorous, and some riveting.The acting is through the roof, and Brad Pitt delivers one of his best performances yet. In every movie I've seen from the man, he manages to take on a completely new persona, disappearing into the role like a man into camouflage. There are no traces of his own personality here that we can detect, and he delivers a realistically insane performance, convincing us that he's not PLAYING Tyler Durden, but that he IS Tyler Durden. Ed Norton plays a hesitant and mousy little man being brought---forced---out of his safe shell and into the hard world, and he does it in a way that nobody else really could. I can't picture anyone else delivering the lines that Norton does here. Of course, the other actors are great as well, but I'm only going to mention our main two due to time constraints.The story isn't told in a traditional sense, but rather 'read' like a narrator's commentary in a novel, and I've never quite seen anything like it. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that it was originally a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and David Fincher tied it all together, giving us a very memorable narration that we view like we read a novel. One of my favorite attributes of the film.Now, that plot may sound odd when you read it without seeing the film, but this is a very deep movie. It's telling us to let loose a bit, showing us that we worry too much over materialistic possessions. And we do, that's the problem. The Narrator had so many material possessions in his home, bought everything the finest, but was he happy? Do materialistic things ever make us happy? Does having a white-collar job and a nice home guarantee happiness and security? No, and that's what Fight Club wants to tell us.The fight club itself...it's an escape from reality of sorts. Men who were trapped in a vicious, dull cycle of life found their escape by coming down to the fight club and letting their aggression out, having fun. The Narrator's view on life is a pessimistic one, and he sees our consumer-obsessed culture, although he is not able to escape it. Tyler Durden is somewhat of a polar opposite for the Narrator, with his carefree attitude and explosive ideals. This movie's overall theme is to stop conforming, to just say 'screw it' and destroy everything in your way. Destruction leads to salvation. Chaos leads to order, as is stated in the film.In conclusion, this is essential for anyone who likes good movies and can stand a bit of violence. My highest recommendation.",10,1,3,16 June 2007
Memento," Problematic.
","This is just...I don't even know. I watched this years ago and was really blown away by its odd structure, but really it's rather simple once you get a grip on it - heinously simple, even. It's told backwards in a linear line and interspersed with black and white shots of the lead actor telling us the back story, so what? This movie is given a lot of credit for being complex, but it's not that mind boggling when you think about it. And the ending just feels like a huge slap in the face, especially after all that build up and guessing...it's deceitful! And a lot of the first half of this is just too dull at times - especially the bits where the lead character is telling you about his client in the past who had a similar condition. It just feels too forced; they could have done it in a better and more interesting way. But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a good movie anyway. The deceit of the ending has its purpose and everything is fulfilled in the end; I just can't help feeling a little odd about it anyway. The strength of this movie just lies in the suspense that comes with it. Deceitful or not, it keeps you watching and guessing until the end. Sigh, this is a really dividing movie, as you can tell. You just don't know what to think about it, and I guess that's another good thing about it. Memento is a perplexing case and I would recommend it if you like thrillers - although you could always do better, this one definitely stands out.",7,2,4,26 August 2009
Inglourious Basterds," A movie fan's movie.
","I haven't seen every Tarantino movie yet, but this one is clearly the best one next to Pulp Fiction that I have seen, I can say that much. Quirky, blazing with the kind of wit that Tarantino is famous for and topped off with a dose of nasty, gritty and rogueish violence. This movie is pretty sprawling, featuring a host of characters and plot niches that span over a huge 2.5 hour timeline, and surprisingly it manages to entertain for most of it, despite some scenes that could have been trimmed down for the sake of the story. Throughout its duration, Basterds delivers memorable scenes, memorable and witty dialogue and outrageously precise directing that all comes together for a smash hit of a movie, right on the bullseye. And I think what sets this apart from the other recent Tarantino films is that it actually stands on its own two feet and delivers its story mightily and without the somewhat doddering eccentricity of Kill Bill or Death Proof - both of which were good, but not this good, not quite this complete and breathtaking. This is a movie fan's movie and I am proud to have seen it. Highly Recommended.",9,3,11,26 August 2009
Shaun of the Dead," A modern day classic.
","Ah, those epic zombie gore drama-comedies. Such a great genre of film. I absolutely loved last year's Hot Fuzz, so it was a given that I would have to check out this one, too, and oh man, it did not disappoint.Shaun of the Dead is a film that transcends genres and forces you to roll with it as it jettisons through a huge romp full of humor, blood n' guts and some downright tear-jerking moments that honestly surprised me, given the light-hearted nature of Hot Fuzz. This is not a stupid movie, as it knows what it is doing and does it well. All of the jokes are well placed and brilliantly timed, and everything ties together in the way you'd expect - but that doesn't make the ride any less glorious. Superb film.",10,2,5,5 December 2008
Oldboy," Lives up to the legend
","(Written December 2006)So this is the revered Korean film Oldboy, the legendary underground film everyone talks about. I've heard some really bad reviews of this one recently, as I looked into it at IMDb. Saying it was violent, sexual, etc, and that it was just a sex/gore flick and nothing else. It turns out that this movie is very violent and very sexual, and like most underrated movies like this one...it is very good despite its content.The plot is very intriguing---a man, Oh Dae-su (who's name means 'Gets through the day'), kidnapped off the street and locked in a prison cell with a locked door and no windows for 15 years, and then finally released, given new clothes, a cell phone, and a wallet. His mission is to find out why he was imprisoned, and with newfound fighting skills gained in his 15 years of spare time, he plans to do exactly that. He meets a young woman named Mi-do, who is very attracted to him, and she ends up dragged into the twisted revenge plot. It all comes down to a shocking, violent conclusion.I'd say this is about as good as all the good reviews make it seem. It's compelling, dark, twisted, and gory, carrying with it a strong lesson of what a lust for revenge will do to a man. Oh Dae-su was a sleazy, gossiping fool who let his mouth get the best of him, and it got him into a huge mess. He became a cold, bloodthirsty killing machine after 15 years in solitude, completely changed from the goofy young man he had been before. This is a film about revenge, showing us the consequences for lusting after 'justice' or 'revenge. A very brutal, stripped down view of human emotions. Oh Dae-su is driven by revenge, and as a result, ends up even worse off then he was inside his prison.People always hate on movies like this for violence or sexual themes, two things of which this movie, Oldboy, has quite a lot of. They insist that said movie is a 'gorefest' or a 'porno' without really looking any deeper into it. This film has sex and violence, yes, but it incorporates those themes into the plot, instead of wrapping a thin plot around the sex or the fight scenes. The incest is a touchy subject, but it's used as a plot point, not for sick fetishes. If you judge the movie based on this then you're missing out. This movie does not glorify incest or the numerous acts of violence Oh Dae-su commits throughout the film's 2 hour duration. Oh Dae-su is a tormented character; this is especially seen in his line 'After my revenge---will I be able to be Oh Dae-su again?' He's not evil and he's not enjoying the things he's doing---he wants to be his old self again! Not to mention the schizophrenic tendencies he gained in those 15 years alone. Oh Dae-su is not a hero, just a man who wants his peace of mind, and his revenge. You don't have to sympathize with him if you don't want to, that's not what the movie strives for. People who write this off as a gorefest or a sexfilm are not seeing the true essence of the film.The acting is good all around, especially by Choi Min-sik, who played Oh Dae-su. Very emotive, very angry, and a very powerful and convincing actor. Marvellous. Kang Hye Jeong and Yu Ji-tae did very well as Mi-do and Lee Woo-jin respetively.This movie is almost worth the price of admission for the great, driving, epic action scenes. That hallway scene...kickass...not to leave out the final, crushing fight between Dae-su and the silver haired bodyguard atop the tower. This isn't really an action movie, yet it has some pure action movies beat for real action. While far and between, the fight scenes here completely kill.Now as to why I didn't give this great film a perfect 10. It's good, and the director is certainly amazing. But this movie could've been cut short...it runs on for a very long time and instead of plodding ahead at a slow pace, some scenes fly by you at rocket speed before you know what happened. It left me feeling very confused at some points. Namely the scene before Oh Dae-su enters the prisonhouse, after he left Mi-do behind at first...I had to rewind it to see what I had missed, but even that didn't help. Still a bit fuzzy. I find that the numerous amount of different scenes was a problem also, some of them lacked memorability. The ending, too---I couldn't help but feel let down at the reason why the whole revenge plot was enacted. It was...anti-climactic, to say the least...not a very powerful or cohesive ending to such an otherwise great film.This movie is very good, despite any shortcomings, and I'll be checking out the director's other two movies very soon. Highly recommended to those who have strong stomachs and love a good mystery/thriller movie.",9,3,21,16 June 2007
Hot Fuzz," I can't believe I gave it a perfect score
","I had heard so much about this movie, from so many people, and my initial impression was 'just another goofy comedy movie', and I didn't put it on my 'HIGH PRIORITY, RED LIGHT FLASHING, GET THIS THING NOW!!!!111!!' list. Well it's a damn good thing my friend persuaded me to finally rent it a week or two ago, as this is honestly one of my favorite movies of '07 now.This is not at all a simple generic comedy film that will fade out of the public periscope of vision. No, this is a comedy of the highest level, boasting a good sense of balance between the funny, goofy parts and the more action-packed ones near the end (which of course are just littered with jokes and gags). I think the best thing about this is that it doesn't try too hard to be funny; it just IS. There are so many hilarious lines and situations here that it's impossible to mention them all. Just know that you're definitely getting your money's worth and more when you get Hot Fuzz, as this is a timeless, ageless, monstrous epic of a comedy that people will come back to time and time again.The acting is generally top notch, as is the directing. Everything seems to flow so well here, there's not an awkward moment to be found. Hot Fuzz moves at a blisteringly fast pace, and challenges you to keep up, softening it's rock-hard blows with laughter and comedy that seems to come in powerful surges. Most of the comedy here is gold, and shouldn't be missed by fans of any genre. Yes, any genre, that's right. I can't see too many people disliking this on the basis of pure entertainment value, since it packs bucketfuls of comedy, some high-octane, thrilling gunfights and action, and even gore for those odd little splatter-hounds amongst the audience.Bottom line: There aren't many words I can say about this masterpiece. It's funny, it's action packed, there are a few scenes that will touch your heart, and the plot is extremely involving and enjoyable. This is the type of thing you watch on a rainy day when you're feeling blue, the type of thing you can come back to over and over again and still enjoy the hell out of. This is Hot Fuzz, and this is a bona-fide classic for the ages.",10,0,2,11 September 2007
Orphan," Great new horror movie.
","Horror has been real stale for a long time now, with only foreign movies like (REC) and the borderline-horror Let the Right One In bringing anything worthwhile to the table. But what about America, the country that spawned the most popular icons of the genre? It's mostly been wallowing in silly remakes of shitty Japanese movies or bad PG 13 ghost stories - and let's not even mention SAW and Hostel - since the last half of the 90s. It's time for a real turn-around movie to bring America back to the forefront. The Descent was good, and those horror comedies like Planet Terror and SLiTHER were nice distractions, but we need a really good, kickass return to why horror is good in the first place. With that said...Orphan. I mean, good god. Where did this even come from? It's the most terrifying, depraved, downright evil movie I've seen out of a mainstream US theater in years! This movie is ballsy, not afraid at all to take risks or make you feel completely hopeless. I had no idea what was going to happen next at any turn in this movie; everything was shot in the dark and masterfully suspenseful. And yeah, of course the kid is evil, but she's built up in a way that makes you like her and feel sorry for her at first - something that even a good movie like Omen didn't do. I was honestly completely surprised at a lot of the things this movie did, from the twisted opening sequence to the final bloody chase through the snow. This movie is brutal and does not hold back, and I like that a lot about it. It doesn't even try to sugar coat the children from harm - I'm obviously not going to say I like this about it, but that's what makes it so goddamn SCARY, and that is why it rules. Where other movies would come off as silly doing some of the stuff here, and while some of it is a bit 'been there done that,' it's all just executed so well that I can't say no. Oh, and there are even a few comedic moments scattered throughout, adding an unexpected element of humor to the darkly chimeric mix here. They aren't too prevalent, but they're definitely noticeable. It doesn't lighten the mood, it just makes the movie more real. That's what any humor in a movie like this should do. Yeah, there are a few dull moments, and a few kind of generic scares, but those are in the minority. This movie is just supremely good, definitely the best horror movie I've seen out of the US this decade. Highly recommended to those of you who can't turn down a good headtrip every now and then.",9,3,6,26 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," Mediocre, not worth seeing unless you absolutely have to see everything Terminator.
","So this one has absolutely NO humor in it at all, and maybe that's what felt 'off' to me about it - it's just so thoroughly dark, bleak and plodding throughout, with even the action scenes having this weirdly dank feeling about them. This is a very foreign, detached movie, with characters you barely know due to changes in actors and new ones that you're not given time to be accustomed to, what with the generally pulverizing pace of the film, and I'm not sure that's a good thing, because this film is just so hard to really get into because of it. It never relents and gives you time to care about the characters like the old ones did; you're just supposed to accept who they are and be swept up in the ride. It doesn't even feel like a Terminator film a lot of the time, which is a big point against it - with some alterations, this could just be another random action epic. It seems stunted and incomplete.I do like the settings though, they were very, very well crafted. This entire film looked GREAT, that is for sure. The action was loud and in your face at all times, sometimes flat-out overwhelming the viewer, but always being really flashy and over the top. They aren't very captivating, though.Really, though, the ending DID leave me disappointed, being way too cliché and half-cocked for me to really feel inspired by it, especially after seeing the other movies so recently...",5,0,2,27 June 2009
Juno," The epitome of teenage inanity.
","If you haven't been living under a rock for the last few months, you've probably seen or heard of this movie. First off, this is actually a very good movie, speaking in strictly technical terms, but I don't like it. The acting is good, with Hard Candy star Ellen Page putting on an awesome performance, and the supporting cast being equally convincing, and the directing is fine. But everything else just drags the movie down in a steep slide.Mostly this is just too annoying and cutesy to ever be worth anything other than usage as a beer coaster. The character of Juno always has some sort of witty comment or snide remark, and - surprise! - all of the side characters usually do, too, and it is horribly irritating, a one-trick pony of a comedy cop-out that might make prissy teenagers laugh and feel endowed with a sense of superiority to their peers, but if you like good comedy, this will just come off as stale. The dialogue? MAN, THAT IS AWFUL. 'Yo yiggidy yo'? 'Forshizz'? And the overwrought use of 'like'? Barf-central. Jason Reitman seems to think that if he throws enough pseudo-witty jokes and one liner cracks at a wall, he'll create a Comedic Masterpiece, but it just doesn't work that way. There isn't anything really funny underneath all the 'hip' dialogue and the attempted wit.The soundtrack is almost as bad. A load of pretentious, sappy indie emo rock crapola that will do nothing but make you scratch your head and wonder why it's there. Oh, is that part of what makes this movie intelligent and deep? I'm sorry.But the real problem is the fact that this movie seems to try to be intellectual and deep with its story about teenage pregnancy and the emotional issues surrounding it, but the whole thing is encased in the sort of disgusting 'ironic' humor that seems to pass as thought provoking and soulful these days - Juno trivializes these issues and makes them seem small and insignificant (Juno referring to her situation as 'being in a pickle,' for instance...), and that shoots this right down the crapper. This is too candyflossed and fluffed up to achieve anything it sets out to do, and so it is a failure.",2,131,304,18 May 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," A bit half-baked, but I liked it
","End of the world movies these days seem to be dime-a-dozen, like Die Hard-esquire action flicks were years ago, and like PG-13 horror remakes sadly seem to be these days. This is another one of them, a prolific, epic film that tries as hard as it can to be intelligent and gripping. It wants to impress you with knowledge, special effects, and a very moving, risky, adventurous plot. But is it worth all that if your plot turns out half baked and unfinished? That's the deal with The Day After Tomorrow---there are the pieces of a really great thriller/action/post-apocalyptic film here, but nobody bothered to put them together.For instance, a plot involving our main character's wife and a young disabled boy whom she treats in the hospital where she works. This would've likely been a pretty good plot element, and it was touching from what little we saw, but nobody bothered to expand on it and make it an actual part of the story. It was just a tidbit on the side, barely even an element of the plot at all. The romance elements as well were there, just not expanded upon enough. In fact, most of the characters in general weren't as fleshed out as they could've been. Expanding upon their rather shallow exteriors could've made for a world-class movie, but alas that was not to be. The ending as well, felt very hollow, like they just had to end it to meet a deadline. It wasn't a bad ending, but it could've been so much more. And thus, we're left with a movie that feels like they didn't work as hard as they could've. This is a movie that tried to fit in elements from adventure films, a bit of romance, and of course some current world issues into one film, which apparently was too short to house all of it. All of these things just crush the film with their weight. Expanding the running length with a more fleshed out plot and characters would've benefited this, but it's entertaining nonetheless.It's not without it's merits, though, for this is still worthy of an 8/10. This is a movie with big money behind it, and of course all of the visuals are stunning, beautiful, yet absolutely devastating and terrible, chaotic. All of the special effects here were orchestrated perfectly, and thus this is a film best viewed on a large screen with surround-sound speakers. Tidal waves, tornadoes, snowstorms, and more, all in their whole, destructive forms. That's the best thing about this one, I'd say, the special effects. Too bad they sacrificed plot elements for it.

Spider-Man 3," One dimensional, childish, and flowery crap
","This was a complete and total surprise compared to the past two Spiderman films, and the surprise is that this one makes me want to claw my eyes out with a spork. This is complete and total nonsense. The previous two films were acceptable and enjoyable, so how did this turn out the way it did? I didn't really go into this film expecting anything, and my expectations were still smashed to smithereens by a gigantic bulldozer. Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.I do want to apologize for all the spoilers in this review, but I guess that's the best way to get my points across.The biggest issue here is how Sam Raimi makes a fool out of himself and defecates on the Spiderman legacy, completely destroying the story by setting it up so that Sandman killed Uncle Ben instead of the real killer, thus ruining the point of everything. He then further ruins it by having Spiderman and Sandman get all soft and emotional and forgive each other...seriously, what the hell? He also has Harry forgiving Peter and nullifying any notion anyone had of the two finally facing off and settling things in this one. They wasted the symbiote suit and wasted Gwen Stacy, as well as Green Goblin. Sandman is given a lame backstory that just wussifies the movie even further, and Venom is totally wasted. How will they patch this up in future movies? And Stan Lee has a cameo in this, too, how can he support this crap? I guess it's not AS bad if the creator doesn't care, but eh. Time to go back to Evil Dead, Raimi.Then we have Peter Parker going all lame after the symbiote infected him, and it's about where the movie really dips down below sea level and becomes bad. It's all mind-boggling and very idiotic, and we're given the impression that this isn't really Spiderman, but some sort of horrible modern romantic comedy instead. An embarrassment to a whole 50 years of Spiderman. Nobody ever thought it'd sink this low. I really don't think it'd be as bad if this wasn't Spiderman, but it is. Eddie Brock is played by Topher Grace, who asks Jesus to kill Peter Parker in one particularly awful scene, and generally brings the intelligence of the movie down further. Pretty funny though, but from what I understand, he went there in the comics to kill himself. Another example of Hollywood making light of what was once a dramatic scene, ruining art.I have a feeling this review will draw comments like 'you have to watch it as a MOVIE, don't think about the comics' or some other crap, but those people are setting their standards far too low. Sure, you can pretend the comics don't exist, and maybe that will make this abortion more enjoyable for you, but why take the easy way out? That's just flawed logic; like pretending a bad food dish is good by acting like you never tasted anything better. This fails on every level; as a comedy, as a super hero film, and as a Spiderman film. There's no need to compensate for what is clearly a terrible film. Directing? Nondescript. Scriptwriting? Bland and embarrassing. Raimi has failed. This is by far the worst movie of 2007, and it's not even over yet. Sad, because I really wanted to kick back and enjoy this.Oh, and people seem to like to complain about how there were too many villains, but that doesn't matter at all. That wasn't a problem in this movie for me in the least.The only enjoyable parts were Jameson's scenes and how Venom looked pretty cool. Too bad they didn't give him enough screen time and just made him into another 'kidnap Mary Jane to lure Spiderman out' villain. Blah. Action scenes were good, but there weren't many of them, as this is just a romantic comedy movie! It's entertaining, no doubt, but it's really not that good and was very annoying and infuriating at some parts. There were some good jokes and funny parts, but this is supposed to be Spiderman, not a sitcom.One dimensional, childish, and flowery nonsense that nobody should ever be subjected to. Not recommended to anyone.",1,2,2,16 June 2007
The Prestige," Devastating. You will be completely immersed.
","A lot of words come to mind upon seeing this again, and amongst them are 'brilliant,' 'devastating,' 'masterful' and 'diabolical.' The Prestige, for those so shamefully uninitiated, is a pretty much completely perfect film, taking the viewer down a dark, twisted road of revenge, lies and deceit as two former friends destroy each other.There isn't a whole lot wrong with this, and when I said back in March that The Illusionist was better than this, I must not have remember just how good this was. The acting is spot-on, with Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and co. becoming completely submerged in their roles, and the plot is wrapped in a thick, foggy sense of mysticism and intrigue, with parts of it mixed and matched accordingly to build up a level of dramatic tension that most movies couldn't dream of possessing. It grows higher and higher, like Jack's beanstalk, until the ending, which will floor you like no other film has since The Shawshank Redemption or Requiem for a Dream. The Prestige, when you look back, will take something out of you that can't be so easily replaced. My highest recommendation.",10,6,9,8 June 2008
Cloverfield," Believe the hype.
","Well this is totally unexpected, since I really figured I'd hate this one with a passion, but here I am with the revelation that it is indeed pretty cool, despite the wild hype surrounding it as of late.Cloverfield is not exactly the pinnacle of monster movies, but it is a creative and inventive twist on that sort of film, and the whole 'handheld camera' thing that everyone is whining about is actually done extremely well, much better than Blair Witch Project or similar films I've seen. Acting isn't the greatest, but it's convincing, and while the characters themselves weren't great, it's nothing I'd consider a huge detractor of the film.What I like the best about this movie is that it actually comes off as a convincing setup for what an actual alien attack would be like, if it were to happen. Our main characters are a bit reckless, but looking past that, I enjoyed this one. A worthy effort.",9,0,1,2 March 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Pretty good.
","This is like some sort of weird little Gothic love fairytale, and it's actually not the nu-crapola I expected previously, being quite an endearing tale. Johnny Depp isn't a good singer, but he makes up for that with stunning theatrics, the same way he did as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates films. Helena Bonham Carter's performance is great, too, and the supporting cast make for quite an entertaining viewing.The main problem with Sweeney Todd is just that it feels pretty campy and jovial compared to its subject matter, and it would've been a much better movie if the aforementioned camp had been turned down a few notches. Regardless, this is a fun watch, and I'd recommend it to people who aren't afraid of musicals.",7,0,3,18 May 2008
Lost in Translation," Spellbinding.
","This is a phenomenal movie centered around two lonely, misplaced people played by Bill Murray and Scarlet Johanson as they are both in Japan for career reasons. The drama level is high and the acting is great on all counts, with the atmosphere being mostly quiet and personal - certainly not the slick sheen of some other modern films. What I mainly like about this film is the incredibly realistic nature of it - it's just a movie about people, that's pretty much it. No pretension, no gimmicks, just a touching, funny and sometimes sad story about people and the way their lives interact and the way they think. That takes more talent than you'd think.I especially like how the movie has a little more respect for its audience and doesn't just lapse into a traditional romantic storyline with the typical trappings of that sort of style. Lost in Translation is interesting in that it doesn't do anything you'd expect - the characters never sleep together, there are no gratuitous sex scenes (or sex scenes at all), and when they finally kiss at the end, it's more sad than triumphant or sappy. Sure, these things aren't huge, but it's the little things that really matter in movies, and Lost in Translation emphasizes this more than anything.This movie doesn't sugar coat anything and it doesn't try to be any more cinematic than it has to be, and in that regards, it is worth a hundred miles more than any pre-processed comedy or romance movie you'll find some other big stars starring in.Lost in Translation is a movie that is just extremely pleasant to watch. Not everyone will like it, but a great many people will, and I'd recommend this wholeheartedly to anyone who likes and appreciates the art of film. Plus one for Focus; I'll be checking more of these guys' movies out.",10,0,2,27 June 2009
Romeo + Juliet," Why can I not go into negative numbers?!
","Oh my dear lord. The crap has hit the fan now. This is rock bottom. This is the stuff nightmares are made of. This is what the sinners will be subjected to when they're dragged kicking and screaming down to Hell after the world freezes over. Quite simply, Romeo + Juliet is one of the worst movies ever vomited upon this Earth, and it completely defecates on any and all aspects of William Shakespeare's classic play. Let us begin the dissection, then:I must stress how mind-numbingly stupid it is to make a modern, teenage romance/drama (especially an adaption of such a classic piece of literature), and keep in all of the 16th century dialogue. It's bad enough that they made it so nauseatingly queer in the first place, but that's just before you hear any of the characters talk. I shouldn't even have to waste time on why keeping the 16th century dialogue was a monumentally suck-tastic idea, but I'll just say that it makes everything incredibly awkward and messy. This is also partially due to the fact that they replaced the swords and daggers with loaded pistols, which look absolutely ridiculous in context with the storyline and plot. Also, what the hell is up with the characters walking around in Hawaiian button up shirts and khakis? Is this a joke?The acting is...how to say this...awful. The actors on display might be talented, but you'd never know it from this movie. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is extremely over the top and fake, and he manages to craft a marvelously whiny, intolerable little brat out of what was once a passionate young man stricken with tragedy, and he very much succeeds in making me want to murder him with a toothbrush in the most violent way possible. The other characters here are a bit closer to their original counterparts, but the acting is sub par and reeks of what you'd expect from a C-level porn flick instead of a romance drama.In conclusion, this is a travesty of modern art, and Shakespeare must be rolling in his grave now. It's a testament to this film's stunning banality when I say the only movies that I've ever seen that were worse, were subhuman B-horror movies. This is truly the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life, and I've seen a lot of crappy movies. Never see this movie, and if you are ever presented with the option of seeing it, seize it with both hands and break it into many tiny pieces, laughing maniacally as you annihilate it from this world. Avoid, avoid like the plague.",1,2,4,11 August 2007
Watchmen," Good but not great. Very faithful though.
","Well, the big day is finally here, and we've all been waiting for various amounts of time for the film adaption of the popular comic book spectacle known only as Watchmen. Made by the so-called visionary director of recent cinematic borefest 300, this movie was obviously a big target on everybody's radar, and I wasn't sure what to think of it - how could anyone, let alone Zack Snyder, make a film adaption of a book as layered, complex and involving as Watchmen? The answer to that question is, they took the easiest way out and just made the movie scene-for-scene with the book. Not a bad idea in the end, although there were a few minor changes. I'm quite frankly surprised how much fun this was to watch.I think the main draw here for the comic-book fans is the number of not-so-subtle nods to them in the way that the movie really did pull most of the scenes here right out of the book, dialogue and all. I mean, word for word, seriously. The most shocking part of this to me, aside from the abysmal opening sequence and the stupidly gory fight scene in the allyway, was the Dr. Manhattan soliloquy on the moon, which was actually pretty much carried out in full, flashbacks and all. Rorschach's journal is vocalized a lot of the time, too, and I kind of expected that. The flashbacks are all done with high regard to the novel, and a lot of the time I was just sort of nodding my head along with it, as the book was still fresh in my memory and none of it really surprised me.The violence was heavy, bloody and dark as Hell, and I was much more entertained here than I was watching big, beefy men with no shirts on sloooooowly stab each other to death in...you know, that other movie. Like I said, the beginning is silly, with the violence being kind of pointless and very poorly constructed, but after that it gets better. The scenery is awe-inspiring, with huge, bright, vivid landscapes filled with shadows and intricate details and everything else that's just icing on the cake. Just look at the city streets; V for Vendetta wishes it looked that good. And the scenes on Mars...holy hell! The costume designs, too, are all amazing, and it's a slap in the face to other comic book films that they made everyone look so much like they did in the original book. I mean...aside from Ozymandias, they look like they jumped right out of Alan Moore's graphic novel.Okay, so enough book comparisons, how was the movie as a movie? Well, this was very long, very detailed, and very over the top in every aspect. The explosions are loud, and they're bright, too; I had to cover my eyes a few times. The story is told in a very jumpy comic-book-esquire format, which is no surprise, although honestly I would have preferred a totally different adaption by a smart director like Chris Nolan instead. Everything moves fast, so fast that it gives the illusion of the movie being shorter than it is (and also being ironic in the way that 300 dragged more than a car with flat tires). The story is very stylized and charismatic, with the use of several songs during the 'bigger' moments that I actually liked a lot; they added an extra special something to the movie that I found charming and invigorating, even. Not something I'd like to see in every movie, but it works surprisingly excellently in this one. And yes, Dr. Manhattan's speech does get a bit tedious - working only in the book format, apparently; a direct copy-paste of the novel dialogue to a cinematic form is not a good idea - but for newcomers, I imagine it will at least be interesting to listen to, if not too long. And the great special effects will even keep the comic fans watching.The ending is quite a spectacle, with a new bit added in that I found quite cool; won't spoil it, though. It is a lot darker in some ways, a lot lighter in others, and more Hollywood-ized, and I found that it worked. Watchmen is about as good of a straight-ahead comic book adaption as we'll get these days, so far at least, and although it is not perfect, I found it extremely entertaining and definitely worth re-watching. It isn't particularly life-changing, lacking most of the gravity and weight of the novel, but it is a provocative, interesting look at superhero films, and those who have never experienced the novel before will be in for a real treat. Recommended.",7,0,2,27 June 2009
Armageddon," This just goes too far sometimes, but it's good
","I'll say it straight out, this movie let me down quite a lot. I wanted an epic badass of a film that would revolutionize the way I see movies. I got an epic behemoth of a film with more then ample doses of goofy monkeying around inserted sometimes at the most inappropriate of scenes. Bruce Willis stars in this movie along with Ben Afleck and Liv Tyler as two young lovers, and it's safe to say that there aren't too many complaints with the acting (although admittedly there were some weak spots there, too).No, my main problem with this movie is the comedy. Now, I'm all for comedy, but the directors of Armageddon didn't seem to be taking their own plot too seriously at some point. I was in awe at the utter stupidity of the characters in this movie, especially toward the second half of it, and specifically Rockhound (Steve Buscemi, who does do a very good job acting here anyway). We all need some lighthearted fun in our movies, but what we don't need is for the comedy to interfere with the dramatic parts of the movie, which it almost does a few times here. Rockhound's foolishness and monkeying around almost ruins several scenes and it doesn't fit with the whole theme of saving the Earth. Why did they even put the parts involving the stripper and then later the machine gun on the asteroid into the movie? It's safe to tell who we can all throw rocks at for ruining the movie. Why on earth is he so lenient about it? It makes no sense. I can say the same thing for most of the crew at the beginning, too, they seem awfully laid back for a bunch of guys about to go save the world. Bear was falling asleep and making comments about a hot girl during the teaching sessions. What? Like I said, I like comedy fine, but here it just hinders what would otherwise be a phenomenal movie.This movie is full of explosions (big explosions, too, we're not talking about little buildings. We're talking entire cities all at once here. That's epic.), romantic love scenes, and other action clichés. They're actually done quite well, until we get Rockhound or Bear making more dumbass jokes. The whole mishmash makes Armageddon look like a PARODY of the action genre at some points, and it hurts the score. A lot. If I were to see this movie without any prior knowledge of action movies, and having never seen one before this, I would get a flawed first impression of the genre. It's not quite to the level of Scary Movie and Date Movie, of course, but it's not an upstanding example of how to incorporate comedy into an action movie. See Die Hard 3 or The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for that. Sorry, but Armageddon just goes too far overboard sometimes.No, I don't hate this movie though. I do like it quite a lot. It's great fun for a Saturday night with friends or if you've been drinking (lol). The ending scenes with Willis and Afleck are very touching, as are most of the scenes involving Liv Tyler. It's also got some extremely triumphant moments, and the explosions and special effects are amazingly done. Check out those skies toward the end! The scenes with Chick (Will Patton) and his ex-wife and son are extremely touching, and are the saving grace of the quieter parts of the movie. Beautiful. And like I mentioned before, it's EPIC. In all caps, too. There aren't many other movies like this that can touch it in epic-ness. Not even Die Hard or it's sequels are more epic than this monster of a film.Recommended to action fans who can stand stupidity in their movie-viewing. I'll be watching this one again, too.",7,9,13,16 June 2007
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Solid, if very unnecessary.
","This Terminator movie continues in the line of classics by starting off very similar to how the first two did - opening with our main characters, and then introducing a Terminator, appearing in the nude and obtaining clothing and a vehicle quickly. This whole film can kind of be likened to a past-his-prime wrestler trying to overcompensate for his age, as it does kind of seem to be riding on the trends set by the first two...but hey, it's the goddamn Terminator, and this movie is entertaining as hell.Okay, okay, this movie is very unnecessary and goes against every moral the original two Terminator movies stood on. It takes a 180 from the moral of the last two, which was that you can choose your own destiny, and now apparently says that you CANNOT do that. I guess nine years off changes a film's direction a bit.I think another weird thing about this is that the Terminator series has always balanced humor with serious moments, but this movie is way darker than the others in thematic alone, with a more bleak outlook in general. The others were sort of hopeful in their darkness and chaos, with a light to guide our heroes out of it, and an overall triumphant feel, but this one is just dark and depressing. As such, the humor is a lot more vibrant and stupid this time around, clearly trying to lighten the mood of the overwrought plot.But really, this is just all about the high-octane fist-pumping action scenes, which are maybe a little more dragged out, but they still draw the viewer in with skill and class, with the first half of the movie being unbelievably good at it. T3: Rise of the Machines is not a classic, but it is a very good movie that I don't think Terminator fans will want to miss.",7,0,1,27 June 2009
The Orphanage," A ghost story for the mature.
","Such sophistication in ghost stories is rarely heard of, but Guillermo Del Toro manages to pull it off time and time again, and somehow he even managed to inject his magic into this one, which he only produced - as this very much plays out like one of his own films. Not to discredit Mr. Bayona, though, for he has done a fine job. This is a dark, powerful, and moving masterpiece that both adheres to convention and brings some new, more artistic elements to the table in the direction and storytelling.One thing I like about this one (and Del Toro's previous masterpiece The Devil's Backbone) is that it takes horror-esquire plot lines and twist them into something much, much greater than a simple ghost/horror story. This has style and class all the way through, and every bit of it is tailored to a polished sheen. There is an emotional impact to this that you wouldn't expect in movies of its kind - usually in a ghost story, the emotional layer is pretty thin, but here it runs as deep as blood. Well written character dialogue only adds to the reasons why this is so good.People will call this a generic ghost story, but those people aren't watching hard enough. The Orphanage may not pack as many jumpy, jittery moments as movies like The Ring, but it's not supposed to - this is a ghost story for the mature.",9,1,2,26 June 2008
The Shining," I am impressed.
","I was originally going to give this a slightly lower score, but it really is a very good movie. But let's be serious; as a book-to-movie adaptation this pretty much fails, as it takes an entirely different view of the story as compared to Stephen King's original novel. For the first half hour or forty five minutes of this movie, you will be questioning why certain things were not added, why certain things were changed and why everything else, but by the end you'll be hooked because this movie knows how to pull the scares with efficiency and great measure.The problems are as follows: there is barely any tension in the beginning of the film, no descent into madness or inner conflict with the Jack character. Where was that? This movie just skipped all of that and sort of jumped right into things, and while I enjoyed it, it could have been done better than it was. It didn't make any sense the way it was here, and the character development was pretty much a zero for every character. The first half of this film just sort of speeds by without really setting much up – don't get me wrong, this is great for what it is, but it would have been a real masterpiece if we had been given a slightly altered beginning that showed us more of Jack's 'normal' side, given us a reason to doubt his spiral into madness later on. And I don't think this movie really elaborated on the whole 'shining' concept much, which is silly considering the name of the movie, but whatever.We really do have to work with what we're given, and honestly, this really is a horror classic when you get down to bare bones. I mean, once things really kick off at about the hour and a half mark, the movie takes no prisoners. And by the two hour mark, it doesn't matter whether or not you want to see stuff from the book on the screen, because Stanley f*cking Kubrick is SCARING THE HELL OUT OF YOU. Seriously, the last half hour of this movie rules, everything about it does.Another great thing about this movie? Jack Nicholson. At first I thought he didn't fit the part of Jack Torrance, but really that was just because of the inconsistent pacing I mentioned above. No. Jack Nicholson's tremendous screen presence is one of the best things about this. He's just so entertaining to watch, even when he over-emotes things a bit. He does a really great job, even just playing 'himself.'One thing this whole movie does really well is suspense and tension, with ruthless camera angles creating a horrific portrait that you will not forget. This movie might be lacking as an adaptation, but that's the thing I've been learning lately with these things: you can't have a great movie that is also a book adaptation, because they're just two different mediums that require different things in order to be good. Yeah, Kubrick changed a lot here, but what came out in the end was really a very successful and well made horror movie that succeeds at what it is trying to do. The Shining is a blood-soaked horror classic that you won't want to miss if you haven't seen it already.",9,0,0,27 June 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Awesome, awesome, awesome.
","The differences between this and the first one are just night and day. The first one was good; very good, even, but this is just a whole other level of badassery. I'm going to have to divide this review into factions to explain it:The Action: The biggest feature here that everyone seems to talk about is the Liquid Terminator, or T1000, and goddamn if I'm not going to agree with them, because he is truly awesome. The action here is a lot of the time just proportionate to how create whatever the T1000 is doing is, with all of his metamorphic features. But there are still enough cool explosions here to satisfy me, too.The Story: A quite archetypal (and brilliantly told) tale of warning of apocalypse and action heroics, T2 also possesses an interesting moral qualm partially through involving human life and the intricacy within. T2 packs a little of just about everything, from action to science fiction to romance to drama, and it ties it all together in an explosive package that nobody should miss. There are a lot of cool little themes here too, like how the kid teaches Arnold things - and how the 'no killing people' thing is carried through with such style - or the evolution of Sarah Connor's character from the first movie to this one, and all of this interspersed with the high-octane action makes for a hugely gratifying experience.The epic scope, vision and dynamics of this movie are just incredible. It does so much and yet never manages to lose the viewers at all like some other movies might. Terminator 2 is a superlative movie and definitely one of, if not THE, best sequels ever made. See it if you haven't already, and remember, you CAN change your destiny.",10,4,5,27 June 2009
Being John Malkovich," John Malkovich is my friend
","Okay. Okay, I'm just going to...throw my hands in the air and disregard everything I ever knew about movies, because this film is just so...flat out bizarre, weird and boneheaded at times that there's nothing else to do about it. Let's just address the first and foremost question: Why John Malkovich? Did you just pick an actor's name out of a hat? Maybe I'm just too young or something, but god damn. You could have theoretically picked any actor, couldn't you? Did you just pick him because his last name is so catchy to say? I think that's why. Yeah, that must be it.Second...IT'S A MOVIE ABOUT A PORTAL INTO HIS BRAIN. Which is admittedly a really interesting idea; it sure sold me. This movie is just...I don't know, it's really strange and it really leaves an impression on you. There are a lot of things I like about this. It's artistic, it's cryptic and it's got really excellent writing. As much of a head trip (ha-ha) as this movie is, it sure is good at keeping you drawn in. There really is a sense of comedic genius at work here, just in the plot itself, and it's underscored with a heavy layer of remorseful sadness: this is, at its core, a movie about longing and chasing one's dreams. When you cut out the weird bullshit, that's what it is, and the unique way in which the movie shows you this just makes it stellar.But I do have some problems with this, like...god, what is up with some of the other comedy in this film? Like that stuff with the monkey with 'childhood trauma'? And the whole first quarter of this is pretty much just completely insane. A lot of the time it just leaves you gaping at the screen rather than laughing, and I'm not sure that's a good thing. The jokes are rarely funny and are more confusing and odd than anything, and it hurts the film, especially in the beginning.Being John Malkovich is one of a kind. It's really just...strange, but the gems here are hard to deny if you are actually crazy enough to stick around long enough for them.",Null,0,0,26 August 2009
The Machinist," Mindblowing
","I don't even know where to start with this. This movie does rule a lot though. It's one of those mind-bending films that gets you thinking about it for ages after it's over. This one will stick with you. The acting is all very good as is the directing, which is very dark and grungy. You're given bone-chilling view of a man's severed hand whirling in what would be his death machine, and the ominous view from below at the beginning of the film as you see Bale looking down, wondering what it is he's staring at. It's very fitting, and reminds me a lot of movies like SAW 3 or Session 9 (the latter of which was directed by Brad Anderson, same guy who directed this, which explains a lot), what with the overall creepy vibe set. The directing also managed to oddly remind me of Fight Club, which this movie reminds me quite a lot of plot-wise. Same principle.This is a psychological thriller, so it gets off by messing around with your brain. The Machinist does that quite well, and you're left guessing right till the end, where a plot twist is revealed that you probably never thought of. There were many instances in this movie where I thought I could predict what was going to happen next, but I turned out to be wrong 4/5 times! This one doesn't follow a formula. The use of foreshadowing is excellently done and gave a lot of depth and intelligence to this film, made you smile when you thought back on it after the end.I won't spoil anything for you all, but this is a phenomenal psychological thriller/horror flick, and any fan of the genre needed this yesterday. Also recommended to fans of Fight Club. It's a bit short, but who cares?",9,6,9,16 June 2007
American History X," Overrated and incomplete
","Well, this is a bit of a letdown, but then again, I went into it with a critical mind anyway, so it's not such a surprise. This is the much lauded American History X, and it is in fact a great movie, and I do mean truly *great*, instead of just *good* or whatever other adjective you might stick in there. What is 'great,' then? American History X boasts a sleek, crystal clear filming job and top-notch, through the roof acting, and it's obvious that this one wasn't let out of the gate until everything was just picture perfect all around. Yet, at the same time, this is not always good, with a few blemishes adorning its polished-to-perfection exterior. Yes, this is surely a giant of a film, but it does tend to stumble over its own feet a bit. Just a bit.Not modest or afraid at all, American History X is chock full of lengthly, rather rotund exhibits of preaching - and it is even mentioned once in the film - which is not a bad thing in itself. I hear lots of people crowing about how that's what's wrong with this movie, but no, it isn't. I don't mind it at all, and it mostly just serves as food for thought and a way of carrying the story along. But yes, there it is - this preaching, as it is so dubbed, carries the story far too much, overwhelming the movie like a blanket. The problem with this movie is that it's incomplete. Come on, are we really supposed to believe that all of this - the party, the talk, the flashbacks, the death - happened in one night? Are we honestly expected to believe that this white supremacist teenager changed his outlook in life in one single night while writing an essay? The ending, too...while touching, it left me feeling cold overall. Nothing here was elaborated upon properly - we didn't see near enough of Derek's transformation to a new man in prison; just the bare minimum of it. There were less than 3 scenes with this Cameron character, who had been built up as quite important, and the whole party speeds by like a blur to the point where you wonder what just hit you. Give us more, dammit, this barely scrapes the surface of the potential this movie had. It tries to fool us by throwing in a lot of preaching and whatnot, but that won't fool me.Regardless, I did enjoy this quite a bit. American History X grabbed me by the throat and went full-throttle for damn near two hours. The characters are believable, and the plot is thick and quite juicy. It's a thoughtful, pensive film that will force you to really sink your teeth in and think; this isn't a summer blockbuster or a popcorn flick of any kind. For fans of intelligent, creative, introspective films, this is a winner, but be warned, it is not as good as people say. A rather tragic complex; a great film that just doesn't live up to expectations. The potential is there, though, and all in all this is an enjoyable film, so go get it if this sounds like your thing.",8,0,1,8 December 2007
Saw III," Weak and pretentious
","The first SAW film wasn't the best movie, and it had severe flaws in the directing, acting, and scriptwriting. But it's plot wasn't very derivative, although influenced by Se7en and other such thrillers. It was a pretty damn good plot line in a time when horror movies seemed to mean nothing else but crappy remakes of Japanese or Korean films with busty blonds and pale, anorexic little children possessed by evil spirits. It was a fun movie, with some good gore and some very interesting ideas, and was overall watchable if you turned off your critical brain for a few hours, an above average film overall. After months and months of critical acclaim and popularity that seemed to spread like a disease, we got the second SAW, which was mediocre at best, and then we got this the very next year. While initially appealing, SAW 3 sadly continues the downward spiral into mediocrity that had so plagued the second film after more than one viewing.What's wrong with it? I'd say it's just weak. The SAW movies may get brandied about on radio talk-shows and newspaper clippings as being the most extreme, outrageous, violent movies out there, but if you walked into this one looking for blood and guts, you'll be rather disappointed. This is actually the weakest of the three SAW films, not only in terms of quality, but also in terms of go-for-the-throat brutality and plot twists. Compared to the mad-carnival thrill ride of the first SAW (which only featured two men alone in a room, by the way), this film is positively neutered. Sure, it seems menacing at first, especially the fabled brain surgery scene, but once you're used to it, you realize just how blunt this beast's teeth are.My main example here is the 'games' featured here. The traps on display here are oddly restrained. The first movie featured an intriguing, spine-tingling trap involving a man who cut his wrists regularly, even though his life was perfectly fine. Our suicidal friend was locked in an iron cage, barbed wire criss-crossed over every bare inch of space inside it. To make it out alive, he'd have to cut himself again and again on the spiky barbs to reach the door, which would close forever once an hour was up. Compare this to the first (main) trap featured in SAW 3 - we have a naked woman tied to some poles above her in an ice-cold freezer, dangling there like a pendulum as our hero enters the frigid prison. His task is to...squeeze in between some bars and fetch a key behind them, ripping off some skin on his face as it touches the frozen bars. Excuse me, but I expected far, far more from a movie like this. You could tell me that the hooks trap from the beginning was good, and maybe it was, but it still doesn't hold a candle to the barbed wire stunt from the first movie either way, mainly serving as a poor ripoff of that one, if even that. It's pathetic, really, that all they could come up with here was either a boring rehash of an older trap, or a weak attempt at being 'lol wtf gross' (the pig guts trap - lame). The final trap - The Rack - is very good, on the contrary, boasting the dark, tortured genius that we all know the SAW films can pull off, and it's a shame they only really let loose for 5 or 10 minutes out of the whole movie.You could say that SAW 3 focuses more on the plot with Jeff and his crisis and all, but that's crap, these movies are torture horror films, and there's no point in watching them aside from seeing the cool traps and watching people die. They're like the cyber generation's Friday the 13th saga, as much as Leigh Whannel wants to jazz things up and make this movie seem better than it actually is, with the fancy Hollywood gloss and polished-to-the-brim special effects (that lose the charm and allure of the more savage, primal ones from the first movie, also). SAW 3 is far, far too pretentious and takes itself way too seriously. This is a neutered film that lacks the power and raw, unbridled anger and conviction of the first one, and it's a damn shame, although it was certainly bound to happen sooner or later.The plot is a bit of a departure from the more pugilistic and straightforward ones in the past two movies, and this time we get a much healthier and stronger dose of moral goodness stuffed down our collective throats. This kind of thing was always cheesy, but here it's taken to absurdly dizzying heights, and I can't even take it anymore. In the first two movies, we got some similar ideologies, but never were they as fleshed out as they are here, and never were they as cliché and boring as they are here. In traditional SAW fashion, though, the final 20 minutes of the film are quite gripping and endearing, and at least the ending of this one is far better than the ending to the previous sequel, and I doubt most people expected it to end this way. There are indeed good things to be found here, but the problem is that they're buried beneath a rather sterile, pre-processed horror movie, a film that relies too much on special effects and trying to gross us out. I did give it a 3/5, though, as this movie is still genuinely watchable and on-par. It's just a severe disappointment.",6,1,2,11 September 2007
Ocean's Eleven," Not the best movie I've ever seen
","This is okay, I guess. Not near as good as I hoped, but what ever really is? The plot is a bit flimsy, as is the lame, half-cocked romance between George Clooney and Julia Roberts, and definitely the underwhelming acting. Pitt and Clooney aren't given a lot to work with here, and most of the time it's all clichéd super-slick con artist posturing with little to no actual emotion or anything put into it. Seriously, this could be really good if our main characters had ever shown any emotion aside from the conniving smirks and poker faces they usually seemed to have on, but as it is, all I can say is that this is too generic and unmemorable to merit any of the praise it has been given.It does get some points for an entertaining climax and the well constructed heist, but that doesn't make a movie. Overall Ocean's 11 isn't something that will be remembered in years to come, so go see Casino instead.",7,1,2,2 March 2008
Batman Begins," The Rebirth.
","With this one Christopher Nolan rebirthed a legend, and it's head and shoulders above all the rest of the Batman movies and most superhero films I've seen in general. This is just a great film, with some dazzlingly dark graphics and well choreographed, if not rather choppy, action scenes that meld perfectly into the moody, shady Gotham City that Nolan has created. That's the best part about this new Batman series; the fact that Nolan has crafted the most perfect Batman setting and mood ever laid down to film thus far. Nothing else can touch this one right now.The only flaw in evidence is that sometimes the movie itself is as choppy and quick paced as the action scenes, and some of the dialogue feels forced, and Katie Holmes isn't that great, but who cares about that? Just see this.",9,2,2,23 August 2008
City of God," ...
","Well, I've been wanting to see this for a long time, and it did not disappoint - to put it lightly. Gritty, snappy, charismatic and even beautiful, this movie hits you, the viewer, in all the right places. Indeed, this is based on a real story, and it is also in Spanish with subtitles, but all that just serves to the purpose of assuring that City of God is as realistic and jarring as possible.This film doesn't sugar coat things and it doesn't make them out to be more gruesome than they actually are; it's just an extremely well written and performed film relying solely on the strength of the writing and the direction, and every single camera shot counts, with a good many of them that will remain in your head long after the credits roll. The acting, the dialogue, the pacing, the narration, it all just works so damned well that City of God ends up as one of the most memorable and affecting movies you'll ever see, sending you spiraling through a torrent of emotions that ultimately climaxes in one of triumph and closure. Forget all my usual banter about how you should see movies if you like good film-making, just see City of God before you die. Absolutely essential.",10,0,2,2 August 2008
The Number 23," Yep, this one misses the mark. Not that good.
","Here, folks, is Jim Carrey's newest movie. His career seems to be veering into darker territories again, like he did on 2004's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But this one crosses the line between morose and sad into actually frightening at times. It's too bad that this is such an underwhelming and generic movie, because Jim Carrey in a horror/thriller sounded like a cool idea. But while this movie is visually pleasing and good if you've never seen better ones, it's really not all that impressive stacked up to the bigger names of the genre. Sadly, the plot twists and turns here are rooted deeply in the likes of Fight Club and El Maquinista, to the point where I have to say that it'd be a better idea to watch those movies instead, and just skip this one entirely.I don't think Jim Carrey was fully ready to step over the line and into darker, more feral territory. This movie is dark, that's for sure, but it doesn't feel genuine or real. The darkness and morbid atmosphere at work here generally feels forced and contrived instead of actually working. El Maquinista went straight for the jugular with psychotic scares and twists, and that movie was naught but a Fight Club clone anyway, but it still made The Number 23 look like a timid child in comparison. They tried to be dark and morbid, but they slightly missed the mark here. Maybe next time?Shame, I wanted to like this movie so much, but it's just weak compared to it's influences. Jim Carrey and the other stars here bring up the score, as does the polished and quite well done directing and script, but I have to say that there are other movies that are far more deserving of your money.",6,0,1,14 July 2007
Ghost Rider," Horribly generic and clichéd
","(written March 2007)I'm starting to hate these comic book movies. The Spiderman movies were a burst of fun and had great actors, although they were pretty mediocre in the grand scheme of things. Fantastic Four played it safe and was pretty dull and unremarkable, but kinda fun all the same. And this one is just...cheesy as all get out, honestly. This is also the most cliché and deriative movie I've seen...ever, maybe, stealing just about every action cliché imaginable. But more on that in a little bit.So teenage motorcyclist Johnny Blaze made a deal with the devil to cure his father's cancer. The next day, his father is killed in a bizarre motorcycle accident, and the devil, Mephistophales, warns Johnny that he'll be back for him someday. Fastforward 15 years or so, and Johnny is on top of the world, a star motorcyclist who does the most dangerous stunts imaginable. By night, he studies religious texts alone in his living room, with books piled upon books, preparing for his 'sign.' One night, Mephistophales appears to Johnny again, telling him to go after Blackheart, his son, who is aiming to steal a scroll that contains the thousands of souls of the citizens of an old western town. When Johnny's high school sweetheart shows up again, things complicate...While this movie has some entertaining moments, such as Johnny's stunts on the freeway, it's mostly just dull and clichéd. It's also very cheap and even feels like some stupid 80s B flick at times, although it's supposed to be a world class Hollywood blockbuster. The CGI sucks, but then again, we can't really expect much else. This movie feels really shallow and modernized, too, very clichéd. The romance between Johnny and Roxanne is pretty stereotypical of these kinds of movies, and it feels like the directors just read Die Hard's script and the ones for a couple of 90s superhero cartoons and mashed the romance elements from those into this movie. The acting is nondescript at best, and the directing is pretty standard for these 'superhero' movies, but it seems to lack the epic, cinematic punch that Fantastic Four and Spiderman 2 had. I wish that was all that was wrong with this......but this is also the cheesiest chunk of lameness I've ever seen! Seriously, what is this? Just read some of the dialogue for this, especially from our villains, who are reduced to mere cartoon clichés due to their awful, awful lines. Ghost Rider's appearance and that flaming motorcycle are an example of cheese that works, because it's pretty cool sometimes, and in fact, most of what Ghost Rider says was acceptable to me, because I don't mind some cheese, and it's pretty cool. 'Your soul is stained with the blood of innocents...look into my eyes!' I can't help but find that cool. The villains are abysmal, though, especially Blackheart, who is meant to be scary and intimidating, but instead makes me snicker at how lame he really is. I didn't feel threatened by him at all through the movie, nor any of his henchmen. And Mephistophales has really bad lines too, not really appearing as evil or foreboding in the least.I mentioned before that this movie is extremely deriative and cliché of almost every other action/superhero movie out there, and it is. In the first 5 minutes of the movie, Johnny's father is killed, and he swears revenge, and then we see him as this take-no-prisoners, motorcycle-toting adult, who is apparently everyone's big hero now. His high school sweetheart shows up, and she's absolutely gorgeous now, with breasts the size of her head. And we have Johnny's best friend and sidekick, who serves no purpose except to be used as a scapegoat in the end of the film. We have the wise old mentor character, and an evil villain with an evil laugh and dark clothing. Couldn't this be a number of other movies? Can't they do better than this?! I can't really recommend this to anyone, unless you enjoy this much cheese. I have no problem with cheesiness, but this movie crosses the line into the boundaries of absolute lameness, and that's what I have a problem with. I also have a problem with how this movie has no original ideas at all, none. Zip. Nada. Nein. Zero. There are pros to this one, and it's not that terrible, but it's certainly a waste of time. If you want cheesy superhero movies, go rent Spiderman or it's sequel. If you want a good action movie, rent Die Hard. If you want something dark and vengeful, The Crow is a good pick. This one just fails.",2,0,1,16 June 2007
Stardust," Fluffy and a bit weak, but nice anyway
","This is fantasy taken to its happy, cheesy, corny, fluffy extreme, and I really should hate it a lot more then I do. Stardust is a ridiculously shallow and cheery film that isn't executed very well at all, yet it JUUUUUST manages to keep me from turning it off in disgust, with a pleasant storyline and good special effects to disguise its mediocrity. The characters are not really developed at all, remaining cardboard cutouts on a colorful backdrop - but at least they are cardboard cutouts that are pleasant to look at. The aesthetics here are top-notch, but they are disguising a flimsy, weak story that has been told many times before. This is a popcorn movie for families, not a movie for critics, so I'll give it an average score and not bother critiquing anything more. Recommended if this is your thing.",6,1,3,2 March 2008
I Am Legend," Yet another over-hyped piece of crap, but who expected anything better?
","Ho hum, what a boring movie. This may get a lot of press, but don't buy into that. It's a PG-13 film, so obviously you won't find anything risky or daring or even mildly exciting here. It doesn't leave much of an impression, and there is no reason to ever watch it more than once. It's all so calculated and fake, right down to the last detail, cleaned up for the kiddies and polished to an irritatingly artificial sheen. In the end, I Am Legend is so bland and pre-packaged that it should come with a Happy Meal.Not bad, but nowhere near good. Zombie survival horror for people who hate zombie survival horror. Blegh.",5,2,4,10 January 2008
The Illusionist," Fantastic.
","I knew this would be brilliant from the moment I heard of it, and lo, it is brilliant, no more or less than I had expected. It might not equal the unrivaled charisma and power of The Prestige, but The Illusionist is a brooding, sorrowful tale of magic, treachery and love in itself.Ed Norton does a typically excellent job, as do Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti, and the atmosphere is dark and, at times, unrelentingly aggressive and angry, despite the tragedy that seems to coat it all. The story pulls you in right from the start, and it doesn't let up for a good 2 hours or so, twisting and turning like an uncoiling serpent. Get this one if you like good cinema.",10,1,1,29 March 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Movie of the year.
","Yeah, yeah, the story of Brad Pitt aging backwards, how good could it be?Well, very good, apparently. This movie was just so long and detailed, sucking the viewer in immediately and keeping them hooked. It made you think, too. The whole concept of time and aging and the fact that nothing lasts forever was executed flawlessly. It was a look at life from a new perspective, full of all the beauty and the embarrassments and the trivial things and the quirks and everything else.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a riveting and intricate drama that will certainly remain enjoyable and powerful long after one viewing, and this is certainly one you'll want to go back and watch again. I haven't seen a movie this original and stirring in ages, and the way it takes a standard formula, a good old life story like you'd read in someone's autobiography, and creatively tweaks it with all the strange little nuances of Benjamin's curious condition is spellbinding. The combination of the surreal with the familiar, of the strange with the heartwarming and the personal, does exceptionally well, crafting an emotional behemoth of a movie that you need to see at any cost if you like good film making at all.I think I've found my movie of the year. See it. See it now.",10,1,3,30 December 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," It is something new in itself.
","Oh boy, did I ever hear a lot about this one. This is Quentin Tarantino's much lauded Kill Bill, and only the first part of a double feature at that!The fight scenes are spastic and energetic as hell, the homages are as quirky and silly as Tarantino's ever were (yet perfectly woven into a story that the actors put on with dead serious expressions) and the whole thing is as hyperactive as the Energizer Bunny on a Sunday, and while it feels incomplete due to ending right in the middle of the two-part story, it remains an extremely entertaining and unique thrill-ride through and through.",7,0,1,4 April 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," Surreal and entertaining.
","This is basically a movie about two robbers, their hostages and a host of drunken truckers and bikers fighting off vampiric strippers in Mexico. Sound good? OK, well, welcome to Robert Rodriguez' From Dusk Till Dawn, the only movie I've ever seen that has managed to so effectively make you afraid of mostly naked women. That has to be some kind of an accomplishment, and Quentin Tarantino is in this movie too - with a writing credit and a healthy post-Pulp Fiction sensibility to boot. That only adds to the surreality of the whole thing.So the movie pretty much jettisons along at rocket speed, with lots of silly moments and some really cool head explosions and gore later on when the slaying starts literally out of nowhere. Why are there vampires in Mexico? I don't know, all I know is that I'm not visiting any strip bars down there. This movie is worth watching though.",7,0,1,28 June 2009
The Dark Knight," The Highest Peak.
","Well, it's here, the movie of the summer and likely the movie of the year, too. Everyone had high hopes for The Dark Knight, and they were raised as new trailers were released and even moreso after Heath Ledger, our new Clown Prince of Crime, died, and the movie itself surpassed all of them.For one, let's talk about the movie as a whole. It's clear that Nolan and the main actors have all read their comics - Ledger apparently loves The Killing Joke - and done their homework, as on the prequel to this one, Batman Begins. What I love most about this is that it doesn't stray from the comics just to make the movie more watchable on screen, but rather to make the series fresh and innovative. Nolan takes the fabric of the Batman story and contorts it into something that it very well could have been if started in 2008 instead of 1940. Never does it feel forced or cheap, just...an alternative. A well made alternative at that.This is definitely a success as a comic book movie, but we also have an added dose of hyperactive, metal-spiked flaming tank ownage via Die Hard 3, vamping the levels of ass-kicking up about ten notches. Seriously, this just rules all the way through, with a polished sheen and a ton of edgy, super-memorable scenes that will keep you coming back again and again. There's a lot going on here, about three different subplots, and I definitely didn't catch everything on one viewing. But the speed is just another reason this is good, rather than a detractor, as in the first film. Everything is done a step up better than on the film's prequel, and that is how any sequel should be, but usually isn't.The acting is the other high point. I felt that the acting in Batman Begins was sometimes inadequate, but that has been fixed here. This is more relaxed, calculated and well performed, with sterling performances by Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart (honorable mentions for his excellent Two Face, nobody could have done it better!) and especially Heath Ledger. Ledger's Joker is indeed of the Killing Joke school, except he's even more dark and devious than he was in that novel. Every moment he's on screen he captivates, being the perfect counterbalance to Batman's rigid, often frightening justice stance. The 'disappearing pencil' trick, the 'Why so serious?' scene, and his final moments, laughing in the wind of the night...all masterful, completely superlative. Every inch of the praise upon him is worthy. Believe it.So basically this rules, see it instead of whatever other movie you were planning on seeing in 2008. The bar has been set high for a third installment to this series, and even if there isn't one, well, it's always better to go out on a high note. And that's what The Dark Knight is; a high note. My highest recommendation.",10,9,19,23 August 2008
Pulp Fiction," This will make you believe in God again
","WARNING: EXCESSIVE FANBOY REVIEWBrilliance comes in many shapes and forms. This is Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, widely and rightfully hailed as a masterpiece by several people, and I happen to be amongst them. Whoever they are, they have good taste.It's tough to say what is so great about this, because there's practically a grocery list of things to choose from. Its idiosyncrasies are bold and pronounced, yet weaved perfectly into a story that is both funny and charming, never becoming stale and never missing a beat. The repertoire of actors on display here is certainly of a high pedigree (Uma Thurman, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, etc.), and the way the stories are mixed and matched and jumbled up into the movie's steely exterior is done so masterfully that you don't even notice, blowing Crash and Memento (two films which I also lauded heavily, by the way) out of the water. Everything is perfectly in sync with the other stories and the way they come together is done so well that it gives me fits.I'd have to write a much longer review to detail every reason why this is so good, but that's unnecessary, and I'll keep it short: Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece, and as the credits roll, either your perception of films (and sometimes life in general) will have changed, or you will be lost forever. Absolutely essential.",10,1,2,17 May 2008
The Happening," Ain't no plot Happening here.
","Well, this sucks. M. Night Shyamalan is not a director I've been very familiar with over the years, having only seen his much-lauded and much-overrated The Sixth Sense, but he seems absurdly pretentious and smug. And all I have to say to that is, if this fecal matter is the best he can do these days, then he had better start learning some god damned humility.The Happening is another one of those fashionable natural disaster movie, only about ten times worse than you'd usually expect. This movie boasts deplorable writing, awful acting, plastic characters that try and fail to get you to care about them, and THE LAMEST DISEASE EVER. I won't spoil it for those of you who have not seen it yet, but this disease and the 'plot' constructed around it are absolutely laughable. It seems to be TRYING to build up, but it doesn't work, and mostly this just comes off as a bunch of suspenseful (haha) scenes strung together on a clothesline with no punch line or climax or anything of the sort. Oh, and why do all the characters in this movie have to say 'happening' so much? Annoying as Hell. This is basically a shitty 80s B movie with a modern sheen, and that is more horrifying than anything Shyamalan could conjure up in his writing.Oh, and have I mentioned how delightfully retarded this is? I mean, we have people talking to plants, the main character and his fiancée arguing about their petty problems in the middle of a train station where everyone is trying to escape the virus, and worst of all, the frighteningly dumb jab at the Americans with all of the references to 'terrorists.' Nice one, Shyamalan. All Americans are like that, indeed. F*ck you all the way to the bank.So basically, all the viewer can really do, deprived of any visible plot or hook to grab onto, is sit in awe of the puerile dialogue and attempts at characterization, which are so bad they're funny, and I actually found myself laughing at this more than real comedies like Death to Smoochy and Tropic Thunder, which leaves something to be said for those, as well. I'll chuck a few points onto the rating here, as it did make me laugh a few times, but really, The Happening is an awful movie and I would not recommend it.",3,2,5,5 December 2008
The Fountain," Beautiful and probably one of the best movies of the century
","...and here I shall attempt to review what will one day be a classic in the hopefully near future. The Fountain is many things. It's a touching film. It's not long, though, clocking in at around 80 or 90 minutes, but it does manage to pack in enough emotion to out-do every single lame, candy-assed Hollywood romance ever created, or almost. More movies should cut down their running times like this; because there is not a wasted moment in The Fountain from start to finish, despite the movie still moving at an gregariously slow pace. You won't find any blitzed, seizure-inducing cut-and-paste editing scenes here, and there are no epic explosions and battle scenes either. What you will find, though, is an entire treasure trove of realistic passion and jaw-dropping emotion, and that's the strong point of this movie. Nothing here feels contrived or derivative or fake at all - this is a story of a woman with a lot of love in her heart and a passion for life in general, and a man who would do anything to preserve the same love for all eternity. That's the Fountain.The Fountain is a simple movie. While at first it's repertoire of lazily abstract images and slow plot construction may seem intimidating and might even turn off the average moviegoer, a deeper voyage into The Fountain's layers reveals something not hard to comprehend at all. I mean, honestly, this film is a love story at it's core, there are no mind-bending plot twists and secret meanings. It's just a passionate, intricately woven romance about how far a man would go to let his love live on forever. If you're looking for super slick plot twists and drama, then look elsewhere, because The Fountain is not your typical modern flick at all. As I said, average moviegoers probably won't be able to get into this one. It's just too abstract and weird, and I won't blame anyone for disliking it on the basis of it's obvious inaccessibility. But regardless, the shimmering majesty of this movie is evident to those who are willing to try and find it. It's clear after the film sinks in - The Fountain is a straightforward and simple film disguised by multiple layers of artistic refinement and glorious imagery. Oh, it's not all clear cut for you, there is one other sticky point for some people - the fact that The Fountain takes place in three different time-spans all at once, weaving them together into a rich, complex tapestry of master-class storytelling. Yet somehow, despite the winding complexity of it all, The Fountain remains a pretty basic story once you get your head around it's eccentricities. Simplicity and complexity go hand in hand here to create a plethora of beauty and sorrow, a perfect oxymoron.There's a very deep, broad contrast between the beautiful simplicity of the film's plot line and the absolutely jaw-dropping grandeur of the special effects and graphics utilized here. The directing here is through the roof, and the cinematography on display here is probably amongst the five or six best from any movie I've ever seen, if not the very top of the goddamn list. Just watch the last few minutes of the movie, and you'll understand. One of the things I really love about The Fountain is that it's beautiful and touching without trying to be anything it isn't. It's an honest film, and it does everything it wants to do effortlessly and flawlessly, with graceful, sweeping movements that etch a stunning caricature of rich, luscious aesthetics into an otherwise simple story. Marvelous.",10,148,187,4 October 2007
There Will Be Blood," Masterful.
","I don't know whether this is quite as good as No Country for Old Men or not - only time will tell that - but this is a very, very good film in its own right, anyway. This is most comparable to Citizen Kane, boasting a similar structure and main character, although this is every bit as compelling and interesting, with twists and turns around every corner, always something to keep you on the edge of your seat. There Will Be Blood is a riveting drama, and it weaves a tale that you will not forget.Daniel Day Lewis's acting is fantastic, and he is surrounded by a supporting cast that do not lack for acting prowess themselves. If you enjoy masterful cinema, than this is as good of a place to look as No Country, and better than most other movies you could pick. Superb.",10,6,10,18 May 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," 'Are you relieved to know that you're not a golem?'
","Of all the things I hold dear. Stranger Than Fiction may be different from my normal intake of high octane thrillers and intellectual opii, but it is no less glorious than an evening sunset with a voluptuous lover. Breaking from the normal 'romantic comedy/drama' mold, it uses subtle irony and a huge left-hook plot twist at the end to create what is possibly one of the best films of 2006, truly a stunning accomplishment considering how many other noteworthy films came out around then.Stranger Than Fiction is a pure 'feel good' film, making anyone who's capable of smiling break into a big, wide grin by the rolling credits, with side-splitting laughs and silly nuances around every corner, and yet it never slips into cheapness or slapstick. There is much more here than a simple comedy. Stranger Than Fiction is intricately layered with dramatic tones and a few rose-tinted romantic scenes, and the whole thing is a boiling cauldron pot of influences, creating a positively shimmering mixture that will never grow old or stagnant, a story that will keep your mind entertained and your heart warmed and softened. And the irony I mentioned? Brilliantly executed, all the way through. It is a story within a story, and even when you already know what's going to happen next, the film will keep you all smiles. How can anyone say no to that glorious ending? Stranger Than Fiction rises above such paltry number ratings, so heed no attention to the perfect score - just check it out now.",10,1,2,18 May 2008
Scream," We have us a conundrum here!
","It's a wonder what going into a movie with no expectations will do for you. This is the much lauded Scream, the so-called 'smash hit that transformed horror into a phenomenon' (an obvious lie, but whatever), and I don't think it's half bad at all. This is of course, ridiculously deplorable and deporably ridiculous, but it knows it is, and it is very, very entertaining while being such.Scream takes its cues from Halloween, Friday the 13th and its three sequels, and it doesn't hide that fact, even playing Halloween on screen in the movie - allowing for a rather humorous twist towards the end, heh. This pretty much follows the blueprint of all the cheesy 80s splatter/serial killer movies there ever were, but it doesn't screw up.There's little here that you haven't seen already if you love these dumb 80s slashers, but if that is the case, then what's one more to add to the pile? Scream may be stupid, but it isn't a bad movie at all. Recommended.",8,0,0,15 March 2008
Halloween," This is what fear is---this movie has no equal
","What is there to really say? This is a classic by all means and it hasn't truly found an equal in the slasher genre since. While Friday the 13th had a 'party' vibe to it, and Nightmare on Elm Street was over the top and filled with crazy gore and violence effects. This one was different...quieter, subtle, more mature and scary then either of the aforementioned films.It had very little gore or nudity, and yet it was more of a horror movie then Friday the 13th and all of that film's clones ever was. It was scary because of the realism, the fact that this stalker was roaming a quiet suburban neighborhood and entering dark houses and killing people. It was scary because HE HAD NO MOTIVE. That's why this film trumps all of it's mediocre sequels, because Michael Myers didn't even have a name yet, and he was just some creepy stalker going around murdering teenagers in the dead of night on Halloween. You'll be looking over your shoulder for a while after the credits roll for this one.Acting is good, especially by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Even the supporting cast and the children did good jobs, odd for a slasher film like this. But this isn't a normal slasher film, again, this is something else. The slow, menacing directing that plunged you into darkness and fear at every twist and turn, splicing your heart with true horror, and that dark, grainy picture quality...this is just amazing. Most horror movies today barely muster a scream or a shudder. You hear me, Boogeyman? The Messengers? Ring Two? This is a horror movie. This is what fear means. And this is far scarier then anything you can think of in the last 10 years. Bah to modern horror, this is where it's at if you're just starting out in the genre.There is really not much you can detract for this film except for the shoddy picture quality, especially at the beginning of the movie. Very dark and grainy, you can't see anything except for Donald Pleasance's face and his assistant. But it gets better later on, when we're out of such a dark and dank setting. This was 1978 though. So Halloween is excused in this department.Halloween is a timeless horror classic, and defies any stereotypes of the genre being 'brainless', 'just about gore', or 'pointless.' This is essential, and everyone needs to see it once in their lifetime. Highly, highly recommended.",10,4,5,17 June 2007
1408," Delightfully surreal and visually insane
","I expected pretty much nothing from this movie. Stephen King's book-to-movie adaptions have been hit (The Shining, Dreamcatcher) or miss (IT, Riding the Bullet) with me, and 1408 was never really my favorite story of his anyway. It was an eccentric, showy little tale that seemed to thrive on cheap thrills and insane, mind-boggling visuals rather than subtle horror, but it was fun for what it was. This movie is probably better than the story by a small margin, which is surprising. The reason for this is simple: Content. Being such a short story with characters that were not so fleshed out, Mikael Håfström had his work cut out for him making it into a full-fledged film. So he added some much-needed depth to it, giving Enslin a daughter and a wife, and adding some genuine tragedy to what would normally be a one-trick pony of a horror flick. The best scene in the entire movie was not even a part of the story (the scene where Cusack is holding his daughter, and she dies in his arms) which shows how well this one can stand on it's own.Aside from that, the acting is all done extremely well, with John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson giving outstanding performances, and all of the supporting cast doing a great job as well. The directing is great, too, with the special effects and visuals clashing with the extended plot-line for the front of the stage. The tidal wave scene is especially cool, as are all the little scares you get in between the beginning and the end. The melting phone, the never-ending wall, the air duct, the ax-wielding ghosts...and of course the inevitable daughter scene. Everything is just so damn over the top and tremendous that it seems like some sort of parody of the more subtle and dark 'haunted house' films, but it's not---this is just the refinement of the old style, and a more laid back one at that. Not nearly as serious as something like Amityville all the time, and it works surprisingly.Speaking of the scares, that's another surprise. This movie is actually pretty creepy. You won't want to stay in any hotel rooms for a while after this. While similar to Psycho and The Shining in the setting, this one is definitely more spastic and insane in all departments, and watching it with the lights off will no doubt yield amplified scares. It veers back and forth in a half-crazy lurch, and you're left questioning your sanity as you watch poor Cusack struggling to keep up with this 'evil f***ing room.' This isn't a film that moves at a slow pace. It goes for the throat, and succeeds, taking you by the jugular for almost two hours and never once letting up. This is one of the most effective horror stories I've seen since Into the Mouth of Madness in terms of scares. In fact, this film reminds me a lot of that one. When they end, you're left dazed and confused, wondering what the hell you just saw. An admirable quality.If there was one thing I had to pick at, it'd be how the new plot elements with Cusack's deceased daughter don't always quite blend as well as they want to with the actual story of 1408. It's a bit schizophrenic. One minute it's telling you an over the top and spastic ghost story, and pleasing you with it's crazy visuals, but the next, you're made to feel sorry for Cusack, and your spine is chilled by his agonized cries as his daughter turns to dust in his arms. And then it goes back to more of the same crazy, upbeat scares that you loved so much. It's not bad, and it still works, but I was left feeling slightly disjointed after it was all done. The ending was very good though, and this movie is a satisfying, aesthetically-pleasing cornucopia of horror, amusement park-esquire thrills, and even a bit of tragedy that you shouldn't miss. Highly recommended.",9,11,19,30 June 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the landmarks of the thriller genre.
","Everyone knows this one; it's a pop culture gem and an icon in the realm of detective/thriller movies. Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lector, an unstoppable pairing and a pleasure to watch - Anthony Hopkins' performance is amazing, and Jodie Foster is always smart, snappy and cute as hell. The supporting actors are okay, sometimes becoming a little hammy or whatever, but never distracting from the film.I think the main selling point of this is Hannibal himself, whose psychological musings and mind games make this movie stand out from others of its kind. Just take a look at his talks with Clarice Starling in the mental asylum - that is chilling. The other inmates are kind of creepy, but they're more silly than anything, and are overshadowed by Lecter himself. The dialogue in these scenes is just great, worth the whole price of admission by itself.The movie flows well, wasting no time and generally being solid in every area, albeit not truly astounding in any of them, either. The story is basically as solid a detective story as you'll get, with every scene making you wonder what is about to happen next. Perhaps the most exciting part of the movie has nothing at all to do with the whole serial killer deal, as it is when Hannibal escapes from prison. You have to see it to find out what I mean - it is truly electrifying and suspenseful.If you haven't seen this yet, you should rectify that immediately. This is a definite genre classic and certainly one any self-acclaimed movie buff needs to see. Recommended.",8,0,1,26 August 2009
Identity," Overrated and pointless; skip this one
","Is this real? I mean, it's a pretty hokey film. I didn't even know they made stuff like this. Starts off alright, then becomes really great, and then tapers off with a really ridiculous plot twist. Really, this was a perfectly good crime thriller until they introduce the twist, and then it all starts to slowly fall apart. Maybe to some people it seems fine, but I don't like it at all. It feels like the retarded little brother of Memento and The Machinist, trying to be those films, yet coming out just slightly skewed. And under all of that gloss, it's just a slasher film, a Friday the 13th write off. Really doesn't look too good to write about this one on paper, rather than watching it. This movie feels very fake and artificial by the end, an attribute to which the plot twist does NOT help in the least, and it really unravels down to the bare bones of it's mediocrity with the absolutely horrible ending.But this film isn't without moments, for it's rather enjoyable for the bulk of it's duration. Before the plot twist, you're really fired up and enjoying this one. I know I was. The interactions between characters and all of the kills are pretty enjoyable, but, it just keeps coming back to how bad it gets in the last 15 minutes or so. Not recommended to fans of serious movies.",4,3,7,16 June 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Exactly what we expected, and nothing more or less
","Die Hard. The name that comes to mind whenever you think of a stereotypical action film. The original Die Hard became extremely influential almost 20 years ago upon it's first release, and now, 19 years later, the fourth sequel of the series has finally come upon us. While people were skeptical as to whether or not they could match the greatness of the original trilogy after such a long break (the 3rd was released 12 years ago), and while they grew even more skeptical upon learning that the film was PG-13, I daresay that Live Free or Die Hard definitely lives up to the franchise name.This is a Die Hard for a new generation, and I kinda like that aspect of it. While the elements of the classic films are there, this time it's given an upgrade, with lots of the technological exploits that plague other modern action films, and a much sleeker, cooler feel. The fights are just as wild and crazy as ever, Bruce Willis has not lost an ounce of his charismatic action-hero energy, and the performances all around are good overall. The directing is good, and the special effects are definitely something to be praised, with explosions all around. In this movie, everything blows up. My one criticism is how Timothy Olyphant makes a pretty lame villain, and he dies way too fast. Most of his henchmen put up much more of a fight than he did. Just a minor quip, though.While they may have lost the genuine '80s/90s gritty action flick' feel with this one, it's still incredibly badass, and something to see if you're an action movie fan. This one destroys Paycheck, Thoughtcrimes, Wake of Death, and every other mediocre action/thriller movie in the past couple of years. Recommended.",9,0,1,4 July 2007
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Funny and original.
","Here's one that most people seem to love unconditionally, and I can see why. It loosely makes fun of movies like Back to the Future and other 80s movies with its silly characters and obsession with rock music, the settings are cool, the plot is...creative, and most of all...THE HISTORICAL FIGURES! Best part of the movie, seriously. All of them were insanely enjoyable (so much that you forget that Bill and Ted themselves are so boring most of the time). Joan of Arc was a cutie, Abe was damn cool, Genghis Khan, Freud, Beethoven, Socrates and Napoleon were all hilarious and the whole package makes for a hilarious joy ride that you will never forget.With that said, most of the writing in this is pretty damn bad, and George Carlin stands out, as much as I hate to say this, as an exceptionally lackluster actor, with his ending monologue being perhaps the most cringe-worthy scene, right next to the beginning of the 'Wild West' segment for pure inanity.Still, good stuff, very fun and silly. Recommended.",7,0,0,30 December 2008
Casino," Flashy lights, green grass and red blood.
","After the great Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese released Casino, a very similar movie with a few of the same actors, and I think I actually prefer this one to its predecessor, by a small margin. Casino is embellished with a lot of flashy overhead shots of nighttime Las Vegas, but underneath all that, you'll find a compelling and gritty drama full of great characters, a complex and winding plot that will have you stuck to your seat for the full three hours - not an easy feat, I might add - with multiple subplots that all remain interesting. They intertwine and twist into the great drama that is the individual man's life, and there are countless scenes here that will remain memorable: the introduction of each major character, Joe Pesci interacting with his young son, Sharon Stone interacting with her leeching ex-boyfriend, the scene where Robert DeNiro stands in the desert as the dust from Pesci's car kicks up around him, and the countless scenes of upper-class suburban Los Vegas juxtaposed with the chaotic, grimy personal lives of those who inhabit it.This movie is pretty long, so if you are not the type who likes to sit down for three straight hours, then I wouldn't recommend this one to you, but for everyone else, feast away. Martin Scorsese's Casino is always realistic, stirring and memorable, so go see it if you haven't already. Superlative.",10,1,1,2 January 2009
300," Pretty lame.
","Never in my life have I seen a movie as blatantly and tremendously overrated as this one is. And it's an even worse crime when such a hyped up movie sucks so much. There is a whole lot of praise heaped upon this one, and I suppose I'd describe the phenomenon as 'low standards.' People like this because they haven't seen anything better, and it's a crying shame, no sarcasm there. I've heard this movie called badass, which is a blatant lie, unless your definition of badass includes such fitting adjectives as 'slow' and 'boring.' None of the much-lauded fight scenes here are stirring or bloody or exciting in the least, so you can just forget that.People always say that you should watch flicks like this not expecting anything other than a good time, but I never expected anything other than that, and I still walked away disgusted. It fails even at being a dumb action movie, because this is just too dragging and dull and sappy for that. 300 is a lame, pre-processed piece of crap that the mainstream masses will eat up, but anyone who enjoys good cinema can safely avoid it. Plodding, weak and overall a waste of time. Truly awful.",3,0,0,4 October 2007
Cube," Nail biting suspense and a lot of fun.
","This is the movie that pretty much started the whole SAW thing, along with David Fincher's Se7en, so you might be inclined to hate it for that, but it's just too good to argue with. First, the bad: I thought this movie dawdled a little too much on time-passing sequences in which nothing happened, which could have easily been filled up with more of the edgy and dark character-driven tension the rest of the movie so thrived on. A few things seemed a little too convenient, too, like the retarded guy knowing how to square numbers or whatever (this is partially explained by Cube Zero, but that's no excuse; it was poorly written). And I did not think Quentin's character was as believable as it could have been - he switched moods a little too fast.However, everything else about this just rules. It isn't an amazing film, but it is really good, with the acting being surprisingly good (especially compared to Cube Zero) and the drama and tension being extremely well executed. The characters were given distinctive and interesting personalities and were only detailed enough for the story to work. The traps and the gore are well done, as they are not the focal point of the story and don't need to be - we're scared more by what's outside the cube instead of inside it! So this is a great film, immensely entertaining and always keeping you on the edge of your seat, certainly worth watching for fans of horror, science fiction or just gripping, nail-biting suspense in general. Get it now.",8,0,1,31 July 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Shining majesty in film form.
","Winning Oscars is apparently easy for heartwarming romance/slice-of-life stories. But that's not to say Slumdog Millionaire doesn't deserve it, even if I think Benjamin Button should have gotten it instead. This movie is a very eloquent, artistic and cinematic venture that honestly left a smile on my face. Sure, it's a bit hammy and heavy-handed, but it works, and the story is told masterfully. There are some really tense dramatic moments here, and the movie being two hours long only feels like about ninety minutes - it flows wonderfully. The acting is great, even from the children, pulling you right in and keeping you there. And Freida Pinto is hot - even though she doesn't look a damn thing like the child version of her character. The only thing I did find a bit unbelievable was how every question Jamal was asked tied into his past and childhood somehow. I guess it's kind of realistic, because that's just how we learn things, but it's still a bit odd that every single question would tie in so snugly. Oh well. So Slumdog is a really good movie that I feel deserved the Oscar at the end of the day. It isn't really perfect, and I liked a few films from 2008 better, but am I going to complain when a film this good is getting such widespread praise? Hell no.",9,0,7,26 August 2009
V for Vendetta," Solid, if watered down.
","After reading the long, bleak and layered graphic novel, I wasn't sure what I would think of the movie, but it turns out that this isn't that bad at all, being quite enjoyable and kick-ass flick that retains most of the dark and romantic atmosphere of the book. Now, it is quite modernized and Hollywood-ized, so don't expect exactly the same level of sophistication - it does take a few scenes to get used to seeing V, as he does naturally come off as silly on the big screen as compared to his pen-and-inked literary counterpart, but overall it isn't badly done at all. Hugo Weaving does quite an admirable job, too, pulling off the mood of the character perfectly.I think what I like about this movie is that it manages to not completely suck despite simplifying the original story for theater audiences and adding a gamut of Hollywood action scenes. I mean, everything we loved from the comic is still here. All of the powerful scenes are still at least 95% intact, and while I'm sure it could have been done better, V For Vendetta is a satisfying and thoroughly invigorating film that will not disappoint anyone looking for a quality book-to-movie transition. It's got good acting, some stunning visual hooks and a plot that you will dig right from the start as 'the voice of Fate' comments on the state of a war torn world. Go get this one if you haven't seen it already.",8,1,4,22 November 2008
