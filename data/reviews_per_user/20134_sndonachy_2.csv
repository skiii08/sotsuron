Casablanca," great classic but somewhat boring....still a must see
",this is a great film if you put it down on paper but i couldn't help notice that it was just a little too long but i guess i think that just because i'm from a completely different generation. still I thought the story could not have been better. Hollywood does owe a lot from this film and it is Boigie at his finest ahead of its time. if you are a movie lover or an inspiring director/writer this is a great way to make a film. this movie in my opoion was THE classic and started the meaning of the word. if you are into action movies of now a days then I don't recommend this but if you into seeing movies at there finest this is a must see.,7,0,6,21 May 2009
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Laugh Hard!!!
","Finally!!!!!!! a good movie from apatrow!!!! when I saw superbad, step brothers and pineapple express i thought man this guy is not funny at all. then I realized that it was seth rogan not judd apatrow writing the movies. so when I heard about this movie and saw it wasn't written by seth rogan I thought that I would give it a try. and thank god I did. this movie made me laugh so hard I nearly cried though it does have mixed reviews if you are a fan of older styles of comedy (like mel brooks) or of rock and roll movies then I recommend you see this movie. two thumbs up. now i realized that judd apatrow is a genius. and that fat no talent assclown seth rogan. is giving him a bad name.(though the 40 year old virgin was OK)",10,1,1,20 May 2009
