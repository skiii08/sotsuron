Moneyball," Good but very cerebral
","I have heard it said that the most nerdy sport of all is baseball. I believe that to be true. If a math major is going to be interested in a game, the usual choice is baseball.It is a statistician's delight. Hockey (by comparison) has only a few well known stats and few are published routinely. Hockey might be more exciting to watch, but baseball is a much tenser spectator experience. Will the pitcher out maneuver the batter or will the batter dominate the pitcher? The question hangs in the air as the pitcher absent mindedly scuffs the rubber on the mound and the batter takes a practice swing and sets his stance. Who wins, what are the odds, what history do these two have, how hot is the day, which way is the wind going, who's in a slump, who's not, who can throw nothing but blinding fastballs, who has a slider that looks like it can be hit into the parking lot of Yankee stadium until it winds up in the catcher's mitt? And as the seconds drag on, all these questions are discussed between people who may never meet again.But these statistics are kindergarten level questions when Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) opens up his computer and starts really classifying data, using factorials, permutations, combinations and z scores and goodness knows what other statistical mysteries known only to the nerdiest of nerds.Peter is the obvious genius, but there is someone else in the movie who is unusual. His skill certainly ranks above talent. He is driven primarily, it seems, by working a new angle in Baseball, an angle that he himself has no idea where to begin looking. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) knows the answer is somewhere, but he does not know where. There has to be some way to replace the individual 'hero' of baseball. If you loose someone like (say) Mickey Mantle in your line up, do you look for another Mantle or do you seek a collection of players that individually come no where near Mantle's skill and ability but as a collection of players who can add up to Mantle? Do you go for the individual or the group? Prior to Beane the answer was the Yankee model. You go for a Dimaggio to replace Ruth and Gehrig and a Mantle for a Dimaggio.Beane changed all that when he looked for a group that could somehow work together and together do what looked like it was an impossibility: put together a winning team that was made entirely of average (affordable) players that collectively could deliver an amazing result, an unexpected one, one that would grab the imagination of a fan base that could not believe the results until records that had stood for years were broken. Day after day the fans were treated to a lengthening of the consecutive wins record. It gave them heart and it gave them courage.The movie does the same thing. It is all metaphor for collective cooperation rather than individual heroics. We see a man who recognized the gift of someone else and was not at all threatened by it. The two central characters work with each other, each understanding what the other knew and each deeply respecting it.I took off 2 points for the music at the end. I cannot imagine why the director used it. Nothing justifies it.",8,2,4,18 December 2011
Inglourious Basterds," 1 awful
","I seldom review films I detest.This one is below detest. Six million people were ruthlessly hunted down and murdered during the Second World War. In all, 22 million people lost their lives.Those statistics are not to be treated with anything but horror. Nazi Germany was a mad house. It was ruled by sociopaths and psychopaths. It was a carefully planed mass murder.To be treated as this movie has is a travesty and degradation to those innocents who lost their lives.I cannot give a reason that satisfies me of why the film was made. I don't have any idea what it hopes to accomplish. Further, I have nothing to say about the nature of the acting styles, the plot holes, the absolute impossibility of it happening. I do not see any irony. I don't see any social comment.And though in general, the acting was good and the technicals good, that only means that the hollow nature of the plot betrays whatever technical values there are.I promised I would use spoilers. The whole movie was a spoiler. Any reference to the plot would be a spoiler. My opinion of it is a warning: don't see this film. There is nothing in it that redeems it. It was a complete waste of talent, time and money. I suppose the 1 out of 10 is for the cast and editing but the sum total of the parts is really zero.",1,2,8,27 July 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," 20 dollars to watch special effects from a video game
","20 dollars to watch the special effects of a level below that of a video game. At least with a video game a player has the ability to interact. Not so with this movie. I would have given this a zero, but it is impossible.This had no plot that could be followed. It had no characters that would interest anyone with an IQ over 45. It had no theme that I was aware of. It had no suspense because this is a prequel, so we know all the good guys will be around for yet another disaster movie, and so will the one good actor -- the bad guy Khan. It had music that was overpowering as though it should add to all the cacophony of what passed for dialogue. It had no wit and no charm and no depth.In short it had nothing at all and if that's all Star Trek can do, it's time for another series. Let this one rest. It has been an honourable series up to this point.Leave it be.",1,124,204,17 May 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Not Citzen Kane but a thoughtful unexpectedly good movie
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is a movie about 3 couples and 2 educations. It is not an ordinary comedy because people are allowed to say and do things which reflects our times and our society more than it does the wishes and dreams of a segment of our society.Couple Number One ================= Cal Weaver (Steve Carell) and Emily Weaver (Juliette Moore) are out celebrating when he asks her what she would like (thinking the answer might be something like pumpkin pie) when she announces she wants a divorce. That's quite an opening line for a 'comedy.' Because he loves her, he immediately though very reluctantly agrees. He's read all the modern truisms about separation 'If you love someone let them go.' So he lets her go. All very cold and civilized. But he doesn't respond that way; he's not civilized at all.Reliable straight arrow Cal has a response that his 13 year old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) would understand perfectly. He goes to a bar, drinks too much, and announces to the people in the bar just how sad, hurt, unaccepting he really is. He lives the 21st century but he feels the 1950's. The Educations ============= The education is in two parts. There is Cal's education and then there is Jacob's (delightfully filled out by Ryan Gosling – a terrific actor who can do just about anything). The first one is easy. It is all fantasy. Jacob convinces Cal that there is a method to dealing with women: Right clothes, right lines, right attitude and right tone of voice; that's all it takes. Jacob is shallow, and who knows but his shallow methods might work on a certain type of woman. Cal sees it works like Alternate Medicine. People around you say one thing and Dr. Jacob another. Who's to say Jacob isn't right? So Cal is a good student. He goes from an uncertain bubbling incompetent to a clone almost as good as Jacob himself. In one of the minor sub plots, he seduces Marisa Tomei who plays her absolute best over the top recovering alcoholic who has bought into our view that sex is therapy. That is the height of Cal's career as 21st century lounge lizard. It also is a wake up call for him. He knows how shallow all of this is.The second education is that of Jacob, who discovers that for all her brilliance, Hannah, (Cal's oldest daughter played by Emma Stone) is grounded in something far better than meaningless sex. She believes in love and though she is distracted by her reaction to the cold stupidity of a coworker, she is not so blinded that she can't see where Jacob will lead her even though she thinks that's what she wants. Hannah demands underneath that frustration, that Jacob do more than get her fixed. Perhaps because some of Cal's virtue rubs off on him, Jacob realizes he must comply with her values.The Second Couple ================= This is really intended as either comedy relief or a spoof on the 'Nerd' movies. It is the puppy love of a thirteen year old (Jonah Bobo who plays Robbie Weaver) and his baby sitter (Jessica startlingly well done by Analeigh Tipton). It is a real over the top presentation, but its not unrealistic. It is the way a young teen would act, if not over someone then something. There is commitment, there is enthusiasm, there is desire, there is single mindedness, there is the willingness to do anything it takes to succeed. And there is wisdom. He is smart enough and practical enough that Cal (who both loves and admires Robbie – a rare combination) admits out loud that sometimes Robbie scares him.In the meantime Jessica is in love with Cal. She's older but really just as inexperienced as Robbie. In our century sex knows no real boundaries (it's love that's the problem), and she's willing to take the advice of a much more knowledgeable 'older' woman – a classmate that knows how to deal with 'older men.' Jessica accepts the advice and does what she is told. The trouble is that she cannot get up the nerve to give what she does to Cal and her parents discover it. That's when parental love comes in contract with sexual ease. Hell hath no fury like an inflamed parent.Robbie, faithful and very truthful observer that he is, gives up on her. How can he compete when a woman does not recognize him to be on the same playing field? We have just killed the 1930's and 40's notion of one girl many beaus.The Least Convincing Couple =========================== I was least convinced by Emily and Kevin Bacon. Of all the people in this movie, she learned the least. Once she was convinced how much Cal had learned, how he could cope and how much he was dedicated to the idea of her, she wanted him back. She's Harlequin at its best. What this movie did =================== The director and actors rejected any notion of anything less than a good strong marriage. With all its troubles and disadvantages it is still our best option. This movie makes any of us who are in committed marriages very uncomfortable because it is bleak and at the same time rich, powerful and yet people get to snivel, it knows its society, yet it dares to choose a value as old as the beginning chapters of Genesis. It shows our vulgarity, but chooses modesty. Like it or hate it, Crazy, Stupid Love at least has the courage to stand for something that is critical of our revolving divorce door and shallow discontent.",8,0,1,19 November 2011
The Best Years of Our Lives," A Great Film
","The Best Years of Our Life is often compared to It's a Wonderful Life. They never should be. Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. (How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with.) Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just, especially the ones that have been fought recently.I have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington, which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi, Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience, moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.I cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.No one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy, Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war, because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others: ultimately no one could help.The moving part of the film (this could be the beginning part of the spoiler) is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate, do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit, Harold listens.The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife  standard fair for 30's/40's films. Derry did not debate the point: he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him, Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation: they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped, stacked, stored, discarded and soon to be recycled: their function, worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does, making him fit, in his mind, for the woman he loves.I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege.",10,13,15,18 December 2005
Tangled," Fun
","Children's movies tend to have character's that are not very dimensional -- like UP (absenting the first scene which shows how a lifetime of unexpected events often limits our dreams).The best of children's films subtly presents more interesting characters that have more that just 1 set of characteristics. Such a film was Tangled.Rapunzel is astonishing feminine when she cajoles Maximus (the horse) into accepting Flynn Rider as her protector/guide as she makes her way to the festival of the lanterns. She really turns 'it' on. No guy could resist her combination of innocence and womanliness.My wife made mention of Flynn Rider before anything else. 'Now there is a man,' was her brief summary of what she liked about the film. He only appeared as superficially very charming to me. Then I saw her point. He does bear a resemblance to Errol Flynn, who was not only charming, but courageous. He treated everything, good and bad, with a basic delight in life.It is the horse that is perhaps the most fun in this film. He had absolutely no dialogue whatever, but he understood everything that was said to him. He had a face that was plastic in origin and conveyed all of his responses with facial expressions. Children's films are masters of speechless communication. The Little Mermaid is almost a perfect example of this genre. So towards the end of her negotiations with him, Maximus lowers his head, flattens his ears and closes his eyes. He knows that his honour as a protector of the realm has been challenged. He knows that she is playing the damsel in distress routine and doing it very well. He knows that she is making a request he cannot refuse. He gives in, but it is certainly against his better judgement. So he shakes hands/hooves with Flynn. He has given his word and he will be obedient to that oath. But he doesn't have to like it.To emphasize the point, he and Flynn exchange shoves and punches on the bridge. They act like a couple of seven year olds. One has to be delighted by such an exchange.The last of the good guys is Pascal, the mood ring with a tail. He is, I think, a chameleon. He too is wordless, but he is not nearly as well developed as Maximus.The men at the inn look like they should be bad guys, but they are not. True, they are capable of drawing swords and maybe using them, but they all have a dream and again it is Rapunzel's innocence that they respond to. Each of them reveals in song what they dream of doing should they be free of their image. They like Rapunzel, but they are not sure of Flynn.The one really 'bad' guy is Mother Gruthel -- wonderfully voiced by Donna Murphy. She also has the one song that is memorable (Mother Knows Best). She is all oil and false charm and an imitation of motherly love on the outside and all ooze and darkness on the inside. She is a frightening creation.So there's your cast. It's a delightful movie. You don't have to go see this with a kid as your excuse. Just go see it. It's fun for everyone.",10,8,14,2 June 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Eastwood
","Spoiler for Million Dollar Baby. I am an Eastwood Fan.I think he's a terrific director. Even his minor films are above most other directors.I don't think you can properly review this film without considering Million Dollar Baby. Eastwood and Morgan Freeman dominated that film, but the actual emotional star was Hilary Swank who won an Academy Award for her performance.Eastwood works well with women, no question about that. Even at his age, there is something magnetic about the way any woman and Clint Eastwood interact on the screen. In Million Dollar Baby, his tough exterior covered a marshmallow interior. Hilary Swank's character caught on quite quickly and Morgan Freeman always knew it. When asked to help her commit suicide, it was only his love for her that allowed him to do it. She was the daughter that should have been answering all his letters. All his principles up to that point told him that what she was asking was wrong. All his love told him that she was right and he did what she asked.This film is quite different. His daughter was estranged. But she was very forgiving about that estrangement. So Eastwood has looked at this Father/Daughter relationship from two different angles. This one actually had the daughter present. She gave him her best shot and Amy Adams was just the girl to do it. She's smart, articulate, careful to listen before she speaks, emotional and very well balanced between what her head knows and what her heart feels. And she can express it fearlessly. Amy Adams is very very talented: there is nothing that she cannot express. Any father would be proud of her as Eastwood was.John Goodman was terrific in a very straight forward cameo roll. He was convincing as a friend and as a sort of Dutch Uncle.I took one point off for the music at the end. It was appropriate, but very jarring especially since we were quite mellow from the last scene.This is a new kind of sports film. I think it can be enjoyed by almost anyone. I'll likely watch it again.",9,2,4,26 September 2014
Hugo," 'Come and Dream with Me'
","This film is unlike any that Scorsese has ever made, or at least those of his that I've seen. It is a complex mixture of mechanics, imagination, familiar images, people's psychology and most of all dreaming the way children dream. It is both a tribute and a biography although to call it either would diminish what it really is – a masterpiece of a master storyteller.It is the story of one child prodigy (Hugo – acted by Asa Butterfield) who fixes things and who inherits from his father, an automaton that is broken.It is massively complex, but the boy is able to fix it. He cannot make it run however because he lacks one essential element and doesn't know where to find it. He meets a young girl his own age, 12 (Isabella – charmingly recreated by Chloe Grace Maretz that the Romance Novels would describe as 'having pluck.' She has around her neck, the piece of the machine that finally makes it work: It is a heart shaped key. By this time, we are so engrossed in the plot that the symbolism passes right by us. It does not pass by Scorsese though. He reminds us that without heart, nothing works. The heart is the key to turning us from machines into well functioning humans.Everyone of major importance seems to learn something, and as a consequence, so do we.Georges Mêlées (played by the master of understatement Ben Kingsley) learns that perhaps he should not look at the past as failings and filled with unimaginable horror. He should perhaps see the world as he and his wife created it for themselves. The world for them was for fun and dreams and wizards and mermaids and images that could come from no one but someone with a very fertile imagination who essentially loved. Mama Jeanne (his wife – Helen McCrory) is a startling woman who at just the right moment learns that she can make her husband see the world he left behind through her eyes. She learns that her feminine view has its place as well.Isabella has her first adventure and she laps it up the way a kitten laps a bowl of milk.Finally Hugo finds a family who understands him, and he learns that he can grow and develop.It's a fine film well worth an evening.",10,15,24,5 September 2012
Doctor Zhivago," Dr. Zhivago: a masterpiece of sound color environment tone and character.
","I will not summarize the plot. There are many others who have done that. Besides, the script really does not have a plot: it has a series of interwoven incidents that lead to an end only because the main character dies. That's really no spoiler. It's just where the movie ends.This movie has sumptuous sets. When people are eating, the food almost gives an aroma on the screen: the desserts almost smell sweet, the coffee is lavish and steaming like coffee which gives off a warm feeling. When people travel, the background of whites, greens and earth colors suggest the power of mother earth herself. When war comes, all the horrors of war are staged without all the blood in saving Private Ryan. Nothing is sanitized, but neither do we think of throwing up.The characters are all molded in a way that is best described by Yevgraf Zhivago (Alec Guinness) Even Comrade Lenin underestimated both the anguish of that 900-mile long front... as well our own cursed capacity for suffering.That is not a complete description but it is a beginning. Lara and Zhivago and to some extent, Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and her father (Ralph Richardson), had seen much and understood at a very deep level that 'the personal life was not dead,' it was the only life that mattered. No amount of suffering should destroy the personal life. All of the main characters share that in common. Their understanding of the world makes them stronger so they transcend their suffering.The love affair between Tonya and Zhivago and Zhivago and Lara are as natural as could be given the condition and time in which they lived. In a strange way neither one resented the other.Some men, including me, find it puzzling that anyone could be upset by the two love affairs Zhivago enjoyed. These two women, Lara and Tonya, understood perfectly that Zhivago could love both of them equally and value both of them for what they were, not what they were not.What Zhivago found in them were the best in women. He would have been happy with either separately if the other did not exist. He loved the familiar comfort that was Tonya's, and the mysterious feminine passive allure of Lara. Each rejoiced in what she received from the brooding Zhivago who was as earthy as he was ethereal, and as understanding as he was loving.I have not said anything about the other parts of the film because others have said it much better that I could. All of the first 15 or so reviews where taken in by the scenery, the acting, the direction, and the appropriateness of the choice of cast members. The music is astonishing and most people noted it. Rod Steiger and Tom Courtney are engrossing and frightening as many people noted.This is amongst my top ten films. As much as I like the other Lean pictures, I like this one the best.Without any hesitancy 10/10.",10,4,5,8 January 2008
P.S. I Love You," PS I love you is a controversial Film. I give it a ten, but
","I've read perhaps two-dozen reviews on this film. People either like it or they hate it: very few are in the middle.There are those who have lost mates and those who are going to perhaps and those who have not lost anyone, or have not said they have. There is no clear pattern although I would have to say that those who lost someone had the most decided feelings whichever way they felt about it.I have lost someone (my first wife). I know that this film avoids the reality of watching someone suffer pain and anger and not being able to do anything about it.The movie is only 2 hours long, a fact we often forget when watching films. Life can make us live through events that take months or years.Mourning is not easy. It is full of remembered joy and love, regret, guilt, loneliness, confusion, rage and a whole gamut of ugly and beautiful emotions almost too numerous to list.One lady I read said she hated the film because she found reminders everywhere: she would be completely unhinged by letters from the grave. I completely respect that point of view, and believe hers was a very real response.I do not share it. I wish I could send letters the other way. I wish I could tell her how much I miss her. I wish I could say some of the things she deserves to hear that I could not tell her while she lived. I wish I could thank her for the education she gave me just by living with me.That's what I think this film is about. Gerry (Gerald Butler) loves and is married to Holly (Hillary Swank). The opening scene before the credits shows them having a terrible fight where all their unspoken fundamental differences are shouted at each other. Then the credits. Then a new scene where there is Gerry's wake. Then a series of 10 letters, each one with another request and another part of the plan which he intends to heal her and lead her from mourning to health and perhaps to celebration.He knows her well. He suggests things that she would not do on her own, but that she needs to do. She needed to clean up the apartment, not because it would give her more room, but because it would give her emotions more space. There's quite a difference. She needs to get out and do things she was not good at (like sing) because singing is the language of the soul, and hers needed awakening. (Don't look for Swank to sing well. She doesn't.) She needed to go to Ireland, because it was not America and she needed to make contact with not only his body and mind, but his very essence.Slowly she finds her own talents, her own expressions, her own feelings, and her own way of celebrations. Kathy Bates is wonderful as the mother: tough as a steel girder, soft as pliable as paper. The two friends are a delight (although many people who saw this movie did not think so.) The hesitancy on my part only depends on how we can be swallowed not by what is, but what we wish to be true. Remember to read as many reviews as you can. Some people liked it; many did not. I am easily won over because I like Hilary Swank. Even her so/so movies get a good rating from me (like The Freedom Writers.)I saw this film in the same audience as 6 ten year old girls. I would have thought that this film was totally inappropriate for them. However when it was over, one of them said to one of the others, 'I really liked this film. It was so sad. I cried three times. How many times did you cry?' The sadness struck me as well. I could have answered her question if asked. She would have given it ten out of ten. So would I, but I understand those who would not.",10,1,3,24 February 2008
Gran Torino," Remarkable As Only Eastwood Could Make It
","This film is a very difficult one to review. It is hard to summarize the plot because everything in it leads to the climax and that is a spoiler.That which is part of the bonding process between the main character (Eastwood as Walt Kowalski) and Thao (Bee Vang) is safe to talk about, but not the major part of the film.We are introduced to Kowalski who has spent his entire life post Korea as a mean spirited prejudiced man whose next door neighbors turn out to be people that look to him like those he fought (and killed) in Korea. He does not like them: he wants them to leave him in peace. One day a gang of 'zipper heads' comes looking for the young boy Kowalski will later befriend. Kowalski becomes a neighborhood hero when he orders one of the gang members off his property. 'Get. Off. My. Lawn!' sounds every bit as menacing as anything Dirty Harry would have said. Kowalski manages to stare the thugs down. It helps that he has a gun in his hands. He begins to realize that these people really appreciate what he has done. He begrudgingly accepts his role as their American protector.How he gets involved in their lives, how he remains in their lives, how he gets deeper and deeper into their plight, how he first defends what is his and then defends his neighbors is what the film is primarily about as far as the plot is concerned.It goes much deeper of course. This is a Clint Eastwood film so nothing is as simple as it seems. There is one thing that few reviewers have taken note of and it is well worth developing. Every so often, Eastwood has to visit the Catholic Church as he did in Million Dollar Baby. This film presents a priest who is both worldly and very sympathetic in Father Janovich.Father Janovich begins by trying to fulfill a promise he made to Kowalski's wife. He promised her that he would hear Kowalski's confession. We get the idea that though he is well meaning, he cannot stand up to the horror that Kowalski knows from his war experiences. In fact, he can because he is a humane man who has spent time considering the moral contradictions man is prone to find himself in.Father Janovich may not know much about violent death, nor about the relationship between men and women (he freely admits to his ignorance of both), but he knows something he does not think Kowalski knows much about, and that is a life that is not so filled with anamousity.Janovich is interesting because he sympathizes with Kowalski and does his very best to prevent what he knows is inevitable.We would all like to have such a friend, such a spiritual leader, such a good person as Father Janovich. Kowalski does not hesitate to acknowledge this once he learns what Father Janovich does know.It is a remarkable film. One well worth its time. I gave it a nine only because I was comparing it to other Eastwood films. I think Million Dollar Baby is in a class by itself. It's the 10. This film is a very close second.",9,1,7,10 May 2009
Back to the Future Part III," Terrific Easily worth it's ten
","I was surprised to learn that people thought this was the weak link in the series. It is perhaps the most delightful because of the addition of Mary Steenburgen, Doc's unexpected love interest.She makes every film she's in a little special. Women could really take lessons on how she does it. Or maybe we'll never know. She played the same sort of role in Time After Time (1979). She's very formal, but because she's not the best looking person in any group of people, she lets it be known that she's very interested in letting the relationship go further. Give nothing, receive everything. Especially in the beginning. If ever there was a woman who represents the feminine mystique (or what men think of as the feminine mystique) it is embodied in Mary Steenburgen.The characters she creates are intelligent, been around, knows what's happening, but always takes a chance because one time she's not going to be disappointed. Doc doesn't stand a chance: it's not only her intelligence. It's she.Then there's Tannon. He would gladly rape Clara, but he would never succumb to her wiles. When 'Mad Dog' (hope he never reads this -- he hates the name from anyone but his friends and I don't dance very well) wants to kill Doc at the dance, Marty throws a pie plate to spoil his aim. When Buford Tannon ('Mad Dog') issues his threat, he finds out he has such a busy itinerary of wrong doing that the soonest he can work it in is two days hence, first thing in the morning. It's a Mastercard Priceless moment.Doc himself is his usual energetic goofy self, inventing things that raise absurdity to a new level. What makes him so funny is that he never tells a joke, would not understand one if it was told, and babbles scientific principles that exist only in his own mind -- certainly in no text I've ever read.Michael J. Fox is just right for the part. Even his counterpart in 1885 Shames McFly from Ireland you understand is a scream on the screen and yet there seems to be nothing you could point to that would make him as appealing and humorous as he is other than to say Fox exudes charm the way a boyish teenage class president exudes charm.This is a film worth spending a couple of hours with. Enjoy its enthusiasm and good humor. I think it is by far the best of the three.",10,1,1,16 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Terrific Movie
","I don't know if I can write a review on this. There are 83 pages of reviews  many of them good. Many are fair in both their praise and reservations. I found the details wonderful in both their simplicity and effect.The film starts like something done as a film noir. In fact, Million Dollar Baby would have been an ideal candidate for black and white.After winning a particularly brutal fight, Frankie Dunne's (Clint Eastwood) championship caliber boxer begs a favor. He asks Frankie to go get his wife's car back, which Frankie does. The boxer comes to thank Frankie, (we think, but there is hesitancy). He wants another manager and he leaves Frankie. Though it turns out to be a good move for the younger man professionally, it shows him to be rather thankless and ruthless. Certainly Frankie is not part of his family: he owes Frankie nothing. We don't see any loyalty and gratitude: just a cold business relationship.Though there is no evidence in the film to suggest it, I think that explains why he so hesitant to take on Maggie. He spent eight years with the other fighter and he thinks he will have to spend another 4 on Maggie. It's too much. He's tired. He just wants to go to church write his weekly letters and banter with Scrape. We see Frankie begging for the easy way.Perhaps that is why Scrape (Morgan Freeman) keeps needling him. He wants Frankie to try again. He sees something in Maggie and he instinctively knows she will be good for Frankie. Frankie doesn't know. He's a devout Catholic (about which his priest is almost totally opaque): he doubts he can stand the guilt of the failure of yet one more relationship.The priest in the first scene is totally unsympathetic (or seems so). He asks Frankie if has written his daughter. Frankie tells him every week. We are led to believe that the priest does not believe him. It is a brutal miscalculation from the church's representative. Frankie is used to that: he deals with brutality daily. Why should the church be any different than the rest of his life? These details are foreshadows of what will come.What Frankie finds in Maggie is a woman trusts her feelings. Probably the best part in the movie is the diner scene where Scrape tells us why he never had fight 110. Much has been said about this scene. (The best description is in Roger Ebert's review. Check it out). Maggie learns why Frankie is such a good manager. Maggie knows class when she hears it and she knows life poetry when it's spoken to her. Another manager? Not on her life.There is nothing but love and loyalty in this girl. Contrast Frankie as a father with her actual mother. Maggie does everything a daughter should and her mother insists on treating her as a ten year old who has to be corrected. But Maggie knows some things and tries to be a kind loving adult daughter only to be reprimanded by a fool and a course lazy lout of a mother. It is no wonder she loves Frankie. He was the parent she never really had.Now we come to the real spoiler. We find out that Frankie really has written his daughter once a week. He has kept all his letters (which were returned unread and unopened).After a terrible event in the ring, Maggie has her neck broken. She is a vegetable compared to the way she was. She is not sorry. There are no heroics in any of her statements. She tells him that she has heard the crowds and she does not want the voices to go away. She wants to die. She wants him to help her. In her mind, she is the same as a crippled dog she had as a child. The dog finally had to be put down by her father.He is horrified. He cannot do such a thing. He goes to the priest. He is completely torn apart. Not even his daughter had this effect on him. His tears are those of someone in the deepest anguish. He knows she's right. This was a girl who was nearly a champion athlete who now is not only confined to a bed but who can only be put in a wheel chair after hours of effort.Perhaps because I'm not Catholic, I find the priest's attitude almost incomprehensible. He does not seem to be able to think outside the box. He gives Frankie the standard position about taking life and threatens alienation from the church and with it eternal damnation (the latter implied from the former). The priest does not truly see the problem and Frankie in tears, knows it.Maggie will not accept life that is really a prolonged death and tries to commit suicide by biting her tongue. It is then that Frankie knows what he has to do. It is the tenderest scene in the move. It is so touching that no one with feelings can avoid registering the over powering human conflicts that take only minutes to show. It is one of the great love scenes ever made. Who knew that Dirty Harry had it in him? In the end we are left with Scrape who tries to explain to Frankie's daughter the nature of the man she has stubbornly refused to have anything to do with. She is making a terrible mistake in not acknowledging him. Scrape does it not for Frankie. He does it for her.If there are people who thought this was an OK movie, they either did not see the one I did, or they can't feel. It is the summary of a man's life and it has nothing to do with occupation. It has to do with value.",10,2,4,7 January 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Excellent. See it, especially if you lived through it.
","Black and White. Bleak. The fifties.Most people who lived through the 50's thought it was a simpler time. I did not. It was complex, characterized by people seeking conformity and security who would pay almost anything to get both.The hero was not a person like Gary Cooper in High Noon. The hero was more like the complicated conformist in The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit.The reaction to that conformity was the 60's and anyone who lived through those times would certainly say they were about anything other than fitting into a mold.Furthermore, we should not be confining ourselves to McCarthy. He was a drunken egotist who knew a good thing when he found it. What we should be looking at are those people who thought McCarthy was not only right, but the political guardian and watch dog of civilization as we knew it then.Who were these people? Why were they so willing to give up their civil rights? And who was Edward R. Murrow and what did he do to remind them that they were giving something up? Those are the questions this film asks and tries to answer. People who go to thinking or spiritual movies quite frequently forget that a movie is only 2 hours long. There is not the time to develop ideas in the same way that an action film can move along. There is only time to suggest probe and provoke into doing more research.This film is not boring. It tries to tell us what Morrow faced and each character is a little flawed and a great deal more decent.I cannot end without talking about something personal. I grew up in Canada at the height of McCarthy's power. My city at the time was 13000, still small enough that everyone knew everyone, especially since my father was a doctor who was killed in the second world war. My mother was newly widowed and my brother had just finished his Phd and was applying for work at Bell Tel. He required clearance. I do not remember exactly who came to our door, but I do remember my mother's response.She was terrified. She did not believe for a moment the reassurance that it was a routine questioning for his clearance. She was too new to the country not to believe that if she gave the wrong answer my brother would be doomed or that we would. And we lived in Canada.There was that in the air. And it was palpable and I can remember the emotion. That's what happens when people give up their civil rights.It is why we need another Edward R. Morrow.And it is why this film is so good: it begs us to listen once he surfaces.",10,1,2,9 February 2006
The Terminal," Very good film
","I liked The Terminal. I liked all of the people and all of the situations.Most people who saw this liked the minor characters especially Gupta who took particular delight in watching people slide on his wet floor.That was fine, but not to be difficult I liked the courtship between the very shy but proper food delivery person and the immigration official better. Navorski was kind gentle and wise as acting as their Cyrano. He neither fell in love with nor did he take advantage of her.The Terminal is a romance in the tradition of (say) Picnic. As a teenage, I watched with envy as William Holden easily courted a beautiful, vulnerable younger Kim Novac. What did it matter that he was old enough to be her father? The girls in movie houses still drooled over him and wished they were her. So with this. Most male reviewers take exception to Zeta Jones in The Terminal. Much more sophisticated these days. Pity. She was actually quite good. She was like the little Mermaid: much of what she conveyed could not be done with her voice. The same thing with the Zeta Jones character: everything she said had to be done with her eyes and tears. She knows Navorski's value. She knows his character and how good he is. She wants him and is certain he wants and deserves her, but she knows that sooner or later she will betray him and that would devastate him. She knows herself so well that she feels unworthy of him. She cannot betray such a good and honorable man. What then does that make her? Is she any less honorable and worthy? Should she be any less desirable for the boys than William Holden for the girls? This film is not Schindler's List. But it's not Beach Blanket Bingo either. It is a wonderful character study well worth seeing.",Null,97,161,24 September 2004
The Martian," Make it so ...
","I had trouble with this movie. Someone should remind produces that movies are about 2 hours long. They can't include everything. The Chinese really serve no useful purpose here, as they debate whether to help or not using subtitles.There was an awful lot of talk. By and large, Matt Damon delivered it well: if he had not, the film would have been a total bomb. He is engaging, charming, witty, observant, intelligent and courageous. He does convey (lightly) the problems he has and so by the end, we believe him when he says At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And If you solve enough problems, you get to come home.But the dialogue can become tiresome, especially when nothing is really going on. Many people I've talked to found the syllogism on becoming a space pirate very engaging. I did not. At best it was sophistry and at worst garble that took up valuable time. I defer, however, to those that liked it.It is long.It does not have well developed minor characters.It has scenes and speeches that are inappropriate or at best underdeveloped It had Picardian science (Jon Luc Picard -- Star Trek -- The Next Generation) who is wont to say 'Make it so.' Well just because he commands it to be so, does not make it so -- like explaining the sling shot effect to the director of NASA. The Director of NASA would understand what it was.If you want to see how this movie should be done, rent Apollo 13 and save yourself 25 dollars doing it. See how Ed Harris plays Jeff Daniel's part and how Tom Hanks does the Martian.That is not actually the fault of either Daniels or Damon. It is the fault of the writer and the director.Still I gave it a six. That's because Damon doesn't fail -- ever.",6,9,17,28 October 2015
