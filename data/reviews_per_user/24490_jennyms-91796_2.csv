Blade Runner 2049," disappointing
","Visually, this movie was great. Nice colour scheme, gorgeous scenic shots, some really cool designs for your classic sci-fi tech.Story-wise, it was okay. Clich√©d and predictable, but for casual movie goers it should be your regular 'hero has pretty girlfriend and saves the wold' plot.What really bothered me was how painfully long it was.
The viewer knows what's going to happen as soon as the scene begins. The viewer understands what's happening and what the character is feeling, the acting and general visuals are strong enough for that.
So why do we have to draw out every single shot of someone staring into the distance, walking through hallways, driving through cities, ... ?Was also disappointed by how little screentime Harrison Ford actually had, considering how heavily they advertised his presence.Nostalgia and low standards might make this movie enjoyable for some, but anyone who prefers action or plot filled films should spend their money elsewhere.",4,2,6,1 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Absolutely Stunning!
","I am blown away!Visually absolutely gorgeous, the comic style/s were beautifully integrated into the 3d animated world, amazing work with colours.
Soundtrack was epic as well, always brought the right mood, made you want to sing and dance.The story is exactly what a good marvel movie is all about: a story about people who are superheroes!
Humour, emotion, epic battles, I laughed and I cried a lot.Cameos and easter eggs for nerds to find, an overall lighthearted mood for younger audiences, the kind of movie that anyone can enjoy!This is what Marvel has always been for me.
Will watch this movie a million times more!",9,8,16,17 December 2018
