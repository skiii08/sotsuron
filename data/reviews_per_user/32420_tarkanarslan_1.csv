The Equalizer," Denzel makes the movie to watch.
","Denzel Washington's performance and the film's high-voltage action premise make it one to watch. Denzel makes the movie to watch.His character is fascinating to watch.He is just so intense and in control and you get to see the nice guy inside of this obviously well-trained killer.This is the role made for Denzel. If you like cool, kick ass films you will be happy to watch. I enjoyed and recommend it to be watched.I also liked the quotes; 'What do you see when you see me?','Got to be who you are in this world, no matter what.', 'I am offering you a chance to do the right thing. Take it.', 'When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.'",7,0,2,24 December 2014
