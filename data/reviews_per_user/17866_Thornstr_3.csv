Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," embarrassing
","I don't know the case in other countries, but here in Sweden a channel recently bought the rights for all four Star Wars movies and is airing them every weekend at 9 pm (only two weeks left now until the premiere of episode II). This meant I first got to see Episode I and then Episode IV the next day. What I realized is that Episode IV actually seems more expensive than Episode I. It's a little bit like comparing Doctor Who with Toy Story if you know what I mean :) Even if it doesn't look exactly perfect I prefer real-looking stuff made out of real junk, compared to computer-made things that does neither look cool nor real. Episode I is, and will always be, a disappointment to me.",6,1,2,5 May 2002
Snatch," Best picture of the year
","I read several reviews of Snatch before I took the chance to see it, and many critics seemed disappointed with the fact that it is so similar to Lock, Stock... Well, I don't think that is a reason to trash this movie. It really is the best movie I've seen this year! It is even better than Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.Guy Ritchie is one of the best directors ever - I mean it! He plays a lot with the camera, and the result is more than excellent. The opening credits is among the best I've seen. One fact that strikes me is how fast-paced and full of energy the movie is. Not one second more than necessary is in here, and with this many characters and stories taking place, quite a lot takes place during the almost-two-hours.The ending scenes is so beautifully shot that my heart stopped for a few minutes. Now I thought Fight Club was beautifully shot in its similar scenes, but this is even better. Brad Pitt makes his part quite good, but he shouldn't be the reason why you're seeing it. A LOT of guys could have played his role just as good.Warning! I saw the movie twice in a row and absolutely loved it, but when I forced my parents and my brother to see it, they lost interest after a while and didn't finish the movie. They just didn't think it was funny. First of all, I guess this is a movie for boys. And you probably have to enjoy violence. I mean, it isn't real, it's not like I go out and kill someone after I've seen it. If you just relax and enjoy the different universe the movie creates, it will be a blast.Rating 9 out of 10",9,1,1,20 May 2001
Armageddon," Camera switching too fast?
","I don't know if it's just me, but isn't the pacing a little too fast? I mean, they change the camera angle twice every second, and I never really felt that I was in the movie. It was more like watching a nice but 2 hour long trailer. I'm sorry to say that more and more movies are done this way - even if Michael Bay is extreme. What ever happened to the camera techniques that were used in superb movies like Escape from New York and so on...? The movies 'flow' is slow, but still very exciting and, according to me, has much more 'feeling' about it.... Hopefully more people agree with me. And don't get me started about slow-motion ;) Yep, slow-motion is too slow, and again you feel like watching a trailer... Once again Escape from New York shows how to make a really good movie without using slow-motion either.",6,0,1,25 June 1999
