Requiem for a Dream," eye-opening delve into the horrors of drug addiction
","Absolutely brilliant, enthralling and heart-breaking sums Requiem up quite well!!! My A-Level film studies teacher opened my eyes to it and when i had the option of studying this for a piece of coursework, i didn't find it very hard to choose which film to do!!! Watching the 4 main characters becoming overwhelmed by their drug addictions is difficult, but you wont be able to prise your eyes from the screen. As, step-by-step, they grow further and further away you can't help but feel an enormous amount of pity towards them. I've never seen a film as visually striking as Requiem, and can't possibly think i ever will again! The camera work is excellent, the acting is excellent and the storyline is excellent. Its a must see film, but if you're looking for a cheesy comedy or romance, look elsewhere!!!!!!!",10,2,4,8 January 2006
