Black Swan," Absolute stunner
","well i was frowned after seeing the movie. Natalie Portman no doubt she is meant to hold the academy award during this February. the reward goes to all of the crew. Darren he's mind blowing. in spite of everyone has did their best,its the Natalie(Nina) who will be in your mind after u watched it, in the first Nina was a fabulous in white swan but she struggles for the black swan.the editing and the screenplay will blow u away, hats off to Darren in bringing out their best. the supporting actress Mila Kunis(Lily) played her best in this masterpiece. not to mention the Vincent Cassel(Thomas Leoroy) who was quite beautiful in bringing the best from Nina.u will not forget the final part of the movie. i really kept a silence for a minute after the final scene. i swear u that this was the first movie to make me silent for a minute where as i used to give claps for the movies which i like.make your pop corn hot, cool coke grab u r ticket and see a masterpiece...if Portman is the swan queen, Darren is the swan king",10,3,7,2 January 2011
