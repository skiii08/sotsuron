The New World," Absolutely beautiful
","I love Terrence Malick's style and if I was to become a director,he would be a director I would look to for influence.I'd actually put this on a par with Badlands but superior to The Thin Red Line.Everything is so lush and otherworldly in this film, from the unblemished America to the stately English gardens. Although this is Malick's show there is a fantastic performance from Q'rianka Kilcher, and Farrell seems as graceful as he will ever be.The New World is so beautiful that many films will seem brash after you see it.Transcendental cinema.",9,5,11,11 March 2006
American Beauty," Spec-tacular
","This is one of my favorite films.Kevin Spacey is superb,probably his best performance, and there are all-round great performances from the supporting cast.There are tonnes of great lines and Mendes' direction is fantastic, an extremely promising debut.Obviously many will be drawn to the rebellious midlife crisis/coming of age aspect to the film but I think this is a great existential drama as well.The film looks fantastic and the score from Newton Howard suits the varying moods well. To anyone who enjoyed American Beauty I would recommend films like Road to Perdition,Donnie Darko and Wonder Boys.An intelligent,essential,existential masterpiece.",9,0,2,4 March 2006
