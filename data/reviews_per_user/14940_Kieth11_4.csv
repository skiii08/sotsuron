Hereditary," Terrifying ride
","This movie is not for the faint hearted. As a horror movie fanatic, I watched this, not really sure what to expect. This movie delivers on insane amounts of horror, both visual and psychological. Excellent cast and excellent sound design make this movie what it is.If you are a fan of horror movies, watch this one.",10,2,4,14 March 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Very good beginning to an excellent ending
","This is a movie that should not be missed. It has it all, action, adventure, and fantasy. This I think is a bit better than part 2, simply because it has more action, and more suspense, which I love in movies. Many scenes that just give me the chills, although it is animated and on the 'unrealistic' side of things. Such as when Ron gets shot by some spell and you see his skin on his arm is gone, and Hermine uses something that she puts on his arm, and you hear a sizzling sound. The ending of the movie is really good, and gets you really pumped up for part 2, when Voltemort (don't know how to spell that) get's the most powerful wand in the world. There are many scenes that make you tense up, and makes you feel as if there is a spider crawling down your back. For those of you that like feeling dread, and a little scared, this is the move for you.",10,0,1,25 March 2012
Thor," Lots and Lots of Action
","This movie is all about action, and the writers did a fine job, I have to say, including tons of action in a way that draws your mind away from all your troubles. There is a light love theme, which I feel is very nice, just the right amount. The movie starts out very well, with a slight flash of the future. I was, I admit, a little disappointed that there was only one enemy, but this movie is not just about the 'almighty Thor' battling enemies, which would have made the movie extremely dumb. As I recall my memories of the movie, for some reason, I don't know where the action was, aside from the battle with Thor and an Iron Giant, and Thor and his friends against the Ice Giants. The way the producers made the show is incredible, squeezing so much action into an hour and fifteen minute film, and make it interesting. This movie is incredibly fast-paced, and some people might have a hard time following it, but I'll give you a hint, this show is a movie that you really have to relax, and not think about anything in order to understand it. Because it's fast-paced, you probably won't remember your questions anyway.",10,1,2,27 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Disappointing
","The first movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was really good, although I have never read the book, I loved it, and I wanted to see this one really badly, but it, I'm afraid, let me down tremendously. The roller coaster scene is unforgettable, and very well done. It's kind of funny and unexpected when they literally drop out of the cart. Other than that, the ending like, 45 minutes was really incredibly disappointing. It was stupid, and even with all the magic happening, seeing the whole time, pretty much two beams of light coming from a stick is boring, even when, sometimes an interesting thing happens in between each light display. Part 1 was really intense, and gave me a feeling as if a spider was crawling down my back, and there were very, very few, and short scenes like that in Part 2. I expected more.",7,0,2,25 March 2012
