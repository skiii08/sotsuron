The Blair Witch Project," Deserves an Oscar for 'Hype of the Year'...
","The pre-release publicity campaign for Blair Witch was truly awesome in its success at building anticipation, from the teen-target word of mouth stage right through the SciFi Channel hourlong trailer that set the movie up very effectively for its limited release in major US cities.  It's been many a full moon since this filmlover has seen an audience so charged up that they literally were running into the theatre to grab a good seat. We were going to see something new, something different. Above all, we were going to experience a film which was 'Scary as Hell!'Instead, we got faux cinema verite with just a hint of Tobe Hooper.  Instead of shock we got a crock.  The cinematography, let's face it, was just plain poor.  The vaunted 'performances' of the three leads were adequate acting-class improv.  The ending simply did nothing with the basic premise except to close it within the acceptable minimum running time.  As a fear-inducing entertainment, Blair Witch is dead on arrival.  When it opens wide this weekend, many an exhibitor will be deluged with demands for return of the ticket price.  Those reviewers and fans who suffer from the Emporer's New Clothes Complex (I believe this will be great, therefore it is!) are in for a mighty repudiation from the American filmgoing public, and Artisan, which artfully managed the hype-machine on this little movie, will be forced to pull the plug on any notion of mass-market success with this TBWP. This said, Blair Witch does work really well on one level.  As a metaphor for the ignorance and ineptitude of the American media covering any story of real importance, the film is, in fact, a powerful indictment. I do suspect this was the real intent of the filmakers, so blatant is this theme as the movie unreels.  But as a fearsome chiller-thriller of the psychological variety? Please.  For real films of this type, I refer the interested reader to Polanski's The Tenant, to Cronenberg's Videodrome, to M, Peeping Tom, or The (original) Haunting.  Blair Witch is worth seeing, but for none of the reasons put forth by its publicity campaign.  Filmgoers not conditioned to believe everything they hear will feel ripped off by Artisan, the Sundance crowd, and the filmakers themselves.To these, I have one last word:Booo!",1,1,3,27 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park...Love It Or Leave It
","Absolutely no one who sits through the entire film has any right to complain.  This is not Blair Witch, folks.  You were not lured into the theatre under false pretenses.  It is just like the TV show only more so.  If you like the show, the movie will delight you. If you don't, what the hell are you doing in the theatre?  Dementia of the highest order.  An art film.

The Exorcist," The Classic. See it again on DVD soon. Banishes the Blair Witch Blues...
","In this millinneum summer, when little stick figures and poor camera work and three whiny improvers have convinced America to be very afraid, it can be instructional and even inspirational to revisit the truly great works of the horror genre.The Exorcist may be the best ever.  Now available on a beautiful DVD transfer, this brilliant William Friedkin film looks better than ever.  Devoid of the considerable hype which accompanied both the book and subsequent film of this title when first released in the seventies, the film actually grows in power. Director Friedkin, working a familiar vein, never once falls into the kind of cliches which endear the old Hammer and Castle films.  It all looks and sounds fresh and real.  The cast is simply perfect, the pacing is impeccable, the horror truly and deeply delivered directly to the viewer's soul.If you felt let down by all the hype (and then the reality) of The Blair Witch Project, or if you'd simply like to see one of the really great horror films, check this out soon, even if you've seen it before.  I had, several times years ago.  But The Exorcist, if anything, has gained power with time.",10,0,0,9 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," A taut excercise in directorial discipline...truly thrilling.
","This is that rarity in American Popular film, a true director's picture.  M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed The Sixth Sense, and it is so carefully constructed in every respect that it creates a world with its own natural laws, in the way that Hitchcock's or Ford's films do.  Every cast member is in perfect tune with the director's mission here. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and Olivia Williams play each role beautifully, in service to Shyamalan's story. Haley Joel Osment, as the psychic child Cole, and Donnie Wahlberg, as a homicidal psychotic, deliver two of the years' most powerful performances.This is another of those films about which the less said about plot, the better.  Suffice to say there are thrills and chills but no gratuitous violence of any kind.  This may be one of the least melodramatic 'ghost' pictures in the history of cinema.  In tone, it's closer to a movie like 'Little Man Tate' than to other horror films which feature children, such as 'The Shining' or 'Poltergiest'.  And that subtlety is much to the credit of the director, from whom I'll be looking for great things in the future.PKL",9,0,0,8 August 1999
