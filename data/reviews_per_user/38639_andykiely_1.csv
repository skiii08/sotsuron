50 First Dates," Beckett's Influence on this Film
","Samuel Beckett is an Irish playwright who wrote a famous play called Waiting For Godot. This play involves an existential battle between two people one of whom forgets everything that is said to him within seconds of hearing it. It is play based on the idea that even in pointless and meaningless existence there is hope. I think this film touches on the same ideas and would be interested if anyone thinks the same way. Although I cannot compare this film to what is a classic of modern literature I have seen many examples of seemingly frivolous movies showing an obvious allusion to more serious forms of philosophical thought. The characters in this film are, after all, dealing with the very essence of what it means to be human. Our experience of life makes us who we are.",Null,0,0,20 July 2005
