Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Predecessors carried this one to mucho bucks!
","George Lucas took too much time off between movies.  He lost the fun and fantasy of the first three movies.  I found this extremely boring and just a special effects movies.   That new character Jar Jar something, needed subtitles to understand what he said.  I was extremely disappointed in this movies and it wasted 2+ hours of my time.  I won't be viewing the next two movies.",2,0,1,25 November 2001
