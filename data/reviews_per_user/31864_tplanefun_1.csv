3:10 to Yuma," Watch the original
","I have made the mistake of watching a lot of old westerns and hoping that the new ones can measure up to those standards. Unfortunately this one did not. If you like blood & guts and the Matrix type movies this version is for you. If you are looking for a saga, gritty, good vs evil watch the original. Westerns made today are cowboy dressed up versions of the Transformers with special effects, things blowing up and slow motion bullets going into the heads of their targets. The days of cinematography, real dust, camera angles, herds of cattle and cowboys who know how to ride, seem to be past, or faded into the sunset.",4,7,11,16 January 2012
