The Sound of Music," Worst Rodgers & Hammerstein Musical
","I have to think that the people who rave about this movie have not seen the bulk of the MGM musicals.  If you want to see great musicals, see State Fair, South Pacific, or Oklahoma, for starters.  Except for Christopher Plummer, the acting in Sound of Music is awful. The movie weighs in at almost 3 hours and you'll feel every minute.  The movie is so long the songs have to all be sung several times, which is not a good thing.  Overblown, overhyped, overlong.",3,12,36,29 March 1999
Mulan," Best Disney Animated Movie in Years
","I really enjoyed Mulan at the theatre, and watching the video confirmed my initial impression.  It has only a few songs, but they are very good.  The regular animation is okay with some very nice moments, and the computer animation is stunning.  The pacing and story are what really lift this movie above the recent Disney fare.  As an overall package, it ranks with the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast as the best of the 'modern' Disney animated movies (a pox on the Lion King and that lousy Elton John score!).",10,1,1,6 February 1999
Singin' in the Rain," Not the best Gene Kelly musical
","I've read the raves, but I don't understand them.  The dancing is rather tepid, the songs are fair, and Donald O'Connor must be an acquired taste. Gene Kelly's dancing with Cyd Charisse is great, but I would rank On the Town, It's Always Fair Weather, An American in Paris, and Brigadoon as far, far superior to this movie.  Check them out - if you loved Singin' in the Rain, these other movies will completely blow you away.",6,2,7,8 March 1999
