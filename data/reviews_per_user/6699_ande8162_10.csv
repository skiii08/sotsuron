Changeling," The true, true story
","Two captivating true stories converge to create a rich, epic drama. You have the legendary, chilling account of the 'chicken coup murders' which would make a great film on it's own, but takes more of a backseat to the virtually unknown story of the Christine Collins case. Screenwriter Straczynski literally unearthed the details of her ordeal from the LAPD archives right before they were about to burn everything. He spent years doing extensive research on the case so he could be sure it would be a 'true story' and not just 'based on a true story.' It paid off. The true story is far better, and crazier, than any fictionalization would have been. I'm not a big Eastwood fan, but I love what he did with this film. In my opinion, this is an outright horror movie. I'm sure it's a lot scarier than the Friday the 13th remake. I also really liked the way he handled the period aspects. He made 1920s and 30s Los Angeles into a vivid world all its own. I loved how new characters keep popping up as the movie goes along, and each one of them is performed brilliantly. What begins as a simple little story goes far and wide with several stops at very unexpected places along the way.",9,4,5,20 February 2009
Milk," I'm here to recruit you.
","This is not just a great and important civil rights film; it's an inspiring true story about the political process and the power a leader can have by using tactics like honesty and integrity over manipulation and lies. This is also an example of how to make a successful biopic. The writer has to find the balance between the actual events and dramatic thrust. The actor has to become the person they're portraying; it's not just impersonation but actually understanding the life of someone else. Finally, the director has to figure out exactly how that particular story should be told. There are so many strong performances in this movie: James Franco and Emile Hirsch; Josh Brolin as the mysteriously tortured Dan White. Above all, I celebrate Sean Penn and the work he's been doing. Last year he proved himself a proficient director with INTO THE WILD, and now this is probably the most fully realized character of his acting career. His Harvey Milk is heart-warming and just an extremely likable guy, someone you'd want to sit down and have a drink with. Gus Van Sant nailed it. I've loved his more recent independent, semi-surreal dramas, particularly ELEPHANT and LAST DAYS. He could have employed the same dreamlike methods with MILK and gone the route of telling this story the way he told Cobain's in LAST DAYS, preferring visual poetry over traditional narrative. I'm sure that could have been a great movie as well, but Van Sant made the smart move by returning to a more mainstream approach. This is still an artistically satisfying film, and I'm sure a very personal project as well, but it's presented as an accessible, straight forward true story. This is a film for everyone, and people need to see this movie. I challenge anyone, regardless of your views, to go see this with an open mind and be able to keep a dry eye all the way through. If you can give it a chance and still not be moved, I would question your humanity, and that's the power of this very timely and effective film and the life of a man named Harvey Milk.",9,4,11,28 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Fargo 2
","Over a decade later, No Country for Old Men is the perfect companion to the Coens' 1996 masterpiece. Both films boil down to the tragic consequences of desperate measures people will take out of greed, and both are hilarious all along the way. Set in the 1980s, a time before internet and cell phones, Fargo and No Country follow the paths of characters on both sides of the law. Parallel scenes in each film involve murder investigations by the local law enforcement as they attempt to make sense of the mess; however, the body count is much higher in No Country. Each film displays the problem with everyday men trying to be criminals; they make a lot of mistakes. The white plains of Minnesota winter has become the tan Texas desert, but surroundings match the outlook of both films spot-on: bleak.With No Country, the Coens' writing is at its best ever with top-notch dialogue and unconventional plot structure, but as much credit, if not more, is due to their collaborator, novelist Cormac McCarthy. This film is the first official novel adaptation for the Coens, and it was definitely a good move on their part. It's the sort of story you get thrown into, and before you realize what's hit you, you're on a bloody, unpredictable ride.Chief Gunderson's optimism in Fargo gives that film a dash of hope, but No Country is as dark and hopeless as they come. The cynicism is all seen in Sheriff Bell's face (Tommy Lee Jones) as he stands in the morgue staring at a body, don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything here. As the titular 'old man,' the shot is obviously meant to show just how wrinkled Jones has become in his old age. There are hard lines under his eyes, and the skin sags off his cheeks. He's seen enough.",9,2,16,12 November 2007
Revolutionary Road," Perfect hopelessness
","Having read and loved the novel, I can honestly say this is one of the best book to screen adaptations I've seen. It's extremely faithful to Richard Yates' 1961 brooding tale but also highly imaginative in its cinematic reconfiguration. In a way, the film had a stronger impact on me than the book. Going through that whole story in two hours is a devastating experience.Everyone who worked on this did such a solid job. The entire cast was magnificent. I won't elaborate on any individual performance, because each actor played it to perfection. Director Sam Mendes finally lives up to the standard he set with his first picture, American BEAUTY. Exploring the dark side of American suburbia definitely works for him. Thomas Newman's score is haunting and, although less complex, reminiscent of American BEAUTY's heavily atmospheric soundtrack.The entire movie is gorgeous to watch. It's full of powerful images that will burn into your memory. I loved the slight surreality to everything. The styles, colors, and strict conformity of 1950s Connecticut has an other-worldly quality. I think it was the right choice to, ever so slightly, heighten and exaggerate the emotions and relations of the characters. It added much needed humor at times and kept things from getting overly raw and dirty. Despite all the stylistic choices, I still felt it was very grounded in reality, and I found it to be almost embarrassingly relatable at times.If anything negative can be said, I could see this getting criticized for being too perfect, too calculated, too Oscar oriented. It may be all those things, but it's also full of life and truth. The novel is a literary classic. The rights for the film were purchased not long after its original publication, but at that time, no one knew how to make it. Everything aligned just right for this movie to happen. I couldn't imagine this film existing any differently. It may take place in a bygone era, but it has everything needed to be a timeless classic, and as long as people keep getting married, it will always be relevant.",10,7,12,31 December 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Rough cut presented as finished product
","I'm really having a difficult time trying to understand what happened here. I do believe there may be a great film somewhere in this mess, so why couldn't Fincher and Co. find it? It seems like they just went ahead and shot the very first draft of the script without much deliberation. I rarely complain about film length, but considering the slow nature of the story, this really was far too long. Uninteresting and unnecessary scenes take up way too much of the running time. Cutting at least a half hour might have drastically improved the flow of things. The entire structure was extremely uneven. Episodic storytelling is a great device, but fails when it all of a sudden feels like a completely different film (and one that you'd rather be watching) The most inspired scene of the movie comes out of nowhere. The events leading up to a traffic accident are picked apart piece by piece in an energetic, detailed analysis of cause and effect, but there's nothing else like it in the entire film. Cate Blanchett is fantastic and Brad Pitt performs a great balancing act considering all the technicalities of the role and scattered story, but the problem with the character of Benjamin Button is that he's really not a very interesting person. His condition takes the place of any real personality and you never really get to know him. The title fits. Curiosity will likely draw a lot of people to see this film, and it is worth seeing, once.",7,4,8,30 December 2008
The Dark Knight," I believe in Christopher Nolan
","Dun Dun Dun DunDun Dun Dun Dun DunDun! THE DARK KNIGHT is an intense cinematic experience and a testament to fine film-making. I bestow the majority of my praise on director Christopher Nolan. He and brother Jonathan crafted an ambitious script of epic scale. So much happens in this story, and in the wrong hands this film could have become a huge mess, but Nolan executes every scene with visionary perfectionism. The evolution of style from BATMAN BEGINS serves it well. Gotham feels even more real-world this time around and the plot involves more of a gritty, modern crime/action film format rather than comic book. Perhaps Nolan's greatest asset is his instinct when surrounding himself with top-notch, hardworking talent. Ledger's Joker is a revelation and funny/creepy as hell. Bale plays Wayne as even more of an ignorant prick to comic effect. The score is breathtaking. I for once wasn't longing to hear Danny Elfman's theme from the previous franchise. Everyone working on this movie is at the top of their game, except I'm not sure why Anthony Michael Hall is in this... The film is more than just dark. Batman has always been dark, but this story is devastating; it's pure tragedy. I'm reminded of the direction STAR WARS took with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I think Nolan's Batman deserves to be a classic trilogy/holy trinity as well. Nolan and Co. will definitely have their work cut out for them if they decide to continue on. DARK KNIGHT is a daunting film to top. It also stands very well on its own and leaves little clues as to where the story could go next. Everyone can weigh in their hopes and ideas. I'd like to see Catwoman worked in and 'Nolanized,' but I leave all those decisions to him; he's earned my complete trust.",10,2,6,22 July 2008
There Will Be Blood," your mom will hate this movie
","As a cinema junkie and Paul Thomas Anderson disciple, THERE WILL BE BLOOD was likely the most anticipated motion picture experience ofwell, my entire life (thus far). I read Upton Sinclair's OIL! in early 2007. Paul's decision to adapt a novel written in the 1920s had me pretty curious. It was a great read, a massive tale and educational as well, but it was hard to visualize it as a PT Anderson picture. I've never been much of a period movie guy myself. Sometimes, the period drama can end up being a filmmaker's wrong turn down a path of boredom. TWBB is Anderson's slowest picture yet, but it is far from boring. For me, the joy of watching it comes from the way the story takes its sweet time. We creep along as the plot slowly cooks away and seeps under your skin, into your subconscious. I've always felt Paul's films had a dreamlike quality, and TWBB is his most surreal film yet. I dreamt of it all night long after my first viewing. It was a strange feeling to wake up the next morning and realize I'd spent my slumber in Little Boston with Daniel Plainview. A movie has never had that effect on me before. TWBB is likely the most important, revolutionary, and all around best motion picture of this decade. Pretty much what PULP FICTION was for the 90s. How do I know this? Why do I feel this way? It's hard to put into words. I think you can watch the film and either you get it or you don't, and I'm not trying to be condescending when I say something like that. It doesn't mean you're a stupid idiot if you don't get it, but I do feel bad for you, because you're missing out on the great experience I've had, a completely original experience, and that's why it's challenging to write/talk about this film. There's really nothing to compare it to. It's an unprecedented work of art. I've honestly never seen anything like it. For all its uniqueness, it's not that far out there structurally. It follows the traditional, film school principle of the three act framework, and by breaking down TWBB into its three acts, it becomes clear that the heart of this epic tale revolves around the tragic story of a father and son. Act one is the dialogue free prologue. Daniel's character is introduced and fully formed without a single word spoken. People get hurt and killed in holes, and these incidents lock the rest of the movie in a constant state of dread. In one of my favorite scenes, Daniel attempts to calm a crying baby, and the baby is fantastic, best baby acting I've ever seen, and perhaps these scenes spilled out of Paul as he wrote, a result of his own new found role as 'Dad' (or maybe not. I imagine he might despise comments like that, and I don't blame him). The film moves into its second act with both Daniel's decision to keep the baby as his son and the jump forward in time about nine years. The first half of Act two builds and builds as this story of finding oil in Little Boston is set up. The halfway point of the film comes with HW's ear drums being blasted away by the pressure of an exploding oil well. Daniel makes the decision to send his son away, and it's all down hill from there. The story gets darker and darker, until finally, we jump ahead about 15 years to HW's wedding and the beginning of the third act, and oh, what a final act it is. I've already warned of spoilers, so I wouldn't feel too bad revealing the details, but I don't think there's much more to say about the end of this film other than it's hilarious, perplexing, and, well, perfect. As a lover of all things PTA, this film has once again reaffirmed that he's only capable of the greatest of cinematic accomplishments. Many say TWBB is nothing like other PTA works. I agree and disagree. Like all his films, it's an incredible experience and is at its best seen on the big screen with great sound quality. For how drastically different a direction TWBB is for Paul, I could also say it's a culmination of the rest of his career. The beginning is really just another version of the first scene of PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE. A man works alone, going back and forth from inside, in the darkness, to the outside, in the light. Jump to the ending, and we get another version of the grand finale from BOOGIE NIGHTS (Long Way Down). Like MAGNOLIA, the music of TWBB builds the momentum of the story. Like all of Paul's films, TWBB gets to the point where it overflows with nervous energy. He makes edge-of-your-seat, popcorn movies without resorting to butcher knifes and masks or machine guns and helicopters. The fun, quirky PTA dialogue is here too. 'So' 'so' 'so-sothis is what we do.' Maybe the one thing missing from TWBB, in comparison with Paul's other films, is a great female role. There are none, just a handful of bit parts, and there may have been more, but for some reason, great scenes in the script such as Daniel with a prostitute and another with a woman breast feeding baby HW were not included in the final film. One of my favorite PTA trademarks is his powerful closing images and lines with the final shot, the last five seconds of all his films: blood on the cuff of a killer is covered up, a large penis is finally revealed, she looks at us and smiles, she wraps her arms around him and says 'Here we go,' and he looks back and claims, 'I'm finished.'",10,1,8,25 January 2008
The Wrestler," The Rourke Show
","This film is the perfect document of the strange sport/theatric hybrid known as professional wrestling. Aronofsky's brutal exploration of the cultural phenomenon is his most mature work thus far. He's good at telling these stories of things going from bad to worse, but with this he's dropped his style-heavy inclinations and focuses in tight on the performances. I've heard Nicolas Cage and Stallone were considered for this role and I can't even imagine it. This is Rourke's movie. He owns it completely and is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, and that invisible line between actor and character just makes everything all the more painful to watch. I would not even be surprised to learn that Rourke really did take all those staples. The nasty violence actually gave me a bit of headache; that's how effective this movie can be. People with heart conditions beware.",9,0,1,20 January 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A fairytale for adults: $1 million solves all problems
","This is a great film, it pulses with life, music, and culture, but the majority of its greatness can be seen in the first hour. I tried my best to avoid the hype, maybe I waited too long, maybe I'm part of the 'backlash,' but I would like to think this would have been my reaction even if I'd seen it sooner. The first half has it all. Laugh-out-loud comedy becomes devastating tragedy leading to grand adventure all across India. It's magic, you are right there in the slums, the game show set, the train, but the illusion begins to wear off at about midpoint as things begins to flow, inevitably, toward an ending where everything will come together and be right. Stories can do this while still maintaining tension, and the finale of this film does have its tense moments, but it also loses a lot of steam. I get that it's a fairytale, and this is one of the great modern day fairy tales of our time, but it's hard to relate to characters when they are just purely good or evil for the sake of being one or the other. The only character who struggles with this dichotomy is the older brother, Salim. For this reason he's the most interesting character, because he's the only unpredictable character. I couldn't stand the game show host. He was on the evil side of things, but I'm not sure why. Ultimately, I wanted to see an ending that could equal its beginning, but it didn't hit me like I wanted it to. The guy and girl love one another just because they do, regardless of knowing whether or not they share any interests or actually get along over an extended period of time.",8,2,5,22 December 2008
Atonement," bite it. you have to bite it.
","I enjoyed the first act immensely. It all takes place in one day and is cinema in its finest form. Simple acts take on mythical qualities. The use of time and music gave energy to what would have otherwise felt to be a slow pace. I was especially a fan of the subtle, dark humor including the use of a naughty word I wouldn't have even thought to be in existence in the 1930s and a man telling a young girl to 'bite it. You have to bite it' (referring to the chocolate he's given her). Very funny moments, and in fact, both become pivotal to the story. The rest of the film is also pretty good, just not as much so as the first portion. I felt it became a bit too WWII clichéd at times. The casting of all the 'Briony' actresses was remarkable for likeness and talent, and all the performances and film-making were still spot on, but I found myself wanting more of the story. What happened during his prison time? I guess what was really missing for me was significant enough development of the romantic relationship. I didn't really believe they could truly be in love. I should also say I don't care too much for scenes in films that turn out to have not really happened. Still, the second half of the film had some powerful moments, and overall ATONEMENT is an excellent motion picture.",8,1,3,26 January 2008
