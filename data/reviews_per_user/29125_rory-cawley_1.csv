Blade Runner 2049," Boring disjointed story with visuals rehashed from original
","It was a mental sufferfest to watch this to the end. The original movie was exciting and flowed. This movie was all over the place, almost like there was a massive fight in the cutting room and what they ended up with was submitted to meet a deadline .I saw it in 3D as well but I found the visual fx were just OK. Nothing out of the ordinary.I'm wondering where they spent the money here. I would advise them to spend it on an expert story 'fixer' next time rather than release this tosh!In a word: awful.",1,56,120,8 October 2017
