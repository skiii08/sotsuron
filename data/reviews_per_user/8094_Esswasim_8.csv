Requiem for a Dream," Epic!
","The director of this movie deserves great applaud from all the movie fans out there, this movie is an art, the acting is so fantastic and real, the plot is so overwhelming, the music adds as an ingredient to leave you possessed in it, this is simply the best movie I have witnessed and have missed for 12 years, I am happy I watched this one, drug addicts need to watch this while not being high, and rest of us can know how lucky we are to stay away from drugs, this is surely entertainment but the message is clear and vivid, drugs will kill you in ways you never can imagine, you will be left in the lurch. Back to movie I recommend this movie to all of the people who want something to tease their mind and soul for at least few days, and there are few sexual moments in movie which can't be skipped either cuz they are integral part of this movie, that is not to arise your sexual desires but a message how drugs can destroy humans. I am speechless this movie moved me, I can't sleep tonight that seems to be its side effect, you will love the background music a loooooooot.",10,0,1,4 October 2012
The Expendables 2," Couldn't complete
","The few action movies that come to my mind hearing the word 'action' are The Matrix, Mission Impossible, plus something like Blood Diamond... But after I watched expendables it occurred to me as Garbage, now I watched about 45 mins of expendables 2 and it occurs to me as Trash. How could they go wrong so much experience in the cast and yet they are completely swimming in the pool filled with shittt of Simon West... This movie is not the food for brain it is for the lame. Yes some fans of the cast may like it due to their patriotism or fanship whatever you may call it, but those of you who like it, I am sorry guys but you are just as lame as the movie is. I can't even put it under the tag 'Movie' how can I? Or can I? Then when I play the game like crisis and complete it I can capture the game in my camera and watch it, and that would be a better movie. 45 mins that I could bear are minutes I wasted in this trash, and now I am writing this review just to save someone else from wasting his/her time watching this epic action disaster. I don't want to get into details of how I felt watching the first 45 mins all I can say is dumb cinema. I hope Simon west doesn't try another movie again. This is my plea to him. Just don't please don't ruin the cinema like this.",1,4,8,14 October 2012
Lone Survivor," Realistic?
","I have to admit that this movie tries to engage audience into vilifying the Taliban as a very amateur Army, but the truth is not so many Taliban fighters died in the real battle and it was almost like a one sided battle for Taliban and there was hardly any resistance according to sources of Taliban during this mission, people say this is realistic which I fail to understand because as far as I am concerned the US soldiers seemed to be robots that would fall the cliff over rocks get hit be tree trunks so hard that it would break any bones at the same time I don't see chances of survival in such falls, let alone everyone surviving during such falls, which is very unrealistic...It is also important to note how good the Aim of US soldiers was very sharp when they were in such pain and torment, shivering of fear, in reality the case is completely opposite, Taliban were shown to come out without any proper cover and understanding but just shooting and marching, but in reality the Taliban has undoubtedly beaten The US and NATO forces in every Stratagem of war, the casualties that Taliban takes is mainly because of Air Support, otherwise they are very strategic to take much less damage, and very sharp to inflict more damage.I don't see this as a realistic movie as I have seen some real fights of Taliban and US forces on Youtube which are more powerful and real and create the sense of understanding what a real encounter is like, it creates fear and certain atmosphere that is unmatchable that your heart starts pounding and every gunshot you hear creates certain vibrations in your heart. But I have to say this movie does however do justice to Hollywood standards which have been much more unrealistic usually but no we cannot call this movie realistic and it should be considered as fiction because there is lot of fiction involved.",5,3,12,19 January 2014
The Impossible," The shallow
","I saw the movie hoping to be some epic disaster movie filled with all the realities and harshness of the disasters but it turned out to be more like comedy, well some of the audience may not agree with me, simply becoz they just want to spend couple of hrs watching some story, it doesn't matter what happens, to be honest the movie is forgettable in minutes, becoz there not a single thing amazing about the movie, I won't go onto how it starts and how it ends and twists and tales, but I would say don't expect a masterpiece or grand movie, becoz it is just a movie that you can watch carelessly, nothing is intense, nothing is memorable, and maybe it lives upto it's name, the impossible, yes meeting your loved ones who are lost in a disaster is almost impossible and in this movie the director made sure they meet without much suffering as they happened to be on same street from the million streets in the country, impossible is achieved of course without even looking into records of patients, that is kinda stuff makes me lol...",4,1,7,18 February 2013
Argo," Not worthy of an Oscar.
","From the neutrals point of view this movie is average American suspense investigation thriller, I mean yes that is how good it is an average movie, for its direction and production and actors and their roles, an average movie, what makes this movie worse that it fails to develop characters and so we end up emotionally detached from the movie characters, there is nothing splendid about any roles, from the American patriots perspective, it is great since the hero rises when needed to pull of a fairly good stunt by deception with the aid of friendly Ally Canada, so in patriotic terms to see your country pulling off a here it is always delight to watch, and it doesn't matter how the actors did or how good the quality of movie is, so overlooking those aspects of movie, an American citizen loves it.From the Iranian perspective. The movie will be bitter taste in the mouth becoz, every Irani fella won't want it's security breached and nation losing the captives at a very crucial time in the revolution, which in fact didn't have much impact on the total development of Iranian revolution. but still this movie is made to remind them that American people can be clever..So to sum it up the movie still is overrated leave the event in history aside, leave patriotism aside and see how much you feel for characters from the perspective of a neutral, I am sorry but I have a feeling I didn't find any such development of characters to give this movie a rating of 8, I give it 6 for not including any bizarre moments...",6,4,7,5 February 2013
Logan," Like any typical linear action based drama
","Some say it is a masterpiece, if it is a master piece what was Godfather? I know the genre is different, but every genre has to achieve that high bar in order to be called masterpiece, so anyone who says it is a masterpiece has no idea of how a masterpiece looks like.Many said it is depressing, again I felt it is not at all depressing, it is a very simple script, very linear ,no twists, no mysteries, sometimes funny, just the bad guys chasing a mutant girl who is being protected by Logan. Everything else around are to spice up this very linear moments in the life of decaying wolverine. If you are thinking this is a movie that you will remember after even like a week and miss, then you are wrong. This movie is worth watching one time, just one time. But is it necessary movie that I will say you should watch this before you die kind of movie? Not at all. You can miss out on this one and you will miss nothing important in life. I give it rating of 6 because I have seem better and more deep movies which kept me thing hours after watching the movie rated less than 7. So 6 is a good rating for this movie. Now why is it rated 8 or more? I have no clue how IMDb works who comes and reviews these movies, it got a 8 because I suppose it is Wolverine. Wolverine is a character already developed, new characters in the movie had no emotional influence on me at all including the girl. If I think deeply about that I will rate it less than 6 but I am just gonna be generous and keep my 6 rating.Thank you.",6,12,26,29 April 2017
3 Idiots," Idiotic
","I heard about this movie from friends in office and outside and everyone wanted me to watch it even though I am not a fan of bollywood movies but the expectations were set high and finally after couple of years of thinking I decided to watch this movie, well it starts with what I can say is Cliché filled Bull Shiiit, I mean there is no attention to any detail paid in this movie, it is like a work done without Post production, personally I feel it is for people who just don't go into details and just want to have a stupid laugh, yeah maybe for them it is a good movie, but for people who crave for movies which provide near realistic experience , please stay away from this crap, as this is nowhere near that standard, I just was shocked to see the first scene, but I thought, well this is bollywood such things are normal, it can only get better, But damn then the college scenes nothing but boring and lame clichés, I felt wtf after 45 minutes and stopped the movie.Some might say oh wow, reviewing a movie which I watched only 45 minutes, well yes that is because I couldn't stand it or more, thank you very much for your pathetic try to entertain me. Every detail matters not just the theme they are bragging about. Movie experience should be complete 3 idiots is very idiotic as if made by some idiots.",1,15,55,11 November 2013
Pitch Perfect," 48 mins 59 seconds
","Yes 48 mins 59 seconds is what I am about to review, there are movies which I can't complete due to total annoyance they cause and make me wanna scream 'what the hell is going on' ? And that is what this movie did to me in mins I watched it. I love musicals like Sweeney Todd, Mamma Mia but this one is just the nightmarish type, I feel so bad i just don't know if it was the stupidest movie mins I ever watched.People who want to see good acting roles, some standard emotions, some class, are advised to stay away from this awful creation. What are those junkies doing the characters in the movie are total junkies I don't get it, it is such a nonsense, such a waste of time and money, such a bad feeling, pitch perfect is the dumbest movie I ever seen in my life and this day is my sad day that my wasted mins are adding up due to fact I am forced to review this title. Sensible people should stay away from this movie, that is my suggestion, if you got no taste go ahead and watch it...",1,12,28,15 December 2012
