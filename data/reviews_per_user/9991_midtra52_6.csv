The Hangover," It didn't do it for me
","Not only did I think this movie was awful, but most of my family did too. We thought it was completely awful, and didn't laugh once. I even tried to force myself to laugh, of funny there's a tiger in the hotel room, wait that's not funny, or is it? But the odd thing about this movie is other people I know thought it was hilarious. I watched it on my own so I'm confused about what parts others found funny. I guess what this movie lacks for me is wittiness, it's more of scenic humor possibly. I don't know how else to explain it because quite honestly I'm confused and just wish I hadn't watched it. I'd like to hear someone that understands what makes people laugh explain why it is that this movie gets so many laughs from some but none from others.",1,48,88,18 May 2010
Captain Marvel," Confusing to say the least
",You don't know who is the good character and who is the bad. I went to see this with my niece and after seeing captain Marvel act like a rude self centered you know what for quite some time she asks me if she is the bad guy of the movie. I just answered 'I think so. It's confusing isn't it?'. Needless to say none of us really liked it. I sure wouldn't take young girls to see it as it either really confuses them or teaches them to act like they have antisocial personality disorder.,2,18,28,30 May 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Good story, well made, unfortunately unethical and distortionist
","I have always liked Spike Lee as a director. He makes great movies as far as I'm concerned and I liked this one because it was historical and even though it was over dramatized at times, it was still based on true events. It has some great comedy that mixed in with a serious situation as well. Even at times when the scenes were intense it could be funny. The real shame it all is how Spike Lee added these edited clips of Trump at the end to present the idea that Trump is a racist. It's a shame to lie about people and take things out of context to try to ruin someone at the end of what was otherwise a really good film. It just ruined it for me. Present factual information or keep quiet.",6,6,14,25 December 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Doesn't compare to the original
","The most important thing I can say is, just see the original Swedish movie. This one doesn't provide the same feeling as the original at all. Everything down to the score for the film is off. They aren't as clear when telling the story in this version either. Rooney, while learning the mannerisms and portraying Lisbeth to the best of her abilities just simply doesn't have the right look at all. She looks like a soft small child playing dress up rather than a worn abused yet tough young woman that Noomi Rapace portrays so well. Noomi has the sharp angular features that give her a tough serious look while Rooney is softer and sweeter looking. I probably won't watch the other U.S. versions once they come out. The Swedish version told the story right, created the environment for the story, and provided the feeling that made the movies so great.",4,9,15,21 June 2012
The Fountain," Great movie it just needed more length and more clarity
","This was a very creative and entertaining way to describe love, life, and death, but the movie in my opinion was too short and needed a little more narrative. Many people that have seen the movie complained that there was no narrative, but there was definitely a narrative, it's just that at times it was too vague. The other issue is that in some of the scenes they whisper so quietly you can't hear a word that's said. The story and the ideas put into this movie are really fantastic though. You will have to pay attention and definitely turn the volume up when they whisper, which is quite often. Also realize the narrative isn't complete and much of it is left to your own interpretation. My main complaint is that they left too much up to interpretation and that left the movie feeling incomplete. That said, I still give this movie a 7 because it still comes across pretty well.",7,0,3,6 May 2012
Get Him to the Greek," So little laughs made it seem so long
","The main problem is the main character, he's just not funny at all. I had seen him in other movies as a random sideshow and sometimes he's slightly funny in those cases but still more corny than anything.Oddly enough Kanye West or P diddy or whoever that was did provide some laughs. I can't tell them apart because they both do the same dumb things to try and act cool (like wearing sunglasses indoors at night). But he was funny and did a good job acting hypertensive and crazy.Jonah Hill is normally a really funny guy when given the right role, but in this case he has to try to make something off his interactions with the main character which is hard to do when Russel Brand just brings nothing to the movie for him to work with. It wasn't a good role for Jonah Hill.The movie does have quite a few cameos that I guess they hoped would engage the viewers more, but I was so annoyed and disappointed by the lack of comedy that I just didn't care.",1,4,11,21 May 2011
