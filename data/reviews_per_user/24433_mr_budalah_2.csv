Sucker Punch," awful
","I'm sick and tired of wasting my time watching garbage because of reviewers on IMDb have gone soft... Lately, meaning last two years or so, except for a few titles like 'Shutter Island', 'Inception', 'The King's speech'etc., that have met the expectations, because of some real great professionals were involved, there was a ton of shitty films. I think... I HOPE! it's because of the financial crisis that turns even artists into money hungry cons.This is one film that could've, should've revitalized the industry but failed to do so because of greedy director, producer, etc... Dude, you don't mix heavy drama, psychological tension, sexy teenagers, sci-fi, tons of cgi, and constant action, together in a big pot and hope that because of the fact that you used all the best and most expensive ingredients you'll get a smashing result! It is Crap! better of with a low budget-good plot movie. It is too much, and instead of getting our attention, it bored us, too much of everything for almost none strong backbone plot... 'Punisher 3' would have been far better, I would have enjoyed it more, no matter how cheesy it would have been...'Sucker Punch', in my opinion is a big screw up. P.S.: Thought that baby doll girls with head drama would fantasize something that wouldn't involve heavy guns, monsters, swordplay, Nazis, dragons, orcs, mechanized samurai, robots, mechs, zombies, etc... I'm almost sure I missed something... That is only a boy's sweet dream. I think that both the producer, and director, woke up all wet and hard one day, and decided to put their wet dreams into a movie.I recommend this sort of action-fantasy-drama-psychological-horror-thriller flick, to twisted teenage horny boys who enjoyed 'sailor moon' with napkins instead of popcorn...",1,167,345,27 March 2011
Interstellar," Time, will see this movie stand it's test and remain in the top.
","I saw this movie twice. Once at the cinema and once at home.And let me say that I considered this to be the kind that you only see once. Because it is a powerful movie that relies on feelings to get the message through, not on action - that you can look at again and again, from time to time, to pass the time... when you have the time. :) I was able to enjoy it a second time, and breathlessly I might add, because the first time I was just a man belonging to a woman, and the second time, now, I was, am, the father of a 2 years old daughter. Throughout the entire movie I had lots of moments when I felt the need to look upon my daughter who was sleeping peacefully next to me. I felt a connection, that's how good Nolan is. Cooper's lines (involving his daughter) are convincing, that's how an educated man would treat his daughter, he is believable. Now, I don't emphasize on the father-daughter drama in the movie because I consider it to be the central piece - it is not - it is the perfect catalyst for the delivery of the powerful and most complicated theories of relativity and space-time; important messages about the dangers that our frail world faces and also the will and potential of mankind to overcome those dangers and flourish beyond them. Combined with some astonishing visuals, strong music and a very realistic, down-to-earth futuristic design and tech, and given the fact that I think that science fiction is the ultimate kind of art :) I think 'Interstellar' is the most awesome piece of cinematography that I have laid my eyes upon. The repeating use of 'time' is intended ;)",10,2,4,8 June 2017
