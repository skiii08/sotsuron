The Devil's Advocate," Could have been great
","This is a frustrating movie, in my opinion. You can tell that it has potential of being a truly great movie; the basic theme, several plot twists, the casting and the costumes and sets all point in direction of a 'classic'.But I think it falls short, and it does so because of a few flaws that needn't have been there. I've read praise of Al Pacino's performance in earlier comments, but I think it's one of the major problems. He's given completely free reins, and in fact must have been encouraged to go all out. And so he does, with obvious pleasure. The end result is overblown, overstated, crude, lacking in nuance. He laughs like the devil and smiles like the devil... over and over... adding nothing to the character after the initial impression. There is no growth in Milton's character, or in Pacino's handling of it.This is the second problem - the Milton part is badly written. It contains long, literary and completely artificial monologues on the state of the world, that doesn't work at all on the screen. No person, not even the devil, talks like that. You lose interest, because the basic direction of the monologue is clear from the beginning, even though it goes on for another 30 seconds.Putting these two problems together and I think that you have a bit of a turkey inside an otherwise very interesting movie.Of course, Pacino is great in the movie when he works with small gestures, and the Milton part is sometimes intriguing -- a fine example of the RIGHT combination of the two is in the subway scene with the two hispanic hoodlums. I wish there would have been more of that and less loud, maniac monologues. Oh, and that false teeth prosthetic looks really strange on Pacino... in some scenes he looks like a real doofus. Weird.Keanu Reeves was very good (as he sometimes is), as is Charlize Theron. The movie has lots of clever ideas and memorable scenes. It's also pretty unpleasant. I like the triple ending, though I can see how people may feel ripped off.Could have been truly great. Too bad. I gave it a 7 / 10.",7,0,1,7 October 2002
Constantine," Good one for genre fans
","I really liked 'Constantine'. I think it was a worthy addition to the Daemonology genre, kicked off by the Exorcist and Omen back in the 1970s. These movies often promise a lot, but too often fall apart due to poor internal logics, failure of realization, or just plain old cheesiness. 'Constantine' evolved along a clear narrative path, where all characters had a certain consistent part in the storyline, yet still surprised here and there. The Daemon & Occult motif was well done, bringing in the typical paraphernalia in a working way.In addition, it was a delight to see Peter Stormare as the big L, a match made in heaven. Keanu Reeves was solid as always in his stone-face non-acting 'Neo' style.I gave Constantine an '8'; I think it was clearly above average for the genre.",8,11,17,26 January 2006
American Psycho," Not as good as the novel, but still...
","*** Some minor spoilers below ***I'm a great fan of Ellis' novel, which I recently re-read, and after seeing the movie adaptation for a 2nd time recently, here are some thoughts.The movie's main problem is that it seems to lack a bit of self-confidence; both in direction and script. It does seem to want to take Ellis' labyrinthine, non-linear (except for sheer chronology) work and turn it into a 'normal' 90-minute movie with a beginning, middle & end. Yet it doesn't go all the way there either, which would have required substantial overhaul of the whole storyline and characters. Instead it's a middle route that selects choice material from the novel, and expands some angles to create a narrative arch -- the latter being most obvious in the much expanded part for Detective Kimball, vs the novel where his part barely exists. Unfortunately, Bateman's psychological complex is so vast that it cannot be squeezed into a story about a psychopath scared of getting caught.While Ellis never fully explains what Bateman is about, he says so much about him in the novel that you feel that it's as close as we're going to get. In the movie OTOH, Bateman is still enigmatic, but with a feel of simplification. On the first view I remember thinking that the movie was too short, and that it had been brutally edited, but on the 2nd time round I see it more as an effect of the choice made for the presentation of Bateman. It may work better if you haven't read the novel, but I doubt it.OK, on the plus side: Christian Bale does a terrific job, with lots of work put into it. He has developed a whole set of deliberately artificial faces which help illustrate the emptiness of Bateman's inner life. His voice is terrific, and manages to convey contempt and hate even while the face is looking jovial. He's good in the 'horror' segments too, truly primitive and more real, as he should be. Very good casting, and an excellent, unusual performance.The clothes, the hairstyles, the restaurants etc, all look much like they appear in Ellis' novel. I miss the hilarious rundowns of what people are wearing (the single most notable feature of the novel on the first read), but they look right and it's no great loss. Bale in particular is extremely well dressed, even for a 'Wall Street' movie, like he should be. His apartment, and Owen's/Allen's look just right too.One case where I think the movie is *superior* to the novel is in the portrayal of Bateman's female friends, Evelyn and Courtney. In the novel they never become more than shadow creatures, interchangeable despite appearing on many dozens of pages. Thanks to great casting and well-written parts, both Reese Witherspoon and Samanta Mathis manage to give these rich-but-messed up ladies true identities. Bateman's secretary's part is much like the novel, though I think Chloe Sevigny overacts slightly in her mousiness. Another element where the movie may surpass the novel is near the end at the club, where Bateman confronts the lawyer with his confession -- this is a scene that works better as film than literature, and the movie exploits it brilliantly. Some more complaints: the Kimball cop-hunt angle doesn't really work as stated above, and I also think the gay love angle of Luis Carruthers (which is pretty effective in the novel) becomes meaningless in this drastically shortened version. The part with Christie being chased and having a chainsaw dropped on her is NOT in the novel, and seems wrong for Bateman, who thrives on physical *closeness* to his victims -- this was a real mistake in the script, IMO, esp in such a crucial scene.All over, the movie is complex and challenging, just like the novel, which is obviously very difficult to adapt. I don't think it holds a candle to Ellis' work, but I still enjoy seeing it. The second half in particular is strong, with the director finding her stride and Bale's carefully developed Bateman fitting in just right.",8,2,5,22 September 2004
Resident Evil," Why get so sloppy?
","I was really disappointed with this movie, which had a pretty good reputation and 'buzz' upon release. It started out well, but about 30 minutes into it a feeling of cheesiness came creeping over me. There were just too much illogical behavior, sloppy acting and derivative ideas that the original promise fell apart. This continued throughout the movie, so that towards the end I pretty much hated it.Some nice visual touches and an interesting premise, but all the movies it rips off -- Aliens, the Romero zombie trilogy, Outbreak, The Relic, etc -- are better than this, which adds to the exploitation feeling. The lead characters are unsympathetic or incomprehensible, and given no support by the weak actors.This movie follows the exact same pattern and weaknesses as Anderson's 'Event Horizon', which however suffered less from its problems.",3,0,0,6 February 2006
28 Days Later...," Good genre movie that could have been better
","It's interesting to see how popular a movie can get despite being derivative to the extreme. I guess this simply means that not enough people have yet seen George Romero's zombie trilogy, or classic British apocalypse TV such as Day Of The Triffids or the mid-70s 'The Survivors'. Making a good genre movie doesn't simply mean patching together all the familiar elements of the genre; you have to add a new twist or a new aesthetic to it. I can't say that '28 Days Later' does any of this.The first 1/3rd of the movie is excellent, gaining strength from the predictable yet very spooky images of a London completely empty from people. Cillian Murphy immediately wins the viewers sympathy, and carries the whole movie in a way that the director & writer should be quite grateful for. Unfortunately I think there is a slackening of pace and narrative grip in the middle third, which is the encounter and northbound car journey with another couple of survivors. The two female roles aren't properly developed, and I personally think the actors can't match Murphy & Gleeson... it really does feel like an old TV series here, briefly.The last third is very uneven; it covers familiar territory while making some interesting points; the direction is alternately confused and inspired, and there is a definite weakening from insufficient exposition of the soldiers as group and individuals. A lot is asked from the viewer here, and it seemed sloppy and B-movie like, compared to the first third.Basically, the movie tries to combine two powerful (yet familiar) themes into one, and a proper balance is not achieved. A different editing of the storyline would probably have improved things, but ultimately it is a case of a well-known and thus predictable story, whose first hour or so still works well thanks to atmosphere and acting, which cannot maintain its strength until the end. All in all, I was a little disappointed, but still found the movie worth watching.",7,1,2,22 October 2007
Black Hawk Down," pure war movie excels
","I just saw this for the first time and found it engaging and impressive, although with little of depth or originality. It is an old-school war movie of the type that have gotten in vogue again, where comradeship and battle action are the main things. The movie is essentially one long battle sequence, and as such it's pretty outstanding. The editing and the sets are extraordinary, reminiscent of the last 1/3rd of 'Full Metal Jacket' or the first 10 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan'. Big cities and structures shot to pieces make for excellent cinema, although the direction does border on a computer game-like showpiece at times. There were some strong scenes involving dying soldiers, not terribly original but effective in the context.The first thing I had to check out was who played 'Hoot', and it turned out to be Eric Bana who I didn't recognize. His character and performance is the best thing in the movie, apart from the superb action scenes. Great screen presence, and also a thankful role as the cool uber-soldier. I can't say I think Ewen McGregor's part worked, except as comic relief. Josh Hartnett was OK, but seemed a bit underdeveloped. Tom Sizemore, Jason Isaacs and William Fichtner are *always* a delight to see, and I admire the casting department that brought in these charismatic supporting actors into the same movie.Racist? Well, if I was Somalian I wouldn't have appreciated this movie. But, it's an old-school war movie, so it goes with the territory.I gave it a 7 / 10, for a couple of very specific reasons only, detailed above.",8,1,2,18 October 2004
Cube," The good, the mediocre, and the very bad
","'Cube' has gained a sizable cult reputation, and I was pretty curious when I finally got to see it now, in 2008. Although I expected a certain amount of rough edges from its indie/low-budget background, I have to say the edges were rougher than I expected. There is a giant chasm between what is good about this movie, and what is bad about it. Personally I can handle movies that are 'wrong' in some ways, if they have other things going for it. 'Lawnmower Man' is an example of a movie where viewer forgiveness may go to such extents that the movie becomes enjoyable. 'Cube', unfortunately, didn't pass this threshold with me.To summarize my thoughts, top-down:1. the basic premise of the movie is excellent, as is the set design 2. on a synopsis level, it's still pretty good, though some aspects (like the 'Rain Man' type character) look contrived 3. on a script/chain of events level, it's decent, and explores the basic premise well. The complete lack of character exposition is problematic though. 4. on a script/DIALOGUE level, I think it's pretty damn weak, and the acting makes this problem worse.I don't think I've seen a promising movie with such awful dialogue in a long time. The characters, trapped in a hostile environment, start hating each other after about 2 minutes. Idiotic, and bizarrely lacking in psychological realism. And those lofty philosophical exchanges about society, responsibility, existence and so on -- which the characters launch into as if someone had suddenly pressed a button on their backs? If you want to insist on metaphors, why not use your brains and be elegant and original about it?The actors didn't help much. The 'cop' guy lost all credibility after an OK start, but the female doctor was beyond belief from the first minute. I'm not sure the actors are to blame, as much as the director... but they sure didn't help.I wasn't very impressed with 'Saw' (the first one), but 'Cube' made that one look like 'The Shining'. This movie should be re-made with a completely rewritten dialogue, strong actors, and a much improved opening and ending. Too bad.",6,5,9,2 May 2008
