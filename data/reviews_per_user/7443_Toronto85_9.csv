Gremlins," Gremlins
","Gremlins is a interesting little film about small little monsters terrorizing a small town. The movie starts with a man who buys a little mogwai pet named Gizmo from an older gentleman in Chinatown for his son Billy (Zach Galligan). There are three rules when it comes to Gizmo. You can't feed it after midnight, it can't be exposed to bright light/sunlight, and most importantly do not let it get wet. If Gizmo gets wet, many little 'gremlins' will pop out of it's back. Of course Billy doesn't follow the rules at all. All hell breaks loose in the town right on Christmas Eve of all nights. Billy and his girlfriend Kate (Pheobe Cates) must stop the little creatures before they destroy everything and everyone.The movie is well done with it's effects. The little gremlins looks and seem like real live monsters. And Gizmo is the cutest thing on film I've ever seen. The scenes where the Gremlins are watching Snow White in the movie theatre is pure comedic gold! They even sing along to 'hi ho hi ho, it's off to work we go'. But, that's near the end of the film. There are many slow parts throughout. The police don't believe Billy when he tells them monsters are attacking the town. And it gets annoying watching him break all of the rules that must be followed with a pet mogwai.Zach Galligan and Pheobe Cates are two of my all time favourite '80's' younger actors. They both play the lead characters. I think that at times Gremlins takes itself way to serious and that's a difference from this one and the sequel. It's a movie about little monsters terrorizing a town. The second one pokes fun at the plot. I haven't seen 'Gremlins 2: The New Batch' in years, but I remember preferring that one to this.Still it's a must see movie for all.7/10",Null,1,2,9 March 2011
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of the Dead
","Dawn of the Dead tells the tale of zombies attacking a group of human survivors who take refuge inside a large shopping center. This is of course the remake to the amazing 1978 film by George A. Romero. While it has it's moments, this remake fails to match or surpass that original for a few reasons. Anyways, the movie begins with the world BEFORE the zombie invasion. We meet our 'main' character Ana who is coming home from a shift at the hospital. She goes to bed with her husband and then is awoken to a little girl standing in the hallway. Yes, she is a zombie. It is a very tense and creepy opening scene. That's when the excitement begins and Ana takes herself to safety at the mall.Other than the fact that it's a zombie film and it's location is inside of a large shopping mall, the Dawn of the Dead remake is very different from the original (which I liked a lot). This one had a much bigger budget and a more well known cast, but wasn't as good as the 1978 version. It's a good movie but failed to surpass the original. I HATE the fact that zombies can run, it takes away from the eerie moments we witnessed in the original 'Dead' films. Them running does add some intensity to a few scenes, but it just isn't the same as the 1978 version.'Dawn of the Dead (2004)' does have some creepy moments, and of course has gore galore. But it doesn't have the same charm the original had. This should be seen by all horror/zombie fans as it is a good entry to the genre.6/10",6,0,0,7 July 2013
Home Alone," Home Alone
","An eight year old boy is left home alone at Christmas when his family leave for a France vacation, not realizing he isn't on the plane with them. Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief.The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the 'Wet Bandits'. Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv.All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round. This should be seen by everyone at least once.8/10",8,9,10,17 December 2012
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Home Alone 2: Lost in New York
","Home Alone 2 picks up a year after the original film in which the McCallister family accidentally left young Kevin alone to battle two criminals at Christmastime. It's Christmas again, and the family have planned another vacation. They don't leave Kevin home alone this time. A mix up at the airport sends the family to France and Kevin to New York...ALONE! Luckily for Kevin, he has his father's credit card which he uses to check himself into the luxurious Grand Hotel. From that point on, Kevin must battle the hotel management staff who believe he stole the credit card he used, as well as a return from the Wet Bandits! Harry and Marv are back and Kevin has a whole new set of tricks and traps that batter the crooks yet again. I really like Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, it matches up pretty well to the first film. Macaulay Culkin does his thing as Kevin, the little boy who finds inner strength during moments of terror. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious again as the bumbling idiot criminals. O'Hara and Heard are back as the parents who have some funny moments as well, and Tim Curry/Rob Schneider/Dana Ivey add much to the film as the hotel staff. The abundance of characters really works for this movie, they each add an important part to it. Home Alone 2 obviously breaks away from the 'home alone' idea. Kevin isn't at home he is in a giant city. There is however a good chunk of film time spent at an abandoned house in which Kevin sets up his attack against the 'Wet Bandits'.Home Alone 2 should be seen by everyone in my opinion. It isn't your average Christmas movie, but it does take place at that time in New York City. There are some great location shots at Rockefeller Centre and Central Park. There are also many heartwarming moments between Kevin and a homeless woman he meets in the park. I liked it a lot!8/10",8,2,3,18 December 2012
Psycho," Psycho
","Psycho is probably my all time favourite horror film next to Halloween (1978) and the original Night of the Living Dead. What this movie managed to do at that time in the 60's was remarkable. There had never been anything like this made up to that point. It's the start of a great sub genre known as the 'slasher film'. The story is of a troubled man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and a woman on the run named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Marion leads an unfulfilled life and one day decides to embezzle $40,000 from her employer. While on the run, she stops off at the infamous Bates Motel to think things over and get some rest. While taking a shower, an unseen assailant who resembles a large woman attacks her with a knife, killing her. We soon are led to believe it's Norman's mother who committed the crime. It's then we see Norman cover it up for her. Many people question the whereabouts of Marion over the next few days including her boyfriend and sister. They, with the help of a private investigator, discover she was at the Bates Motel. But when entering the house up on the hill behind the motel, the discovery they make is much more chilling then could ever be imagined.Psycho is an all time classic by suspense and psychological icon Alfred Hitchcock. This was definitely his best work. The Birds was also excellent as was Rear Window, but this will always be his best known piece - and for good reason. The performances by Perkins and Leigh in particular was very understated and very well done. Watching it the first time, you really are drawn into the story and the mystery of the crimes taking place. Of course, after a few viewings you know the plot and the killer's identity. This is one of those horror movies that never gets old to me and never feels boring. Each time I watch it, I pick up something new. I liked Janet Leigh's character and her struggle with the embezzlement scheme. She knows what she did was wrong and contemplates taking the money back numerous times. It gives her that human quality and makes viewers feel bad for her in the end.The musical score is legendary as well, even if you've never seen Psycho, you know that sharp grating music that goes along with each suspenseful moment. Psycho is a classic horror film, but not just horror. Even the people who hate horror should see this at least once for it's brilliance.10/10",10,1,2,12 April 2011
The Conjuring," The Conjuring
","It's possession galore for the Perron family in 'The Conjuring'. The film for the most part takes place in 1971 and that's we meet the Perrons, a nice all American type family with a couple and their five daughters. They move into a house which is basically possessed and is haunted. It's all okay at first until the family dog dies, and then some doors start opening on their own, and finally some of the teenage daughters begin to feel a demonic presence in the house at night trying to get at them. They call the Ed and Lorraine Warren for help, a couple who investigate paranormal activity. Eventually we discover some history of the people who lived in that house over the years, and the terrible things that went on in the house. Can the investigators save the Perron family from being possessed completely, or will it all end in tragedy?'The Conjuring' is a chilling horror movie, and it uses many different things then what we are used to seeing in recent horror flicks. Mirrors and shadowy figures and creaking doors opening are used to create fright, instead of blood and guts and over the top jump scares. Great direction by James Wan, this film had a 'Dead Silence' feel to it (that was also directed by Wan). I liked the background story of the people who lived in the house before, although I wish it would've been explored more. What I didn't like about this was the exorcism parts. I just felt like it was sort of ripping off of 'The Exorcist', and it fell a bit flat and was a little silly. Any demonic possession movie will get that comparison. The special effects and make up for it was well done though! Acting was good all around, in particular from Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor. 'The Conjuring' is basically 'The Amityville Horror' meets 'The Exorcist', with a few more scares. Some of the scenes late at night with the kids being basically stalked by the ghosts were genuinely scary, I thought it was really well done. I'd check this out!8/10",8,0,2,21 July 2013
Halloween," Halloween
","'Halloween' is that slasher flick we all initially heard of that has the killer in the white mask who stalks the babysitters on Halloween. It is the best slasher/horror film out there, because it mixes suspense and fear yet does so without so much blood. Gore is necessary in some horror movies, it can make up for lack of story/plot/excitement. Halloween didn't need any of that to be successful. The story goes that young Michael Myers killed his older sister as a child on Halloween, stabbing her to death. Fifteen years later to the day, he escapes the mental institution he was in (under the care of Dr. Loomis) and begins stalking Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). He follows her around at her school, follows her and her friends when they're walking home, all leading up to Halloween night when the murder and mayhem begin.So many awesome things about this original Halloween, from the music to the big chase scene at the end between Michael and Laurie. I loved that it took place on Halloween, and we see the trick or treaters and the jack-o-lanterns. Great atmosphere. The body count is pretty low in this one, but when a murder happens John Carpenter makes it count. It's always dark and you never know when he's going to pop out at his victim. The white mask he wears works wonderfully as well. Acting was pretty good all around from PJ Soles to Nancy Loomis to Donald Pleasence to of course Jamie Lee Curtis. Halloween should be seen by every movie fan, not just horror.10/10 - A perfect horror film",10,0,1,25 June 2013
Carrie," Carrie
","A shy young girl gets back at her high school bullies using telekinetic powers in 'Carrie'. Carrie White is graduating high school, yet has no one to take her to the prom. She has no friends and all of the girls at school pick on her constantly. On top of all that, her mother is a religious nut who emotionally and physically abuses her at home. After picking on Carrie, fellow classmate Sue Snell decides to make it up to her by having her own boyfriend Tommy ask Carrie to the prom. After much reluctance, Tommy asks her out and they head off for the big night. The bullies fix it so that Tommy/Carrie are picked as king and queen in order for pig's blood to land right on the poor girl. That's when Carrie loses control and all HELL breaks loose at the high school.'Carrie' is an amazing fantasy/horror film. Director Brian De Palma does such a good job with 'Carrie'. We get the flashes of the magical prom mixed in with Kris planning to dump the pig's blood over Carrie. The plot of the shy girl getting back at her bullies is a satisfying one, but with the added idea of telekinesis makes an even more exciting movie. The acting was really well done by everyone! Sissy Spacek puts in a good job as the lead Carrie, Piper Laurie is convincing as Carrie's crazed religious mother, and I REALLY thought Amy Irving was wonderful as Sue Snell. John Travolta, PJ Soles and Nancy Allen were great too as the villains. All around, a really good cast.It's always fun to see bullies get theirs in movies, but 'Carrie' takes it up a notch. I'd recommend this for sure to every horror fan. It's well acted, got a great cast and tells a pretty satisfying but sad story.8/10",8,1,1,6 July 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Nightmare on Elm Street
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is a refreshing and imaginative scary movie by a master of horror; Wes Craven. This first Nightmare is probably the darkest of the series. Freddy has some witty one liners in this, but it isn't full on comedy like we see in Nightmare 3-6. The story is about a group of teenagers who are having nightmares about a burned man that is trying to kill them. The man is Freddy Krueger and years ago he killed many of the children on Elm Street in a town called Springwood. After the police let him go the parents gathered and killed him, burning him alive. Now he has found a way to exact his revenge on the parents. He can kill their other children in their dreams. After her friend Tina is murdered in her sleep by the evil madman, Nancy must find out the town secret and stop Freddy from killing all of the teenagers in Springwood.There are some things about this movie that don't make sense. The ending is the big thing that stands out. Did the mother die or not, what was with her being sucked into that mattress? And the ending in general was pretty weak. But the rest of the film is brilliant. The acting is very good, of course Johnny Depp stars in his first movie. And Heather Langenkamp does a strong job in the role of the survivor - Nancy Thompson. Wes Craven created a horror icon in Freddy Krueger that has lasted many many decades. A Nightmare on Elm Steet is the one that started it all. It isn't the horror comedy that the recent Nightmares have been, definitely the scariest of the series. A must watch.9/10",9,0,1,21 March 2011
