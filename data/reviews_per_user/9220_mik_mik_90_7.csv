The Avengers," Assemble!
","Who wouldn't be thrilled to see Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Thor and the rest of the gang in flesh and bones on a film for the very first time? well maybe not all but for what its worth I was one of those who would be willing to do anything just to watch it because the waiting was the worst part.Not a fan of either Captain America or Iron Man but I was satisfied with the movie given the fact that the Avengers was gradually taking shape starting from The Incredible Hulk (the one staring Edward Norton), to Iron Man 1 & 2 and up to Captain America and Thor. It was a long journey but the end justify the means and it was epic! it was awesome!",10,2,5,14 August 2014
Fight Club," The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club.
","Fight Club earns itself as one of my all-time favorite movies. I don't know where to start but I guess the reason why I love this movie is that I know how a routine could be lethal in your life. For me this movie is beyond entertainment, it's more of a wake up call. Consumerism, Narcissism and having the wrong concept of success; we as human beings craves so much of these that we forget what's the true meaning of life or what it felt to be truly alive or so they say. We became prisoners of these ideas that the only reason we work is just to buy something that we thought would make us happy and in process it's sucking out our life of us.Sometimes I guess we all need a Tyler Durden; of not giving a damn about those propaganda's that the society dictates us to be or says we needed. However,we are still living in a civilized world so it is best to keep your Tyler Durden on leash. We don't want anybody to end up in jail now, do we? and for what's its worth, I think that Fight Club shows us that sometimes our own true enemy is ourselves, it is just a matter of to be or not to be. Moving on, I am also a fan of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter and I think they're great actors, actually I've been hunting lately their movies to watch. And of course there's Brad Pitt so I guess the main casts was great not to mention some of the supporting actors such as Meatloaf and Jared Leto.Overall, I enjoyed watching this darkly-humored movie and I was glad that I did! two thumbs up!",10,0,1,11 August 2014
The Maze Runner," We've got a Runner!
","If you ain't scared, you ain't human.As a fan of The Maze Runner series I got to say that there are many changes in the movie which I think is necessary because of course you'll notice that usually movies runs from 1 up to 2 hours long only...so what do you expect? (this is actually for those whiners who didn't have a clue) Besides I think that those changes makes the maze and the Grievers (a bio-mechanic monster) much more dangerous.Main Casts was actually great for me. I'm familiar with Thomas Sangster (Newt), Will Poulter (Gally), Kaya Scodelario (Teresa) and Patricia Clarkson (Ava Paige) since I have seen their other movies before. Dylan O'Brien (Thomas) though was new to me, I've heard that his from Teen Wolf which I don't watch, but I was actually surprise with his acting performance in this film, it actually pretty good. Another newcomer is Ki-Hong Lee plays Minho which until now I don't know whose famous scientist he was named from. The movie experience as a whole was incredible, it was heart- pumping and wicked! I am already excited for second installment The Scorch Trial because that is craziest part of the series besides I would love to see those Cranks in horde too.And if you guys saw the film but didn't read the book, I think you should read it.",10,16,37,18 September 2014
Thor: Ragnarok," For an MCU movie, this is Thor-lerable
","Maybe I am the most boring human being in the world for not laughing in this movie. Hell, others would hate me for it. But for the record, I would like say that I really enjoy the MCU ever since The Incredible Hulk back in 2008. I do like the humor of MCU and I also enjoyed Taika Waititi's 'What We Do in the Shadows' and 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' but this Thor: Ragnarok just didn't work for me. I think the set/props and some CGI part looks fake, I kinda zoned out when they were in Sakaar because it was too caricature for me. That planet didn't feel authentic, from the costume design to the set, it was almost a sitcom level to me, a high-budgeted sitcom. The main problem for me is the fact that this is a comedy movie first before a superhero movie. The humor in this movie is really really predictable, like MCU humor predictable. So I've seen it all coming. What I like about this movie though is Cate Blanchett's Hela, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Story wise I think it was interesting, I mean I finished the whole film but I was not satisfied with the finished product. Maybe I am just having a superhero fatigue after almost a decade of following MCU. I don't know. But I am pumped up for the next chapter which is the Black Panther.",5,1,4,31 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Not Bunch of A-Holes
","I was not actually a hardcore fan of comics, though i know some stuffs about superheroes that an average human being does not know. With GotG though, I know little about the character's origin but i think my main concern about the movie is that given the fact that they're all bunch of misfits, liars, thieves and thugs. I think that in the movie they have given their trust to each other that easily for a small span of time. I mean of course this was just a movie and movies usually runs from 1 to 2 hours only. So what the do I expect? but I guess my point is that I did not see that deeper connection or bond within the characters. Overall though, I think that this movie is all fun and mayhem and oldies but goodies music. It was less explosive than The Avengers but it was still good.",8,5,9,11 August 2014
Up," Never Been So Wrong
","Up is one of my favorite Animated movie from Disney/Pixar of all-time, actually that list is getting longer, keep surprising me Disney. This movie is like a comfort-food for me, a feel-good movie, perfect to watch on lazy weekend.I remember the first time it showed its trailer in theaters, I get skeptical about it. A grumpy elderly man, a chubby Asian boy, talking dogs, a flying house up in the air tied up with hundreds if not thousands of balloons, in a one big adventure? For some reason I thought that these might not work because it's too random for me but it is seems interesting though and it's Disney! I doubted other movies that they've created before for the same reason, such as Finding Nemo, Wall-e and Brave which turns-out to be really great. Obviously I did love this film that's why I have rated it 10! It was funny, heart-warming and visually stunning. 20 to 50 years from now, I would love sit one day on a couch and watch this movie again.",10,0,2,14 August 2014
Incredibles 2," An Incredibly 14 Long Years of Waiting for Incredibles 2
","The Incredibles is definitely one of my favorite Disney/Pixar movies. The first movie came out 14 years ago and 14 years ago I was still in my first year of high school and watched it more than I can count and I've wanted so much more of it. Over the years I was hoping that they would make the second movie already since other Disney/Pixar movies such as Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. already got either their sequels or prequel. And I thought that it was unfair that studio still has no plans for a second installment of The Incredibles, until 2014 when it was announced that The Incredibles 2 is in works. I was excited about the second movie but another 4 years of waiting is just a lot of time...and so I waited...Now that I watched The Incredibles 2, Disney and Pixar should announce the part 3 already and I don't want it in the next 14 years, I want it next year. I even got goosebumps (I know!) in the first part of the film picking up exactly as to where the first movie left, and it made me feel as if it was like yesterday. It brings back so many good memories of my life back when I was 14 years younger and damn it made me feel older. As for the story, I think that The Incredible 2 focuses more on the characters and fleshing them out in a way that we have not seen in the first movie such as Jack-Jack which is a delight to watch and Frozone with his relationship with the Parr family. They also included a bunch of new characters both supers and humans. Surprisingly though, Mr. Incredible was left out of action and stayed home to take care of the kids but what made me realize is that this movie is a perfect film to watch on Fathers Day. Mr. Incredibles relationship with the kids, especially with Violet's boy problem and Dash's math homework, made me appreciate him even more as a character and as a father. So, I thought it was an odd choice at first to release The Incredibles 2 in June but now that I saw the movie I think it was a great move because of Fathers Day especially now that some of those kids who saw the first film 14 years ago could be/or a father now. Too bad though that they did not use it in their marketing strategy or maybe I was not just paying attention. As for Elastigirl, I was skeptical at first when I saw the trailer and that they just basically move the spotlight from Mr. Incredible to Elastigirl. And that Disney/Pixar are just riding the badass woman bandwagon that we have in movies, tv, and books these days. I'm not against it but I think that it is important that these characters were not there because they're a woman, or because they're sexy, or because it's a trend but I think it should be more than that, they should also possess certain qualities of what it takes to be a hero or give them some ideology, a push and a reason as to why we're having these stories in the first place. And to be fair with Elastigirl though, I think that it totally made sense as to why she was put on the spotlight, she has the least collateral damage to make than Frozone and Mr. Incredible when fighting a crime, and that either her or Mr. Incredible needed a job in order to get out of the motel that their family are staying. The movie also has some great visual action scenes. I was never a fan of Mr. Fantistic from Fantastic 4 but I think it was a missed opportunity for previous Fantastic 4 movies to showcase such great power set on screen because of Elastigirl is really rocking it and made me change my mind about elasticity as an awesome superpower to have. She was a fusion of Mr. Fantastic and Spiderman and it was really amazing to see her on screen swinging on buildings fighting crimes and chasing the Screenslaver. Overall, It was really a fun movie! I just think that when you watch too much Disney/Pixar movies you'll kinda predict what's going to happen but still, 14 years of waiting was worth it. I am excited to watch this movie again and again.",9,1,3,16 June 2018
