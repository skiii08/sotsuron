Captain Phillips," What's next for Tom?
","Is there nothing Tom Hanks can't pull off?Yet again, a stellar performance by Tom. He's proved yet again that he is up for just about any role thrown at him.And lets not detract from the Somali Pirates! Amazing and oh-so realistic performance! These guys are a group I'd hate to meet out in the middle of the ocean!Don't research the true story until you've watched the movie. There's many that are critical of the Captain and his actions. Watch the movie. Enjoy it. Then research the real event and even read the Captain's book and then form your own opinion. (Unfortunately I kept wondering if the Captain did what was portrayed in the movie because I'd read up about the event prior....)",Null,1,1,22 January 2014
The Equalizer," Man on Fire Just Came Of Age!
","Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!I LOVED Man on Fire but this takes it to a whole new level! There's no doubt that you need to read between the lines and piece a few things together, but overall a great movie. Denzel still has it, even as he ages. He played the dark horse really well (and again, in similar vane to Man on Fire, he clearly has a past that is unknown to his friends).Chloe played a role years beyond her age- another outstanding performer with a great future ahead of her.Whilst some might complain about the level of violence, I wouldn't say it's as bad or worse than many other movies out there now.If you liked Man on Fire, you'll like this....",9,0,5,14 December 2014
Deepwater Horizon," Good but don't go looking for the whole truth
","This is a good movie, but don't watch it thinking for a minute that you're gonna go get the whole story, or the full truth.This disaster is way more complicated in terms of the lead up to the event- attitudes toward safety, cost cutting, the roles of each company in the whole story and so on.Having said that, the concern I had with a movie such as this, is that it might glorify or glamorize the event. Whilst it's definitely got the Hollywood spin, I think it's been done well.The special FX are awesome and totally believable. The acting is good- it's not Oscar nomination stuff, but it's good overall.If you're looking for an action flick with a difference, then this is for you. If you're looking for a documentary that's gonna give you insight to a disaster such as this, then this is not for you.",8,3,5,29 December 2016
John Wick," Action hero has a new name!
","Action hero has anew name and his name is John Wick! This is a definite surprise movie for me- I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.Keanu has been out of the limelight for a while, but what an epic come back in my eyes. I can't help but think back to Bill and Ted days! (This is a far cry from those days!!!!) The long and short of it is that John Wick seeks revenge for the killing of his loved ones. Not original in idea, but still a good movie.Great action scenes, lot's of fighting, gun battles, twists and other stuff to make it what it is.If you like action movies, get it and watch it!",9,7,16,1 February 2015
Lone Survivor," Wow!
","Wow! Wow! Wow!What a movie. What a story.I'd read the book some time ago and generally find adaption to be really poor cross overs however Lone Survivor was incredibly well done.Great action scenes, great acting, great cinematography, great soundtrack. Mark Wahlberg has excelled yet again- his acting is really growing on me and he's shaping up to be a favourite and must see. Having said that, I can't detract from the others either- they all handled this movie really well.This movie ticks every box for me especially given that it's based on real life experiences.",9,1,6,21 February 2014
Rush," Great movie!
","From start to finish, this movie had me hooked!Loved it.A great storyline which many will know about in a round-about sort of way.This movie gives a great insight into the world of F1 racing, though it is almost laughable to look at the cars then, to what is being driven today. There's just no comparison in terms of technology, advancements in engineering an design and other factors.The acting was superb from both main characters.Strongly recommend this to any fan of racing, or just looking for a good movie overall...",9,1,1,11 January 2014
Nightcrawler," Hard to rate
","I've struggled to rate this one as I try to separate my own experiences from what was portrayed in the movie.By way of background, I have over 16 years with the emergency services and have seen my share of Stringers. Most are really good to deal with and know what their limitations are, respect our job and don't cause issues or get in the way.This relationship ends up being a win-win as we often allowed them better access to scenes and at times allowed them to record extra stuff for our benefit knowing that they wouldn't use the footage (more so because the networks wouldn't or couldn't anyway due to the graphic nature of the footage).However, on the other hand you have the occasional Stringer who would do anything to be the shot, would disregard instructions and get in the way constantly, which in turn distracted people from doing their job. The good thing though was this was rare.When I watched this movie, I was taken back to a few of my own experiences in dealing with Stringers and it got my blood boiling as I though of how they conducted themselves.Thus my dilemma in rating this movie.I've tried to put aside my bias towards the minority and rate this purely as a movie- on that, I've got to give it a good rating as I thought it was well done, it was realistic, it was confronting.It also made me wonder how many Stringers would actually go as far as he did to get the perfect shot? Would the shot take precedence over everything else? Hope not, but don't know.",8,1,1,16 February 2015
Gone Girl," More twists than an extreme roller coaster!
","Jeepers! I didn't see that coming!This movie has more twists than you can imagine. Despite the many negative reviews I went ahead and watched this, though I must admit it took me two tries before I got right through it in one hit.It was well worth it.I wanted throttle Ben for his actions and things he was doing throughout the movie. He played his character so frustratingly well!Rosamund was exceptional- saw a different side to her and again, really enjoyed it. She played an amazingly twisted character, and played it well!It's a long movie, but well worth the effort and time to watch.....",9,1,5,16 February 2015
