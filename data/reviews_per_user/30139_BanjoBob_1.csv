Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace? No, no -- Power Rangers!
","This movie can be summed up in two words:Major DisappointmentSure, the special effects were impressive.  Bravo, Lucasfilm, you can still make the best special effects in the business.  Pat yourselves on the back.But part of the charm of Star Wars was the character development and the story line --Neither of which seemed to get any attention at all from Mr. Lucas.When acting is consistently poor throughout a movie, especially from seasoned actors like McGregor and Neeson, it is the Director's fault, and the script's fault.Don't blame the actors--blame Lucas.I actually felt embarrassed for good ol' George while I watched the movie. I kept hoping, 'Please, get better, please get better.'The puppetry of Jim Henson was also missed tremendously.  The characters (particularly the Trade Federation's Viceroy, etc.) looked like they came straight out of Power Rangers. I actually cringed every time they came on screen.Darth Maul was also a big letdown.  No character development whatsoever.Please, George, we love your vision, we love the story, but PLEASE, let someone else direct the next two!PLEASE!",4,0,1,21 May 1999
