The Blair Witch Project," Learn as little as possible.
",Do yourself a favor and don't read any reviews or anything about this film. BUT SEE THE MOVIE.  This is by far the best movie I have seen in a long time.  It is also the most frightening movie I have ever seen.  I will not give any plot info or any info about this film. See it and you will understand.,10,1,2,31 July 1999
The Matrix," Don't see the movie if you have seen the preview.
","The movie doesn't get any better than the scenes in the preview and those aren't that good if the first place.  One of the most overrated movies in a long time, and that includes both totally overrated Austin Powers movies. Keanu still can't act and putting him in a role where he is supposed to be smart is an absolute joke.  Watch Dark City, it is a much better film.",2,1,5,27 January 2000
The Matrix," Overrated and overhyped.
","If you saw the previews, you saw the movie.  I was not impressed at all by this film.  It can't compare to Dark City which was a much better film. Keannu still can't act to save his life.  The ending was lame.  ' True Love' bringing back Keannu from the dead?  Pure Garbage.  A serious waste of money in making this film.",2,1,5,5 January 2000
