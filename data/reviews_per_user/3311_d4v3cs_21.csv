Requiem for a Dream," this is sick...this is sick....this is..
","uh...this is the first movie ever that I completely understand when one completely hates it with 0 out of 10, or like it with 10 out of 10...personally, I myself can't feel since there's just too many contradictions in me after watching this movie...however, after seeing scene after scene...there's one word that makes the movie 'alive'...the SCORE!!!
lots of Kubrick movie is 'sick' enough, but it doesn't come close to this...even I spit on your grave, last house on the left, and death warrant are just like a walk in the park....this is sick..this is sick...this is....real..HELPPP MEEE!!!!",Null,0,0,9 August 2002
The Ring," wheee
","gee, I've given up horror/thriller flick since the genre is becoming worse and worse. Ones that can pick it up were what lies beneath (so so), 6th sense (not scary, touching instead...oh boy), bone daddy (only 1st 20 min), house on....
SPOILER unlike all those movies, the ring makes you let your guard down and then attack you with full strength. I have to admit I'm biased regarding the scare factor, death people in an abandoned well climbing out was my childhodd nightmare. I was watching the DVD with friends at 1am in a stormy night when we thought, good for Samara, her soul can finally rest in peace...when boo final scene...The movement of a body seems to lose its muscle support after rotting is just excellent. What scares me more is the fact that I can't help but smiling at every gore/deformed scenes (even making jokes that people die because they watch TV too close)...except the last one. It gives me creep for days. Blair Witch Project has 'the unknown is the scariest thing' since no ghost etc has actually ever shown. Scary, but no images to linger in your head as a result. I feel bad for the actress playing Samara, she's supposedly little beautiful actress etc, but now when I see her photo, I can't help but to feel the creeps...oh well, at least she's a good actress thenDarn this movie, good thing it's TV, if it's a computer monitor that I face 24/7.....",Null,0,0,8 March 2003
Se7en," beware
","this is no horror movie...this is a statement of a sick and how sick a society can be...which is sadly where nowadays society is going to/throughthis particular movie has particular atmosphere...ever since that subway vandalism related to the money train movie, I am almost certain this movie will produce its own copy cat of some sortbe aware...",10,0,0,14 February 2002
Spider-Man 2," it's Kiki Delivery Service!!!!!
","this might contain itsy bistsy spoiler. I STRONGLY recommend this movie. Parents, you want your kids to see this movie. It has a relevant and wonderful moral. Even if you're ultra-conservatives, this movie has much less objectionable content than the comicNow, the review. We got our heroine/hero, it's a 'growing-up' movie, hero/heroine lose self confidence/identity, lose power, shock comes causing hero/heroine to finally understand true self identity, hero/heroine gain power back and saves the day. But truly, even though Miyazaki & Ghibli are great with plot and character development, Spiderman 2 is superior for it's more relevant and closer to home (it's at home actually) OK, maybe it's not Kiki afterall. As already mentioned by others, this movie is EXCELLENT, which means the plot is believable, great character development, choice of soundtrack, flawless special effect, believable villain, some humor, and a righteous message. Unlike blade, hulk, daredevil, etc, our Spiderman is just like our everyday ordinary guy, making it very easy for the audience to relate to his struggle, confusion, and resolution. We follow and feel along as Peter learns he has a choice afterall, and finally receives his aunt powerful message. 'To be right, sometime we must give up what we want, even our dreams,' how true, there's a hero inside all of us.Now if I can just hope for the best IMHO, please, please, Venom on Spiderman 3 (Venom can take goblin out in the first 20 min) and keep Tobey in. I'm not sure if the movie could cover Venom storyline like the comic, but after seeing Spidey 1 and 2, I'm rest assured it'd be just great.With great power, comes great responsibility",10,0,0,3 July 2004
Finding Nemo," Dory, a fish 'with a heart of gold'
","IMHO, Disney/Pixar has finally come up to the standard of film making of Japanese (especially Ghibli) animation which draws nothing but admiration from the viewer. Finding Nemo got them all: beautiful artwork that makes me feel like watching Spirited Away & Final Fantasy combined, and such a likable character with compassion, kindness, gentleness, and charity as in Kiki Delivery Service.With that lovely character design alone, I would have like this movie so very much. But Pixar really raise the standards up this time. EXCELLENT JOB! I sure want to know if the Pixar people can say something they think they fail to achieve in Finding Nemo.On initial watching, I couldn't help but to think with all constant action and excitement, the movie is trying to keep the young audience from getting bored. However, as the movie progress to its end, I realized how wrong I was. The constant action is a genuine part of what makes this movie purely enjoyable: 1.Instead of trying to imitate from Ghibli animation and probably come up with some superficial deep theme, it stays loyal to cinematic style of continuous excitement as in Monster Inc 2.It follows the initial plot hint; 'the ocean is not a safe place'Having something beautiful thrown (or presented) at me, I started to compare movies. I noticed some potential inspirational scenes from Spirited Away (intro of theme with title shown, same closing scene etc)& other Ghibli films. Also came to think of how one is deeper than the other, although it has so much unfamiliar/weird ideas and so on. However, I finally got to a level of change of attitude. I stopped comparing and/or putting these profound work of art in ranks.It's futile trying to put those works in ranks. They simply reach deep within, and such is a unique, wonderful, and heart warming experience; Finding Nemo, Majo no Takkyubin, Whisper of the Heart, Only Yesterday, Porco Rosso, Totoro, Spirited Away...the list grows",10,0,2,21 August 2003
LÃ©on: The Professional," unique
","this is a perfect character...unlike other movie where the hitman/hero;willis, stallone etc smoke, get laid, curse, and expose all....this one is differentthis one is 'the professional' the only negative quality is the unfortunate job as an assasin, but inside; the compassion and charity are never endingThat look in the movie theater actually shows the innocence alreadyI hate the paedophilia impressionate scenes but overall, this movie is the BEST in its genreWATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,1,20 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," very nostalgic
","this is good , very good... after being reluctant to see the movie for a year, I finally checked it out. Same feeling I got as when I was small and watched willow and dragonslayer. Now I know how to test whether a movie would be an enjoyment or not, as in Lord of the Rings, I listened to the sountrack first, the very companion of a movie's spirit. When that soundtrack 'clicks,' I rush to see the movie.No silly romantic stories, adult content/scenes etc, definitely a gem. This movie deserves all awards...I'm really tempted to give 10/10",Null,0,0,5 October 2002
Cast Away," tear jerker
","This is one of the saddest theme I've ever seen on TV. I usually give comments at parts of film, but during the last scenes I was speechless. To lose someone, have that someone in your heart always, strive to be with that someone again...just to lose her all over again....unimaginable...",10,0,0,29 January 2002
Edward Scissorhands," profoundly gorgeous
","This is quality of dream. I watched this more than 5 years ago and now just listening Danny Elfman soundtrack, the images reappear, the bittersweet melancholy is still there. The snow scene in the end, I couldn't help but to think Edward's spending immortality by himself, only accompanied by lingering memory.This movie is so perfect to me since I can relate to both Edward and Kim character, where my favourite scene is where Edward in a calm yet hurting voice said; 'goodbye'",Null,0,0,2 February 2003
Spirited Away," careful with the dub version
","I was in line today for spirited away and got into a brief talk with a family over the movie. I told a lady I've watched the subbed version and was about to check the dubbed one. Then she said; 'you mean the dumb version??' We all had a good laugh Well, having said that, the dubbed version clearly add/modify some line to suit the US audience better, particulary in the comedy aspect (you'll find the dubbed version funnier than the subbed) However, it CHANGES some important points in the storyline SPOILER one obvious example is: in the dubbed version it's mentioned that Haku is a river spirit in the ending dialogue with Sen..what the?!??!?!??!?! That almost spoil the entire flashback scene meaning. Oh well, I won't start pinpointing what's the meaning of all this....hope they do better next time.Get the dub/sub DVD and decide for yourselves",10,2,3,2 November 2002
Spirited Away," most horror movie I ever watch.....or not
","this movie scares me to bits... Damn, it reminds me of my childhood nightmares and dark imagination everytime I went to an amusement park, that after the sun sets, the place would turn into a dark dimension with horrible and hideous creatures. Also a certain tunnel that leads to another horrible places full with disfigured creatures, ghouls and goblins. This movie brought it EXACTLY like how it was in back then. Geez... now I can't even eat much anymore...buekkhhhhapart from that...uh. I can't give any praise. Instead I'll just say what I feel, this is the most mixed emotion movie I ever watched...also the most weird. It seems like the movie 'babe' went wrong at first. As the movie progress, I started to see the true innovative art behind it. This is the first movie ever where I'm unable whatsoever to guess what happens next. I watched it straight after mononoke, I can't help but to wonder why there's always blobish/tentacles thing in his movies.
Now the strange thing is how I relate so much to the mask man and Migihayami Kohakunushi, barely unexplainable.At last, as always, it's the soundtrack, the spirit companion of a movie, the single tool that let its images linger in your mind and memory.",10,2,3,7 October 2002
Spirited Away," in addition...
","I would like to add as well that the movie is unique in terms that it does not utilize 'fan service' and male anime fan taste in its character creation. No pretty boys, kawaii girls, or even immodest appearance like the major anime series who exploits anime fan (mainly male) common taste and the director/writer's own libido. Hayao Miyazaki certainly has a class of his own. Expect to find more details as you watch the movie more than once.",10,0,1,8 October 2002
Saving Private Ryan," life
","I watched the movie again and still felt the powerful feeling from it.After watching the movie, bloody FPS PC games are really nothing, in fact I have lost all the pleasant sensation of power from shooting, cause it's just madness.The movie is so great not because of the American patriotism/pride shown in it., but the message of 'life' and greatest love; that is for one/ones to die for the sake of others",10,0,1,25 June 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," dangerous...
","if you're not prepared to be haunted by a film, don't watch this It's been a week and images still appear in my head, tickling my tear gland. Now I truly realize that both knowing and seeing should be present at the same time in order to see the big picture. We all know people die, mother/father/children die in war, but seeing how they die...that's a different story.SPOILER I disagree with most opinion that says pride cause the suffering. In the translation pride was mentioned indeed. However, what little Setsuko knows about pride? she only know how to cry at night when she long for her mother, and what would Seita do, silence her everytime she cry in order not to upset his aunt?. Setsuko wants to leave, Seita has no choice since he wants his little sister to be happy. There could be pride issue for sure, but it's not dominant whatsoever. Seems they made a tragic choice, but do they have a choice afterall?",10,5,6,2 November 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," I shouldn't have watched this...
","it's 2 am now and I'm still trembling...the last scene of Seita looking at the audience and than looking out to what seems to be the current modern Japan city under the hill with skyscraper is just haunting..I didn't see this as the Japanese suffering, for my family had their share of torture during Japanese colonialization era although the gift of forgiveness had taken care of that. Instead, these are children in war, wherever they may be
darn, it turns my state of heart upside down, completely cleared up all the smiles, joys, and nostalgic memories I got after watching Spirited Away.This movie reminds me of a reason I've forgotten, that is why at some point I'd turned to be a completely pacifist that I didn't even defend myself in the presence of serious harm from others. I was looking at myself as a coward, dumb etc, until I'm reminded that once I decided to hurt others with a reason of defense, one day (who knows?)I would declare war for the same reason, and I'd be the one causing these human beings to suffer.How in the world in this movie not in the top 250???? or as a matter of fact, in the top 10 next to Schindler's List???? Well, if 'too depressing' is the answer, I'd still be satisfiedI did go with 10/10 for it...but again, shouldn't have watched this...shouldn't have watched this...shouldn't have watched this...",10,2,3,28 October 2002
Grave of the Fireflies," why oh why
","watching the movie more than once will show you little details, sometimes funny details which unbelievably makes it even more depressing for you know what await beyond all the laughters.I can't help but to ponder why Setsuko and Seita are not shown in the end with their mother and father just like in the family picture. That would have helped reducing the pain/depression/trauma, you name it. Watch at your own risk.In the end, I would say like what other user mentioned; Setsuko and Seita are with their parents now.",10,0,1,2 November 2002
Black Hawk Down," cliccheeee.....
","This movie reminds me a lot of we were soldiers....just about a soldier get shot or wounded, you would have guessed it...then it's the whole 'tell my wife I love her'(in WWS) and 'tell I fought a good fight' Man, there's a point where I actually get bored... Could have brought more surprise if I watch it when I was 18 or before SPR If I reflect to the reality and occurences in the incident, I can say it's nice, but for it being a movie...oh well....a 6",6,0,0,16 August 2002
Castle in the Sky," Disney does learn...
","This is the best dub I've ever heard by Disney, as well as the best adaptation since the biggest abuse ever on soundtrack, themes, characters, dialogues in Kiki Delivery Service. UrrrghhhThis one has different atmosphere, especially the deviation from the common heroine. This one has both hero and heroine (although I don't really endorse the use of hero & heroine here, since Miyazaki is out from the stereotype & common theme). As usual, after being introduced by Spirited away, amazed by Mononoke, troubled by Grave of Fireflies, and deeply touched by Majo no Takkyuubin , this one start with a bit doubt in my part. Wondering if this will be the first Ghibi's dud. Well, in the end just like Only Yesterday and Whisper of the Heart, I ended up giving 10 rating. I'd give 9.8 rating, but the additional 0.2 is there to share the good feeling by encouraging people to see the movie.SPOILER Somehow I see this as a sad movie, people die in this one, the lonely robot, the abandoned place, and it ends with destruction. It is as if mankind really can't live with too much power. The collapsing scene gave me patches of Metropolis ending. It's just sad somehow. The plot is apparent in most reviews and the soundtrack rules as well (as always). Joe Hisaishi really belongs to Uematsu, Kanno, Williams caliber.People who can brings a movie, a game, an event to life, even to be a lingering moments by astounding composition.This is a feel good movie that used to be part of US cinema in the classic days (It's a Wonderful Life etc etc). Well, things change....",10,2,3,5 July 2003
The Green Mile," disturbing.....
","this is too disturbing, I can't keep thinking of why John killed wild Bill.....things can be done instead to clear his name.......oh dear...Then Tom Hanks given talents that enables him to be 'immortal' Immortal and see all your loved ones and friends die one by one......I can't even imagine that...too sad I got a stomach acheThis movie is so sad.....I felt almost the same as when I was watching Schindler's List...I still regret it when this movie was out, I watch the Beach with a dear friend instead of Green Mile...what a total wasteThis movie is near perfect 9.9999999 to ~ out of 10.....and I hope nothing in real life should ever happen like this.....just too disturbing",9,0,1,8 December 2001
AmÃ©lie," moving...
","This movie felt like a perfect escape from real world at first, but as the end approached, I was brought back to reality.The character is pretty much realistic, for I'm very close to one who lives in dreams. However, sometimes reality just put its face back in front of you.Although I despise every scene of nudity and sexual reference (but I have the highest respect for the fact that some are of screen), the movie have beautiful scenery, outstanding and unique music, nice comedy-drama-romance composition, and moving moments.Can't help but to relate with the character Amelie, who looks like Love Hina's Mutsumi in real life.Movie like this doesn't come around very often. Sure wish to pass by real Emilies",Null,0,2,19 October 2002
The Sixth Sense," quite absurd...astounding ending
","the idea of the movie is quite lame and old. the development and partition of the story is rather 'weak'I was laughing at the 'grandmother took the pendant' scene, now that's funny and non sense at the same timeThe last willis scene kept me quiet for the next few hours...'why did you leave me'...now that's scaringly newthat's enough to cause an 8/10",8,0,1,19 February 2002
