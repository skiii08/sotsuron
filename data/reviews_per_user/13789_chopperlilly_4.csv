Skyfall," One of the worst movies of this millennium
","Oh my God - where do I start? WHERE DO I START? Look, I never expected this movie to be realistic, but I did not expect it to be so unbelievable that I thought I was watching a cartoon - made with real actors. I mean I nearly turned it off when that villain talk out half his reconstructed face with this hand. WTF??Oh and the $5 billion dollars in damage this idiot causes? He should have been fired not praised! And what was the point of the stupid thing? THERE WAS NO POINT!! No point at all! Not one! UGH! I will be scarred for the entire week after watching this hideous, ridiculous, joke of a movie! AWFUL, JUST BL00DY AWFUL!I see some people have given it 8 or more stars. ARE YOU RETARDED?",1,10,19,14 September 2013
This Is the End," Didn't expect to like it....but.....
","...I did! Usually I hate these type of movies and anything with stoners in it usually makes me turn it off (cool with the other drugs though). But actually quite enjoyed This Is the End (although it could have been a little bit shorter). Jizz conversation between Franco & whatshisname was one of the funniest scenes in a movie that I can remember. James Franco was gorgeous as usual - and great acting too. Seth rocked it as well. Is this an insight into how 30 something actors live? If so, I want to join! Sounds like heaven to me. Hollywood - take me there! Without giving away anything ....Backstreet Boys was the best scene ever (you'll know what I mean when you watch it).Nice one James & Seth! h",8,1,5,29 March 2014
Man of Steel," Wiping this movie from my memory!
","It is not a Superman movie! It is nothing more than an expensive overblown reproduction of Independence Day. I thought I was watching a movie about the greatest super hero of all time, but instead I end up watching a movie about aliens!! And why, why couldn't the casting director find an actress like Margot Kidder to play Lois? Is it really that hard? Twice now, in Superman Returns and now in Man of Steel Lois is played by some pathetic weakarsed blonde woman with a girly voice. THAT'S NOT LOIS! If you want to see the real Lois watch the 1978 version!Anyway.....I got so bored that by the end I started to fast forward the scenes. What an f'n disappointment...I'm just going to pretend I never saw this..... The three stars I give are for Henry Cavill, who would have been a good superman if given a half decent script and co-star.",3,3,6,16 November 2013
The Descent," The Stupidity, oh the stupidity!
","Throughout this whole movie myself and my flatmate just could not get over the stupidity of six girls flying to the other side of the world, in the middle of winter, to explore a dangerous cave. Yes a cave. Is that some people's idea of a vacation? Who are these people? CAn I meet them and pick their brains? Yes I realise it was Juno who took them to the wrong cave, but why didn't the others start raising questions the moment they realised their ar$es couldn't fit through the tunnels? If you came to a tunnel with a narrowing so small you knew you couldn't crawl through their comfortably why would you continue? Wouldn't that be the moment you say 'let's go back now.' I don't know.....I just couldn't wrap my head around why anyone would go caving for fun. Or to get over the death of your family. To me, getting my fingernails plucked out with tweezers would be more fun than that. Seriously every ten minutes I would turn to my flatmate and say 'HOW CAN ANYONE BE SO STUPID?' Sorry just can't get past that.......",5,1,3,9 June 2014
