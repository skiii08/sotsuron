The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," You don't even have to see the movie to know what it's about
","It's the same movie all over again. The trailer was the only thing new, and that was basically the whole movie. Jacob takes off his shirt, with the same look on his face, the runs to Bella. Edward is basically a bad husband (And actor). Everyone thinks he just wants to protect Bella, but no, he just wants to control her. And Bella is the worst of them all, she's like a goth that can't act. This whole movie was just a bore, the trailer was the most action in the whole thing. I don't understand why people actually like this series. And my biggest thing about the movie is that, the were in the sun the whole time, but none of the vampires even minded. At least make one of them say 'Dang, it's hot out here' or something. Plus, aren't they suppose to glisten when they are in the sun or something? Well guess what, that's a big flaw in the movie because they didn't. The biggest blood sucker of the series are the writers, because they managed to do the same movie in four different ways.",1,26,51,18 November 2011
Inglourious Basterds," This movie could had been one of the greats
","One of the only movies I've seen about Nazi's, but not about Hitler. Well... it kind of is, but he isn't one of the main characters. This movie is basically about a group, called the 'Inglorious Bastards' trying to kill Hitler and the gang to end the war. Mean while a Jewish survivor has a plan to burn the theater Hitler will be watching a movie in, to avenge her family.I really liked the plot, and MOST of the actors were good in their role. At times though, I felt as if they were trying to act too funny. The music they chose wasn't a big help either. Like when Also, I hated when they did those slow motion scenes, the people looked foolish. The ending would have been great if not for the music.It had everything you need to make a great movie. Good actors, a good plot, humor, and suspense. But in the end the little anoyances became one huge one.",Null,1,2,21 August 2011
