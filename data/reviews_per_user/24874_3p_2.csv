The Hangover," really original
","I can't figure out if reviews and ratings of this movie are plain marketing or am I getting too old. Most original comedy of year and so on and so on my ass. Story is is simple as it gets: Four guys go to Vegas, get drunk and stoned which makes them really cool and one of them even marries a stripper. And that's about it. Yeah people. Far out. This MUST be #hundredandsomething movie of all times. Since I have seen few recommendations before watching it, I kept waiting for THE moment, it would really start being really good. Regrettably, it goes mostly down from the tiger on. Well, movie is not completely bad and can make make a fun evening out with your (preferably) male friends, preferably after a beer or two, in normal circumstances i would give it 6 or 7, but since a have to balance a little for all that nonsense, it gets five from me.",5,2,8,16 June 2009
Being John Malkovich," overrated
","Sorry. But I'm another among people who can't understand what's so great about this movie. I am a kind of sci-fi/fantasy fan, but if this movie is sci-fi, it's crap. Ideas are neither consistent nor explained or believable. Why does person have to enter 'vessel' before certain time? What happens if more people enter same 'vessel'? Etc. Add main characters' love affairs and you get an artsy version of contemporary soap opera. Nice to watch, relax, eat pop-corn while it's on, but nothing more. :] 6/10. And I'm very generous.",7,3,8,23 July 2001
