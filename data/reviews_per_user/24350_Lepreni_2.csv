Marie Antoinette," A Pretty Film. A Cop Out.
",Artistic. Nice to look at. The ending is a complete cop out. There is far too much nudity without anyone being naked. There is hardly any dialog. It's much less a story than it is an unfortunate series of events featuring mostly silent obstinate people.I love Sofia Coppla's style. I love the way all of her films look. They are aesthetically pleasing. This one is a cop out.Without the guillotine it is nothing.Not a complete series of events.The acting is solid.It's pretty.Blah blah blah blah.,4,5,7,21 October 2006
Knocked Up," Great comedy, great for a comedy..what did you expect?
","Some people love to review movies like this and say 'oh, the plot was too basic, the characters were all so clich√©, the humor was gross and crude, I am disgusted, the target audience is blah blah blah.' Those people are idiots. 'Knocked Up' is a modern mainstream comedy. In a world of 37 'Scary Movies' and the like, it is a refreshing comedy. much better than 'Talladega Nights', I would even say funnier than '40 Year Old Virgin'. But it is in the exact same style as any of the other Frat Pack movies, maybe a little more crude and maybe with a storyline that is a little more serious. No one went to see '40 Year Old Virgin' for character development or dramatic arc. Go see it, you will laugh and enjoy yourself.",9,6,13,1 June 2007
