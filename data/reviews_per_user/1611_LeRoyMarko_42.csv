Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Just don't call it the best comedy of all-time
","Borat is funny. But to say it's one of the best comedy of our time or even of the last few years is just over the top. And I just don't buy the argument that this is a great movie because of the social commentary it makes. Please! We learn nothing that we didn't already know about the extent of the bigotry of some or the stupidity of others. But again, Borat is funny. Put your brain in neutral and just enjoy. Don't get influence by the fact that you could be the victim of the guy's antics. The movie is slightly above average, but you've got to be in the mood to see it.

Requiem for a Dream," Very disturbing
","What about this movie? It's excellent! Doesn't happen to often that a movie disturbs you like this one. Ellen Burstyn's role is capital to the success of the movie, it shows us that addictions are not confine to young persons dealing with drug or alcohol. Burstyn and Leto both give a five stars performance, so as Jennifer Connelly. I remember her from her first movie, Once Upon a Time in America, back in 1984, where she was playing the beautiful Deborah. Back then, she was 13, I was 12, and I was in love with her! Her performance in Requiem for a Dream is, without a doubt, one of the best I've seen lately.An true eye opener.9 out of 10.",9,0,0,1 April 2001
Meet the Parents," Good
","For me that movie was some sort of repeat of «There's Something About Mary». If you liked that one, you'll probably like this one too. A lot of laughs and good acting by De Niro and Stiller. I'm not sure I would want to watch it a second time though. Maybe that's the difference between «Meet the Parents» and «There's Something About Mary».7 out of 10.",7,0,1,29 March 2001
12 Angry Men," What a great film this is
","Everybody should see this movie. I first saw it in my 12th grade law class (that was more than 10 years ago) and I just finished watch it again. Fantastic! I think it truly shows us what a great debate can do to the understanding of a case. It's justice at its best. We all have prejudices that we must try to put away when making a decision like these men have to make. Why not try to apply this decision making system in our daily life. Maybe then, we would live in a better world.You can feel the tension in that room. First of all, almost all of the action is in the jury room. It's also almost in real time, so you can follow exactly what happen in the hour and half that the men spend in that room. Another thing, it's the hottest day of the summer and the fan isn't working until almost at the end. I find also interesting that these men, at the end of the movie, know a lot about each other, but they don't even know each other's name. That's why jury #8 asks jury # 7 his name when exiting the court building at the end.Truly a classic to be watch by everybody.Out of 100, I gave it 89. (That's one of my 25 best movies ever seen)",10,0,1,14 April 2001
Billy Elliot," Loved it!
","This movie was very enjoyable to watch. It was moving, touching and funny. The acting was good and Jamie Bell (Billy) and Gary Lewis (his father) both gave top notch performances. It's good to see a movie like that once in a while.Out of 100, I gave it 86.",9,0,0,13 April 2001
Spice World," For the fans only
","You must be a fan of the Spice Girls to enjoy that one. There's actually no real story and without the music, there would be nothing. I would agree with some that there should be more songs in the movie. This movie will grow old pretty face. In 10 years when the Girls will probably be long gone from the music scene, there will small or no interest at all in watching this one.6 out of 10.",6,1,3,2 April 2001
Chicken Run," Excellent!
","This animated movie was funny, intelligent and beautifully done. I was just enchanted by the story and by the way it was tell. I was also quite fascinated by the influence the movie had on some kids. Some of them literally stop eating chicken after viewing this movie. The animal rights activists must be cheering for this movie!8 out of 10.",8,0,0,10 April 2001
Children of Heaven," Another great film from Iran
","This is just one of the many excellent movies that came out of Iran in recent years. Again the story is simple but poignant. Again the amateur actors do a wonderful job in their role. This is truly a movie that's enjoyable from beginning to end.Out of 100, I gave it 89.",9,9,11,16 April 2001
The Terminator," Kind of dated today, but still entertaining
","It's easy to figure that T1 wasn't make with the same kind of budget than T2. The futuristic scenes at the beginning looks pretty cheesy! There's some scenes that makes you say: oh! come on! Like when Sarah is running faster than a truck. Or the little love affair that grows bigger even though there's a killing machine going after them. And of course the police sirens when everything's finish. In how many movies have we seen that.But still, The Terminator is a good movie. Arnold is very good, even though I can't say the same for Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. The Terminator is not a classic, but it's entertaining nevertheless. Even though I preferred T2, T1 is deeper (even with all the flaws that the movie contains).Seen at home, in Toronto, on January 28th, 2005.78/100 (**½)",7,0,1,29 January 2005
Hotel Rwanda," An important movie
","Everybody should see this movie and even more our leaders. And they should feel ashame that they didn't act when the genocide was going on in 1994. And 10 years later, it's sad to say that lessons haven't been learned, even if a lot of good words have been said. Just look at what's going on in Darfur.Contrary to most people, I don't think Don Cheadle gave an Oscar winning performance. It's sometimes uneven. But Sophie Okonedo was just great. As for Nick Nolte, it was hard for me to really like him, because I was just thinking of General Roméo Dallaire, the true hero who was leading the incapacitated U.N. team. But forget about the acting, the story is too important to pay too much attention to performances. It's a heart wrenching film, with some rays of hope. There's some very moving scenes like the one where all the foreigners are leaving the hotel by bus.SEE IT! What more can I say?

Snatch," Home run for Guy Ritchie
",This is a very good movie by Guy Ritchie. The actors gave a stellar performance. The movie reminded me a little of «L.A. Confidential» for the camera movement techniques and the fast pace of the action. I would see it again. 8/10.,8,0,1,28 March 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," You can't fight here, this is a war room!
","Truly a great classic. But I find that the comedy, even though it is subtile a lot of the time, is not as great as the thriller. This is an excellent suspense movie. And it must have been quite something to see this film back in 1964, at the peak of the Cold War. The black and white also adds to the thrill.A lot of irony in this one. Examples: «You can't fight here, this is a war room», «Peace is our profession», etc.I was truly surprised after viewing Dr. Strangelove to learn in this database that Peter Sellers was playing three roles in this one: Group Capt. Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove himself. Excellent performance by Sellers but also by George C. Scott and the rest of the cast.Some may say that the movie is «passé» but I still find it pretty actual. Even though the Cold War ended more than a decade ago, nuclear power still exist and a lot of country now have the possibility to play with the lives of everybody around the world. Scary, isn't?Out of 100, I gave it a 90. This is good for a perfect 10 in the IMDB voting section.",10,1,2,23 April 2001
Pan's Labyrinth," Engrossing movie
","I waited and waited to see this movie, not expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised. It's a cinematic feast for the eyes. The camera movements, the picturesque setting, the dark underworld... Guillermo del Toro goes from reality to fantasy. When we are in one world, we can't wait to go back into the other to see what's going to happen next. The acting is superb. Especially from young Ivana Baquero, as Ofelia, and from Sergi Lopez, as Captain Vidal. The story is engaging, rich and imaginative. Fantastic it may be, but it's definitely not a movie to be seen by young children. Seen in Toronto, at the Market Square Cinemas, on February 11th, 2007.87/100 (***½)",9,2,5,15 February 2007
Rocky II," Good sequel to a very good movie
","The first Rocky was great. But you've got to give credit to Sylvester Stallone, the sequel, while not as good, is still pretty entertaining. This one picks up where the first one left us. With a little help from his lady, he's not out of the ring for long. And soon enough, he's taking on the champion. Rocky is some kind of a dim-wit with a big heart. You gotta love him. There is some strange scenes, like the one where hundreds of kids are surrounding our hero while he's having his morning jog. But for the most part, a very entertaining sequel. Can't wait to see Rocky III again.Seen at home, in Toronto, on September 5th, 2005.78/100 (**Â½)",7,1,2,4 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Maybe not the best ever... but still very good
","I'm not sure this movie would appear in the list of my 50 best films, but it's still a very good piece of entertainment.Call me an illiterate, but I have to confess that I haven't read Tolkien's work. But I was still able to enjoy the movie. And to enjoy I did! It's a magnificent epic adventure in a world with strange inhabitants. The acting is very good, Elijah Wood is radiant as Froddo, Ian McKellen excels in his role. I found Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett to be very good too.The cinematography is superb. You feel that you're there. You feel that you're the one being pursue by the darklord with the terrible black horse. Amazing what technology can do for the image. But amazing to see that a lot of the film was actually shot in New Zealand and Australia. Just fabulous scenary.I'm waiting for the Two Towers!Out of 100, I gave it 85.

Cast Away," Tom Hanks is one of the best

North by Northwest," Great Hitchcock classic
","What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said: JUST SEE IT! It's another Hitchcock classic. At 136 minutes, it could have drag on sometimes. But no, every minute of it is great. There's no dull moment. The music is great, so is the acting. Cary Grant delivers great lines: 'I don't intend to disappoint any of them by getting myself SLIGHTLY killed'. Ha ha ha! Grant would have made a great James Bond was I thinking while watching some scenes. And some scenes are memorable: the crop dusting plane scene is just one example. Hitchcock is like a great architect. Every scenes, every dialogue is well thought and well studied before making the final cut.Out of 100, I gave it 88.

The Patriot," Could've been so much better
","There's only two reasons why this movie is worth seeing: the cinematography is great and Tom Wilkinson is excellent as General Cornwallis.The rest is crap. This is no historical drama folks! Patriotism at its best. Not surprising that voters from the U.S. gave this one more that voters from elsewhere. The movie lacks accuracy, so much of it! And I hate those movies (just like Commando, remember that one!) when the two protagonists are fighting endlessly. In this case, it's Gibson against Jason Isaacs. The battle is raging around them, everybody's falling dead, but not them, Oh no!, nothing could disturb their little fight. Aaarrgghh!!! Why do directors take us for fools!Out of 100, I was way too generous and gave this one 71. That's ** on a **** stars rating system.",6,1,3,22 March 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Entertaining, but...
","Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. The actors are just great, specially Brad Pitt and Andy Garcia. OK, it's not the first movie a its genre. A great heist, this time three casinos. But there's little twists, here and there, that make the movie original and funny. But... why stick with the same old love-revenge story. Why do we need Julia Roberts character, I mean I surely don't mind her presence, but it's not relevant to the movie.
Still a good movie, an entertaining one.Out of 100, I gave it 81. That's good for *** stars on a **** stars rating system.Seen at the Famous Players Uptown Cinema, in Toronto, on January 8th, 2001.",8,0,0,8 January 2002
The Chorus," Old ingredients, winning formula
","Conventional, but still a very good movie. Not an original story, but well played. The music is sublime. Jean-Baptiste Maunier has a formidable voice. The acting is also great, from the lead actor (Jugnot) to the kids (Morhange, Corbin, Pépinot and others). It helps that the characters are likable. The movie is charming and touching, without being a bad sentimental tear-jerker. There's some funny moments and the film also acts as a social commentary.And the movie does a good job of transporting us to our own childhood. Ah! the time when we dreamt of conquering the world! «Bonheurs enfantins, trop vite oubliés, égarés» indeed.Seen at the Odeon Varsity Cinemas, in Toronto, on January 27th, 2005.87/100 (***½)",9,2,3,29 January 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A true masterpiece!
","One of my 10 best, so far. This is simply an excellent movie. The story is tinted with fantasy, magic and philosophy. The acting is fabulous and the cinematography is marvelous. A sure winner.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," My favorite of the trilogy!
","The epic saga of Middle Earth continues in this very good sequel to Fellowship. In fact, I think it's the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed it even more because I knew a bit more about the characters and the story. I must admit that I haven't read the books. The special effects are once again great and the battle scenes are spectacular. I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.Out of 100, I gave it 88.

Moulin Rouge!," «Truth, beauty, freedom, but above all, love»!
","Refreshing. Funny. «The show must go on». «It's raining outside, come inside, it's entertaining». That's true! This is very entertaining movie.Nicole Kidman is superb as Satine. She's surrounded by good actors and funny characters. What about Ziddler, and Toulouse-Lautrec!!! The sets are enchanting. It's like a big fairy tale. Funny the gun that klinks on the Eiffel tower! Of course, there's a lot of clichés («I'm dying Christian») but who cares, it's made up to be that way. Parody of musicals but also of classic litterature. Funny to use songs like Madonna's «Like a Virgin» in a movie about a nightclub in 1899 in Paris, France! Great songs, well chosen. I enjoy myself very much at this movie. I like the way the movie begin and finish with the curtain and the orchestra conductor. The entire generic is nice too.Out of 100, I gave it 83. That's *** on a **** stars rating system.

2001: A Space Odyssey," Grandiose
","2001 is visually stunning. Dazzling. Most of the film is candy for the eye. And an other sense is well treated: hearing. The music is superb. Great choice of classical music. I must admit that it was the first time I saw 2001. And I didn't really know what to expect. I was taken aback right at the beginning with the apes running the show for close to 20 minutes. Of course, like others, I find the end to be very hard to decipher. But it didn't ruin the rest of the movie. Truly a great film to watch and enjoy. I'd love to see it on the big screen.Seen at home, in Toronto, on January 8th, 2005.90/100 (****)",10,1,4,8 January 2005
There's Something About Mary," Good comedy
","I will admit with some other reviewers that this movie was a bit overrated. But it's still a fairly good comedy. There's a lot of good laughs and the acting is actually not bad. In the same genre and again with Ben Stiller, I would suggest Meet the Parents. In this one, replace Cameron Diaz by Robert DeNiro and there you have it, the same sort of jokes and gags.Out of 100, I gave it 79.",7,0,1,18 April 2001
Rocky," Never seen it? What are you waiting for!
","Americans like to believe that they live in the ultimate land of opportunity. And this film beautifully serves that purpose. Rocky is a nobody that soon finds himself at the top. Everything's possible for the little guy with courage. You might actually draw a parallel with Sylvester Stallone's own life. Before Rocky, he was almost unknown. He wrote the script for Rocky. It took him years of work but it paid off real big.The storyline is simple but efficient. No fluff. From the opening scene, the viewer's attention doesn't fade. Stallone is great and he's supported by a good cast. The cinematography is also good. And the music! Great soundtrack!

Titanic," A little bit too much fuss...
","This is a good movie but let's not consider it a masterpiece like some have do. I still don't understand why it won 11 oscars. You know the story, that incredible ship, the Titanic, who sunk on his first trip in 1912. It's the whole love story between Leonardo and Kate that's not very interesting. For me, the best part of the film, I must admit, it's when the ship go down under! Bernard Hill was excellent as the captain of the Titanic.In conclusion, Titanic is a bit too long but still a good movie. But let's not consider a classic too soon. 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,31 March 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Excellent!
","A Beautiful Mind is one of those movie that you can't stop thinking about it when you leave the theater. Now, I must admit that I knew nothing about the movie before entering the cinema. The only thing I knew was that it was about a mathematician. Nothing else! And boy, was I happy not to know more!This is a movie in two parts. In the first half, I was saying to myself: what is this, this movie is overrated, it's not that good, and so, and so. But then, everything comes to place (remember, I knew nothing about the film). And the second half more than compensate for the first. Put the two together, and you've got an excellent film.Russel Crowe is just superb as John Nash. And what about Jennifer Connelly. She delivers an excellent performance. And she's one of the prettiest actress around. I find her acting to be very intense, just like in Requiem for a Dream (another great movie).Of course, the movie doesn't tell all the story about John Nash. Doing a little be of research on the Net after, made me realized that some aspect of his life were omitted and other a little bit changed. But it's a movie, what can you do! Out of 100, I gave it 88.

The Last King of Scotland," Whitaker makes the movie
","May contain spoilers.I'm going to side with the Academy on this one: Forest Whitaker is brilliant as Idi Amin. In fact, this movie works because of Forest Whitaker. Without him, it would probably be just an average film. It's the story of a young doctor from Scotland who ends up in Uganda just when Amin is conducting his coup. Soon enough, Dr Garrigan is working for the dictator, as his personal doctor and then closest adviser. The young guy is blind-sided by power. At a certain point, you ask yourself who's more crazy: the doctor or the dictator? While Whitaker is great, McAvoy offers an average, sometimes weak, performance. The movie is a must just because it shows what kind of a man was Amin and how he made his people suffer. On the downside, the film stays on the surface and offers us no real explanation on how Amin got to lead his country. This fact is not saved by a few footnotes at the end of the movie. Finally, one could say the movie is more about Dr Garrigan's life than Idi Amin's one and the tragedy of the Ugandan people.Seen in Toronto, at the Fox, on March 3rd, 2007.81/100 (***)",8,2,7,4 March 2007
Jaws," Summer classic
","It's that time again where everybody's heading for the beach. Well, maybe I won't be doing some swimming in the ocean this year! Seeing this movie just convinced me to take my holidays in the mountains!Seriously, this is truly an exciting movie. The thrill is on from start to finish. The acting is good, especially Robert Shaw's character, Quint. The music is memorable as everybody know. Of course, we all know that the facts are not always true about the sharks, but still, it's a gem of a thriller.I saw it back in 1980 or so when I was 7 or 8 years old.

The Queen," Triumph
","Excellent movie by director Stephen Frears. He adroitly captures the mood of a nation, of most of the world in fact, that first week of September, almost ten years ago. The part that is fiction though shows the way the Royal family reacted to Lady Di's death. Who knows for sure how they reacted? But that's what also interesting about this film. It puts a human face on a personage known only in public. That was easy with Diana, it's more challenging to do for Elizabeth. Have you ever tried to imagine what the Queen does when she's relaxing in her private apartments? The movie reminds us that she's not only an old woman waving while sporting colorful hats. That brings me to the way Frears depicts the Royals. The Queen is of course rigid. But one can sense some sensibility some times, quickly put away by the more present sense of duty. Funny to think that the two Royals that are shown as the most insensitive are the ones that are usually considered more accessible: Prince Philip and the Queen mother (now dead, of course). All the Royals and their staff, but also Tony Blair and his entourage are brilliantly played by an excellent cast. At the top: Helen Mirren. She's just great. A word on the use of footages from the archives. I think the director did an excellent job of mixing those with the fictionalized parts.A question remains though: has the Queen seen the movie? If so, could she please let us know what she thought of it by posting a comment on IMDb? This would truly show the world that she's able to modernize her institution!Seen in Toronto, at the Beach Cinemas, on October 28th, 2006. 88/100 (***½)",10,1,2,28 October 2006
Casino Royale," You want action, you got it!
","As soon as the nicely done opening credits are over with, the action starts. And what a great action sequence! My favorites scenes: the airport one and the poisoning sequence at the Casino. From one end of the world to the other, James Bond is back and he's showing no pity for the enemy. Daniel Craig does an excellent James Bond. He's got the charm, the look, the wit and the athletic 'prouesse' that goes with the character. I like the fact that he shows a bit more vulnerability than in other Bond movies. And I really liked the 'Le Chiffre' character as the villain. I must confess that the last Bond movie I saw before this one was 'Octopussy'. But 'Casino Royale' makes me want to see the ones I missed. Seen in Toronto, at the Fox Cinema, on January 26th, 2007.83/100 (***)",8,1,4,27 January 2007

The movie is funny, intelligent and dramatic. I also liked the film on an ethical point of view.Hitchcock hits gold with the camera movement. You really feel that you see the neighborhood through the eyes of James Stewart's character. Hitchcock hits gold again with the choice of the actors. Stewart and Kelly are both electrifying.

It's nice to see how the movie ends. Hitchcock, in some way, is letting you believe that something like this could happen to you on your next trip to the cottage. Without giving any explanations for the birds actions, Hitchcock changes the way we're going to be looking at a flock of seagulls. What if???Out of 100, I gave it 84.",8,1,1,12 April 2001
