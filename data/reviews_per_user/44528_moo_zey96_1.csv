Deja Vu," great action scenes, but not very plausible.
","Spoiler alerti have to admit, with the stellar cast of Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer,Adam Goldberg, Bruce Greenwood this movie was kind of a let down. Even Tony Scott couldn't save the seemingly week storyline.Good actions? Yes. Good acting? Perhaps, Denzel with his usual flair.But if anything,what this movie actually does is to bring forth an explanation about time space... and actually telling the audience this is what we think about time space...the theory of time space is tediously complex,near if not absolutely random, and perhaps may never be proved by science.The movie claims that only did we discovered the definitive theory of time space, but that humans can actually exploit it.This group of law enforcers had in fact meddled with the fabric of existence itself, messing with reality as we know it..earth,the sun, birds,flowers,matter,antimatter,heaven,hell etc.Don't get me wrong.The characters were decently written, and the movie tries to paint the scenario of would man do if he had stumbled upon a larger than life scientific discovery .One tries to play God( note the disaster when we discovered the atomic source of energy)Not his fault though, they've played God from the moment they developed the time travel technology. good actions scenes though. just don't expect it to make sense.",Null,2,4,9 December 2006
