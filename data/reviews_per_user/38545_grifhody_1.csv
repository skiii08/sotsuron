Casablanca," Still one of the best
","This movie remains simply as one of the best of all time. 
The characters, the lines, and the story -- and I STILL cry when the Marsailleaise is being played.Bogart's face when he first sees Ilsa, the expressions of terror on Peter Lorre's face, even Sam's concern for Rick....What a classic!",10,0,1,9 January 2004
