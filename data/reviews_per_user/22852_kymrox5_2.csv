It," Disturbing characterizations
","The film is great & could have been fantastic. My only complaint, why is it necessary to have such foul language in films nowadays. Especially this film where the kids utter 4 letter words non-stop throughout. This junk was NOT in the original story & was totally unnecessary in my opinion. IIC.",Null,1,1,28 October 2018
Annihilation," Ridiculous and boring
","What can I add that hasn't been said already? A definite waste of time. The dialogue, storyline & monsters are all laughable. I can't believe they actually published a book first. I can't imagine who'd even sit down to read it. How do they continually find financing for this crap?? Two-time Oscar winner Portman must be hard up for work or dating someone involved with this garbage.",Null,3,8,5 January 2019
