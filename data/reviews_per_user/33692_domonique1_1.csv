National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Good Sequel?
","Yes, it has actually facts. Yes it's a children's movie. Yes it's a sequel. And yes, it's amazing. National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets may be the first ever sequel that could do well on it's own. Although the movie isn't as jokey and funny as it's predecessor, it still is worthy of a 'two thumbs up' by those two men we all love. Abigal is seeing other men so we also have relationship problems too. So much for a Disney movie, and with a heroic ending everything is just awesome. We even have the guns out again, although there is about a twenty min. car chase that could have been minimized down to about five. Riley finally meets his special someone too. At first we think it'll be a little different because Riley is constantly being overshadowed by Ben, and the Ferrari gets taken away. The perfect day.",9,1,3,7 January 2008
