Requiem for a Dream," It will open your eyes to your addiction whichever it is
","It's one of the movies that shows you how disgusting life is. And where so many movies try to show addiction for drugs as the only kind of addiction that should be feared, this movie exhibits other kinds of addictions that can be as dangerous as drugs i.e. TV, sex and show-off.It is true that the movie focuses on probably four or five types of addictions but it rings a bell and makes you think that surely each one of us has his/her own addiction and if it was not controlled wisely, it will lead to undesirable consequences.Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and specifically Marlon Wayans are extremely geniuses in their roles with once-in-a-lifetime performance from Ellen Burstyn. I find it so strange that those who didn't love the movie, at least admit the fine acting of the main roles! Darren Aronofsky is a director that deserves a careful study of his masterwork... this director, if you have seen so many movies, you will notice that he has come with something new of his own and he is worth of same credits given to directors like Tarantino, Spielberg, and my favorite De Palma.Music is so beautiful which also gives a star to Clint Mansell.This movie as you can evidently see has so many strong elements and therefore is a must-watch movie.",9,0,0,30 March 2009
Catch Me If You Can," fairly entertaining
","It's definitely an entertaining movie with all the decent elements that a good movie should have. Spielberg is there, Hanks, DiCaprio, and Walken acting, and a funny true story.The movie is evil in one way that makes you attracted to the smartness in tricking people. I've always enjoyed watching this 'crooky' kind of intelligence and you cannot but notice that even Hanks admired the character of Abignale Jr.The only flaw in the movie, however, is that though a problem existed in the relationship of the parents, the leading character played by DiCaprio had no other dimensions. I think probably there should have been more work on how the character developed to become that smart, tricky and lovable. Still, DiCaprio is a brilliant actor and hasn't been fairly treated in Hollywood yet.",6,0,3,2 November 2009
The Ring," If you are a fan of horror movies, this is a new thing.
","I love horror movies and I find it strange that there are people who tend to think of horror movies as not-realistic!!! There is no such thing as not realistic. Once a mind can imagine something, that something has officially become reality. It has logically shifted from something that didn't exist to something that exists.Horror movies have something pleasurable about them even if the same idea of people getting killed every time is being repeated. There is always the new way used for eliminating the victim and the factor which is causing the horror. This is the case with the ring, the source of horror this time is a regular video tape and here lies the originality of the idea.I am fanatic when it comes to horror movies. I love to watch them at late night with the light off and nobody is around to feel the tensity of the movie and to enjoy it more. Then, I tend to watch it again with my friends with the same environment but after I judge that it's a worth sharing movie. The second time I watched it with my friends, one of them actually asked us at the end what if we all die now that we have seen the tape. He was joking of course and we all laughed but obviously the idea got to his head and made him think of the possibility.It's a good movie only if you like horror movies.",8,1,1,30 March 2009
Se7en," You will commit the 8th sin if you don't watch 7
","David Fincher of Se7en, The Game, Fight Club and recently the Curious Case of BB! What could you need more to get you into watching Seven if you haven't yet?! Ah, let me guess, probably you'd need Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. What else, let me see, hmmm what about the great Kevin Spacey (come on Spacey of Americna Beauty, L.A. Confidential, Usual Suspect, 21 and his first and best Seven). Now, add to all that 7 sins which means 7 murders and not only that you need to guess what are the 7 sins because many people have watched it, loved it, praised it but when I asked them who was the 7th victim, they simply didn't know the answer. Count the people murdered in the movie once more and you will know what I am talking about. This movie is, simply and in one word, just amazing.",9,1,1,16 October 2009
Fight Club," Very sharp and edgy in its sarcasm
","It's an original movie that attacks today's consumerism and deals with the environment of failure that we have locked ourselves in for the sake of being successful as the society labels it. It shows the frustration that has invaded our minds and souls and how this frustration is translated into many different mental disfunctionings that eventually change the end results of everything that matters in our lives. Such a brilliant brilliant plot and a so out of the box idea that the movie industry hadn't been clever before to make use of it and I don't think there will be a future plan of the like to outsmart this one.If you don't watch it, you will be committing a crime that yourself doesn't deserve it and specially if you are into movies. This is a classic that should find its way into your library.",9,1,3,16 October 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Such a startling horror... it will eat you alive!
","I enjoyed this horror immensely but the ending of this movie is just like almost all other horror movies, I hate to ruin it for you but no body makes it!I hate it when people say Hollywood ending i.e. when the central characters make it at the end! As if this counts! Don't you people watch horror movies?!!!! I have watched hundreds of them and rarely do protagonists make it at the end! It's always the villain and when they do, remember the villains keep coming back! As much as I've seen movies where heroes die at the end, I started to feel like 'hollywood endings' don't exist anymore, that's if they ever did! It truly repulses and wards me off when people say I didn't like this movie because the hero won!!!! or when they don't understand a movie which might be because the movie is rubbish, they just think it should be clever because they were stupid enough to not to understand it like the majority did with 'Eden Log' !!!! So, back to this piece of art. It's beautiful and full of details that will make you enjoy every single second of the movie. It's so rare that movies are eye-catching in every single detail.To wrap it up, this movie has it all. It has all the elements that make a movie decent and specifically a horror movie so great as this one.",9,0,0,15 October 2009
The Others," Well-brought-up movie by all means
","This is a movie that you can comfortably say is Good and don't have to recalculate the rating so many times comparing it with other movies to come up with your final judgment.The movie's best element is the casting. All the characters in this movie have done great from the gardener, his wife and daughter, to the kids and the husband who shows up in two scenes only. Nicole Kidman , there is nothing to say about her flawless performance in this one and I believe she already matured in her works starting Hours, playing virginia woolf and moulin rouge and others but she is really at her best in The Others.The movie has a very catching atmosphere and the house decoration is just brilliant. The movie tells you in many scenes that you are watching the work of a good director.",7,0,2,15 October 2009
L.A. Confidential," It's a movie that offers you a new story, witty plot, great actors, and brilliant characters
","I always had something extra for movies that offer you many characters equally interesting and you have to choose one as the best. In L.A. Confidential, you have the brilliant character of Spacey my favorite in this movie, who goes with the flow and plays it brilliantly but he is honest from the inside and without his brilliance the case wouldn't have been solved. Then, you have the character of Russle Crowe, the emotional who has no control over his feelings and his physical strength helps as well in solving the pieces of the puzzle, and finally the character of Guy Pearce who is smart, overly ambitious, and his jealousy which comes from his insecurity makes him act irrationally in a way different than that of Crowe. You have these three ingredients, add to them Devito and Basinger and you will have a delicious movie cocktail.I don't know if anyone remembers the scene of the atheist, in 'Five Card Stud' with Dean Martin, who before he dies he puts his hands in a way as if he was praying though he is atheist from which Martin was able to know that the criminal is the priest (Robert Mitchum). Spacey does something of the like in the movie. I love these brilliant spices which makes the plot smarter and more entertaining.",8,0,1,30 March 2009
Final Destination 2," As I said before I like all 4 FDs but this is my best!
","This part is full of creative deaths and though was like all the rest using the same plot as the first and building on it, didn't make it the least boring for me. I loved it and I found out that I never got turned off by this detail that the whole story is repeating itself in all 4s.There is something about the idea of this movie that makes it watchable even if it reached the 100th provided that the deaths scenes get more challenging. The characters in this movie also were no less convincing than the characters of the first.My best death scene in this part is the elevator death. Pretty amazing!",7,2,2,13 October 2009
The Devil Wears Prada," It is a movie that you can understand only while growing up!
","I don't expect from a teenager to understand such a movie or in fact anyone who has low ambitions in life. This movie is meant for people who have great ambitions and the more they grow in age the more they will appreciate this movie.It's a great movie in a very new context with the Goddess of acting Meryl Streep. It's a movie about choices in life when it comes to career and climbing up the ladder. Too bad that people who don't understand this kind of movies comment with confidence that it is not a very good movie? Well anyone who concluded that this movie is not good enough either was sleeping during the movie or analytical skills are really below the average level. I am sorry but this movie is just great. It made me tear at the end. Yes I teared. Some people they cry for things that are sad but this movie just hits on the strings of heart. It's not a sad story... It's a real life story! If you are still on the first step of the ladder waiting to climb higher, you'd better watch this movie till the end and rethink everything that you expect awaiting you.Last two scenes when Anne Hathaway leaves the car and throws her mobile is very expressive of the feel of freedom that today's career people have lost and I am one of them. The last scene is just wonderful when Merly streep admires Hathaway's decision but she chooses to continue with her style of living which made her lose two husbands and lead a miserable personal life for the sake of feeling the power she got herself used to.There you go, this movie tells you which path you would love to find yourself in; is it power vs. sad personal life or freedom vs. career with no power but talks to your passion.Great movie indeed ... not anyone can understand and enjoy.",10,1,2,30 March 2009
Notting Hill," Another stupid movie
","I couldn't watch the whole movie as I remember missing some scenes and when this happens with me, it means only one thing that the movie is soooooooo bad. Being not able to watch it all, I can't really understand those who would be able to watch it twice! Do such people truly exist! I mean believing that Marsians exist is easier.Julia Roberts is gorgeous this true and Hugh Grant is handsome this is too factual but this doesn't give the movie makers the right to gather them in such a silly movie while relying on their charm as if that alone would do! And the scene where his disgusting roommate comes out naked! Wow gross and so sickening! Was that supposed to make me laugh! No seriously, was it?!",2,2,11,18 November 2009
The Thing," Dear Horror addicts, you shouldn't miss this one!
","I don't know if it's too bad or too good that not so many people love horror movies but I find it strange every time somebody is surprised that I am a horror genre fan! Horror movies talk to our most basic instinct which is fear and stimulate our numerous fears in different ways. And the good thing too is that whenever your fear is quivered, your intellect moves up in a very profound way using all the possible weapons that one could think of just for the sake of your own survival. There you go, adrenaline of heart and mind both revived each time you watch a horror movie and specially a decent one like 'The Thing'.Nothing more really can be said to add to what all the other reviewers said about the movie director, the original short story, and the acting. Excellent movie and you deserve to treat your heart and mind with it.",8,3,5,16 September 2009
The Hills Have Eyes," So much similar to Wrong Turn
","Both Wrong Turn (2003) and The Hills Have Eyes (2006) are similar so much even in small details like both people take directions of the wrong road from the gas station and oddly enough both old men look the same. Anyhow, I liked wrong turn more. The director Alexandre Aja seems to be a promising horror movies director though I didn't like mirrors but I liked this one and the Haute Tension.There were artistic horror scenes in this one and some might go liking this one more than Wrong Turn but the overall atmosphere of the latter makes it way much better than the prior.Again, I liked both but my voice goes for Wrong Turn.",7,0,1,16 September 2009
Doctor Zhivago," Simply not worth of its good credits!
","It is not a movie that I was capable of watching more than once. I watched it twice in fact just to see why it had taken all the credits and I couldn't like it. I even tried to force myself see if there were elements I neglected but no.The only thing worth the time in this whole work is the character of Lara and for this I prefer to read the novel. Lara's character is one that confuses you. Was she a sexual character or a romantic one? I will not go more detailful about this part for it's not the literature work we are discussing, it is the movie as a whole.I never liked the acting of Omar Al Sharif but he wasn't bad in this one, however, this doesn't make the movie any better.",2,9,19,30 March 2009
The Shining," Original and will stay so...
","It's the most difficult to write a review on the classics. It's always easier to write on movies that have very few reviews and nothing much been said. So when I came to write on The Shining, I found 1008 reviews. Wow! I mean what more could be said! You are scared that whatever you are gonna say has been definitely said and you don't have time to read all those reviews to make sure you are writing something brand new.To cut the story short and to make it easy for those who have not watched it yet, one thousand something review is definitely definitely a very clear sign that the movie is a must see. You don't want to let a movie that has been seen by everybody else, do you? You love the idea of ghosts? does the idea of a vacant hotel which has rooms where a murder was committed attract you? Come on, it's a hunted hotel in a very cold place and nothing surrounds it but trees covered with stories of snow and a small family of parents and their little kid have to live in this hotel for months alone, and you don't feel the least tempted to watch?!One more final thing, the father is Jack Nicholson and the director is Kubrick!",8,0,0,10 November 2009
American Beauty," Simple yet so complicated
","Alright, it is one of those movies that you don't really understand well because it is one of those that leaves you with an open ending and at your own to conclude the reflections of your inside more than anything else. One thing I can guarantee you is that you won't get bored. The story is entertaining with all the elements necessary; great actors Spacey and Benning, beautiful girls, and a story that is pretty much yours or one of your neighbors/friends/acquaintances.So, the story you know quite well. The name of the lead character is Lester so you can guess the mood. He is leading the ordinary life of our everyday and this is why exactly the movie is so scary. The movie is trying to show us that though our life is simple and predictable because of the routine surrounding, it can lead us to many complications and ends in a very tragic way like Lester's. Look at your life, as boring as it is currently, can't you see that you can guess the rest of your days easily? Doesn't it scare you? That's why sometimes you need to add some dangerous elements to it like having feelings to your daughter's best friend, smoking drugs, or any other destructive activity. Living is truly an art or even a science that you need to learn to know how to live right.",7,0,0,20 November 2009
Judgment at Nuremberg," How criminalistic we humans can get to be!
","The movie actually is so rich with contents that tackle mainly the human nature and how we all tend to judge each others while we have crimes of our own that are no less inhumane than of those whom we are judging.I like most the scene when the lawyer (Maximilian Shell) says that Americans were not less brutal and merciless than the Nazi's when they bombed atomically Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the world war II in 1945. In the movie, there was a focus on the issue of applying such cruel measures against humanity under the excuse of 'it was our duty and we had no other choice'. This is exactly what Margaret Thatcher said in her book 'The Path to Power'. She said: 'We don't regret bombing Japan and if we go back again in time we would do the same thing all over again'. Just look at the wars of today, so many crimes in the name of duty are being committed but there is no judgment anymore! Anyway, another scene which I liked so much in the movie is when Maximillian Shell the lawyer is talking to the witness Judy Garland and he shouts to her face in a psychological way and forces her to crack down, cry and confess something which was not true! Psychologically speaking, this is very true and needs certain skills to be done.The movie is just amazing and there is no single second in the movie that gets you to be bored. It's long but too entertaining with so many great actors Tracy the judge, Lancaster the lead character among the Nazis being judged, Marline Dietrich, Richard Widmark, and Montgomery Clift.",8,2,2,20 November 2009
The Usual Suspects," You just have to see this movie
","One of the rarities , one of the classics, one of the most entertaining, and by far one of the most enjoyable experiences! It starts in the first scene with a sign for you if you are intelligent enough to know exactly what's happening in the movie later. But this really needs a very high level of intelligence and attention so if you don't get it, just enjoy the plot.There is this one single scene in the movie that really would make you laugh your eyes out between Chaz Palmentri and Kevin Spacy when the prior is bragging about how much smarter he is than Spacy. You just need to watch it to understand what I am talking about.Brilliant movie in so many ways and things; directing, acting, plot and again the performances were all superb!",9,0,0,6 January 2010
Independence Day," I watched it when I was 15 years old...
","That was something to a 15-year-old! I still remember that day vividly. My dad took me to the cinema to watch ID4 and that was like the happiest day of the year! I have to agree with the review that says ID4 must be seen on a very big screen and I don't think any screen would do better than the Cinema's. The effects are huge in that movie and to feel them right,the way they were originally tailored for you to feel, you need to see it in cinemas but since now it's not feasible to do so, you can still watch it and keep in mind this single info in order not to misjudge the movie.I remember the scene when the alien they found and grouped around to study awakened all of a sudden and hit the glass. At that moment, every one in the audience even those who were sitting in the balcony, reflexively moved back to their chairs as if the alien is coming towards them with that 'huh' sound which was heard from all at once. I am not exaggerating that really happened and we are not talking 3D here. That's how good Roland Emmerich! Another scene was that when the lady is driving the car with her son and dog so she manages to escape the fire in the tunnel going into some hole in the wall and then for few minutes she is trying to save her baby and we were all sitting nervous so when she finally does, we were all like 'thank God' and relieved but that wasn't all because the director made us is a few seconds care for saving the dog as well so back to nervousness until the dog was also saved. Those were moments in the movie that I still remember even after 14 years! I didn't watch ID4 again. It was that once but I still remember most of it.",8,1,3,20 November 2009
Gone with the Wind," An antique that lost its patina
","It's one of those movies that can shine only in its time. Back then, I would understand all the noise that this movie had made but nowadays, it needs a lot lot more than Clark Gable for the audience to give a dam..n! You definitely gotta see it for you cannot miss a classic specially if you consider yourself a know-it-all movie fan! However, I promise you it's not gonna be that much of a satisfying experience.The ending though is good considering that the movie was made in 1939. And the character of Scarlet O'Hara played by Vivien Leigh is an attractive character, very novelistic that one can study and enjoy analyzing the maturing process she goes through.",5,2,10,18 November 2009
The Mist," Stephen King's The Mist
","A movie is usually referred to by the Director's movie but this doesn't apply to Stephen King's works. When you watch an adaptation of Stephen King, you gotta give the credit to the right man.I agree with one of the viewers that 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the best of King's adaptation and 'The Green Mile' is definitely a good movie but we need to be fair about one thing. The Green Mile is so similar to a movie that was released in 1995 called 'Powder' while 'The Green Mile' was written in 1999. I enjoyed 'The Green Mile' but not as much as everybody else did because I had already watched 'Powder'.Anyhow, back to The Mist. I have to make it clear that the creatures in the movie were not really that scary but the idea of the world ending this way is possible and scary. Just the idea of being prisoned in one place and not knowing what the h'll is going on out side and even if you go out and see that there is no evidence of life anymore, is so damn scary. I loved the movie and enjoyed it a lot as it had so many strong elements. I usually enjoy the horror movies that group bunch of people who don't know each others in one place where they try with their different characters to save their lives. I also like it how people split into believing what's going on and others being just skeptical about the whole idea.The character of the religious lady is just so smart and the ending of the movie though shocking and disturbing but beautiful and you wouldn't have liked it to be different even though.",7,1,3,10 November 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Here Here Clint Eastwood
","It just doesn't seem possible that Clint Eastwood of Sergio Leon who acted in Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly can direct such a different kind of movies which I like as well such as Bridges of Madison County, Mystic River, Changeling and Millioin Dollar Baby.The movie is just awesome! A good story with a wonderful actor Hillary Swank. She is playing a challenging role because such roles are usually prepared for men but Hillary is so good that even men admired her in this role. What can you say more when you have an amazing presence of two great actors like Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman.It's a movie that you definitely need to watch and believe me you don't want to miss such a work.",8,3,4,15 October 2009
Casualties of War," Ladies & Gents, It's THE Brian De Palma!
","I've said it before and I will keep sayin' it. Brian De Palma is my favorite director, with all do respect to Trantino and Kubrick, I like the latter two guys but De Palma is by far the Master. Have you seen Scarface, Untouchables, The Black Dhalia, Dressed to kill, Carrie, and Sisters? Of course you did! De Palma is the director of variety. De Palma directed movies like untouchables and scarface but also romance and horror, and Nam movies like Casualties of war. Tarantino and Kubrick had a certain line they walked through but didn't diversify! N e how, Casualties of war is a Nam movie that storms your thoughts and stirs your fears of how cruel, unethical, and chaotic wars can get to be. The casualties of the war were many in the movie hence the (/s). The girl who was beastly raped was not the only casualty in the movie. Humanity is the first casualty and then comes the people in war who disagree of what's going on but can't really take a real stand. If you think about it, I am sure that in Iraq today the same scene is taking place and almost anywhere there is war! It scares me a lot the idea that many people are defendless, helpless and become victims for no viable reason in wars! I just want to take all my hats off to De Palma and being a girl it felt like my nails pinched holes in my palms because I was so aggravated by the rape scenes. Sean Penn, you can tell, is a very good actor from this movie and too bad it took him long to climb up until recently he reached.Michael J. Fox, I loved him ever since he played Alex P. Keaton in Family Ties and he is just so good! If you are a nam movies fan, Brian De Palma fan, and good movies fan, then this one is definitely for YOU.",8,0,1,2 November 2009
Singin' in the Rain," there is something about the way Kelly danced under the rain...
","Sometimes I am too happy while walking on the streets and it feels just like dancing that dance without the umbrella of course! The movie is a classic and it's one of my three favorite musicals: Singing in the rain, West Side Story, and Sound of Music.There are some funny scenes that are so pure with no complications and can make you laugh long like for instance the one when Kelly and O'Connor make fun of the phonetics instructor and the scene when O'Connor sings make'm laugh. And of course, at the end when Lina Lamont is singing and doing that silly move with her hands. The movie is just one of the unforgettable classics.",8,0,1,20 November 2009
Taken," Liam Neeson is the One Star of this Movie and thanks to his dazzling performance, this movie is now on my list of Great movies!
","My list of great movies usually doesn't include action movies but more of the movies with depth and tactical plots and the likes, however, Taken is by far one of the very smart movies if one looks closely to details. Like for instance, I haven't seen any of Peter Morrel's before but there are details in the directing that shows brilliance like when Neeson is trying to barge in the apartment from which his daughter got kidnapped and while he is crossing from one window to another holding the upper edge of the out-wall, you can see clearly that the director focused on his eye wrinkles to show the effort of trying to impossibly hold on to his fingertips not to fall. Such details , only people who pay attention to the director's effort can notice them. Not to mention the shooting of some scenes were so masterfully taken like when Neeson is having the last fight with the man on the yacht and when he takes the drugged girl from the Albanians. Additionally, there is the tracing process that he does and there were details which my friends didn't notice like when he gives the paper with the phrase Good Luck but in Albanian and pretends to want to know the translation. He listens carefully to the voices of all the guys and then he picks the one he suspects he wished him good luck when kidnapped his daughter. Also, the way he notices the spotter on his daughter's mobile sim-card. And when he shoots his friend's wife in the hand ,,, all the cold blood Neeson kills with is so believable because it's his only daughter who we can see clearly from the beginning of the movie that she is his life so the story connects so well and makes all the action that I heard one of the commentators laughing at so believable and needs some kind of a certain intelligence to grasp the whole concept of the movie. And by the way, all spy movies are so stupid that they don't focus on the character of the spy and the skills he usually has as much as they focus on the stupid action like in John Woo's stupid action movies and James Bond. It's the first spy character that really can exhibit a set of skills that make you wish you were a spy. They way he reacts to how his daughter is being kidnapped while she is with him on the phone, the attention to details, the use of language, the mobile tracking while the french police tries to locate him, the driving of the car, the usage of syringe to help heal the drugged girl, torturing techniques, the negotiation with drug dealers. God I just loved this movie and I love Liam Neeson for he is really really and by far one of the greatest actors from Schindler's list to Ethan Frome (Stunning performance) to Suspect (with Cher) and many others. It really annoys me so much that some of the people dare to criticize his accent bluntly. Is this the kind of criticism where you insult the whole movie industry by ignoring the performance and shedding the light on the accent!!!!!! Such people usually don't really have any idea about movies, actors, directors, writers and they really don't understand anything but they are bitter enough to go waste their time eating popcorn and making fun of good movies to give their friends some good laughs. Thank God, they are usually few.",8,1,5,29 June 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Good movie though there were some silly scenes
","I thought the opening scene of the kid swallowed by the floor was very poor and ridiculous and the movie remained boring for me until the old lady comes to the bank. Starting from here, I guess the movie began attracting me. I liked the very idea of casting this old lady (she was a perfect cast for the role). The car scene between the old lady and the loan officer was also a classic and pretty much was the master scene of the whole movie. Then comes the scenes where she kills her cat (that was really funny) and the scene when she visits her boyfriend's parents at the table, that felt more of meet the parents than any horror movie.I easily guessed that the coin was mistaken for the button. Actually from the very beginning of the movie when she gives him the coin as a gift, I told myself that the coin will have a lot to do with the plot.Not a very good movie but a good and should see one as the movie comes with a new idea : an old lady cursing a loan-officer for taking her house away from her. The idea doesn't promise a lot of horror and I don't think of the movie as a horror movie but it has the minimum.",6,0,2,16 September 2009
Mission: Impossible," Such movies teach you the manner of watching movies
","First, I am a loyal fan of De Palma. OK the man basically did the Untouchables, Scarface, wise guys, Carlitos Way, Carrie, casualties of war!!! Many people judge a director by the work as a whole, not the history of his all works, diversification, and elements of one work. Well if you focus on these three elements, you will find from the movies I named above that De Palma has done it all! Let us see: Mission Impossible I was the best of all three and it was the only one directed by De Palma. The second was directed by John Woo and the third by J.J.Abrams. If you watch the second you will see a touch of face/off from Woo but nothing that teases your brain. If you watch the third, well nothing is good about it. However, the first one is a movie that almost everyone I know who watched it the first time wasn't capable of understanding the plot quite properly! It's one of the very few action movies that requires full attention and respect to the plot. We all know action movies' plots! So, anyone who didn't like this movie is simply one that didn't understand the plot with its minutest details that need a proper viewing. De Palam, hats off to you for you master any work you put your hands on.If you like brain teasers, if you appreciate great directors, if you enjoy plots that put your wit to test, then Mission Impossible I is the right movie for you.",8,4,5,30 March 2009
Rosemary's Baby," I heard so much about it until I finally saw it...
","Have you ever heard about a movie so much that sometimes even pretended to have watched it while you haven't yet because you made up your mind to but kept waiting for the right moment. The right moment came at last and I finally watched Rosemary's Baby which to my surprise was a delightful one.I don't consider it a horror specially that I am a huge horror fan but it is definitely a good movie that has to be seen. However, it should be seen way before you have seen The Omen, It's Alive, Grace, and all the movies that came within this same line. Trust me you will be bored if you have seen all these movies and then you do Rosemary's baby unless you paid attention to the smart details inside this movie. The casting of the old neighbors is just brilliant. For me, they're the best element in this movie. The first time Rosemary and her husband are invited to the old couple apartment for dinner, I wondered how would I have reacted if I were in there shoes trying to eat that disgusting food cooked by that old lady... it surely needed lots of guts.The movie is an enjoyable experience because it's original.",8,0,0,20 November 2009

","In my 'Powder' review I mentioned the similarities between this movie and Powder where the latter was even written years before this one was released. If you see both movies you will know what I am talking about. The most charming scenes in the Green Mile are taken from Powder. I am sure that all who watched both remembers quite well the scene where Powder makes the guy who hunts the deer feels the pain of the animal. Exactly same scene when Michael Duncan makes the guy who kills the mouse feel its pain. Another similar scene or idea is when Michael Duncan in the 'Green Mile' heals James Cromwel's ill wife which is taken from Powder who helps the Sheriff's wife to deal with her dying process.I am not saying that the 'Green Mile' is not a good movie. On the contrary, I enjoyed it a lot but Powder is a decent one and was made way before the Green Mile so it deserves to be praised being the original at least.",7,1,2,18 November 2009
Hitch," Better than the new romantic comedies
","It's a nice movie to watch more than one time to pass time and entertain yourself. All performances in this movie are good and Kevin James is really funny as Albert specially the scene in which he calls Alegra and he asks Hitch if he should tell her that he is not in! And then Hitch goes like: you called to tell her that you are not in!!! That scene is hilariously funny. I liked Kevin James in here more than Mall Cop. Mall Cop, unfortunately, is not a funny movie at all! Besides the funny scenes in Hitch, the movie also has some deep messages like the fact that people only superficially admire the beauty, social status, and never the real under-skin thing! We all keep talking about it and criticize it while in real we are all victims of it and most probably it is the same reason why the majority of us have lost the opportunity of being with someone nice and decent but not good-looking, rich, or well educated! We need more movies like Hitch, Shallow Hal, Truth about cats and dogs and the likes to really start creating the balance in our emotional lives not judging by appearances.",7,0,0,30 March 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Life has never been more beautiful!
","This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap, even when all your life has crumbled over your face, hope is still your last hope.One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped! What would you have done had you been in his shoes? keep on hoping? Well, Andy not only had hope, he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he weren't in this movie, the movie would have lacked something for sure.There are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.",10,2,3,30 March 2009
Platoon," Don't know what to say!
","It's movies like this that makes you come to write and delete and then rewrite and delete like thousand times because you fear to write something not equally as powerful as these movies deserve one to write for.Stone obviously has something about Vietnam that can be seen in most of his movies. I have seen almost all Nam movies (Born on the 4th of July 'Oliver Stone', The Deer Hunter 'Michael Cimino', Casualties of War 'Brian De Palma and Stone happened to be screenwriter', Apocalypse Now 'Francis Ford Coppola', etc..) and therefore, I can guilt-free-mindedly say that Platoon is by far the best of all. All the actors in the movie were excellent- Charlie Cheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger,Johnny Depp, John C. McGinley (scrub), Kevin Dillon and others can't remember now but all performed remarkably.Stone, though has a clear empathy for the soldiers of Nam, exhibits in a very provocative way the brutal acts of the soldiers to the locals. There is this one scene of the young Korean (or gook as the soldiers referred to them)with one leg and deformed eye who was hiding with his mom under the ground and Kevin Dillon humiliates him and kills him. This scene is a clear sign that Stone sympathized with the locals and despised such indecent actions. Another master scene in the movie is when Taylor (Charlie) is finally in the helicopter leaving the battle and looks from above to the hole which is filled with corpses of soldiers (very brilliant of Stone).Chapeau bas Stone!",10,1,3,9 November 2009
Bruce Almighty," I've never found Jim Carrey funny!
","I have never found Jim Carrey funny but still enjoyed the ideas of the movies he played. No seriously think about it, didn't you like the idea of this movie that God wanted to show a person how stressful is His godly job is! Amazing idea and I also liked the idea of 'Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind', 'The Trueman Show', and 'The Number 23'. Same goes for 'Liar Liar' , 'The Mask', and recently 'Yes Man'. If you think about it, the ideas are just beautiful! He is not funny (for me at least) but he is good and I like him but I never promise myself to laugh whenever I watch a movie of his. He is simply not funny! So, if I want to laugh, I just don't buy a Jim Carrey movie, but if I want to watch something new with a really new idea, then Jim Carrey's movies are the right choice.Steve Carrel didn't do the right thing by playing Evan the Almighty! That was kind of a stupid thing to do. Who would watch the whole thing again!",5,0,0,18 November 2009
Final Destination," I am a fan of all 4 FDs despite the bad reviews of the last two
","FD is the kind of movies that you dare call a decent one. It's the sole movie that dealt with death as a character of its own. It's the only movie that made me see death as a person who chases people in a smart tactical way and more importantly in a way that is set ahead that if you can escape it once, you will definitely fail the next time for Death has plan B for you! The idea was new, I know what you will say that death premonitions have already been used in Movies. That's true but not in the frame where death is pictured as a character of intelligence of its own. In the movie, you can't but sense the presence of death as a human being but of Godly power.And, if you like horror movies for the creativity of deaths scenes used, then Final Destination is surely your thing. Everybody almost loved the first one and criticized the rest but I have to disagree. The first one has presented the basis for the idea but the rest worked on the originality of deaths methods and here I have to say that I liked them all and the most violent one for me is the second.",8,0,1,13 October 2009
The Matrix," 50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!
","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!",10,18,29,30 March 2009
The Proposal," A Sandra Bullock kind of movie...
","It's not a good movie and I was disappointed that Ryan Reynolds has done because he is too good for such movies! I'd love to see this guy given bigger chances. He is a decent actor and has so much capabilities. I liked him so much in the role of Mr. D in 'School of life', he definitely promises to be one of the sparkling stars in the future. As for Sandra, she is a likable character and I guess everybody likes her. This movie role is made for her, though I would like to see her in something new, something more challenging on the acting level and more shocking on the viewer's level. Re the story/movie, it's not a good movie when it comes to romantic comedies like '10 days to lose a guy', 'Hitch', 'Truth About Cats and Dogs', 'The Marrying Man', etc.",5,1,1,18 November 2009
The Wizard of Oz," It's a movie to watch first when you are 10 yrs old and then it becomes a classic for you
","It's one of the classics that you can enjoy if you have watched when you were a kid and then you'd enjoy having a blast from the past with your family.It's definitely one of the movies that I would let my children in the future enjoy just like I did when I was young. You know these movies that parents watch and let their children do as well as if it's a family ritual or something (like 'Sound of Music', 'Christmas Carol', 'Home Alone', etc...)To wrap it all, it's a movie that everybody else has seen, almost a 100 years old (I mean for God's sake it was made in 1939)!, it's one of the classics, so you just can't let it pass without you seeing it.",7,0,2,18 November 2009
