Resident Evil: Afterlife," They should have stopped after the 3th movie
","First of all, I am a fan of the first 3 movies but this one is just bad. I don't want to wast to much time on this review, so I'm just going to put all the arguments why you shouldn't watch this movie in order.1. The special effects are worse then ever.2. The acting is surely not as good as in the previous movies. 3. The storyline is becoming crap.4. The last action scene is like a cheap rip-off of The Matrix. 5. Icould go on but I already wrote too much on this peace of garbage.My advice: don't waste your time!",1,3,7,9 August 2014
