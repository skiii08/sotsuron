Ali," Not what was expected.
",I was very disappointed in this movie. I was expecting to learn about the man and the boxer and instead I got a lesson in 60's music and jumpy camera shots. I think they missed so much of this great man's life and personality. They dont go into enough detail about anything really. Not how he became muslim or about his relationships or his boxing career. The best part was the relationship between Ali and Cossell. Will Smith did a good job with what he was given to work with but I just feel there could have been so much more.,Null,0,0,12 June 2002
