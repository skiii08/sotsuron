The Blair Witch Project," Epilepsy brilliantly put on celluloid
","I was just wondering, what kind of documentary were these guys trying to shoot?If I was a film student shooting on 16mm, I would avoid filming my crew walking around and bitchin'(as in the first 45mins.) at all cost. Film stock is expensive, you know... By the way, was it just me, or did the camera shake just as badly in the first half of the movie as it did when they REALLY had something to be shaky about?Oh, there's something else bugging me here. I'm reading tons of rave reviews on the net about 'Blair Witch' being totally original and all - none of the (I guess mostly) kids praising 'Blair Witch' ever mentioned 'Cannibal Holocaust' NONE!If you wanna see a really creepy, well done fake documentary, watch this instead (second half of movie), but be warned - there's the slight possibility of you puking your guts out...ciao bambini",Null,0,1,5 September 1999
