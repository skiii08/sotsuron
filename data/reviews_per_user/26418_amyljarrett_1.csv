Walk the Line," Extra is amazing!
","There is an extra in Walk the Line that does the most amazing job I have ever seen! During the scene at the awards show, there in an extra that sits behind Johnny Cash's family. His performance is almost breathtaking. He is so interested in what is going on and makes me believe that I was actually sitting in that room. He is in other scenes in the movie, but this one was the best! Reese and Jaquin were very good too, but he took the show! I think that the directors should have given him a speaking part. I have done extensive research to find out who he is. His name is Danny and that is all that I could find. If anyone out there has any information on him, please, please, please send it to me. I would love to follow his success. Watch out Hollywood! This extra is coming to get you!",10,1,2,25 February 2006
