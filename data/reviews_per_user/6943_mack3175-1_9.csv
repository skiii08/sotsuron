Kill Bill: Vol. 2," QUENTIN TARANTINO KNOWS HOW TO DELIVER.
","Kill Bill was supposed to be one film, but Quentin Tarantino felt the was movie to long, so split the movie into two volumes. If it was just one movie, it probably would have been as long has Lord Of The Rings. This movie is very different from Vol. 1. Has the bride(Uma Thurman) slowely closes in on Bill(well acted by David Carradine). Mr. Tarantino pays homage to more of the 70's, if you look carefully at a few idems. In the first Bill was just voice off camera, but in this one he is front and center. Michael Madsen was also good(his character was about has sadistic as Mr. Blonde was from Reservoir Dogs). Daryl Hannah was also good has one eyed killer. To the viewers if you loved Vol.1, then you will love Vol.2.",Null,0,1,29 April 2004
Miracle," The true event that made you believe in a miracle.
","Not since Rudy, there has been a sports movie that touches our heart so much. It takes us back to 1979, where Herb Ross(Terrificly well acted by Kurt Russell) is picked to coach a U.S.A. hockey team to play the undefeted Russia. To do so, he must esemble a team of eager young men, and put them through a grueling practise. Has he tries to show them, that hardwork will pay off in the end. This was the best sports movie I've seen so far. Not just the hockey scenes, but the actors themselves seem to give great performance, even Kurt Russell, who I thought did'nt just act the part, he became Herb Ross. I hope he gets nominated for an oscar. A truly great film about a true event.",Null,0,0,11 April 2004
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man spins his web and delivers another hit.
","What made Peter Parker/Spider-Man so interesting is that he was a superhero with everyday problems, that is why some of the comic book readers can relate to him so well. The movie takes place with Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) who has trouble keeping a job, his grades in college are declining, and has trouble keeping up with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). And why, because he is off saving the city from criminals has the web slinging Spider-Man. The pressure of it all begins to catch up with Peter Parker and decides to retire from being Spider-Man. Meanwhile Dr. Otto Octaivus(Alfred Molina) experiment with fusion and mechanical arms go awry. And becomes Dr. Octapus. And begins to cause mayhem in the city. Will Peter stop him in time? A truly great superhero film. It really shows that being a superhero is'nt fun and games at all. James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris(Aunt May) all give awesome performances. But it is Tobey Maguire's performance that was good he makes it allmost tearjerky. So does Alfred Molina has the villianous and tourterd Doc Oct, he was almost has memorable Willem Dafoes Green Goblin.",Null,0,0,2 July 2004
"I, Robot"," QUITE AN EXCITING RIDE.
","A cool new look in the future, of the possiblity that how robots could be our friends. This film takes place in the year 2035, Detective Del Spooner(the ever so impersive Will Smith) has a personal hatred for robots, that came from a tragedy, which is now become a waking nightmare he can't seem to wake up from. Then he ask to come at a crime scene where a friendly robot scientists(James Cromwell) died from fallen from a high story building. Some say he commited suicide. But Del believes he was probably thrown. When Del catches a robot running from the scene. He soon believes that robot killed him. But everybody says the robots are our friends. Has he begins to investigate, to many turns begin to unravil. A really good sci-fi thriller. It is more then a action flick, it is also a conspiracy movie. Awesome effects and action. And terrific acting by Will Smith. Please you won't be dissapointed.",Null,0,0,18 July 2004
Van Helsing," If Blade and The Punisher had the same father, it would be Van Helsing.
","They just turned the infamous vampire hunter into a comic book like character. An awesome movie, where most of the dialoge is mostly annoying to listen to. But it's the action and the special effects that seem to make up more that. Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman) is a monster hunter, who works for a secret order by the church. Is asked to travel to a different country, to fight a vampire menace named Dracula(Richard Roxburgh), and he teams up with another vampire hunter(Kate Beckinsale) in hopes of destroying this menace of evil. An enjoyable film, Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale have incredible chemistry. It's like this movie was homage to those monster movies of 30s and 40s. It was quite an enjoyable ride.",Null,0,0,7 May 2004
Collateral," IT'S GONNA BE A LONG NIGHT.
","The most interesting story I've seen in years. Tom Cruise makes his performance has a no feeling contract killer, who half of the time shows his likable side, quite watchable. The film is dark and edgy. It starts out with Max(the ever so talented Jamie Fox) a happy go lucky cab driver. Who after having an amusing ride with a beautiful lawyer(Jada Pickett Smith). Picks up Vincent(very well acted By Tom Cruise) and drives to his stop, but Vincent offers Max 5 thousand dollars, to drive him to a few stops. But when someone turns up dead at one of the stops. Max soon discovers that Vincent is a hitman, and thus begins a night where you fear that you may not see tommorow. An enjoyable thriller. Jamie Foxx was great, and so was Tom Cruise. An intense film with it's share of humor. Tom Cruise was a good bad guy.",Null,0,0,6 August 2004
Hellboy," Within darkness a hero will emerge.
","Hellboy is so tough, I believe he can teach Mr.T a thing or too. Comic books have gone quite bonanza on the big screen, with Blade, X-Men SpiderMan, Blade 2, Daredevil, X-Men 2, The Hulk, and the soon to released The Punisher, and SpiderMan 2. It seems like comicbooks will live on forever in movies . Ron Perlman seems perfectly cast has Hellboy, who was born a demon, but raised by a government to be a good guy. He also has amazing powers, he has a Snake Pliskin like attitude. But an ancient evil wants Hellboy to create hell on earth. And what happens next will be the exciting part that I won't give away, you'll half to see the movie. Ron Perlman just became Hellboy when the cameras started rolling. I could'nt think of no one else who could be has good. And director Guillermo Del Toro(Blade 2) knows how to excite the audience. Please I hope there will be a sequel?",Null,0,0,2 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Man I'm sorry, I missed this in theaters.
","This movie had it all, great action, great characters, and it was very visual, and it was very violent. But hay it's Quentin Tarantino. I always like the way in almost all his films he pays homage to the 70's. And this film was no exception. Check out an certain outfit Uma Thurman wears. This is Quentin Tarantinos homage to those 70's martial arts movies. It starts a former pregnant hitwoman(the lovely Uma Thurman) wants to settle down and get married. But her wedding turns into a bloody shoot out, by her former employer named Bill(the well spoken David Carradine) and his group of killers(Vivica A, Fox, Lucy Lu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah). Has four years pass, and she awakens, and will go on a quest making sure they will all suffer for what they did to her. The best film I've seen in a while. It also had witty dialoge, the way Taratino knows how to deliver. It also tries not to be a simple revenge story. It goes in depth of the characters drive. Make way for Vol. 2",Null,0,1,28 April 2004
Dodgeball," Get ready to DODGE, and have fun.
","This movie has brief gross gags, funny one liners, that would make you bust a gut laughing. Also surprise guest stars that would make your eyes bug up. Do not take this movie seriously, if you do then you'll have problems. It all starts with Peter LaFLeur(Vince Vaughn) the owner of The Average Joe's gym, who finds out he must a five thousand dollar loan, or the crazy moronic owner of Global gym who is named White Goodman(the very funny Ben Stiller) will take control of all of it. Just when Peter nearly decides to throw in the towel. One of his friends thought maybe they should enter a Dodgeball tournament. But White Goodman and his team are entering also. Former Dodgeball champion(Rip Torn) offers to train them. The funniest movie I've seen in a while, I don't think I've laughed so hard since Kung Pow. For viewers I'll say one thing, sit back laugh and have fun.",Null,0,0,25 June 2004
