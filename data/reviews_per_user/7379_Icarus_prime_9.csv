Casablanca," La La Land before La La Land even existed...74 years ago.
","The enduring universal appeal of Casablanca lies within its classic Hollywood narrative style, with archetypal characters and plot beats that's as straightforward as what they represent for a romance movie.I have a certain fondness for romantic movies with bittersweet resolutions because that's when the movie can showcase a wide range of complex emotions for the characters and from the audience; neither simply riding off the sunset or all doom and gloom.Yes, everyone knows that the movie is about sacrificing love for the greater good, as heartbreaking as it may be. We observe that with sympathy within Rick and later Llsa. I think that's the main aspect the audience cheers for, not simply the romance between Rick and Llsa because the movie is too important for that. I wonder if some might interpret the love between them back in Paris is just all fleeting; a way to overcome (or rather forget) another heartbreak. A cruel cycle no doubt.The actions by the characters in Casablanca seem flawed because they themselves are flawed. But we must also remember that it also makes sense from a narrative perspective given how Rick used to be a freedom fighter. And yet, what stirred my heart and I'm sure for a lot of people is that despite the logic, our emotions can't help but disagree, just like Llsa later on. So it's essential a role reversal in how the characters feel by the end of the movie.From what I said in the first paragraph, La La Land owes a great deal to Casablanca.",8,1,1,16 August 2017
In Bruges," The path to redemption can be both wickedly humorous and depressing
","In Bruges has one of the best cathartic endings I've seen for a movie.It was executed in a way that it changes the entire outlook of the movie's first half where the narrative seemed simple at a surface- level. Yet the emotions will certainly run deep upon viewing it on retrospective.It's deeply admirable that a comedy like this that is often bitingly unapologetic and dark can be fused with the movie's humorous yet tragic examination of a man's inner turmoil, guilt, one's sin and his path to redemption through means of finding his own sanctuary (through ironic terms).",8,0,0,13 November 2017
Wind River," A terrifically cool Jeremy Renner performance makes this a riveting humane crime drama
",Jeremy Renner in this movie plays a role similar of Morgan Freeman in Se7en; both have a apathetic sense of understanding of what and where they inhabit that is unpleasant and undesirable.There are a few human interaction scenes throughout the movie with his character that illustrate this with some excellent dialogue alongside a isolated snowy backdrop. The latter makes this feeling more apparent thanks to its striking cinematography and the movie rewards viewers to look at the movie through this lense. The world-building and atmosphere are almost the main characters itself.I personally felt the actual crime and mystery was less than compelling and hits all the similar plot beats for its genre that you see in most other movies.,7,1,3,13 November 2017
Se7en," A grisly, visceral hard-boiled thriller with a superb ending
","This is a perfect example where a movie is good and/or got better due to its ending. Three-quarters of the whole film is pretty much stock standard crime, mystery thriller and the 'senior-rookie' relationship between the characters that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt portray is straightforward but not generic and narrow-minded since their chemistry is so natural. The reason for the latter is that the character, Mills while impulsive, his short-tempered and foul-mouth personality doesn't detract his presence and overall viewing experience of the movie. He's kept in check by William; the archetypal 'calm and collected veteran' but during moments like these, they actually have interesting, contrasting discussions in how they see the world, the people and the crimes within a detective's perspective. The film sets up so they avoid Mills' emotional outcries as the focus of the scene which I appreciate. It makes Mills a more multi-dimensional character because we can clearly see him and William are presented as different people on the surface. But the film takes an effort to establish how they're different. The actual methods and scenes of the murders are indeed quite graphic but the most effective and disturbing one takes place at the end. It's the classic case of not showing that makes it more frightening because it's when our endless imagination takes stage. Speaking of the ending, the reason I view it with high praise is because it's not phoned in and artificial. The film put in some key clues in earlier scenes to justify the killer's methods validly. Its impact is strengthen by the fact that the serial killer is shown quite early and the film uses the remaining sequences well to establish the character. Of course, the actor that plays the killer at the end puts on a a remarkable, chilling performance that only makes the last quarter of the movie better. Normally, the 'mystery' aspect to a film like this would be gone and thus detract our enjoyment (Julia's Eyes is an example that it did) but it didn't for me because we're clearly more interested by the end of WHY the killer kills. It's a natural, organic progression when we're all sucked in to the elaborate ways that the victims are killed at the start. While the actual killer's motivations is a little simple- minded and its all explained in one convenient scene, I just love how the VERY last sequence of the movie refused to venture on a black-and-white 'good guys beat bad guys' type of ending and sticked to its guns on what the film is about by using the killer as the subtext. Overall, I enjoyed this modern hard-boiled flick and the only problems I had with the movie is that its a little too reliant on the ending to be a deciding factor on whether or not you would enjoy this picture. Lastly, when I referred to the killer's intentions as slightly one-sided, I felt like it was a bit self-indulgent at times and wasn't all-encompassing enough when the film needed to foreshadow more on its underlying message during sections of the film before the killer was revealed. We only see a few glimpses from the interactions between Freeman and Pitt as well as the dark, grim setting (neo-noir) portrayed in the movie but I need more still. I thought if the film executed on the 'why' part of the killings a bit better and not just 'how' (which I already explained it's done admirably) then it would've easily pushed my rating from a 8.5/10 to a 9 or higher.",8,2,3,20 May 2016
Zootopia," The best Disney movie since The Lion King.
","As expected from an animated picture of Disney's caliber, I like it a lot. The animation and the different settings they showed throughout the movie were amazing; the chemistry between Judy and Nick was interesting enough. The anthropomorphic characters are entertaining because they're relatable and the film balances the human elements with the whole 'animal world' very well. I think that's where the film shines the most and hence the high reviews it's getting. Usually for Disney films (and even Pixar) they only focus on one aspect; human condition or a fantasy premise. So you can say Zootopia is sort of breaking new ground by trying to do both. The only comparison I can think of that tries to match what Zootopia is doing is Pixar's Monsters Inc.Of course, like most good Disney pictures where it can be appreciated by both kids and adults alike; but through other reasons, Zootopia's brilliance lies in the important message that the film offers. It's straight-forward since aspects of it such as the 'under-dog' story is something you see in a lot of animated movies. However, I liked how the plot manages to develop beyond that into a/the bigger picture.My only criticisms about the movie is the humor might not cut through enough to people as it's mostly witty banter and subversive. Besides that, I think a film like Zootopia, it would work MUCH BETTER as a Pixar film rather than a Disney film.Pixar films like Inside Out and Wall-E manages to deal with important themes more intelligently than Disney films like Zootopia while at the same time making the film entertaining to watch as an animation. I'm not saying those 2 films are necessarily better than Zootopia; but I'm saying they (Pixar) handle the aspect of trying to get a real-life applicable point across better. Personally for me, I prefer it when the film doesn't info-dump you with stale exposition especially if it's within one scene and keep the subtext conveying subtle across the whole picture. It might sound contradictory to what my main point is compared to the end of my opening paragraph since relating to that, I know the film-makers were trying to mesh out both a dazzling and subversive animated flick but the 2nd half of the film greatly focuses on the latter aspect. So my first impression when I was watching the ending was it tried to 'hammer in' too much on the human subtext and should've mix it up with the fun animated stuff like in the middle parts of the film. To sum up what I'm saying, the tone of the climax (of the film) could've been handled a bit better so that way Zootopia's themes can be addressed as a wider scope for an enhancing experience.Overall, this film is on my top 10 list of my favourite animated movies and I enjoyed the technical merits more than my own personal enjoyment of the film since the humour didn't strike me that well at times. And to be honest, the funniest scene in Zootopia was already shown in the preview trailers (which I saw prior). I still found it hilarious the second time when watching the actual movie. So maybe that's actually a compliment to the execution of the film's humour despite what I said otherwise earlier? Zootopia is quite possibly the best Disney movie of the last decade since The Lion King.",9,4,9,4 May 2016
Zodiac," A slow burner serial killer movie that focuses more on 'police procedural work'
","This is a slightly overlooked Fincher film that was very tense and totally engrossed me all the way through. For a serial killer mystery movie, what's so thrilling about it is that it defies all the typical Hollywood clichés for its genre, such as chases and blood & gore and sticks to the grounded reality tone with all the police investigative procedural work. It's a type of movie that feels like that it could actually happen in real life, which the movie indeed is based on for the subject manner and that's what makes it so scary for me.",8,0,0,2 December 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino dishes out the coldest revenge flick of them all
","I was reminded once again throughout watching this movie of Tarantino's apparent 'foot fetish', like all his other pictures with those close-up perversions. I'll be like, 'Say what!?' No matter. It only seems like his idiosyncrasies only serve proof to his leaps of genius towards his 'all-style' approach. But he is more than that. At the same time when those scenes happen (very few luckily), I was reminded yet another thing that Tarantino confidently strikes away the convention that most movies seem to have to choose between action or ideas, style or substance. It is rare for a great movie to do both but it's even rarer that a great movie can balance it with clarity and equilibrium. That elevates a 'great' movie to a 'masterpiece'. Take for example of those brief scenes where the 'Bride' sees in viewing distance of her target for vengeance after a quick cut into an overshadow flashback with urgent sounds of the importance and the actions of that target in the past. This is an action flick after all and the general audience doesn't want to waste time with stagnant, regurgitated exposition dialogue to sacrifice the pacing and momentum of the film's kinetic rhythm. Tarantino respects the audience and hence respects their intelligence for films. This intelligence is matched by the man himself. There's without question that he loves and knows the movies, and he exuberantly indulgences those classical homages and tropes as a celebration of the medium; but it always comes second to his classic Tarantino 'flavour' style. We always get a sense of his auteur; his personal creative vision that he's willing to transcend those references into something new and true. And that's the heart of where Kill Bill lies in. Just like so many of his other films, every scene sequence is so meticulously crafted with a sense of purpose and relevance the story and plot while at the same time, being polished to look as vintage as the Bride's 'Pussy Wagon' vehicle, to give a childlike curiosity and enthusiasm for the movies-lovers to say 'Hey! I know this reference and where it comes from!' Here's another example of how Tarantino loves to toy with the audience through creating and alternating subversive film expectations: the climax scene of the movie where the Bride fights off the Yakuza bodyguards at the restaurant. Notice how in the first sequence, Bride is only fighting one opponent at the time in a gauntlet-like fashion. There's absolutely no sense of logic in that (why not have all of them fight her at the same time?) which unsurprisingly is found in most action flicks but Tarantino makes us waitonly to spectacularly unleash us the remaining army soon afterwards with a proper sense of logic and purpose. Tarantino isn't afraid to indulge in experimenting a multitude of styles in respects to the Japanese setting of the movie such as an- anime inspired sequence of O-Ren's backstory; an origin so violent and hyper-stylised that it's almost a disservice if it was live- action as it would dampen its aesthetic appeal. While the previously mentioned fighting climax scene at the restaurant incorporates a black-and- white photography and blue silhouette in order to maximise the 'rule of cool' formula. But it's simply because it had to get pass the censors (unfortunately). Above all, a Tarantino movie wouldn't be a Tarantino movie without the use of non-linear narrative. He uses it to great effect in the beginning with the circular narrative going forwards and backwards to add a human element to 'The Bride', her motivations and a reason why we want to see the 'revenge' part from the revenge flick in the first place. I'm sure actual 'revenge' in real life is wrong itself. If we disregard the argument of 'genre' preferences, sometimes it is how the movie is about and not what it's about. As said before, he doesn't forget the story because he believes an action sequences work better in the service of and around the plot; not the other way. Otherwise, having it backwards gives the illusion of fight- scenes as 'stiff' and scripted. It's not a coincidence there's chapter titles within the film in the first place.In worst case scenario, Tarantino's over- indulgence might've been too apparent and the story (and structure) would've been nothing more than a technical exercise. Remember, even with most action movies, there's more minutes spent on the non-action scenes than the actual action scenes. Hence, the pacing and effect of the action scenes would be more effective if it had a coherent context in the first place. Ironically, Tarantino's greatest achievement from this movie is making us forget about this in the first place. That is the sensation he creates. Isn't that why we go to a movie in a first place?",9,0,2,9 September 2016
Sinister," Some interesting horror ideas tossed around without any purpose
","Throughout the entire movie, I was waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did. Watching this reminded me why I decided to watch more Asian horror films these days. They're way better in terms of building an atmosphere. I particularly have a disdain for horror movies that uses situations where the characters are predictably gonna get involved in bad situations. Although this movie wasn't a huge offender for this since the crux of the film is actually quite interesting, I wish they executed the inner conflict of Ethan Hawke's character better. He makes a lot of dumb decisions throughout (aka Plot Induced Stupidity) but I will praise once again on the neat idea of a guy dedicating his life to expressing horrific stories actually getting involved in one himself. The movie follows all your typical horror clichés such as the classic 'home invasion at night' style of environment and some cheap jump-scares (the ending one was pretty lame) and fake jump-scares. At least the supernatural aspects of this picture weren't that distracting for me. I have no idea who on earth was the costume/makeup designer for this movie because they did a really abysmal job and made the movie a lot less creepy when the actual horror scenes came. I didn't even care THAT much about the ending either even when it was quite refreshing since it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Also I felt like all this bizarre religious occult reference symbolisms near the end felt incredibly tacked on to the movie. Kind of sad since it ultimately ended up relying on it as the foundation of the whole movie.Overall, I found the movie to be a bit disappointing and everything that featured within Sinister was done without a sense of purpose; just a bunch of ideas being thrown in just for the sake of it (my biggest problem with this 'horror' movie). Even worse that the all the ingredients to make a good horror: Atmosphere (obviously), a coherent story and scares (duh) were nearly non-existent when being meshed together.Oh did I forget to mention the film isn't even that scary? A few attempted jump scares ain't going to cut it for me. Actually, I'm more impressed with horror movies if they don't use it in the first place which the movie did in some parts. But it wasn't enough.",6,0,0,25 May 2016
Whiplash," Push It To The Limit
","Whiplash is unrelenting and single-minded in its focus, and all the better for it. This could've easily backfire with other films if there are certain elements of the movie that feel undeveloped. Yet, this movie purposely sidesteps this by using it in service of the movie's narrowing conflict and its intensity. Consider how the movie's romance between the main character and his love interest seems tacked on and ends in a giant halt. From the main character's perspective, it's the ambition, the obsession, the sacrifices to make in achieving the all-conquering 'success'. But at what cost? Yes, the movie at the surface centers around Jazz and drumming. These are depicted through sublime film editing with rhythmic-like cuts and transitions in synchronizing with the music being played and the musician's performance themselves.But it's not the subject. It's a supplier for these themes which is executed with ferocious passion through scenes with J.K Simmons role as Fletcher. He has a screen presence that commands attention; always ready with his coiled up brutality inside of him that's waiting to be unleashed at any moment to his.Fletcher is entertaining just as he's frightening. We are not supposed to laugh at these caustic verbal abuse by Fletcher to everyone. But the brilliance of J.K Simmons performance can be summed up where he throws and hurls his insults with such biting creativity that even Gordon Ramsay might send some flowers. I guess this is the film's way in making him redeemable alongside his harsh, cold yet BELIEVABLE (key word) intentions that keep him from making the character completely insufferable.We already know Andrew is ambitious himself such as his response to lack of social interest as an obstacle, his subtle smirks in his expression whenever his drumming rivals fails and his condescending remarks in the dinner scene. And yet, the main relationship of the movie is between the main character, Andrew and Fletcher which is clearly abusive and toxic. It's curious to see how over the course of the movie, the main character, Andrew, slowly becomes a reflection (or product) of Fletcher in matching his menacingly perfectionist ideal.It's bewildering that with Whiplash's premise, it can generate such intensity and ferocity where every musicians are performing as if their life is on the line; camera close-up shots continually focus on their hands trembling, sweats all over them. Even most action movies that's more advantageous in generating these emotions, don't match Whiplash's emotional impact.",9,0,0,17 October 2017
