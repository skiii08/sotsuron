Hereditary," Seriously intense!
","I heard a lot of hype about the movie, saying it was one of the scariest in years. Heard that before. Saw the trailer play over and over on youtube, looked kinda bland horror... Then finally decided to watch it one evening...I had to pause the movie three times to get a grip on my emotions. Toni's performance was nothing short of miraculous.
*SPOILERS AHEAD*Her screams and wails after Charlie dies is absolutely heart-wrenching. You can hear her sorrow and pain and suffering. The acting was all very superb and amazing. At times I truly wondered if Annie was just losing her mind or if things were really happening. The climax of the movie felt so horrifying on psychological level.This is one of the few movies I dont want to ever watch again.",10,3,4,23 July 2019
