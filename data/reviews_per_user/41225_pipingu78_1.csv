Captain Phillips," I don't agree with this movie
","Its funny i just watched Hijacking 'The crew of a Danish cargo ship is hijacked by Somali pirates who proceed to engage in escalating negotiations with authorities in Copenhagen.' this one seems to be a remake.. A remake but without this little hand made touch from the original one, even if they took a hand camera to shoot it, its looking made in Hollywood, its looking too clean and too 'plastic'. sorry i cannot agree on this one i don't understand why the note is so high like most of the recent movies. Its clearly a money maker remake movie. I give it a 2 for the somalian actors sad",2,15,41,24 October 2013
