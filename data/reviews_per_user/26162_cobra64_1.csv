The New World," mind numbingly boring
","'Wanna go to a movie' says the voice on the other end of the phone line. 'sure' I respond. 'you choose' he says. My choice for this evening was The New World. bad...bad choice. I should have stayed home and watched hockey on TV. this movie was so BORING I have a hard time explaining. Really, so brutally, mind-numbingly boring. I think I was in the theatre for 4 or 5 hours, at least if felt like it. Like many others, I should have walked, but I kept thinking...no it can't be this bad...it has to pick up. It didn't. There were a couple of things that COULD have redeemed this movie. First, the lead girl. She was pretty Hot. That being said...didn't see enough skin. that would have at least kept the male audience entertained. a couple times the director teases you and makes you think your gonna sneak a peak...but like everything else about this movie...it leaves you disappointed. Secondly, Battle scenes. there was one, it sucked. how you can shoot people, club them with mallets, and spear them, and not get any blood on you...i'm not sure.Actually there was one good thing about this movie. The indians bring the British bastards some meat in the winter time...they managed to bring in a real nice buck. and a big 'ol turkey. that was neat.The music was I think one 45 second clip, and every time music was cued up it was the Same thing. and it wasn't even good.The cinematography was good sure, but even that got old about 10 minutes in.Bottom line: Crap Movie",1,7,18,21 January 2006
