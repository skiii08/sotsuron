Casablanca," A Fantastic Movie
","What can you really say to describe such a perfect classic movie? If you have to watch one movie from this era, my recommendation would always be Casablanca. It has romance, politics, comedy, action, drama... everyone can find something about this movie to like. Except maybe horror movie fanatics. Bergman and Bogart give fantastic performances and there's a chemistry between them that really makes the lost romance believable.The movie is meant as a commentary on America joining WWII, set just before Pearl Harbor and would have been extremely relevant and emotional for the first audiences. As a modern viewer, it's not emotional in the same ways, because we are separated from the political conflict of entering WWII, but in the time period, even the cast was emotional during the singing of the national anthems.",10,1,2,19 October 2012
