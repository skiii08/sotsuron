"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," The best feel-good movies i know.
","I have seen this 20+ times and it is still a 10 in my book of feel-good movies. Pegg, Black and Schwimmer did it and should do it again. A good movie is a movie that give you some thing to go when it ends. One of the best actor turning director debut. Not a Friend's fan so did not expect much from this. Totally surprised. Some times I laugh at the characters, like when Pegg and Moran fight on their way out from the crocked piano dealers. Most of the time one laugh at the things that hit close to home. The recognition is spotted here and there. It is not a deep movie with extraordinary acting performances. It is in the more plain depiction side of the art where we find ordinary characters being ordinary end experiencing extraordinary ordinary circumstances. It feels effortless but it is the key to its magic. It pulls the audience in instead of just exposing its content to them. There is no threshold between the story and reality. For one and a half hour the audience and the characters story is the same.",10,0,0,9 March 2020
American Sniper," A hero is not a hero because he say he is.
","It is my respect for the quality craftsmanship that is put in to this movie that makes me rate this movie high as 2/10. The purpose of this movie and the lies it is built up on makes it dangerous in the making of our history. This movie will be there forever telling lies by a man about him and about a war. What the war was about and why American soldiers died on foreign land and why American soldiers killed people in another country. This is nothing else than propaganda showing it's ugly face and I'm so sorry that Clint Eastwood is the director. There are so many stories true to the American nation, it's values and it's youth that sacrificed their lives for it. The true testimonies and stories takes away the need of this story and this movie. The need of this move did never exist. Now this movie is made and we will all have to accept its role as a part of our historical legacy. It will always be known it is built upon lies but also hailed to in expression of patriotism. How sad. All the respect I had for Mr Eastwood is gone. It saddens me that this movie profoundly redefines Mr Eastwood in my point of view. A movie should not need to be rated like this. A movie should be rated for its story, the artistry, the craftsmanship and its visualizations of its makers. But when a movie crosses the line from being a pure work of art to become a tool for other interests... it is the other interests that will be judged. 2 out of 10 only because of respect for the artists.",2,3,32,16 March 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Movie magic without a bunny in the hat.
","A good movie is not the same as a well made one. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a good example of a well-made production, but it is not enough. There is nothing to object to the production, the actors etc. What separates Once Upon a Time in Hollywood from a good movie is what you bring from the movie. Previous Tarantino films have in most cases shown the filmmaker's talent in just leaving a lasting imprint. How he has managed to create 2.5 hours of cinematic brilliance without any significant amount of content is puzzling. It may be a talent or the movie is a failure.
I had to see it again. Maybe I had a mini stroke the first time I saw it because the emptiness after the movie might indicate that I may have had a mini stroke or something similar. So I spent about 5 hours and 20 minutes trying to find the greatness of the film. Nothing. The film is like a fireplace video.
It feels sad to give such a well-played and well-made movie so few stars but if I'm honest, 3 out of 10 still feel generous in this case.Big names and hype will probably entice many viewers to waste several hours of their lives watching this movie. A small number of fans will be lyrical, but I think most will leave the movie theater with a void in their life history that will be difficult to explain even if quantum physics is used.",3,3,7,1 February 2020
