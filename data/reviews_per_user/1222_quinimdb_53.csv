Black Swan," Black Swan
","'Black Swan' is actually an adaptation of the play Swan Lake. I know that would seem obvious to you if you haven't seen the film, but many believe the play is only a plot device in the film to trigger her eventual descent into insanity. But as Thomas Leroy states early in the film, Swan Lake is 'Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real.' And that's exactly what the film does. Rather than being the actual play, it becomes a dark character study and psychological thriller, but it still follows the same story.The film begins similar to the play, with a prelude where the spell is cast on Nina Sayers, our main character. This spell is not a literal one however, but rather the curse of the play, and how it changes her. I believe she is split into three parts, and these are represented by the characters Beth Macintyre, Erica Sayers, and, of course, The Black Swan. Erica, her mother, is the side of her that demands perfection, and wants to keep her innocence in order to stay focused. The Black Swan is the side of her that wants to lose her innocence and embrace her imperfection, and basically say 'live a little.' Beth Macintyre is the side of her that realizes her imperfections and punishes herself for them. Thomas Leroy is what she wants to be. He is perfection for the play. He knows exactly what he needs to be and when. This is represented by Nina peeing standing up towards the beginning of the film, and when she has sex with The Black Swan in a dream and confronts her the next day about it, but The Black Swan says 'Not unless you have a penis and your name is Tom.' She seems to be referring to the man named Tom whom they met the night before, but who else is named Tom? Thomas Leroy. These sides of her are also represented by the colors black and white, which are important in the film. The Black Swan, Erica, and Beth all wear black throughout the film, showing that they are the negative aspect in her and the struggle between them is what eventually drives her insane. Thomas Leroy usually wears gray, or both white and black at once, showing that he has both the black swan and the white swan in him, but, unlike Nina, he has it in perfect balance, there is no struggle within him. She tries to get rid of all three sides of her, but once she finally does it, she realizes they are still there, and don't seem to be leaving anytime soon, so the only way to freedom (and perfection) is suicide, just as the white swan in the play.",10,1,3,26 July 2016
Come and See," Come and See
","'Come and See' is unbelievably powerful. No film has ever explored the horrors of war so relentlessly and realistically as this film, and I don't know if I'll ever watch it again, yet I think everyone should watch it once.When a young boy finds an old rifle, he decides to join the war against Nazi Germany. He is as naive as any boy at his age, and much to his mother's dismay, he joins, not really knowing what to expect.He is left behind by the army, because they know how young and foolish he is. He is left with a girl, who he comes to care about. They experience a terrifying and incredibly realistic looking (and sounding) bombing, seemingly out of no where, with only a glimpse of a plane beforehand to warn them. The boy remains hopeful that he can save her and find his family, and the boy and girl both begin to laugh and dance to distract themselves from the horror that they are in the midst of. Then they get back to the boys home.The town seems abandoned. The boy goes into his house to find his sisters' dolls splayed out on the floor with bugs buzzing around them. He finds food in the oven and remains hopeful that they are just off somewhere else. The girl sees the dolls and is disturbed. The boy is terrified but comes back and continues to convince himself his family is just off somewhere.Then we see them dead. All of them. Leaning against the back of the house. Only the girl does however, so the boy keeps running. He gets to a thick bog. He slowly treks along the bog. He struggles and struggles and struggles with the girl holding onto the back of him for what seemed like minutes, probably do to the long slow single shot it was filmed in. Then they arrive at the other end, and the boy must finally face the fact his parents are dead.He blames himself for all of this, and as devastating as this is for him, he still clings desperately to his rifle. He is therefore brought along on a trip to get food and milk. He begins to laugh again. Harder than ever, trying to shield himself from the horrors of his situation. In another reminder of his reality, 2 of the three men he is with are killed by bombs (once again, with the menacing plane warning only seconds before). They continue however, and after stealing the cow successfully (in a long, long POV shot), the boy and the last remaining member have their last moment of joy together, drinking the milk from the cow, laughing, and forgetting about everything but that moment. Then more bombs hit, and more gunfire starts. From this point on, there is no laughing, and no joy left in the movie. Even after he finds out he is alone, he still clings to the cow as his last hope. Then the cow dies.The boy finds a horse and a man, but is eventually captured by Nazis. This whole, next 45 minutes is comprised of almost exclusively long shots, unflinching lyrics staring at the absolute horror of the moment. Words cannot describe it. The boy survives, barely, but the final shot of the scene is worse than death with the boy face down in the dirt, empty, and practically dead inside, or wishing he was.The boy is picked up by the resistance, and we get a disturbing shot of a woman with a white face, bloody lips, and bloody legs, showing the absolute destruction of any thing that was once peaceful or beautiful. The men almost burn the Nazis, but instead men jump in and shoot them last second, showing that they are better than them, even in their most vengeful moments. But this truly means nothing, as we see next. The boy finds a portrait of Adolph Hitler in a wet ditch. He shoots it over and over, as videos of what he has done are reversed, showing how badly he wants to take back what Hitler's done. Then there is a picture of a mother and child. He stops. He realizes no matter what they do at this point, they can never take back what Hitler has done, and that is the depressing and horrifying fact of the Holocaust. The boy may be alive, but, like his gun, he is broken, and always will be, and you can see it in his now deranged face.",10,4,6,16 July 2016
It," It
","For the first 15 minutes of 'It' (and frankly all of the time before that), I thought this film was going to be another pointless remake. Within the first scene, it already felt as if the director was trying way too hard to make things 'scary'. The classic scene where Georgie meets Pennywise the clown not only seemed to be unnecessarily stretched out, but there was a shadow over the top half of Pennywise's face, so all you could see were his glowing eyes. In the build up to this scene Georgie bumps his head into a construction barrier, providing what seemed like unintentional comedy before the scene started. And then there was Bill Skarsgard's performance in this scene, which also felt like he was straining. As the icing on the cake, the scene ends with a predictable jumpscare and an exaggerated amount of blood and gore. Overall, Tim Curry's performance in the original scene along with the quick and sudden end to the scene actually left a much larger impact, having you wonder what exactly happened to Georgie after getting a glimpse of Pennywise's terrifying face.Even though the next few scenes in the school also looked to be following a clich√© and cheesy route, surprisingly I actually began to care about these characters and enjoy watching the dynamics between them. That doesn't mean the overall trajectory of the film isn't still pretty predictable, but the kids acted like real kids of their age, with surprisingly great child performances across the board. The kids curse, joke around, and, when things begin to go down, they are realistically terrified. When the film wasn't trying to be scary, it was often genuinely hilarious, and it made the rest of the film a whole lot more likable.While I still felt that much of the horror was exhausting every trope as an attempt to scare (way too many sharp teeth, missing limbs, and predictable jump scares) and Bill Skarsgard was straining with a one note performance, all of the horror in the film actually serves the story and characters, and it actually has a couple well executed scares and sequences. Also, it's surprisingly disturbing at points, not just showing the irrational fears children have, but real childhood trauma.They call the monster in the film 'It' because it is actually just a representation of their fear, inflicted upon them by overprotective parents, abusive parents, traumatic events, and bullies. Of course, the film makes a point to show that the bullies aren't exempt from this controlling force of fear either, and it is often the reason they need to feed on fear to feel stronger.Of course, like 'The Goonies', 'Stand by Me', or the recent 'Stranger Things', what gets them through their troubles is the care and understanding that they have for each other, and what really makes this rated-R film about a group of children actually relatable for an older audience is how much these kids remind you of yourself at that age.",7,1,8,9 September 2017
Fight Club," Fight Club
","'Fight Club' is a film that went from unknown to a cult film realized for its smart satire to a film with a large following, but loved by many of the people that it satirizes. In a way, this progression reflects the progression of the fight club in the film itself.The film begins as seemingly a satire of consumer culture and our mundane lives. The main character has insomnia and is a slave to consumer culture and his boring 9 to 5 job where he hates his boss. The one frame inserts of Tyler Durden into the narrators boring life show his desperation to escape his routine. He is so desperate in fact that he starts going to support groups after his doctor recommends going to one to understand 'true pain'. He realizes that when people are dying they are so raw and truthful and just don't care about the trivial things that he does, and it makes him feel better. He begins to start sleeping well but a woman that does the same thing as him shows up, except she does it simply because it costs less than a movie and has free coffee, but she reminds him of his own lie. The narrator explains that she knows that she could die at any moment, therefore she does what she wants. His insomnia starts up again. He confronts her and they exchange numbers. From here, it starts to show the narrator wake up on planes in places that he doesn't recognize and he doesn't remember how he got there. He meets various normal people on planes that he calls 'single serving friends'. The most interesting one, however is Tyler Durden. He is cool, different, anti- establishment, and completely aware of all of the trivial things in our daily lives. He points out that there are many safety devices on planes that only exist to make us feel safer. When all of the narrators belongings go up in flames in an apartment fire, he calls Tyler. He doesn't know why, but we know it's because Tyler is subconsciously what the narrator wants to be. While the narrator is sulking about his lost belongings, Tyler shows his distaste for consumer culture. He knows 'what we own can end up owning us'. When they walk outside, Tyler tells the narrator to hit him. Tylers logic is that if he's never gotten in a fight before then how would he know if it was a good thing or not. They fight, and the narrator begins to feel liberated from his boring routine. He moves into a broken down home, and begins to fight more with Tyler. More people see them fighting one night and join. Eventually there is a whole club. Tyler establishes rules (rule number one, you do not talk about fight club), and so far, all this seems logical enough. For one I've never been in a fight, so I wouldn't know how it could feel, and two, I'm sure all of us have thought of breaking from the usual routine. Also, most importantly, Tyler seems cool and smart. But one night when Tyler holds a gun to a man's head, but spares him, and tells him to become a veterinarian (what he is currently in school for) in the next six weeks or he will be dead. We are shocked at first, but Tyler not only gave this man motivation to do what he wants to do with his life, and as he explains 'that mans breakfast will taste better than any other meal we have ever had'. It sounds logical, he made that man appreciate life, but as the next scene shows, he is manipulating us as well as the people in the film. He looks directly into the camera and tells us what he later tells his army as we see the edges of the film roll. We then realize how hypocritical and insane this all is. It is an anarchist and anti- establishment group whose followers are even more brainwashed than the consumers that they were originally mocking. They have a large list of rules and do mindless work and terrorist attacks for a leader that controls them completely. It is both a satire of consumerism and daily life as we're told to live it and the anarchists that it inspires. What it suggests is a balance in which you are not made numb by the mundanes of everyday life, and you don't buy brand name furniture and appliances to make you feel like you have meaning, but you also shouldn't become anarchistic to escape your lifestyle to the point of inciting meaningless violence and having cult like activities. This balance is suggested by the narrator and Marla holding hands at the end.What elevates the film to a 10/10 however, is the commentary on the emasculation of men (specifically through testicular cancer), and what that does to them, and how they come to grips with that. I won't go in depth, as this is already going long, but the very end is great, where the narrator holds Marla's hand as the buildings in front of them collapse, while their pose and clothes mirror each other, with narrator seemingly wearing a dress, showing that he has accepted his feminine side. But, back with the other satire of the film, Tyler seems to have the last word as he corrupts the film, which is ultimately a commercial product (there is even a Pepsi ad in the film as well as noticeable product placement), by inserting a few frames of a penis.",10,0,1,21 June 2016
Monster," Monster
","When you see Aileen Wuornos and hear that she is a Daytona Beach prostitute and serial killer, you would probably expect her to be absolutely out of her mind. And you'd be right, to some extent, but you wouldn't expect that she had big dreams at one point in life, and all she really wanted to do was have one person to love. In fact when she seemed to almost accidentally stumble into becoming a prostitute at a young age, when she dreamed of becoming rich and famous, and expected to just stumble into fame as well. Soon enough she had become a full blown hooker, and she seemed to do the same when she became a serial killer. And Charlize Theron seems to completely inhabit this human being with a damaged soul. She not only physically transformed herself, but mentally as well. She is not the beautiful Charlize Theron that we've seen before. All of the performances in the film are fantastic, but Charlize Theron completely becomes this new person and there's almost no other performance in film that matches her's in this oneSo Aileen's downfall started out when she was trying to get money to share with her new girlfriend, Selby Wall. She was 'hooking' and happened to get into the wrong man's car. She got into the car of a sadistic psychopath, and he rapes her and tortures her, and definitely would've killed her if she didn't kill him first. She hides this from Selby, because she knows Selby is like the old Aileen. Selby believes people are good and Aileen doesn't want to take that away from her. She tries to quit hooking, but discovers she has dug herself too deep into a hole she can't get out of. After being raped and almost murdered, then being rejected by every job because of her lack of credentials, she begins to lose hope in herself. She finally confesses that she murdered the man to Selby, and decides to go back to hooking. But, when she gets in the car with the next man, she seems more nervous, more paranoid. The editing becomes closer and quicker, with intense music in the background, just like it did when she killed the first man. Suddenly she kills the man. She is then at home with Selby, and this is when the guilt begins to eat away at her, but it got them money, and the money gave them happiness, so she continues to kill. We see that she first needs to convince herself that the person is bad in order to kill him, and if she can't do that, she can't kill him. But she begins to kill nicer people, one of them a man that she thinks is out to get her because he has a gun, when it is only revealed that he is a cop. Next she gets in the car of a man that is a genuinely nice person with a family, who doesn't want to hook up with her, yet when he sees her pistol, she feels that she has to kill him, even though she doesn't want to. This is the most painful scene in the movie. From there it is all downhill for Aileen and Selby, and it all culminates to one heartbreaking phone call between Selby and Aileen, when it pans over to show cops in the same room listening to Selby, revealing that Selby is turning her in by getting a confession from her.Was she a bad person? Yes. But she was also genuinely scarred and damaged from a horrible childhood. We learn she was kicked out of her house, beat by her dad, and raped at the age of 8, among other things, yet for a long while she truly believed in herself and that things would get better. The truth is, in the end, all she really wanted was to be with the one person she ever seemed truly loved in the world. This is a hopeless, cynical film, about a similarly hopeless and cynical one, but it is a fantastic and devastating film as well.",9,0,0,30 April 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One
","Coming off the heels of the light and fun 'The Force Awakens', 'Rogue One' is a very different Star Wars film in tone and scale. While there are big battles and big explosions, it's based mostly on one set of characters trying to accomplish one specific mission. The film has a much more muted color palette, and the action sequences are shot like a war film. While I admire the film for trying something new, the characters aren't as enticing as they should be. What is really striking here are the action set-pieces, which are all well directed even if its a bit hard to care about what is happening.The characters are serviceable as vehicles for the story to take place, but there really isn't much there. The film immediately begins with Jyn Erso's father being taken away from her by the imperial forces as she runs off and is saved by Saw Gerrera, played by Forest Whitaker. It then cuts to the future when Jyn is a loner who will do anything to get by. We basically learn she has a rough past and has been left to her own devices, yet she has a deep love for her father, who she hasn't seen in years. When her father becomes involved with the rebellion, Jyn now has motivation to assist them. While she is a good-enough character, and while she is definitely deeper than the other characters (which isn't saying much), she seems pretty cut and dry. The group of characters that band together don't have good enough chemistry to make them interesting or relatable, and Jyn delivers one absolutely cringe-worthy, corny monologue regarding the rebellion.The group is made up of a girl with a tragic past who is motivated to join the rebellion by her father, a guy with a (vague) tragic past who joined the rebellion at age 6 and continues to fight because it gives his life purpose, a blind religious guy who knows how to use the force, a big guy who doesn't believe in the force at first, an eccentric pilot, and a robot who's supposed to be comic relief but fails miserably. They're all pretty much caricatures except the first one, who is still quite boring anyway.The film is held up by its visual design. The movie has absolutely incredible special effects, and it looks maybe even better than 'The Force Awakens'. It contains a perfect mix of CGI and practical effects to where it all blends together seamlessly. The action scenes are well shot and well constructed, such as one scene in which Jyn's father is being interrogated by imperial forces at his base, while Cassian is about to shoot him so he doesn't give away any plans, and Jyn is on the platform and trying to save him, while the rebel attack fleet is coming to blow up that very platform. In this scene, there is a lot going on but I think it was handled rather well. However, it was difficult to tell who was doing what and why during the climax of the film. There were a lot of moments in which a character had to get to one place to push a button, or pull a switch, or plug something in, and while I understood that they were trying to send the Death Star plans to the rebels, I was never sure exactly what significance that button or switch or plug had on the overall goal. Also, many moments during this climax felt forced to get more dramatic effect. Chirrut, the blind guy, and Baze, the big guy, have a moment in which Baze suddenly runs out to Chirrut as he is dying, and they have a heartfelt moment where Baze suddenly starts believing in the force, just, because, I guess. They were polar opposites at the start of the film, yet they have this forced emotional moment, even though the film hadn't really developed their relationship whatsoever. Also, Orson Krennic, the antagonist, has a moment in which he is literally aiming a gun at Jyn, yet he stands there to monologue for a little while, and then listen to her response, even though everything around him is coming down in flames and he has absolutely no reason not to kill her right then. While I'm glad the film had the nerve to literally kill off every main character, which at least gave the characters a sense of vulnerability and tension during the action scenes, the 'war film' vibe that the film goes for is ruined by moments like these. Also, the last few minutes of the film are inexcusable fan service that have no other reason to be in the film.While the film and its writing are most definitely flawed, I liked the originality of the film in the 'Star Wars' franchise, and the visuals and action scenes are pretty impressive overall.",5,7,13,19 December 2016
Finding Nemo," Finding Nemo
","'Finding Nemo' is one of the crowning achievements of Pixar. It's exhilarating, genuinely funny (even for mature audiences), sweet, and, most importantly, it's got a great message. Minor Spoilers.The film starts in one of Pixars most heartbreaking openings where Marlin, a clown fish, comes back to his anemone to find his wife gone (dead, but it doesn't show her dead, obviously) and the only surviving egg of one of the hundreds of eggs that there used to be. He names him Nemo, a name his wife suggested before she died. His 'lucky' fin is a little messed up, but Marlin is determined not to lose Nemo to the point of being over protective. And, ironically, this over protectiveness is what gets Nemo taken away from Marlin. Marlin is so overprotective that Nemo ends up wanting to be away from him every chance he gets. This means that when Marlin swims all the way to catch up with Nemo's class on his first day of school, Nemo has no problem doing something very dangerous just to spite him. This results in Nemo being captured, and so Marlin's journey begins.The first thing Marlin learns is that the sea is a friendlier place than he expected. He meets Dory, an optimistic, but pretty annoying fish with short term memory loss. She begins to follow him around and they meet sharks. But the sharks don't want to hurt them. In fact, they bring them to a meeting in which they show that they are trying to stop eating fish. Of course, one of the sharks tries to eat them, but only after he smells blood. Soon enough, Marlin learns that Dory, a fish with memory loss, can read, and she even remembered what she read this time. Soon we learn that help presents itself to him in ways he wouldn't expect, and he must keep an open mind to find his son again. Thank God he has Dory to do this for him, and all of the other kind voices along the way, including a pack of fish doing impressions, a surprisingly friendly pelican, and a sea turtle named Crush, who teaches him that you must let your child figure out the world for themselves to a certain extent, and then they learn not only how to get back to their father, but why they want to. Just like Dory, for a child, their home is where their father is (or in this case, Marlin) and vice versa.In the climatic moment of the film, the main points are stressed that the characters have learned along the way. First of all, you cannot do everything alone, hence the fish all swimming downward together. Second of all, you cannot give up no matter what, even when it seems hopeless, as it has for both Nemo and Marlin many times throughout the film, hence just keep swimming. Third of all, Marlin learns to trust his son, and others along with him, and this is only reinforced in the final scene of the film in which rather than Nemo waking up Marlin, Marlin wakes up Nemo to school. He also races him to the class, and finally, Nemo swims back to Marlin to tell him he loves him, rather than Marlin swimming to catch up with Nemo's to scold him for something he almost did.",9,0,1,17 June 2016
500 Days of Summer," (500) Days of Summer
","The word 'love' is overused. We hear it virtually everyday. Whether it be in songs, movies, television, the internet, or cards, we are bludgeoned over the head by the media of the idea that we all must meet 'the one'. This results in people like Tom, a hopeless romantic and, naturally, a writer of those cards that you get every year on Valentines Day. He hopes to be an architect, but, judging by his belief in fate, he probably thinks that if he were good enough to be an architect, then he would be an architect. Summer, on the other hand, has hated the idea of 'love' ever since her parents got divorced when she was a kid. She doesn't believe in love or fate, and she doesn't want to get overly attached to anyone because she now knows how things usually end up. They meet at work, and Tom thinks he is in love with her. He lists all of the things he loves about her. Wait, before I go on I should get something straight. These two people don't fall in love with each other by the end of the movie, and the movie makes this very clear, despite seemingly looking like a stereotypical love movie based on the first scene, which shows us that life isn't like the media tells us it is. The film isn't structured in a completely linear manner, and we see that in the future, things aren't perfect between them. Anyway, Summer makes it clear that she doesn't want what they have to be serious, but this is obviously a problem with Tom, despite him not saying anything about it. There is an obvious problem with this relationship from the start that neither of them address. Summer is too close minded to open herself up to a relationship, and Tom is a hopeless romantic that believes that she is 'the one'. This results in Tom losing all hope and thinking that he will never be in love again after they break up, because she was 'the one', and it only strengthens the blow when he finds out later after running into her that Summer, the woman who never wanted a boyfriend, is now getting married. He hates her now, and the list of things that he loved about her at the beginning, is now the list of things he hates about her. When he looks back at their relationship he sees all of the bad moments. He is stuck in a rut for a little while, but his sister makes him realize that there were good times too, and he should remember all of it. He should cherish the good memories, learn from the bad ones, and move on. After Tom quit his job of making greeting cards and sulked for a while, he suddenly gets up and starts drawing on the chalkboard in the back of his room, mapping out options for an architectural job and eventually drawing a big city, filled with skyscrapers. He realized that he controls his fate, not the world. And now he is sitting on the bench that he once sat on with Summer. Suddenly he realizes Summer in the background. Tom has transformed his philosophy entirely since the beginning of the movie, saying that everything Summer used to say was right. But summer says that she now believes in love, despite being completely against the idea of it, because one day that she was with her husband she just knew that she would be with him for a long time. Something she just didn't feel with Tom. So he gets an interview for another architectural firm, after many bad ones (that we don't see). But he meets a girl in the waiting room. They talk a little, and Tom gets up to go to his interview. He suddenly turns around and asks her if she wants to go out sometime. This might seem strange and sudden, but what Summer has taught him is that some people just absolutely don't work out and won't. But sometimes, it just works, and while you shouldn't expect every girl to be the one, you might as well give it a chance, and be open minded.",8,0,0,23 June 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' has probably the most intense and exciting action scenes of any marvel movie. In fact, I feel like the movie as a whole has more in common with a 'Bourne Identity' movie than a superhero movie. This is largely do to the way these scenes were shot, edited, and choreography. The scenes are almost always shot in a wide angle, showing each full hit. While there are many cuts, I realized that again they almost never cut on a hit, which lessens the impact of the hit so it seems much less visceral. Also, again, while there are many cuts, the action is always kept in the center of the frame, so the viewer's eyes aren't jumping all over the frame every second, trying to figure out what is going on. Finally, the character always starts at a disadvantage at the beginning of a fight scene and has to fight his way back up (particularly in one of my favorite scenes, the elevator fight). I know these may seem like very subtle touches, but they add up to make some incredibly visceral fight scenes.And those are definitely the best parts of the movie. The fight scenes. Don't get me wrong, nothing else is really bad, per se. The main characters are rather well rounded (for a superhero movie that is), and they all follow similar character arcs (they all learn to be able to trust in people again, while also learning that maybe everything is not quite what it seems). There's also some political commentary, but it's very surface level stuff. Basically it tries to tell us that, while technology becomes better and better, the government will be able to develop more powerful weapons. And the government themselves could actually be apart of some Nazi party and we could be entirely oblivious as to everything they believe in and the power that they hold. Of course this sounds ridiculously over the top, and that's because it absolutely is. Hell, I even found myself laughing out loud at some of the crazier moments in the plot. So obviously it didn't exactly portray the message that I thought it was going for very well, unless it was going for satire, which I'm 99% sure it wasn't.But nonetheless, it was a very entertaining movie, with pretty good dialogue (although some obligatory cheesy superhero movie lines), well written characters, great action, and a little bit of political commentary delivered in a very over the top fashion. So I'd say it fulfilled it's purpose, and even went a bit farther than that.",6,0,2,1 April 2016
Capote," Capote
","'Capote', like it's subject, is not conventional. Rather than trying to observe Trumand Capote's entire life in one film, it observes the peak of his career and his turning point in his life, and that is the four years that he was researching and writing the first non fiction novel, 'In Cold Blood'. Yet the film seems to do justice to his entire life by subtle dialogue and showing his major development over the course of these four years. The film has a quiet, somber mood that fits perfectly with the subject, and one of Philip Seymour Hoffman's greatest performances in a career full of great performances.Truman Capote hears about a murder of the Clutters family in Kansas, and begins to do research on the subject. Buy when he finally sees one of the two murderers, Perry Smith, he seems immediately entranced by how lonely and shy Perry is, completely reversing his expectations, and as a shot in that scene shows, he feels like he is trapped in a cage away from Perry, rather than vice versa. But what Truman really sees is himself in Perry. As Truman states earlier in the film, people often feel that they know him, or have him figured out when really they have no idea who he is. And the same goes for Perry. He is a murderer, and that's all that most people will ever see in him from now on. But Truman sees something else, and wants, no, needs to understand this man. Truman places a lot of emphasis on the fact that he wants to change the way the world views Perry, and he also seems to want to change the way he is viewed. He says Perry wants so desperately to be taken seriously, but Truman is trying the be taken seriously by making this book as well. He begins meeting with him and they slowly reveal themselves to each other, Truman learning that Perry had a troubled childhood as well. Perry is very reluctant to talk about the actual murder, however. Truman begins drifting away from everyone else in his life, and there comes a point in the film 2 here it seems that the two may be using each other, but then the scene comes where Perry talks about the murders with Truman, and it's clear that the two have a connection. Ironically, the time when Perry seems the most weak and vulnerable is actually in the scene of the murders. After this, it cuts forward, and at this point Truman just wants this to be over, and frankly, he just hopes that Perry can just die so he never has to worry about him again. Perry begins trying to contact him, but Truman knows that he can't let himself get connected to Perry again, or else he may never recover. Eventually, however, just before his execution, Perry sends a heartfelt letter that brings Truman to him shortly before his execution. He witnesses the execution and kept telling himself there was nothing he could do to prevent it afterwords. But he can't escape the truth and it seems a part of him was lost forever when Perry died.The film is a not only a great character study, but one of the greatest biopics of all time, and a sad reminder that there is almost always much more to the people we think we understand.",8,1,1,29 April 2016
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange
","'Doctor Strange' explores ideas not just foreign to Marvel movie, but pretty much any mainstream movie in recent memory, besides 'Interstellar'. If it's one thing, it definitely has ambition, something desperately needed in the MCU, and it also may be the best of the marvel movies. However, the flaws may be easier to overlook, but they're there.The intro of the movie is one of its flaws. It starts with in action scene in another dimension with people we don't know yet, in a place we don't understand, with stakes that we can't understand. See the problem? It may look cool, and the action is well shot and choreographed, but there's no tension. In fact, we don't even know who to root for yet. The movie's introduction to Dr. Strange should be the real beginning of the movie, because it's pretty great. It starts with a close up of his hands. They're steady. He's precise. He's confident. He's witty. He jokes around with coworkers while dealing with a life or death situation, and he doesn't make a single mistake. This introduction is smooth and smart. We see his determination to be right, and to be in control. A fast paced conversation with Christine Palmer, another doctor, done in a single take as they are walking, tells us about his past personal life and his history with Christine, which is apparently complicated. However, while she is a side character, Christine's character is too underdeveloped.Strange is shown going extremely fast on a road with multiple people, putting their lives at risk, while also disregarding multiple people that need their lives saved because their problems aren't interesting enough. It is clear that this job isn't about helping others for him, it's about his ego. It's about being able to control everything, including death.When Strange is in a horrible accident which makes his hands shake, he tries desperately to get his job back, because without it, he is nothing. He is incapable of keeping a relationship, because he is too focused on himself. He tries every medical possibility to heal his hands, but nothing works.Benedict Cumberbatch is pretty good in this role, but some of his delivery, especially when he's angry, is kind of laughable. I know Cumberbatch is a very good actor, and it may be because of the American accent, but it just sounds melodramatic and a little corny when it should be serious. Nothing major, but it took me out of the moment a little.Through a series of events, he finds a man who recovered completely from something he thought to be impossible, and this man tells him to go to some place in India (I can't remember the name, and the name isn't important anyway). Of course, he goes there out of desperation, and is told things that make him entirely skeptical, things that make no sense to him logically. What he doesn't know is that he knows so little. What follows his skepticism is some of the most surreal, mind blowing visuals I've seen in any mainstream movie, representing the multiverse and infinite dimensions. It's pretty awesome, and actually thought provoking. While these visuals are pretty amazing in all of the mirror dimension scenes, and especially this initial revelation, one of this film's flaws is its over reliance on CGI. Don't get me wrong, most of it is pretty great, but sometimes its reach exceeds its grasp, and ends up looking just bad.Anyway, Strange begins training, and there is some very cringe worthy comedy during this time, and other than that it's mostly expository dialogue.The film picks up again when Strange begins using the Eye of Agamotto, a necklace that can control time. The real enemy is introduced and the film doesn't really let up from here. There is action set piece after action set piece, and they are all very well shot and original scenes, using the mystical, cosmic elements of the film in interesting and original ways, including a fight outside of Strange's body with another man who is outside of his body while Strange's real body is dying, but being saved by Christine. It sounds pretty complicated, but the director does a good job of making these ideas simple while watching.One major thing that bothered me while watching these scenes in the real world, however, was how incredibly calm everyone was during these incomprehensible, mind bending events they were experiencing. People would walk through a portal into Hong Kong wearing weird Indian robes, and 2 people would have any sort of reaction, which was literally just running away. Christine, while surprised, also takes it incredibly calmly when Strange's reaches out corporeal self reaches out to talk to her, despite his physical body being on a table in front of her. Also, there is logic lacking in a few action scenes. Why not create a portal directly in front of you while being chased?Regardless, what these crazy set-pieces culminate with is actually pretty powerful. It becomes about acceptance of our place in the world and acceptance of not just death, but ultimately the end of everything eventually. Even if you control time, death is one thing no one can escape. But that isn't a bad thing. Death is what gives life meaning and value. No death means no time, no time means nothing ever changes, basically living a moment over and over for eternity, which is worse than death. In order to embrace life, we must accept death.Pretty deep stuff for a Marvel movie. In fact, it's pretty deep stuff for any movie. But despite the journey Strange goes through, and his realization of his inability to control everything alone, as well as his acceptance of his, and everyone else's ultimate demise, he comes out still not fully healed, his hands still shaking, an indication that he still has much more to learn.",7,2,4,12 November 2016
Lion," Lion
","'Lion' is the touching and heartfelt true story of a five-year old Indian boy named Saroo Brierley who gets lost and far from his family, eventually being adopted by Australian parents. Twenty years after this incident, Saroo becomes determined to find his mother, brother, and sister, despite the lack of information that he has. The film is pretty much a perfectly executed feel good movie. It is a deeply human film that pretty much anyone can connect to.What really made this film so good is that it is consistently from the point of view of Saroo. It is a pretty tightly constructed film. The first scenes of the film establish the strong relationship he has with his family, and what surprised me about this movie is that the entire first half is focused on Saroo being lost as a child. The child actor performs incredibly well, and the film simply wouldn't be nearly as emotionally involving without his performance. Since the film is from his point of view, all of the big, scary things that happen to him while he is lost that he doesn't quite understand are not directly explained. One night, while Saroo is sleeping with other children in a train station, he is forced to move because men suddenly appear and begin to physically drag the children away, against their will. Saroo, of course, just runs, and their is never a mention or explanation for it, because Saroo himself doesn't understand it. As a result, the audience member is along for the same ride that Saroo is, and that allows us to feel more emotionally connected to him throughout the story.While Saroo eventually gets two loving Australian parents, he still has troubles in the form of his emotionally challenged adopted brother, and when the film cuts to 20 years later, his brother seems to have nearly disappeared from his life. Now that Saroo is 25, he is going to college, and he soon gets a girlfriend, but after being reminded of his real family and telling his story to his friends, he can't seem to shake the feeling that he needs to find his family, and that becomes his main goal. In fact, he begins to become obsessed with that goal. He has frequent and sudden flashes of memory of his town and his childhood, and this is almost all he can go from, besides the train station he ended up at after getting lost. His obsession pretty much puts all of his relationships on hiatus for years, and although he seems determined to find his real family, he completely forgets about his adopted family, and because of his reclusive behavior his mother feels as if she is losing her children. Nicole Kidman delivers a great performance as Saroo's mother and an emotional monologue describing this. Why Saroo decides not to tell his mother that he quit his job to look for his family remains a mystery to me, but perhaps it is because he didn't want to make her feel unwanted, or build up expectations and then never actually find them.What eventually happens is that those flashes of memory that Saroo has of his hometown that also gave us a deeper emotional connection for him and his family also end up leading him to his home because of recognition of a certain spot on google maps that he then traces to his house. His actual visit to his hometown after over 25 years is one of the most emotionally involving scenes of the year, considering we as the audience have been through this rough journey with him. When Saroo walks through certain spots that both the audience and Saroo recognize from his memories, we share the anticipation of the main character. That means we also share his frustration, then relief, then sadness, and ultimately his overwhelming sense of joy. The music in these scenes also adds to their emotional impact.",8,6,10,27 December 2016
Baby Driver," Baby Driver
","First, I'll address the elephant in the room: 'Baby Driver' is a pretty stupid name. But, the reason for this title is that the main character's is called Baby, and the reason for that has mainly to do with the constant music he has playing (many, many songs use the word 'baby') order to drown out the ringing in his ears (and the childhood trauma it reminds him of) due to an injury that was caused by a car crash he was in at a young age that also killed his parents, one of them also being a musical artist. Oh, also, he's a getaway driver. A really, really great one, that moves in the car with such effortless grace as if it were a dance. He started this most likely as a way of combatting the traumatic memory of his parent's car crash and assuring that he'll never make the same mistake that his parents have. He tries to make music out of the conversations he has with his boss (Kevin Spacey) and acquaintances who are all robbers (Jon Hamm, Jamie Foxx, and Eiza Gonzalez, mainly), literally taking a negative thing and trying his best to give it a positive spin. His intentions are always good, he was just pulled into this at a young age against his will and has been working to get out since.Now, it may seem like this is all spoiler territory, but most of this characterization is communicated pretty early in the film, and Baby himself rarely talks. What this film does best is communicating Baby's feelings and thoughts through the choice of music in each scene, and the choreography, editing, and camera movement that goes along with this music, often incorporating sounds happening in the scene into the beat of the song that Baby is listening to. It is like there is a constant tempo to the film, giving it a constant upbeat, heart-pounding, fast pace. Baby even often changes the music to get it so it perfectly syncs up with what is happening, as if he needed to keep a perfect rhythm to each and every move that he made. Not to mention how the action scenes themselves reveal character, rather than existing solely to be thrilling. The development happens during the action, such as one instance when Baby quickly veers off the road to prevent Batz from shooting someone. And this is on top of the fact that the action choreography and editing in these scenes is amazing, creating a perfectly symphony of gunshots and car crashes and screeching and classic rock.Even when there isn't music in the film, all of the sounds seem deliberate. Just as we hear whatever music Baby hears, we also hear the ringing in his ears when he doesn't have the music, often creating heightened tension due to a sense of imbalance compared to the easy flow the film has when there is music. There is occasionally an orchestral soundtrack when Baby doesn't have his Ipod or his record player or the radio or cassettes, but this orchestral soundtrack subtly tends to blend with the high pitched whistle that Baby actually has.From the start of the film Baby is told by one robber he worked with named Griff (Jon Beranthal) that one day he is going to have the blood on his hands and he won't be able to wash it off. Throughout the film, it constantly feels as if Baby's gleefully dancing on the rim of the volcano, almost dipping his toe in the lava on the inside. I won't spoil whether he falls in or not, as not knowing is part of the fun, but all I can say is that the ending is as satisfying as it could've possibly been subverting cleverly any expectations you may have had.",9,18,34,27 June 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring
","This film is beautiful not only because of its fantastic action scenes and special effects, but the three dimensional characters that present us with this deeply human story.The film is about how the people that persevere are not the ones with power, or even physical ability, but the ones who have the will power not to conform. This doesn't mean the heroes of this story are perfect by any means, they all have their flaws. The characters all have a sense of vulnerability, which is important for the tension in the action scenes, but it also shows that they're not perfect and not invincible. We see Frodo taking long periods of time by himself. We see how he is tortured and tempted just like the rest of them, and everyday for him is a struggle. Aragon can't escape the horrible shadow left by his father, who could've destroyed the ring when he had the chance, but decided not to. Gandalf seems wise and powerful at first, but the truth is, he doesn't know everything, and there are other evil ones that have more power than him. Sam is worried and timid. Boromir is also tempted by the ring, and it drives him to nearly kill Frodo. Alright, I could go on and on about all of the characters in the movie and what makes them unique and what drives us to care about them, but the point is, what drives them is their care for one another. It's what gives them the courage to go on and, in many scenes, it's what saves their lives. They're not invincible with each other, but without each other they wouldn't get anywhere. This is reflected in the incredibly tense action scenes, such as the one with the big orc, and the one on the staircase. This is something all of the characters learn by the end of the movie. Sam puts Frodos life above his, and gains courage from their relationship, and Frodo finally realizes that he needs Sam. Alone he would be tortured, but with Sam, it gives him hope.There is obviously much more that happens in this 3 hour long movie, but every single scene either contributes to plot or character, and the pacing is so good that the film feels like 2 hours. I wish I could get into every reason why this movie is so fantastic but that would take way too much time and too many words, so just watch the movie.",10,1,1,26 May 2016
Split," Split
","M. Night Shyamalan isn't the worst director of all time, but he's definitely been one of the most monumentally disappointing. Luckily, it seems he's come back with 'Split', a dark, fun, psychological thriller. It's not perfect by any means, but this one definitely belongs in the former part of Shyamalan's filmography.The first shot is Casey Cook sitting to the side, facing away from a group of girls her age that are taking a selfie together during a birthday party. We learn that Casey is a loner, and often acts up in class. She was forced into the party by a mercy invite, and she is forced to take a car ride with the birthday girl, Claire, and her friend, Marcia. Suddenly, they're kidnapped in a great moment that is done 'Halloween' style (although not held out for as long), with a seemingly normal shot from a good distance away from the family, before the camera slowly gets closer to them and it is revealed to be a POV shot. The shot (and the scene in general) is an example of how visually impressive the film is, mostly due to the 'It Follows' cinematographer, Mike Gioulakis. The only problem in this scene would be Casey's reaction, which is very unrealistic and could've been handled much better for sure, just like many other moments in this film. The writing for the most part is pretty good, even if there are definitely plenty of mistakes, such as one unnecessary and forced scene in which Kyle's therapist, Dr. Fletcher. The set up is that she is giving a speech over Skype, but this is just an excuse to force-feed information to us that was already obvious in the first place. There are plenty of incredibly stupid character decisions here and there, that exist solely as an attempt to make the situation more tense, even though it really just takes you out of the experience. Also, the obligatory M. Night Shyamalan cameo scene that he puts into every one of his movies does contain some cringe worthy attempts at humor, even if the rest of the humor in the film actually works. One element of the writing I can praise about this film are its characters. Casey is an empathetic character with actual depth. She seems to have a good relationship with her father, who we see teaching her to hunt and be self-reliant. At first it seems she also has a good relationship with her uncle, but in reality, she has been abused and raped by him throughout her life and forced to live with him after her father's death. Like Kevin, her uncle almost has multiple personalities, and like Kevin, she has gone through major trauma that has forced her to be completely self- reliant, and feel isolated. This story is her personal journey to becoming strong enough to truly stand up to her uncle, something she tried to do at a young age but couldn't ultimately follow through with. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance as this character is pretty great, definitely overshadowing the mediocre performance given by Haley Lu Richardson as Claire and Jessica Sula as Marcia. Kevin was a good character that was ruined by the lack of a significant arc. It is implied that his father took a train and never came back when he was young, and he was abused by his mother and bullied in school. Each prominent personality in the film actually has a psychological reason for being a part of him, because of his trauma. Hedwig is the child-like and afraid part of his mind; Patricia is his own mind's substitute for Dr. Fletcher, in other words the intellectual, calm, and therapeutic one; Barry is the cool and confident one that is taken over by Dennis, the overbearing and controlling aspect that he needed; and, finally, the Beast, a representation of his father, the dominant figure in his life that he was missing, one that he depicted as a monster and could only make up for by becoming a monster. This character and, by extension, the whole movie could've been laughably bad had the central performance of Kevin been lackluster, but luckily James McAvoy gives a great performance, with it probably being the highlight of the film. He truly transforms into 5 different characters in one body, and does each one with just as much skill as the last, flawlessly switching between each of them. The movie is incredibly dark and deranged and occasionally darkly comedic, often in quick succession. My largest complaint is definitely the ending. Shyamalan started his career with two film that have good twist endings, and for some reason thought it was a good idea to try to shoehorn one in for every film after that. I don't even know what to call the ending (or should I say endings) of this film. There was a good place this could've ended (on a shot of Casey), yet it continued to show an unnecessary moment where Kevin talks to himself for a couple seconds. Then I thought it would end there. It goes on for a little longer to show a scene in a random diner in which people are watching the news report of this event, before one horrible actor messes up her only line, and Bruce Willis makes an unnecessary last second cameo for no reason. It was really baffling.Edit: Found out the end was related to 'Unbreakable'. Haven't seen it yet, but still, why?The editing and shot selection during some scenes make them all the more intense, and the lack of jump-scares was definitely appreciated. The music was used sparingly, but it worked most of the time when it was used, save for maybe one scene in which I found the music choice off-putting. Despite all of the flaws I mentioned, the good aspects outweigh the bad ones, and this could be a return to the stories that Shyamalan does best: interesting, psychological, character driven thrillers.",6,4,15,21 January 2017
North by Northwest," North by Northwest
","'North by Northwest' is one of Hitchcock's best films, and I'd even say it is his most purely entertaining.The film starts off with a tracking shot of Roger Thornhill walking and talking quickly in a large crowd of people who all seem to be in a hurry. Right now he is simply a face in a crowd, but thanks to an identity mix up, he is soon a national criminal and has to constantly avoid not only the police, but the criminals that believe he is a government agent. And... that's pretty much the movie. But thanks to Hitchcock's direction and a constantly entertaining, tense, and surprisingly funny screenplay, this is now one of the all time classics.And it completely deserves that status. The best way to describe why it does, is to use an example from the film. So, I will use the most famous scene. First, some context. So Roger Thornhill is instructed by Eve Kendall to go to this one area in the middle of nowhere in order for him to meet this secret agent so he can figure out what is going on. There are 2 things Robert doesn't know however: this secret agent doesn't exist, and Eve is setting him up. The audience knows both these things at this point. So Roger arrives at this location and it is completely empty. We see a lone crop duster in the background, but that's about it. Suddenly, we see a car coming, and while Roger thinks, 'Will this be the man that will help me?', the audience is thinking 'Is this man going to try and kill Roger?'. A few more cars pass, each time the audience (and Roger) expects it to be the man. Finally, we see a car coming slowly from a route we haven't seen before. He comes closer and closer, until finally, he stops. Then, the door opens. A man gets out. The audience is held in this suspense for a little while. Then, finally, Roger approaches him. He begins to talk to him, and it becomes apparent that this is not the man. They both start talking and begin to notice the crop duster. The man then points out that the plane is not crop dusting where there are crops. Suddenly, the audience realizes, what is about to happen. The man gets in the bus, the bus drives away, and the plane begins to fly directly at Roger.This scene continues, and it's the best and most suspenseful scene in the whole film, but many other scenes in the film aren't far behind. And that is saying something. The situation that Roger gets into, where no one is on his side and he constantly has to think on his feet, means that there is constant tension and threat in this film. And the fact that each scene in this film (that one in particular) is shot, edited, and blocked to perfection, means that this film contains some of the most suspenseful moments in any Hitchcock film, scratch that, any film in general.",9,1,3,3 April 2016
Being John Malkovich," Being John Malkovich
","Since every human being is constantly tethered to their bodies and their perception of the world through that body, the curiosity of what life is like from another person's perspective is intrinsic to human nature. So what if the person whose body you could inhabit was critically acclaimed actor John Malkovich? And what if the portal to his mind was in an office with a low ceiling because it was in between two floors of a skyscraper? 'Being John Malkovich' answers both of these questions and many more with a surprising amount of insight and depth.Craig Schwartz is a struggling puppeteer performing on the streets of New York to an audience who doesn't want him. He has a wife, Lotte, but they are clearly somewhat distant from each other, and she is often at work or trying to convince him to get a job. Finally, he obliges when money runs low, and he ends up filing cabinets at the odd floor 7 1/2. It's telling that his boss thinks that he has a speech impediment because his assistant has trouble hearing and often misinterprets his words: the only window into how he is perceived by others is filtered through the imperfect perceptions of those around him. In this office he sees Maxine Lund and slowly becomes desperate for her, even acting out a romantic encounter with her with his puppets while proclaiming it's the chance to feel what someone else feels that draws him to puppeteering. Soon after he stumbles upon a window into a man's brain, and while John Malkovich may have seemed like a random choice by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, I don't think it's an accident that the man they begin to live through is an actor himself, constantly trying to immerse himself in many different roles and different lives. As Craig and Lotte soon find out, completely changing their role and appearance in life helps them to further discover who they are and what they want. By discovering that her true self is not the gender or appearance or age that their assigned, Lotte realizes she feels more comfortable as a man. Of course, they do begin to exploit this sudden discovery as most human beings would do. Maxine does it for control, and Craig does it for Maxine's adoration, but it is only a matter of time until Malkovich himself finds this portal.Malkovich inevitably entering this portal himself could've been handled in a plethora of ways, but how it is handled is brilliant, funny, thought provoking, and it deepens the themes of the film. It shows how our mind ultimately compares everyone around us to ourselves because it is all that we have to compare to, and it also shows how many different versions of oneself exist within one's own mind, each revealing themselves at different times. And this isn't even the last big surprise of the movie. The climax exists entirely in Malkovich's subconscious. Although even through all of the film's heady ideas and absurdism it remains a very fundamentally human film. As Craig gets a hold of controlling Malkovich, they toy with the idea that one's position in life and preexisting image often dictates their success, but the surprisingly tragic ending reveals that what is at the core of who Craig is, regardless of the body he inhabits, is who he desires, and this is ultimately what dictates his actions, and it isn't hard to see that this desire is what dictates every other character as well, especially when the person one desires is just out of reach.",9,2,3,26 June 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War
","With the excess of superhero movies coming out these days, I wish they were all as complex and thought provoking as this one. When I say this is the best superhero movies since 'The Dark Knight' I mean that, and it's undoubtedly the best of the Marvel movies. This is because of genuinely interesting, believable, and flawed characters that all have understandable motives. Now if you're like me and, during climactic superhero scenes like the one in the avengers, always wonder 'What about the people in those buildings the 'heroes' are smashing up? Aren't they killing thousands of people right now?', then you will love this movie from the get go. Because in this film, the heroes begin to start facing the consequences of the actions, and start to feel genuine guilt for what they've done, besides Captain America, who seems to believe that he needed to sacrifice these people for the greater good of others. Seriously, while in almost all superhero movies there is a clear good guy and bad guy, in this one I genuinely couldn't decide who was good or bad. Even the man who at first seems like the stereotypical bad guy is revealed to have much more behind him. He will make you realize that that some of our so called 'heroes' aren't much better than what seems at first to be a stereotypical villain. The morality is grayer than most action movies of the past 20 years.Its not only got great writing, but its got the great action we've seen in the last Captain America film, but cranked up to 11. There are many great action scenes in this film, but the ones that stick out the most are the car chase scene, and of course, the big fight between Captain America and his gang, and Iron Man and his gang. The latter is a fantastic scene, all of the superheros using there specific powers against each other, while occasionally another would chime in to help someone else out in a fight, and so on and so on. But it's handled with such grace that it never becomes excessive or confusing. All of the camera movements and cuts make it easy to understand what is happening while also handling all this action and all of these superheros at once, going from one battle to the next, and yet they still find time to put genuinely hilarious moments in all of this. It's incredibly impressive, and these great action scenes are already on top of the great writing. Possibly the only part of the film that I felt was unnecessary was the romance between Steve Rogers and Kate, and that is a minor complaint considering how little that portion of the movie is.It's an ensemble character driven film like 'Boogie Nights', mixed with the usual humor of a marvel movie with action from 'The Bourne Supremacy' but with superheros, but also with the moral complexity of 'The Dark Knight' (although just not really as good as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Boogie Nights'). And if that's not a recommendation, then I don't know what is.",7,8,18,6 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," The. Conjuring 2
","There is a series of scenes in 'The Conjuring 2' that left me holding my breath at many moments, and these scenes in the first half of the film are honestly very scary. This makes it all the more upsetting when suddenly it turns into a corny supernatural thriller towards the end, with an incredibly cheesy and contrived scene involving the characters sitting in the back of an ambulance after the climax (does anyone else feel like this type of scene has become a trope?).The early scenes of the film do a good job recreating not just the look of the time and place, but the zeitgeist of it. We get to know this family, who is basically just a normal working class family, with a single mother.The scariest moments in the film begin with Janet suddenly waking up on the floor. Downstairs. She walks back upstairs, and then begins to talk to herself in two completely different voices. Suddenly, Margaret hears from behind her 'This is my house' in a deep, scratchy voice. She turns around. There is no one. This is the genius of the scenes things happen, but then there's nothing every time, and the viewer is just waiting for the moment when things go really wrong, but it's not coming. This is suspense, and this is horror. Another great moment is when Billy walks downstairs to get water. When he is walking back up, you can subtly see someone sitting in the leather chair to his right in the other room, but it's just a silhouette. Now the viewer is really on edge. He goes upstairs and suddenly his toy firetruck goes off. He turns it off and pushes it back into the tent. When he walks over to his bed, we hear the toy go off and roll out of the tent once again, and Billy freezes. He leans back and we think he is about to go turn it off and in our minds we think 'no don't do it!' Then he starts to get back into his bed, then once again he leans back and the camera follows him, and we think 'No!' Then he goes into his bed all the way. But the camera stays looking out into the hallway for just enough time to be completely on edge and aware that something is about to happen. Then the kid comes back into frame, but when he goes back into his bed this time, the camera moves with him. We are relieved for a second, then suddenly we hear the firetruck roll into the room. He turns it off, walks back over to his tent, rolls it into the tent, then it is rolled right back out, facing the opposite direction, and when the boy grabs it, we immediately hear a loud scream from a grown man. This is one of the two very effective jump-scares in the film (the second being the 'MY HOUSE' jumpscare, with the old man and the remote control), because of how long it takes to build up its tension, and then how unexpectedly it hits you. There was no face popping out, just a scream. It earns the jumpscare with the tension.All of this great tension building is thrown out of the window in the second half of the film however, in favor of a corny supernatural thriller with a message of 'help others, especially when no one else will'. There is nothing wrong with the message, but the way it is integrated into the film does not mesh very well with any sort of serious horror, and the whole film becomes very over the top and silly. There is a single moment I can think of where I genuinely felt for one of the characters, and this was when Maurice was talking about his dead daughter.Even the all of the entities in the house become not at all scary, because we are shown so much of them for so long, that we get used to it. Also, the crooked man just looks silly in general, he looks like a tall stop motion animated figure, and the way he moves is almost cartoony. The jump-scares become much more predictable, and there is only a single moment I can remember that had me genuinely tense.This moment was short, but it was when Ed was reaching down into the water to find something, just after Peggy had been bitten under water. There's already tension that he will also be bitten, but at the edge of the frame as the camera is zooming in on Ed, there is a head only slightly above water. This seriously put me on edge, and then there was no jump-scare, so it forced me to stay pretty tense. This was a smart moment because of its subtlety, and subtlety, many don't realize, is the key to horror. Seeing doors slam and things fly across the room isn't scary, in fact it gets boring pretty quickly. Seeing a silhouette figure near the edge of the frame, that the characters don't notice, but you know is right there, THAT'S scary.",6,1,2,18 September 2016
Jackie," Jackie
","'Jackie' is a nuanced portrayal of Jackie Kennedy in the days surrounding JFK's assassination. We see her calm composure in the days before and her struggle to maintain this in the days after. It dies show the assassination itself, but each time it shows a little bit more, and each time it's a bit more intense and disturbing. The film is done entirely from the perspective of Jackie herself, and the film jumps around through time in such a way as if we are looking into her mind ourselves. The cinematography shows this through constantly being intimately close to Jackie's face. Considering this is a film driven by the central character of Jackie Kennedy (and her alone), this film required a great central performance, and Natalie Portman gives one. It goes further than the fact that she talked with the same voice as Jackie Kennedy. Perhaps the most visceral and emotionally resonant part of the film, was her performance. Even in this horrible, terrifying situation, Natalie Portman never resorts to overacting. The soundtrack is fantastic and conveys a sense of dread throughout the film.Through her political dealings, her first interview after the assassination, and, most of all, several meetings with a Priest, we learn much about this important historical figure. Jackie Kennedy is humanized through this film. We learn about her conflicts during the aftermath of the assassination, and despite constantly depicting herself as strong and resilient to the public, we see that she was absolutely confused, lonely, and terrified underneath. She clearly loved her husband and wanted badly to honor him, but she also romanticized him to the point where he was no longer a real human in her mind, but instead a perfect legend. It is insinuated several times that she didn't have a perfect relationship with her husband. Her children were all that she had left and she wanted to protect them, but she mentions she wants to be assassinated like her husband, not just for the fame, but just to be with him. It seems she felt that she lost potential with JFK, and I think that's why she tried so hard to make sure she and her husband went down in history. More than anything, it seems Jackie just felt lonely.This film is a bit cluttered in its narrative structure, but since this is primarily a character study, I didn't mind. The film isn't about the historical figure, but the human being behind that facade. The film is simply an intimate and personal portrayal of a conflicted woman in horrible circumstances.",7,2,5,25 December 2016
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Assassination of Jesse James by the 'Coward' Robert Ford
","'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' should hold no surprises. I mean, the end of the movie is spoiled for you in the title... right? Well, if that's what you thought then you would be dead wrong, because this film is thought- provoking, sad, beautiful, and thoroughly tense from beginning to end, even though there is not much shooting in this long film.Robert Ford has grown up reading books and hearing stories about the courageous Robert Ford and has grown incredibly obsessed with him, even though he has never met him. When Rob goes with his brother Charlie to finally meet Jesse, he is understandably excited. However, as we, and Rob, come to find out, Jesse is only a human, like the rest of us. And he is not exactly the courageous outlaw he has heard about. Jesse is temperamental, depressed, and even sadistic, and he feels pain just like the rest of us. He is a man that hates himself even though everyone else idolizes him. Robert himself is not perfect either. He is insecure, young, and unbelievably obsessed with Jesse James, to the point where he wants to be him. In fact, the connections Robert tries to make with him about the facts of both their lives are so arbitrary that it's genuinely unsettling. Robert assassinates Jesse for many reasons (in possibly the best scene in the film), one unspoken one being that Jesse actually wants to be killed, but after the assassination, Robert finds himself hoping for glory for what he's done. He even makes a play about the assassination, starring him and his brother, to glorify it. However, what he gets is far from glory. As Jesse's body is toured around the U.S.A., Robert begins to be chastised as a coward, and Robert is more alone, angry, and confused in his whole life than he has ever been.This whole film wouldn't work without the fantastic performances from everyone in the cast (especially Brad Pitt, in his best role yet) and by the fantastic direction that combine to make even a simple conversation incredibly tense. Also, the beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins makes this something special, showing the wild west in a more dark and gloomy manner than we're used to. It also highlights the way we view history, with the edges of the frame blurred, through a rather subjective point of view.On top of all of that, this film is important because it exposes how our society views famous people. We don't exactly view them as people. We idolize them and strive to be like them, when truthfully we don't know the first thing about them or who they are. We label Jesse James as a courageous man and Robert Ford as a coward, when really both are just humans. Jesse James may seem like a good man but he has genuine flaws likethe rest of us, and Robert Ford may seem like a coward, but he has good qualities that we never even bother to try and see. Even though Robert makes a reenactment of the assassination on Broadway and thousands of people see it, we could never put ourselves into the actual situation. We could get together and put a man to death without the man ever being given a chance to be understood. We may tell ourselves that he is a 'coward', but what we don't realize is that 'Robert Ford could only lay on the floor and look at the ceiling. The light going out of his eyes, before he could find the right words.'",10,1,1,15 March 2016
Saving Private Ryan," Saving private Ryan
","You could watch the first scene of this film and think: 'this is a great scene, but why is this necessary?' But really, this scene lays out the foundation for the rest of the film. The scene shows how fragile life is in war. How a man could die right next to you within a matter of seconds and you may not even notice. It also shows how all hope seems to be crushed by war, showing a man nearly being hit by a bullet and checking his helmet, but only getting shot in the head seconds later. It also shows men trying to revive a man on the ground, and just as they stop the bleeding, the man is shot in the head. The film shows this later in a scene involving Vin Deasel attempting to save a child from a building in the middle of a war zone, only to be shot by a sniper and have that child go back to his parents. It shows how there are no clear good guys and bad guys and how the Americans aren't necessarily any better than the other guys by showing men killing unarmed troops from the other side for, well, no reason. It shows this later in a scene in which the once naive Timothy is spared by a German soldier, and then kills an unarmed soldier who he spared earlier in the film only to have him be put back into circulation and kill more men, showing also how drastically it changes men. It even shows how Captain Miller must find hope in the face of all the horrible things happening around him by muting all the sound and using slow motion, both techniques that are used in a similar situation towards the end of the film as a call back. After this fantastic scene, however, the men of Captain Miller's squad are called on a mission to save the final son of a mother who has lost her three other sons to this war only recently. The men are obviously confused by why they would need to risk all of their lives to save one man, and the film teeters back and forth on whether this mission is worth it or not. At many points it seems futile, especially after a second soldier is killed off in an incredibly heart wrenching scene in which Miller asks the dying medic what they can do to help him to which he responds with simply 'some morphine would help'. But in many places they seem to find possible hope. A high ranking officer tells Miller 'I have a brother. You get that boy home'. And when they accidentally find the wrong Private Ryan and inform him that his brothers are dead, even after he is told that he is not the guy the were looking for, just the idea of his brothers being dead tears him apart, showing the importance of a single person. Then also when they are loudly searching through dog tags to find a Private Ryan, only to realize that a squadron full of people that fought with those men are walking by. This shows that to them what is a meaningless name could have incredible significance to others. When they do end up getting to Ryan, it turns out he doesn't want to be saved. If he dies he says to tell his mom that he died with the only brothers that he had left. But Miller decides that if they save Private Ryan it might be the only decent thing that they've done in this horrible situation, and then they could truly earn their right to go home. But the victory is a long shot, and many people die in the process, including Miller. But Private Ryan survives, and in Miller's dying breaths he tells Ryan to 'earn this'. Ryan ends up living the rest of his life trying to live up to Captain Miller's command and earn this opportunity to live that many died to give him. So, was it even worth it?Well, its not black and white, but the film argues yes, to some extent. Many men may have died, and many may have been permanently damaged, both emotionally and physically. And they may not know the good that they have done for the world, but as Private Ryan talks to Miller's grave in his old age, his wife and kids and grand kids lurk behind him, showing that if it weren't for people like Miller, many people today wouldn't exist. For every one man that is saved, many more get the chance to live.",10,1,4,29 May 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
","'The Two Towers' has just the same amount of heart as 'Fellowship', but on a much bigger scale. In this film, the fellowship from the first film is now split up into small groups of two or three, but in a way they are closer than ever. The last film showed how the characters care for each other inspired courage in them, and how without each other they were nothing. This film shows this on a bigger scale, not just uniting the characters even closer, but the races of humans, elves, and ents, showing that in the end they are all fighting for the same cause, for some good in the world. This film introduces one of the most tortured and iconic characters of the series, Golemn... or, Smeagle. At first glance he seems like a monster, but really he is just torn into 2 halves, one loyal and scared, the other dominating and deceitful, and everyday is a struggle fir him. Sam dislikes him and distrusts him, but no one understands his struggle more than Frodo. Frodo has seen it almost happen to Bilbo, and its happening to him. The ring is beginning to overtake him. Frodo needs to know that Smeagle/Golem can get better, because then he can believe that there is still hope for him that he can go back to the way he was. There is a large war in this film with great action, but the action also highlights the way in which the characters have developed. They work with each and help each other not to survive, but because they care for each other, and they know that they must unite against the bad that there is in the world. There are great character moments such as the moment where Gimli asks Aragorn to throw him, showing his trust for him while in the previous movie he states, 'No one throws a dwarf'.Mary and Pippin are almost killed, but they run into a forest and are taken away by ents, who turn out to be rather friendly. But when they meet to discuss what they should do about this war that is happening, they choose not to intervene. Mary is upset because he knows the long term effect of what will happen if the orcs win the war ('There will be no shire'). But when the ent sees fields of his fallen friends, he knows that he must fight with those that are still alive with him, because you can use apathy to hide from the dangers of the world as much as you'd like, but eventually they will catch up with you, so the only thing you can do is fight for what you have left. At many times it seems there is no hope for the characters, specifically Aragorn and Frodo, but Aragorn continues on because he knows that Arwen will be waiting for him on the other side. Frodo continues because, as we find out through an incredibly heartfelt speech by Sam, they believe that there is still good in the world, and it's worth fighting for. That is just one line from his fantastic speech, but it embodies what I love about the Lord of the Rings movies. There may be hobbits and elves and orcs and magic and dwarfs and wizards and even talking trees, but it is a deeply human story. Just like our world, there is also lots of hate and temptation and evil, but eventually it all passes, because we have people like Frodo and Sam, who are not super heroes, but normal human beings who are scared and absolutely need each other to regain courageous, but they know that there is good in the world that is worth fighting for.",10,0,1,27 May 2016
The Elephant Man," The Elephant Man
","David Lynch is known for his surreal, complex films, but this simple, heart wrenching story about the resilience of the human spirit is his most beautiful and yet grueling film simultaneously. And I know that to most people, greuling would seem like the better word to describe this movie than beautiful, judging by its harsh black and white aesthetic and it's utterly depressing main story, but like it's subject, there is so much more underneath it's exterior. It actually has fantastic, truly uplifting moments on par with the Shawshank Redemption and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest that literally had me in tears occasionally, and for me that really isn't common. This is due in no small part to the incredible performance by both John Hurt as John Merrick, who portrays surprisingly more happiness than pain underneath the layers of Merrick's physical suffering, and Anthony Hopkins subtly caring performance as Fred Treves, Merrick's friend.It is about Joseph Merrick, or as many know him, 'the elephant man'. He has been looked on as a creature or a beast his entire life, being paraded a around in a freakshow owned by a man that abuses him. But when Fred Treves, a doctor, finds him in a freakshow he takes him into the London hospital. He doesn't talk for a long time, leading Treves to believe he is just stupid, and hope to God that he is stupid, because if he isn't then that would mean his he has had bottle up his intelligence and true self for his entire life. But this only makes it all the more depressing when later Treves discovers his true personality just before they were about to kick him out. He ends up staying, and we learn that his whole life, all he has really wanted was to be normal, be loved, and know his mother. This is where 'The Elephant Man' challenges us as viewer's to see beyond the exterior of the people we stare at on the street, because there is so much more beyond that, and all they really want is to be normal, even though they seem cursed from birth not to. It encourages us to try and understand the unfamiliar instead of dismiss it, because to be loved and to be normal isn't just what Joseph Merrick wants, it's what we all want.",10,0,0,14 May 2016
Dog Day Afternoon," Dog Day Afternoon
","After text assuring you that this is in fact 'based on a true story', the opening montage of 'Dog Day Afternoon', comprised of footage of real Brooklyn inhabitants and locations, displays exactly what the title describes: a regular, hot summer day as everyone goes about their daily routine. Elton John's 'Amoreena' is the only song that plays during the entire film, and it is played over this montage of Brooklyn to set a casual tone that is upset by the sudden enacting of a bank robbery. At first it is startling as Sal pulls his gun out on the manager of the bank and Sonny frantically lines everyone up on the wall, threatening them with his rifle, but soon enough it isn't hard to tell he didn't plan much out, as one of the members of his gang of three quickly runs off afraid, leaving just Sonny and Sal. Then, mostly through his own ineptitude, Sonny accidentally attracts the attention of a man across the street and soon enough the police are surrounding the bank, along with a crowd of bored bystanders that watch the event as if it were entertainment meant for them.Soon the media gets a hold of this story and people begin treating Sonny like a celebrity and everything he says is given more importance, with people either viewing him as a people's champion or an evil villain, shifting their perception of him to fit their view of the world, idolizing him even when he doesn't want it. But by bringing us inside the bank, this film allows us to see Sonny and Sal as the scared, desperate, genuine human beings they were. We learn that despite the extreme measures these people are ultimately trying to help who they think needs it, even insinuating both Sal and Sonny may be suffering from their experience in the war. That doesn't make them good people, but the fact that their robbing a bank also doesn't make them bad people, and it is so much easier to sympathize with Sonny due to Al Pacino's fantastic performance, showcasing all of Sonny's fear, doubt, anxiety, and hope during this ordeal. John Cazale brings a surprising amount of deadpan humor to Sal while never feeling like it is betraying the realism of the film. For that matter, all of the performances in this film pull you deeper into it, to the point where you can almost forget your watching a movie and not the real people involved in this event.Despite taking place almost entirely in one location, the film is far more visually interesting than many films that I have seen that take place in a plethora of places. Lumet rarely resorts to the standard and boring shot/reverse shot when shooting conversations, often keeping the camera mobile (even if its subtle movement), blocking the scenes to show the relationship between characters at that moment, and occasionally having multiple stories being told on screen at once.Yet, although the film never feels overtly cinematic, in the end I began to root for Sonny and Sal, and began to build expectations based on my sympathy for this character, but, just like those who saw him on their television at home, we forgot that this was a true story and not happening as a fantasy, and once he leaves the cameras, the reality of the situation hits him and us rather suddenly.",10,1,2,1 August 2017
Event Horizon," Event Horizon
","'Event Horizon' was apparently pitched as 'The Shining' in space, and maybe that would've been a good movie, but that is not the one I watched. The film begins and it's other obvious influence of 'Alien' (and 'Aliens' for that matter) also shows, only these people don't feel like real, working class people like the ones in 'Alien', they feel like movie characters, and this continues throughout the film. They pause during dramatic moments, they are sometimes seemingly unfazed by the chaos around them. The choppy editing, pointless Dutch camera angles and crash zooms, and the constant, clich√© score take a lot of the tension out of the film, and each jumpscare is incredibly predictable and ineffective. Unlike its supposed influences, it does not create a sense of tension and dread through silence, but rather only uses silence for a few seconds before each jumpscare. Not to mention the incredibly cheesy special effects that attempted to use CGI, and failed horribly, looking far worse than 'Alien', 'The Thing', 'The Shining', and it's many other much older influences.Paul W.S. Anderson wanted so badly for this to be like the movies he loved, but forgot entirely what made them so great.",3,3,6,20 October 2016
Silence," Silence
","'Silence' is not going to be a movie for everyone. Coming off his last commercial and critical hit 'The Wolf of Wall Street', Scorsese now brings us a completely different type of film: two Jesuit missionaries go to Japan, where Christianity is outlawed, in order to find a priest that has gone missing. In a pretty varied career overall, with films ranging from 'Taxi Driver' to 'Goodfellas' to 'The Departed' to 'Shutter Island' to 'Hugo' to 'The Wolf of Wall Street', 'Silence' stands out as one that is completely unlike anything else Scorsese has made. This is apparently a passion project by Scorsese, and it shows. While the film got generally positive reviews, it seems to be one of the more divisive of Scorsese's career and I don't expect it to be a commercial hit. It is long, slow, hard to watch, and it isn't a typically entertaining film, but it is incredibly well made and thought provoking about the concepts of religion and faith.The film begins with the brutal torture of several Christians in Japan by seething hot water being dripped onto them slowly, and reveals that what we are seeing is a description from a letter which is being read by a Jesuit priest to two missionaries. It seems they have been seeking word from the author of this letter, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), for some time, and the priest is telling them that it is time to give up, since they have gotten word from the messenger of this letter that Ferreira has abandoned Christianity and joined the Japanese. They simply can't believe this, and they are determined to find out for themselves.I don't know if I was just tired or if this was the fault of the movie, but from about 20 minutes into the film until probably the end of the first hour, more or less, I found myself dozing off during multiple scenes. Luckily, the slow moving and generally uneventful, but well directed first hour does end, and the small developments made in that time frame do ultimately pay off for the rest of the film, which I found much more engaging and thought provoking. The film begins to ask questions about faith and religion that don't necessarily have clear answers. When does being a good Christian collide with being a good person? Which is really more important? Is there even a God? Is he even worth fighting for? What makes one religion more important than another? Which is more important: your intent or your action? Can you be a good Christian even if you never act upon it or show it outwardly? How do you find peace and redemption? Can you change the nature of a human being? All of these difficult and taboo questions (and more) are handled with grace by Scorsese, and he never truly provides an answer for any of them, but just continues to ask them in a number of different ways. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the film is constantly visually interesting in the camera's movement and the blocking and composition, even when confined to only a few locations for a large amount of the run-time. It is powerfully acted by Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, and especially Andrew Garfield, who is a serious contender for best actor this year. Each actor fully committed to their role, losing a lot of weight in order to add to the realism of their character. The film doesn't promote Christianity, but it also doesn't condemn it. While the film insinuates that Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sees or speaks with God on multiple occasions, it is never clear whether this is real, or formed out of Rodrigues' desperation, and almost every time he encounters God something horrible happens immediately after, making both the audience and Rodrigues question whether God is really there.In the dumpster fire that is known as religious movies, there are few shining gems. Those few gems include 'Breaking the Waves', 'Black Narcissus', 'The Passion of Joan of Arc', 'The Gospel According to St. Matthew', 'Winter Light', and, while I have yet to see it, Scorsese's own 'The Last Temptation of Christ' is loved by many. 'Silence' is possibly my favorite of this bunch, and I have a feeling I'll like it even more the next time I watch it.",9,4,9,6 January 2017
Logan," Logan
","'Logan' is the answer to all of my Marvel movie prayers. Let me start by listing my problems with the other comic book films: firstly the lack of real stakes or sense of vulnerability for the characters. While the stakes are almost cartoonishly high in other Marvel movies, considering they are literally saving the world, what they fail to do is truly make us feel as if the main characters could be killed at all. Whenever anything bad happens to these characters, they seem to immediately bounce back, such as with Nick Fury, who was shot multiple times and came back later in the movie, and James Rhode, who fell from the sky, yet is now recovering. In 'Logan', they aren't messing around. Not only are characters beat up, bruised, guilt-filled, and slowly deteriorating, but many important characters are killed, usually at the most unexpected moments. The gore is also realistic and often genuinely disturbing. Secondly, the visuals. I'm not saying that most Marvel movies have bad special effects, and I'm not even saying that the cinematography is bad, per se, it's just so... bland. The color palette is dull, and most everything (besides for some action scenes) is shot in the most boring and predictable way, with no real distinct visual style. In 'Logan', the cinematography has a very dusty and rugged feel to it. Also, the scenes in which Professor X has his fits after not taking his medicine, in which he essentially freezes everyone, not allowing them to move, genuinely feel tense and uncomfortable due to their shaky and claustrophobic camera- work, and you can feel Logan's struggle to move. Finally, the music. Again, nothing really very wrong with the music in other Marvel films, just nothing that ever stands out as unique or interesting. Music isn't often used in this film, but when it is, it heightens the emotion of each scene, whether it be heartfelt and genuine or intense.On top of this, it has the best action scenes in any Marvel movie, with fantastic choreography and cinematography that doesn't rely at all on shaky cam or over editing, but rather clear, energetic, and hard hitting camera-work. The depiction of the future in the film is also subtly delivered through visuals that are relevant to the themes of government and upper class exploitation of minorities and others who can easily be taken advantage of for the most benefit. For instance, self driving cargo trucks are shown at one part nearly hitting people that are trying to get their horses off of the road, and large crop-harvesting machines are shown in the background of a poor man's farm. And, of course, the characters. Logan is a lonely alcoholic who is hiding on the border with Caribana, a mutant whose skin burns in the sun and who once helped to round up the original mutants, and with Professor X, who now requires medication in order to not accidentally kill himself and those around him. These are the only two people he still cares about after the death of all of the other mutants. He is working as a limo driver and saving up to buy a boat so he can sail away into the ocean with these two people and stop having to worry about being hunted by the government. The opening scene tells us that this is a man who has killed many and doesn't want to kill anymore, but is too often forced into situations where he has to. He has profound guilt for his murder, regardless of whether the people he killed were 'bad' or 'good'. Logan is almost without hope, unlike Charles Xavier, who seems to believe there are still other mutants. To Logan's surprise, there is a young mutant girl named Laura who has just escaped a government facility where they have been attempting to modify and condition her to be an unempathetic killing machine for her entire life. A nurse approaches Logan with help, and while he is very reluctant because of the danger that will come with protecting this girl, he is eventually forced into it, and his empathy and conscience take over. 'Logan' is a dark, dark movie. The light at the end of the tunnel seems to shrink more and more throughout the movie, but what is important is that it always exists, despite the terrible ordeals these characters go through. After all is said and done, there is still a small ray of light peering into the blackness of their reality, and that is what these characters seem to constantly be chasing.",8,2,6,3 March 2017
La La Land," La La Land
","With its extravagant, fantastically choreographed opening scene, all done in a single long take, 'La La Land' shows that it is inspired by the great classic musicals from the golden age of Hollywood, yet I can say with certainty that this surpasses all of those.Last year, the most technically impressive films of the year were 'The Revenant' and 'Mad Max: Fury Road', two intense action films. This year, it's 'La La Land', a romantic musical. The cinematography, set design, costume design, and choreography of the film are all pretty much flawless. Almost every dance scene is done in one perfect long take, as the camera flows naturally with the characters' dance, and when they are cuts, it is edited flawlessly, and each moment transitions into the next perfectly. The cinematography and editing are fast paced and energetic when they need to be, but also slow and elegant when necessary. The film is incredibly ambitious, which fits, considering it's about having dreams and ambitions, and just going for them.On top of its technical brilliance, the film has fantastic writing and characters, and just as the set design and choreography and cinematography and lighting and lyrics of each musical number perfectly align, the musical numbers flow perfectly with the story. The musical numbers are reflections of the characters' romanticism of each other and the world around them, and as they slowly lose their romanticism, the dance numbers begin to happen less. Even outside of the musical numbers, the cinematography, lighting, and colors of each scene match the feelings of the characters. Vibrant reds, blues, greens, and yellows show up often to depict the joy and happiness of the characters while more dull and standard lighting shows their displeasure with their life at the moment. There is also one fantastic montage in which the cinematography depicts how both characters, while still in a relationship, now feel distant and lonely due to complications with their jobs. The film is also incredibly comedic at times (mostly towards the beginning), and the performances by the main two leads are very charismatic and passionate, and it allowed me to easily connect with these two characters.Damien Chazelle has proved himself to be among the greatest and most original directors working today. In 2014, he did his first film, 'Whiplash' and it blew me away. Now he has done his second film, and it is completely different in tone, genre, and style, yet is executed just as perfectly.",10,5,11,21 December 2016
Saw," Saw
","'Saw' is a smart, tense, psychological horror/thriller that nowadays, thanks to its awful sequels and the many imitators it spawned, is passed off as a cheap torture porn.The first scene is an intriguing setup: A man wakes up in a grimy, dark bathroom, in the bath. He gets out and hears a deep voice speaking to him. The lights come on, it turns out someone else is in the room and he also has no idea what is happening. Also, there's a dead body in the center of the room. The mysteries unravel one by one mostly through a series of flashbacks. While this constant switching between time and place may seem like a jarring structure, the transitions between these scenes are handled very well by James Wan, the director. The cutting back and forth actually aids the film, since it leaves constant mystery and suspense throughout the entire film. Literally, the entire film.The suspense and mystery of the film is mostly character based. Everyone in the film has a reason for where they are. These are not the usual clich√É¬© horror film archetypes. First, the two men who are trapped together. Adam is a private eye who basically exposes people for money, and he's impatient and easily angered. Lawrence Gordon is a doctor, who cheats on his wife, but he isn't an entirely terrible person. He does love his daughter and it seems he wants to change. Then there's David Tapp, who becomes incredibly obsessed with this case, to the point of rushing into Jigsaw's hideout without a warrant and with his partner, Detective Sing, who is killed by Jigsaw, the murderer, during their ambush. Tapp then only falls more into obsession, driven by his guilt from the death of his partner. Then, of course, there is Jigsaw, who has severe cancer and is fed up seeing others who don't appreciate their lives, so he creates these elaborate torture scenarios which will make the victim appreciate their lives more if they escape. Of course, all of this is revealed slowly throughout the film, but that doesn't mean it was slow paced. There is constantly a new mystery to focus on in this film.The cinematography has a gritty, grimy feel to it constantly that fits the depravity of the characters well. The quick editing increases the tension of many situations, such as when the detectives go into the abandoned mannequin factory to find Jigsaw, which is also a notable scene for incorporating the extent of Tapp's obsession into the moment when he decides to 'see what Jigsaw does' rather than attempt to save the man who is about to be killed. Even in this intense moment, the film is able to develop the character. There are many other genuinely frightening sequences, such as when Adam goes looking for the man in his dark house with nothing but a camera flash, as well as the moment where Lawrence is kidnapped and the moments leading up to it. James Wan knows that in order for a moment to be truly scary, you must hint that there's something there, but not specify what. The fear of the unknown is infinitely scary than all the blood and guts you can imagine. Speaking of which, the film is actually much less gory than people make it out to be, and when there is gore, and don't get me wrong, there is some gruesome imagery, but it is not overdone to the point where it becomes ineffective. It will shock you every time because it is never shown in detail for more than a few seconds.A very good horror/thriller that, judging by the end of this one, received many unjustified sequels.",7,1,4,8 October 2016
Don't Breathe," Don't Breathe
","VERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD 'Don't Breathe' is not only a description of what the characters were doing in the film, but what I was doing for pretty much the entirety of it.The set up of the film is a perfect recipe for tension. Three kids in Detroit want to rob a rich blind veteran's house so they can leave Detroit for various reasons. One of the kids, Alex, robs because he doesn't want to be alone, since his father is often absent. He wants to be with Rocky, who is pretty much his only friend it seems. Also, his father is a cop, so it allows him to help out with the legal side of things to make sure they have minimal consequences if they are caught. Money robs because it's all he can do, and he seems to enjoy it. Rocky robs so that she can get enough money to leave her abusive mother and bring her little sister with her to California. They plan to rob a rich blind veteran, expecting it to be easy money that could finally allow them to leave Detroit. Except, in a clever twist on the home invasion genre, the robbers get trapped in with this psychopathic man who attempts to murder these kids by using only 4 of his 5 senses, and his dog.Almost the whole film takes place in the man's small house, and the film feels very claustrophobic, using many extreme close ups and smart sound design to sustain tension. The tension in the film is mostly set up through an impressive long take which follows the characters as they silently traverse the house, checking every room silently, and establishing a sense of location, while also being a very intense scene in itself which culminates with a very tense final image. From here, the film doesn't let up, and trust me when I say that. The editing gets faster and faster, the encounters get closer, and the film could surprise you in ways you wouldn't expect. Let's just say that there's serious vulnerability of the characters in the film, and it makes each scene become more and more tense when you truly believe the characters could die at any moment.Also, the film is very respectful of it's audience, unlike many modern horror films, and doesn't try to force feed you information. Much of the film is silent, but the shot choices and subtleties in the performances explain to us the how and why. It manages to build tension better than almost any film of the past 5 years, and has almost no jump scares, except for one genuinely unexpected one that is very effective, and I don't say that often about jump scares.If there was one thing I could honestly say the film did wrong, it was it's opening shot. The opening shot shows the blind man dragging the woman by her hair down the street, and this was pretty much completely unnecessary. You could say it helps establish a vulnerability of the characters, but it does that pretty early on even without this shot. Also, this shot makes certain scenes preceding it much less tense than they should be, because we know exactly what is going to happen.The acting is noticeably not very good towards the beginning, but once the tension begins the performances become pretty believable, with Steven Lang being the obvious stand out here. The characters also have no development throughout the entire film, but they don't need any development. It's a very tightly written film. Pretty much everything that the characters do make sense because of who they are, where they come from, and their motivations. I don't think I'don't ever watch it again, simply because all of the enjoyment of the film comes from not knowing what is going to happen next, but I'd say it's pretty much a perfect little self contained package with a perfect cliffhanger ending. It serves its purpose (which is to make you very tense) almost as well as it possibly can.Finally, it's actually got a pretty good message: 'Some things in life you can't change, no matter how unfair they are'. In other words, you just have to tough some things out and continue on with your life, because there is truly nothing you could do about it (the lady bug is a good metaphor for this philosophy).",7,1,4,4 September 2016
Three Colors: Blue," Three Colors: Blue
","'Three Colors: Blue' is a film about Julie (Juliette Binoche) loses her husband, a famous composer, and her young daughter in a car wreck. The film follows the weeks after this incident, and how she tries to cope with their deaths. It is a film about grief and loss, and the entirety of this film is spent focusing on Julie, and her enigmatic, but not too obscure thoughts and feelings during her grieving process. Towards the beginning, it seems she feels nothing. Her husband and daughter may have been the only people she really loved, so their death has forced Julie to stare into the void and contemplate the meaning of her existence, if there is any. She clearly wants to forget about them completely and try to start anew, selling all of their belongings that remind her of them, including her house, and moving away. She plays her husband's unfinished symphony, and when she gets to the unfinished emptiness, blue light crowds the screen and she is suddenly reminded of his death. She destroys her husband's unfinished symphony, believing it cannot possibly be finished by anyone because no one can replace him. She does, however, bring with her the blue light that was in one of her rooms, showing she doesn't yet have the strength to completely leave him behind.Blue is obviously a very important color in this film, and it often represents longing and loneliness when it is used. For instance, Julie often goes to the pool on her own, and the water is often illuminating blue. She keeps coming back to it because she can't move past her family's death, no matter how hard she tries. The only other family member she visits is her mother, who barely remembers who she is. The use of color is pretty ingenious in many scenes, with green also symbolizing content occasionally. The music enriches this sense of longing, with Julie's husband's unfinished symphony being used again and again, each time with the screen fading to black mid-scene and fading back to the same scene. This symphony is a constant reminder of his absence, and the hole this has caused in her life. The cinematography is restrained and beautiful, perfectly exploring this character that is so perfectly portrayed by Juliette Binoche. Her performance in this film is just restrained enough to give us a sense of her true feelings while also seeming constantly complex and interesting. The end is one that I will probably think about for a long time after viewing. There are hints that she may find a way to move past her grief, but there are also hits that she may never fully recover. It is clear that she wants to move past it, but continues to be pulled back down into her depression, and it seems part of her wants to continue thinking about him and wallowing in her misery forever, because it is all she has left to do. This is one of those rare films where the entire thing is a deep exploration of one character, almost through the visuals, editing, music, and Binoche's performance alone. There is a lot of symbolism to unpack and deliberate over. It truly takes a hold of the film medium to deliver a complex, thoughtful, and constantly mysterious study of one character dealing with grief. It's biggest strength is its incredibly enigmatic and unpredictable nature, yet this was occasionally a flaw upon first viewing. This is a film I will definitely watch more than once, that much I can say.",9,1,1,19 January 2017
The Disaster Artist," The Disaster Artist
","Out of all the hilariously awful trash films that exist, from 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' to 'Troll 2' to 'Birdemic: Shock and Terror' to all of Neil Breen's films, none are as famous or as disconnected from normal human interaction as 'The Room'. And none of their creators are quite as intriguing and puzzling as the enigmatic Tommy Wiseau.But, as 'The Disaster Artist' makes clear, this cult classic never would've existed without his best friend, and co-star of the film, Greg Sestero. After witnessing Tommy's passionate performance of 'A Streetcar Named Desire' at his acting class, timid Greg Sestero approached him, asking if he could do a scene with him. Tommy of course said yes, and proceeded to help boost Greg's confidence by giving him an acting lesson in the middle of a coffee shop. From there, the two united over their shared ambitions of becoming Hollywood stars, and with Tommy's mysterious, seemingly unlimited supply of cash, they moved to L.A., and the rest is history.Of course, there's a lot more in between and after that, but if you've ever seen 'The Room' you basically know the end result. But 'The Disaster Artist' isn't primarily about the making of 'The Room', although that takes up the majority of the second half, it's main focus is the unlikely friendship between Greg and Tommy, who are played by Dave and James Franco, respectively. It could've been very distracting that two brothers were playing two best friends who were in no way related, but, due to James Franco's fittingly stilted performance, I wasn't focusing on that at all.Also, although he's been making pretty poorly reviewed films for years, this is Franco's first major directorial effort, and the first film of his that I have seen. From a visual standpoint, everything seems pretty standard, other than some opportune long takes during a few scenes, such as the tense, uncomfortable, and hectic shooting of Tommy's sex scene. From an acting standpoint, everything seems pretty standard, other than Franco's performance. From a general directing standpoint, everything just seems pretty standard. All of it is fine, and none of it is really special. The writing has a few flaws as well, such as one very unrealistic decision by Greg and an incredibly rushed ending. The bizarre subject matter of this film is honestly what really makes this film work.The Greg and Tommy dynamic worked as an eccentric and his straight man, but the funniest part of the film was its depiction of the disastrous production behind 'The Room'. It began with many confused cast members, but a faint glimmer of hope but slowly spiraled downward, with personal tensions rising between Tommy and the other members of the crew, shooting going far over schedule, and Tommy's strangeness disrupting several days on set, such as one day where he didn't pay for air conditioning. But, other than one scene at his lowest point, Tommy never comes across as malicious, just horribly ignorant and oblivious to his own mistakes, which is partially of why 'The Room' still reigns as the best bad movie ever made. Tommy single handedly created, ruined, and saved 'The Room', all in one fell swoop.Many watch 'The Room' and ask 'How could anyone who made this have thought it was good?'. And the truth is, they didn't. When the actress for 'The Room' character Claudette is asked why she would drive such a long commute every day for such an obviously doomed film, she replies 'Because we're actors. A bad day on set is better than a good day anywhere else'. 'The Disaster Artist' shows this kind of sheer commitment as both a virtue and a flaw, balancing between advocating pursuit of your wildest dreams despite everyone telling you otherwise, and warning against that pursuit.",6,2,3,9 December 2017
The Fountain," The Fountain
","'The Fountain' begins with the death of a conquistador who was searching for the tree of life, then cuts to that same man, but bald, now sitting next to the tree of life as he floats through the universe, then finally cuts back to present day where that same man frantically searches for a cure for cancer. This is all in the first few minutes.Of course, these three aren't all technically the same person - one exists far in the past during the Spanish inquisition (Tomas), another seems to exist in the future after death (Tommy), and the other exists currently (Tom Creo), but they all seem to have the same motivation. Tomas is trying to find the tree of life to grant him and his queen (played by Rachel Weisz) immortality, as her country is being taken over, Tom is trying to find a cure for cancer to save his wife Isabel (also played by Rachel Weisz) from death, and Tommy seems to be trying to keep the tree of life alive in the afterlife so that he can be with her for eternity.On its base level, the movie is really just about death, and how we should deal with it, and what comes after, and all the anxieties that go with that. As I mentioned before, the film starts with Tomas, the conquistador, being stabbed, and looking down at his stab wound with fear as blood pours out of his body. He knows he is slowly dying, but the film cuts away before he does. Each of the versions of Tom is in some way fighting against death, while Isabel is learning to accept it. Many times throughout each of three plot lines, Tom is told to 'Finish' his story and in each of them he struggles to do this. In one shot, he walks through the busy streets but the only audio we hear are his footsteps; he is unaware of the world around him.There are many smart artistic decisions such as this. Many of the shots are directly overhead the characters, as if they are being watched from above. As a contrast to this, there are a large amount of extreme close ups, showing how the Tom and Isabel cling to each other. Not to mention to often gorgeous special effects during the ethereal scenes involving Tommy as he ascends through the universe and into a nebula. But the film was incredibly ambitious for 2006 special effects, and occasionally they come off looking cheap and unintentionally funny, especially towards the end of the film during what should've been a very serious and awe- inspiring sequence. Also, Tommy doing martial arts moves in front of a space background was completely irrelevant to the story and themes, and ended up coming off as ridiculous and absurd.However, the film is elevated by Hugh Jackman's devastating performance in each of the three roles he plays. Rachel Weisz is fantastic as well, but one smaller performance that truly stood out was Ellen Burstyn as Dr. Lillian Guzetti. Her speech at Isabel's funeral towards the end of the film, although short, was one of the best scenes. As she says: 'We struggle all our lives to become whole. Complete enough when we die.' The film's message that the only way we can deal with our mortality is by accepting it as a natural part of the circle of life. Despite the ridiculously over the top visuals towards the end, it definitely has something interesting to say.",7,2,2,29 August 2017
The Witch," The Witch
","'The Witch' thrives on the suggestion of evil, which is truly the scariest evil of all. The film is based in 1630s New England during the early colonization of America. The characters are God-fearing and they are dedicated to their faith. It is what drove them to America, and it is implied that it is what got them banished from their town just at the start of the movie. The family moves out to the country to start their new home in isolation just outside the woods, and soon their infant child suddenly disappears.Of course, this is a result of the witch living in the woods, as revealed to us near the start of the film during an incredibly disturbing scene, complete with very unsettling music. The music in this film contributes greatly to its success; it's frantic, upsetting, chaotic, and grating, and it works perfectly to compliment the atmosphere of the film.As far as the setting goes, there is a striking attention to detail. The wardrobe, architecture, performances, and especially the dialogue, all done in old English, contribute to an incredibly accurate depiction that sucks the viewer right into that time period. This film heavily relies on its child actors for the majority of it, so thank God each and every one of them managed to have a convincing, realistic performance. The characters' dedication to their religion is ultimately what isolates each one, and causes their ultimate acceptance of evil. Since they follow all of these strict rules without question, it leads each of them to harbor repressed thoughts and hide their actions from each other, leading to a growing paranoia between all of them. It is a disturbing portrait of humanities' inclination towards evil.The cinematography and the dark, muted color palette evokes a genuine sense of dread. Subtlety is the key here. Something as simple as a shot being held for a little too long can put a viewer on edge. The tall trees in the forest loom over the family at every moment and the dense collection of trees and branches in the shots within the forest give a sense of being trapped and overwhelmed.The tension that is built in this film results from direction so confident you would never guess this is a debut. Horror movies need a real, universal fear in order to work, and in 'The Witch' it is the fear that we are all naturally inclined to evil, and there is nothing we can do about it.",9,0,3,3 December 2016
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs
","The best biopics are the ones that show their subject as the flawed individual that they are while also showing how their particular flaws and strengths are what propelled them to greatness, and sometimes threw them back down. Take, for instance, 'Raging Bull', 'Schindler's List', 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Amadeus', 'The Assassination of Jesse James', and Sorkin's own 'The Social Network'. I'm happy to rank 'Steve Jobs' among those films.Okay, so maybe it's a gross exaggeration to call it quite as good as those films, but it gets pretty much everything right, and it is probably the best film of 2015. The film is structured as sort of a 3 act play, with each act taking place right before 3 very important reveals for Apple. Although rather than starting at the beginning of Steve's career, it starts at probably his worst decline in his career, starting with the Macintosh conference. The first thing that we learn about Steve is that he needs everything exactly the way he wants it, no matter the cost. He is desperately trying to get the computer to say 'hello' only 45 minutes before the conference starts, even though the chief programmer tells him multiple times that it's impossible. We learn that Steve requires everything in his life to be under his control, which is why he doesn't want Wozniak to give the computer 8 slots, but 2 instead ('end to end control') and it's why he pushes out his daughter, since he believes he can't control her ('Your sons and daughters are beyond your command'). This fear of lack of control seems to go all the way back to when Steve was an infant and was adopted not once, but twice. However, his love for his daughter does shine through in moments, because he is, after all a human. During the middle passage of the film, Steve has been fired from Apple and is now trying to create the 'black box' at his new company, NEXT. At this point, he knows it's going to flop. He doesn't even have an OS ready for the conference, but rather a demo version of it. He is only starting to realize that he doesn't understand, as his daughter (and Jon Mitchell) puts it, 'life, love and clouds'. He is beginning to realize that everything is beyond his control. He now has even stronger feelings towards his daughter and when he gave money to his ex-wife, she spent it poorly. He was also fired from his job (in anew incredibly well written and edited scene) despite fighting hard against it, and even though it wasn't solely John Sculley's fault (in fact, he was just trying to let him off the hook easy), Steve pins it on Sculley, and refuses to apologize, because he didn't at least try to stand up for him. Still, Steve devises a plan to maintain control and it works. This time, Steve Jobs is back at Apple and introducing his new product, the iMac. He has come full circle and back to the top with sales predicted at 1 million, but he still has things to sort out. He has a conversation with Andy Hertzfeldt, the man he was forcing to make the Mac talk at the beginning. Andy cares for Steve's wife and daughter, so he does the sensible thing and pays for Steve's daughter's tuition for college since Steve wouldn't do it because he took his ex wife selling the house that he paid for as a personal insult to him to him from his daughter when in reality it was simply because she is having a tough time financially. He is angry at him for 'acting like her father', but Andy responds 'someone had to'. It only hardens the blow that Andy confesses to never liking Steve right after, and though he says he is indifferent as to whether people hate him or not, he seems upset. He also starts thinking about his daughter, and imagining talking to her. He then is shown by Joanna that the Time magazine at the beginning was never meant to be about him. He realizes that he is not always the center of attention and not everyone is out to get him. Next he is with Sculley, and now he realizes that he is not an efficient computer, but an inefficient human and he has to embrace his humanistic side because that is what he is and there is no escaping it. He even used to go to his birth father's restaurant but would never admit to it simply because it was only one more thing to worry about, a distraction in his eyes. It is then when he tries to make up with his daughter, ending in her yelling at him and exposing that he is just as flawed as the rest of us. She storms to the roof, and Steve Jobs follows. Like she predicted in the NEXT conference, his 'regretful' song has started playing. He tells her that LISA wasn't a coincidence, and is far more interested in her than the important conference. He is even willing to be late to it so he can hear one of her essays, and it is specifically emphasized earlier in the film that being late to these is something he would never do, not by a second. It is now, because of her and his concern for her, that he comes up with the idea for the iPod. Then he walks out onto the stage, with his daughter watching in the background, again something he wouldn't allow before, and without saying a word, both literally (camera wise) and figuratively puts her into focus and starts walking towards her with his back to his computer and his business.",7,6,12,13 July 2016
Sausage Party," Sausage Party
","Yes, this movie is very raunchy and filled with sexual innuendo, yes, it uses many stereotypes (racial or otherwise), but it's not stupid. OK, it is stupid, but it's stupid in a smart way.'Sausage Party' starts with a raunchy song condemning religion, and basically continues on that note. The film argues that if there is a God, he is indifferent to our well being. It states that our vision of God and the afterlife was simply invented to rid us of our constant fear of death. It does contain many stereotypes of all kinds, and it even has a rape scene (yes, a rape scene), but it's a film that actually condemns hate, and all of the pointless rules religion gives us that prevent us from doing what we enjoy, or even inspire hatred. The film says that since death and hatred and racism and violence are rampant among the human race, we should stop hating others for their differences and rather unite as one human race, and just have one big orgy. Okay, that last part is only partially true, but that's basically the point. We focus so much on our separate beliefs and versions of the afterlife and how to get there, that maybe we forget to just enjoy our life on earth.Aside from that message, it also has some seriously detailed animation, and some clever visual humor, which is something we don't get enough these days, and one of the strongest arguments for the fact that anything can be funny in certain context. To top it all off, it's an incredibly original idea, and probably one that can never be replicated again, and in the sea of reboots, remakes, and sequels that are thrown at us, this stands out, in all of its absurd, raunch- filled, excessive glory. And, yes, it genuinely made me laugh. Hard.",7,21,45,15 August 2016
Downfall," Downfall
","(Warning: There Will Be Spoilers)The Hitler in Downfall is not exactly the same Hitler we've seen before. He's just as hostile and hateful as we know, but here he is only a deeply insecure man masquerading as a powerful and strong one. 'Downfall' shows how unbelievably single- minded Hitler and his followers were, and how the few humane people were far too outnumbered to make a difference. Consider for instance a scene in which Hitler is going to kill himself and Magda Goebbels comes knocking at his door sobbing and falls to her knees hugging his legs, begging him not to do it. Then consider a later scene in which she murders her children because she doesn't want them to live in a world without Hitler. As she kills her children her face is completely emotionless. Then she walks out, sits down for a couple seconds, stands up and goes to play cards, like nothing ever happened. The most terrifying thing in this movie is how Hitler simply has no regard for human life. Hitler's world begins crumbling down on him and he brings everyone else down with him, and I mean EVERYONE. His country, his people, and even the few people truly close to him. Even after he basically announces to everyone that they're screwed, he continues to defend Berlin against Russia, knowing Berlin's fate, but convincing himself that he can withstand against it. He manages to convince himself that he is the courageous one and that all of the soldiers are being cowards, but ironically decides to kill himself.But the most important part of all of this is about the people he influences. As I describe him most people probably think 'how could anyone possibly follow this man?' and were given a glimpse to the first impression most people at the time would get with Traudl Junge. He would seem like a kind, powerful man to some, but his true personality was already hidden by the reputation he had built up, and in order to understand what kind of man he really was, we need to see him from a new perspective.While I believe the movie does make points like this through the actions of the characters, but none of its points are ever forced or hamfisted. It simply shows the facts and leaves the viewer up to decide what the point is. Also, while they are one-sided, it never shows Hitler or the Nazis as inhuman monsters, it shows them as scared, confused human beings that cling to an insecure, scared man that has unrealistically high expectations for Berlin.In short, I think 'Downfall' is a masterpiece and its greatest strength comes in how it gets it's point across through the actors' performances and the characters' actions, and I could go on explaining many incredible scenes and the point that each scene communicates, but that would be pointless. Just go watch the movie if you haven't seen it yet.",9,1,2,10 March 2016
Inception," Inception
","Christopher Nolan specializes in making smart films for mass audiences, and he succeeds completely once again. Not only does Nolan take a complex concept and make it easily digestible and also consistently entertaining, but he squeezes in a bit of a character study as well. OK, yes, the rest of the characters besides Cobb are all pretty much just plot devices, but they are all completely necessary for the film to work as well as it does. That doesn't mean the characters are just cardboard walls that spout information of course. They are still infused with some character, but they are all pretty much one shade besides Cobb. Cobb originally takes the job of Inception, which he said was impossible, and secretly doesn't want to do because he believes it is how he killed his wife, because he wants to get back to his children rather than be 'an old man waiting to die alone'. He has been exiled because his family believes he killed his wife, but deep down, Cobb does too. He still wants to be able to go back and change things, which is why he keeps his subconscious version of his wife, Mal, locked within cages of his memories. He uses his free time to explore his past memories and pretend she is still alive, but Mal is just a representation of his guilt over killing her, rather than actually her. This guilt is so powerful that his memories of her (and his children) burst through into other's dreams, notifying their subconscious that he is being controlled. This adds an extra layer of tension to every moment. But eventually, Cobb is forced to confront his subconscious version of her, and accepted that she is dead, and move on to live with his children. That is what the famous ambiguous ending is actually saying. The point isn't whether he is awake or asleep. It's that he no longer cares about that. He simply wants to move on and finally be able to love his children again, without ever looking back or feeling guilty about his past sins.Film was also the perfect medium for this idea. Think about how every time it cuts and a character is in a completely new place, we simply assume they just got there somehow. This film plays on that by telling us that if you can't remember where you came from, you could be dreaming. That is what makes that moment with Cobb and Ariadne at the market so mind blowing. Also, towards the end, when the film is frequently cutting between the 3 or 4 dream locations that they are in it often uses color to identify immediately which one we are in, so it never gets confusing or muddled. The first dream is blue from rain, the hotel dream is lit yellow, and the third layer is white with snow. Much of the fourth layer is done without cutting back to the others, but we immediately realize that Cobb is in the fourth layer, so once we see Cobb we know. It's simple things like this that makes this complex concept easy. There are also many hints that they are in a dream in the opening scene, such as the beach, the time slowing, and Mal, long before we find out how it all works. Then of course there are the fantastic action set pieces, such as the mind blowing and original spinning hallway scene, and the tense chase scene that leads to a tight squeeze through two buildings. The film works on every level. I just can't imagine a person who wouldn't like this film.",10,0,2,6 August 2016
Arrival," Arrival
","'Arrival' is a very cerebral film, but that doesn't mean that the film isn't intense, or thoroughly interesting and entertaining. While there may not always be something exciting happening on screen, in the traditional sense, there is always something to think about in what you are being shown and told.'Arrival' begins with a shot of a ceiling, panning down to show an empty house with a glass wall, and the deep horizon beyond that. Next, it begins a montage of personal memories. Louise Banks has a daughter, her daughter becomes a teenager, she is distanced from Louise, she is diagnosed with cancer, Louise's daughter dies. Over top of this is a speech about the chronology of memories and how she doesn't yet understand how they work. This is a perfect introduction to the film. It shows interpersonal relationships and memories connected to all that beyond us which we can't yet understand.When Louise first hears of the news of extraterrestrials, her first reaction is to continue every day life and her job as a linguist professor and expert, pretending as if nothing happened. Except empty, desolate shots of her walking through the building show us that no one shows up to her class. There is a sense that nothing truly matters to humans anymore. No one cares about classes, because they know there is so much beyond them, more advanced than them, that they couldn't possibly understand, and going to any class or job would now be pointless. They are reminded of their insignificance. Therefore, when Louise is given the chance to interact and understand these extraterrestrials (due to her cooperation with the government before), she goes for it. She could become significant.From this point on, the film becomes incredibly tense throughout. The fantastic soundtrack lends to an element of mystery. Villenueve handles the first encounters with the aliens slowly and deliberately, revealing a little information at a time and showing just enough to pique our interest and give tension to the scene. The end result made the encounters with the aliens genuinely awe- inspiring. However, even outside of the encounters there is always much to think about, and it's subtlety is the key to its success. It let's the audience the thinking about the ideas it presents. There is much shown about the various reactions to the aliens. Many gave up, seeing their arrival as evidence of their own insignificance in the universe, sending all moral codes and government established laws out the window. Some assumed that these aliens were a religious fulfillment, sent there by God for humanity. Some immediately assumed the worst of the aliens, taking an aggressive stance towards them and wanting to drive them away out of fear, and a desire to go back to normal life. All are wrong. Humanity is its own worst enemy. The correct response is to attempt to communicate with them and understand them. Louise levels with them as beings, and eventually she finds out we are just as important in the universe as these advanced beings, and one day may be even more advanced than them.Ian Donnely, a man working with Louise, claims that science and math are the only ways to communicate with the aliens. Louise thinks it's language, and she's right. After all, what's to say these advanced aliens don't have a completely separate set of mathematical and scientific laws and principles? What they definitely have is language. It is the only way to communicate experiences, therefore learn more and advance further.There is a theory stated in the film that the language you speak (or write) determines the way you think. Louise ultimately learns this through her experience.The way she thinks is entirely changed. Memories extend out in both directions, seeing her future as well as her past. All time is depicted as a solid, unchangeable loop, but this Predestination isn't depicted as a bad thing. Louise is able to accept her place in the universe, and her future life ahead of her. Her life is shown as happening as it should rather than happening beyond her control.As far reaching and mind-bending as these ideas are, there is always a focus on the personal lives and relationships of characters. Towards the beginning of the film, there is a larger sense of size and scale beyond ourselves, the framing often showing the characters as small and the spaceship and aliens as large in scope and size. Later in the film, however, the characters are often framed in the foreground, with the spaceship out of focus in the background, depicting their own lives as constantly their main focus rather than the bigger picture. No matter what, our personal experiences and relationships define us, no matter how advanced we become or how much more there is beyond us.There are a lot of ideas to digest in this film, and, while the entire film is interesting and thought provoking, the end is pretty mind blowing. This is definitely my favorite film of the year so far, and maybe a 10/10, but I'd need a second watch.",9,7,17,18 November 2016
Mary and Max," Mary and Max
","The wrinkly and awkward design of the characters and settings, as well as the dry dull color palette in 'Mary and Max' gives the film a gross, clunky texture, and I wouldn't want it any other way, because, like the characters themselves, the animation style's (intentional) imperfection is what makes it so charming.The film's premise is simple, but the emotional complexity of the characters get the premise a long way. A 9 year old Australian girl sending a letter to a 44 year old obese man in New York out of curiosity, but mainly out of loneliness, and it just so happens that the very person she contacts is just as lonely and confused as she is. Almost the whole movie is done in voice over, much of it by a narrator and the rest by the main two characters, since all of their interactions are through letters and not physical dialogue, and much of what they are saying and thinking is animated to accompany the voice over. But even the narrator has a distinctive character to it, and Still, Philip Seymour Hoffman is able bring life into this idiosyncratic character of Max, fully embodying all his sincerity in every word, despite an inability to physically communicate his emotions. The effect of the visualization of the voice-over is a somewhat storybook- like tone to the film. But despite seemingly like a film intended for children on the surface, it reaches into the subjects of depression, childhood trauma, and living with a mental disability. While it treats these subjects with as much respect and seriousness as they deserve, at the core of the film is, of course, the sweet friendship between Mary and Max, and how they each serve as a solace; someone they can understand and depend on in a world filled with unpredictability. Because they each knew there would always be a friend that could appreciate them even with all their imperfections, they were both able to accept themselves for who they were, warts and all.",8,0,1,27 June 2017
Mother!," mother!
","Imagine 'Rosemary's Baby' filtered through the dark and twisted creator of 'Black Swan' with a lot more symbolism and a lot less literal and you'd get 'Mother!', Darren Aronofsky's nightmare about a mother's isolation.From the start we are launched into the perspective of Mother (not a single name is ever said in the movie for any character). The film uses almost entirely close ups of Mother, over the shoulder shots, or point of view shots to emphasize this viewpoint. The sound design also adds another layer of immersion, accentuating the many small sounds made in Mother's home, and creating a three-dimensional landscape through the sound. This very limited perspective, as well as the fact that the film takes place entirely in one home, gives the film a claustrophobic atmosphere and often heightens the sense of paranoia.The set up is simple: a couple, comprised of a writer and the woman who built their home, is interrupted by a sudden unexpected guest. I don't want to go much further than that, but the sudden escalation of events is incredibly surprising and very bizarre if taken literally, but even as I wasn't entirely sure what exactly was happening I was pulled into the movie by the amazing performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris, and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although it may seem like a traditional psychological thriller film at the start, along the same lines as Aronofsky's own 'Black Swan', I can say by the end I had many lingering questions about what I had actually just seen and what exactly it meant. This is why I'm going to do a more in depth analysis below this, but this is where the spoiler free review ends.",8,5,16,15 September 2017
Trainspotting," Choose Trainspotting
","Trainspotting opens with the main character, Mark Renton, running away from the cops and it doesn't let up from there. The motif here is that the film begins with Mark Renton (literally) running away from responsibility, and that is practically what he is doing for the rest of the film. His (and his friends') way of doing this is by using heroin. At first, the film shows us the good parts of using the drug and describes why one would use it ('Take the best orgasm you've ever had and multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it), but the film progressively gets darker to show us the consequences of the drug, but without ever losing its energy and dark sense of humor. Most of the main characters in the film are not by any means good people, and they know they are not good people, but they are people regardless and each character is well rounded and believable. They are also incredibly well played by everyone in the cast, the most impressive performance obviously being Ewan Mcgregor's performance as Mark Renton. They know what they are doing to themselves when they use the drug, yet they still use it because of the good parts of the drug, which is why the film is so effective in showing the viewer why he or she shouldn't use the drug, even once.This is a very stylish film, but it isn't stylish without a purpose. The film uses its camera work and editing to put the viewer in the mind of a character that is on drugs, and to great effect. The soundtrack is worth noting as well; every song is used perfectly in its context, my favorite moment being when Mark overdoses and 'Perfect Day' by Louis Reef begins playing to show Mark's relationship to heroin, even in his lowest moment (also, the editing and camera work from Mark's point of view in that scene was perfect, you'll know what I'm talking about if you've seen it).Trainspotting is gross, sad, and dirty, while it is simultaneously energetic, entertaining, and funny. Pretty much all of the characters are bad people but they're also incredibly fun to watch. So if you're looking for a movie to watch, I have 2 words for you: choose Trainspotting",10,1,2,14 March 2016
Before Sunrise," Before Sunrise
","'Before Sunrise' is a film that is much, much better than it sounds on paper. It is mostly compromised of long takes of just these two characters, Jesse and Celine, who have just met on a train, talking. Just talking, about anything. Much of it on their various philosophies on life and about themselves. They are seemingly more honest to each other than to anyone else they know, such as in the fake phone call scene, and it shows in Ethan Hawke's and Julie Delpy's chemistry in this film, which is some of the best of any romance film ever. They both give fantastic performances, and they seem to completely inhabit their characters. It's possible that the film wouldn't work if it were any other two actors, and because they are so perfect for their roles, we end up believing every single word that they say, unlike many other romance films. This is a film that is very easy to get lost in, whether it's the fantastic and natural but revealing dialogue or the fantastic acting and chemistry between the leads or the long, long tracking shots in which the flow of the actors and their dialogue all come together so perfectly to pull us completely into their relationship. But we get so lost in the moment, as the characters do, that it's gone before we realize it, and we come to the harsh realization that their time together must come to an end for a long period of time. They say that they will meet on that exact day, six months from them, but we never really know. As we saw earlier they completely forgot about the play that they were asked to go to, and 6 months from now, sadly, who knows if they will remember to come? We also are hinted at the beginning of hard times to come when the film opens with an older foreign couple fighting and neither of the two main characters understand the language their speaking in, but it's also a metaphor for how they don't understand their struggles.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Lord of the Rings: Return of the King
","'Return of the King' is an incredible end to an incredible series. At many points in the film, it almost seems as if all hope is lost. A king is upset that his son Boromir died, so he takes it out on his other son, Faramir, when he is in desperate need of help against Saruman's forces. Then when Faramir is brought back (seemingly) dead, he assumes the worst and sets up a ritual for his body to be burnt. Of course Gandalf comes in at the last moment and the king ends up being burnt and only just after he sees that his son is alive. Frodo is deceived by Golum and tells Sam to go home, symbolically choosing his bad side over his good, or his Golum over his Smeagle, respectively. He has self control. Merry is taken away from Pippin. Gandalf even seems to have lost hope in the situation. But the characters prevail. We see a shot of Frodo hunched over Golum, strangling him after Golum betrayed him, but unlike Golum, Frodo stands up and stops, showing how Frodo is different from Golum. Sam falls down the stairs trying to back, but returns right when Frodo is at his most vulnerable, and despite being tossed around and almost killed by a monster, he kills it, which shows how much they need each other, and again how every man needs someone to lean on. Merry decides to fight for his friends despite not being with them. Aragorn fights to get more people to fight with them against Saruman's army.This is one of the greatest strengths of this film. Putting aside the fantastic and believable character arcs that develop over these three movies, and the incredible, epic action scenes, with special effects that hold up surprisingly well, there's something that really stood out to me. In the beginning, a fellowship is assembled that puts together some unlikely companions who end up becoming friends through their experiences and further understanding of each other. This care for each other is what drives them and gives them courage in the worst situations. This begins to happen on a larger scale in the third film. The elf army is now uniting with the humans, when only just recently they were arguing with each other. The ents fight against Saruman's forces as well. Then in the next film, this continues to grow in scale, with everyone they could possibly get uniting against Sarumans forces, and this is mainly to help Sam and Frodo who are in their own task. This is not just relevant to the film, but to the world. There is much evil in the world, and we need to be able to depend on each other to help get rid of it. No one man can do it on his own, and every man has a part to play.But the greatest part of this film is its ending. This film has an incredibly bittersweet ending in which I actually found myself tearing up and nearly crying on multiple occasions, which almost never happens to me in movies. Sam at one point on the mountain says 'We may not have a journey back to the shire' shortly before they destroy the ring, but this line coming from the most optimistic character in the movie shows that he has accepted the idea of death. Pippin and Gandalf do this earlier in the film in a conversation they have about death, and the end of the film is about this acceptance. Death is inevitable, but it's not always a bad thing, and we have to accept that at some point or another our time will come for all of us, it just comes faster for others.",10,2,3,28 May 2016
What We Do in the Shadows," What We Do in the Shadows
","What is missing from a lot of comedies these days is visual comedy. The YouTube channel 'Every Frame A Painting' did a video on Edgar Wright perfectly explaining this, and using this as a reason why Edgar Wright is the smartest comedy director currently out there. Basically, thanks in no small part to Judd Apatow, most of the comedies of the past 10 years have basically been mostly comedic improv on screen, and even if it is scripted that is an accurate description of what it feels like. And even when they do improv the actors aren't skilled enough to portray the unique, hilarious characters in films such as 'Best in Show' and 'This is Spinal Tap'. This is where 'What We Do in the Shadows' comes in.This film combines some hilarious visual comedy elements similar to Edgar Wright, while also including the mockumentary improv style of Christopher Guest, and while filmmakers Taika Waititi and Jermaine Clements don't quite reach the heights of those two directors, they craft an original, very funny comedy.The film gets right into it. For the first 6 minutes basically everything is a joke, and it's pretty hilarious, but I was immediately skeptical about how long they could go with this premise while still being funny. The answer is: surprisingly long, even if it begins to feel one note towards the end of the film.For those unfamiliar with the premise, there is a group of vampires that meet in a flat in New Zealand, hang out, go to clubs, and casually live their lives as vampires.The film is basically filled with clever moments playing into vampire lore, and hilarious lines (that I will not spoil). The film is It's also surprisingly heartfelt. It's actually about the value of friendship, and finding people who accept who you are. There isn't really much more to say. It's funny and clever and by the end of the film they've pretty much milked all that they could out of the premise and then some. It's definitely one of the better comedies I've seen recently. Hilarious cast of characters, great performances, and surprisingly great visual effects, mostly done practically.",7,1,4,13 November 2016
Ran," Ran
","'Ran' is a poignant epic based on Shakespeare's King Lear. Many call it one of the best (if not the best) Shakespeare film adaptations, and while I haven't seen enough Shakespeare films to say for sure, it's hard to see any other one topping this one.The film begins on huge rolling hills, where Lord Hidetora has gathered his acquaintances and his three sons. He blacks out, and suddenly he decides he will choose his successor right there. He picks his oldest son, Taro. Taro and the middle son, Jiro, suck up to their father by saying they will serve him loyally until his death. The youngest son, Sabaro, knows exactly what is going on. He calls them out on it. Then Lord Hidetora decides he will give power to all three of his sons, but Sabaro once again sees flaws in this. He knows the three brothers will not get along. He is banished, since Hidetora needs everyone to be loyal and follow him blindly, rather than taking criticism when he needs to.This causes a slow downward spiral. Taro is convinced by his wife, whose family was killed and village was burned by Hidetora, to force his father to give him complete power, but he is clearly not cut out for being a King. He already can't control his soldiers. Hidetora leaves the kingdom and while he is gone, Tango Hiragana, one of his advisers, comes to him with gifts given from peasants. Hidetora is told that the samurai never accepts charity, so he orders the peasants dead, but he finds out from Tango that those peasants were told by Taro to never send food to Hidetora, or else they will die. These people were pushing away Taro and asking for Hidetora back, but he just killed them. Tango suggests Hidetora should put Sabaro as king, but Hidetora didn't want the truth. He now has no where. Hidetora is told that Tango is just trying to stir up trouble between his family and take the throne for himself. He pretends that he did nothing wrong, but this causes his downfall. Both Taro and Jiro betray him and invade the castle at the same time, in an incredibly violent and intense scene. Not only have Hidetoras sons betrayed him, but all of his loyal followers have died in front of his face and it was his fault. Despite nearly dying many times, and arrows and gunfire flying all around him, Hidetora comes out alive, and what follows is his punishment, his personal hell. He confronts all of his past atrocities, such as a boy whose family he killed, and eyes torn out. The wreckage of a palace he burnt to the ground. But the two most truthful people in the film, aside from Sabaro, Lady Kaede, his loyal jester whom he saves earlier in the film (part of what shows Hidetora has the potential to be a good person, since she jokes about his foolishness frequently), and Tango. They look for Sabaro. Meanwhile, his son Jiro, who killed his other son that was taking the throne, is sitting atop the throne, but he is being controlled by his brothers widow, who is now his wife. She threatens him and then she controls him by earning his trust. Jiro isn't strong enough to be a leader of his own, so he succumbs to blind loyalty to his new 'wife'. Sabaro confronts Jiro, and this is where Jiros downfall begins. He is told by many that he shouldn't start a war with Sabaro, and he tells Sabaro he won't, yet he stabs him in the back the first chance he gets. He attacks, but Sabaro has a plan. There are men in the woods firing guns at the oncoming attackers, and despite Jiros orders, which they don't want to follow since he didn't truly earn their trust, the men retreat. Jiros wife reveals that she was just trying to get revenge for her family, and she did it. Then she is killed. Sabaro then reunites with Hidetora, and Hidetora at first can't forgive himself and doesn't think Sabaro will forgive him, but he comes to his senses and seems completely changed, and he essentially had redeemed himself. All he cares about anymore is Sabaro. Then Sabaro is killed by one of Jiros soldiers. Lady Kaede blames the gods who she worshiped, but the true blame is on man. As one soldier states, the gods try to make things right, but man has to always go and make things worse. We have an obsession with violence and our rulers will always continue to kill and kill, until the rational ones die and the cycle repeats itself. Then we get a poignant shot of Tsurumaru, the kid who had his eyes torn out, dropping a portrait of Buddha as he stands atop a mountain, showing how humans themselves deny justice from the gods and truly control things. And the good will always go out with a whimper, not a bang. They don't get to go out as valiant soldiers.",9,0,2,24 July 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," John Wick 2
","With the plethora of terrible and unnecessary sequels these days, recently 'Inferno', 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back', and 'Independence Day: Resurgence', 'John Wick 2' is a welcome and refreshing surprise.Right off the bat, the film starts with a chase, and it rarely lets up. After this opening chase, which concludes with John getting his car back, he is confronted by Santino, a man that he made a sacred oath with in order to escape the underworld of hit men was involved in. Since he came back to that world in the first film (and the beginning of this one), he has broken this oath. He is now brought back in to (supposedly) do one last favor for the man that he owes.The character of John Wick himself is actually quite a troubled one. As you know if you've seen the first one (which you should watch if you plan to watch this one), John Wick had a wife that died, and now all he has left from that time in his life is his dog and his car. He is first forcefully brought back into the hit-man lifestyle, but it is possible that he enjoys his rampages and fits of vengeance, because without a wife or a home, it is all he has. At the same time, he clearly feels guilt and regret for much of what he's done, and what he's lost because of his actions. John is lonely, and his loneliness twists him throughout the story.While John Wick may be surprisingly layered for an action hero, the film is also incredibly efficient in the information we are given and how it is given to us. John Wick is the strong, silent type, and most of what we know about him is shown through the editing and the acting, which bluntly conveys exactly what it should, with a very physical performance from Keanu Reeves. The many other performances in the film are fantastic as well, especially Ian Mcshane and the short cameo by Laurence Fishburn. The world building is also impressively done, with most of it just being shown to us, and only what needs to be explained being explained to us, such as the two rules of this business. Sometimes, character and world building is woven into the action. Oh, and what incredible action. This has - hands down - some of the best action scenes in this decade, and probably even in subsequent decades before it. Chases, hand to hand combat, shootouts, you name it; it's all here, and it is all fantastically shot and edited, perfectly choreographed, and consistently creative and intense. The frame is wide and the shots each last long enough to have a clear view of the brutal and precisely choreographed action, unlike many action scenes in modern Hollywood. There were several moments where my jaw was literally dropping at how intense and consistently original all of the action was. Even though John takes out hundreds of people, there is always a genuine sense of struggle in each fight, and each encounter is unpredictable, with a constant sense that a fight could break out at almost any moment.The constantly vibrant color palette, the stylized subtitles, and the sense of humor throughout the film also all show that the film isn't taking itself too seriously. It knows that it is over the top, and it realizes the absurdity of the situations, and often makes comedy out of it. It is self aware about the crazy 80's-style action shclockiness; it knows exactly what it is, which is a non-stop, full force, fun action film, with just enough time in between to give context, characters, and motivations that you understand. It is the rare sequel that surpasses its predecessor, and one of the best action films I've seen in ages.",8,16,33,10 February 2017
Her," Her
","Our world today is filled with many nice conveniences thanks to the rapidly advancing rate of technology, yet this reliance on technology can cause us to feel distant and disconnected. No film embodies this more than 'Her', Spike Jonze's quasi-futuristic love story in which Theodore, a lonely and recently divorced man, begins to fall in love with Samantha, an Artificial Intelligence.While the premise may sound like it would be executed with a comedic or satirical tone, Spike Jonze wrote and directed this with a realistic and serious tone. Instead of mocking Theodore, the film empathizes with him, and does so surprisingly effectively. The film centers around Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson (even though it's just her voice) and they both needed to be pretty much perfect in order for the film to actually be involving and interesting, and somehow they pull it off. Theodore's job is essentially writing deeply personal greeting cards between people, and this job itself says a lot about Theodore. He is thoughtful and emotional, yet he's disconnected from those around him, which is also shown through the cinematography. The environment surrounding him is often out of focus, even in the opening shot. As he walks through the streets, he is depicted as very small and at the bottom of the frame. It is ultimately this feeling of disconnect from other people that leads him to get an AI, ad it's ultimately what leads him to start a romantic relationship with her. The romantic relationship between this man and his AI could've easily come off as unintentionally funny and awkward, but the romance develops believably and understandably from the perspective of both Theodore and Samantha. The cinematography also shows the connection between both characters. In many of the scenes in which Theodore is with Samantha, the camera closes in on him, almost as if the fact that he is alone in the room is disappearing, and he feels as if he is really with Samantha.In one scene, Samantha hires a 'sex surrogate' to aid her relationship with Theodore, despite Theodore's feelings against it. This 'sex surrogate' is essentially a person who acts as a physical representation of an AI in order for them to have sex (she isn't a prostitute, just someone very passionate about helping their relationship). In this scene, Theodore essentially goes full circle. One of the main reasons he started this relationship was because he couldn't handle the difficulties of a human relationship, and now that Samantha is being physically represented as a human, he is beginning to realize how far she actually is from being human, and now he feels as if the relationship he has with her isn't a real relationship, and he feels guilty for not being able to handle a human relationship, so he ends up distancing himself from Samantha as well.Who he eventually goes to is Amy, his long time friend who was recently divorced to her husband, and who also has a friendship with an AI. The advice she essentially gives him is that he has to allow himself to be happy. He shouldn't overthink and worry about everything, because that would just ruin it. This doesn't just apply to maintaining his relationship with her, but ending it. When Theodore comes to the sad realization that Samantha is outgrowing him, just as his former wife did, instead of wallowing in his loneliness, and essentially distancing himself from others, he decides he must accept it and move on. And just as he does with Samantha, Theodore says goodbye to his ex-wife in the form of a letter. And finally, when he has said goodbye to them, he comes right to Amy, once again allowing himself to be happy.This may be a story with a strong feeling of loneliness, yet even in the opening shot, the film shows that we all share this feeling. Although the background in the first shot is at first out of focus and Theodore seems to be alone, the camera pulls back revealing all of the other people with the same job as Theodore, and that everyone around him is just like him. Similarly, when Samantha sends a compilation of Theodore's best letters to the head of a publishing company, the man who receives it connects deeply with these personal writings. Even though our experiences are uniquely personal, what Theodore doesn't realize is that they are also universal.The sci-fi elements of the film are handled extremely well. No one ever explains what anything does or what anything is in this film, yet it is easy to tell visually what everything is. This is a very realistic vision of the future, while most are very exaggerated in some way (even the great ones). New video games, new fashion style, new smartphones (which are now pretty much just an ear piece that you speak to), everything is simply shown yet it is easily understood what all of these are and how they have evolved from how they are now. Simply put, this film respects the intelligence of the audience. Also, rarely has a movie's soundtrack so perfectly fit the tone of the film and the tone of each individual scene that each song is used in.The film is an original love story that makes it easy to connect to it's characters, yet it is also thematically deep, and it creates one of the most unique and realistic visions of the future that I have ever seen. I pretty much love everything about this movie.",10,0,1,26 December 2016
The Birds," My Favorite Hitchcock Film
","There is a famous quote from Hitchcock that goes something like this: 'Suppose two people are having a conversation at a dinner table and there is a bomb underneath this table. Nothing happens, and then all of a sudden, 'Boom!' There is an explosion. The public is surprised, but prior to this surprise, it has seen an absolutely ordinary scene, of no special consequence. Now suppose that the audience knows there is a bomb underneath the table and they know when it will explode. That is suspense.'Now I was paraphrasing that quote a bit, but my point is that of all of Hitchcock's films, this analogy applies best to 'The Birds'. Consider for instance the scene in which Melanie is waiting outside the school for Annie and the birds have already been established as a threat. It starts by Melanie sitting down on the bench, and in the background you can see a bird fly down onto a metal structure on the playground. She is waiting for the children to finish their song, but it keeps getting longer and longer, and it keeps cutting away to show birds coming down, one at a time, each time you think the song will be over. Eventually Melaniece notices a bird flying above her, and the shot of the bird flying is held for a while, so you begin to suspect something sinister about to happen. Then the bird comes down onto the metal structure, the camera still following it, to reveal the entire playground covered in a field of birds. This isn't the only scene like this in the movie, however. In fact, practically the entire movie is like this. OK, yes, the special effects are a bit dated in some scenes, but that definitely doesn't take anything away from the overall terror of the birds. The thing that makes this film so suspenseful is the idea that the birds are constantly lurking over this town, and they can strike at any moment. This is thanks in no small part to the sound design. Even in the moments where you believe the characters are safe, you'll here a squawk or a flutter of Wings somewhere near them. And in the attack scenes, let's just say whatever the special effects lack in these scenes, the sound design makes up for. There is no non-diegetic music in this film, only the overwhelming squawking and screeching and scratching of hundreds of birds.The fact that they never truly reveal why the birds are attacking people definitely adds to the suspense, but it really isn't relevant anyway. The birds are really a metaphor for the pressure the mother (and mothers in general) feel when the last person they truly understand is being taken away from them, and the pressure that Melanie (and Mitch to some extent) feels when the mother is trying to cling to Mitch and push Melaine away.One interesting scene is the one that takes place in the diner. An old woman overhears Melanie talking on the phone about the birds, and decides to give them her two cents. She seems to empathize with them, saying they are misunderstood and mistreated by humans. A man comes in and says they are evil creatures and deserve to be killed. Then a mother who has heard the conversation from the beginning chimes in and says it doesn't matter, all she cares about is protecting her children. This scene adds to the metaphor by showing how other people view mothers and finally how a mother thinks. The old woman empathizes with the mothers. She understands them, and knows that most people don't. The angry man just thinks they're rude and rotten for no reason. The mother doesn't care. She just wants to cling to what she loves most.",9,0,1,30 March 2016
Sully," Sully
","MINOR SPOILERSWhen most people hear the name Captain Sully, they probably think 'hero', but ask him, or his family, and they'd describe him as a regular man. This film delves into his true feelings after the flight, and shows that for as much as he did for those people, he still felt as if he didn't deserve his praise. He felt that maybe the lawyers he was fighting against were right, and he actually endangered the people on that plane.We see that before the flight, Sully has has nightmares of almost the same thing happening before, but in those dreams, he crashes into buildings and dies, bringing many of the people on board with him. He constantly fears this loss of control in his plane, since it seems it is all he can truly control in his life. What does he say just before the engines go out in the real life incident? 'Life is better in the air'. He has probably thought about this many times, and this is probably why he maintains such a calm attitude about it as it is happening, as we see when we see the crash from the pilots' point of view. But still, he doesn't want the fame, because part of him feels he doesn't deserve it, no matter what everyone tells him. There is a great shot of Sully jogging through the streets, as his shadow grows in the smoke in front of him, and news reports of the crash can be heard in the background, showing Sully running from this false image of himself portrayed in the media.The film's structure revolves around his life after the flight, and his struggles with an insurance company working for the plane that was landed into the river. There are many flashbacks and flash forwards, and we are able to see Sully as who he is: A man. We also get to see the crash from first the point of view of the passengers, then the pilots. Some of the passengers are introduced swiftly to us, as the camera glides from person to person, getting us to care just enough for each one. Despite already knowing exactly what happens, these scenes of the planes crash are very intense. Since we know these people now, it is nerve wracking to see them put into such a near death experience. The camera gets shakier than usual, and you can tell the people don't think they are going to make it out alive. This makes it all the more alarming when we see how calm and collected Captain Sully is through all of this. Also, for a film that should be inherently predictable, it somehow remains unpredictable, specifically during the human flight simulations.In the end, we realize that we place all of the credit for everyone coming out OK on Sully, but in truth, it was everyone involved. If one person simply hadn't done their job, one person or more could've died. This includes the passengers, if they hadn't been smart, and stayed relatively calm while listening to what they were told to do, they would be dead. It was a miracle across the board that everyone turned out alright.",7,1,3,11 September 2016
All the President's Men," All the Presidents Men
","'All the Presidents Men' isn't about the water-gate scandal but the incredible journalism required to uncover it, and the overwhelming repression of the facts that Nixon achieved by abusing his power.We meet Woodward and Bernstein who seem to compliment each other so well that their boss not only assigns them to uncover water-gate together, but he nicknames them Woodstein. Bernstein has been in the business since he was 16, so he has more experience with writing than Woodward, who got to the Washington Post 9 months before the beginning of water-gate. However, Bernstein is light on facts, and he's desperate for a story so he infers more than he uses factual evidence. Woodward, on the other hand, is an honest man that has a drive to uncover the truth that is unmatched by Bernstein. They compliment each other perfectly.The film gets a bit confusing plot-wise towards the end, but what it succeeds at is making the viewer feel how Woodstein felt, and revealing the extent to which Nixon went to cover up details, as well as the sheer scale of the scandal. The way in which the film slowly unravels the scandal until Woodward realizes he and no one else is safe is perfect. The film is surprisingly comedic at many moments, such as the long shot of how Bernstein got into a certain meeting, as well as (of course) many very tense moments, including one long take that slowly, almost imperceptibly zooms in on Woodward while people gather in the background, showing Woodward's focus, as well as ours. This scene is particularly involving and exciting, despite just being a man talking on the phone, because of this reason. Anot her one is a scene in which they are trying to confirm who 'P' is. The set up is crucial for that one. The film is chock full of these moments, they allows us feel the tension and paranoia that they did, the latter being most notable in Woodward's multiple meetings with 'Deep Throat', which take place in an empty, dimly lit garage in which we never get a clear shot of Deep Throat's face, making him mysterious, and in one scene, scary. It's an incredibly involving movie, and it's final shot reflects it's message perfectly: two TVs playing Nixon being elected in front of and behind Woodward and Bernstein, who face each other, writing in between the two TVs. Nixon is on the outside, smiling as many people cheer around him. But at the core of this image are two people, Woodward and Bernstein, uncovering the scandal from the inside with nothing but typewriters.",9,2,2,28 August 2016

It is then a huge surprise when a new girl in his office named Natalie Keener presents a plan involving Internet video calls in which they fire employees in order to cut costs. This threatens Ryan's lifestyle of constantly moving, and the irony here is that despite how much Ryan moves around in his life, he can't handle a change to his system. What he begins to realize through his travels with Natalie and his meet ups with Alex is that he shouldn't be alone. What currently drives him the most is his goal of getting 10,000,000 miles, but perhaps he finally found someone he can spend his life with. In many shots, Alex is shown above Ryan, as someone Ryan looks up to, unlike everything else in life, which he views from his comfortable chair in the sky.He brings Alex to his sister's wedding, whom he barely knows, and he reveals a need to keep a meaningful relationship with his sister by asking to walk her down the aisle, but her fiance's uncle is already doing it. He doesn't realize that he is practically non-existent to them. He wants the positives of a long term relationship, but the lifestyle he's chosen has consumed him. Alex is the only person he has a chance with.When Ryan is giving his speech to a room filled with people, he suddenly has a revelation. Unlike the past 2 seminars we have seen, the focus this time is not at all on the audience. The camera slowly closes in on Ryan, and before he can deliver his line about burning the backpack, he stops. When the camera cuts to behind him, his audience is completely out of focus. He is not there. He leaves and goes directly to Alex's house, finally realizing she is the one thing he doesn't want to let go.She, however, has a life beyond her vacations. She has a home and a family, and is grounded by them. Ryan is her escape. Ryan, however isn't grounded by anything. He finally gets his 10 million miles, but it's not nearly what he expected it to be. It's ultimately more meaningless than marriage, which, while hard, is worth it. It keeps people motivated, while Ryan's 10 million mile goal was just a goal. Still, it's too late for him. He's gotta keep moving at this point, whether he wants to or not. The sad truth is that even if he wants to settle down, he can't catch up with those around him.Natalie leaves the company, because, ironically, she can't handle goodbyes. This is why she detaches herself through video chat and text. Ryan remembers her however. He gives her a recommendation for her new job, but he must once again let go of his baggage and continue to move.",8,1,2,3 November 2016
