Resident Evil: Afterlife," The Best 3D movie after Avatar
","Firstly this movie has to be seen in 3D as the effects are mind-blowing. It starts of great with crazy shooting where bullets and debris fly at you and the action is carried on in the whole movie which is truly awesome in 3D especially the fight scene with the executioner and all. There is nothing great about the plot and is basic as it can get, no character developments and its not really scary even though there were parts that made me jump. I didn't go to this movie with great expectation and came out very much pleased because I wanted to see a superb action movie in 3D and got more than I wanted. This has to be the best 3D action movie ever !!!",9,13,29,15 September 2010
