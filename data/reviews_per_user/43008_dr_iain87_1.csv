The Devil's Advocate," Amazing!! - Watch this film more than once.
","I don't usually like the usual law films and only saw this after repeated recommendation, after watching it I found that this isn't a 'usual law film' but so much more. I found this film disturbing, thrilling and thought provoking. In this film I saw one of the best performances by Keanu Reeves (Who before I saw this I wasn't a great fan of) and Charlize Theron. Also some of the best acting ever from Al Pacino - Especially his two monologues. The story of the film is so good you can watch it again and again and still be impressed. The script is written superbly and the direction and soundtrack are top notch (especially Rolling Stones - Paint It Black). For me this film is Definitely a 10/10.",9,1,1,17 August 2004
