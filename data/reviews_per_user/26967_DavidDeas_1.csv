The New World," 'Paradise and Director/Writer Lost '
","John Smith was not Irish so this first error , re-enforced constantly by Colin Farrell's miscasting together with his accent set the tone for this accurately set movie being spoiled by its inaccurate plotting of Smith , Rolfe and Pocahantas . Beautifully to look at , but at times its incoherence taken with the inaccuracies , made even this pale . This is so obviously a missed opportunity given the Director/Writer's talents . Maybe once again the creator was to close to his project and needed an experienced old head to guide his hand at the right time . Mallick needs more discipline , or his cinematic vision will be lost and his promise not fulfil ed .",4,0,4,7 July 2006
