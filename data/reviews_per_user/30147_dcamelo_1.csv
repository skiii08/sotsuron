The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Excellent, perfect, worth seeing multiple times, WOW!
","Anyone who doesn't think this film was a home run, either isn't a fan of the series or just doesn't have an ounce of romance in their body. This absolutely was the second best yet (Twilight being the first). Bella and Edward's journey couldn't have been shown any different and Bill Condon went right to the heart of it and did a brilliant job of bringing it to fruition. This movie will be seen by this fan at least a half dozen times or more. The emotion and sacrifice and love they brought to Bella and Edward were what had me reading Breaking Dawn over and over. I have always loved seeing and reading about epic love stories and this one, by far, has exceeded all expectations. Bravo!",10,7,20,18 November 2011
