United 93," Stunning
","I saw the third showing locally of United 93 on its opening night. It seemed most realistic, just as it should. It stunned our near capacity audience just as much as the characters it portrays. You will relive 9/11 without being shown how to think. To me the attempt was successfully made to reveal much of what was actually happening that day, particularly at the level of those officials on duty at the time, as well as from the vantage point of the passengers themselves. I deeply appreciate that United 93 is dedicated to our friends, neighbors and relatives who lost their lives that day; and therefore to the decided passengers of United 93 who quickly arrived at their tough yet logical decision. As one who uses human personality in my daily work, the characters are real; seemingly accurate to several of the actual folks on board United 93 on September 11, 2001.",9,3,7,29 April 2006
