Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Having rewatched this movie
","After initially writing this movie off as stupid and insulting years ago a rewatch changed my opinion significantly: while this is not an easy movie to sit through it is laugh out loud hilarious, and while offensive a work genius. It must have taken a lot of wit and courage from the actors playing Borat, the camera man and, anyone else in on the fact a mockumentary was being made, to pull this off knowing the difficult and embarassing situations they put themselves and other people into. Also they must have known the backlash revealing the whole act to their targets would cause. Does this movie reveal anything about human nature because of what they did and said in 'Borat''s presence? Yes and no: yes, because extreme situations can reveal the worst and best in people; no, because situations were forced onto them by actors without their knowing or permission. Would it be more telling had they reacted to people who really were as 'Borat' was depicted? Who knows. The movie looses points for being offensive and what its targets must have gone through during filming; it gains several for being a laugh out loud work of genius. 9/10",9,0,0,4 July 2020
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Mindless but not bad, just average->
","This movie hardly impressed me in either way. The dinosaurs didn't make an unrealistic impression, the vehicles and equipment didn't impress me at all (judging by their looks they were supposed to impress me.) As far as I can tell there are no huge problems in logic, (watch Timecop for a really messed up story full of holes in logic) then again, there wasn't much of a story to mess up. What probably would have made this movie better was people doing more than running and screaming (they did do some other things but not much else), the movie also could have used some more humor (Independence Day had lots of it and probably made the movie a lot better than it would have been without.) This movie gets a 6/10.",6,0,1,27 December 2000
Back to the Future," A lot of fun->
",this is a very good movie. I have seen it about three times and it still is a lot of fun to watch. The movie has a near perfect story with several nice little details. There is a tiny bit of questionable logic in the story which would normally make me give a 9 to a movie like this (you can't give a 9.9 here at the IMDB.) Since this movie is near perfect and still is a lot of fun after about three times I will round a 9.9 up to a 10.,10,1,2,23 December 2000
