Requiem for a Dream," One of those films your mind returns to for weeks
","The directing, cinematography and acting in this film is nothing short of genius. The film starts and within moments you can feel a unique style developing that stays throughout. The build-up of suspense is quite amazing in that it continues all the way from the start to the inevitable and crushing end. At moments I thought it can't possibly get any more hectic then the next scene would simply blow my socks off. Darkly amusing and very sad in places this movie is both disturbing and strangely satisfying. Really impressed by the director, Darren Aronofsky's ability to put this tale onto film. Thankfully he has a few more projects on the go which i'll go see as soon as they're released. Ellen Burstyn is brilliant as the lead's lonely mother and in my opinion steal's the show. Strongly recommended.",9,0,1,6 January 2006
