Walk the Line," Absolutely Wonderful!!
","We went to see the film 'Walk The Line' to hear the music, but were smitten by the acting of Joaquin and Reece - they WERE Johnny Cash and June Carter. We never realised the love story between the two and it was amazing. It really captured the era, and brought the 1950s and 60s to life. What amazing people they were, and their love for one another was the overriding message in the film - no one anywhere could come between them - they were one! We had to go back and see the film again, and since then have bought the CD of the film and three other Johnny Cash/June Carter CDs. We are eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD in May 2006. If you haven't seen this film, then GO! It's a MUST!",10,2,4,15 April 2006
