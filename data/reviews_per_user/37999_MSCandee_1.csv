Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Greatest Love Story Ever Told
","I do believe QT has written the greatest love story ever told, a story of loss, not dealing well with that loss, finding it again and accepting what the outcome had to be.  For two people in this movie.  I think Bill's love for Bea is parallel to Bea's love for B.B.  While we all know these are two different types of love their stories are the same in this movie.  For a moment when Bea walks into that room and sees that little girl there is a glimmer of hope that maybe they can forgive and forget and be a family, but it is Bill's eyes that let us know it can't be.  He knows Bea well enough to know she will finish what she started.  I honestly believe that this is the story of true love on many levels.",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
