50 First Dates," One of the greatest movies of all time
",It's an age old movie that is heartwarming with many great messages intertwined in it.,8,1,2,9 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," You really can't ask for a better action movie
","It had everything you could ask for in a movie and more. The only genre it doesn't really touch is romance. It has the drama, the comedy, the action, the clever and often heartwarming dialogue, the personal struggles, the betrayals, fulfilling character archs that make sense (Unlike Game of Thrones), and the perfect ending to an amazing movie journey.",10,6,12,30 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I genuinely think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen
","I loved dicaprio and Pitt in the movie and the movie did have its funny moments and a couple of great acting moments. That being said, it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, wasn't thrilling enough to be a thriller, and wasn't enough plot points to be a drama. It was barely even a movie considering the fact that there was essentially no plot. It was also so long I'd rather watch a cheesy 5/10 rated comedy on Netflix. The fact that this was nominated for an Oscar just shows me that the oscars are rigged.",3,2,4,28 January 2020
Joker," One of the best movies I have ever seen
",This movie makes you think. It is a commentary on our world.,10,3,5,20 October 2019
Parasite," Greatest movie of 2019 EASILY!
",I watched this right after I was blown away by joker and didn't think anything that year could get better.,10,15,23,28 January 2020
Parasite," It's hands down one of my top five
",The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.,10,17,27,27 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Better than 1917
","This movie is one of the funniest movies of the year, one of the most heartfelt movies of the year, and one of the most thought-provoking movies of the year. It was way better than 1917.",9,2,4,16 February 2020
Looper," This movie really had me thinking.
","It's flawed with some obvious plot holes that naturally come with time travel movies but once you suspend your disbelief, this movie is a one of a kind gem.",8,0,2,4 February 2020
