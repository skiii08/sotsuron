Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious and Entertaining, both as satire and original humor
","From beginning to end, this movie rolls with the punches and every scene is played for comedy. Sacha is in top form and this movie is sure to be a staple in most DVD collections. Without spoiling the movie, the scene that serves as the climax (from a literary plot standpoint) had me laughing so hard that tears streamed down my face. I was bordering on releasing most of my other bodily functions as well.*weak spoiler ahead*The vague plot involves Borat being sent to America to learn American customs, but events soon after arriving lead him to trek cross-country in search of love. There is only one other person in this film besides Borat who you should recognize, but she doesn't appear until nearly the end of the film.*end of possible spoiler*This film will appeal to college students like myself, most definitely, though younger teenagers who find their way into the theatre will love it as well. This film is likely not for conservative viewers.",9,3,10,28 September 2006
