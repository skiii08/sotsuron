Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as good as the first three, but worth seeing
","Phantom Menace is a very entertaining movie with excellent special effects, but failed to live up to the expectations generated by the first three Star Wars films.In my opinion, the two things that caused the greatest harm to this movie were 1) Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker and 2) the character Jar Jar Binks. The first Harry Potter movie demonstrated that there are many very good child actors, so why couldn't George Lucas pick a good child actor to portray Anakin Skywalker?  The character Jar Jar Binks sounds like a Jamaican wannabe reject that may appeal to some children, but definitely has no adult appeal whatsoever.Though I was very disappointed to find out that the next Star Wars installment 'Attack of the Clones' includes Jar Jar Binks again, at least Jake Lloyd couldn't grow up fast enough to portray an older Anakin Skywalker.  Hopefully it will be a much better film than Phantom Menace.My advice:  see Phantom Menace, but do your best to ignore Jake Lloyd's poor acting and Jar Jar Binks' bad Jamaican accent.",7,0,1,21 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the best films of 2001
","My hat is off to the producers, writers, actors and everyone else that made Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring one of the best films of 2001! I can't wait to see The Two Towers & The Return of the King!My advice: don't miss this film on the big screen!  I will definitely get a copy when it comes out on DVD.",10,1,1,21 January 2002
Spider-Man," 'Spider-Man' Rocks!
","This is definitely one of the best superhero films I have seen! I was looking forward to seeing this film and I was not disappointed!The dialog, writing and plot flowed very well and remained true to the original Marvel Comics vision of Spiderman.  A lot of the special effects are computer generated, but that does not detract from the film. 
I highly recommend seeing this film!",10,0,0,3 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Overly-hyped, overly-long, whiney, sappy, melodramatic tripe
","A friend of mine and I watched this overly-long 3-hour flick two weeks ago on DVD.  Though the film has extravagant special effects, the characters and plot fail to live up to the massive hype that this film received when it was released.Ben Affleck's character and the love story with Kate Beckinsale was nearly identical with his character in Armageddon.  It's sad that he, the writers and producers of Pearl Harbor couldn't come up with something more original.After 2 hours of watching this film, I nearly fell asleep.  If the editors had cut most of the whiney, sappy & melodramatic tripe to have a 2-hour film, it would have been a much better, far more entertaining and much more exciting movie.My advice: if you want to see a good film about the attack on Pearl Harbor, watch the History Channel or rent the movie 'Tora! Tora! Tora!'.",1,1,2,21 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Very well done, very entertaining and fun to watch
","Though I have not read the Harry Potter books, I saw this film and found it to be truly entertaining and fun movie to see.Whether you are a child, a child at heart, or an adult that enjoys a good break from reality, it is very likely that you will enjoy watching this film.The child actors are excellent (why couldn't George Lucas find one good child actor for Phantom Menace?), as are the adult actors in this film. The plot is wonderful.My advice:  sit back, watch the film on a big screen, and enjoy yourself!",10,0,0,21 January 2002
Army of Darkness," Pure Nonsense & Utter Stupidity!
","I am truly amazed by the number of people that enjoyed this totally stupid movie.  Some friends wanted to see this movie when it was released in 1993, and, not realizing what I was getting myself into, went with them.  Had I not rode to the theater with one of my friends, I would have walked out of this celluloid disaster before it was half over!  (If only I had drove my own car to the theater that night!)This regurgitated 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' with a mixture of 'The Siege' mentality was a complete waste of time and money!I doubt that any of the actors in this totally forgettable flop use this on their resumes.",1,9,26,28 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," ONE OF THE GREATEST SCI-FI MOVIES OF ALL TIME!
","The original 'Star Wars' is, to this day, one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time!  When it was released in 1977, no other sci-fi film could come close in comparison to the quality and advancement in special effects technology that this movie presented.  'Star Wars' set the standard by which all other sci-fi films are judged to this day.As for the plot, many critics like to say that people continue to watch and enjoy 'Star Wars' to recapture lost youth.  They're wrong.  Because we remain young at heart and idealistic about the future, we love movies such as 'Star Wars' that promote the hope of a better tomorrow when so many other things in real life have failed.  Movies such as 'Star Wars' ignite the imagination and encourage mankind to reach for the stars!  Maybe it's the critics who need to recapture their youth and idealism, both of which appear to be dead and forgotten.My thanks to George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guiness and the many other cast and crew that brought this remarkable film to life for countless generations to enjoy!P.S.  George, when are you going to release the original trilogy on DVD?",10,0,0,29 January 2002
