Walk the Line," This Should Have Won Best Picture
","I've always said that Johnny Cash Is the only Country music worth listening to. The reason why is because Cash was heavy metal before heavy metal. Allow me to explain. Johnny Cash wrote and sang songs about killing people, doing drugs, and selling his soul. The guy was Ozzy before Ozzy. That's what made Cash so great. After seeing the very disappointing Ray (The acting was great, but even that didn't stop it from feeling like a made for TV movie on VH-1) I was a little nervous when I heard about the film on Johnny Cash, starring actors and actresses that annoy me. I can't stand Joaquin Phoenix or Reese Witherspoon. I did not hold high hopes for Walk The Line. Luckily I was proved wrong. Walk The Line was great, and it's a bio-film done right. It's the life story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) who has a hard live growing up in poverty stricken Arkansas, during the '20's and his life didn't get Any better after his brother dies in a horrible accident. Cash spends the rest of his life doing anything he can to make his father (Robert Patrick, Terminator 2, TV's The X-Files) love him. Cash doesn't find happiness till he plays music, but when that's not good enough for his father, or his wife that does nothing to support his love for music. It's not till he's on tour with Elvis Presley (The only flaw in the film, the man who plays Elvis looks or sounds nothing like Elvis)that he meets the woman who he feels is his soul mate June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Walk The Line is a great film, that is more than worth seeing. Witherspoon took home The Acadamy Award for Best Actress and Phoenix should have took home the award for Best Actor. The film itself should have won best picture but sadly that award went to the very over rated Crash. Walk The Line is also fun and at the same time touching and sad. The best scene in the film is the reenactment of the live performance at Folsom Prison where Cash recorded, against the advise of all management at his record label, his best selling album to date. Plus unlike most bio-flick's Walk The Line get's it right. No artsy scenes, or dumb dream sequences like in Ray. This is the story Of Johnny and June-carter Cash plain and simple. I highly recommend this as a rental, and I wish that I saw this film in the theater. It will end up in my DVD collection much, much, much sooner than later. Walk The Line joins films such as The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction. Films that got robbed in the best picture category. On a scale of 10 I give Walk The Line a 10. Yet another great film that should have took home the best picture award and lost to garbage. That's a shame.",10,0,0,19 April 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Awesome
","In 2003 Marvel teamed up with Universal pictures, to make what was supposed to be their third blockbuster franchise film, simply titled Hulk (X-Men and Spider-Man were the other two). They assigned Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) to direct and casted Eric Banna (Black Hawk Down), Jennifer Connoley (Blood Diamond), and Nick Nolte (48 Hours) to star in the film, as well as having 'state of the art CGI'. Needless to say everything on the surface looked great. Then the film was released, and instead of a monster hit, Universal and Marvel had a monster bomb. The franchise was considered dead, and all plans for a sequel were scrapped.Five years later Hulk fan Edward Norton goes to Marvel studios with a script he wrote along with Zak Penn. Marvel loved the script and gave it to universal and bam (or is that smash?) a new movie titled The Incredible Hulk gets the green light (no pun intended). Lee is replaced with Louis Letteier (Transporter) someone who knows about making action films), Banna is replaced with Norton, and Connoley is replaced with Liv Tyler (Lord Of The Rings, The Strangers).Needless to say The Incredible Hulk is awesome and is so much better than the very slow, artsy version that Ang Lee gave us. As a matter of fact my exact words to my wife as the credits started to roll was 'The 2003 version no longer exists in my eyes'.From the opening sequence, which reenacts the opening scene from the old television series, to the final scene The Incredible Hulk left me smiling. As a big fan of the old series and the comic book (which I still read to this day) I can honestly say this was done well and would entertain anybody that went to see it. There is so much action it's hard to pick a favorite scene, there's humor where there needs to be, and even a hint of romance in the air.The best thing that works in the film is the final fight scene between The Hulk and The Abomination (played by Tim Roth) which is everything a movie about two monsters fighting should be, unlike the lame, short, and very dark fight scene in the original.I know people that had suffered through the 2003 version were tempted to stay away for this film, but trust me the whole Batman Begins type recipe has wiped the slate clean and started fresh, and that is what makes this film a blast.As I have mentioned in many reviews for these type of movies, I am a comic book geek that loves his superhero movies. It took Hollywood four films to get batman (my favorite) right. Now It's The Hulk's turn. Looks like Batman is holding the door open to Hollywood for him.On a scale of 10 I give The Incredible Hulk a 10. Marvel is doing a great job making their own movies. First Iron Man, now this. It makes me very excited to see Thor and Captain America.",10,3,6,18 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," The Best In The Series
","There are 2 roads you can go down in Hollywood, when an action series reaches it's 3rd film. 1 road is release a great 1st film, and even better 2nd film, and a 3rd film that doesn't quite measure up to the 1st 2 films. Sadly this is the route that the Lethal Weapon series went. The 2nd road you can take is to release a great 1st film, a decent 2nd film and then a 3rd film that is the best in the series. This is the road that the Die Hard series went down, and I am happy to say that this is the road that Missin:Impossible went down. When Paramount released Mission:Impossible in the late '90's, which was directed by Brian DiPalma, fans were treated to a great spy thriller. However action buffs were complaining that there was not enough action and to much story. When Paramount released Mission:Impossible II in 2000, Asian action director John Woo (Faceoff, The Replacement Killers) was called in to helm the film. Now the roles were reversed and while action fans got their fix, there was a big complaint that there was not enough story. Now with Mission:Impossible III paramount has recruited J.J. Abrams, creator of TV's bizarre but brilliant LOST, and the acclaimed action, thriller, spy series ALIAS, to helm the film and the results are perfect. Abrams mixes great action and great story together that action fans, and thriller fans should be happy. Abrams should just stay on the series for Mission'Impossible IV (like there won't be one)because he was born to make great spy, action, thriller movies. Tom Cruise, who get's my vote for most annoying person in America, is 1 of the 2 things that make this film work. Cruise's Ethan Hunt, is a good guy that you actually want to route for. It seems to me that in most action films the bad guy's are 10 times cooler than the good guys. The 2nd thing that makes this film work is Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the villain. Hoffman is the villain you love to hate, and that's something that is usually overlooked in action films. Soem might call M:I III ALIAS: The Movie. I hope that people who have never seen ALIAS & Like what they see with M:I III will give ALIAS a shot on DVD. Here's to hoping that Abrams sticks around for M:I 4. On a scale of 10 I give Missin:Impossible III an 8.",8,1,1,5 June 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Good, But Not As Good As Black Pearl
","I remember when I first saw the poster for Pirates Of The Caribbean : The curse Of The Black Pearl I laughed. I was wondering how desperate was Disney for a hit? Then I saw trailers for it and I thought to myself, Hmm That doesn't look so bad. After hearing the rave reviews from fans and critic's alike I gave in and saw it. i walked away loving every minute of that film and did not want it to end. I did not make the same mistake beating around the bush and saw Pirates Of The Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest on opening night. While I really enjoyed this film I walked away liking the original more. Don't get me wrong there's plenty of action and the CGI was amazing, and of course Johnny Depp was brilliant but the original just had a better story line that's all. The begging of DMC starts off a little slow, however this is for character development, which is usually overlooked in Hollywood. The Crown of England is not to happy with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Kierra Knightly) for helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape at the end of the original. The payment for the crime is death. Now Will Turner, to save Elizabeth's life must return with The compass of Jack Sparrow or his bride to be will die. Jack on the other hand is up to his neck in debt and his life is on the line again, this time with the evil Davey Jones, who looks incredible with all the make up they put on the actor. The only way for Jack to be truly free is for him to find the 'Dead Man's Chest' and stab the contents of the chest to kill Jones (That would be Jones's heart). However Jack is not going to surrender the compass to find the chest so easily to Turner, and he doesn't care that Ms. Swan's life is in trouble. In the meantime the only way Jones has said that Jack can get out of debt is for him to gather 100 souls for Jones and thus the rat race begins. Depp, who is one of the best character actor I've ever seen (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Ichabod Crane, Willy Wonka, and Donnie Brasco) is once again brilliant and hopefully will be nominated again for best actor for the role (he lost to Sean Penn for Mystic River). I do believe that Depp will be an Acadamy Award winner some day. As for Bloom and Kinghtly they pick up right where they left off. I think the thing that kind of bummed me out the most about Pirates 2 was the ending. While I won't give it away, let's just say that it's becoming more and more of a gimmick in Hollywood nowadays's to have the type of ending that Pirates 2 had. I think the thing that was so great about the original was that it was a sleeper hit. No one thought it would do well and it took the box office by storm. I'm not saying I didn't like Pirates 2, I thought it was great and also didn't want it to end. I just enjoyed the original more that's all. On a scale of 10 I give Pirates Of The Caribbean : Dead man's Chest an 8. With plenty of action, great effects, and plenty of laughs it a great film, just not as good as the original.",8,4,8,11 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," To Sum This Film Up In One Word.....Awesome!!!!!
","The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is awesome! This movie is one of the ten best of 2005, plain and simple. Don't believe me? See it for yourself. This film caters to not only fans of fantasy but just to fans who love good film making as well. It has a great story, good acting and mind blowing CGI. Directed by Andrew Adomson (Shrek and Shrek 2) The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is actually the second part in a seven part series of novels the tell the story of four kids Lucy (Georgie Henly, Edmund (Skandar Adama), Peter (William Mosley), and Susan (Anna Poppelwell) who enter the world of Narnia, a world that's beautiful, magical, strange, mysterious, and scary all at once. There have been several adaptations of C.S. Lewis's beloved novel, the best known (till now that is) is the animated two hour made for TV film from the '70's. The plot is still the same as the novel. The four children, living in war torn Englad at the beginning of World War II are sent to live, as evacuees after their home is bombed by Germany, with a professor in his mansion. The problem is there are rules such as no touching things, no running, etc. etc. Basically no having fun. One day during a rainy day, the kids being kids break the rules and play hide and seek. Little Lucy finds a wardrobe that she decides to hide in, what she doesn't know is that the wardrobe is the gateway to the world of Narnia. Lucy manages to get her brothers and sister to come back with her and the four are then, unknowing to them, are caught up in the middle of a war between good and evil. Narnia is a land that has been cursed by The White Witch (Tilda Swinton, who seemed like she was channeling Emperor Plapatine from Return Of The Jedi and Revenge Of The Sith. The witch has made it winter for 100 years with no sign of having it stop. Them she meets Edmund, and she realizes that the prophecy of Narnia is true. The prophecy says that four humans will come to Narnia and aid Aslan, the true king of Narnia, in defeating the witch. This makes her panic. Soon The children meet Aslan, The Lion (voiced perfectly by Liam Neeson) and the war between good and evil begins. Narnia is great and Disney has what should be a pretty successful franchise on their hands. Adomason, who does such a good job with this film has signed on to do two more. Disney has announced that they will not be adapting all seven books but just three, all that has been announced was parts two and seven (The Final Battle). Now fans of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy that have this series pegged as the nest LOTR might be a little disappointed. Narnia plays more like a Harry Potter film than a LOTR film (This isn't bad thing by the way). The CGI is great, not LOTR great but then again it's not The Hulk either. The other thing that makes this a good movie (other than the CGI) is the acting. Usually i hate kid actors. I mean Jake Loyd was half the reason The Phantom Menace sucked, and while he wowed me in The Sixth Sense Haley Joel Osmet hasn't done anything to impress me since (A,.I.? come on). These kids are great as great as the kids from the Harry Potter films. Just like them these kids have studied the roles very well. Now for parents thinking this should be a 100% kid friendly film because it's under the Disney banner and rated PG, think again. The final battle is pretty damn violent and the meeting between Aslan and The Witch is very disturbing and could frighten young children, it's also a very sad scene. Like I'm sure most people do I ignored all the Christian references and just enjoyed the film as it was, a great movie. On a scale of 10 I give The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe a 10. One of the best films of the year.",10,0,2,3 January 2006
Spider-Man 3," As Good As The Original, Not as Good As 2
","I was worried about Spider-Man 3. It looked as though the series might have taken a wrong turn and start heading down the path as the old Batman Series did after Batman Returns. It looked as though to much might have been crammed into this film, with to little amount of time. There is the Goblin story, plus the Sandman, and the story everyone has been waiting for, Venom.I can honestly say I was mistaken, and seeing as my expectations were so low, Spider-man 3 actually pleasantly surprised me. If this truly is the last film, which rumors are flying that it might be, but we know how that works, then Spider-man 3 has a nice wrap up story. In Star Wars terms, Spider-man 3 is the series Return Of The Jedi, while Spider-Man 2 is the Empire Strikes Back.taking place a few years after Spider-man 2, Peter parker (Tobey Mcguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are madly in love. M.J. is now in a Broadway musical, and it seems that the people of New York are ignoring The Daily Bugle and coming to love and appreciate Spider-Man for the hero that he is.Enter Flint Marko, and escapade convict, who come to find out is the real person who killed Peter's uncle Ben. While Flint (Thomas Hayden Church) is on the run he enters a molecular testing site and becomes 'living' sand due to an accident. Turns out Marko is a crook with a 'heart' and only commits his crimes to get money to cure his daughters disease, which is never explained.Then comes Harry Osbourne (James Franco, son of Norman the original Green Goblin, who wants Peter dead for Spider-man killing his father, a death that was a mishap on Norman's part, that Harry does not know about. Harry tries to get at Peter through messing with his head. The Harry Osbourne story in my opinion was the weakest sub-plot in Spider-Man 3.Then along comes the character every Spider-Man fan has been waiting for Venom. While making out with Mary Jane in a giant web, he misses a comet fall to earth (I'd still like to know how that happens) and from the comet comes the black ooze that bonds to peter and makes him more darker and evil (almost like the awful Superman III). The new 'black' costume, made up of this ooze gives Peter enhanced strength, however he finds himself inching closer to 'the dark side' like Luke in Jedi.Spider-Man 3 makes up something that has been rarely seen in Hollywood since the original Star Wars trilogy, a good trilogy. Now a lot of comic book die hards will complain about the continuity issue with the Sandman being uncle Ben's real killer, but I was able to over look that. My big complaints about the film was an over the top song and dance number and I wish Venom spoke like he speaks in the comic, calling himself 'we' and 'us'.Regardless Spiser-man 3 was fun. That's something I'm glad Hollywood has got back into making. Movies that are fun, you just check your brain at the door, and get lost in the film. That's what was great about the other 2 Spider-Man films. Spidr-man 3 is a good ending, there is no need for Spider-man 4, but then again this is Hollywood.",8,0,0,10 May 2007
Silent Hill," Not To Bad, But not Good Either
","When you make a movie out of a video game you get mixed results. If the movie is done right, you get a decent film like Laura Croft: Tomb Raider. If it's not done right you get Resident Evil or House Of The Dead. Where does Silent Hill fall? strangely enough, right in between. I love the game Silent Hill. When I heard that a movie was being made out of it, I didn't know what to think. The plot for the game is great, just like Resident Evil and as mentioned R.E. was terrible. A friend of mine got us passes to see this film (Thank You Joe) and I was accompanied by my wife (who also loved the game), my friend and his wife. When we left I can say That my friend wasn't sure what to make of it, his wife hated it and my wife though it was okay. Silent Hill is the story of a little girl named Sharyn who keeps having hallucinations that bring her (spiritually, I think) into a demonic possessed world. When her mother Rose decides to get her daughter some help, against the will of her husband Chris, Rose brings Sharyn to the place she keeps seeing in her vision/dreams Silent Hill. S.H. is a town that has a reputation of being a mysterious ghost town. Now when Sharyn and Rose get to S.H. that's when 'The Darkness' comes and all kinds of strange zombie looking things start attacking Rose who has lost Sharyn and is fighting off these monsters to find her daughter. Silent Hill held my interest and had a great mixture of CGI and latex costumes (something that is a rarity in movies now a day's). However it's when the film hits it's big climatic ending that leaves you scratching your head. When 'The Evil Reaper', who comes in the form of Sharyn starts explaining what is going on to Rose I became confused and I could hear audience members becoming just as confused and one person behind me asking what was going on for like the 50th time, and asking her boyfriend if they could leave yet. I know die hard fans of the game, tat also saw this film and they were just as confused. Plus there has always been an unwritten rule in Hollywood that horror flicks should not go over 90 minutes. Silent Hill goes on for 2 hours and 11 minutes. Overkill. Silent Hill could have been a great horror film in the same vein as Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, and other great zombie flicks. Sadly with a confusing ending it comes off as more a George A. Romero rip off, and your confusion turns into complete frustration. While Silent Hill is better than Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat, it's not nearly as good as the Tomb Raider movies. Don't get me wrong those films won't earn Acadamy Award winner Angelina Jolie any more awards, at least they were entertaining, and didn't confuse or aggravate you. On a scale of 10 I give Silent Hill a 5. Better than most video game movies, but not nearly as good as the few that have earned the right to be called good.",5,0,3,27 April 2006
Corpse Bride," Another Animated Classic From Tim Burton
","Tim Burton is a genius at animation. While all major studio's such as Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks thrive on computer generated animation Tim Burton goes back to a style that Hollywood has forgotten about. Stop Motion. Stop motion animation is great. I grew up as a child watching ninety percent of Christmas specials being filmed in stop motion. The first stop motion film I ever saw on the big screen was Tim Burton's The Nightmare before Christmas. I remember being blown away by it. Years later Tim Burton (The director responsible for Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow, Planet Of The Apes, Big Fish, and this summers hit Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remake) decides to make another animated film and Burton fans rejoiced. Corpse Bride is very similar to Nightmare with the animation as well as the songs. Yes it is a musical, although Burton doesn't go overboard the way Disney used to in making eighty percent of the film all song and dance. Corpse Bride has about five songs in it that are all about the afterlife. The plot is interesting. Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp, making this 5 Burton films he's been in now) is arranged to marry Victoria Everglot (voiced by Emily Watson). The two fall in love after they meet at their dinner rehearsal. The Van Dort's are rich beyond people's wildest imagination. The Everglot's however are broke and are arranging their daughter Victoria to marry Victor so her parents Maudeline Everglot (Joanna Lumley) and Finnis Everglot (Albert Finney) can get their hands on The Van Dort fortune. Victor is a bumbling idiot who is so nervous at their wedding rehearsal that he can't get his vows right. This angers the minister (voiced by the legend Christopher Lee)and he calls off their rehearsal. Victor so upset, goes for a stroll in the woods and places his wedding ring for his bride on a tree limb as he practices his vows. The problem was it was no tree branch but a finger of a rotted corpse that was sticking out of the ground. Enter Emily (voiced by Helena Bonham-Carter, Burton's real life bride to be)who falls in love with Victor at first sight. Now that Emily has the ring on her finger she is considered to be the wife of Victor. There is only one problem. Victor is alive and well, while Emily is dead. Victor is dragged to the underworld where people are having the time of their lives, always having one hell of a party in the taverns, while in the world of the living things are dreary and depressing. Victor longs to get back to his bride to be, Victoria however Emily will stop at nothing to stay married. Corpse Bride is a fun movie that is typical Tim Burton. The man knows eye candy like no other director. He has the best looking sets in all of Hollywood right now. If you don't believe me just watch Beetlejuice, Sleepy Hollow, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, or his first animated classic The Nightmare Before Christmas. Corpse Bride ranks up there with those films. As I said before the world of the living in the film is dark and depressing. It's literally shown in shades of gray, while the world of the dead is all happy go lucky. Everything is all bright and it's one big party. That's Tim Burton for you. Burton has created another Halloween classic, like Nightmare that will surely develop a cult following just like Nightmare. After ten years that film is considered an animated classic and most likely will continue it's reign. Corpse Bride will definitely follow in it's footsteps. Granted I am biased about Burton. I've loved all his films including his Planet Of The Apes remake (yes I'm the one). Corpse Bride is a great film that is fun from beginning to end. If you're in the mood for a good Halloween themed film then I highly recommend it. If not, then their is plenty of great slasher flicks out there for you to watch again and again till you fall asleep. On a scale of 10 I give Tim Burton's Corpse Bride an 8. Again a great time at the movies.",8,0,1,11 October 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," Finally!! A Comedy Nominated For Best Picture, That's Actually Funny
","Usually comedies that get the best picture nod are not that good. The Full Monty was not funny, and Four Wedding & A Funeral was even worse. However there was something about Little Miss Sunshine that made me want to go to my local video store and rent it. Maybe it was because Steve Carell was in it? I don't know. Regardless I am happy to say that I am glad I rented this and I would have payed full price to see this movie.In the film we meet the Hoover's. There's father Richard (Greg Kinnear) who is trying to get his 'nine step' self motivation program off the ground, and finding little to no success. Then there is mother Sheryl (Toni Collette) who is the sole bread earner in the family and not doing well. Then there's uncle Frank (Steve Carell) who is a genius, but has failed at trying to commit suicide because he was dumped by his lover. There also Dwayne (Paul Dano) who has taken a vow of silence till he can get into the air force. There's also Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a foul mouthed, heroine snorting old man, who has been kicked out of his old age home because of his drug addiction. Last but not least is Olive (Abigail Breslin) the youngest of the family who has dreams of becoming Miss America some day.Needless to say the Hoover's are an extremely dysfunctional family who can not see eye to eye. Then Olive gets a phone call that tells her she has been invited to compete is The Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant, and the dysfunctional family piles into their broken down old Volks Wagon hippie van, to get Olive to Califirnia to make her dream of competing come true.Now some critics will try and use big words to explain how this movie is an artful masterpiece, but the truth is, L.M.S. is nothing more than a road trip movie that is a dry humor fest. Soem people might watch this and not understand why people find it so funny because there is no over acting (Jim Carrey anyone?) or any over the top zaniness going on. L.M.S. is more in the same place as The Ice Harvest, or The Princess Bride, and that's what makes this film work.Greg Kinnear gives a great performance, and proves that he should be in every dry comedy ever made. Toni Collette adds another good flick to her resume (Mariel's Wedding, The Sixth Sense) and proves she will win an Oscar some day. Steve Carell proves why he is the best comedic actor since John Cusak in Hollywood today, and can play perfect roles in zany comedies such as The 40 Year Old Virgin (My personal favorite comedy)and has a great dry sense of humor for a film like this. After seeing him in this film, my expectations for Evan Allmighty have grown even higher. Paul Dano, even though he does not speak brings some great laughs to the screen, and Abigail Breslin will become the kid star that Haley Joel Osmet was supposed to be.The best thing about Little Miss Sunshine though is Alan Arkin, who won an Oscar for his role as the foul mouthed, drug addicted grandfather. He steals every scene he's in, and had me holding my sides. I've always felt this man was funny especially in The In-Laws (along with Peter Faulk) and Gresse Pointe Blank. He is finally getting the attention he deserves.If you are in the mood for something different, or just love a good dry comedy like I do, then go to the video store and rent Little Miss Sunshine. It's worth it.",10,1,3,5 March 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The Funniest Movie I've ever seen
","For many years The film American Pie was my favorite comedy of all time. then a few weeks ago I saw Wedding Crashers, and American Pie was having some serious competition. then just two weeks later both American Pie and Wedding Crashers was dethroned by the new reigning champ The 40 Year Old Virgin. Holy crap is this movie funny as hell. in the first two minutes I was laughing my ass off. I was skeptical on this movie at first because everyone I knew that saw this movie was telling me how funny it was and how much I'd love it. I was weary because everyone told me the same thing about Napolean Dynamite and Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgandy. words can not describe how much I hated those movies. So I figured what the hell I'll give The 40 Year Old Virgin a shot. I'm glad I did. The story is simple, Andy (Steve Carell, who also wrote the movie) works at a store called Smart Tech (It's supposed to be Circuit City/Besy Buy) with David (Paul Rudd) Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) who he becomes friends with. Then they find out the shocking news that Andy is a virgin at 40 years old. Now David, Jay, and Cal have one goal in life, get Andy Laid. Andy is more content with sitting at home playing his video games, reading his comic books (this angle aggravates me because it make people like me look like jackasses) and collecting his action figures. Even Andy's elderly neighbors who he watches Survivor with every Thursday knows Andy needs to get some. Andy doesn't even have a car, he rides a bike to and from work. After failed attempt after attempt from his friends Andy meets Trish (Katherine Keener) and realizes that she could be the one. The problem is Andy doesn't want to tell her he's a virgin because he's very embarrassed about it. The 40 Year Old Virgin is rated R for a reason. Like Wedding Crashers there are a ton of swears and I haven't seen more jokes about sexual content since Porky's. This movie is HYSTERICAL! I was laughing pretty much from the minute it started to the minute it ended. It's not for everybody though. The movie relies heavily on jokes about sexual content and sexual references, plus some people might be turned off by the swearing. especially in the scene where Andy's friends decide he needs a good waxing because he's to damn hairy. Personally I thought this was the film's second funniest scene. If stuff like this offends you then wait for rental because you won't spend as much as going to the theater and you can turn it off any time you want. If this stuff doesn't offend you then by all means see this movie. This movie is in my top 5 films of the year list at number 2. Batman Begins comes in at number 1. On a scale of 10 I give The 40 Year Old Virgin a 10. As I said before it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. Long live the king.",10,1,4,21 September 2005
Batman Begins," Finally Batman has been done right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Almost ten years ago Warner Bros. declared the Batman franchise as dead as a teenager in a Friday The 13th film. After the abomination that was Batman & Robin WB felt as though fans would not be interested in seeing another Joel Shumacher helmed Batman film. WB was right. fast forward a few years and Director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) & screenwriter David Goyer (The Blade trilogy) decide they have what it takes to resurrect the Batman franchise. Nolan & Goyer were right. Batman Begins is by far the best live action Batman film made. Nolan & Goyer did the best thing they could do to a franchise that was on it's way to looking like a live action Saturday morning cartoon. They wiped the slate clean and started it from the ground up, hence the title Batman Begins. Unlike the film predecessors Batman Begins stars and features Batman. Meaning Batman is the main character (He was only the main character in Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm an animated Batman movie)instead of his villains. Batman should have been titles The Joker. Batman Returns should have been called The Adventures Of Catwoman & The Penguin. Batman Forever should have been titled The Mental Misadventures Of The Riddler & Two Face. Batman & Robin should have been called.....Crap! The Movie. Batman Begins is the perfect title for a Batman movie because this movie is absolute Batman. The plot is smart & intelligent and his origin is entertaining as hell to watch unfold. Whoever casted Christian Bale as Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, & Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon please stand up and take a bow. The casting was great. If I had to compare Batman Begins to any film I'd say it was like a cross between Spider-Man & The Bourne Identity. A great origin superhero movie mixed with a thinking man's action film. This is not dumbed down like any of those other Batman films (Batman Forever, Batman & Robin) it's smart, witty, & intelligent with out taking itself to seriously. I'm a comic book geek so I take my films based on comics very seriously. Until now Batman was never done right in Hollywood. For some stupid reason Hollywood kept trying like hell to channel the spirit of the goofy, campy television series of the '60's. Well that recipe has been tossed out the window. Not only is Batman Begins (In my opinion) the best movie of the summer, the most fun you'll have at the movies this summer, but the best superhero movie (granted he has no super powers) made. I only hope I walk out of The Fantastic 4 nearly as happy as I did with Batman Begins. Long live the new king of superhero/comic book movies. Welcome to Hollywood Batman, you have finally arrived. On a scale of 10 i give Batman Begins a 10 out of 10. Do not wait for video if you do you'll regret it.",10,10,18,16 June 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Better Than The Original, Not as good as 2
","I have to admit I was skeptical on X-Men 3. I mean since the beginning I've heard how Bryan Singer (The director of X-Men, and the even better X-Men 2) left the film to go and direct Superman Returns. His original plan was to come back and direct the third (and final?) X-Men film. Marvel Pictures wasn't to thrilled with Singer going off to direct a film about a DC Comics character so they fired Singer and replaced him with Bret Ratner of the Rush Hour films & Red Dragon. Now don't get me wrong the Rush Hour films are good action/comedies and Red Dragon is everything that the terrible Hannibal should have been, but does Ratner have what it takes for an X-Men film? the answer is yes...and no. As a long time fan of the comic book I found myself telling me that I had to keep the comic as far from my head as possible. Which after I did I found X-Men 3 to be a decent action film and a good trilogy as a whole. Needless to say X-Men 3 doesn't fall into the same category as Superman III or Alien 3 (2 films that came after great sequels) but it's no Return Of The Jedi either. The plot get's complicated as the script tries to combine 2 story lines, the first (and the 1 that takes center stage) is the mutant cure story line, in which a lab creates a cure for the mutant gene. The second is one of the most complicated stories from the comic, The Dark Phoenix Saga, which aggravated me that it was a side story. Clocking in at a little over 90 minutes, X-Men 3 felt rushed to get finished, while X-Men 2 was a whopping 2 1/2 hours and told a great story. The bright spots of the third chapter was the new mutants such as Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and the man that stole the show Beast (Kelsey Grammar, who I usually can not stand, yes that Frasier in a ton of make up to make him look Blue & Furry). However there was not nearly enough character development for either of these characters, not like they did with Nightcrawler in X-Men 2. Ian McKellan shines once again as Magneto the X-men's big villain, and just like the fist 2 films X-Men 3 turns into the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) show. The thing that really made me mad was Halle Berry whined and cried to get more screen time as Storm and still does nothing for the film. As mentioned before if you are a fan of the comic, as I am, then just keep that out of your head for a good 90+ minutes and you'll be fine. X-men 3 is a good ending to the trilogy (as it stands there is no X-Men 4 planned but a Wolverine film planned). Let's just hope it doesn't go the route of Alein 4 after fans of the comic call for Ratner's head. On a scale of 10 I give X-Men 3 an 8.",8,0,2,31 May 2006
Transformers," This Film Will Bring The Inner 10 Year Old Out In You.
","I grew up loving Transformers. The only thing I loved more than Transformers was Star Wars. I watched the TV show religiously, had all the toys, and read the comic book. Sadly that legacy ended for me in 1986 when the animated movie hit theaters and my favorite character's like Optimus Prime, Megatrom, and Starscream were killed off in the first 20 minutes of the film to make room for new characters like Cup, RC, Galvatron, Blur, Hot Rod, and Ultra Magnus. In General Transformers was ruined.Fast forward 20 some odd years later and director Michael Bay has brought the war bound alien robots to life in a live action movie with producer Steven Spielberg in tow. Bay has been blasted and praised for his films, which include The Rock, Armageddon, Bad Boys, Bad Boys II, Pearl harbor, Miami Vice, and very underrated The Island. Some people feel Bay has what it takes to make a big budget summer popcorn action flick, while others feel he cators to much to the younger crowd that don't care about strong plots. Personally I like Bay, most of the time. I enjoyed The Island, The Rock, both Bad Boys films, and Armageddon. Pearl Harbor, and Miami Vice I want to know what he was smoking. So the question is, did Bay get back to the typical leave your brain at the door, and just have a good time type of movie? The answer is...Yes.Transformers is a blast, and is one of the better films of the disappointing summer 2007 season. Spider-Man 3, and Knocked up are also high on my list. It's an action film that not afraid to be an action film. The thing that makes me extremely happy is that the movie catered to all the older fans that grew up watching the old cartoon (although I better see Soundwave in the sequel).The plot is paper thin and easy. 2 races of alien robots, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and The Decepticon's led by Megatron, destroy their home world of Cybertron. They then bring their war to Earth and the human race is caught in the middle. The Decepticons want to wipe out all Humans to make earth the new Cybertron, while the auto-bots want to protect us.That's the story of Transformers, plain and simple, the end. You can't help but get giddy when you hear Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, who voiced him back in the old cartoon) say 'Autobots, roll out'.Fans who grew up watching the cartoon will not be disappointed, although I still wish Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) was a gun of some sorts, the film was 2 1/2 hours of robots beating the hell out of each other and stuff blowing up. People who never watched the old cartoon and just think the movie looks good shouldn't be disappointed either.This film has already been declared a hit and looks like it could dethrone Spider-Man 3 as the highest grossing film of the summer. As much as I love Spider-Man I have to admit, I hope it does. It came to no shock when I heard that Transformers 2 is already being written, and that old cartoons are the new stomping grounds for Hollywood.G.I. Joe, Masters Of The Universe, and Thundercats films are already in the works. All is can ask is where are the films based off Voltron, Battle Of The Planets, and Thundar The Barbarian?",8,1,5,9 July 2007
Saw II," Oh Yes There Is Blood...Lot's and Lots of Blood
","Saw II is not a movie for everyone. I mean you have to really like horror films to enjoy this flick. Hell even die hard horror fans might not like it because unlike the usual low budget horror films with a deformed man under a mask who doesn't speak at all, moves at a snail's pace and still manages to catch up to his victims, Saw II is a thinking man's horror film and I know horror fans hate to think. Saw II is a rarity. It's a sequel that is not better than the original but damn good. i think what makes these films so good is the originality in the serial killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). Jigsaw isn't a larger than life superhuman deformed man behind a mask. He's a cancer patient that kidnaps his victims and plays games with them. Unlike Jason Voorhees, Freddy Kruger, Michael Myers, Leatherface and Pinhead Jigsaw gives his victims a chance at survival, although it's a slimmer than slim chance. Jigsaw picks the scum of society for his victims. Drug dealers, drug addicts, hookers, etc., etc. basically people that society wouldn't miss. These are people that have done wrong in life and Jigsaw wants to show them the error of their ways. Of course this doesn't mean that what he does is justified, it's just what makes him different. Unlike the first film which had two victims Saw II has five kidnappee's all locked in an abandoned house. One of the victims is a kid named Daniel (Eric Knudsen) who is the son of police detective Eric Matthews (Cambridge's own Donnie Wahalberg, yes the same Wahlberg who is the older brother of Mark and danced on stage as a member of New Kids On The Block). Now Det. Matthews has two hours to save his son who has been notified via a cassette player, as all Jigsaw's victims, that the captives have been breathing in a deadly nerve toxin. However somewhere in the house they are being held in is the antidote. If they can find the antidote they will be alive when the doors open in three hours. if they can't they'll all be dead in two. Now Det. Matthews has to work one on one with Jigsaw or he never see's his delinquent son alive again. Saw II is creepy on a level unlike most slasher films, it could happen. There is a ton of sick people in this world and if someone like this Jigsaw guy exits I'm glad I don't know about it. Saw II like the first one had a twist I never saw coming, which is what I like about it. The victims are your typical victims. There's the sensible one Jonas (Glenn Plummer), the innocent one Laura (Beverly Mitchell), the annoying one Addison (Emmanuelle Vaugier), the expert Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the jerk who you can't wait to see bumped off Xavier (Fraky G, I hate when actors use dumb names like that) plus the Detective's son Daniel. However the typical horror victims aside Saw II is great. If you like horror films and are begging for something different, something the genre has only done with House Of 1,000 Corpses, The Devils Rejects, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (yes I thought the remake blew the original away, I mean how is the original so scary when you can't even see it because there is no lighting people!!!)then I highly recommend Saw II. If you haven't seen Saw then rent it first. Like the first one Saw II is the perfect hybrid of A Nightmare On Elm Street and Silence Of The Lambs. As I said before this film is not for everyone. It is graphically violent. After all what would you expect from a film that's tag line is 'Oh Yes, There Will Be Blood' and has a poster that has two rotted fingers that make the roman numeral for II. On a scale of ten I give Saw II an 8. The original gets a 10. I saw this film with my wife and best friend and both my friend and I loved it while my wife didn't care for it. So there's two opinions in one review.",8,0,1,7 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," One Of Tim Burton's Best Films!!!!!
","Charlie And The Chocolate Factory will be labeled and looked at as (what most movie fans fear) a remake. However it's not. It's not even close to the original which starred Gene Wilder and is one of my top 100 favorite films of all time. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was so far off form the book which was written by Rohl Dahl that Dahl (Who was rumored to detest the original) refused to sign off for a sequel. If Dahl was alive today he would have been very happy with Burton's version. It is practically word for word, scene for scene just like the book of the same name. The plot is simple. Willy Wonka is a candy god. The world worships him. Then for reasons which I will not explain because that would spoil the movie for you he closes his candy factory forever. Then out of the clear blue he decides that he is not only going to open the doors again but he is going to allow five lucky children to tour his factory, something that has never been allowed before. He runs this contest by putting five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The five lucky kids are Augustis Gloop a heavy kid from Germany who lives, breathes, and sleeps for chocolate. Tehn we have Violet Borogard. A little girl from Atlanta Georgia who's motto is winning is everything. She hates finishing any place but the top. Then we have Veruca Salt. A spoiled little rich girl from Birmingham, England. She has a father who's opinion on the world is money can buy everything. There's also Mike Tevee who's life revolves video games. He's a snot nosed punk who will stop at nothing to insult, cut down, or humiliate anyone in his path. Then finally we have Charlie Bucket. A bright little boy who has the heart of gold. He lives in a shack with his parents and his four grandparents. They barely have any money to put food on the table. Charlie is extremely tight with his Grandpa Joe. Who fascinates Charlie with his stories of Willy Wonka. Charlie is the one child who wants this prize more than anybody and deserves it because unlike all the other spoiled brats in the film Charlie is a working class blue collar kid who you just can't help but feel bad for. After the tickets are found the children meet the man who is their hero. Willy Wonka himself played by Tin Burton alumni Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, and the upcoming animated Burton film The Corpse Bride)who holds his own as Mr. Wonka. Milly is nothing what these kids think he's going to be. He's rude, brash, and a complete wise ass. In one scene when Violet throws her arms around him and says 'I'm Violet Borogard' Wonka looks down at her with an uncomfortable expression and replies 'I don't care'. The chocolate factory is a child's imagination come to life and no one has an eye for eye candy the way Tim Burton does. If you've never seen a Burton film then check out Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, or The Nightmare Before Christmas and you'll see what I mean. This movie has restored my faith in Burton when 'remaking' a classic (although as i said before this film is not a remake) but I'm a Burton junkie and have loved all his movies, yes even Planet of the Apes (yes I'm the one). After the debacle that was Planet Of The Apes (2000) it looked like Burton's career was over. The movie was a bomb and loathed by most fans that saw it basically giving a lot of heat about the ending (although P.O.T.A. has a better ending than the recent War Of The Worlds remake I've been told)but Burton bounced back with the masterpiece Big Fish. He hasn't dropped the ball since. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is one of Tim Burton's best films and has great eye candy as well as laugh's with Depp's Wonka and the Oompa Loompa's (all played by one man who's been CGI'd to make millions of Oompa Loompa's) and the songs in the films are funny as hell. As for Depp, he hold's his own as Willy Wonka. Believe me he has some big shoes to fill from Gene Wilder's Wonka. However as I said before this movie is so different from the original it falls into the apples and oranges category. It's hard to compare which one is better. The original is still a great film that I will always love. Burton's version ranks right up there with it. Burton's version is almost scene for scene, word for word just like the book. The original is not even close. Which is why I can't even compare the two as well as tell you who was the better Willy Wonka. Again apples and oranges. If you want a good time at the movies where you can just leave your brain at the door and get lost in a weird, wonderful world then i highly recommend Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Burton fans will love it. It ranks up there with Sleepy Hollow, Mars Attacks, Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, and Big Fish. Even people that have never seen a Burton film (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetle Juice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow, Planet Of The Apes, Big Fish and the upcoming Corpse Bride) will have a tough time not enjoying Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. It's a great time at the movies. Heck you'll find yourself wanting to go by candy as soon as the credits begin to roll. On a scale of 10 I give Charlie And The Chocolate Factory a 10. Go and enjoy. You won't regret it.",10,4,10,25 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," For A Film Based On A Terrible Book...Not Bad
","I've read the first 3 Harry Potter books. I usually see the movies first then read the books, otherwise I'll just nit pick the movies to death. Just ask anyone that was lucky enough to see any movie based on a comic book with me. My wife on the other hand is a Potter fanatic, and has read all 6 novels and is waiting with bated breath for the 7th and final book to come out.I was nervous going into this film for a few reasons. The first being that the Potter films have done something most franchises don't usually do, they pulled off 4 great movies in a row. It was only a matter of time before they hit a speed bump. The second reason was I have yet to meet anybody that has read Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix (the 5th book and film in the series) and has had anything good to say about it. Then again most people I know have had Luke warm things to say about the 4th book (Goblet Of Fire) and that turned out to be my favorite of the film series. So was Order Of The Phoenix any good, seeing it was based on what is considered by die hard Potter fans to be a horrible book? Was it better than the last film?The answer is surprisingly yes...and no. Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix is a good movie for a film based on a bad book, but however it's not as good as the last film (Goblet Of Fire) and the 3rd film (The Prisoner Of Azkaban) however it is better than the 1st film (The Scorceror's Stone. It's as good as the 2nd film (The Chamber Of Secrets) and that's not something to be ashamed of at all.Like the 1st 4 films Order Of The Phoenix starts out with harry at the Dursley's. His Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and cousin Dudly still hate him and treat him like stuff you'd send down a toilet (actually i think that stuff might be treated batter). He is still troubled by the events in the last film that saw the return of the evil Lord Voldemort, and the murder of Cedric Diggery. He longs for a return to Hogwarts, but sadly realizes that this year at the School Of Witchcraft And Wizardry might not be a good one. The Ministry Of Magic has the people of the magic world convinced that Harry is a liar, as well as Dumbledore, and that Lord Voldemort has not returned, and this is just a cover up to the 'mysterious' death of Diggery, and just a evil scheme for Dumbledore to try and take Cornelious Fudge's job as the Minister Of Magic.The lies that have been printed in The Daily Prophet (The New York Times of the magic world) has turned some of Harry's good friends, like Shamus Finnigan, against him and most people believe that he has in fact gone crazy. The Ministry has also launched a full scale investigation into Hogwarts turning the school into more like a prison. In the meantime Voldemort is starting to gather an army, so Harry does the same to try and stop him, leading the School into sort of a civil war.Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix is a very dark film, and would most likely produce the most scares for small children. Voldemort is still creepy looking as ever and the film has produced the best villain of all 5, in Delores Umbridge (Think Nure Ratchett in pink). It was also nice to see Gary Oldman return as Sirius Black, as well as returning characters 'Madeye' Moody and R.J. Lupin. Plus once again Jason Isaacs proves why he should play every villain in every movie.This latest installment sets up for what should be great final 2 movies, and has me eagerly awaiting the next film, Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince, a book which I have yet to hear anything bad about. Then again this is Hollywood, and leave it to them to make a great film based on a bad book, and a bad film based on a great book. For those of you who don't understand what I mean I've got three words for you...The Phantom Menace.",8,4,8,12 July 2007
Grindhouse," If Hollywood Could Turn back Time
","If you are a fan of films of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez (as I am) then you would know that they have a love for the old exploitation films of the '70's. This shows in a lot of Tarantino's films Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and big time in Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2. Rodriguez's mariachi trilogy (El Mariachi, Desperado, and Once Upon A Time In Mexico) shows his love for the genre big time.Tarantiono and Rodriguez are very good friends off camera and they even teamed up to bring us the modern day vampire classic From Dusk Till Dawn, a film which also showed their love for '70's exploitation films. It came to no shock when the two film makers announced they were going to team up to do a film called Grindhouse, which would be a double feature film, 1 film by Rodriguiez, and 1 film by Tarantino, giving a throwback to the Grindhouse era of films that played only in run down theater's in the worst section's of town.First up was a mock trailer by Rodriguiez called Machete, featuring Rodriguiez film alum Danny Trejo. Machete got a big reaction from the crowd as they were laughing. Machete looked like a Mexican version of Shaft.Next up was the first feature Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. Planet Terror is a zombie movie, plain and simple, nothing more, nothing less. It stars Rose McGowen who plays a Go-Go dancer (not a stripper, there's a difference) who helps lead a pack of idiot's from a small town in Texas (along with Freddy Rodriguez) to Mexico to escape the plague that's turning every one into zombie's.Planet Terror is a zombie film that would make George A. Romero smile. It's over the top violence, blood, and guts is every thing a horror film fan will love. The other thing that's great about Planet Terror is it plays like a movie that came out of the '70's. It looks like it was shot on 8 millimeter film. This is something that hi-def TV's will take away from this film.after Planet Terror was 3 more mock trailer's. First up was a film called Don't, which gathered a lot of laugh's from the crowd. After that came Heavy Metal's Rob Zombie's mock trailer Werewolf Women Of The SS, which as much as I love Zombie, was forgettable. After that came the best trailer of the night, Eli Roth's Thanksgiving, about a slasher dressed as a pilgrim going on a killing spree, hen came the 2nd feature Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.Death Proof is about a maniac retired Hollywood stunt car driver named 'Stuntman' Mike, who kills his victim's by vehicular homicide. Kurt Russel plays 'Stuntman' Mike, and steals every scene he's in. Russel was perfect in the role, and reminded me why I like him so much.That being said Taratino's Death Proof is the worse of the 2 films. I know Tarantino made his reputation for writing clever and witty duologue, but in Death Proof it goes over board. There is too many scenes where there is just to much talking and not enough action. At 1 point there was a scene where 3 women are talking in a coffee shop about certain cars and I was almost expecting Mr. Pink to appear and go off about how he doesn't tip.Tarantino tries to hard in this film to top Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction's witty talk, ad he just comes off looking like a director who is maybe starting to believe his own hype.Over all Grindhouse is a fun time at the movies, and for all you fans out there that act like going to the local multiplex is a fate worse than death, I suggest you get out and see this on the big screen. DVD and hi-def TV's will seriously take away the 'Grindhouse' feel that only the theater will provide. Seeing the film is a double feature with 2 90 minute films, and about 20 minutes worth of fake trailers, Grindhouse runs almost 3 and a half hour's long, so make sure you get you bathroom breaks in early.While Planet Terror is the better of the 2 films, The car chase scenes (to few and far between) in Death Proof are a blast, and make you realize that it is a good film, just Tarantino's worst compared to his other efforts.",7,1,4,10 April 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," These Movies Get Better And Better As They Go Along
","Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is great. It's definitely on my top 5 films of the year list. Having never read the book I just went into the film and took it for what it was. My wife on the other hand has read all the books and was saying that this book which the film is based on wasn't very good. So I guess my expectations were not to high. I was wrong. This is the best Potter film yet. It's funny, exciting, well written, well acted, and sometimes just down right creepy. This time around Harry is entered in a tournament that his school, Hogwarts is hosting called The Tri-Wizard Tournament. This is a dangerous tournament, that even the best and brightest wizards that attended Hogwarts have lost their lives in. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is terrified as well as his two best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Herminee (Emma Watson). Harry enters the tournament an extreme underdog. Goblet Of Fire is just fun, plain and simple. The movie is awesome. We also get to see what big budget CGI looks like when it's done right. Something George Lucas should have done when releasing the new Star Wars films. The Harry Potter films are everything and more than these new Star Wars films should have been. Don't get me wrong I loved Revenge Of The Sith but Phantom Menace was terrible and Attack Of The Clones, though better when I've seen it again, still lacks in quality. The Potter films have everything the original trilogy had. Character development and a great story. When Harry is fighting for his life against a deadly dragon you feel scared for him. When Herminee yells at Ron you feel mad at Ron as well. When Ron feels dumb for doing something idiotic you feel embarrassed for him. This is what made the original Star Wars trilogy characters great, and the same formula goes into the Harry Potter films. That's what makes them classics. The only issue the films can run into is the three main characters aren't getting any younger, and this could pose a problem. In January they begin filming the 5th movie Harry Potter And The Order Of The Pheonix. I imagine the filming of the 6th film Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince will begin shortly after that. J.K. Rowling has begun writing the 7th and final novel in the series, so that should be adapted to the screen rather quickly. I just hope it doesn't get rushed, but in the same vein I don't want to see anyone else play Harry, Herminee, or Ron. Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is great. Once again a wonderful world of imagination comes to life before your eyes. These films will be held in the same light as the original Star Wars trilogy. Just great, great, movie making. On a scale of 10 I give Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire a 10. This film, unlike the last 3 is rated PG-13, and it deserves it rating. It's much darker and could scare little kids. The tag line to the film is 'Everything Is About To Change.' Yes it is and believe me folks when I say, Change is good.",10,1,2,21 November 2005
Wedding Crashers," One of, if not my favorite comedy of all time
","Vince Vaughn is the greatest comedic actor ever. That's right I said it. I stand by my words too. Don't believe me? Go see Wedding Crashers and that should be prof enough for you. He's absolutely hysterical in Old School (The Animal House of the 21st century) funny as hell in Starsky & Hutch, and made me laugh my ass off in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Now once again he strikes gold in Wedding Crashers. The plot is a typical guy plot Vince Vaughn plays Jeremy Grey and his law partner Owen Wilson plays John Beckwith. John and Jeremy are wedding crashers. They show up at weddings they are never invited to, weddings for people they don't know just to meet women and have one night stands with. Jeremy lives for 'wedding season', as he calls it while John is getting tired of it all. So when the crashers decide to crash the ultimate wedding, the wedding of Treasury Secretary William Clearly (Played by the always funny Christopher Walkin) John has it in his mind that this is going to be his wan song. The problem is John does the ultimate no-no. He meets Claire Rachel McAdams) and begins to fall in love with her. In the mean time Jeremy meets Gloria (Isla Fisher) and she falls in love with him. This is a big rule for Jeremy. Never fall in love with or get attached with your flings. John is so hard fallen for Claire that he convinces Jeremy to go back to the Secretary's house for a weekend getaway. There John runs into another problem. That problem being the Secretary's wife Kathleen Cleary (An extremely funny turn by Jane Seymour) who has the hot's for John. Wedding Crashers is just downright hysterical. I laughed so hard i was crying. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson make a great on screen duo. Owen Wilson in my opinion always needs somebody to work with. Whether that be Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, or Jackie Chan. The problem is I don't think Owen or his brother Luke can ever be leading men in film. Vaughn on the other hand can take a comedy and run to the hills with it. He steals the show in Wedding Crashers. What makes him great is I don't think he knows just how funny he actually is. He's so dry. Which goes to show you not everybody needs to be all crazy and zany like Jim Carrey to be funny. Vaughn is most likely himself in this movie and that just makes him funny as hell. Like I said see his previous work in Old School and Dodgeball and you'll understand. However if you want to see him at his best Wedding Crashers is the movie. For the longest time my favorite comedy was American Pie. Now American Pie has some serious competition. Wedding Crashers is not for every one though. There is some nudity but some people could get turned off by the language and the sexual content. The content is also a big part of what makes the film funny. Especially the scene at the dinner table in the Secretary's mansion. I was in tears I was laughing so hard. If you're in the mood for greast time with some raunchy laughs then Wedding Crashers is your movie. If not then wait for rental. Either way I guarantee you'll be laughing. On a scale of 10 i give Wedding Crashers a 10. Great movie. Best comedy of the summer. Now about The 40 Year Old Virgin......",10,1,3,12 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best Of The New Trilogy. It Ranks Up With The Originals.
","George Lucas finally got this one right. After the schlock fest that were Episode I: The Phantom Menace & Episode II: Attack Of The Clones Episode III : Revenge Of The Sith (Or ROTS as I refer to it as) arrives like a superhero out of nowhere and saves the day. Sure the dialog is still cheesy as hell at times (Padme : 'Anakin, you're breaking my heart') and giving R2-D2 a fight scene the movie is still great. Unlike the last 2 films the light saber battles are long. And by long I mean Empire strikes back long. Plus unlike the last 2 films this one has a space battle dog fight that ranks up there with Return Of The Jedi's Death Star battle. The origin of Darth Vader is dark and almost painful to watch Anakin Skywalker go through the change. He resists and actually feels bad for carrying out his duties. Plus you feel bad for him because he's getting tricked by the Emperor to turn to the dark side as well as getting dogged by the Jedi council. The one scene that is actually a slight disappointment is actually when Darth Vader first appears on screen. It's a scene so right out of Frankenstien that i almost expected the Emperor to start screaming 'It's alive, It's alive'! However I went into ROTS expecting to be disappointed. instead ROTS has done the one thing that I never thought possible again...It made me fall back in love with Star Wars. Well done George, Welcome back.",9,1,3,13 June 2005
Iron Man," Fun, Plain And Simple
","I never was a big Iron Man fan. Don't get me wrong he was a good Avenger (for all you non-comic book fan's out there The Avengers is Marvel's version of The Justice League, again for all the non-comic book fans The Justice League is DC Comic's big superhero team more commonly known by their Saturday morning cartoon title The Super Friends)but Iron Man never did much for me as a solo character. Don't get me wrong he's had some good stories, like the alcoholic story line (where Tony Stark becomes such a drunk he has to give up being Iron Man) and Armor Wars (where evil bad guys get a hold of Stark's Iron Man technology and he has to fight like 8 billion Iron Men)but other than that he's never done much for me, so when i heard that an Iron man movie was being made i just shrugged it off, and held no interest.it had a few strikes against it for me. The first being Robert Downey Jr. was casted as Iron Man/Tony Stark. He's a good actor, but an action movie star? no way. The second it had Gwyneth Paltrow in it. I'm just not a fan of her's. Third was that Jon Favreau was directing it. I like Favereau, but i wasn't so sure that the man who directed the family comedy Elf (one of the ONLY good Will Ferrall movies)was the man to direct a big budget superhero action film. Then i saw the trailer.So needless to say, not caring to much for the character, but having great looking previews, I broke the news to my wife that she didn't have to see it, and headed to the local multiplex with my good friend Joe Lane, and special guest Paul Romanski (I hope that's how you spell it)and saw Iron Man. I have to admit i left the theater with an ear to ear grin on my face. Iron Man is a blast and I didn't want it to end. The summer movie season has kicked off and is off to a good start, if Iron Man is any indication.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a billionaire industrialist that owns Stark International, a company that specializes is manufacturing weapons of mass destruction. While in Afghanastan, demonstrating his latest weapon to the military, The Jericho Missle, Stark gets attacked and kidnapped by terrorists. They give Stark an ultimatum, build the terrorists a Jericho missile and be set free (yeah right) or refuse and die (like they wouldn't kill him any way). The thing that really scares Tony is that the terrorists all have Stark International weapons throughout their camp.Tony decides that instead of building them a missile he builds a suit of armor that looks like the Tin Man from The Wizard Of Oz on steroids, to bust out of and destroy the camp he was held captive in. The suit has machine guns, flame throwers, missile, and a jet pack. Tony succeeds and makes it back to civilization, which he realizes is not the same and makes some changes to his tin man suit,updating it and making it more modernized. Stark becomes Iron man, a superhero that doesn't attack normal criminals like muggers and thieves, but instead fights terrorists. That is how simple the plot of Iron Man is, and it kept me entertained for two hours and change.Iron Man, as much fun as it is does have it's faults, slightly. Terrance Howard (a very talented actor) seems almost wasted as James Rhodes, Starks best friend, Gwyneth Paltrow (who plays Pepper Potts, yes that's her name) comes off yet again as nothing more than a ditz, and Jeff Bridges (who plays Obadiah Stane) still plays the same roll in every movie.The shining spot of Iron Man is Robert Downey Jr., who proved that he deserved the roll. I almost forgot the Downey was playing Iron Man/Stark and that it wasn't Stark ripped right out of a Marvel comic. He was great, and I can't see any one else playing the roll. It's rumored that Iron Man and the upcoming Incredible Hulk movie will lead into an Avengers movie, with Downey appearing in The Hulk as Stark. We'll see about that one (rumors were Samuel L. Jackson was supposed to make a cameo in Iron Man as Nick Fury, and he didn't). If that happens remanis to be seen but Iron Man is left wide open for Iron Man II. No big surprise there.I would see Iron Man again in a heart beat, although i can see some people complaining that they will feel the film is to story driven and not enough action. where i come from I call that a good beginning.On a scale of 10 I give Iron Man an 8. Go, check your brain at the door, and have fun. I did.",8,1,3,2 May 2008
300," So Far, In This Early Tear, This Is The Movie To Beat
","I'm a comic book geek. For those of you that know me and read my reviews, this most likely will come as no surprise to you. I grew up on a steady diet of superhero comic's as a kid, and I'm proud to say it's still a diet I keep to this day. I love that superhero movies have broken out under the action genre label, and are now labeled as what they truly are, superhero. That being said though, it seems like most movie goers are getting burned out on superhero films. Hollywood has been cranking them out left and right, to the point now that second tier characters like Ghost Rider has gotten his own feature film.Does this mean that films based on comic books are a dead thing? No. Enter the anti-hero. The first big anti-hero film that made a big splash at the box office was Mike Mignol's Hellboy, a film in which the hero was a demon from hell. Then came the over rated but still good, A History Of Violence. The hero of that film was a killing machine for the mafia. Then the man that changed the face of comics forever with their dark undertones and more for adult audiences, Frank Miller threw his hat into the Hollywood ring and brought us the amazing film Sin City. Miller not only wrote and drew the graphic novels for Dark Horse Comics, he also co-wrote and co-directed with Robert Rodriguiez, to make the best comic to film transformation ever. Sin City was praised by fans and critics alike and it's sequel is in the works. It came to no surprise from me when I heard that Miller's other graphic novel that he wrote and drew, 300, was going to be brought to life.Like Sin City, 300 was filmed entirely in front of blue and green screens, and the back ground was totally computer generated. That doesn't mean the 300 wasn't amazing.300, so far in this early year is the best movie of 2007. The acting is awesome, the battle scenes are incredible, and it's just a fun movie. The plot is simple. The Persian Empire wants King Leonidas (Gerard Butler, who was awesome) to surrender Sparta to the Persian's. Leonidas refuses to do so and chooses to send his small country to war against the Persians. Sadly for King Leonidas, the corrupt council of Sparta will not back his plans to go to war and wants his to surrender.With no help from his country, Leonidas gathers 300 of his best soldiers, to fight against over 1 million Persian soldiers, and the results are an amazing film that deserves all the attention the very overrated Gladiator got.Unlike Sin City, Miller was not 100 percent hands on during this film. He wrote and produced 300 but did not direct. Instead Miller handed the directing chores to Zack Snyder, who directed the amazing Dawn Of The Dead re-make in 2004. That makes sense seeing as how Dawn of The Dead is about a handful of survivors fighting a million zombies.300 is a movie for guys who like movies. You just leave your brain at the door, or you can just turn it off, and go and watch the carnage unfold before you and have a blast like I did. I saw this film with my wife and two of my friends, and all four of us loved it. Fans who do not like a lot of violence and ballad will not enjoy this film, but for those who can overlook it, run, do not walk, to your local theater and see this film. It looks even better on an IMAX screen.Now a note to Mr. Miller. Please, Please, Please turn Batman: The Dark Knight Returns into a film.",10,7,15,12 March 2007
Fantastic Four," As good as the Spider-man & X-Men movies? no. Better than Daredevil, the Hulk, The Punisher, & The Blade trilogy? Yes.
","The Fantastic 4 has a bad rap. People think the previews look horrible, The effects look horrible, Etc. Etc. My advice is this. If you want to see a thinking man's comic book film then see either of the Spider-Man or X-Men films. If you want to go see a fun, leave your brain at the door, light hearted, semi-funny comic book film then go see The Fantastic 4. Basically in my opinion it's a live action Incredibles. The plot is pretty simple. 5 people (Reed Richards, Sue & Johnny Storm, Ben Grimm, & Victor Von Doom) go on a mission to space to explore a cosmic storm that they think could hold the key to curing diseases. Well they thought wrong as they get caught in the cosmic storm that unleashes radiation on them all giving them super powers. Reed gains the ability to stretch as his body becomes like rubber, Sue gains the powers of invisibility and can create invisible force fields, Johnny gains the ability to control fire as well as fly and turn his whole body on fire, Ben becomes this 'thing' that looks like orange rock, and Von Doom becomes disfigured and has the ability to control electricity. Reed, Sue, Johnny, & Ben use their powers for good, while Von Doom uses his powers for evil. The 4 take up the names Mr. Fantastic (Reed Richards played by Ian Grufford), The Invisible Woman (Sue Storm played by Jessica Alba), The Human Torch (Johnny Storm played by Chris Evans) & The Thing (Ben Grimm played by Michael Chickless, from my hometown Lowell, Ma.). Von Doom becomes Dr. Doom and tries to destroy The Fantastic 4 as the media has dubbed them. The F.F. is a classic superhero vs. the super villain story. Just like the comic book the film becomes lighthearted and funny when the story starts taking itself to seriously. the special effects on Mr. Fantastic, The Invisible Woman, and especially on The Human Torch are awesome. I (before going into this movie) thought the the Thing looked horrible. Seeing him on the big screen he looks a lot better than he does on the small screen. Chris Evans & Mike Chickless nail their roles perfectly. They had to have read a lot of the comics to get into their characters. Grufford & Alba are a little stale, but then again so are Reed Richards and Sue Storm. I can't remember the name of the actor who plays Doom but he was actually my biggest problem. Dr. Doom is the Magneto of The Fantastic 4. He's the Joker, or Lex Luthor if you will. Basically he's their biggest enemy. He needed to be more menacing. I'm not saying he was bad I'm saying he could have been better. Doom is the reason this movie doesn't rank higher than The rating I give it. All in all Though The Fantastic 4 is fun, an a good time at the movies. I hope there is a sequel. I think it will do good enough to gain a sequel. The again does that really matter? I mean the Flintstones got a sequel for crying out loud. I hope the screenwriters just make Doom a more menacing villain that he should be and that might put the Fantastic 4 franchise un track with the Spider-Man, & X-men franchise. On a scale of 10 I give the Fantastic 4 a 6 1/2 out of 10. Go to the movies, leave your brain at the door, and have a good time. Like I said if you enjoyed The Incredibles, you'll enjoy the Fantastic 4.",6,1,3,11 July 2005
The Simpsons Movie," One Of The Best 'Episodes' Of The Series
","When Mike Judge brought his series Beavis & Butthead to the big screen, he made a commercial free 90 minute episode. Die hard fans that expected to hear the two idiot stars of the show swear and see nudity were extremely disappointed, while occasional watchers (like myself) thought it was hilarious. The result? Even though it was one of the highest grossing animated movies of all time, Beavis & Butthead were canceled the following year.When Trey Parker & Matt Stone brought their series South Park to the silver screen, they slapped an 'R' rating on their already 'R' rated TV series and gave the fans what they wanted to hear, swearing and nudity. The film's plot revolved around the 4 main character's Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman swearing. The result? South Park was a huge success and recently celebrated it's 10th season on TV.So where does the Simpson's Movie stand? Somewhere in between these 2 movies. While there are 2 scenes in the film that they could never get away with on TV, the film for the most part is a 90 minute commercial free episode. There's even a joke about that in the very beginning of the movie. However this isn't a bad thing. If they had Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie swearing on the screen it would have taken something away from it. I'm glad they stuck to what made The Simpson's such a great TV show.In the beginning just about every supporting character makes a cameo, which is understandable, in a show that has over 1,000 supporting characters. There's even a great joke made by the punk rock band Green Day about the most successful, and over rated film of all time, Titanic. The Plot unfolds as Lisa gets the city of Springfield to clean up Springfield Lake (which is supposed to be Boston Harbor, yet another inside joke by native New Englander Matt Groening). After bending over backwards to get it clean, Homer decides to dump pig waste into it instead of the waste dump because the line was to long and he had to get to the donut shop for free donuts.In doing this Springfield becomes the most polluted city in America and get's in-closed in a giant dome. In a nutshell everyone's life becomes hell, thanks to Homer Simpson.The Simpson's is my all time favorite show, and I for one am psyched that they finally made it to the multi-plex after years of hinting for a movie. Die hard fans (like myself) will find it funny as hell, while even the casual fan (such as my wife, who I saw this with) will have a hard time not enjoying it. Over all it's just The Simpson's doing what The Simpson's do, just on a big screen, nothing more, nothing less.A lot of people seem to think that the show has run out of steam, since the writing team split up to do Futurama. I have to disagree. I've been watching this series since season 1, and 18 seasons (yes you read right, 18 seasons) later, the longest running sitcom in history (I don't want to hear anybody complain about it's easier because it's animated) still has yet to let me down as I have never missed an episode.It's nice to see that Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie have finally made it to Hollywood. However I can't help but think that maybe this could mean that the series is finally coming to it's end. If that's true I can only hope that maybe we'll see more of The Simpson's in Hollywood. That's something I can't complain about.",8,3,7,30 July 2007
V for Vendetta," Not Since A Clockwork Orange Has A Film Been So Brilliant
","People say American Pie is this generations Porky's. People say that Old School is this generations Animal House. If these are true then V For Vendetta is this generations A Clockwork Orange. By saying that I don't mean that we see people running around in long johns, and Derby hats raping women and beating people to death. It's just going to get that type of cult following. Some people might be turned off by the subliminal Bush bashing message hidden with in the film (After all it got the very attractive Natalie Portman, who is a very political activist to shave her head for the role of Evy) but other people will just enjoy the movie for what it is. Very entertaining. Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, written about 20 years ago, V For Vendetta takes place in a futuristic London. Now by futuristic I don't mean flying cars and Jetson's type technology. The world of tomorrow in this film looks like the world of today. This London is run by a dictator of a man played by John Hurt. He tells people how they should, and will leave. We then meet Evy (Natalie Portman, Star Wars) who is caught by 'Fingermen' (The government agents of London) because she is out past curfew. When she screams for help because the fingermen are going to have her do them 'favors' for not getting in trouble, we then meet our hero V (Hugo Weaving, The Matrix, and Lord Of The Rings Trilogies). Now V isn't like your typical hero. He wears all black, has a pointy pilgrim hat and hides his face behind a mask that reminds me of The Joker. V seems borderline insane and Evy doesn't know exactly what to make of her strange knight in shining armor. Before she knows it, Evy has been dragged into V's one man war against the government. His modo is 'People should not be afraid of their government, government's should be afraid of their people. V For Vendetta will not cater to everyone (I did see this film with my wife, who hated it, and my two friends who liked it) but it will become a cult classic in the same vein as Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. People that have read Moore's brilliant graphic novel will love it as most of the film is scene for scene, word for word just like the book. Although Moore hated this film so much he did not want his name in the credits, which makes me wonder why? This was a far better adaptation than his last story come to life The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I admit I was nervous when I heard The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy) had wrote this film because while The Matrix was amazing, the follow up's were something to be desired for. Looks like they found what they were missing when they wrote Matrix 2 and 3. V For Vendetta is rated R for violence and language. On a scale of 10 I give V For Vendetta a 10.",10,1,7,20 March 2006
