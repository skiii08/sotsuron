Moneyball," Not a bad film but the point was strange
","Not a bad film but really the point was kind of strange and seemed to promote statistical marketing which has really limited our selection of restaurants, stores etc... It also demonstrates that budget isn't everything to the game either.Production-wise this film must've been on some kind of budget where they couldn't afford to do a lot of lighting. Over-all the cinematography is very dark, flat and uncomplimentary to the story. This includes outdoor shots. Compare it to the cinematography of 'The Natural' or 'Field of Dreams'. This seems like a strange place to cut from when your film is on a budget.",6,1,3,24 March 2013
Gravity," In the film 'Gravity,' oxygen wasn't the only thing in short supply.
","In the film 'Gravity,' oxygen wasn't the only thing in short supply. Acting skill, personality, rational physics and a sensible plot were sorely lacking. To nominate Sandra Bullock for Best Actress is to slap the face of every actress. To give the director an Oscar derides the Hollywood establishment as a whole. Take a long look at the last shots in the film then scratch your head and say the words,'Best Director'. The only thing that stood out in this film were special technical effects. They make the film worth watching but don't expect the plot to be as sophisticated as the effects. Consider the plot to be on the level of a Saturday morning cartoon.",2,1,3,10 March 2014
Midnight in Paris," Poor color grading, poor casting, and a flawed slow moving story but if you like Paris see it.
","From the very beginning there is an imbalance to the overall color of the film. Perhaps this is to give the film a dated look but it was not done correctly. The colors in many of the opening shots are over-saturated. Occasionally one shot will have very nice color in contrast to the rest. The technical term for this production role is color grading and I would say they left it to an intern.The story is painfully flawed and Owen Wilson is miscast in the lead role. Michael Sheen on the other hand is very believable and funny. It can be pleasing to enjoy the scenes in Paris, some of the historic characters and events can capture the imagination but over all it doesn't work and isn't a solid film.",4,0,3,26 January 2013
Dunkirk," Shallow, Docile and Inexplicably Resolved War Film
","Not sure this film deserves 8 stars. I'm not sure I've seen a more docile war film. The actors seemed empty and without much to say despite what they are supposedly experiencing. The scene with men in a sinking boat considering throwing someone out to reduce the weight is nonsense. The boat is metal with a dozen geysering holes, they're waste deep in water. The film was resolved very quickly with no clear explanation.",3,1,1,13 December 2017
