First Man," Too little, too late
","What did this film accomplish, that wasn't already accomplished through previous films on the topic?30 years ago, this film might have been an 8/10. The filming style, for one, was impressive: shooting on reflective surfaces without seeing the camera in the reflection, for example, and also how genuinely and appropriately antiquated the look and feel of the film was. But the story wasn't executed in a way where you really felt the tension. And we've already had more than enough films depicting floating around in space and firing thrusters to successfully dock. Granted, it's realistic. But we didn't need yet another film focusing so much time on it.",6,11,19,22 October 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Couldn't suspend my disbelief
","Did I just witness an MCU Theatrical Release? It felt like a straight-to-DVD, non-canonical experiment. The things in the film that did make sense, only served to undermine or undo all that has been accomplished in these characters' trajectories over the past few years. And I tried to think of exceptions to that statement, but that only increased my frustration.For example, the character of Loki will always be a favorite, and the tension between his villainy and the love his brother has for him always works well for me (including in this film), but the setup we got in the last film (with Loki deceiving everyone into thinking he's Odin) was scrapped and simply laughed off. Same thing with Thor's intense connection with Jane, which we've been developing over time: laughed off. And Thor's vow to Doctor Strange? Also laughed off. Didn't we witness Thor learn honor and integrity over the years? And yet he vows to take Loki and his father and return straight to Asgard, which he eventually does do, but in the end he has the choice of taking everyone anywhere in the nine realms, and where does he choose? The exact planet he'd promised to vacate. At least with Skurge the question of loyalty showed some inner vexation, but even that felt out of character.So much made no sense. Why does constantly raining trash on Sakaar make such teeny tiny piles? And why is the entire population of Asgard so tiny too? Why do the sets feel so fake? Why are none of the jokes funny? Why does Thor refer to his experiences with the Avengers as 'work' (as if his God-of-Thunder duties are something he goes home from)? I hated that line in the preview. Why does Thor express no sorrow when his close band of warrior friends is killed? What are Hela's powers, and why do she and her costume instantly recover from stabbings? Why does Hela's admittedly bad-ass crown change back and forth between two distinct styles (sometimes covering her cheekbones, and sometimes not)? And if Thor has a mystical power (namely, the ability to mask his hammer as an umbrella), why combine that with a scene where Thor is being subjected to Doctor Strange's tricks, making it seem like the umbrella deception is Doctor Strange's doing? It's needlessly confusing. And what's the reason the Hulk is stuck as the Hulk, not returning to Banner form (nor increasing in size when attacked during combat) for two years? And why did the first teaser trailer ruin so many important plot points? (I'm SO glad I didn't watch the later previews, which ruin even more of the story.) Oh, and if you're going to give a rock creature a voice, why choose a vocal style so dependent on nuanced lip control, rather than a back-of-the-throat voice? All these things take the audience out of the movie.This film had so much potential, so many opportunities wasted. Take Hela's healing for example: the camera never focuses on how she's impervious to stabbings, and this could have been a profound cause of fear and suspense for the characters, rather than a cause of audience disbelief. We also got a build-up of suspense when the Hulk attacks the flaming giant Surtur, but then he quickly and awkwardly retreats, anti-climactically. Also bizarre: when Odin dies, we aren't given the chance to linger in the moment, and Thor certainly doesn't seem shaken up about it. Even the torturous murder of the Grandmaster's cousin is laughed off. And the actors were allowed to ad-lib too much; there was immense potential for some really good lines, but these opportunities were wasted too. Just lazy.Oh, and the '80s-style synth music felt really forced, like it were added on later because it's popular. The new Blade Runner handled this much, much better. Thor: Ragnarok just felt slapped-together.",4,10,20,3 November 2017
Joker," Isn't it obvious that... (Spoiler about climax)
","Rarely does a movie goof completely change the audience's ability to follow the story, but the Joker's makeup suffered such an obvious discontinuity, that it convinced me the climactic scene didn't even happen. The Joker had a clear smudge of blue paint coming down from one eye (from crying), all the way down his cheek, and it was suddenly all cleaned up for the entire climactic sequence (okay, sure, it makes sense he'd fix his makeup before going on camera for a national audience) but as soon as that scene ends, his makeup again looks exactly like it did before he met the talk-show host in the dressing room. Sooo... I mean clearly it was just another fantasy of the Joker's, right? It seems so obvious to me, yet I haven't heard anyone else comment on it.Joker is one of those movies where the preview gets a 10/10 but the actual movie doesn't.",4,3,8,29 December 2019
It Chapter Two," As tedious as Chapter One
","There just really isn't much to say about this film or Chapter One. Nothing surprising or scary happens, and many scenes felt like they were directed and filmed by entirely different people, with not much holding it together. Watch this movie or just relax on a deck chair with a cold drink: both will have the same amount of chill.One thing I enjoyed about Chapter One: Pennywise was at least interesting there. Not scary, but... I found him fascinating. I wish this film tried to keep him interesting. I'm not sure what I was supposed to find interesting this time around, except maybe the Stephen King cameo.",3,7,12,6 September 2019
