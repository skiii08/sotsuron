The Avengers," What's wrong with Americans?
","Okay, I'm expecting a full-packed action film but instead I get a more drama than action film. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not as I expected in an 'ultimate' superheroes movie. Ultimate as more superheroes = more awesomeness.However, most of this film is more about battle of ego than saving the world, actually their ego are the real threats to this world. Except Hulk which seems there purely for action, the others need some push and a good person must die, like saving the world is not enough cause and a retaliation/revenge gives better reason. So some reel time is waste for this 'superhero drama' instead for action. I kind of disappointed with these 'selfish' superheroes. Luckily, Hulk gives several comic relief and save the movie.The action is slowly build up towards the end (too slow for me) but it pays off in the final battle. Not as spectacular as I expected but in the end it provides just enough reason why there must be a team like Avengers in this Marvel Universe. The thing that disturbed me the most is those Americans, those people who happen to be in the wrong time at the wrong place - well, not only in this film but also others like the Transformers series, etc. The city streets has become the battle ground and those mortal, ordinary people still there in the streets, watching very closely like it's just a parade or a flash mob and deliberately provide themselves as collateral damages. What's wrong with these people? Is every Americans so stupid or have suicidal tendencies? Audience can except the collateral damages, the panicked citizens, people runs for their life in the 1st 3 minutes of the battle, but after that the filmmaker should simply have a scene of these people watching from afar, behind road blocks with police guard, peeking from a secure hide-out etc.The execution is good but the script could be improved. We already know they are superheroes and there are already prequels for each character so instead of taking lots of time talking out of their differences, let these characters solve their differences in battle over battle before the final one. Lots of battle, lots of action's awesomeness. Therefore, my grin could last for days. They also failed to explain why Hulk can transform from an uncontrollable destroyer into a cooperative teammate in no time which feels like I miss some important scenes.The use of CGI - after several 'heavy CGI' films - is starting to become dull. It's like the film maker has no other choice to awe audience than using bigger explosion, more fatal destructions. Film like 'chronicles' provide better use of CGI for enhancing the story while not as grande as this. So overall, I give it 6.5/10. Sorry for my English.",7,4,12,21 May 2012
Men in Black 3," No K hence should be No J
","I need to let it out of my chest. J was recruited by K so if K is not around then J should not be an MIB agent. This is a big plot hole and happen in the beginning which I find hard to accept it along the way. It's kind of ruining the movie for me.Actually the solution for this enormous hole is easy, just get another agent like agent O, hires J again, since her colleague (K) ask her to keep an eye on him - for the reason explained in the end of the movie.So, in my alternate script, the next day after the disappearing of K, J in his black tuxedo (explain later that at that time he's a cop just having dinner with GF or any other reason why he wear a black tuxedo - so we the audiences think that he's an MIB agent) is hunting down a guy (similar scenes to MIB 1 but of course more spectacular) which then turns out an alien, but J feels it's like a deja vu, then when agent O recruited him (like K did in 1st installment) and somehow mentioning how she were monitoring him as requested by K (which make us, the audience more curious about what happen), J has this urge to dig out about who is K and what happen to him since K feels very familiar/close. He's digging his way around - of course in a bad way - until he finds that timekeeper guy, who explain what might happen and then J decided to do the time jump, and we go back to the original script.However, although Josh Brolin's act as younger K is superb, the story/script is not getting better (do I have to make another alternate script?) since what we see is this 2 agent hunting a criminal with minimum twist. They didn't make their way by trashing the alien community in the 60s upside down to find Boris. I think a lot of audience including me are expecting J to make some serious mess.Instead they find a super mentalist alien who tell them everything they need to know and help them get to the place they need to be. It's like watching the Mentalist TV series or Twilight and not the good episode one.So 4/10 from me, better watch it at home.",4,3,6,8 July 2012
The Expendables 2," Lower your expectation, almost become a B-movie action parody
","After watching the 1st expendables, I have a mixed but positive feeling about the series. Seeing these heroes from my past doing actions altogether is kind of reliving and refreshing their hypes and legends. I can say The Expendables is a good action movie and while it satisfies me in a certain level (not to the max), it delivers and makes me hungry for more, at least a trilogy.So I came to theater with high expectation and sadly, the Expendables 2 is quite a disappointment for me. Somehow, it feels like a B-movie action comedy parody. Some scenes are suppose to be awesome but turn into cheesy ones instead. For example, when Van Damme killed one of the good guys, he made Adkins hold a dagger in front of that guy chest and then doing a turning kick........So? do we supposed to see it in disbelief or say 'Wow?' When Sly's (almost) full team is ambushed and cornered, someone secretly helped them by wipe out all their enemies, blowing up a tank/heavy artillery in just seconds, and then he (an action legend) show up (famous whistle from cowboy movies plays in background) while Sly's said 'Don't freak...don't freak' - carrying only a semi automatic rifle..(???) I admit it's a funny scenes but quite a parody. Then, almost in the end of the movie, all of those action legend are showing up - I know they're up to something - and yes, everyone of them get a healthy dose of shooting weapons and killing enemies. Those poor bad dudes are nowhere to be found in the previous part of the film and probably are there in the last part so everyone in good guy team can contribute about 50 kills/each.I'm expecting more duel than Expendables, but in here, there are only two duel and one of them is not worth to mention, I look for more hand to hand combat than the 1st series which both side are hurt, torn apart but in the same time they grow respect for each other skills. But it's just a plain nasty bad guys vs cool hero stuff, both throwing bullets I expect...well a lot of things but undelivered except seeing those legends and remembering how they have entertained me in the past. And I don't think I'll be excited for the 3rd installment now. And strangely, Jet Lee give better impact on me in his limited screen time than that Chinese girl who replaces him throughout the film.So, if you want to watch this and still enjoy it, you should lowered your expectation. It's not like the 1st installment. Sorry for my English (4/10)",4,9,12,2 October 2012
Skyfall," My Name is Bourne.....Jason Bourne
","What makes Bond's series so special? In my opinion, because they have the best villains who want to rules the world, conquer some countries, killing million of people just for their breakfast, girls who have rare qualities not just some bimbos, highly advanced technologies which may hit the market pretty soon, unlimited support from MI6 even some helps from CIA, Interpol, government, military etc around the world, even in the isolated area and any other 'over the top' things we could imagine. Yes, these aren't real, but we get that picture long ago. So by stripping those and replace Craig with Damon will make Skyfall another Bourne movie. And somehow the grand Bond's theme we normally get in the beginning and the end of the movie sounds well..too grand.Now, apart from that, this movie actually pretty decent as an action movie. The story, acting, action scenes, etc are quite gripping. The first 20 mins of this movie will immediately put you right in the middle of the story and you don't want to miss it till the end.There are some plot holes. I guess, when people make a movie as real as they can, the plot holes also became easier to see. For example, when the villains in police uniform are after M, Bond already warned her, but the security in that building is quite loose and those villains infiltrate the building with less resistance. In fact, the villains practically do their plan so smooth almost like getting candy from a baby. While Bond's team struggle to keep up. I'm also wonder why MI6 seems has no support from their own government, police, military etc, while the bad guy could easily get police car, military chopper etc.So, while the movie is quite good, I can only score it 7 for not being a true Bond movie. I hope the next one could be better, if it's just become a follower of Bourne's series, well the Bond's era will be gone.",7,4,12,5 November 2012
World War Z," Surprisingly Bad !
","This is one of the film I was waiting for but after seeing it I come out the theater disgruntled. The trailer and the hype are very promising, the execution is fine but logic of the story and plot is a let down. It's like a cross between 'Outbreak' and 'Walking Dead' but there are some obvious illogical background I can not ignore.The story starts when an outbreak of Zombie virus turn a city into a massive chaos. Gerald Lane and his family is there and after some series of lucky events they manage to save themselves on the roof of apartment. Then military helicopter specially sent to pick them Gerald Lane is sort of UN investigator (?), and deliver them to a US Nimitz class carrier which serves as US Army HQ. Then he unwillingly go to North Korea along with US SEAL team and a virologist to find the source of virus so his family can stay in the ship (how cruel...)See, for me this background failed to provide Gerald Lane's rapport. I don't see why he is the perfect choice among probably tenth thousands of highly skilled and trained people in this ship. Simply he has to be in this team to save the world.Then in North Korea he finds out more about these Zombie, that they are drawn by sounds, crushing their head is the only way to stop them but then we see a burned zombie who still has 2 fingers alive though his head is just ashes (?)Next, he went to Israel which is the 1st country in the world who successfully anticipates this crisis but all this time the whole country (compare to a bunch of soldiers in North Korea) doesn't know that sounds make this Zombies go crazy (?). And when a zombie's bite turns normal person to zombies in just seconds, means the virus spreads very very quickly , if someone's hand is bitten, all you have to do is cut just inches above that hand to prevent this person become zombie (?) The virus should have spread to half of her body for god sake.<ul><li>SPOILER ahead - After surviving a plane crash (yes now you know Gerald Lane is chosen probably because he's the luckiest person who can escape from anything), he concludes that the virus only attracted to healthy people. They ignore people who's terminally ill. Gosh. I can't take this anymore. I mean there are a lot, probably millions of terminally ill people compare to billions of people in earth and not a single one of them can inform this simple fact to any government in the world? Where are they? - SPOILER Ends -</li></ul>So, I really disappointed with this movie. I still give '3' since the acting is decent and the special effect is quite good. But the rest is surprisingly bad.",3,1,6,16 September 2013
Terminator Salvation," Good Movie but not a Terminator sequel...
","I'm a big fan of Terminator and have watched all the T1 to T3 and also have them on my DVD collection. I think the essence of the Terminator series is how some inferior creature (and robot) being chased and hunted by a very superior indestructible killing machine(s) and survived. Along this plot, there are some mind-blowing action, explosion, sacrifice, drama, heroes, moral values, etc which push the audience stays in their seat till end of the film.The T3 was weaker than the T1 and T2 but still follow this plot. However, the T4 has a new plot : it's an open war, not a chase/hunting scenes. A war in the future between two races. If we replace all the character's name in this film, then it's hard to link this film to previous 'T' series.However, I didn't say it's a a bad movie. I think McG has tried his best, but the script is not powerful enough to fuel this film. Some scenes like John listening to his mom's tape or the 'I'll be back' scene does not make me feel that this is a sequel.So, I give 7/10 since it's a nice action movie. That's all. Sorry for my English.",7,2,3,7 June 2009
Fast & Furious 6," Exaggerated Villains....
","First of all, this movie is quite awesome, but not as good as Fast 5 which IMO is the best of all FF franchise. The plot is more simple with a predictable twist in the end. The story also serves for wrapping up all the FF series for a grand finale in FF7 so it loads with lots character and effort to tie those loose ends (but not convincing enough) in previous sequel and rearrange the series in order so we can see now that FF3 is actually the FF6. So no wonder, there are some unnecessary scenes (ie Connor meets Braga in jail) which make less portion of actions scenes.The FF team become more solid in this sequel, everyone has a good portion to show their character and role in the movie. I think Han & Gisele relationship here somehow is more subtle & memorable than 'it'a all about family' excuses that Dom and others bragging about throughout the film.However, the villain team is under my expectation. They are not as Hobbs, Braga or others picture them to be. They don't look scary, mean or dangerous to me, they just look tense and a bit nervous, except Shaw and that big Russian guy. While Shaw indeed is a cool and thinker mastermind, it's hard to believe that he is as powerful as Braga said. He doesn't have that powerful and dominant charm/aura.So 7 out of 10 from me.",7,0,2,27 May 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," A teenage hero movie which more serious than all those 'grown up' Avengers
","When you reboot a story, there must be some necessary stuff which should be included in the previous version but completely left out. So the reboot version should give better perspective about the hero or his story.I'm not Spider-man comic fans but I watch all Sam Raimi's film including Spider-man. And I still feel that his version does not need any reboot.The film itself is developing quite slow, it's like a Disney teenager movie when a teen slowly building his rapport throughout the film and become somebody but in very serious way. It's more about Peter Parker than Spider-man, which I think could be speed up since it's become boring in 2nd half due to its darker tone and very serious ambiance.The film itself is quite decent but nothing extraordinary. And I still like the Sam Raimi's Spiderman because he seems more fun.6/10",6,4,11,9 July 2012
Captain America: Civil War," Crouching Spider Hidden Panther
","In short, this is an American Wuxia movie. Superheroes are similar to those martial art warriors in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon genre, who can leap over building, have superhuman strength, bend physical law etc. Each has his/her unique fighting style and weapons. And just like a wuxia movie, the plot is about love, friendship, revenge and betrayal.Even you can relate some action scenes to Asia's martial arts movie, like when Cap is gunned down and fall from building to the ground, Jacky Chan's stunt has done that 'fall' before. The way Black Widow/Romanoff doing 'parkour' in the market, just like Donnie Yen did in 'Bodyguards and Assassins' and so on. The Russo's brothers seem to be a martial art fans and it's good, they made the action scenes awesome by combining the grace of Asia/Hongkong's martial art and the explosive/spectacular of Hollywood's CGI and special effects.However, I always see Captain America as the one who obeys the laws while Iron Man always breaks them, so throughout the movie I couldn't get rid the feeling that their roles in the story are mismatched. Another thing, while it's a superb action movie, it somehow lacks of emotional depth. Their motives are just rational. Therefore, Spiderman and Black Panther are able to steal the show, hence I put them on my title review. Really looking forward for their own films.Perhaps for the next installment, the Russo's should also add spices of Korean drama to the mix :).",7,2,7,31 May 2016
2012," Make sure you come just for special effect.
","I have watched lots of Roland Emmerich's movies so I went to Cinema hoping to watch a group of people, families, antagonists and protagonists which struggle together to overcome even the most unbelievable enemies - you know, giant UFOS (ID4), spiders (Eight Legged Freaks), lizard (Godzilla), blizzards(The Day after Tomorrow) and now disasters - and survive. This is a proved formula to entertain people.However, the plot here is the other way around. I watch earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis which have to 'struggle' to overcome their most unbelievable enemies : a group of die hard people.No matter what kind of disaster is being thrown to them, they can overcome it with just minor scratches. The story stop for me when a continent moved to save their poor asses. Can't take it anymore.I switched my mind off and just waiting for breathtaking CGI scenes to watch. Don't even care about all the conflicts, heroic speeches, act of bravery etc in the finale, since these people are NOT ordinary people anymore. Definitely, they'll survive from anything.Luckily the special effect is top-notch, so I'm not really wasting my >2 hours time for nothing - not include my effort to get the ticket.Gave 6/10 because the special effects. Sorry for my English.",6,0,0,19 November 2009
X-Men: Apocalypse," Blame it to the Russo's
","The movie starts with unrealistic CGI, for a ritual ground that has been used for thousand years, everything looks so fresh and brand new, with sort of high-tech equipment. It should be old and mystical. Then it follows with some gore actions which made my kids close their eyes. I beginning to think I made mistake by taking them to watch this movie. Thanks God that it become more kid-friendly throughout the time. While my kids have quite a good time, I think it's below my expectation.Take the explosion that happens in the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. It make my kids laughs, while I feel that scene is not suppose to be funny. And then we meet Wolverine and Col Stryker, which turns out they're just cameos. And then the action. Perhaps I put my expectation about the action quite high, because they are Marvel's characters just like Captain America and friends. And Civil Wars has just released so it's unavoidable to compare both. Civil Wars is full of spectacular action, with heroes which not just rely only on their gift but primarily on their skills. While this X- Men movie, the actions have simple, uncreative choreography which just relying on their gifts. These heroes almost has no skill. Blame it to the Russo's whose made the final battle in this X-Men series looks like just some people trying to hit their opponent as hard as they can.If I watched this movie alone, I may give lower score. That score above is because my kids still can enjoy it.",6,2,12,9 June 2016
Elysium," Another version of District 9
","I watched this movie because of 3 names: Jodie Foster, Matt Damon and Neill Blomkamp. A strong actress, a good action actor and a promising director whose film (District 9) is quite a fresh take of sci-fi genre but somehow feels like a documentary, a bit flat. I was expecting this time, there wil be more emotion, more drama, more upz and downs like a roller coaster. But somehow, this was also feels the same like his previous movie.Even the story is feel like just another version of District 9. Both about 2 separated colony. Then one colony wants to have a better future and invade the other and these movies have similar rhythm and tone. The difference is, the hero in District 9 is a cop protecting the invaded colony, this time our hero is 'the alien' invading the colony trying to save his life. I think the director has an obsession about 2 conflicting colony since he's from South Africa.It's not the best act from Matt Damon and certainly Jodie Foster great talent in here is being wasted.",6,0,1,21 November 2013
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi is Back !
","Whoa! It's been a long time since I watched a good horror movies. This reminds me of Evil Dead 1 & 2 (but not Army of Darkness). I am expecting something like this from Sam Raimi and he delivers it slightly above my expectation.Since the beginning, the film shots have make me immersed in the story. The pace, the thrills, the twists are beautifully arranged. Yes, I know several times when the movies is about to make me jump, but Sam always able to deliver a good jump.The CGI is too much and not so real, but I think this film doesn't need them. I quickly ignore them since the plot itself and how it delivered are really blow me away. I come out from theather with my mind full and still can't remove the eerie feelings that I got from this movie.8/10 from me. Sorry for my English",8,0,3,7 June 2009
Joker," This is killer clown not Joker
","Joaquin Phoenix may deserve an Oscar for his portrayal. This is a dark, insane movie which I gladly praise, but somehow I couldnt see this as a Joker's movie. I cant imagine such a weak and sick man become Joker. And this is not a DC superhero/villain movie.And now DC has problem, cause if there's a Batman movie, this Joker persona may overshine Batman, but if you make Joker any less, the audience will be disappointed.I think this is a psychological drama movie. Too heavy to be part of DC universe.",9,3,6,18 November 2019
Pitch Perfect," The Pitch is quite perfect but the story is plain and boring...
","Watched this movie last week, it's not a musical but a movie about transformation of Barden's Bella acapella team. This movie actually has the potential, all the girls has their own background which means there are several side stories which could make it more interesting, ie about Aubrey, why she throws up when she stress, the sex-maniac Stacie, or about Fat Amy, a fat girl but seems very popular among handsome men. But it's focus on Beca's life which I think it's just plain and dull. This make the scenes between those fine acapella composition passable.The acapella compositions on the final are good but it's not as exciting as the riff-off scene.",6,1,3,29 January 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," Just 'Law and Order' Episode for Big Screen
","Law Abiding Citizen is a story of a man whom his family were brutally murdered, then after being let down by the court, decides to give all the people involved a lesson. (he said it's not a vengeance, but I believe it is).And because he's so damn smart, he confesses his crimes, thrown to jail, even kept in the solitary cell and he can still killing people.So, it was 'Death Wish' meet 'Silence of the Lambs', a genius and very angry guy who has all the skill needed to wipe out the entire city if he has to and also do his homework so he can play well in the game of law, is aiming to balance score and even want to 'fix' the corrupt system. This premise is so promising but does not live the hype because the script is weak. After his 3rd victims, he (I may say the script writer) has become uncreative and predictable which make me feel like watching another episode of 'Law and Order' TV series.After watching the movie, I keep thinking why they didn't make his family murder as a conspiracy. So after his revenge to all those thugs, he start killing people who give the order one by one, and the DA has to use all of his resources to unfold the conspiracy, discover his method before this 'hannibal' gets him too at last. This way, the story can be kept unpredictable and amusing than targeting government officials as sitting ducks and saying that it's not a vengeance.And if he's so damn genius, why he can't figure out a simple fact that killing all the gov't official will not bring the system down or even fix it?. They will simply be replaced by another official, and then what? kill em all again and again? So, this film execution itself is fine but lacks of a good & strong script, which make me give 6/10.
