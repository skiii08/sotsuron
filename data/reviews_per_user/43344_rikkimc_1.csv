Ali," Exhilarating
","Seriously fantastic. Especially interesting - given the current atmosphere in the US - was the depiction of Ali's refusal to be drafted to Vietnam and getting branded as anti-patriotic. No surprise, of course, but still sickening to watch how Ali was identified for methodical destruction by the US government, and how the Nation of Islam used him and dropped him when convenient.Terrific soundtrack and cinematography. I wish there had been a little more coverage of his falling out with Malcolm X and his second wife.Jamie Foxx was outstanding and deserves big recognition for this role.Go see it!!",9,0,0,25 December 2001
