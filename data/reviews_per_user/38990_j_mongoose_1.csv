Catch Me If You Can," Good popcorn movie
","An all-around good movie worth seeing.  The plot is pretty basic: Quick-thinking kid from a broken family that he loved.  He spent the next few years playing a pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Think 'Pretender' (the television series) but based on real events.  The surprise was the unique relationship of the FBI agent and the con-man in their cat-and-mouse chase they have over the years around the globe.  An engaging film that you are curious to see how it ends. That goes even for my girlfriend who stayed awake for the entire movie because she was captivated by it [Note: she has slept thru 'Gladiator', 'Shakespeare in Love', 'Elizabeth', and the 'Fellowship of the Ring' because they (apparently) didn't peak her interest].  So if your date is the discriminating-type, he/she should be able to sit through this movie and enjoy it.",8,63,110,24 May 2003
