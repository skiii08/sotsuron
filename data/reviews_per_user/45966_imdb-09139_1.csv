Walk the Line," Boring Life, Boring Story
","Due to the many poitive reviews, I expected Johnny Cash to have an interesting life. But basically, he was a loser and and an asshole at once. There's literally nothing interesting about him that I learned in this movie, I didn't even recognize a single song of his. Thus I think that this movie is only for people who were born way before the 90s or haven't seen many movies yet. And of course fans of Johnny Cash's music (in case there are any who don't fall into one of my previous requirements). To everyone else this is a very well played and directed documentary about a very successful musician a long time ago, without any relevance whatsoever to today's way of life or movie audience habits.",3,0,2,9 February 2020
