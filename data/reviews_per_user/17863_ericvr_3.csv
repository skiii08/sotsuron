Child 44," Excellent Film: The reason I go to movies...
","This is an excellent film. I go to movies all the time and this is one of those that you say to yourself, 'That was a great movie!' (BTW - not connected to movie at all)Why go see it? - Great acting (Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Noomi Rapace)(They have intricate twists in their character) - Deep. thought-out believable characters - Unpredictable and believable storyline - An unfolding Thriller / with high stakes - A romantic connection with real world depth - Engrossing movie world. brought me into the story. - Deep 'all-at-stake' movie that was actually also a 'FEEL-GOOD' movie.Ignore the 'history buffs' critics and go see it. You'll love it! Intense! 9 out of 10",9,44,99,22 April 2015
Divergent," This is a Great Movie!
","This is a Great Movie! A very well-acted well written script. I've never read the book, but the story was very easy to follow and very engaging. I just let the story come to me, let it set it's own pace and wow awesome! I really loved it! Great twists, good action, heroic moments, excellent drama, romance and heart. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM. I lied it just as much as Hunger games, maybe even a little better. It seemed more realistic and sincere. It is not as scientifically sophisticated as movies like Gattaca or Artificial Intelligence. And it's not as large scale as LOTR or Ben Hur. But it a really good flick. It was good, from top to bottom, start to finish. I will definitely go to the Movie theaters to see it at least one more time. And I hope there are a few of sequels planned. People need to give this movie a chance. They will not be disappointed. This is a Great Movie!",9,8,30,21 March 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," I totally loved it!
","This Hobbit part 2, was a double blessing, especially, if you're a LOTR fan as well. Pure Hobbit fans are certain to cry out loud, because Peter Jackson does add and elaborate to the story using some imagined details from LOTR appendices. I for one loved it! I grew up reading all of the books every year, and know the big picture of everything that Tolkien spoke about. I believe that Tolkien would have loved it. He would have been honored by it. Shame on his family and family estate rom robbing us of the parts Peter Jackson has no access to. What a pity, that they are so small minded. I feel like with Smaug, we got a Hobbit part 2 and a LOTR prequel. I hope Hobbit part 3 does it even more. What a fun movie!!! Just accept the movie with it's multidimensional layers and enjoy the ride. It is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!",10,3,11,15 December 2013
