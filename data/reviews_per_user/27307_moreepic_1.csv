Blade Runner 2049," Superb plot, acting, and cinematography. Successfully builds on the world that its predecessor created.
","Plot: Amazing. Well paced. Unpredictable. Detailed. Tied into the original Blade Runner perfectly without requiring viewers to have watched the origingla.Characters: Magnificently developed. Highly believable personalities and motivations. Well-written dialogue, in very much the same quotable fashion as the original Blade Runner.Acting: Freaking superb. I just watched 'The Last Jedi' last Tuesday, with acting that was just... OK. Acting in 'Blade Runner 2049' is on a different level.Cinematography/Sound: The original Blade Runner set a high bar. Its world is instantly recognizable. The world built by Blade Runner 2049's presentation of color, sound, detail, and motion met (or even exceed) that bar.I have a very short list of movies I would willingly watch again. Blade Runner 2049 makes that list.",10,1,5,23 December 2017
