Scarface," A fantastic journey
","This movie is simply an epic masterpiece. It is one of those films that will be remembered and imitated for years to come, it has a huge following still, over twenty years later and has influenced some of the greatest movies since then. Al Pacino gives an Oscar worthy performance as Tony Montana, a determined and streetwise Cuban immigrant who overcomes several obstacles to reach the level of success that he has by the end of the movie. Al Pacino is loud and intense in this movie, displaying one of the most famous accents in movie history, and he does it masterfully. The supporting cast is very talented, with Steven Bauer as his right hand man and best friend.The overall feel to this movie is extremely dramatic, some could say over the top. It is this aspect of it that makes it so great, as it deals with a larger-than-life character and his amazing journey from rags to riches.This movie is one of those movies that everyone should see, love it or hate it one has to admit that it is epic to watch.",9,1,2,25 October 2004
