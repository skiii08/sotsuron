Ford v Ferrari," The most entertaining film you'll see this year.
","Every year there is a film that has a little bit of everything to please anyone out there. A film that has heart, passion for a craft, strong performers, dreams that become reality - a film worth watching on the big screen, that keeps you entertained for 150 minutes. Well, Ford v Ferrari is that film.American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale) battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car race in endurance racing, in 1966.Shelby and Miles aren't doing this for fame or the prize at the end of the finish line, they do it because they love racing, building something from scratch and making it even better than ever thought possible. That's where the heart of this film lies. Just like those guys, you can tell director James Mangold and his team made this film with a passion for filmmaking. From production design, to camera movements in- and outside the race cars, to the attention to detail when it comes to costume design and historic accuracy. A true feat for Hollywood and for cinema goers worldwide.20th Century Fox/Disney does seem to want to attract an audience that's interested in cars and racing, but this film is more than just that. It's about business and family, the message this film tells without any hesitance is universal and will keep everyone intrigued for its entire two and a half hour runtime. There's never a dull moment in this what might seem boring on paper event-film. Even the longest dialogues are riddled with Bale's over-the-top face acting and writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller made sure to have serious conversations supercharged with dry humour. Bale proves how much of an acting-chameleon he is - I've never seen him do anything like this before. Even Damon, who I'm personally not the biggest fan of, since I find him very one-note, deserves my recognition as being simply incredible as Bale's on screen 'co-driver'.The supporting cast might not be filled with household Hollywood names, but this cast is without a doubt one of the best ensembles you'll see all year. Noah Jupe (A Quiet Place) and Caitriona Balfe (Outlander) as Miles' son and wife will have many viewers look up their names. Jupe has a joyful screen presence that makes you want to protect him at all costs, while Balfe stands her ground with her mesmerising charisma. Her chemistry with Bale feels so naturally intimate, as if they're a married couple in real life - I found myself smiling every time they interacted with each other - magical! Jon Bernthal, Tracy Letts and Remo Girone each give compelling performances in every scene they bump and run.Although I said this wasn't just a movie about racing, it does have the most spectacular race sequences I've seen in years, thanks to Phedon Papamichael's off the charts cinematography, flawless VFX and the amazing sound design team. Following the cars on ground level in hair clip turns is sweat inducing and will have you gasping for clean air when stuff completely goes wrong. There's never a moment you won't believe it's not Bale himself who sits behind the wheel.Ford v Ferrari is the kind of movie everyone will enjoy. It has big Hollywood stars telling a timeless story about friendship and making dreams come true. In a year, full of sequels and remakes, what more do you want? This is one of the most entertaining films you'll see this year.",10,19,46,11 November 2019
Knives Out," A hoot of a film!
","Rian Johnson's ('Star Wars: The Last Jedi') ensemble juggernaut 'Knives Out' is a cutting edge whodunnit with lots of witty one-liners and twists, an underlying political sneer at modern America, and first-rate actors that will both shock and surprise you.As soon as the classical music kicks in with the murder scene draped in fog, you know this is going to be a unique watch for 2019 audiences. What seems to have been a suicide, suddenly becomes a murder investigation on the death of renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), as more and more testimonies don't line up, and private detective Blanc (Daniel Craig) and Lieutenant Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) suspect foul play. A classic murder mystery turns into a contemporary case of Cluedo that keeps the twists coming, even when it seems like the main secret has been revealed in the first act. When more skeletons seem hidden within Thrombey's manor and his dysfunctional family, that's when the fun really begins.Johnson most recently directed the hated-by-a-huge-percentage-of-fanboys 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (which I personally adore!), but isn't holding back on his writing skills. As a matter of fact, it seems like he's even louder than ever and that truly pays off. His construction and build up of tension and suspense is astounding. Most of 'Knives Out' takes place in the enormous mansion, which by the way has some of the craziest production design I've seen all year, yet Johnson takes the story far beyond the mansion on a few occasions to bump into the clues the main suspect has been trying to hide from everyone involved.The cast is stupendously incredible. Rambling up such a mix of well known talents with exciting new faces, is a genius combo. Front and centre stands Cuban actress Ana de Armas ('Blade Runner 2049'), as Mr. Harlan Thrombey's caretaker. Showcasing a range of emotions throughout the film, she's certainly the strongest of the cast and an exciting talent that will most definitely have people talking. The caring and emotional Marta Cabrera, is a unique character I haven't seen in a film of this calibre for a while. Her innocent persona evolves through all stages of grief, showing she has a heart while most of the late Mr. Thrombey's family members are vultures with no shame. Johnson has proven many times before how to flesh out his characters, and has done it again.Daniel Craig ('Spectre') and Toni Collette ('Hereditary') surprise as on screen comic relief. It's refreshing to see Craig, who's best known for James Bond, take a different route in his career to prove he's not a one-trick pony. Collette, who at one point channels her Hereditary dinner rant, is a camp riot as daughter-in-law Joni. Everyone is great in their own part, just Jaeden Martell ('It') felt more like a minor plot device and has no place in the whole of the story.'Knives Out' is a hoot of a film! Cuts right into the action and slices through two hours of giggles, shocks and spins. This might not be for everyone, Johnson has quite the outspoken opinion on racism, political standpoints and what's right and wrong, and might challenge those who don't agree with a more evolved point of view on humanity. The film is most of all engaging, and Johnson is just the right guy to make one the most entertaining films of the year.Originally published on into:screens",8,5,21,26 November 2019
The Irishman," Prodigious and astonishing, but not without flaws.
","The Irishman is supposed to be THE film for Netflix. With a $160 million budget and this year's most wanted de-aging technique (ref. Gemini Man), legendary director Martin Scorsese's long awaited new film has a lot of eyes and hungry fans to please. It's definitely made to be seen on a streaming platform, but with a 209 minute runtime, will this be a hit for Netflix?A mob hitman, Frank 'The Irishman' Sheeran (Robert De Niro), is a man with a lot on his mind. The former labor union high official and hitman, learned to kill serving in Italy during World War II. Recalling his possible involvement with the disappearance of his life-long friend, Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Scorsese's mobster tale is a classic in the making. But it isn't flawless. The well known director makes some interesting choices to tell The Irishman's story. We see old Frank in a retirement home, sharing the events of his life with the audience, just like grandpa used to do when visiting on a Sunday afternoon. We go back and forth in time, sometimes up to 40 years back. With the use of de-aging VFX, we see De Niro and co.'s faces through an Instagram-filter, to make them look 40 years younger. It's not a bad technique of visual effects, and it's important to tell the story, but it doesn't work as well as you'd hope it would. Especially in the very first scene, you notice how flawed the technique is when wrinkles are ironed out of Pesci and De Niro's faces, yet when zooming in on their hands you can clearly tell their real age.Blue-contacts-wearing De Niro, gives a typical calm and collected De Niro-performance. He's a good actor, and his more nuanced work in this film is near the end when he gets to work with more emotional material. A very touching note to end the film on. Joe Pesci, who plays Russell Bufalino, knocks it out of the park. His comeback to the big screen is powerful, captivating and career-defining. But the one actor I didn't expect to like as much as I did, is Al Pacino. His performance as Jimmy Hoffa is both spiritual and worthy of every award coming award season. It was like as if he was possessed by the outrageous Hoffa himself - memorable and uncanny.What bothered me throughout the film, was the use of music. I don't mind a piece of music to distinguish certain parts in a story from another, especially when you're going through so many different decades, but Scorsese uses so much music here, sometimes unsuitable to what's happening on screen, it takes away the power of the event. Robbie Robertson's score however, was delightful. Steven Zaillian's screenplay, based on Charles Brandt's book 'I Heard You Paint Houses', is strong when it wants to be and reminded me of Tarantino's heavy dialogue work, but is mostly inconsistent in pacing and engagement. The film is three and a half hours long, you're going to have some slower bits, but at least hold your audience's attention. The jokes rarely land, but I'd like to say humour is subjective. I feel like some of you might absolutely love most of the script's boffolas, it just didn't land with me.The supporting cast is substantial. From under-utilised Oscar winner Anna Paquin (as Peggy Sheeran) to celebrated Hollywood star cameos such as Harvey Keitel - everyone gets a little screen time in what's already packed as it is. But a lot doesn't get discussed. The families behind these powerful leaders barely have anything to do and just sit around as extras. Although, an unrecognisable Stephen Graham makes a long lasting impression as Hoffa's nemesis, mob boss Anthony Provenzano.The Irishman is like watching a compilation of Scorsese's oeuvre. It's prodigious and astonishing, but not without flaws. This beautifully crafted film is quite small in scope compared to its running time, with perfect production design and the mighty incredible performances make it worth sitting through to the very end. The fact Scorsese decided not to release this piece of work as a mini-series, but as a full length feature film, shows confidence and a little bit of cockiness.",7,27,61,30 October 2019
The Book Thief," Several noteworthy performances
","'The Book Thief' is worth seeing for several noteworthy performances. Especially Canadian 13-year old revelation Sophie Nélisse, who plays Liesel Meminger with such empathy and charm that I can't wait for her to truly breakthrough. I thought she must've been German, because of her accent and looks, but I was proven wrong. It really was that strong of a performance Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush are great as usual. It's at times maybe a bit too dramatic and trying too hard to make everything a spectacle. Brian Percival (Downton Abbey) still did a great job directing this film.",6,0,0,12 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," An emotionally satisfying conclusion to the saga
","After more than 40 years and eight chapters of Star Wars, the Skywalker-saga comes to an end with episode IX. J.J. Abrams is back to direct this final chapter, after passing the torch to Rian Johnson in 2017, who divided the fandom with his 'The Last Jedi'. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic conclusion to the saga, which will please many fans and brings back familiar faces, to join forces in the battle against former Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who's back from the dead.The surviving Resistance faces the First Order, while Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) will stop at nothing and travels all over the galaxy to find Rey (Daisy Ridley), who's only getting stronger and becomes an undisputed threat when slowly uncovering the truth behind her parents' deaths, conflicted between good and evil.J.J. Abrams (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) has a very distinctive style of directing, using his trademark flare in one too many scenes, though he knows like no other how to direct mind-blowing action sequences - such as a lightsaber collision in the middle of the ocean, with enormous waves crashing into the ruins of the destroyed Death Star. Tying loose ends of the final trilogy's previous chapters, he services established Star Wars-fans and tugs at plenty of heartstrings, since all bets are off in the final instalment. Tears are never far off, when well known characters make a final appearance, while new and beloved characters say farewell, finally embracing their destiny.What's truly remarkable is how much the chemistry of this new generation of characters has developed over the course of three episodes. Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega's comedic timing and bantering on screen is focused and refined to perfection. While Carrie Fisher gets top billing, her Leia Organa has the smallest amount of screen time, after her passing right before filming commenced. The use of older footage of her doesn't go unnoticed, when there's clearly almost no dialogue that could've been used, and her character just stands in the distance without ever really interacting with anyone else.The production design is amazing. The different planets and inventiveness of new worlds are awe-inspiring, from dangerously snowy alleyways reminiscent and breathing the style of 'The Mandalorian', to desert landscapes, in which a colourful tribe celebrates an age-old tradition with joyful music, and magnificent animatronics and puppets are used for realistic effect. The visual effects of Lucasfilm are (as usual) out of this world, but big set pieces that remind you of other sagas, such as 'The Lord of the Rings'-trilogy, do look a bit 'videogame-y', when a budget this big - $200,000,000 to be precise - can provide better graphics and even real life sets to give a more polished look to very important and grandiose scenes. John Williams' score brings life and emotion to everything on screen, re-mastering and re-inventing previously used themes and blending them with new and iconic tunes, specific to his sound.With Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the Skywalker-saga reaches for the stars, concluding a historic piece of storytelling, with its own highs and lows, for future generations to explore and embrace the legendary pop culture phenomenon that is 'Star Wars'.",8,0,4,21 December 2019
Apocalypse Now," The version Coppola always wanted to make
","I'm going to be honest here for a second and let you know, I've never watched the original. Watching Apocalypse Now: Final Cut - the version director Francis Ford Coppola always wanted to make - seemed to be a great opportunity for me to experience this classic on the big screen.This year marks the 40th anniversary of Apocalypse Now. Rereleased in 2001 as 'Redux'-version, 'Final Cut' cuts down to a three hour running time and uses state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos sound and crystal clear 4k restored imagery. Every scene got polished and feels and looks like a new film. Coppola seems to be saying goodbye to his magnum opus with this final cut, showing us exactly the way he wanted Apocalypse Now to look like in the first place.The opening shot of palm trees turning into ashes, to the sound of The Doors' 'The End' is burned into my mind. Just beautiful in every way. This image might not look as hi-def as you'd hope for in the final cut, but this has to do with the way it was shot on celluloid. Nonetheless, gives you an idea what awaits you. Helicopters and motel-room ceiling fans edited in a way that it overlaps, shows how affected Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is by this war - PTSD shown in the most artistic way.Where the first two acts are really compelling, the final act really lost me. The first two acts explore post traumatic stress syndrome and the challenges that come with it. The Vietnam war is still roaring in the background, but our main group of characters is put on a side mission upriver, to hunt down a deserter - demented colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). The Captain reads through Kurtz's files while traveling through Vietnam, danger luring around every corner and trying not to lose focus on his goal. This war changed many men forever. Coppola and his team show the insanity in the jungle and trenches, while these soldiers have nothing else to lose than their minds.The final act starts with a very strange scene at a plantation that has nothing to add to the story. Here we get seated around a dinner table with French colonialists discussing politics, that seems to go on forever. To then move further down the river to introduce Brando's character in a cultish way. This third act feels like a different film and to me was very anti-climactic. That doesn't mean this film isn't a masterpiece, because the work and practical effects put into the making of this is simply astonishing. Watching Robert Duvall act for his life, was jaw-dropping and made me smile every time he appeared on screen.I've never seen anything like Apocalypse Now: Final Cut before, and I don't think I'll ever see anything like this ever again. StudioCanal decided to distribute this new version in Australia. If you get the chance to watch this on the big screen from Thursday July 25 (in selected cinemas), please do, you won't regret it!",8,3,11,23 July 2019
Yesterday," Interesting concept can't save ordinary story.
","What if a global power outage caused you to get hit by a bus in the dark, and you wake up discovering there's no sign of anything The Beatles have ever accomplished?
There was a time when Danny Boyle was a director who's projects were considered edgy and each one of them had their own style. What if just like in Yesterday, he all of a sudden forgot about his previous work and decided to work with screenwriter Richard Curtis (Love, Actually) to makes the most dull film we've ever seen of him? Well, that scenario doesn't seem too crazy..'Yesterday' stars Himesh Patel (Eastenders) and the usually very energetic Lily James (Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again) to play a struggling singer-songwriter and his manager/love interest - yet Patel's character is completely clueless to the moves she makes.
Jack Malik (Patel) is ready to give up his dying career as a wannabe singer, when he gets knocked down by a bus in the middle of a global electricity outage. He wakes up in the hospital and soon finds out nobody has ever heard of the legendary band The Beatles (as well as some other brands/objects, which is clearly a perfect opportunity for the filmmakers to incorporate plenty of product placement.. Michael Bay would be proud.).When Jack sees an opportunity to make bank, he knows just the way how to get people's attention by writing down the lyrics of every song The Beatles have ever released - at least the ones he can remember. He claims to be the sole writer of these songs and after appearing on a morning show on local television, he gets discovered by Ed Sheeran and invited to accompany him on his upcoming world tour as the singer's opening act. When Sheeran's crazed agent Hannah (Kate McKinnon) approaches the rising superstar to sign him to her label, he has no idea where this rapidly progressing voyage will take him.Not only will he discover how fame can blind you from what's right in front of you, he will also learn the true meaning of the phrase 'the grass isn't always greener on the other side'. Girl-next-door Elly (James) was his rock from day one. Seeing her being pushed aside by his own greediness makes him realise what he's really been missing in life: love.
It's supposed to be a very British romantic comedy with a highly original concept that leans towards fantasy.
Yesterday could've been the sweet antidote in a world filled with sequels and blockbusters, but nothing is more disappointing than to see a well-accomplished director as Boyle screw it all up. The direction is all over the place with inter-titles and unbelievable scenes that won't fly in the world we live in right now. It is too realistic to be set in a fantasy world and the film never pulls you in completely. Even the funny one liners and McKinnon's delightful comedic punches as a stereotypical Hollywood agent, can't save how ordinary 'Yesterday' feels. And if you're really here for the music, I have to disappoint you. The few music montages are not even worth the admission, since most of the performances get cut short. Just let it be.Review by Seth Eelen for novastreamnetwork",5,35,95,24 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," We love you 3000!
","Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet, and half of all life in the universe disappeared. That's how last year's Avengers: Infinity War ended and left us craving for its epic conclusion.One year later, we are finally in the Endgame. The Russo Brothers filmed this arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe back to back and reminds us of the 'snap', as we sit down to witness what's coming. Unaware of the battle happening in Wakanda, a family is in for a surprise that will have some serious consequences. Not just for them, but for the entire universe that doesn't know how to move on.The surviving Avengers - Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle) plus brand new members Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and marvellous Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) set off on a mission to stop Thanos once and for all. Will they find Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) in time to join them on this quest? And if so, what if it all fails in the end and make things even worse?11 years and 21 films have been leading up to this chapter. Avengers: Endgame says farewell to characters that have been part of our lives for such a long time, tears are inevitable. Emotions will peak, because movie fans have sat in the backseat for such a long time and got to know these heroes as if we're part of the team. Plots will be wrapped up (even some continuity errors are being corrected, to make sure everything is correct). Everything is at stake and there is only one solution. This is it.Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script knows just how to find that balance between science, drama and action. These guys know what they're doing and find the heart in the midst of all the heroism. The battle of Wakanda was just a warm up - you ain't seen nothing yet! The Avengers and all of their friends get enough screentime to be remembered with honour or to leave an everlasting mark on all of us. Our superheroes have some extra tricks up their sleeves to keep things exciting. Every one of them gets a moment to shine and the clash we witness in the third act of Endgame is one of the most perfectly constructed and visually mesmerising war scenes you will witness - maybe, EVER! There will be laughs, you will cheer and gasp and you will definitely cry.After Endgame, there's a whole new saga to start and an entire universe to explore. But for now, let's just enjoy the finale to our Infinity Saga and take one last bow to salute them. Thank you Avengers. We love you 3000!",9,4,9,30 April 2019
Toy Story 4," A sequel that not only works as an ending, but also as a new beginning.
","The announcement of a fourth Toy Story chapter, felt like an easy cash grab for Disney, after the huge success that was the concluding Toy Story 3. After seeing the first trailer and synopsis, I still wasn't sure if this was gonna work. So being a bit cautious of seeing these beloved characters coming back nine years after we said goodbye to Andy, I can say - no need to be afraid. The toys are dusted off and look better than ever!The film opens with a flashback to a rainy night where our toys are still happily living with Andy. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Bo Peep (Annie Potts) are getting ready to rescue RC-racer - a radio-controlled toy car - that's been stuck in a gutter and is about to be dragged into the sewers, if not saved in time. This is an exciting opening to get you right into the story and remind you of the bond these toys have with each other. 'No toy gets left behind', like Woody would say multiple times throughout this franchise. This scene also shows how close Woody and Bo's relationship just was, which gets torn apart moments later when the lamp that houses her and her sheep is given away.Almost a decade later, after Andy has passed his beloved toys to young Bonnie, we see her playing with all of them, although Woody gets pushed aside more often as time passes. He gets left in the closet with some of her baby toys. But when Bonnie has to attend her orientation day for kindergarten, Woody sees an opportunity to sneak into her backpack to look after the nervous girl. In class, a selfish kid grabs Bonnie's art supplies and drops some in a bin, where Woody jumps in to save some of it - along with bits of rubbish - which leads to Bonnie creating Forky (soon discovered to be a toy, voiced by Tony Hale), a spork with popsicle-stick feet, googly eyes and pipe-cleaner arms. The family has a new member.Bonnie adores Forky, but having an existential crisis, this spork knows it's trash and feels like his only destination is the trash can, his safe haven. Woody, so longing for a purpose, takes it upon himself to keep rescuing and returning Forky, which will only get harder when Bonnie and her parents embark on a road trip in an RV. A journey on which we will meet carnival toys (Ducky and Bunny - voiced by Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele), a Canadian stunt-motocross action figure (Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom - the coolest and most breathtaking toy ever created) and a manipulative vintage doll (Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby) who's stuck living in an antique store, ready to do whatever's needed to live a blissful life.
The emotions run high, with stunning animation and imagery all around. New characters that will win over your heart and make you laugh out loud with the funniest one liners. Did I really expect anything less, after three exceptionally strong films in this franchise?! Shame on me.Toy Story 4 is an adventure full of subtle messages and metaphors, that carries on the legacy of its original trilogy. Disney/Pixar has done it again - a sequel that not only works as an ending, but also as a new beginning. When we get to chapter 5 (because let's be real, this is gonna kill it at the worldwide box office), these characters will have seen so much more than just the walls of Andy/Bonnie's room and have experienced what 'letting go' really means.",10,297,519,18 June 2019
Aladdin," A whole new world, maybe... A better world? Not really!
","Another year, another live-action remake of a Disney Classic. After global billion dollar box office-hit Beauty and the Beast, it didn't take long for Disney to announce another '90s animation was getting the treatment. Aladdin was released back in 1992, made history as being the first animated feature ever to gross more than $500 million and it was also the most successful film that year! This lead to numerous sequels and tv-shows, until now.British director Guy Ritchie (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) is a bold choice to direct a musical, since he's better known for his more gritty comedies. But maybe we've been missing out on a hidden talent of his.. or maybe not! This is Ritchie's most ambitious project so far, and it will all depend on the success of Aladdin, if he'll ever get an opportunity like this again.First of all, Aladdin has gained quite the fanbase over two generations of kids. So there's the nostalgia of the animated version they'll have to compete with. Second, a lot of media had reported on early set pictures that made everything look a bit too much Bollywood instead of keeping it more Middle Eastern. Was this project doomed from the start?Going in with the lowest of expectations, might be the best chance this movie has to win over audiences. Aladdin is more of a 'retelling' of the animated feature, co-written by Guy Ritchie himself. There are of course some similarities with the tale we're all familiar with, and this could cause for some fans to leave the cinema empty-handed when they don't see their favourite scene making it into this live action version. The story relies the most on its comedic timing in some of the dialogue to distract people from the horrid CGI that blurs the screen more than 80% of the time. You can also tell Ritchie is inexperienced in this genre and interrupts big musical dance scenes (who are by the way, clumsy in every way) with unnecessary comedic moments that then feels forced.The other co-writer is John August (Dark Shadows), who was able to help flesh out Jasmine (Naomi Scott) a bit more, as she wants to become the next ruler of Agrabah. Another character that wants to steal the spotlight - but fails miserably - is Jafar (Marwan Kenzari). He's too one-dimensional to come across as a threat and let's be honest, not every cosplayer is an actor. Jasmine on the other hand is here to be shown as more than just a princess waiting to marry a prince. Scott sings two new 'female empowering pop ballads' (written by The Greatest Showman song writers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) and is the true MVP of the entire film. She delivers the looks, has the acting (AND singing!) chops and commands your attention whenever appearing on screen.Mena Massoud plays Aladdin, a humble thief turning into a hero. His chemistry with Scott is very natural. Will Smith is the one who everyone was so afraid of, to be portraying Genie, largely due to Robin Williams' memorable vocal performance. He's more known as a rapper, not a singer, but he makes this role his own, instead of trying to duplicate the animated version of his character. He delivers a distressed and comedic sophisticated Genie with a certain stage presence that'll make you laugh more than once. And even though you might've have thought Will Smith was painted blue, it looks like this character is almost entirely motion capture and copy-pasted into every scene. He floats on a cloudy legless lower body and looks as fake as the background.Aladdin isn't a total disappointment, but one day that game of roulette will finish with a bang and end the cow that is 'Disney Classics'. Leave a classic as it is, it'll never be as good.",5,31,86,22 May 2019
1917," A technical masterpiece
","Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still a young lad. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.Roger Deakins' (Blade Runner 2049) cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's (Passengers) score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Chapman (Game of Thrones) do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Mark Strong (Shazam!), Richard Madden (Rocketman) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange) are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes.",8,210,352,6 December 2019
Midsommar," Ambitious, unsettling and trippy.
","Ari Aster's follow-up to his surprise hit Hereditary, once again deals with grief. This time not so much in a supernatural way, but a more ritualistic one up north in Sweden. In Midsommar, Dani (Florence Pugh) tries to overcome an unthinkable family tragedy. Her rocky relationship with Christian (Jack Reynor) was about to completely fall apart, but when they decide to join his college buddies on an ill-considered trip to a remote commune in Sweden, that's when everything truly gets put in perspective.Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) invites his fellow grad students to his former community under a midnight sun. Folk horror and tradition lean against outdated superstition. Our American group of friends doesn't really fit in with these white robed, strangely calm Swedes. From their arrival, their destiny has been forebode in the illustrations and paintings on the wooden walls of the community's cabins. Without really paying attention to it, these guests have signed up for a one-way journey to death.Lots of clues and unnecessary imagery get scattered throughout the film. Nothing ever gets an explanation, it's just there. As if the director expects audiences to know about runes and most of all, why there's a bear in a cage that no one really addresses. Aster mostly succeeds in keeping the eeriness steady yet flowing throughout the entire film. His Hereditary cinematographer, Pawel Pogorzelski, is once again gifting us with extraordinary imagery that is unique on screen. While his previous film had lots of nightly shots, Midsommar takes place in broad daylight. The pastels and soft lighting give a really soothing look, that is unknown to this genre.The acting overall is strong, with Pugh being a standout. After watching her in Fighting With My Family earlier this year and soon to be seen again in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Little Women, one can definitely say - 2019 is the year of the Pugh. Her Dani makes you feel for her loss and she owns the screen. Reynor is a pretty new face for me, but I'm curious to see him take more challenging roles like this, where he gets to shine and push himself even more.Midsommar is nonetheless entertaining. Its first two acts are interesting and you want to see where this is going. The final act feels a bit stretched at a certain point and could've used a bigger punch when everything sizzles down at the end. As for the characters, it's a bit too unrealistic to see them all just go along with everything without asking the real question - 'what is going on?'. By the time this question does get asked, it's already too late and we're closer to our somewhat underwhelming finale. Midsommar is ambitious, unsettling and trippy. Can't wait to see where Ari Aster takes us next.",7,1,3,8 August 2019
Joker," Why so serious?
","Everyone who knows Batman, knows Joker. To many, the most well known villain in comic book history. He's been portrayed many times on television and in films, even resulting in a posthumous Academy Award for Heath Ledger's performance in 2009's The Dark Knight. What if we break the trend of franchises, by stepping away from it and giving a universally known character his standalone film?Todd Phillips' (The Hangover-trilogy) Joker shows us who Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) really is. What/who drove him in becoming 'Joker'? A complete character study of a mentally ill adult, who still lives with his mother, Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy). Working as a clown to promote goods on the street, or to lift sick children's spirits at the hospital, his real goal in life is to become a successful comedian. When things don't exactly work out the way he wants and society mentally abuses him more than once, Arthur snaps at a certain point and realises there's no turning back.Joaquin Phoenix in his own vision of a villain so beloved and disturbing as Joker, gave me a bit of a deja-vu feeling. I've seen Phoenix play challenging roles before, and only in the third act I actually found him compelling enough as Joker. This partially has something to do with the script. Phillips' and Scott Silver's (The Fighter) pretentious writing isn't going deep enough to make us feel anything for the character. It's mostly sloppy and repetitive, with one too many subplots and side characters. One of those supporting characters is Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz - 'Deadpool 2'), one of Arthur's neighbours who seems to connect with him in a certain way. But nothing is what it seems. It felt like her character was written into the story to underline a certain wrinkle in Arthur's mind, which cheapened the film a bit and felt unnecessary. Most of the supporting cast was great with the little amount of dialogue provided, but was mostly wasted. This is a one man show after all.Watching this in 70mm, really worked in favour of the '70s-vibe cinematographer Lawrence Sher (Godzilla II) was going for. The production and costume design was simple but effective, to help achieve that aesthetic. Hildur Guðnadóttir's grandiose (Chernobyl) score drums out all the non-existent applause of Arthur's audience. Despite some major flaws, Joker had me glued to the screen from the moment his bone chilling maniacal laughter filled the room, until the end credits rolled over that same echoing tittering. Why so serious?",9,1,3,3 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A frightening yet touching story of forgotten friendship and lost opportunities.
","The sequel to the 2017 box office success 'It' starts exactly where it left off. Almost no explanatory flashbacks to the situations the Losers Club got themselves into, fighting the terrifying Pennywise. Only difference in 'It Chapter Two' - they're all grown up and ready to end It, once and for all.27 years ago, a fear-indulging creature tried to feast on every teenager alive in small town Derry. A group of friends, defeated the being (disguised as a clown) and moved on with their lives. Or so we think.. After a brutal killing one evening, Mike (Isaiah Mustafa) decides to call every single one of his old friends, begging them to come back to their hometown. Barely remembering the events of almost three decades ago, they catch up over dinner and drinks and memories start to flow back. Sooner than they'd expect, It strikes again and the returning members of the Losers Club feel betrayed by Mike, luring them in knowing well enough they'd have to fight their common enemy once again. Mike did a whole lot of research to figure out It's origin and also knows how to defeat this being. But our group of friends has to stick together to successfully finish this fight against evil.Andy Muschietti is back to direct the second chapter to the well known Stephen King novel. It seems like he grew up, just like the Losers Club did. The jokes matured, as did certain subjects within the story (domestic abuse, sexual orientation..). Another impressive note is Benjamin Wallfisch's score. Simply eerie and unsettling. While I thought his score for 'It' was a bit bland and boring to listen to without the visuals, he decides to go bigger and bolder in this film and it really pays off.The movie has a lot of inventive sequences, which sometimes will blow your mind in how well constructed they are. A few of them are re-used from the previous chapter, but in a different and more terrifying way. The production design is next level perfect. While I thought 'It' relied heavier on jump scares, Chapter Two uses them less. There are still quite a few of them that actually work, but they don't seem as forced as the ones that came before. Whenever a new CGI-monster comes along, you simply ask yourself who designed these creatures. Some are straight up nightmare fuel.For fans of the younger cast, don't worry, they are still present through the use of flashbacks. But the focus is all on the adult versions this time. The true standout is by far Bill Hader, who plays grown up Richie - an alcoholic stand up comedian with a secret he can't seem to express to the outside world. His acting and comedic timing breaks some of the horror-tension, but never in a way it becomes annoying. He's genuinely enjoyable to watch and has an emotional arc to feel for. Other surprisingly great performances come from James Ransone (grown up Eddie) and Jessica Chastain (adult Beverly). James McAvoy (adult Bill) isn't bad, but it seems like he's playing one of his personalities from Split/Glass, with his accent being a bit too thick and an over-the-top lisp. While Mustafa, Jay Ryan (Ben) and Andy Bean (Stanley) just didn't get enough screen time to be rememberable. Bill Skarsgard is back as Pennywise, and while I thought he was brilliant in 'It', I kept wondering how much CGI they used to put him in this film. It became quite distracting, especially in the second half.It Chapter Two is the better half of the story, which explores the very interesting origin of this evolving menacing force and shows the devastating consequences of its wrongdoings towards a group of children. It not only shows that it's okay to be a loser or someone that doesn't entirely fit in to today's society, it makes us think of what we are capable of by just believing in ourselves. A frightening yet touching story of forgotten friendship and lost opportunities.",8,7,11,8 September 2019
Parasite," Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face.
","After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, the French Oscars let's say, Sydney Film Festival was quick to reel in that line and get Parasite to screen at multiple sold out venues around the city. At the end of the festival, the film got awarded the biggest price (Best Film) and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film, releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas.Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sick) is a young man with not much to look forward to. He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), snappy mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) and his clever sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults. They use free wi-fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company, until Ki-woo's friend offers him to take over a student to tutor.Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory, Ki-woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you've ever seen. Here he becomes the tutor to Da-hye (Ziso Jung), daughter of wealthy CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Everything seems to go just as planned, until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control.Scriptwriters Bong Joon-ho (who also directed) and Han Jin-won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well-written film you'll see this year. Every line gets delivered so smoothly, as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story, with Jung Jae-il's classical score, masterfully playing in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment, to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters. This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way, to make it even clearer that they don't belong in the same world. Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before.Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties, the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences. Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals, but being nice doesn't take that much effort. The film focuses on poverty, desperation and what we are willing to do to take what should be ours. Tension between upperclass elegance and underground threat has never been more in your face. Bong (Okja) always loves to blur the lines of genre and he makes sure he hits every step on the staircase, to succeed in his efforts.Parasite is a mite that doesn't discriminate and will get under every moviegoer's skin, no matter what background you come from. The power of this story, is found in the way comedy and drama rub each other in just the right way to spark a bit of thriller, that flips over into pure horror when despair and hate meet each other. This is one infestation you can't get rid off.",10,51,101,30 June 2019
Marriage Story," No cheek will be left dry.
","With many directors, producers and actors blaming Netflix and other streaming services for what could end up being the end of cinema as we know, the streaming service is releasing several films in theatres for a number of weeks to be eligible for consideration during awards season. Many theatres are boycotting this strategy, so aren't playing Netflix's films at all. The theatres in mostly bigger cities around the world that do play them , are selling tickets like hotcakes. After their short theatrical run, Netflix will make their Original Film available for their members. With Marriage Story, Netflix might even get their first Best Picture award handed over to them.Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story is an incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. While we flash through important and daily situations, we hear Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) explain what she loves about her husband Charlie (Adam Driver). Charlie loves being a dad, and how it's almost annoying how much he loves it. He cries easily in movies. He's very competitive, undaunted and is very clear about what he wants. These are only a few things Nicole loves about him. After that, it's Charlie's turn to tell us what he loves about his wife Nicole. She's a great dancer - infectious. She's a mother who plays, really plays. She gives great presents. While we hear this couple recite what they've written down, we get to meet them post-break-up in a marriage mediator's office. This was part of an assignment, to fully understand why they got married in the first place. Nicole doesn't want to hear what Charlie has written down, so what's been put in writing is only something we, as the audience, get to hear out loud.What follows then is an emotionally raw journey into growing up, while trying to figure out how to survive on your own. Happiness is a personal feeling and can't be disguised as something as trivial as washing dishes or forgetting a grocery list on your way to the supermarket. We get to know little about Charlie's childhood, but Nicole's family and home are something that's right in the middle of everything. There's also their son Henry (Azhy Robertson), who gets pulled into this. Nicole thinks Henry is just like his father - almost joined to the hip. But when their marriage crumbles, and distance becomes an important factor in Henry's upbringing, their assumptions are solely things that have been witnessed while being together, and are now changing rapidly.The change in personality, after splitting up and having to deal with divorce, becomes very clear in both Nicole and Charlie's behaviour. While Nicole seems very focused, meek and motherly, she turns into a woman who knows what she wants and isn't holding back anymore. The only thing she's holding back in front of Charlie - are tears. As if she doesn't want him to see how vulnerable and damaged she is by everything that's changing. 'Love doesn't make sense', and no truer words have ever been spoken. Charlie on the other hand, who's always been confident and career driven, is now crumbling down, defeated and uncertain of the future.The cast is phenomenal. Adam Driver is the strongest of the bunch - a transformative, unseen, heartbreaking performance that no one will be able to shut up about during this year's awards season, and deservedly so. Everyone is feeding off his energy and bringing their triple A-game to this truly exceptional film. Scarlett Johansson has never been better, playing a broken woman who wants the best for her family but can no longer wait for her dreams to become reality. Laura Dern as Nicole's divorce attorney is Elle Woods all grown up and commands your attention. Ray Liotta in a comeback to the big screen (his last big film was in 2014's 'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For'), makes you wonder where he's been all this time. Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother don't get much screen time, but are here for some unexpectedly superb comic relief.Baumbach also wrote the film and deserves all the accolades - a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. The way he gets his cast to deliver minutes of dialogue, while his DOP, Robbie Ryan, zooms in and out, follows and swirls around them, to then play with shifting between different actor's facial expressions in silent moments, is utterly enchanting. The cherry on top is Randy Newman coming back to compose a score for a live action film (his last live action film was 2008's 'Leatherheads') - masterful!Marriage Story will get discussed in film school, years from now. It has everything to become an all time classic and will proudly get called one of the best films of the decade. A melancholic, heavy-hearted yet joyously bittersweet story about marriage and its unfortunate path to severance in order to find happiness. No cheek will be left dry.",10,553,730,4 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Unapologetically brave
","A film in which an imaginary Adolf Hitler is played by a Polynesian Jew? Only one person has the balls to pull this off. Taika Waititi's anti-hate satire makes fun of nazi-Germany and its hitlerjugend in his newest film, Jojo Rabbit. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis),a teenage boy who wants to become the best fascist there is and belong to something bigger than life, joins a youth camp that trains young boys and girls to become better Germans. The camp gets run by one-eyed Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), who spends his time sketching fabulous capes and designing new outrageously camp weapons. With him we get his loyal righthand Finkel (Alfie Allen) and his loud lefthand Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson).When Jojo tries to prove himself to the older bullish camp guide counsellors, things don't go exactly as planned and the young boy ends up wounded back home. With his face now looking like a Picasso painting - it's really not that bad - he's afraid to go out into the light of day and would rather spend his days getting pep talks from his good friend Adolf (played by Taika Waititi himself). Bright spirit Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) has other plans and pushes her son to take on the dangerous world that waits for him. But when Jojo comes home sooner than expected, he finds something every Nazi fears the most, a Jewish girl living in the walls of his home.The sweet humour seems strange when dealing with a subject matter like this, but fans of Taika's work know he's done weirder things. After critically acclaimed films such as 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' and 'Thor: Ragnarok', the New Zealand director is ready to take on awards season and does so in a very provocative but extremely balanced style. It is a satire and makes fun of bending the truth into a way it becomes enjoyable, yet the film builds up to an emotional third act that feels as bittersweet as it is heartwarming.Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story) surprises with a certain flair and joyful theatricality we haven't seen from her in a while. Not since Ghost World in 2001, has she done something this funny and edgy. It's a welcome return to form and hopefully post-'Avengers: Endgame', she keeps on track with these interesting and unique roles. Charming newcomer Roman Griffin Davis knows how to carry the entire film. This is his story, and the way Waititi wrote his character to grow over the course of almost two hours will resonate with audiences who sometimes just don't know better and take the truth for granted. His young and promising co-star Thomasin McKenzie (Leave No Trace), who plays Jewish stowaway Elsa, is perfectly synced with him. Their dialogue and emotional arc grows from Jojo asking if she sleeps upside down like a bat - because that's what Jews do - to fully embracing the fact she's human and fills a void in his family's house, which has been empty for such a long time.Composer Michael Giacchino's score is as brilliant as ever. He proves himself once again to be one of the most diverse and interesting composers in the business, bringing guitars and drums to 'Jojo's March', while a choir is angelically chanting in the background. The visually pleasing production design and use of colour in every scene is almost Wes Anderson-like, but with the heart of Taika Waititi. Jojo Rabbit is just the cheeky little film we didn't know we needed. An unapologetically brave reminder to face your fears and be resolute when speaking up against those who are wrong.",10,3,10,16 December 2019
