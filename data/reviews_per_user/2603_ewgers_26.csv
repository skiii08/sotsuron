Hereditary," Poor acting for me
","Toni Collette just never convinces as an actress
There is always an element of over acting in her performances
And this film fails because of that",1,5,14,14 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Enjoyable
","Gaga was born for performing
The acting from Bradley Cooper is superb .Some memorable music.However we know the story and it's been done better before .A lot better",7,1,1,26 October 2019
Argo," Good movie
","Some of the negative reviews on here are appalling ..Most films have political overtones nowadays .Yet reviewers feel the need to have a go at the political aspect or just USA in general .Absolute garbage .And I'm Scottish
Good firm and good story",8,0,0,26 June 2020

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Had legs but runs out of steam

The Idea of the storyline was different but sadly fails to deliver",6,1,2,19 December 2018
North by Northwest," Nothing special now
",Vertigo and James Stewart is far better .I really think this movie is over rated .Enjoyable but no more than a 7 for me,7,1,1,20 November 2019
Doctor Zhivago," Epic movie but overrated
","Yes this is an epic movie in length .You need to pinch yourself to stay awake at times .It is so long .Reminds me of Laurence of Arabia .Just too long .
Beautifully shot and quite clearly a classic
I won't be watching it again though",7,0,2,22 November 2019
Jackie," Quite boring actually
","Natalie Portman is the only actor that makes this remotely watchable
After reading the reviews ..I had high hopes
I was always fascinated about the Kennedy killing in 63 .This is very over rated movie IMO",4,0,1,20 October 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Incredible cast
","Such good acting on show from so many wonderful Actors
Sadly it doesn't even come close to being riveting or even enjoyable.
It's a bore fest
Such a damn shame as it could have been so much better with this wonderful cast",5,0,1,13 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It's just nearly a 10
","Just seen this movie for first time last night .mmm
Seen the reviews .Mmmm Surprising .
This film is enjoyable but doesn't hit the mark for me .
I just didn't think it worked, recreating history .Almost an insult to all the people that died and lived through the real life events .
'Helter Scelter' 2004 does it justice and so much better .
This is the romantic version .The way we would have loved it to have been back in 1969 .
Brad is very good and entertaining as Cliff Booth.Good acting by the others .However the story isn't nearly interesting enough .Although clearly intertwined into the fabric of the real events from that year .
The scenery is just beautifully indulgent .I loved the version of Mamas and Papas .' California dreamin ' Just beautiful
I wanted to love this movie so much as I'm a massive fan of Sharon Tate ,the tragic
story that has touched me for life .So I will probably watch it again .
If you are reading this .You may also care to view my tribute to Sharon on YouTube .

Many thanks",7,1,1,15 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," So many liers doing reviews
","I was at the cinema the other night to watch this
Not one person left the building .The film is probably not for everyone Just too many people doing reviews and telling lies .Do not believe any of these people that say ,they left early .That is pathetic",7,3,8,18 August 2019
Rules of Engagement," Very enjoyable movie
","Superb performances from great cast
This one is well worth watching .Even in 2019",8,0,2,4 December 2019
Once Upon a Time in America," Very mundane movie
","Was expecting so much more from this .
In the end .I felt uniterested .Just not that great to be honest
I can understand why it would divide opinion
Not a winner for me",7,0,2,1 September 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," Worst Tom cruise movie
","Absolute pile of rubbish
Surely the worst film Tom Cruise has ever been part of",3,1,9,25 December 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Mindblowingly superb
","Too many snowflakes.Probably Asian writing reviews for this movie .
it is simply superb .Just a pity the evil strd wasn't given the full Jack Bauer treatment just before he was executed for his evil deeds
Engrossing true story",10,3,8,26 November 2019
Joker," Disturbing in the extreme
","There is no better actor in the world before Joequin Phoenix .Just none
Sadly this film just glorifies disturbing behaviour in the extreme .
Not an enjoyable watch ' although no criticism of the acting
JP is outstanding as per usual",6,3,18,8 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," Classic movie maybe but overrated
","The acting all round was believable and superb.
I can't say the story was so impressive although the sentiment behind the film clearly was",7,1,2,15 February 2019
Shooter," Superb movie
","I'm amazed this only scores a 7.2 after all these years
You would struggle to find a better movie to watch
Mark Wahlberg is simply brilliant",10,0,1,21 March 2019
The Queen," Politically motivated crap
","Absolutely scandalously political movie .Clearly 100% anti Royal and slanted towards a repulsive murdering ,labour prime minister Anthony Blair .The reason Scotland is corrupt is down to this man and John Reid
It's more about Diana's death than actually anything The queen and our Royal family have done for Britain .Which in itself a disgrace and naming the film 'the queen '
Shame on the actors that participated in this",2,1,2,27 December 2019
Mother!," Bizarre movie
","Surely there can't be a woman out there so utterly pathetic
Jennifer Lawrence made me dislike her so much in this movie",5,0,1,18 April 2019
Green Book," Lovely movie
","Great acting , great sentiment and lots of laughs
You will enjoy this one",10,1,3,22 December 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," More gripping than the first
","How did he get from Italy, back to the USA with same suit on and shot to bitsðŸ¤”
Fantastic movie however
Keanu and old veteran actor Ian McShane shine in this .",8,2,3,18 April 2020
The Fighter," Adams,Bale and Wahlberg great acting
","Is it me .Or does every hero have to be someone from Eeeeeland 
Decent performances from Bale ,Wahlberg and the terrific Amy Adams 
Predictable storyline .Decent watch because of the cast",6,0,0,21 September 2018
