Deja Vu," SPOILER WARNING......Correct me if I'm wrong..
","I don't remember any dejavous happening to any of them throughout the film. Am I wrong? Did I miss something? Seeing something when he is in the past that he remembers seeing in the future, such as the bloodied rags and so forth in her apartment is not dejavous it's him realising that he was the one who left said rags and so forth in her apartment, nor is him asking if they've met before at the end. So how is this movie all about 'solving the mystery of dejavous' as it states in the trailer? For a take your brain out film it was pretty enjoyable although the beginning sickened me to the point that I almost walked out. It went downhill quite a bit for me with the looking into the past technology hullabaloo though once I watched on for a few minutes I got over it. Would see it again definitely.",Null,0,1,19 January 2007
