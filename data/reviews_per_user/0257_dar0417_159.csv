Darkest Hour," For the History Buff

The Irishman," Very Long
",Everyone is saying this film was way to long and I do agree with them. The de-aging did not work since all it did was remove the wrinkles in the old men. It was nice to see Pesci back again.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Everything you would expect
",First film I saw in 4DX and it might be the last. Getting water splashed on your face and gust of winds do not seem like something extra to pay for when you watch a film. Over all the film was what I would have expected not being a huge Star Wars fan. I however enjoyed seeing Carrie Fisher brought back to life for one last film. For the big Star War fans I am sure they will love the final of this trilogy.,6,0,6,15 January 2020

",Another movie everyone in the world loves. I get it they need to get the disk and save everyone.,4,1,2,23 January 2020
Dunkirk," What elese to expect from Nolan
","The film was made by the score that put you right into the war with the actors playing the roles. I wish this had more of a story then trying just to get as many people out of Dunkirk as possible. The 3 different story lines (air, water and land) made the film a lot different then any other war film you can watch. This was Nolan's way of putting you into the war.

The Conjuring 2," Another okay horror movie.

Jackie," Excellent portrait of the aftermath of Nov. 22 1963

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Everything going for it but fell short
","Solid look in the late 60s' film scene with great acting, dialog, cinematography, humor, action and more. The biggest issue with the film was the lack of story and the huge build up that you are waiting to see. One of the rare Tarantino films I will not be watching again.",6,6,13,30 July 2019

A Quiet Place," The best film of 2018.

La La Land," Better than just a musical
",Was expecting another boring musical but it turns out that La La Land was a good romantic drama/ comedy. This film had great acting and cinematography.

It Chapter Two," Great follow up

Marriage Story," Getting some great reviews
",This film was enjoyable and very depressing as most reviews would say. This film is about the aftermath of a marriage and not a story about a marriage. The acting is brilliant and the story is entertaining. If you have ever lived through a divorce this film would a lot more impactful to the viewer. I have not but watching this is just a 2 plus hour argument of a divorcing couple. The acting and story felt very authentic with the help of the two leads. In the end the two main characters did not really change and during the course of the film the viewer had no idea who to root for. They both like everyone in the world had flaws with ups and downs but in the end after it all the conclusion was to just spend all their money to fight for their son. Where two fight for their son or just ego? I guess that is for the audience to figure out.,6,0,0,4 February 2020

Black Panther," Okay Marvel comic book film but a little to political

The Purge," Great concept
",Great concept and some good horror scenes but at 90 min it fell short. This film should have been longer and had more character development. I am still wanting to know who these people are Purging and why? I am sure all these questions will be answered in 5 direct to video sequel this film will get. This looks like another 'Butterfly Effect'.,6,0,0,12 February 2020
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The shock factor and originality is gone.

Deadpool," Finally an R rated one that focus on a life of a super hero
",Best comic movie in a long time. Finally an R rated one that focus on a life of a super hero rather then what good they can do. Similar to Kick-Ass and probably as good.,8,0,2,23 January 2020
Kingsman: The Secret Service," ACTION and lots of it

The Nice Guys," Buddy Comedies are BACK
",Has some good raunchy moments definitely the best buddy comedy in a while. The 70's era adds a lot to the film. Gosling is spot on with his stupid but smart mentality and Crowe plays a great tough-guy asshole perfectly. He may have been born to play that role.,7,3,4,23 January 2020
