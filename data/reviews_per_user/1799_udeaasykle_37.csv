Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Put this together with Kill Bill Volume 1 and you have yourself a winner!
","This movie is not as violent as the first one but it is somewhat more interesting. Much more dialog and much more character building. In this you get to see how Uma is trained by an old monk called Pai Mei and other stuff i wont mention because i don't want to ruin the movie experience for you. After you see this movie and put the two together you will know why i love Terantino's movies. Every single one of them. This movie is about revenge, pure and simple. The only time during this movie that i even looked at my watch was in the end when Bill and The Bride is talking to eachother... Other than that this is an excellent movie. Favorite memorable quote: Elle Driver: That's right. I killed your master. And now I'm gonna kill you, with your very own sword, which in the immediate future, will become... my sword.The Bride: Bitch, you don't have a future. I rate this movie 8/10",8,0,1,26 April 2004
Ghost," A really good movie
","Saw this on tv last night. I have seen it before but this is the kind of movie you can watch many times. My favorite part of the movie is when patrick is trying to convince Whoppi to help him by singing to her. Not only is this film funny it is also very cute and romantic. Well to be honest, it is more romantic than funny. A great date movie.",8,4,5,12 February 2004
Minority Report," I think this is a good film, and thats all i can say...
","It is kind of hard for me to write about this movie cause i think it is an ok movie. So i can't bad mouth it for 10 lines and i can't brag about it for 10 lines. If you have read any of my other reviews you will probably notice that i love the actor Peter Stormare, and he is, like always, great in this movie. But the thing that struck me while watching this on dvd was: I had the subtitles on so i wouldn't miss any of the dialog, but when Dr. Solomon Eddie talks with his wife the subtitles said: *speaks Russian* It should be pretty obvious that it is Swedish and not Russian he is speaking... Some of my friends doesn't like Tom Cruise as an actor but i am always telling them that that is because they only watch his poor movies. He is pretty good in this movie, as Detective Jon Anderton. If you haven't seen it i would recommend it. It is action packed and a thriller and sci-fi all wrapped up in one. I rate this movie 7/10",7,0,1,21 May 2004
Citizen Kane," No wonder this movie gets so high ratings
","Made in 1941, this movie is a classic and has been called the best movie ever made. That is not bad considering it was made by a 29 year old, Orson Welles. For some reason I have always put this movie aside, because people have been telling me that it is a deep movie and not to be viewed without concentration. So therefore I have always put it off, but finally I put it in the DVD player. Let me tell you, it really is a great movie. Or should I say fantastic movie? We follow Charles Foster Kane, from childhood, to his deathbed. The death scene starts the movie and you hear Kane say the word `Rosebud' and that is what the movie is about, trying to find out what he meant by it. Orson is a master at setting the scene, how the camera works, the setting etc. But I won't tell you more about this because this movie is an experience in itself. I rate this movie 9/10",9,5,8,18 August 2004
Spider-Man 2," Better than the prequel, by far.
","Another sequel, this time to a movie that I didn't like to begin with, so I pretty much thought that Spiderman 2 would suck. But, amazingly enough, I think this movie is much better than the first Spiderman movie. Why you might be asking? Well, let me tell you why. In this movie, you get to see more of the poor character that is Peter Parker; you realize that he is pretty much the most unlucky guy in the world, which makes him kind of an anti hero. And there is more drama this time around which I think makes it a much more interesting movie. Plus it makes the characters more realistic. Finally the villain in this movie is much cooler than the 'Toys 'R' Us' mask of the Green Goblin. Funniest scene after my opinion is when Peter Parker falls and hits everything in his way. If you liked the first Spiderman, chances are you will actually like this better. And if you didn't like the first one like me, you can still enjoy this one. I rate this movie 7/10",7,0,1,25 March 2005
Finding Nemo," Amazing how fantastic computer graphics can be
","This is a great movie, and i don't see how anyone can say differently. Pixar has once again made magic using cg. I swear sometimes it is hard to see the difference between computer animations and real film. I find that especially the ocean is masterfully done. If you haven't already seen this movie, go see it now!",10,1,2,24 January 2004
The Natural," Take me out to the ballpark. This is a great movie
","You know you are in for a great movie when you have Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Kim Basinger in the same movie. This is one of those heroic type movies where the main character is somewhat of an outsider in the beginning. People tell him he is not gonna make it because he is old and slow. Rather then talking back, he just goes out and does his work, and does it well. In this movie they use the classical slow motion to capture the last hit of the game etc and it is masterfully done. You pretty much know how this movie is going to end, but that doesn't matter cause it is so beautifully choreographed that you will enjoy it no matter what. I rate this movie 7/10",7,2,6,30 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Another catastrophic movie, and it really is!
","I was expecting of some amazing effects and i was not disappointed by that. But that was all that impressed me. Other then the effects this is not a good movie, it is a crappy movie. The main story is okay, but the character story is horrible. He risk his life trying to find his son... okay, and what is his plan when he finds him? Does he even have one? The whole movie is filled with plot holes but a lot of movies have those. But seeing that this is one boring movie i found out that trying to find plot holes was much more exciting. After the first tornadoes and the wave hits the screen i was bored. Explain to me how some people south of New York can freeze to death while resting for a bit while the main character can climb on a steel railing without gloves and is only slightly chilly? And how did the wolves come aboard? I know it is a summer movie and not an Oscar candidate but i still hate it. If they had taken away the wolves i would have given this movie a 4. But the wolves are there so i rate this crappy movie 3/10",3,1,3,16 June 2004
Blade II," Blade is back, and that is a good thing.
","First of, I am one of those people that really like the first Blade movie. So I had high hopes for the sequel. Funny, because I am not a big fan of sequels, because they tend to lack much of what the original had. Anyways, Wesley Snipes is back, and so is Kris Kristoffersen. Much is the same, the humor is the same, Blade is still the coolest cat in the world and he still has the most amazing weaponry handy. So what is the biggest difference between Blade and Blade II? Well, the action. In the first movie, they had cool music and martial arts. In this movie, they have both those things, plus computer animated moves to make it look like Blade can jump immensely high and is very quick. For me, that didn't quite work because it is so obvious that it is computer animated. But a movie like this isn't without flaws, and if you count them all, it is still an entertaining movie. So if you liked Blade, chances are, you are going to enjoy this as well. I rate this movie 6/10",6,0,2,8 February 2005
Lost in Translation," Great movie!
","It is simple yet complicated. Bill Murray as Bob Harris is in Tokyo shooting a commercial for a whiskey when he meets Scarlett Johansson as the young girl Charlotte. They are both uncomfortable in the city and they feel really alone when they are not talking to each other. They develop a very good friendship spite the fact that they are both married. This is a beautiful story on how to very different person can find together and realize that they are in fact quite similar. Watching Bill Murray do a serious role was a very positive experience based on the movies he has done earlier and Scarlett does a great role as the young and kind Charlotte. Some people say this movie is boring and moves slow, but i totally disagree. I really liked it. I give this movie an 8.",8,0,1,25 February 2004
Pitch Black," Stop making movies like this one.
","Ok, so Vin Diesel was ok in `Saving Private Ryan', but that is about it. Everything else he has been in has sucked big time. So I didn't have high hopes for this movie and I am glad I didn't. This movie is bad; in fact it is very bad. The story is lame, there aren't any actors in this movie, only people and it is very predictable. Vin Diesel is of course pretty silent during the entire movie. He is also a bad ass of course. Seems to me that this is the only role Vin Diesel can play. Bad ass silent type hero. I don't really know what else to say about this movie. I guess there are people out there who love this movie but I really can't understand why. This isn't a good movie, this is a bad movie. Now all say it with me now. THIS MOVIE SUCKS! I rate this movie 3/10",3,0,1,22 August 2004
"I, Robot"," For once, Will Smith is good.
","Not being the biggest Will Smith fan out there, I didn't expect much of this movie. Actually I expect it to be ruined by, yes you guessed it, Will Smith. So you can see that I was amazed when Will Smith didn't ruin this movie. In fact, this movie is quite enjoyable, amazingly enough. The story itself is pretty well told, and pretty original. So Will Smith has a couple of crappy lines but he is allowed to because that is his character. This movie is both action packed and pretty funny at times. The one thing that did annoy me is the advertisement in this movie; Audi, JVC, FedEx and Converse. The last one is by far the worse. Seems like they made the plot around the advertisements. Wow, cool shoes Will Smith. Thank you, they are CONVERSE. Use this conversation about 3 times and you have the movie. Like I said, I did enjoy the movie, except of course from the advertisements and the planes flying in formation at the end. I rate this movie 6/10",6,0,0,24 August 2004
American Beauty," A beautiful movie
",No wonder this movie is on the top list over best movies here on imdb.com Kevin Spacy gives an excellent performance as the family father and husband who is in need of a change. This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is both funny and sad at the same time. A must see for true movie fans.,10,0,1,11 January 2004
Van Helsing," A big disappointment, except the effects
","This movie was so hyped up and the trailers was pretty good so i looked forward to a really cool movie with action, great effects and cool one liners from Hugh Jackman. Well there was action, and the effects was pretty cool but that was about that. The story itself is kind off weird and poorly done and the dialog couldn't carry the mail. I had to high expectations for this movie and that is what ruined it for me. I like Hugh Jackman and his role as Wolverine in the X-men movies is the only reason to watch them in my opinion. The worst scene in the movie is when Anne is hanging in the rope and has just received the antidote from Carl. I mean, look at the expression on her face... It is either hilarious or just stupid. I rate this movie 5/10",5,1,1,19 May 2004
Spider-Man," Well this movie bites.
","I do admit that i didn't have high expectations when i saw this movie. I have seen a lot of superhero movies and they are never any good. I think Tobey is actually good for the role as Peter Parker. At least when i read that Leonardo DiCaprio at some point was suppose to play that part. The only thing that is good about these sort of movies is when the character get the super powers and you see the change for the first time. After that, it is really downhill. It is a shame to see a class actor like Willem Dafoe playing in this movie, at least when he is wearing a mask that seems to come from Toys 'R' Us. And the fact that Kirsten Dunst plays in this movie is for me enough reason to dislike it. And the ending with the bridge is just well... bad. Really bad. One good thing about this movie is the cameo of Bruce Campbell. Oh and the end credits so there is two things that are good about this movie. I rate this movie 4/10",4,0,1,21 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Pretty good thriller
","Hmmm, Ashton Kurcher in a serious role? This is what I was thinking when I heard about this movie. Having seen Ashton in `That 70's Show' and `Dude, where's my car?' I didn't really see him as the kind of actor that could carry this kind of movie. So I must admit I was pleasantly surprised after the movie was over. Ashton is in fact, really good in this movie. After seeing him in `Dude, where's my car' I didn't have high hopes for him to say the least. This is a thriller type of movie and deals with subjects like love, hate, destiny and sacrifice. Like always in my reviews, I won't give away anything that happens in the movie. Because I know that kind of ruins it for me. And if you read this review you probably have an idea of what the movie is about anyway. So, if you are in the mood for a mystic thriller, why not watch Butterfly Effect? I rate this movie 7/10",7,0,2,21 August 2004
28 Days Later...," Not that great...
","Well, this is the second time i comment on this movie. The first time the window suddenly closed itself so here i am again. There is one great thing about this movie and that is the shots of Jim or the car all alone on the road or in the big city. They closed down the highway for a couple of minutes at the time to make this shots and it looks great. And when Jim is walking out of the hospital you really get a feeling what it must be like to be all alone. Other than that the movie is not that great. Jim, the main character, towards the end of the movie turns out to be a cold blooded killer, killing people without anger at all. What is that about? It seems a little stupid. I will not advice against this movie, nor will i recommend it. If you want to see it, see it... I rate this movie 4/10",4,2,3,22 May 2004
City of God," Scaring and amazingly good
","This was a delight to be watching. When i say delight i don't mean i like seeing people get killed over nothing but it was so masterfully done. I have heard only good things about this movie so i was prepared for a excellent movie, and let me tell you i was not disappointed at all. The movie shows how little a human life is worth in some people eyes. The scariest part is to see the young kids, probably not more than 7-10 years old, carrying guns, thinking it is cool to kill others. The thing i remember best is when one of the young kids says: I smoke and snort. I have robbed and killed. I am a man! What kind of life do you live when you can say that sentence and believe it? Anyways, this is a very good movie and i give it the best rating i can. 10",10,3,6,7 March 2004
The Incredibles," Pixar has done it again.
","Pixar has done it again. I was wondering when they would make a bad computer animated movie, but it hasn't happened yet. This movie is just amazing. It is both funny and sweet. I think all families will recognize the problems that this animated family are having. You have a family that all have super powers, you have a villain and a secret island somewhere in the world. How can you go wrong with this? Clearly you can't cause this movie, because although it is 115 minutes long, it is still entertaining and I didn't feel like I was watching a two hour movie. There are comic references to both the young audience and for the adult audience and it is mixed beautifully. As far as I know, this is the first time that there has been an animated movie about a family that are human. So that is pretty interesting. The other thing that really caught my attention was how they did the hair for the young daughter. It looked really lifelike. So will you enjoy this movie? Well if you like the other movies in this genre; Toy Story, Ice Age, Shrek and Finding Nemo, yes you will absolutely love this one. I rate this movie 9/10",9,0,0,22 May 2005
Donnie Brasco," A very good mafia movie
","What do you get when you put three of my favourite actors in one movie? Well you get a fantastic movie called Donnie Brasco. The three favourite actors I mention is: Johnny Depp, Al Pacino and Michael Madsen. This is the story of an undercover cop infiltrating the mafia in order to get evidence on criminal activities. Johnny Depp plays this role and as usual he is amazing. The role of the mafia guy, who takes Johnny in, is played by veteran actor Al Pacino. It is no surprise that he is also fantastic. Last but not least, you have Michael Madsen and I don't know why but I have always loved his work. If you like good thrillers, you have to see this movie, it is great from beginning till end. I rate this movie 8/10",8,0,0,5 August 2004
Caddyshack," I loved it when i was younger, now i like it.
","I remember i loved this movie when i was about 10-15 years old, but watching it again when i am 24 is a little different experience. Some of the slapstick humor has lost kick. I remember laughing through my nose when i was younger and no i didn't laugh or i just chuckled. The funniest thing in the whole movie is the little shorts they are wearing. One thing i don't miss about the late seventies and eighties. I think that if it wasn't for Bill Murray (which i love) the movie would get a 4. And if it wasn't for Chevy Chase, i would rate this movie 3. But since they both are in it and they do a great job, this movie gets an 5. Remember, if you are younger you will probably love it, but some of the gags are a little childish for me at this point.",5,0,4,22 March 2004
8 Mile," A very good movie about a fantastic artist
","I have seen a few of these 'musician trying out as actor/actress' movies and this is by far the best one. Eminem, or Marshall Matters or Bunny Rabbit is not a fantastic actor, but he does good in this movie about his late teenage years. My favorite part of the movie is when he is battling the guys from the gang 'Tha Free World' and manage to say to the gang 'how can six d*cks be p*ssies?' I laughed hard at that one :) I really don't know if this is a correct display on how he grew up but all in all this is a good movie. Kim Bassinger does a great job as Eminem's disturbed mom. If you like hip hop and battling you will enjoy this movie. I rate this movie 7",7,0,0,3 April 2004
Big Fish," Great movie. WATCH IT :D
","This is truly a big movie about a small person with fantastic stories. The main character, tells his life story to everybody that wants to hear about them. And these are not your typical story that you father or uncle tells you. This is an amazing adventure with all the trimmings. When he tells the stories you get to see it as he meant/believed it happen. Throughout the movie you see one amazing thing after another and you are basically blown away with the story being told. This is just a very enjoyable movie from beginning to end. Lots of extreme characters, funny incidents and fantastic locations make this movie absolutely delightful to watch. It is both a fun movie, but it is also very sad at times.  So if you are up for a great adventure why not see Big Fish. This is one great movie from beginning till end. . I rate this movie 8/10",8,1,1,14 August 2004
Major League," Fun and good but not excellent
","Reading my headline it may seem as though I have something against this movie. I like Major League but it is not as funny as when I saw it when I was younger. Still after all these years it is still charming and I did enjoy it. It has the classic one talent thing going on where there is one who runs fast, one who batter well etc. It has a great cast list from Charlie Sheen to Wesley Snipes to Tom Berenger. The story is nothing special. They put together a team of losers who of course manage to win the entire thing. And of course there is a bad guy in these types of movies. A lot of great characters mixed with fun situations and an ok story. What do you get? You get Major League. I rate this movie 6/10",6,3,9,5 July 2004
The Last Samurai," The last Samurai is a really good movie
","I never once checked my watch during this movie, and that says a lot. I was a bit nervous before the movie, but i was convinced within minutes. Tom Cruise as the drunken army man who signs a deal to help the Japanese fight the samurai army led by Katsumoto. The movie is beautifully made and the action is very good. I gave this movie an 8.",8,1,2,17 February 2004
Total Recall," One of the best Arnold movies...
","If you don't count Terminator and Terminator 2 that is. Arnold stars in this sci-fi action which acts out on both earth and mars. If you haven't watched it before the plot can be a little hard to understand, but that is part of the movie so i wont give anything away :)",6,0,3,21 January 2004
Shine," A really well done movie. (spoiler)
","No wonder Geoffrey Rush got an Academy Award for his role as the genius yet simple David Helfgott. As a young boy he has an amazing talent playing the piano but because of his father, he grows up to be a nervous and unsure young gentleman. He defies his father and attend a music college in London. Although he has troubles dealing with everyday live it seems like he finds an inner peace once he sits at the piano. Two of the things that impressed me in this movie was: The rate at which Geoffrey talked and watching how fast the hands were moving on the piano. I have certainly gotten a new respect for piano players cause it really is amazing. I rate this movie 8",8,1,1,28 March 2004
Mystic River," Dark, sad and extremely well played. (possible spoiler)
","I am for some reason always a little thoughtful when former actors make movies. But let me tell you, this movie is excellent. Clint Eastwood has managed to make a dark, sad and extremely well played movie, using some of the best actors out there. The movie is a tragic tale of 3 childhood friends who is being put to the test in adult life when the daughter of one of them is brutally killed. After years of not talking to each other, they have to find out who's responsible. If you are looking for a movie with a happy ending you should really look another way. I really liked this movie because it is somewhat different from other movies in that genre. It shows how horrible life can be and how hard friendship can be under the wrong circumstances. I rate this movie 8/10",8,0,0,14 August 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best movies ever (spoiler)
","No wonder this movie is on second place in the top 100 movies here on imdb.com This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time and i still haven't met anyone who doesn't love it as much as i do. And if i do i will probably look at them funny and ask what is wrong with them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both excellent in this 'innocent man wants his freedom' movie. This film is about friendship, freedom and justice. A man is sent to Shawshank prison for something he didn't commit. Here he meets a man who will become his best friend. They stick up for each other against the corrupt prison system and other inmates. You really have to see it to understand how fantastic this movie is. I rate this movie 10",10,0,1,3 April 2004
Raging Bull," Great movie!
","I should have watched this movie long time ago but finally i got round to it. It is a very very good movie and i totally understand why it is on the top 250 movies of all time. Robert De Niro proves that he is one of the best in the class and it was a delight seeing him as boxer Jake La Motta. But, with that out of the way i must say i didn't like the character at all. Cocky (like all boxers) abusive and with a very short fuse. Beating his wife cause she said hello to another man. Almost killing his brother because he thinks that he has slept with his wife. I really feel sorry for the main character in this movie. Because he basically is an ass. I just hope Jake La Motta wasn't this bad in real life. But all in all this is a very powerful and moving movie and Robert De Niro deserves all credit he can get. I give this movie an 8.",8,1,2,4 March 2004
Shrek," Excellent entertainment
","This is one of those movies that everybody loves. It doesn't matter if you are a child or an old man, you are gonna enjoy this movie. It is a sweet funny story but also has some more adult jokes in between. Eddie Murphy has done some bad choices when it comes to movies lately but here he does a fantastic job as the voice for the irritating donkey. Mike Myers is as always brilliant as the green ogre, Shrek and Cameron Diaz is the voice of princess Fiona. I really like this movie because it is childish and at the same time somewhat educational. Funniest moment i think is on the DVD menu when you press 'play' and the German pigs say 'play the movie, jah, play' I rate this movie without a doubt 10",10,3,4,8 April 2004
The Emperor's New Groove," I absolutely love this movie!
","How great is this? A movie about a talking lama. I absolutely love this movie, from beginning to end. I don't know how many times I have watched this movie, but I am guessing in the over 10 area. This is the only movie that I find funnier dubbed in Norwegian than in the original language. It is absolutely hilarious, I don't care what age you are. Although I think adults understands more of the jokes in the movie, but that doesn't mean that kids won't find it funny. The movie is a story of betrayal, friendship, love and lots and lots of humour. It doesn't seem like I can ever get tired of this movie. Why? Because it is absolutely fantastic! I am 24 years old, so there aren't any age boundaries here. I rate this movie 10/10",10,59,68,24 August 2004
Bruce Almighty," A little of funny, a lot of boooooooooring
","Jim Carrey? Wow this movie must be excellent. rrrrrrrrrrr, wrong answer. The movie is funny for about 15 minutes and before and after those 15 minutes it is boring beyond belief. The whole movie reaches an all time low when Jennifer Aniston is sitting/lying on the bed praying.",4,0,1,21 January 2004
Signs," If you don't like this movie, you are wrong :)
","Some of my friends really hate this movie. Some of my friends are dumb. Me, I like this movie, not matter what people say. This is a kind of scary thriller drama made by the same guy that made The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I don't know how to spell his name so I will just call him the guyÂ… I will try to not give away anything from the movie so let me just say this; Mel Gibson plays a farmer and he lives on that farm with his family. One day there is some strange formations in his crop field, and this is where the story begins. Mr M. Night `something or another' has made a powerful and entertaining movie in `Signs'. The characters are well played and likable. Maybe there is too much drama for some people, but I really think that builds and holds the movie the entire time. So in my opinion, if you like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable you will enjoy this movie. I rate this movie 7/10",7,0,2,14 August 2004
Identity," This is on creepy movie... And i love it!
","I haven't heard anything about this movie when i started watching it one late night. I never read on the back of the cover so i didn't know what it was about or anything. The fact that John Cusack and Ray Liotta stared in this movie made it good enough for me to watch. And let me tell you, watching this movie all alone in the middle of the night made it even creepier. Suddenly the house started making noises and it all added to the experience of this movie. The movie itself is great! Dark, creepy and at times a little weird. I for one had no idea what was going on and the end was awesome. I do not want to give away anything so i will be careful with what i say. But i will say this. Watch this movie. You will not regret it. And if you don't like it there is something wrong with you :) I rate this movie 8/10",8,0,1,30 May 2004
Amélie," Say what you want, but this is a wonderful movie,...
","and so far I haven't met anyone who doesn't absolutely love this movie. After the first 5 minutes I knew this movie was going to be something special and I was right. It is a love story but not like anything you have seen before. When I saw it, it made me thing a little about Lost in Translation. Because the girl and the guy in this movie are somewhat of loners and strangers to the city they live in. And they only function 100 percent when they are with each other. During the movie they play sort of a cat and mouse game, mainly because the girl is too scared to make direct contact with the guy. This movie is awesome, cute, funny and memorable. Now wonder it is on the top 250 list. I rate this movie 9/10",9,0,2,28 July 2004
The Replacements," This is one fun movie! (spoiler)
","I don't care what anybody says, i love this movie. It is a simple yet very funny and sweet movie. Keanu Reeves does a great job as the average joe turned hero. The pros are money hungry people who have lost the love for the game. So they strike and that is what this movie is about. They put in replacements to play instead of the pros with hilarious results. Somewhat it is similar to the traditional fairytales. The players have one thing they do great. One is very fast, one is fat, one is crazy and so on...Favorite moment: When one of the players take out his gun and shoots the porsche. The actor i liked most in this movie is Rhys Ivans as the smoker who can kick like crazy. I rate this movie 9/10",9,1,3,18 April 2004
