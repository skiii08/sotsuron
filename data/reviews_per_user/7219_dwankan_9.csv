The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Manufactured Tension
","I liked some moments in this movie, but too many of them consisted of forced conflict. It's hard to believe the main character is stupid enough to reject the cause of the rebellion, but she does, repeatedly, because there seems to be a desire to re-create the same formula as the previous in this part of the series. I guess the idea is that she's independent and thinks everyone is trying to use her, but she becomes utterly impossible to sympathize with in this film because she leverages everyone's life for Peeta's. Unfortunately, it doesn't work, and it isn't believable. I have to say, though, all the comparisons to the Japanese film Battle Royale are absurd, as the Japanese film is nothing like Hunger Games, and it also took its story from another, and so on. Rejecting a novel or a film because it has some plot similarity to another film or novel or short story will eliminate all stories ever made. If we want to be precise, we can go back to the original short story by Ralph Ellison and discount all variations, but that's wasted time, and it has nothing to do with the merits of this film. I'm on board with the complaints that this was artificially cut into two parts. Film makers are trying to trick us with this nonsense, and I refuse to pay any time and money to Peter Jackson's absurd over-extension of the one-book classic, when he spent three (admittedly overly long) films on a six book series. This should have been one film, and since it wasn't that great as the half of the film it should have been, I'm going to be reluctant to pay for the next part. In fact, I might just buy and read the book instead.",6,0,4,1 May 2015
Constantine," Fun for what it is
","This movie does a pretty good job of combining action and effects. I enjoyed it. I can't compare it to the comic because, although I've read several of the Hellblazer comics, the series felt aimless, and I stopped pretty soon after starting them. What this film does well is to tell a bizarre story of a battle between demons and humans (with some angels to even things out) with some, albeit predictable, excitement. Unfortunately, it isn't consistent. Some moments in the film went so far beyond credibility that even the actors couldn't pretend to believe it anymore. A further problem, but a common one for the comic-book-turned-into-film genre (so we can't blame this movie for it) is some of the corniest lines ever. At one point, a demon talks about how much he wants one of the characters to die, and he uses the phrase 'finger-lickin' good.' Yes, the writers actually put that one in. The acting is sometimes good and sometimes not so good. Keanu Reeves does a mediocre job as usual and Shia Lebeouf plays the same annoying character he played in I, Robot. Rachel Weisz by far outshined all the others in the production, even though she stumbled over some of the more unrealistic exchanges. All in all, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it as a decent time killer at most.",7,1,2,17 April 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Great movie for teenagers
","I've been watching the MCU films, and I've enjoyed most of them greatly despite their (expected) flaws. Unfortunately, this one doesn't work for me, I think mostly because I'm over the age of 17.
This film is mostly a standard, formulaic high school dramedy. In one sequence, the sidekick friend announces to their entire PE class that Peter knows Spiderman. This leads to a high school party scene (like every high school party scene in every high school movie you've ever seen) and Peter struggling with whether or not he should become Spiderman to impress the girl he likes. The sidekick friend is chubby but funny, the girl is pretty and clearly into Peter, but he's too shy to go after her, the adults just don't take Peter seriously, and in the film he was mostly struggling to find his self esteem.
I came into this for a super hero movie, not a Disney Channel series following the ins and outs of a quirky teenager's life problems, and this plays like a lesson-learning episode of a standard acculturation serial, the Marvel super-hero aspect playing second fiddle throughout to the believe-in-yourself-young-middle-class-person plot.
The movie does have a few good points: I like Michael Keaton in it, Tom Holland makes a good Peter Parker even if he gets a little annoying sometimes, and it adds some (albeit shallow) depth to the MCU.",5,0,1,4 January 2019
Oblivion," Uninteresting
","With all the rave reviews, I was expecting a good film. This barely makes mediocre. Yes, it looks good, but so what? The acting is as clumsy and unbelievable as the dialog. It does have an exciting, albeit generic, sci-fi scenario, so it may offer some mild entertainment. If you care more about production than story and acting, you'll probably love this.",4,1,4,25 June 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Weak Entry in the MCU Series
","The Marvel films are not high art, nor are they great entertainment, but they're fun for what they are: cheesy, brainless action fests with some shallow character development to make them feel like they have at least some microscopic depth. I love them, but I'm not under any delusion that they're something wonderful.
This film is even further from wonderful than the series has offered so far. The plot is piled high with so many concurrent stories, they all come out as underdeveloped. If you want just a hodge podge of fights and shooting, you'll love this, but there isn't much else going on, at all, and even that aspect of it is disappointing. At a certain point in the film, random Marvel characters just start showing up out of nowhere, as if they'd given up on creating a reason for them to be there.
The worst part of the movie is the ridiculous monster Thanos. He's unoriginal, uninteresting, and the animation of his absurd face, body, and clothing are so obviously fake, I felt like I was watching a cartoon whenever he was on screen. I didn't like him when I first saw him in Guardians: I thought he was a silly, cartoonish monster bad guy, and I was greatly disappointed that he headlined this film. Unfortunately, the goofy, kid-bate aspects of movies like Guardians and Ant Man have taken over the entire franchise because otherwise, they would have written a more interesting antagonist for this one. And what's with the beard, or the wrinkles that look like a beard; just another example of how silly Thanos is as a character.
Be warned if you haven't seen this one: it's got a 'sad' and rather abrupt ending. I admire them for trying to break the standard a bit, but it felt forced and unfinished because, I'd guess, the writers aren't used to having such an ending for such a film. It doesn't work, by the way.",5,1,1,7 January 2019
A Quiet Place," Bad Movie with Good Acting and Production
","Let's start with what's good about A Quiet Place.
The production is beautiful. How the concept was executed really made a difference in keeping me watching such a piece of trash.
All of the actors did a wonderful job. Even though their emotions were shallow and unbelievable, their characters had no depth at all, and their relationships were vapid and without nuance, they made me believe it.
So what was wrong with it?
The story was absurd from every angle. Creatures who kill anything that makes a noise would soon run out of prey, but here they are four years down the road still killing away. Where did they come from? Who knows? Be scared for the family and shut up.
Why would people continue to breed when babies are impossible to keep quiet? How is it that somebody is sinking into a silo of corn one minute, almost dying, and then hiding under a metal door, in the corn, without sinking, the next? The answer is the answer to every problem in this movie: it was convenient to the plot for reality to be inconsistent.
About twenty minutes from the end, one of the characters discovers a solution to the problem. Yay, they're saved! No, because they had twenty more minutes of screen time to fill up, so we just won't bother to apply the glaringly obvious solution until after some more horrible things happen and it's about time for the standard feature length ending.
Why in the name of all that's holy would somebody nail an extra large nail through the bottom of a stair nowhere near any other pieces of wood? Not where it attaches to anything, no just right in the middle of the stair, through the bottom and sticking right up out the top so that somebody can catch it on a sack of potatoes and then later forget that it's sticking up right in the middle of the board and step right on it.
I don't mind a little silliness on the part of a character. Sometimes it builds tension when they make bad choices with some questionable but understandable motives. But in this movie, it isn't about those types of choices: it's all about a series of unbelievable details that serve no purpose but to create crises. By the end of it, the good acting and production had been eaten by the horrible, horrible writing.",3,1,3,26 February 2020
Elysium," Old Story, New Plot Holes
","The only creative aspect of this film is its plot holes. I can ignore some implausibility with science fiction, but this one went too far. It didn't help that I've seen far too many futuristic elitist dystopias in the past several years and that even the best actors in this film seemed to be struggling through to their paychecks. Like Hunger Games and Upside Down, it featured a future society in which the poor are sacrificed or exploited to benefit a small group of elites, but the satellite where all the privileged live, on not too close inspection, doesn't seem even large enough to contain much more than the control centers and political offices that show in the film. It also features a scrappy hero who's been in trouble but now just wants to get by, but it's hard to sympathize with his purely self-centered reasons for fighting the system; he only wants to cure himself of radiation poisoning. He does sacrifice himself at the end, so there is a type of redemption, but it really doesn't make sense that the solution to looming oppression is to program the computers to stop being bigots, at which point, the elite all have to be nice because they only do what the computers tell them to do. I guess the writer(s) didn't study what happened to African Americans in the US after the emancipation proclamation: it was not all peaches and cream just because the white establishment called them citizens. Some of the film looked great, but I was too busy, rolling my eyes at every single movement of the plot, to notice it. District 9 was an interesting and innovative film. Elysium is, in every way that matters, exactly the opposite.",1,16,28,28 January 2014
The Witch," Validation for the Salem Witch Trials
","This movie is an absolute mess. It can't make up its mind whether it wants to vilify aimless accusations of witchcraft or to say that superstition is a good way to spend emotional energy and family dynamics. There are some creepy sexual implications involving barely adolescent teens, the characters are one minute good, the next minute evil, and ultimately, none of them are likable. I guess Eggers wanted to take a different approach, but he seems to change his approach with every scene. As a general rule, the more often twists occur, the less likely the audience is going to stay with you, and this film lost me within an hour.",2,3,8,14 January 2017
Life," Good production of an unoriginal script
","This movie, well made and well acted (mostly), was doomed to mediocrity because the script had almost nothing in the way of originality. It's a monster alien movie, which I've seen over and over and over and over again. They've found life on Mars, the biologist falls in love with it (as always), and his obsession (tied to some personal issues that were only marginally explored, as always) leads to the creature getting out and trying to eat everyone (as always). The rest you can probably guess for yourself, as it follows the standard formula of monster alien movies. The one bit of praise I can offer is that at least they didn't include any meathead macho soldier characters. Still, the story was cliche, the characters were not developed at all, the twists and turns were predictable, and the ending was a cheap, poorly explained set up for a sequel, which I doubt will happen.",5,0,0,17 May 2020
