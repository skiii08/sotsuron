Requiem for a Dream," Wonderfully disturbing!
",'Requiem' far surpasses 'Traffic' in both artistic intention and cinematic execution. It is a wonderful example of a director who is blessed with a clear vision and has the freedom to realize it.All facets of the craft of filmmaking are seamlessly blended to tell this disturbing tale of human descent. The performances are all of the highest calibre from the principle leads to minor players.It is as much art as it is entertainment. A rare combination indeed.Well done Darren and Matty! An inspiration to all who are still fighting the good fight!,9,0,0,19 February 2001
