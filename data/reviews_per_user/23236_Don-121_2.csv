Antz," An enjoyable film, but suffers in Disney's shadow
","Antz, on it's own, would have been a good movie, if you enjoy Woody Allen's neurotic characters and self-depreciating one-liners.  When held up to the same standard as 'A Bug's Life', however, it's looks like a cheap immitation.  I don't know how these movies spontaneously pop up -- like one year we get a pair of asteroid movies, the next, a pair of animated ant movies -- but 'Antz' is worth seeing once.  'A Bugs Life' is worth owning, you'll want to watch it again and again, uh, I mean your kids will want to watch it again and again.",7,1,1,15 May 1999
L.A. Confidential," This film is flash with no substance
","This movie is total flash with absolutely no substance.  Potato Chips for couch potatos.  The stylization is flat.  It would seem from the other reviewers that if you find a bunch of 1930's outfits and cars that your movie is now 'stylized'.  And what's with Kim Basinger?  The big shoker is that we see a photo of the detective kissing a prostitute on the floor with all her clothes on?  Oh my god!  I can overlook a few plot and motivation flaws (there were many in this move), but what's the big payoff here?  An ending riddled in cliches.  This movie has all the empty calories of a can of Pringles.  I'm mystified at positive response people gave this one.",1,31,98,13 September 1999
