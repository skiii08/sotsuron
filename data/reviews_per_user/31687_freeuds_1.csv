Hereditary," Very very dissapointing....
",For a film which has 7.7 on IMDB this was truly bad. It could have been so much and just ended being a cheap supernatural with a rediculous ending. Only saving grace was Toni Collette otherwise it would have been in the dumpster! Not worth spending your money at the cinema.....,2,1,4,22 June 2018
