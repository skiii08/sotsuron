Miracle," This years Academy award winning best actor...
","Its incredible to note that the one truly negative review so far of this movie is by one who described it as a movie about the 'U.S. Olympic soccer team.'  No, not a typo, the reviewer actually used the word soccer 3 times! And even more pathetic was how the reviewer concluded by saying the movie would have been better had it been about something else!  Its pretty pathetic to not like a movie when you obviously have not seen it, its even worse to actually do a review about it.Oh well, on to my review...The movie MIRACLE will be enjoyed by millions, even if they know nothing about hockey, which is very fitting as millions enjoyed the 1980 gold medal performance of the USA Hockey Team, many of them non-hockey fans as well. It brilliantly captures the moment of the miracle, after beautifully detailing the events that led up to the decisive win over the Russians.I went to the UW at the same time that Mark Johnson did, which makes the movie (as well as the actual miracle) even more compelling to me.  The only people I could imagine not liking this movie are those that either hate sports, or those that watch the movie and come away thinking it was about a soccer match (hehe):)The only thing worse than Chicago winning an Oscar would be if Kurt Russell didn't win an Oscar for best actor!  He truly dominates the movie, which was a heartwarming tribute to Herb Brooks who died virtually during the filming of this movie.  The supporting cast did their roles perfectly, as did the makers of this film, who delivered one of the most accurate portrayals of one of the most exciting sporting events of the 20th century.Go see this movie...if you leave not liking it, then check your pulse to see if you are still alive.  Or if you come away thinking it was a movie about soccer, then lightning truly can strike twice in the same place!",6,1,1,8 February 2004
Heartbreak Ridge," If you believe this I have some swamp land in Florida for sale.
","I went to USMC boot camp in 1977, rose to the rank of Private First Class. In 1978 I went to Junior OCS, and again in 1980 Senior OCS, when I was commissioned as a 2nd Lt. Finally, in 1985 I attained the rank of Captain. I completed my service in 1990.With that said, I can assure you that there was nothing right, accurate, or plausible in this movie.However, I am a sucker for Clint Eastwood, and he was fascinating to watch in this movie. Watch it, but please do not assume this has any resemblance to the Marine Corps.I recommend it as a generic military movie. Without Clint, I would have given it 2 of 10, with him it gets a hearty 5 of 10.",5,7,10,2 October 2006
Jarhead," Finally a movie for non-Marines!
","The only thing this movie had to do with Marines was the two 'uh-rahs' in the movie (not counting the group uh-rah). And they were not expressed appropriately. You just don't say uh-rah like you are asking to pass the salt.I went to USMC boot camp and OCS in the 70's, so I can attest to some of this movie's authenticity, but I have to suggest that the majority of the movie is just trash.It is trash born from the mind of a disgruntled ex-marine who's only objective is to make money by writing a book. He succeeded at the detriment of the USMC.I cannot recommend this movie.",4,1,2,7 April 2006
Collateral," Cheesy, but recommended
","In 'Dumb and Dumber' the taxi driver drops a beautiful woman off at the airport, and so does this movie start. 'Stripes' starts in a similar way, but they never make it to the airport.But this is not a comedy.Everything in-between is fun adventure, but the plot is weakened by unlikely events leading to less likely events, finally to the beautiful woman from the beginning again.Cruise and Foxx are great in this movie, especially Foxx. Maybe its just me, but the awkwardness of the plot keeps me from rating this movie high. I give it a 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,2 January 2005
Independence Day," Almost great...
","The story is there, the special effects are there; we are only short of actors.Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch combine to wreck this movie, while everyone else does a good job. Their constant bickering, and posturing, is annoying and undershadows better performances.Pullman, Smith, Loggia, and especially Randy Quaid are the ones to watch, and almost save the movie. I am disappointed however, because this could have been one of the best of all time.Goldblum and Hirsch, in my opinion, relegate this movie to B status. I still rate it 7/10 for effort, pathos, and fun!",7,1,2,26 July 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Overrated and uneven
","Plenty of war drama and blockbuster action to start the movie, then a long boring few hours to end it. Very unrealistic overall. Hardly a great war movie. If we are to view the title of the movie as the plot of the movie, then we have been fooled greatly.If it is really saving Private Ryan, then why no scenes of Private Ryan until the movie is almost over? Well, if there had been, then they couldn't have played that little prank on the viewers of the first Private Ryan saved being the wrong one (Matt Damon).If you are going to watch this movie, have plenty of coffee, because after the first half you will fall asleep quick. This is just another stage for Tom Hanks, a mediocre actor that the studios keep trying to push down our throats (except for Forrest Gump, a role he was well equipped for). I give it 5 of 10 stars, because of a few good scenes.",5,4,9,16 January 2004
Meet Joe Black," You don't have to worry about taxes once you are dead.
","I really like this movie. Brad Pitt was perfectly cast. His boyish charm is a winner. And his robotic acting fits the role.Claire Forlani is perfect as the fall in love, bashful beauty. Man, check out the pool scene for a steamy romp. Claire goes all out to deliver the most vampish look, and she carries it off very well.But of course Anthony Hopkins carries the movie. The scenes with him and Brad are priceless. Hopkins is able like none other, to evoke emotions that are integral to the movie's purpose.There are some sci-fi boundaries that are crossed in this story, which are concepts you just need to accept if you want to enjoy the movie.",9,17,27,11 March 2006
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Even Disney can't screw up a good story.
","The story is great, the movie is bad. I didn't care for the casting, except for the actor who played Eddie the caddy and the actor who played Vardon.I didn't care for the directing. The story of Ouimet is so good that it would have been great without all the weird camera work. For example, several times at an exciting point in the game, Paxton used weird flashbacks and cartoon like contrivances. And what was the point of the ladybug on the ball? Sometimes it got just plain weird.I have other problems with the movie, but the playoff statistics were entirely incorrect. In the 1913 US Open playoff Ouimet shot a 72, Vardon shot a 77, and Ray shot a 78. (source: golfweb.com)The movie ending shows Ouimet winning by one stroke. I give it 5 out of 10 just because the story is so good. I just don't understand why Disney felt they had to change history to make it a good movie.",6,7,12,29 August 2006
The Last Samurai," Better than I thought it would be
","I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, other than A Few Good Men.  He was pretty good in this movie, although my choice for best actor in this movie would be Watanabe.I generally liked the plot, in which Cruise as a war hero has painful misgivings about his role in senseless battles killing innocent American Indians.  His character goes through a coming of age sub-plot, when he finally has a chance to redeem himself by choosing a path of righteousness rather than blindly following orders.I liked the first half of the movie better than the second half, which became a bit unglued (in my opinion).  For example, Cruise is escorted and given safe passage back into town.  Then both Katsumoto and his son (in separate scenes) come waltzing into town and, although not greeted warmly, are generally given the freedom to roam.  It seems that since they had both been hunted throughout the movie, that they would have been killed on sight. Just seemed odd to me given the violent encounters earlier in the film.My favorite part of the film is Algren's stay with the Samurai's.  It overshadows almost everything before and after.  The closing battle is OK, but is pretty much a remake of the battle scenes in every epic movie (i.e., Braveheart, The Patriot, Spartacus, Gettysburg, on and on...), with the only thing left for the viewer is to guess who would come out on top.The ending is fairly rewarding, showing that Katsumoto's sacrifice had meaning.  I did find it rather cheesy when in the end, the narrator said something like 'nobody ever knew what happened to Captain Algren' then they proceeded to show an ending where Algren ended up with his love interest.  I would think they need to do one or the other, not both.Given my peevish quibbles, I really liked the movie and recommend it highly. It has a thought provoking plot, great scenery, and good acting (especially the Japanese characters).",8,1,2,30 May 2004
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Can't get any more stupid
","Big robots with English accents.Did they attend Oxford? Dialogue that makes no sense.No plot, no action.lots of mugging for the camera.We are now officially the most stupid nation on the face of the planet for allowing this crap of a movie.I love comic books and some of the movies that are made from them, but not this one!Don't go to the theatre, don't rent it, don't even watch it for free!Getting your nipples pierced would be less painful than watching this movie.",1,3,11,21 September 2010
War of the Worlds," Is it possible to make a C movie in 2005?
","A little war in the beginning, then 70 minutes of Tom Cruise in basements. It is hard to believe that in the 52 years since the original was made that we could not come up with better special effects.Apparently we are not to worry about the end of the world so much as we are to worry about Tom Cruise's family. But then I did not care about them as the producer did not give me any reason to.Cheesy scenes! Like Cruise had the only van left in the world, and he was mobbed. Why didn't the mob just run like everyone else? Afterall, once they got the van it was not drivable anymore.Stupid Stupid movie! The title 'War of the Worlds' gives you the impression it will be a movie on a grand scale, and it turns out to be the cheapest, most trite movie as a vehicle for Tom Cruise; once again proving that this egotistical actor ignores the will of the people (as well as the directors that cast him in tripe like this).See 'War of the Worlds' 1953, but skip this one.",6,2,5,4 December 2005
