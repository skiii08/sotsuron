Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fastest Paced Star Wars
","One thing we're all hearing on the news right now, is how a new Star Wars film is coming out. There is a lot of hype and excitement. I was wondering if there'd be anymore Star Wars after Episode 3. I even remember talking with friends back in 1999 about Lucas planning episodes 7-9. Right now, it's only to 7. When Episode 1 came out we were anticipating sequels every 3-years. So, after a 10-year hiatus another Star Wars movie is coming out, which has brought lots of excitement especially to the Star Wars fans. More excitement than when episodes 2 and 3 came out as those were anticipated movies only 3-years apart.Seeing all this excitement reminds me of when Star Wars Episode 1 was coming out. I'm old enough to remember back then. I seriously can't believe how long ago that time was. Back then in 1999, YouTube wasn't a website and it was harder to stream videos on the internet. There also wasn't really social media, not like today. Back then as you can see on the IMDb trivia, and I even remember my friend telling me this at the time when he was only 10. There were a lot of people who would pay a full-price for a movie just to see the Star Wars movie trailer, and they wouldn't even stay for the movie. They'd just leave after the trailer for Episode 1 was shown. It was exciting back then to think after a 16-year hiatus and starting with the later episodes, they'd start from episode 1, the beginning of the story.I'll tell you now, if you watch the Star Wars films in chronological order, I'm sure you'll notice they don't seem canon. Episode 1-3 we'll see canon as their trilogy along with episodes 4-6. But, the trilogies will barely seem to go together. This new film also looks more canon to episodes 4-6 considering we see Harrison Ford in it, and it looks like the Star Wars action we're familiar with. The earlier episodes of Star Wars seem newer than episodes 4-6 with higher quality special effects and where the actors in the earlier films seem like they're from the '70s-'80s as opposed to today. Also, how there are vague references to the earlier story from the later episodes, as I believe Lucas was still coming up with it.In other words of watching the series in chronological order, it's not like Dragon Ball Z as fans of the show know that they started with DragonBall Z in the U.S. and people are probably less familiar with DragonBall. But, DragonBall was the earlier and original series and if you watch the earlier episodes of DragonBall, it will seem more canon to DragonBall Z than the earlier episodes of Star Wars will seem canon to the Star Wars series. Now that I'm talking about DragonBall Z, I'll mention that I think D.B.Z. is a better story than Star Wars.But, what makes this 1st episode great. So, yeah there was lots of excitement for episode 1 but a lot of people are giving this movie bad reviews including here on IMDb. I have to give it a positive review, here's why? It seems like a lot of the negative reviews were because of people who disliked Jar Jar Binks, or didn't like Anakin Skywalker as a kid, and how the actor who played him has long since quit acting. Some of us think there should have been a different child actor for his part. You could look at the auditions. Even during this episode, we knew who Anakin would become as it wasn't meant to be a surprise. It seems like the actor who played Qui Gon Jin didn't like playing his part either.But, what I like about this first Star Wars film is out of all of them it seems like the most innocent. I guess it's pretty innocent showing a child as a main character and a hero for the series. That being said, this movie would definitely work for younger kids, probably more than the other films as it can almost seem like the plot was written by a kid. But, not like it was poorly written. Though, some people disagree with the writing of the movie.As my title says, I also feel like this film is the fastest paced one in the series. It's been awhile since I've seen a Star Wars movie and the later ones. Star Wars is a good story with good action, but I feel like a lot of them have so many Go Pee moments. Long movies that have a lot of slow scenes, and episode 3 can be a little depressing. This first movie seems like the happiest in the series.Another fun memorable scene from this movie which would also make me consider it the best one is the Pod Racing scene. The other Star Wars movies seem to focus on the story and action. The Pod Racing scene was just a really well done fun scene making us see Anakin's young abilities. I thought I heard there was a video game called Pod Racing made a long time, but I haven't heard about it in such a long time.I also feel like this Star Wars movie would be the easiest to understand. So, while I'm not a big fan of Star Wars, I have to rank this one as the best. I know this displeases some of you who dislike this movie. But, I think it was well done and is the most fun. I give it a 9/10.",9,5,8,17 December 2015
Home Alone," A Movie That Defines The Holiday Season
","I have a friend who I once saw call the Holiday Season, the Home Alone Season. It's amazing to think how this movie was made many years ago, but is widely remembered and still regularly watched. It seems like almost all of us have seen Home Alone, and it seems like most people have seen it more than once. For one, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie outside of the Holiday Season, just how you likely wouldn't listen to Christmas music outside of the Holiday Season even though you could. I mean this movie just gives you the Christmas spirit when it's around. I watched this movie around 6 months ago, and it just didn't seem as enjoyable as it used to seem, and I just thought it's best if I wait until the Holiday Season to see it, even though you can probably find it on TV all year round, and during the Holiday Season it will be on ABC Family. It's just better to get into the Christmas Spirit when Christmas is around. Anyway, I just left a review on the 2nd Home Alone movie. I prefer the 2nd one over this as I feel like the 2nd one is more funny and we see Kevin in a more exciting place than home, as in the 2nd movie he's in NYC. In this movie, he's home alone in his quiet neighborhood where most of the other neighbors seem gone and a neighborhood that's being burglarized at the same time by Marv and Harry. However, while watching this movie I noticed there aren't many exciting scenes until the climax of the movie. Kevin is also somewhat of a brat, especially during the beginning of the movie like the way a kid who is supposed to be 8 talks to his Mom. This movie shows family time as showing a rich family inviting their extended family over and all trying to leave for Paris. So, we remember the opening scene showing a family that is in a hurry all around the house and Kevin feeling ditched by his family and being a brat about that. While this movie has it's flaws it is still somewhat enjoyable, I mean we've all seen it and I think a lot of us are tired of it because we've seen it many times and basically know what's going to happen. Also, I'm surprised this movie has done so well as a movie. One similar movie I prefer over Home Alone is Blank Check. I think Blank Check has more of a plot than Home Alone. By all means, this movie is still good and entertaining. I'll want to watch this movie again during the Holiday Season just to get myself into the Christmas Spirit. I give this movie an 8/10.",8,1,2,25 September 2014
Knowing," Benjamin Gates In Knowing
","First off, I just finished running on the treadmill while watching the movie National Treasure. National Treasure with Nicholas Cage is a fun movie to watch that I immediately remember including the characters, and it takes me back to when that movie was new in the years 2004 and 2005, which I seriously can't believe was a decade ago. Of course, I'm not here to talk about National Treasure, because this isn't the IMDb page for National Treasure, however while watching that movie I immediately thought about this movie. Let's think, what do these two movies have in common, that's right the main actor Nicholas Cage. He starred in this movie some years after National Treasure was made. While I believe Nicholas Cage is a big actor, I haven't seen him in that many films, and the movie I remember him the most from is National Treasure. Sometimes when you see an actor you recognize from a movie or TV show, while that actor plays a different character we almost feel like that character played by the actor in that movie, is the same character played by the same actor in a different movie, as if Benjamin Gates from National Treasure was John Koestler in Knowing. The characters seem to have some similarities and were possibly the right ones for the roles. For example, it seems like both characters in both movies they are very well educated men. In National Treasure, Cage's interest was more American History which made him believe in a hidden treasure. In this movie we see how his interest is more about 'Determinism.' That might not be the right word I forget what it's called, but the prediction of future events from past events and that each event happens in sequence from a prior cause leading to the next. Also, in similarity both characters come across a series of codes that only they seem to be the only ones to figure out what they mean and try to go after where the code leads to.Among the differences between John Koestler and Benjamin Gates. Benjamin Gates in National Treasure seems to be a single 40-year old man hanging out with his nerdy friend Riley, and we later see his love interest Abigail. In this movie, John Koestler is a single father a widower. He lives alone with his 9-year old son Caleb Koestler and frequently acts depressed. So, seeing John Koestler as a father of a kid and as a widower gives different meaning to his character that wasn't in either National Treasure. The kids in this movie also give a certain scary mood from the movie seeing how the horror is coming from the few main kids in the cast POV. This movie isn't quite like National Treasure in terms of action, fun, and adventure. This movie is more of a creepy scary movie and possibly even horror movie. Not really really like horror movie, but around as scary as movies like Jurassic Park which if you can handle, you should handle this. Also, how kids are the main characters in this movie when National Treasure doesn't really have kids as a main cast. National Treasure mostly has grown ups on a big adventure. Seeing how kids are among the cast gives more meaning to this movie. It also does not seem quite as cheesy as National Treasure, as National Treasure can at times be cheesy. The first two that came out seemed to have the same mood. This movie has a darker mood which if you like horror movies, you should enjoy this. The intensity of the scenes should get to you, as a lot of scenes just have a really dark tone to them. But, in all while this isn't a fun adventure movie to watch like National Treasure, it's a fun horror movie to watch that will keep you watching, wondering what will happen next. I give it a 9/10.",9,1,2,8 April 2015
The Lego Movie," Some Movies You Don't Like Are Very Popular
","I've seen this movie twice, one time I rented it from Redox and another time I watched it with my parents at home. I have to say, my nephews love this movie it is like their favorite movie. That's good for them that they liked it, but this movie didn't entertain me too much. I mean it had a good moral to the story, it had nice special effects but there were some things wrong with this movie.First off, I played with Lego's as a kid. I used to play Lego's with a couple of friends when I was a kid. I played with Legos up until I was like in 8th Grade. Rather then do the building I mostly just came up with my own stories with a friend and we would play with the Lego's with our own stories, having our own fictional worlds from our imaginations. Yeah, this is what the movie mostly looked like. It looked like an imaginative kids story. I mean there didn't seem to be much of a plot to it, I mean there is a plot but it does not seem like a memorable or good plot. The movie seems more about the special effects and Lego universe. Legos have been a popular kids toy for a very long time. They finally made a movie out of it. The movie also left us with a great message which might seem like a typical movie message for kids films, but still a great message. The characters in this movie seemed one dimensional. Now, that they finally came up with a Lego movie, it reminds me of a Lego game I played as a kid a couple of times called Lego Island. I didn't play that game that often, but it seemed to have more of a plot, and relatable world than this movie.So, I'll say that there are a couple of movies that you like, or people with your taste will like them, but they aren't very popular. An example of that, is like my favorite movie is Earth To Echo which I also left a review on, and about half the reviews for that movie are positive. Luckily, that movie didn't flop as it had a low budget but it didn't make a lot of money and I feel like it's way underrated. There are also movies you don't like that are very popular an example of that is a movie that was pretty popular especially 10 years ago with all this franchise and people quoting the movie, Napoleon Dynamite. I haven't seen that movie in a long time, and don't really care for it, or find it entertaining. But, so many other people thought of that slow pace movie as entertaining. Now, to share an example of a TV show, There was one TV show I loved which aired in 2009 called The Othersiders on Cartoon Network CN Real, but that show got cancelled after four months because of the low ratings, and you can find very little information about that show.I'm not here to talk about other movies or TV shows. But, to me The Lego Movie seems like too kiddish of a movie for me, like a film more so for the younger audience and not as much for the older audience because of the lack of plot and being a little cheesy making the Lego characters not seem realistic, but fictional and one dimensional. I'll give this movie a 4/10 because it was clever, it did have good effects and a message. It's incredible to think adults could imagine this, I mean my Dad thought it was incredible to think of people imagining this. But, if you have my taste then you're much better off watching a film like Earth To Echo. I wouldn't recommend this film, but I'd strongly recommend that film. I also will say that this movie would probably entertain most kids under 12.",4,5,11,27 January 2015
Independence Day," Action Entertaining, Characters Forgettable
","It seems like about every holiday has a movie based on the holiday. Frequently, the movies are also named after the holiday as they did it with this movie. Most of the movies named after a holiday are not action movies with exception to this one. This movie is a movie you can definitely expect to see on TV during the 4th of July, as that holiday just happened. A little like how you can definitely expect to see Home Alone and Home Alone 2 on TV during the holiday season, and if you're like me, you'll like watching them around the holidays to get into the holiday spirit. This movie would definitely be an entertaining movie to watch on Independence Day with friends. Seeing action in movies naturally excites us and keeps our eyes on the screen. The action in this movie is definitely one to excite you.So, while this movie has some entertaining action it definitely has flaws which I notice and you probably notice too. Like the biggest example I think has to be getting to know the characters. This movie has multiple main characters, and scenes keep switching from one character to the next. We might remember a couple of the actors that starred in this movie, but we will probably forget the name of the character they played. As the scenes keep switching from characters, it is hard for us to keep up with all of them and a lot of the scenes we see them in where there isn't action are slow scenes. They don't seem like characters you'd write a wiki article after or really care to know about their background outside of the movie. The characters mostly seem like just a group of people from different backgrounds handling an alien invasion. Will Smith also starred in the movie Men In Black which also dealt with aliens and came out less than a year after this one does. We seem to get to know his character better in that movie than this one, and we'd probably think of Men In Black a little more as entertaining, and his character is a little more funny in that movie.Again, the action scenes are cool. The first action sequence has to be the most memorable as it is seen in the covers of this movie. It is sometimes even shown in pop culture, like they show a scene from the first action sequence in Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me. The action sequences after that look like scenes from a Star Wars movie, or a video game. They remind me of a video game I used to play, Star Fox 64. Those scenes are cool and can be cheesy at times, but also have humor to them. They also have really good special effects that seem to work really well, almost 20 years later.The plot from this movie does not seem too out of the ordinary. It seems like a common plot of having aliens come to earth. Some aliens coming in peace, and others wrecking havoc like this one, and humanity having to find ways to defend themselves. About movies of aliens coming in peace, one movie which I feel like is way underrated and it seems like half the people who saw this movie loves it, is a movie that came out last year called Earth To Echo. I'd go far enough to consider that the greatest movie ever made, and I'd strongly recommend it. Also, another movie I'd recommend in movies named after holidays which I feel like is slow but entertaining, and the slow scenes in that movie are more entertaining than the slow scenes in this movie is called Labor Day. I enjoyed it when I saw it.One thing I always remember from watching this movie on TV and how it's on during Independence Day and I remember this from many years ago. If you watch movies on TV, they frequently shorten some scenes and go to commercials at the exact same time every year you watch it on TV. I notice that with Home Alone, how some scenes are shortened and one scene in particular from Home Alone that I remember them going to commercials to is after Kevin looks out the window after fooling the crooks of people in the house using mannequins, if you watch it on like TBS. In this movie, from what I remember watching it from like 18-years ago as a kid also on Independence Day. While I don't know this movie well enough to talk about shortened scenes, I always remember how one time this movie switches to commercials is after the first action sequence right after the light bulb in the tunnel pops. A way to keep us watching to find out what happens next.So, the movie is entertaining and in one sentence it's flaws are not getting to know the characters, sometimes cheesy, not a lot of plot, something that doesn't seem too out of the ordinary, and some slow scenes for a 2+ hour movie. This movie has seemed to change how we see movies and action in cinemas since it came out and I look forward to it's sequel. Though this movie doesn't seem like the type of movie that needs a sequel or can go in the direction for a sequel. So, despite it's flaws because of the action and entertainment I give it a 7/10.",7,0,0,7 July 2015
Cars," Too Slow, And Childish
","I'll be giving a popular Pixar movie a low rating. For one, I find it hard to believe that this movie is almost a decade old. You wonder where all the time has gone? I feel like 21st Century special effects haven't really changed. I remember seeing this movie in the movie theaters around the time it came out, and how popular new Pixar characters seemed at the time. But, this movie did not appeal to me when it came out. I'd see this movie a final time a few years later even as an adult. One of my adult friends who had this on Blu Ray, wanted us to watch this because of the high definition and nice special effects.This movie has never appealed to me. I also thought of this movie like Finding Nemo, a popular high grossing movie that has great special effects and came out a few years earlier. To me, they seem like movies I'd see with my nephews on a preschool channel, as if I were watching something like J.J. The Jet Plane, Or Thomas The Tank Engine. I feel like this movie would appeal to kids, they might not understand the story but just be obsessed with the characters but I don't see how a movie like this would appeal to adults? Maybe, the special effects.I also felt like this movie is a little slow paced. Lightning McQueen is a race car, but a lot of this movie takes place in the middle of nowhere. I was more anxious to see Lightning McQueen get to his race. It's also interesting how this is a kids movie, but there aren't any kid cars. There isn't really action either, Good Verses Evil. I heard there's action in the second one. Also, all the living things we see in the movie are vehicles, from cars, tractors, trains, and helicopters. There is not a single person or animal in the movie.We can think back to The Lion King. That movie doesn't have any people, just animals. I feel like Lion King would appeal more, and it's a great Disney movie. It feels like we all remember the Disney movies we saw as kids and frequently make references to them. That being said, I feel like it's fine to still have a kid inside you as you grow up. Doing so will allow you to keep up with younger kids and make you feel a kid at heart. Sometimes my Dad even feels like I am still childish, specifically for liking DragonBall Z as an adult. But, seriously I saw Resurrection F earlier this summer and loved it. Almost everybody in the movie theater were young adults. We can watch videos of people going over the series and they are guys with facial hair not like 10-year old kids. I also rented a movie a couple of years ago that remains my favorite movie, Junior High Spy. I still regularly watch scenes from that movie. It's the type of movie that entertains me, and even as an adult my eyes get glued to the screen each time I see it. The main character in that movie, Ricky Lazio is a totally awesome respectable character. His sidekick in the movie Jack is a naturally funny character. While the movie was independent and didn't have the best acting it can entertain me more than any other film.Sometime shortly after seeing Cars, I saw Monster House. That movie appealed to me way more. It's more interesting for me to see a Special Effects movie showing 3 Middle School friends keeping a watch on their neighborhood after believing the house across the street was possessed. Also, how you could tell while watching that movie that it was supposed to take place in the '80s or possibly early '90s. That's more interesting than watching a movie where everything is a vehicle, and a car trying to get to his race. Cars also is a long movie, almost 2 hours long, but it mostly feels slow paced so if you're like me you'll find it slow and childish. I leave it with a 2/10. Instead, I'd recommend the other movies I mentioned.",2,1,2,14 November 2015
Jurassic World," Dinosaurs Seemed More Realistic 22-Years Ago
","No doubt, one of the biggest movies ever made is the first Jurassic Park movie. That movie is still great to watch 22-years later. Sometimes, I'll put it on when I want to have a movie night. I'm sure a lot of us who have seen the first Jurassic Park have seen it more than once. Jeff Goldblum even talks about kids who watch Jurassic Park everyday on the bonus features. So, it is definitely an entertainer for younger audiences. Also, the computers in that movie don't seem that old. I mean, yeah we have flat screen computers and we don't use floppy disks anymore. Some of the icons in the first movie look a little old, but the way the computers work seem impressive even by todays standards and probably work better than we'd think a 1992 computer would work.Since the first one came out, they have made 3 more Jurassic Park movies. Since the 3rd one came out, I have long since heard of a 4th one coming out, even on IMDb and have heard different plots and Jurassic Park 4. They finally came up with a plot for the fourth film and rather than call it Jurassic Park 4, they changed it to Jurassic World. I feel like that this movie sequel, came up with the best plot for the franchise especially one that hasn't been used. Because, If you've seen the first two Jurassic Park films, you'll know they recreated the dinosaurs for tourism. They intended to have dinosaurs on display at a park, mostly for kids. This was John Hammond's idea. As you've seen on the trailers and the website. You'll know that Jurassic World is a fully functioning park that has been opened to the public for 10 years, so at this point people still enjoy touring the park, but it is no longer such a big deal having dinosaurs around.This movie will definitely keep you entertained and on your seat at the movie theater. It also seemed like everybody I talked to in the movie theater liked this movie. Though, everybody seemed to prefer the first two over this. But, they can all agree it was better than the 3rd as I don't care for that movie. I noticed a lot of things that if they thought more of, they could have made a much better movie and here are the reasons:1. My Title: Which is what I thought, despite this coming out 22-years later, the dinosaurs seemed more realistic, sounded more realistic, and even looked and acted more realistic in the first film. The dinosaurs would have been more entertaining if they kept them like the first. 2. At times it was cheesy: The characters and dinosaurs seemed a little cheesy some of the time. 3. The Characters Don't Entertain The Same As The Original Cast: I felt like Zach and Gray held up to Lex and Tim. But, the other characters from this movie, while entertaining they do not keep up with the characters we know from the original films: Allen Grant, Ellie Satler, Ian Malcolm, John Hammond, Mr. Arnold, Robert Muldoon, and Dennis Nedry. You'll prefer those characters over these ones. 4. We Coud Have Gotten To Know The Park Better: It's cool thinking dinosaurs are on display at a park for tourism. I feel like they should have taken more minutes showing us more what's at Jurassic World, along with showing us more of the dinosaurs.5. Less Sneaky/Scary: I still think of the first one as scary, but I didn't really think of this one as scary, though definitely entertaining. I feel like part of the reason, is because the dinosaurs seemed less sneaky as they do a good job in showing sneaky dinosaurs in the first film which makes it more scary. They seemed to take us more to the action. 6. The Island Looking Different: I felt like in this movie, Isla Nublar looked different and seemed less realistic than it did in the first film. The size also seems inconsistent, and while the park would change, the size of the island wouldn't. So, it didn't feel like we were on the Isla Nublar we knew in the first and I like the paddocks better in the first film. 7. The Music Not Quite As Good: We hear the main theme in the movie, but I think it would have been better if they played the music from the first film, or better background music. It would have been cool if they played the song from the first where Dennis Nedry shuts down the security systems. 8. Unanswered Questions: While these Jurassic Park movies seem canon and it has references to the first one, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. The only character that's the same is Dr. Wu. I feel like it would have been better if they did more references to the park, like explaining more the history of the park. They didn't seem to mention anything from the 2nd and 3rd films. But, they definitely should have answered how they were able to get Isla Nublar running after the incidents in the first 3 films. They also talked about engineering in this movie and referred to the dinosaurs as she, but were they intended to be all female like in the first movie, or did they realize they couldn't do it? 9. More Action: I feel like there could have been more action, especially with all the tourists at the park. So while this movie is a great film, there are so many things that should have been more thought out of, which would have made this a much better film holding up to the first. For entertainment purposes, I give it an 8. But, I'm subtracting a 2 for the things I mentioned above.",8,27,73,12 June 2015
Toy Story," Why The First Toy Story Is My Favorite
","So far they have come out with 3 Toy Story movies, and I also saw like a spooky Toy Story movie at RedBox and thought I heard that they are going to make a 4th one. It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1995 and was like the first fully computer animated movie, while nowadays almost all the animated movies we see are computer animated rather than the old days when they were digitally animated drawings. I miss those old cartoon movies. Anyway, Toy Story is definitely a classic movie. Kids today can watch the movie, and it probably won't seem like an old movie to them. They have made other Toy Story movies which seemed to earn more money than the first one. But, I will talk about why the first one is the best. The first one introduced us to the Toys in Toy Story, yeah they add some new toys in the later films, but this one is the first real introduction. It's always nice to remember the introduction of the characters we are familiar with in later films. Also, the later films seem to be more about adventures from the toys we know together in a group, in this movie it was mostly just the adventure of our favorite toys, Woody and Buzz. We see Woody's reaction to having Buzz as the new popular toy. Also, this one seems more about survival for Woody and Buzz, while in the other Toy Story movies it seems like it's less about survival and more about getting back to where they belong. Another reason to like this movie, from what I know while Pizza Planet is mentioned in other Pixar movies, this is the only one which shows them inside a Pizza Planet. I've always thought, that restaurant would be really cool to be at if it were a real restaurant. About Pizza Planet, I remember way back in 6th Grade in the scene when we see the Pizza Planet pick-up truck at the gas station and we hear the guys in it ask for directions to Pizza Planet, somebody in the classroom asked the teacher why would somebody who worked at Pizza Planet be asking for directions on how to get there? My teacher didn't know how to answer. In this movie we get to know Andy's original house and his neighborhood. We get to know the villain in this movie, Sid. The villains in the other movies are like the Chicken Man, Stinky Pete, and Lotso and some of his gang. I'm sure most of us could agree that our favorite bad guy in these Toy Story movies is Sid and let me give a few reasons to why we might like him the best. For one, Sid is Andy's next door neighbor. What's weird is the movie doesn't give any indication of whether Andy and Sid knew each other, so it can leave us with that question. Sid isn't like a bad guy, I mean he plays in the movie as a bad guy, but he seems to play a character we could imagine his age. I mean about a 13 year old boy who wears a T Shirt with a skeleton. He's aggressive and he likes torturing toys as a hobby of his, obviously not aware that the toys are alive. He likes explosives and stuff, and has a dark atmosphere in his room, along with mostly keeping his room locked. So, he's a G rated version of an early adolescent character who is supposed to be like the bad guy and he doesn't swear, talk about alcohol, drugs, or sex. He isn't like a criminal, just a scary kid with a dark atmosphere who likes to be the bad guy to toys he doesn't realize are alive. The climax in this movie also seems more exciting than the climax in the other movies. One thing we can find hard to believe, is how the toys have all these wacky adventures, doing things that somebody could easily notice, and nobody seems to be aware that the Toys are alive. Toy Story doesn't seem like The Velveteen Rabbit, but more like Toys who are having their own adventures, a little like The Lego Movie, where the Toys seem more alive than they seem like Toys. This is a great movie, I'd give a 9/10.",9,0,1,15 November 2014
Men in Black," Seriously, Almost 20-Years
","Man, this movie is almost 20-years old. Two-years from now it will be 20-years old. I'm sure almost everyone who sees this movie, could agree that it doesn't look old and would find it hard to believe that it's 18-years old, already. I remember seeing this movie in the movie theaters as a kid. I saw it two times during that summer, and was a fan of the movie. Despite movies like these being PG-13, they expect a lot of kids under 13 to watch these movies as they're definitely entertaining for younger audiences. It's entertaining for kids to see good verses evil, or saving the Earth from aliens. So, most kids would enjoy the movie.This is one of Will Smith's most memorable movies. It came out less than a year after a higher grossing movie he was in, Independence Day which also had to do with protecting the Earth from aliens. Interestingly, if you read the IMDb trivia, you'll see that Will Smith initially did not want to accept the role, but his wife encouraged him to take the part!! Good for her, Will Smith belonged in this movie and was like perfect for the role. He wants to be in great movies, and this is probably the second highest grossing one he did, next to Independence Day. Smith's most recent movie he did, or at least the most recent movie I heard of him starring in alongside his son. I haven't heard any movies either of them have been in since, is After Earth. Although, reading the plot of the movie it might almost sound like it would be a role that would fit him after this movie. I haven't seen that movie, and it has been critically bashed. Will Smith even considered it his worst movie he's ever done. If you look at most of the IMDb reviews for that movie, most of them are negative. A lot of people reviewing that movie, no longer see Will Smith's son Jaden Smith as a good actor from his performance in that movie. The only other movie I saw him in was Karate Kid, which was a great movie and he did well for the role. So, too bad Will and Jaden had to star in a movie that hurt their careers.Well, I've mostly been talking about the actor Will Smith and his career. But, why is he great in this movie? Well, Will Smith is a cool looking guy and he also looks funny too. He can play funny roles in his movies, as he plays a very comical role as Jay in this movie. This movie is not only an entertaining sci-fi movie, but a funny one and the action in this movie isn't as serious as the action in Independence Day, it is still a funny entertaining movie with great action.It is also cool to see the technology in the movie. The technology in it seems beyond what we even have today, 18-years later. It is also cool to think of a secret organization in NYC that protects the Earth from aliens, without us ever knowing anything is wrong, along with aliens being among regular looking people in a crowd, especially in NYC.So, if you're up for an entertaining funny movie with action. If you're up for seeing an awesome movie with Will Smith in it, then this is one to see. They've done two other Men In Black movies since this one came out. I don't really care for the other two. I saw the second one, and the 3rd one I saw part of but fell asleep. But, from what I saw with the 3rd one, it didn't entertain me. I feel like the second and third one take the movies a different direction we see from the first movie, and are also more cheesy. This movie can be cheesy at times.Having a movie of an organization protecting the Earth from aliens reminds me of a show that was popular a few years before the movie came out, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, that are more for kids than this movie though have the idea of protecting the Earth from aliens. While there are no references to Power Rangers in this movie that I am aware of, I think it would have been cool if an alien from the movie, looked like a monster from Power Rangers. It would have been cool if an actor from Power Rangers made a cameo, which we could relate to. It's cool if a movie has references to other things in pop culture. Oh well! Now that I've talked about the Power Rangers, I ought to mention that the show it was based on called Zyuranger in Japan is a better show, and more worth watching than Power Rangers.I guess, I've gone off topic and have probably talked more about Will Smith in the movie and went to other points. However, there isn't much more I can say about the movie if I don't want to talk about the plot which would count as a spoiler. To summarize briefly, this movie is a fun entertaining action movie with the plot of the M.I.B. a secret organization protecting Earth from the Extra Terrestrial, when they're threatening. It's cool to see the technology, and this is a movie Will Smith is great in.But, to conclude with movies about aliens coming to Earth. If you want to watch a movie I consider better and more entertaining, is a movie I feel is way underrated called Earth To Echo. I could even consider that movie, the greatest movie ever made!! Thanks for reading and sorry if this review wasn't helpful.",9,1,1,21 July 2015
Toy Story 2," Funny And Entertaining
","I think with the Toy Story movies, we have gotten to know the characters. The gang in Toy Story. We get to know them enough where they could be in a Toy Story TV show as we get to know them and their personalities. We seem to get to know the characters better in this film than any of the other Toy Story movies, and with a couple of characters added including Jessie and Bullseye that remain productive characters through the rest of the series. This movie is also one of the few sequels that does better than its predecessor and seems somewhat more popular. You can watch the movie and understand the feelings of the toys which is explained also in the 3rd movie. Yeah, kids play with Toys when they're young but normally stop playing with them when they're older. The Toy Story movies makes the toys we see come to life, and not in a creepy way or like the Velveteen Rabbit, but really seem like real characters with voices of actors we are familiar with. It's interesting how nobody ever really seems to suspect the toys are alive when they do a lot of things that people would have to notice. Somehow the toys can hide the fact that they're alive as seen in all 3 Toy Story movies.If you watch this movie, I'm sure you'll be entertained, as I find these Toy Story movies about the most entertaining films in Pixar, and so far there have been 3 Toy Story movies. I thought I even saw one Halloween movie for Toy Story at Redbox this past Halloween. So, the characters really are characters we get to know and that entertain us. It looks like they're coming out with a Toy Story 4. I was kind of hoping for a Toy Story 4 after the 3rd one as I like the continuation of the series with these toys. I was wondering if they would, because I thought I heard earlier that they weren't going to have a new film, not having anywhere else they could go with the plot. Well, apparently they are doing a new film. It's interesting how these Toy Story movies date back to 1995 and they don't age. We can be making sequels from them years later with the same characters and they work for us.Of all the Toy Story movies, I consider this one to be the funniest. I can really laugh when I see it, especially at the end with the outtakes. This is the only Toy Story movie I know of which has outtakes at the end. I know the first Toy Story didn't, I forget if the 3rd one did. But, seriously the outtakes at the end make this movie like twice as funny as it is during the end credits alone.I'm sure most of you here reading this review have seen this movie. I'm also sure that if you've seen Toy Story and Toy Story 3, you've also seen Toy Story 2. This one might be my second favorite in the series. I feel like the plot in the first movie works the best, but I feel like this one is the funniest in the series. I feel like Toy Story 3 has a somewhat similar plot to this one. I wonder where they'll go in the next film. I guess we will see in 2 years. I give it a 10/10. It is that well done.",10,0,1,9 March 2015
Super 8," Watch Earth To Echo Instead
","I saw the movie Earth To Echo yesterday, and then this movie came to my mind. A lot of people compare Earth To Echo to E.T., but I feel like lots of movies with aliens can be compared to E.T. whether they come in peace, or whether they terrorize Earth. The alien we seem to remember the most is E.T. and we remember the Amblin Entertainment Logo. I feel like this movie, Super 8 can be compared to E.T. as it is also a Stephen Spielberg film, it also is supposed to take place around the same time E.T. is supposed to take place, as this movie took place in the late '70s, E.T. took place in the early '80s. The character Joe Lamb at times seems to resemble Elliot. There are even other movies that deal with people and friendly Extra Terrestrials. There's The Last Mimzy. That movie is a good movie, but isn't talked about too often. I didn't really understand it when I saw it. There's also a Disney movie called Race To Witch Mountain. A movie with one of the more famous actors: The Rock, Dwayne Johnson. It also has Alexander Ludwig and Anna Sophie Robb, both blonde actors who seem to be well known for other movies. In Race To Witch Mountain, the aliens are human, and that's a fun action packed movie with good special effects.But, a lot of those movies this movie included it might be entertaining but it doesn't seem like something out of the ordinary. I have to say the same about Super 8, while it was a little entertaining it didn't seem too much like it was something out of the ordinary. This movie also made a lot of money, and I wish Earth To Echo did as well as this movie, as I feel like Earth To Echo is very underrated. For one, I feel like Super 8, wouldn't have done as well if it took place in the present day, so they have it take place in the '70s, specifically 1979. A lot of us wish we could go back to the past. We want to know more what the past was like in these eras in recent history, but before our lifetimes. I felt like a lot of this movie was long, a little slow at times, and again nothing we haven't seen. I'd like to talk about similarities to this and Earth To Echo:1. Both Deal With A Group Of Friends Middle School Aged, Mostly Boys2. There Is One Girl As Part Of The Group In Both Movies, A Natural Blonde, And A Crush On The Boys, In This Movie It's Alice. In Earth To Echo, It's Emma.3. Both Movies Are Adventurous. Earth To Echo Seems To Have More Adventure Like Traveling 20 Miles To The Desert. This Movie Seems To Have More The Action, If You Like Action Packed Movies.4. Both Movies Deals With Kids And An Alien Encounter, Only They And The Government Seem To Be Aware Of.5. The Government Works On Getting People Out Of Town In Both Movies, Keeping Their Secrets To The Public When It's Really Because Of The Alien.6. Both Movies Involve A Group Of Friends That Make Lots Of Videos Together.7. The Kids Drive Cars In Both Movies, And Seem To Be Good At It, As If You Haven't Driven You'll Need Practice In Places Like Parking Lots Before Driving Long Distances On Public Roads. It Doesn't Really Come Naturally.8. The Main Character In Both Movies, Joe In This Movie And Alex In Earth To Echo Seem Portrayed Somewhat The Same. I Guess Charles Could Be Portrayed A Little Like Munch Too.9. The Way The Alien Pulls Metal Things, Especially With The Spaceship In Both Movies Pulling Them Off The Ground Is Very Similar.You guys might even be able to think of other similarities I haven't mentioned. I mentioned on IMDb, similarities to another movie Specifically Home Alone and Blank Check. I'm sure anybody who watches those movies could notice the similarities, But, I prefer Blank Check which I feel is also underrated and a better movie. I feel like it's less dark, and more fun.While my review might not be helpful, and a lot of you seem to prefer Super 8 over Earth To Echo when I posted an IMDb message board about this earlier. If you're like me watch Earth To Echo, because I feel again that Super 8 isn't nothing that seems too out of the ordinary, like it's predictable. I also feel like this movie is a little slow at times, and nothing too memorable plot wise. I also feel like while it's a movie that will entertain you, it won't leave you like crying at the end and very happy as Earth To Echo can leave you feeling that way. I also feel like Earth To Echo is more fun with the adventure as since it's from a camera point of view, it almost feels like you're with the characters on an adventure.So, while this review might mostly be a comparison and more so advertising Earth To Echo. I'll say, the most entertaining thing about Super 8 was how it took place in the '70s. For some entertainment, I give it a 4/10.",4,0,2,9 September 2015
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," I Like This Better Than The First
","While not everybody seems to be a fan of the first two Home Alone movies, and it seems like everybody has seen them and remembers Macaulay Culkin mostly from when he starred in these movies. The second Home Alone didn't make as much money as the first Home Alone, and while neither of these movies are bad I'm surprised they made as much money as they did. It seems like movies that have tried to copy off the slapstick humor or even Home Alone theme haven't done as well since the first two. I mean one movie I like more than Home Alone and feel like it has more of a plot, is Blank Check. If you watch Blank Check, you'll notice numerous similarities. While I believe you can find the first two movies on TV all year around, you'll most definitely find them on TV during the Holiday Season on channels like ABC Family. I even have a friend who called the Holiday Season The Home Alone Season, as these films are on TV then and seem like the most popular Christmas films. When movie rental stores were open it was hard to rent Home Alone around Christmas. These Home Alone movies show a somewhat wealthy family getting ready for a vacation. I mean a family that is going on vacation with their extended family to Paris in the first film and Florida in the second. In both movies, the youngest Kevin doesn't get on the plane with them. They're movies that will put you in the Holiday Season spirit. I mean, I'm sure most of us have watched both Home Alone movies more than once. I always enjoy watching them during the Holiday Season as they get you into the Christmas Spirit, and you'll probably really remember the movie from past Holiday Seasons. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie outside the Holiday Season, because just like you likely wouldn't listen to Christmas music outside the Holiday Season, this movie makes the Holiday Season special, just gives you a feeling of it. But, what I like better about the second movie than first. I watched the first movie like six months ago and didn't enjoy it as much. Yeah, I'm sure I'll see it again especially during the holiday season, but I've noticed the first one seems somewhat dark, quiet, it seems mostly about Kevin, and there aren't many exciting scenes until the climax which we mostly remember the movie for. I like the 2nd one, because it is less quiet, I mean Kevin is around more people while in the first movie he was just in his quiet neighborhood that all his neighbors seemed to leave. In this one, he's in NYC the City that never sleeps, and NYC is really exciting and fun to be at during the Holiday Season as this movie clearly shows, and it shows Florida as not being as exciting to be at during the Holiday Season as like whenever they show his family in Florida, it's raining. Kevin has more excitement, as rather than just being left at home he is having his own vacation in a really nice hotel along with getting a limousine. It shows a toy store Duncan's Toy Chest, which is supposed to be off of FAO Schwartz. The traps in this movie are more funny and violent, I mean I crack up every time I watch this movie, and a lot of the traps would have left the burglars dead. So, it will likely keep you laughing as we see a face off between Kevin and the burglars. It's also a great movie to watch if you want to see the excitement of NYC during the holiday season. While this movie isn't like my favorite movie I give it a 10/10 because I think it is well done.",10,1,2,25 September 2014
Groundhog Day," How We Spend Everyday
","I only saw this movie once with my parents on Groundhogs Day, 2013. I didn't even know what the movie was about, not even knowing that the plot would be about a day repeating itself over and over. So, yeah while only seeing this movie one time, the plot is memorable along with the messages from the movie. To me personally, I can't think of any movie that has ever left me with a more positive message than this movie. Most movies will try to leave you with a good life message, but this movie has a very powerful message. Let's think about this movie in perspective trying not to use any spoilers. Well, Groundhog's Day is a holiday and one of the smaller holidays, a holiday most of us probably don't think much about except on February 2nd. It's not like Halloween which is coming up where we're already seeing decorations and costumes out, or Christmas where in 2 months we will see a lot of Christmas decorations along with hearing Christmas music on many radio stations. Groundhog's Day is mostly like a regular day where school doesn't get canceled or anything, and we find out on the news depending on if the Groundhog sees his shadow if we will have an early Spring or 6 more weeks of winter. In this movie, a weatherman known as Phil played by Bill Murray goes with his team to a certain town in Pennsylvania to do a report on the annual Groundhog's Day ceremony. After Phil stays with his team there another night because of a snowstorm, he notices he wakes up not to the next day, but the previous day Groundhog's Day, and the same thing seems to happen over and over and no matter how Phil spends his day, it just seems to continually repeat itself. Nobody else is aware of this time loop and it seems like everything goes the same way with the rest of the community during the day, only Phil can change the events happening by anticipating what is going to happen. So, basically the message this movie has taught me, is how we have everyday a period of 24 hours and we are the ones who decide how to spend the time each day. Most of the things we do each day are probably based on routine and habit, which is a good reason to get into good habits making somethings more natural to us. Obviously, we have countless opportunities of what we can do every single day with our time. Interestingly, we often times look back and are amazed at all the time that has passed from memorable moments, thinking the time flies. However, this movie shows how we spend are time in a single day and what we can do with all those opportunities, doing different things if a day keeps repeating itself, and getting different things from what we choose to do, like Phil chose to learn how to play the piano and get to know the community. So, basically each day is an opportunity in our life to do something, even things we've never done before. I personally am amazed at all we can do in a single day. I thought about that when I ran Cross Country in College, some days we would run 10 miles on scenic routes in the middle of nowhere on a day where we had classes, and a school night. We'd get back in time for dinner and to do homework. It was interesting to see myself in places I'm normally at on vacations in just an afternoon during a Cross Country practice along with getting good exercise and seeing the beautiful world. So, we might not be able to see the end from the beginning like Murray could. But, often times we don't take chances in life and miss out on opportunities we have because we are too afraid and don't try and unlike Phil some of those opportunities we have now, never come back. It's up to us to do what we can as I read earlier today on the internet, 'If You Think Adventure Is Dangerous, Try Routine It's Lethal.' The plot of a time loop has also been a plot in other movies like one more recently with Zachary Gordon, 'Pete's Christmas,' which wasn't nearly as good as this is. But, we just need to think about how we spend are time and what we do, and we will get results. Some of those results will last a lifetime. I'd give this movie a 10/10. While it's not one of my favorite movies, not like one I'd care to own. I give it a 10/10 because of the positive message it leaves us with.",10,1,2,29 September 2014
National Treasure," Fun, But Not Entirely Realistic
","Whenever I see this movie, it takes me back to the time this movie came out in late 2004. I seriously can't believe that was 11-years ago. This movie still works to watch today, and won't seem so old. They already came up with a National Treasure 2 and it sounds like a National Treasure 3 is in the works. Nicholas Cage doesn't seem like that big or favored of an actor anymore, and this movie seems like one of the most popular and memorable films he was in.This movie might seem like a cool idea, as it's an action movie but it's an action movie in a different direction, dealing with history and the Founding Fathers. While watching it, we might ask ourselves if there really is a hidden National Treasure, and if there really are clues like depicted in the movie? The movie will make the treasure and clues come to life, even though there probably isn't anything like it in either the first or second movie, and it just is a plot for entertaining purposes. Though while this movie might be a fun one to watch, complaints I see from this movie are its predictability and improbability. Watching this movie, while a lot of movies don't seem like they'd happen in real life, but might still seem realistic, for some reason this movie doesn't seem realistic. The action in the movie which makes this movie an entertaining action movie seems like action we've already seen before which I noticed while watching this the first time. You might be able to predict the plot. The enemies in these movies also don't seem realistic. We can wonder if this movie really is an educational movie, or if it's mostly giving fictional story lines from the Founding Fathers and taking us to various interesting landmarks.Another complaint I'd have about the movie which you might have too, is the characters. I mean if there's a National Treasure movie, we'd want these same characters to be in it. But, I feel like we don't get to know the characters well outside of their interest in history and the Founding Fathers, alongside with their main objective finding the treasure. It also goes that way with the love interest with the couples in this movie. I mean the movie didn't really show chemistry between those two, only added it because they were characters in the plot.Some years later, Nicholas Cage would be in another movie with a plot somewhat similar, but not about the Finding Fathers called Knowing. His interest in that movie is determinism, and he also has we can say a piece of paper from that movie that also leads to cracking out codes with big meanings. I feel like Knowing seems like a more realistic film than National Treasure and has a deeper mood. I actually prefer Knowing over National Treasure.The technology and gadgets in this movie are also cool. It reminds me of the technology from my favorite movie an Independent Canadian Film called Junior High Spy. While Junior High Spy had bad acting, I feel like that movie seems more realistic, and it has a more sneaky mood. My favorite movie scene, is a scene from that movie which is a simple scene where Ricky Lazio wanders around the mansion property with that sneaky music playing. It just adds a real mood to it, which I feel like we don't see in National Treasure.The clues in this movie remind me of recent movies like Earth To Echo, and Paper Towns. Two movies I consider underrated. I feel like those movies seem more realistic.So, in all this movie is an entertainer and fun movie to watch. But, it probably won't seem so realistic, especially the chemistry between the couple. I give this movie an 7/10. Sorry for mostly talking about the cons, but they're things that just stand out to me.",7,0,0,9 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good, But There Are Better Stories
","Harry Potter has no doubt, played a role in Pop Culture especially for books and movies. I find it very hard to believe as I'm sure most of you also find it hard to believe that this first movie came out almost 14-years ago. Where has all the time gone? I guess we're done with Harry Potter books since 2007, and Harry Potter movies since 2011. Harry Potter doesn't seem so much a part of Pop Culture anymore. I'd say the movies in Pop Culture now, are Jurassic World, Hunger Games, and Frozen. People remember Harry Potter, but I don't see that much Harry Potter franchise or people talking about it so much anymore. You will occasionally find the Harry Potter films on TV, like ABC Family where they occasionally have Harry Potter marathons.I think the story about how Harry Potter was written is interesting. Let's think about it, the lady who wrote Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling was poor and living off of welfare. The story she wrote was even rejected numerous times before finally being published. It obviously had been a huge success after hitting the bookshelves and with each new copy. There'd even be countdowns at bookstores right as the new books were coming out, back in the days before we had iPhones and when bookstores were more common. J.K. Rowling has become like the second richest lady in England, only behind the Queen Of England. I'd say that shows a story of success, and not giving up.Despite all this, while Harry Potter is a good story I'd say it's overrated and there are better stories. I definitely don't think that J.K. Rowling should be the second richest lady in England just for writing a kids book, but Harry Potter has obviously appealed to kids and adults, my aunt has read them. I have to say, there are better written fictional stories where the writer hasn't been as well known or made nearly as much money. I've grown up liking DragonBall Z. I even hear people talking more about DragonBall Z, and wearing DragonBall Z clothes than Harry Potter. I worked at Amazon, and I would often times see DragonBall Z franchise there more so than Harry Potter. That's a good, more action packed story of Good Versus Evil than Harry Potter. It also is a story with lots of varieties of character like Human/Saiyan compared to Muggle/Wizzard. I'd have a lot more fun having a DragonBall Z marathon than Harry Potter marathon.Japan has come up with other good stories. Like, I used to watch Power Rangers as a kid not knowing the show was using footage from a Japanese show, Zyuranger. It would have been hard to see Zyuranger back then in America. But, years later I have the DVDs, and I can't help but think about how much better Zyuranger is than Power Rangers. Japan also had another TV show come out in 1988 that is probably more remembered in Brazil called Sekai Ninja Sen Jiraiya, a good TV show. A lot of video game characters originated in Japan, like Zelda and Mario. In terms of writing Super Hero stories, no country beats Japan. No country also beats Japan in making video games.I also used to read the 39 Clues books which were my favorite books for awhile, and I'd say better than Harry Potter. I wonder if they'll make a movie out of them. But, one movie I feel is WAY UNDERRATED is a movie called Earth To Echo. That is such a happy adventurous movie, while it's not my favorite movie I'd consider it THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE. My favorite movie is called Junior High Spy. The main character in that movie, Ricky Lazio is a cooler character than Harry Potter. His sidekick Jack is a much funnier character than Ron. Ricky's love interest, Kylie is less stuck up, and more pleasant than Hermione.So, what I'm saying is while Harry Potter is a clever and good story it doesn't beat other stories mentioned above where the writers didn't become billionaires. So, Harry Potter is definitely overrated, and I'm saying it because of the movies. I feel like the movies do a great job in portraying Hogwarts, and bringing the Harry Potter characters to life. But, these movies while interesting are long dark 2+ hour movies where I feel like can be slow at times and have lots of Go Pee moments. A lot of the Harry Potter movies don't entertain me that much. They're not like DragonBall Z, where I could flip through scenes in the DVDs, and then want to keep watching. It's still entertaining.So, while this review might be more of Harry Potter as a whole I'll briefly talk about the movie. I like this movie, as it takes us back to the introduction of Harry Potter/Hogwarts. It brings us back to the excitement of the introduction, and when the characters were younger and had higher voices. Also, when they had the House Cup which seems forgotten in the later books/movies. I also feel like the climax in this movie is like the most exciting climax, well the climax in the 4th is pretty exciting. The chess scene, and finding the right key were exciting scenes. This movie is truly a great fun way to introduce us to the first year at Hogwarts and the Harry Potter excitement. I'd probably now give the movie a 7 or 8, but since I put a 9 on this movie many years ago, I'll leave it at 9.",9,0,2,2 September 2015
War of the Worlds," Arguably Dakota Fanning's Most Memorable Film
","I haven't seen this movie in a very long time. I saw it two times back in 2005 and 2006. That being said, I find it very hard to believe how long ago that was? It doesn't feel that long ago, and this is definitely a movie you'd remember being so graphic and with all the intensity. Dakota Fanning used to be a very talked about child actress. She was like 10 when she was in this movie. This will make some of you feel old, but Dakota is 22 now. I can just be like, 'huh' when I put into consideration how long it has really been. I also ought to say that Dakota's younger sister Elle Fanning seems older in a lot of the movies she's played in, than a lot of the movies like this we remember Dakota in. Elle Fanning seems more talked about and she seemed to mature pretty fast. She was like 12, in two movies we might have seen her in, Super 8 and We Bought A Zoo, again being older than Dakota when she played in this movie.Going on with the movie, alien invasions of Earth not coming in peace but intending to destroy the planet have long since been movie and book plots. This movie shares the name with a radio broadcast done during The Great Depression where aliens from Mars were terrorizing New York City. They announced before the radio broadcast that it was fake, but some people tuning in later believed it, and some of them even evacuated.This movie is probably supposed to be about that alien invasion, and while the trailer makes it look like the aliens are from Mars, I don't think they were supposed to be from Mars. We've searched Mars and it seems evident there isn't life on Mars. I don't think the planet the aliens are from is ever mentioned or even how far out in the universe it is?Basically, this movie is about a divorced Dad played by Tom Cruise, Ray Ferrier. His son Robbie and daughter Rachel are visiting. There's an alien invasion while they're visiting and the action mostly just focuses on the family. If I can remember correctly, almost every scene besides the introduction and ending were scenes the main characters were in, mostly Ray, as if it was a movie from their Point Of View. They always seem to be at the center of the action. It's also interesting how as destructive as the aliens are worldwide, there are some areas where it feels like they didn't strike when we get to a different location.All in all, this is a memorable movie, graphic and violent. I wouldn't entirely recommend it though, because it wasn't too good either. The first half seems okay, but the second half isn't too good. The second half seems a little more sad and graphic than entertaining action, or humor. Also, I feel almost as if there's no real plot besides a family and world trying to survive an alien invasion, and we don't get to know the family too well, but they seem like your typical family in that situation. Though, the tripods in the movie were scary and the noise they make is scary and memorable.One other thing is this movie shares some similarities with a more recent movie about an alien invasion The Fifth Wave with Chloe Grace Moretz. One similarity is the aliens turning off the power. I think that movie was better written, better explained, and more entertaining than War Of The Worlds. I'd recommend that movie instead. For some entertainment value and for the wow feeling of this movie, I leave it with a 5.",5,0,1,4 October 2016
The Lion King," Most Positive Message Of Any Disney Film I've Seen
","I saw this movie just a few days ago on an old VHS tape my parents have at home, and absolutely loved it!! It is a great story and a feel good movie that you'll likely feel really happy seeing. What is great about this movie, well I feel like most Disney movies try to leave you with a good message. This movie has a few powerful messages, like one Timon and Pumba's song Hakuna Matatata, a message about no worries which helps Simba forget about what he had just faced earlier. It's really nice to hear messages about not worrying as songs like that help us forget some of our own worries. The other message this film leaves us with is responsibility. Simba gets used to an easy life and no longer considers being king, like he was looking forward to earlier in the movie as his responsibility. Can Simba be persuaded to go back to Pride Rock, or should he just continue living his easy worry free life with Timon and Pumba? So, yeah it leaves us with a positive message and it is in all a beautiful film. A film with just animals, there are no people in it. We get to see very beautiful scenery, especially in the beginning of the movie and lots of animals. The songs are really nice songs you'd want to listen to, and there is a great story involved. It's also great how this movie isn't computer animated like almost all the animated movies that come out nowadays are. It's nice to just see really great drawings of Africa and wildlife. It's been a huge success as it's one of the highest grossing movies ever and it even has more home video copies sold than any other film. It's timeless, and I'm sure most of you reading this review have seen it. If you haven't seen it, then see it it's a must see. This is also a movie to show your kids, as I'm sure this movie will live on 100 years from now.",10,0,0,22 September 2014
The Blind Side," Good Story, But Not Worth 2+ Hours Of Your Life
","I haven't seen this movie in 4 years. The last time I remember seeing this movie was when I was on a Cross Country team at college before a Cross Country race, just watching a motivational movie. I saw the whole movie one other time at the movie theater earlier and while my parents own a copy, it's not a movie I'd put on if I wanted a movie night. I think this movie is way too overrated. Before I talk about the cons for this movie, I'll talk about the pros. It's by all means a good story, I mean it would be somewhat interesting to read an article about the true story from the movie. It's interesting to think of the real story of Michael Oher, now a professional football player. I hope this doesn't count as a spoiler, but since it's based on a true story and we frequently hear this movie being referenced in pop culture, I'm sure almost all of us are aware that this movie is about, A black guy who went from being homeless, to being adopted by a rich Christian Caucasian family, and with his football skills, Oher eventually becomes a famous football player. Other pros for this movie, is it is somewhat nice to see a normal looking community and normal family activities. Bullock also did a great job playing Leigh Anne Tuohy. It's also a great Christian story, seeing how Oher goes into a Christian Private School, and how a Christian family welcomes him over. So, a very positive act done by a Christian family. But, here are some of the cons from this movie. A lot of the story has to do with what I wrote above, and while there is more to it than what I mentioned and could be summarized, the movie is a little over 2 hours long. It would have been better if it were just cut down to an hour and a half to explain Michael Oher's story. From what I remember, a lot of the scenes in the movie are slow showing how a family accepts Oher into their family, just showing typical family life and football games/practices where not many interesting things happen, at a slow pace. What else is also annoying about this movie, is it seems like the characters in this movie are obsessed with Michael Oher. I mean in almost every scene Oher isn't in, the characters from the school administrators to Sandra Bullock are basically just talking about Oher as if they had nothing else or nothing better to talk about. Now to mention a few other cons, a lot of us agree that S.J. is an annoying kid which is true. SJ really seems to look up to his adopted brother Oher, we could have gotten to know S.J. a little better other than those details, like school. Let's talk about S.J.'s sister, Collins. She's a character we hardly get to know. She doesn't seem to care at all or mind how the mom just invites some random guy over at their house too live with them and eventually adopt him, like she wouldn't care if her mom did or didn't do what she did. From what I remember, we did not get to know the Dad, Sean Tuohy too well either. The movie seemed mostly about Leigh Anne Tuohy and Michael Oher, and then the next main character S.J. So, the movie shows typical slow family activities of the life of a guy who became a great football player. It's not something that I'd think most people would want to spend two hours of their life watching. There's a 2+ hour movie that came out months later that is also a more motivational movie, a movie with more motivational action scenes, a more funny movie, and not to mention the main character in that movie is black like in this movie. The movie I'm referring to is Karate Kid. I feel like Karate Kid is a much better film and should have earned more money than The Blind Side as I feel like there's a lot more interesting things to Karate Kid from the scenes in China, to showing Martial Arts. However, that movie did do really well in the cinemas, but not as well as Blind Side as Blind Side made over $250 Million. There was even a good inspirational story which I feel like is a better story than this that also shows a Christian's faith which came out a little over a year later called, Soul Surfer. I feel like that story is more motivational and inspirational. One other movie I once saw with my Cross Country team is Cool Runnings. The main characters in that movie are Jamaican and it's a great story showing Jamaican guys making the first Jamaican bobsled team, it's also more funny too and fast paced to watch. So, I'm just saying that a lot of these things in this movie aren't worth so much of your time and Hollywood seems to make a big deal about Bullock's performance and of this inspirational true story. I give this movie a 4/10.",4,1,2,18 October 2014
Space Jam," Fun/Entertaining
","This is one of the movies I would watch as a kid. It seems like a lot of the people on these IMDb message boards and reviews for this movie Space Jam are around the same age I am and remember watching this movie when we were younger. My parents still have this movie on VHS, and I remember giving it to my older sister for her 17th Birthday, but I don't think she ever really watched it, or maybe once. Whenever I watch this movie, it's a trip down Memory Lane. I still remember it pretty well from when the movie was new and when I was a kid watching it on VHS.Here is what makes this movie interesting. Well, there are lots of sports movies including certain sports movies for kids. From what the internet tells us, this movie is still the highest grossing basketball movie to date, and keep in mind this movie is almost 20-years old. In this movie, we get to see real basketball players who play themselves. Obviously, the main one Michael Jordan. We also have Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Mugsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, and Shawn Bradley. We also have Bill Murray in this movie who plays a character with the same name, but not supposed to be the same person.What makes this movie entertaining. Well, Michael Jordan was talked about more in the '90s. He doesn't seem talked about so much anymore. But, I think that was nice of him to star in a fun entertaining movie where the target audience was kids. Kids being able to see their hero in an entertaining 1.5 hour movie. This movie wasn't a documentary featuring him or a movie about his life, but a movie for entertainment. Yeah, it's a movie featuring Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes. We've all seen the Looney Tunes cartoons, Merry Melodies and those cartoons are from decades ago, but we still remember the characters and the sound effects including the sound effects where a character like Wile. E. Coyote falls off a cliff. That sound effect sounds like a bomb being dropped from a military plane. It's just cool seeing a plot involving Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, and the movie will definitely keep us entertained and our eyes on the screen.So, I enjoy watching this movie. It still entertains me as an adult. With sports movies that have been made and ones that will be eventually make for kids, we can ask which one will come out next? I believe there is a Space Jam 2 in the works. But, if they could make a certain sports movie for kids, this is one I'd love to see becoming a film even though I doubt it will become one. The funniest book I've read in my entire life is a 1993 book called, The Toilet Paper Tigers by Gordon Korman. I crack up while reading it and in terms of reading I'd recommend it for you if you like reading. With coming up with new ideas for sports films, that would be awesome if they did a well done version of that book into a movie.To conclude, if you want to relive your childhood days, or the days when Michael Jordan was a bigger athlete, you can watch this film. You most likely will consider it Fun/Entertaining!!",9,3,4,20 June 2015
The Sixth Sense," Slow, Entertaining Thriller
","It amazes me to think about how old this movie is. It's from 1999. This is most likely the actor Haley Joel Osment's, most memorable film. I haven't seen him in films in awhile, and if you look at recent pictures from him, you'll think about how he was a cute kid, but he hasn't aged well. That being said, I'm a little older than Haley Joel Osment and if you saw me you'd think I look young for my age. Like there are employees at work who once guessed I was 14, and then said I look 18. 14 is a little too young, I don't think I look that young. But, to people who feel old one thing is for sure and that's not all of us age the same. Some look old for their age, while some look young. You could look at names of celebrities who don't age online and celebrities from Modern Family would come up, like Sofia Vergara/Gloria, and Sarah Hyland/Haley. You'd also see names like Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. But, if you look at celebrities who have aged badly, you'd see Haley Joel Osment's name.OK, talking about aging was off topic. But, I just wanted to leave a random message on an IMDb movie review. That's if you're feeling old, remember there's nothing you can do about your age. How old you are since when you were born. What you do with your body might age you faster or slower. But, we are not as old as we might think we are. Because, apparently not everybody ages the same.So, to get to my point this movie is a great Thriller. It was like the top film back in 1999 next to The Phantom Menace. It's been well received and well remembered. It also more than likely is the director M. Night Shyamalan's most memorable/successful film. Some of his more recent films like The Last Airbender, and After Earth haven't done well. Another film of his is coming out tomorrow, The Visit. That film looks entertaining, but looks like it will be more cheesy and like it's a modern version of Hansel And Gretel. That film like this film is also taking place in my home state and has scenes in Philadelphia. Man, I don't hear about these movies in the news being filmed locally, or see any sign of a film crew around. I wonder if I could have been an extra in one of these movies? They show a scene in The Visit at the train station in Philadelphia 30th Street Station. I've been there lots of times, but never heard of a film project over there. It's interesting to think where movies have been filmed, and how the director of both movies who grew up around Philadelphia has his movies from there.So, I've mostly been off topic. But, what makes this movie great. Well, up until a couple of years ago I hadn't seen this movie for more than a decade. I remembered it, but it wasn't a movie I cared to see. I mostly remembered the movie being dark and depressing. Like yeah, even if you haven't seen it you more than likely are familiar with the line, 'I See Dead People' from this movie. Also, we see the character played by Haley Joel Osment sad in a lot of scenes including deleted scenes. It almost seemed like a young, lonely, isolated boy who had problems that wouldn't go away, and focusing on dead people. Also, it seemed a little like a quiet dark movie, which it is. This isn't a fast paced horror movie. But, it will definitely keep you entertained. My perceptions from this movie have changed from the last couple of times I saw it. I even last saw this movie when I was having a depressing day myself, when I normally don't have depressing days. The movie definitely helped put me in a better mood, and I was able to laugh at a couple of scenes. I got myself into the movie both times I saw it, and it's not as depressing of a movie as I remember. This movie also is a clever story. Being able to see dead people. Though, if you look the the story wasn't something M. Night Shyamalan came up with on his own. He came up with the idea from an episode of Are You Afraid Of The Dark. He already would have been an adult when that episode aired, and got his idea from a kids TV show. Though this movie won't feel like it's a kids movie even when the main character is a kid, and even if it was inspired by a kids TV show. It will also seem more serious than a TV show like Ghost Whisperer, which also involves a girl being able to see the dead.I ought to say, I won't tell you what it is, even if you haven't seen it you probably already heard of the twist. This movie is famous for a Twist At The End. Almost nobody who saw this movie for the first time and wasn't already told what it was, could figure the twist out that's revealed at the end. There are even clues leading to the twist, but they most likely won't seem apparent to anybody who doesn't already know what it is. I heard the movie coming out tomorrow, The Visit is supposed to have an ending Twist, and I'm not sure what it is?I'll give this movie an 8/10. It's not my favorite movie, but it is still an entertaining movie to watch.",8,0,1,10 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Feels More Canon
","Before I talk about the movie, I'd like to talk about canon-related material. A lot of times if we see sequels to a movie, or sometimes like Star Wars they do prequels. A lot of times even while those stories might fit in with the original story, there are slight inconsistencies and plot holes. A small example of that is in the first Home Alone Kevin is supposed to be 8, and in the second one which is supposed to take place a year later, he says he's 10.Now, going on with story lines even though this might be off topic, let me talk about another long series which I've grown up watching and it's DragonBall Z. People who watch that series knows that it consists of DragonBall, DragonBall Z, DragonBall G.T., movies as part of the series, and recently DragonBall Super in Japan. When we think of the series as a whole we probably think of DragonBall Z. DragonBall Z came out first in America, just like how Star Wars started with episodes 4-6 instead of 1-3. I read that the reason they started showing episodes of DragonBall Z in America before DragonBall is because they felt like the latter series would attract more viewers. With the success of DragonBall Z, they brought over DragonBall.Now, anybody who is a fan of the series knows there are inconsistencies from prior episodes that either seem forgotten or no longer cared about. A few examples is DragonBall is canon to DragonBall Z. DragonBall G.T. is non-canon and while some of us might consider it part of the original storyline, it wasn't quite as good and popular and even the writer of DragonBall, Toriyama doesn't consider it canon. Even in DragonBall there are things that seem forgotten, like Launch who is a main character in DragonBall and only in filler in DragonBall Z. The tails and giant apes/oozarus almost seem forgotten after the Saiyan Saga. Also, with the numerous power ups, we'd think the characters should easily destroy Earth by any move they make in the latter episodes. A few others is the Red Ribbon Army was portrayed differently in the Trunks, Androids, and Cell Saga than in DragonBall. Also after the Frieza Saga, it seemed harder to write new enemies over Frieza and power ups as in Season 4 there were numerous new enemies before finally ending with Cell. I'll conclude by saying there are various movies, while they take us to the series, most of them couldn't take place in the main storyline, even when the main storyline has inconsistencies.So, sorry to waste your time talking about DragonBall when this is for Star Wars. But, the point I'm making is Star Wars has 7 movies and episodes that came out. I've long since heard of a new Star Wars movie coming out, and originally heard they were planning on having it be a prequel, like Old Republic. Instead, they just wrote an Episode 7.With the 7 Star Wars movies that have come out, there have also been numerous Star Wars books that have come out, Star Wars video games, and Star Wars T.V. shows. With all those stories, fans of the movies might notice some inconsistencies with other stories and wonder if they're supposed to be Canon but they still take us to, 'A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far Far Away.' Just like how the movies in DragonBall Z work even if they're not part of the main storyline.The reason I've brought this up, is because it makes sense to bring this up with such a big storyline. When we think of Star Wars, a lot of us probably think more of the characters from episodes 4-6 rather then 1-3. A lot of people are unhappy with the Star Wars prequels and notice inconsistencies. Some people even wonder if they should watch the Star Wars episodes in chronological order? I'll tell you, I've done that and episodes 1-3 will feel canon to each other, but not so canon to episodes 4-6. This movie feels more canon to the later Star Wars episodes than the first trilogy will seem canon to the second, even though more time has probably passed from episodes 6 to 7 than episodes 3 to 4. While I was in the movie theater, as I actually saw this on a Disney cruise. The audience members clapped every time we saw characters and references to the original Star Wars movies, including a scene we saw in the trailer seeing Darth Vader's burnt mask.I went into the movie with low expectations feeling that this was going to be an overrated film that makes lots of money continuing the Star Wars series. I also saw lots of your complaints about this being like a rewrite of episode 4 with new characters. It's been a long time since I've seen episode 4, but I did not see it as a rewrite. It felt like more of it's original story. It had great action and was entertaining the whole way through, that I'd give it a 10. It seemed to be faster paced than a lot of the other Star Wars movies, and it's nice to see the characters from the Star Wars movies we remember most, played by the same actors over 30-years later. They still act like the way they did in the original movies. I haven't heard of an episode 8 in the works, but due to the success of this film and where the movie ended there should be an episode 8.So to briefly summarize what I wrote. I wrote this long review to explain how it feels more canon. I also mentioned how I went in with low expectations, but found this movie so entertaining that I'd definitely recommend it!! I'm excited for an episode 8 after seeing how good this movie was.",10,2,38,6 January 2016
Incredibles 2," Incredible Movie!!
","Ever since I saw the first Incredibles, I have been hoping and waiting for a sequel. The first Incredibles leaves a hint for a sequel, and it seemed like a good enough movie for a sequel. After almost 14-years they finally did a sequel. This sequel starts where the last one left off. Despite years having passed since the first movie came out, the cast hasn't aged. This movie also has good direction and writing, as I've seen sequels that seem off from their predecessors, however this movie seems to flow in the same direction as The Incredibles. It will feel like a good continuation of the story. It will be nice to see a Super Hero family we remember so well from 14-years ago, and a family that is like as iconic as The Simpsons, (also a family that doesn't age), on screen again in action. I'm sure you'll be very entertained by the action!!I ought to say that the baby Jack Jack has more of a role in this movie. What I think is probably the most memorable scene from the original movie, would probably be the bonus scene on the menu, 'Jack Jack Attack' with Jack Jack and the babysitter, Kari. You'll remember that scene with Jack Jack in this movie.I felt like this movie had a better plot and better direction than the original Incredibles. You'll feel for the characters and The Incredibles do a great job in presenting a super hero family that also at times tries to be normal, and has certain normal things to work out which can seem like real life.If you liked the first Incredibles, definitely watch this one. I'm sure you'll be entertained by the action. You probably would agree with me that unlike a lot of other sequels this movie seems On Parr with the first one. Get it On Parr? The Incredibles last name is Parr. After seeing this movie, I'm hoping for an Incredibles 3!! Of all the Pixar characters, I feel like they are the most worthy characters for a sequel. I give it a 10/10!!",10,4,14,17 June 2018
Spectre," James Bond Forever
","When we think of secret agents, the first one that probably comes to our mind is James Bond. The second one who probably comes to our mind is Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible, played by Tom Cruise. There are 5 Mission Impossible movies Tom Cruise stars in since 1996. Though, it seems like they are not as popular as the James Bond 007 movies. James Bond has been a popular well-known movie character for over 50 years. I haven't seen enough James Bond movies. I for one wonder if the movies are supposed to be canon? If they're supposed to all be stories that have happened in James Bond's life since the '60s. Maybe James Bond is supposed to be like The Simpsons, a show that has aired for 26-years, continues to take place in the present day, and the characters never age?I've been to a Spy Museum in Washington D.C. It's a fun museum to be at, and considering how we normally think of James Bond as a spy, a lot of the things there are related to James Bond. We can wonder how much real spies go through, if it's ever similar to what we see in movies? I'm sure most of us can agree that the action we see in movies like these James Bond movies, only happens in movies and never real life.I feel like I can't say that much about this James Bond movie that wouldn't count as a spoiler or hasn't already been said. I mean, some of you might be James Bond fans, knowing the stories really well. It seems like James Bond, while not only the amazing secret agent is also the charming character. The way he looks and walks displays his masculinity. He also always seems charming among the ladies. These James Bond movies also always seem to take place in other countries, never the United States. We also always see elegant backgrounds in these movies.The action might be predictable, especially if you've seen other James Bond movies. But, predictable or not this movie was awesome. I saw SkyFall in the movie theaters 3-years ago, and while I enjoyed it I barely remember it as I haven't seen it since. I felt like this movie entertained me more and was more memorable. This movie was a long movie, like 2.5 hours. I feel like the ideal movie time is 1.5 hours. It feels like these bigger movies that come out like: James Bond, Avengers, Harry Potter, and Hunger Games always have to be at least 2 hours long. But, I feel like they can be shortened to an hour and a half where we might feel we'd have more time to watch them. Though, I thought of this whole movie as entertaining. Every action scene was entertaining.I'd recommend this James Bond movie. I liked this movie better than the highest grossing movie of the year, Jurassic World. A girl I watched this movie with also thought it was better. It seems to have more of the fun entertaining action, rather than action of people, dinosaurs, and survival.I'd give it a 9/10. I'd give it a 10/10 if the movie were like an hour shorter. I'd definitely recommend it!!",9,9,23,7 November 2015
Jurassic Park," Great Movie That Never Gets Old
","It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1993. You can watch it years later, and it most likely will not feel old to you. The technology in the movie doesn't even seem that old along with the idea of cloning dinosaurs, bringing them back to life. This is also a great movie to watch if you have friends over. I'm sure they've seen it and would love to see it again. It's just a fun, adventure, scary, and happy movie to watch. It's not like a cheesy movie of dinosaurs coexisting with people, but more a movie showing how people figured out how to bring dinosaurs back to life and tried to have an attraction for people at an amusement park known as Jurassic Park. I'll tell you that if there was such a place as Jurassic Park, I'd go if I could as I would think it would be worth it to see dinosaurs in person if the park was secure as it was supposed to be in the movie. The effects they did for the dinosaurs are also really great effects, even in today's standards. The action in this movie will also keep your eyes glued to the screen. So, while this is a great movie it still has its flaws. For one, basically all the areas you see in the movie, except maybe where Dennis Nedry had a brief scene are uncivilized areas, areas most of us probably aren't familiar with. The park was supposed to be on it's own island called, Isla Nublar I forget exactly where it was supposed to be, but obviously it was a park far from civilization as even the people who would want to go to the island would have to do a lot to travel there and as Alan and the others were supposed to be spending a weekend at the park, they don't show things like beds or rooms they could be sleeping in, and it's interesting how the park seemed fully staffed, but almost everyone besides the main characters seem to leave by the time the action starts. Other flaws, well I think the movie had great acting but the actors don't seem like your everyday people. I mean they seem to wear clothes that aren't your everyday clothes, but clothes that work in a dinosaur world. They also don't seem too traumatized after going through some of the most scary experiences you can go through. I mean let's talk about the kids Tim and Lex for example. I feel like none of the kids they've shown in any of the Jurassic Park films seem realistic. But, looking at Tim and Lex, I mean how cool would it be for them to be like the first kids in the world having experiences with dinosaurs being able to see them in person. That doesn't seem like a really big deal for them, they seem mostly there for the tour and we see how Tim mostly seems interested in books especially about dinosaurs, and Lex is interested in computers. But, we don't really hear much about their lives outside of Jurassic Park, I mean obviously they'd have school and stuff which they don't talk about. Also, those two have lots of injuries and go through horrifying experiences and again not really showing signs of trauma or pain and in the next scene they are like telling jokes. The ending scene at Jurassic Park which I won't spoil also seems unrealistic. So, despite these flaws the movie is by all means a great movie, one you can watch over and over again and that never gets old. You could even consider some of the flaws I mentioned, and not that it makes it a bad movie, but questions people like me will have left unanswered. Overall, I give this movie a 9/10. It's a great movie, but some of its flaws keep it from being a 10.",9,2,2,7 October 2014
The Simpsons Movie," C Minus
","It's been awhile since I've seen The Simpsons Movie, like 5 years. No doubt, The Simpsons was a great show growing up, that I can't believe is still running for 25 years. The Simpsons used to be my favorite TV show 15 years ago, I don't watch it too often now and I have some of the Halloween episodes on DVD which I got from the Supermarket. However, it seems like almost everybody prefers the older episodes, pre-2000. It just seems like the newer episodes don't have as much appeal as the older episodes. I remember watching a Simpsons YouTube video in it with Justin Bieber from an episode and I saw how the top comment said, 'R.I.P. The Simpsons 1989-1998.' Yeah, those were the good old episodes, even if you watch the TV show on TV nowadays they don't often times show those episodes on TV anymore. If they did start showing the older episodes on Fox, I'm sure The Simpsons would have more viewers than they do now, so I think Fox should start showing the older episode reruns. We can ask what makes this movie not as good as it could be. Well, they try to be funny as obviously the newer Simpsons episodes try to be funny. But, while the movie might have some funny scenes, it seems like the movie mostly tried to be funny and tried to show slapstick humor that a lot of us probably didn't think was too funny. It seems like the most memorable scene from this movie was when Bart Simpson was skateboarding naked. I felt bad for Bart after that scene seeing his sad face. What made this movie not too good, well there didn't seem to be much characterization in this movie. We didn't seem to see as much of the regular characters as we see on the show. They had brief scenes, but nothing much about them. In the show and especially older episodes they had humor as we got to know basically all the characters in Springfield from a single episode about them. It seems like the whole plot in the movie was how Springfield was covered in a dome because of pollution, and the people in the community tried to get out of the dome and protect their own city from the government, making the government and Arnold Schwarzenegger look like bad guys and you kind of feel bad for the people of Springfield and Homer Simpson even if it was meant for comical purposes rather than serious purposes. What was really good about this movie. Well, I've seen TV shows made into movies and often times the movies don't make it look like an episode from the TV show. Instead, they add things that are quite different from the TV show. An example I'm thinking of is The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie. I remember how while they did use the same characters and tried to have the same kind of plot they had on the TV show for a movie, it was too different from the TV show and seemed to lose it's appeal that way and didn't follow the TV show as much as the Power Ranger World Tour Show did so the World Tour Show was better. So, enough about Power Rangers. The Simpsons Movie looks like it's an episode rather then it's own independent movie. We see the same characters and the characters act the way they do on the show. We see similar scenes and types of humor from the movie as we do on the show. We also see things like a message across the screen as we do on the show making it look like you're watching The Simpsons on Fox. So yeah, it's great that it stays along with the show, not just changing the themes around. However, it could have been better written as I heard that this movie was rewritten so many different times. I don't know what plot could have made it better, but probably one where it's more about the characters and less about what's happening in Springfield. Overall, I'd give this film a 7/10. In school often times 70-79 would be a C. I'd have to give it a 70 where it still passes, but barely. I almost gave it a 6/10, but I think it's fair to give this movie a 7/10, but still a C-.",7,0,0,18 September 2014
