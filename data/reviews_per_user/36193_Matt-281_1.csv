Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Fan, disappointed, yet optimistic
","OK, where do I start?  As a Star Wars fan I was disappointed,  but I'm not going to call it awful.  Of course I hated Jar Jar Binks.  I realize that he was added to make TPM appeal to kids but kids are going to like it anyway simply because its friggin' Star Wars.  Hopefully he will not be in the next installment.I thought the actors that had a lot of talent were underused,   Samuel L. Jackson, Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, etc. I was impressed by Darth Maul.  He should have been used more as well.  I especially liked the Pod Racing scene, and definitely the fight scenes. The special effects were incredible, though FX do not make a movie.  One would think that someone like Lucas who is so deeply engulfed in film lore would concentrate some more on things like acting, drama, plot, etc. and not rely so much on special effects.  I mean the guy's an outsider of mainstream Hollywood, yet he relies heavily FX in his movies (yeah I know it's a SW movie and it has to be loud and pretty).  I am an admirer of Lucas however because I agree with his opinions of Hollywood.It hurts me to say these things about a Star Wars movie but I was disappointed. I am, however, optimistic that the next two will be a lot better..as long as the acting is better, there's more screen  time for McGregor and company, no fart jokes, no Jar Jar, no all around juvenile humor or preteen antics, and last but not least that same old Star Wars feeling.",Null,0,1,8 June 1999
