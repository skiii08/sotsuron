The Avengers," Fantastic Movie! Loved Every bit of it!
",First off there is never a dull moment in this movie. Something interesting is always happening. It is the perfect blend action and comedy. Every character is perfectly cast and does an outstanding job. Would recommend everyone sees this film before they die. By far one of my favorite movies. I have seen this movie multiple times and it has me on the edge of my seat every time. I love every single Marvel movie and cannot wait to see what they do with not only The Avengers but also each individual superhero's independent film franchise. Every actor is perfect for their role which makes it hard to choose a favorite. Fantastic Movie!!!,10,3,7,22 April 2015
