Lucky Number Slevin," Mostly harmless... apart from one scene
","another warning about SPOILERS only read this if you already saw it!....I was drawn into the theatre by TV advertising and I keep telling myself I'll never fall for THAT one again. I had heard that you need to really focus on the opening sequence which was a mistake. I noticed the kid's resemblance to Hartnett which basically gave the sting away for me.So laden with this fact, the meat of the film left me slightly cold although there is some neat dialogue and a few noteworthy camera tricks.It was the final 20 minutes that really got my attention and as the denouement approaches there's a memorable scene between Freeman and Sir Ben where two legends are cracking sparks off each other to light up the screen. It was maybe 2, 3 minutes but worth the admission price on its own.Anyway then come the (for me) less than shocking revelations and Bruce Willis in a droopy moustache.To summarise, I thought it was OK, a bit so-what , but enlivened by excellent actors.",6,2,10,9 March 2006
