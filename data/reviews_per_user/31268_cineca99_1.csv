Black Swan," Swan Lake in a Kafkaesque way.
","The way Natalie Portman has played her role was completely stunning. I usually don't write reviews, and even less if I just finished watching it; but with this film I felt the need to do it.It's interesting to see the whole transformation that Nina (Natalie Portman) lives as the film goes on and the battle she has with herself at trying to be 'perfect' and find herself too. As the film progressed, I tried to figure out what was going to happen at the end (based on the story Nina was going to perform, 'Swan Lake') and yes, in fact it does end as the story tells, at least that's how I interpreted it. But at some point it got me thinking of Kafka's 'The Metamorphosis', which is what she -Nina- was experimenting, and just as the novella, it ends up with the main character being set up free.Natalie won that Oscar for her big work, such as acting and dancing ballet. The last thing I have to say is: you should definitely take a look to this worth-watching film. Reader, you have my word.",9,1,2,14 June 2016
