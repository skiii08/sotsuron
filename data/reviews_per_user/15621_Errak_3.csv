Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but will look even better with time.
","Like the 'original' Star Wars film, which we should probably be referring to as 'A New Hope' these days, The Phantom Menace is the first of a trilogy. Unlike Episode IV, however, Episode I does not work particularly well as a stand-alone movie. When George Lucas first made Star Wars, he was not at all sure that he could ever make The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. For the original release, the beginning 'scroll-off' letters did not say 'Episode IV.' This was later added after Star Wars became a success and the story could be told in its complete form.Now, 22 years later, we're getting the complete form. Lucas already knows, as we all do, that he'll have PLENTY enough money to film Episodes II and III, whether or not Episode I is a 'good' movie. So, we get a movie that is in essence a great big loose end-- it leads to the darker events of the rest of the prequel trilogy.The computer effects were marvelous, although I think more time could be spent on some of the technical animatronics (the Trade Federation viceroys, Yoda, and C-3PO). Maybe soon we will see an Episode I Special Edition where they put the Trade Federation leaders' lips in sync. Of course, since they had vaguely Japanese voices, Lucas might have been making fun of old dubbed Godzilla films. Similar references were made in the old trilogy, but those references are invisible to us, since Star Wars has all but replaced them with its own mythology.The acting was generally good, although it seemed a bit rushed or hasty. I do think the beginning of the film could have been much slower-paced. Jake Lloyd by no means deserves the nickname 'Mannequin' Skywalker. Liam Neeson was excellent, as was Ewan McGregor (who did quite well as the younger Obi-Wan). Casting was done well to find actors that resembled the old cast, since Anakin IS Luke's father and Amidala IS Leia's mother. They should look similar.All in all, I think this will look much better when the rest of the trilogy ties up this big loose end of a movie.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
Independence Day," Unbelievably Fun
","This is one of those movies I'm almost ashamed to say I like. But, for some reason, I love it. I'm not really sure why; most of the movie (especially the end) is incredibly hard to believe, but still fun.Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin always talk about how 'a movie doesn't mean anything if you don't care about what happens to the characters.' Well, by their definition, I think their movie does mean something, but it could mean a lot more. The characters are likeable and fun, but very poorly written. You mean to tell me that the President of the United States will still have a smile on his face after most of his country has been wiped out ? I don't think so. So I guess I care about the characters. But wouldn't it be nice if the characters cared about what was happening in the movie?",Null,0,2,31 August 1998
Saving Private Ryan," Best WWII movie thus far
","I've heard many people say that Vietnam was the most horrific and vicious war of this century. I always said, yes, it was bad, but no worse than any other war. I think that this film proves my point better than any book or essay.I've always been fascinated by World War II, and have enjoyed many of Steven Spielberg's WWII-era films as a result. After seeing this one, I see every other WWII movie before it as almost an insult to the reality of war. But I don't think a true account of what it was like on Normandy beach would be possible before now.Unlike other war movies, this one shows a larger picture, as seen from the perspective of individual soldiers. The characters in Saving Private Ryan are certainly the emphasis of the story, but Spielberg does not shy away from showing us the countless others they meet along the way. ALL of the characters in the movie are believable, not exaggerated as in many other war movies.Anyone who 'enjoys' the battle scenes is so completely desensitized to violence that even this movie won't be able to resensitize you. Anyone who says the movie's story is weak or that Spielberg's direction is a problem has either not seen the movie at all or made their minds up before they saw it. To fully appreciate Saving Private Ryan, one must put themselves in the soldiers' shoes, which in this case is made excruciatingly easy.This film's only weak point is far stronger than most American WWII movies. The German's perspective is represented here, but could still be better stated. I suggest Das Boot as a movie which shows what the enemy really thought about the war.",Null,0,0,14 August 1998
