The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Beautiful drama behind its classic teen-movie looks
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower made the top list of my personal favorites for 2013. Even though the movie was preceded by rather favorable criticism, I didn't expect to be taken away as I was. I must say that while reading the synopsis, this is typically the kind of movies that you have the impression of having already seen dozens of times. Except that for once, it stands wonderfully unique. And this is mainly because the nostalgia of the transition to adulthood was beautifully transcribed on the screen. Everyone can easily relate to the main character, Charlie, whether today's teenagers living precisely these experiences or those of yesterday who wistfully remember these golden years. The movie was not exempt from flaws. Starting with the clichés that were still relatively high. However, unlike other movies of the same genre, these clichés did not really matter because of the high affecting realism of the story and the characters.In my opinion, the story draws its strength from the characters. First we have Charlie who turns out to be much more complex than he looks like at the beginning, especially with his morbid emotional wounds. The character was beautifully played by Logan Lerman. His acting really moved me and he makes it hard to imagine someone else playing the role. This is by far his best performance.Sam and Patrick then were the first to truly accept Charlie in their group. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller were perfect. After a small role in My Week With Marilyn, Emma Watson, without her English accent, succeeded to deliver an outstanding performance in her first major role after Harry Potter's lovely Hermione. Ezra Miller keeps setting the bar higher for himself in every one of his movies. This was obviously his best performance so far. He brought life to the picture. The chemistry between actors was clearly there and Stephen Chbosky did an amazing job in his first time directing a movie, adapting his own book.Finally, I would like to say a word about the soundtrack. It enhanced the 80's and 90's atmosphere in the movie and added a profound emotional background to it.Ultimately, The Perks of Being A Wallflower is a beautiful drama carried by a great trio of actors. Behind its classic teen-movie looks, the movie evokes emotions and intelligence with nostalgia. A real must-see!",10,3,6,17 March 2013
Les Misérables," Biggest disappointment of 2013 so far
","Les Misérables of Tom Hooper was a big disappointment. Adapting one of the greatest books of the French literature is risky and hard enough but Tom Hooper decided to complicate things more by adapting the stage musical.The casting was one of the worst I have ever seen. The musical gathered a big number of great actors but for a musical you need mostly great voices. It is clear that most of the cast do not have singing experience or training. The writers went for a full musical where even small dialogues were sang. At some point, this became irritating because of the poor singing qualities. Except for Samantha Barks (as Eponine) and Colm Wilkinson (as the bishop), I didn't hear anything worth writing about.Voices aside, the cast was far from being perfect. Hugh Jackman was simply not the right actor to play Jean Valjean. His acting lacked anger and power which I find highly surprising given the number of angry characters he played in previous movies.I couldn't see Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. She's a good actress but too cold for the role. She couldn't show the vulnerable side of the character.Russel Crowe and Eddie Redmayne were simply badly miscast. Both have very limited voices and their performance was just not up to expectations.The only bright side of this movie was the performance of Anne Hathaway and the young Daniel Huttlestone. Anne was amazingly good and breathtaking at some scenes. If you are a fan of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables, I won't recommend this movie for you.",4,3,8,17 March 2013
