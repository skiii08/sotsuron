United 93," More than an average 'Movie'
","This film portrays the deplorable events that occurred on 9/11, 'United 93' was one of the four planes hijacked that day and was the only plane that did not reach its target. This is definitely not for the faint- hearted as it is a very moving portrayal. The film is in honour to the 40 passengers and crew who stood out their bravery in opposition to the four suicide terrorists who hijacked the plane but did not reach their intentions of a premeditated attack. Paul Greengrass wrote and directed the film, which he knew would be considered as very controversial. Many argued that it was too soon to be re-enacted, but Paul felt it seemed the right time to be made with a release 5 years after the event. Paul managed to get in contact with all the families on board of United 93 which wasn't an easy task. The families were all thoroughly supportive towards a film being made as long as it looked and felt realistic to what did supposedly occur. I was very impressed how this film created a believable truth, and the film certainly didn't suffer with its improvisation. United 93 unquestionably looks authentic and doesn't belong into a clichéd movie world where you anticipate extraordinary things to happen. There is a lot of visual effects used in this production and they are very well handled and aren't the centre of awareness. For instance, during the filming the plane was on the ground and not in the air but this was not apparent. I also really thought the music felt appropriate as it had a sense of misfortune and told the story of a broken nation, which was important because the film explored one of the most significant events in a lifetime.The cast assembles reasonably unknown actors that were a close representation to those on board on the day. The actors were given studies to each individual's life and they met the families to give them a broad insight to whom they were playing. I have to say the acting in this film is very close to perfection and it felt truthful to use unknown actors who were just like any average Joe stuck in an everyday life. I felt this was a really good idea because I often get distracted when I see certain actors and it reminds me that the film is fictional. I believe what also made it appear authentic were the scenes shot in the air traffic command centre. The people portraying these roles are factual people and not actors, most of who were there on the day of 9/11  portraying themselves. The pilots and stewardess on board of the plane are also non professional actors and depicting what they do in everyday life.After watching this film I felt extremely speechless and proud of the passengers and crew that were on board - they took the chance of sacrificing their life. The film didn't make them look like victims, if anything they are the heroes! It is such a credible film and I cant think of anything negative to say about it. I felt very emotional after watching this and I envisage numerous others will too.",9,3,5,31 March 2009
Glory," Glory is no irony.
","Glory is the historical true story based on the first ever all-African American regiment who fought for the North American Civil War. The cast is assembled with Matthew Broderick, Gary Elwes, Morgan Freeman and an Oscar Winning Performance for Best Supporting Actor - Denzel Washington.Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Broderick) and Maj. Cabot Forbes (Elwes) guide the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts. They are both young and enthusiastic Bostonians. Sgt. Major. John Rawlins (Freeman) unites the troops; and Pvt. Trip (Washington) is the runaway rebellious slave who embodies the strength of the regiment. The black regiment gamble sacrifice so they can gain respect and freedom and attempt to fight for equality.I consider this as a very favourable war film as there are constant heart stopping and evocative moments which make it appealing from start to finish. The film is focused on dignity, battles, emotional growth, brotherhood, solidarity, race, determination, equality and most importantly sacrifice. There is also a lot of optimism in the film and I witnessed the regiment unite together and stand as one despite all their differences. These are all common elements in war films but I feel 'Glory' made a bigger impact on me than many of its contemporaries.The 54thth Massachusetts regiment are treated unfairly compared to any ordinary regiment. They struggle to gain respect and are ordered to do the impossible during training. This gets them prepared and stronger than any other ordinary regiment. I am impressed how touching this portrayal is and my sympathy towards the characters was very strong. None of the primary characters featured in the 54th are real, with the exception of Shaw (Broderick). The fictional characters still seemed to be very realistic and I can imagine many characters were similar in the regiment. Prior to watching 'Glory' I wasn't fully aware of the story and how much of an impact it has on American history. The history created in this film feels very realistic and I consider myself very fortunate compared to the suffering these men had to go through. I feel director Edward Zwick's intentions were to make the film entertaining as well as educational, and he certainly succeeded with this. The dialogue also feels very pragmatic and I'm sure many people will be able to relate to it, especially those who have military experience. My one complaint with 'Glory' is the fighting scenes. I didn't feel it expressively engaged me as much as the dialogue did. The choreography could have been a lot better and it stood out as quite weak to me compared to the story. However, 'Glory' was released in 1989 and I did feel the cinematography is quite impressive in relation to blockbusters released in recent years, so I do give a lot of credibility for that. To conclude with this review I feel this is an important film to watch and I wasn't disappointed with it at all. It is a true story that has a real meaning. Edward Zwick concentrates on emotions in his films and the actors really managed to captivate this in the production. The film isn't too graphic like most war films which is a refreshing change and one of the main reasons I enjoyed this. I hope you will too.",Null,1,2,14 April 2009
Speed," Super Speed!
","Speed is a suspenseful thriller that features Officer Jack Traven, an L.A.P.D specialist (Keanu Reeves) and Detective Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) who both battle against a rather bitter villain ex cop, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) Payne (Hopper) produces a revenge attack by planting a bomb on a bus that has the potential to kill thousands of innocent people. It's up to Officer Jack Traven (Reeves) to prevent the bus from exploding. He does this amazingly by boarding the bus and keeping the speed above 50mph. He also has to deal with terrified passengers which he finds isn't an easy job at all. Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is a passenger on board of the bus and she takes control as the driver. She controls the bus with an obvious wisdom of horror but also with a strong sentiment of authority. Reeves character puts his trust into Annie immediately and they are both able to support each other in many life or death situations that occur. Jack Traven (Reeves) and Annie (Bullock) form a comforting bond which really helps them both whilst they are in the middle of a crisis. Payne(Hopper) is simply greedy for money and wants Traven (Reeves) to provide the money for him - before he starts taking away people's lives, and he will do so with no hesitation. There is not a second of wasted screen time which just makes it a spectacular film to watch. The film is very enjoyable and includes intense situations that are simply breathtaking. 'Speed' has been correlated to 'Die Hard' because it features vulnerable hostages that are surviving from a heroic figure. What I enjoyed about this film is that it had a mixture of suspense and humour featuring fast moving shots and a killer sense of hilarity with various unexpected plot twists!However, there were parts of the film appeared to be a little unrealistic and it seemed that more research ought to have taken into position before shooting, or shouldn't have been included in the final edit at all.. I found myself questioning the logic during certain scenes considering it is classified as a realist film. The acting isn't exactly perfection at times either; with a lot of lines being delivered gave me a cringe worth reaction.Payne (Hopper) portrays a very realist villain and I was impressed with his performance. His malevolency antics are quite simply worrying as he appears to be invincible, even though he's just sitting at his residence relaxing with his feet up. Harry Temple (Daniels) attempts to go after Payne (Hopper). Its a challenge to find out Payne's identity but he manages to do so, which is risky business and and finds out how dangerous Payne (Hopper) really is.Jan de Bont directed 'Speed' as his debut whilst previously switching from cinematography on other films, including 'Die Hard'. I was very impressed with his efforts taking into consideration that it was the first time in full charge. The film was written by Graham Yost, who could also be considered as a fresher, as 'Speed' was the first film he wrote, prior to writing TV shows. To finish up, I did enjoy this film and I imagine many others will too. Don't have any doubt about watching this. Its not a must see film, but its enjoyable to say the least. So, if you ever have 111 minutes to spare in your life then the best thing to do is resort to 'Speed'. The film, not the drug.",8,1,2,13 March 2009
