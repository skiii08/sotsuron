Lucky Number Slevin," Slevin not so lucky
","While Morgan Freeman (The Boss) and Bruce Willis (Goodkat) are super-entertaining, the movie itself is less than intriguing. There are too many twists and not enough delivery. In the middle of this flick I recall thinking 'oh, wow, what's going on!' and when I discovered the plot I thought 'oh...ok...'. A lot of hook and no reel-in. Every time someone got shot (and this happens rather excessively) I threw my hands in the air and felt exasperated. The actors really deliver and play their roles very well (Lucy Liu was fantastic, might I add), but the movie is a complete let-down. The ending does give the watcher a sense of closure, but is a complete flop because it fails to give that 'one-two punch' you might have expected half-way through. It doesn't give nearly as much emotion as it does in the beginning, and thats the problem.",5,6,19,10 April 2006
Inside Man," Inside Man
","Great job by Washington, as usual, and an overall average film. Not nearly as huge of a let-down as Lucky Number Slevin, but Inside Man was not all that intriguing itself. It has huge build-ups and some really suspenseful moments, but the ending leaves you feeling a little cheated.By all means, see the movie and judge for yourself - It just didn't deliver what I expected from it. I am most definitely not bashing the plot; you will be on the edge of your seat until the ending begins to be revealed. At that point you may feel like shrugging your shoulders and muttering 'eh...'. Washington does a great job of portraying his role, but you may feel a little resentful of his character's extremely bold/holier-than-thou attitude halfway through.",6,3,3,10 April 2006
