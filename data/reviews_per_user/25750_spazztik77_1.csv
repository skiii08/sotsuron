The Ring," Terrible....
","!!Spoilers!! I'm sorry, but this might have been the stupidest movie I've ever seen. It was incredibly cheesy, corny, and had a ridiculous ending. Filmmakers need to draw the line between gross and scary. There were some things in the movie that looked simply disgusting. The Birds - Now that was a scary movie. That had these psychotic birds that flew around eating people and pecking out their eyes. Not this stupid 'girl coming out of a TV to kill you' type of thing. This movie was not hard to follow, or hard to understand, it was just hard for me to freaking stay awake. ooh, a horse is going nuts! ahh! scary! This girl is mentally disturbed and was wierdo-freak parents! ahh! She has long hair over her face and looks like a freak! ahh! I would have gotten more enjoyment out of banging my head on a wall for the 2 hours this movie dragged on. The coolest part was when the horse want nuts and got all chopped up. That was hilarious. And the video itself was rather interesting. Either way, I want my $4.50 and 2 hours of my life back. Terrible. I would have given it a negative score if I could. If you haven't seen this movie, don't.",1,1,4,8 February 2003
