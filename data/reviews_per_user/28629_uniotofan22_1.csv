The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," this movies was really good and I'm a guy saying this..surprising right?
","OK first off i went to see this with my girlfriend and 4 of my friends which 3 of my friends was a guy and 1 was a girl and then there was my girlfriend, but anyways on with the movie OK surprisingly i though well maybe this wont be good since all the reviews are saying that but actually it was an excellent movie i loved it,OK but its not like twilight-which was cheesy,romantically corny and kinda interesting but tireding,or new moon-which was full of action,laughs but still the romance level was still in away a bit corny but not as bad,then we have eclipse-which is kinda funny,interesting intensely action-packed,full of shocking momentsNow ill review breaking dawn part 1,OK first of all the wedding was funny,romantic and interesting,then after the wedding we go into the honeymoon and that was flat out awkward/funny,but also as I've heard some people use sexy,now i wouldn't use that because well I'm 16 and it was awkwardly funny for me especially when the bed broke haha,but my opinion would be that how did this film not get an R rating with all the sex/nudity and disturbing images in it,OK it says partial nudity but that's wrong OK because when they were in the lake you could see parts of nudity for instance the side view of Kristen Stewart,but anyways OK so the honeymoon starts int he water then goes to the Bed,and then goes to all these random kissing/making out/sexual scenes i swear there whole honeymoon Bella wanted based off sex! LOL,she kept basically begging for more but Edward didn't want to keep hurting her since he left bruises all over her body,which was kinda disturbing,but lets go after the honeymoon-or during OK so Bella asks Edward how long its been since the wedding he says 14 days and says why? she says I've missed my period? so yeah she find out shes pregnant then we go and findout shes sick/being basically eaten from the inside out because she looks really old but then Jacob comes up with a joking solution that actually works he says it wants something to sink its teeth into aka blood SO its pretty disturbing watching Bella drink cups full of blood and what makes it worse she says yum! and actaulyl gets into drinking it she doesn't think ti tastes bad so of course i yelled you bloodsucker because you can tell she wants to be a vampire because shes a human and she enjoys drinking blood,OK but anyways then we go into all the wolf- conflict,Jacob,Leah,Seth and going against there pack and blah blah blah,the reason is aid blah blah isn't because I'm bored its because there's a lot of those parts i cant spoil but i will-say an interesting/weird/funny scene that ruined the film a little but is till liked was when Jacob in wolf form was talking with his pack and arguing and they sounded like Robots loll and they growled while talking it was hard to take it seriously what i loved most about this movie is its a drama/romance and a fantasy and horror,there were some disturbing,creepy,intense and emotional scenes the wolf pack and the culelnt fight was intense/bizarre,it made me feel sorry for the Cullen's because of a huge msiunderstanding,the birth and Bella's transformation was very intense/disturbing and creepy,beautiful and mysterious but the blood level and intensity in that scene was i bet at least somewhat of an r-rating because I've never seen anything like that in a pg13 then again I've never seen so many prolonged sex scenes in a pg13 either so yeah,jacobs imprinting on renesme was beyond cool,fantasy like and romantic to an extent,it was so cool same with Bella's transformation because it showed images from all 4 movies so that was cool,oh by the way if you go to watch this stay after the credits because there's a scene with the volturi that gets you pumped up/but makes you feel the intensity coming our way for Breaking Dawn part 2,this ones more mature,dark,and creepy/disturbing then all 3 combined but creepy/disturbing wasn't in the previous 3 until this one so yeah and there was more blood then the previous 3 combined also i loved how it showed Edwards story toward the beginning it shows us a kinda dark/creepy side to Edward that we've never known before and Bella's dream sequence was horrific/creepy/disturbing/shocking and bizarrely weird but interesting OVERAll i give it 10/10 and there were plenty of great scenes I ill admit though some parts do tend to drag on a bit/slow down the pace of the film but the last 30minutes was non stop intensity/action/disturbing bloody images especially the last 10minutes",Null,3,9,20 November 2011
