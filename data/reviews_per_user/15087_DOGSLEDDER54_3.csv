The Sound of Music," perfect movie
","I first saw this movie in 1965, fifty short years ago. I liked it, but what with me being a twelve year old male, it did not rate very highly with me among the Jame Bond features, action films, and numerous World War Two films being shown at the time. It DID resonate with me at least a little bit due to my knowledge of and hatred for all things related to Nazi Germany. My father, and the fathers of all my friends had fought in World War II, and when my friends and I wanted to play Army, we had to play Civil War, as no one wanted to be either the Germans or the Japanese. Compared to them, the Union army, and the Confederate army were lovable or at least not hated by my friends and I.I recently was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music again on the Big Screen. I again liked it, no- this time LOVED IT. As a huge fan of films, I have a very large collection of films on DVD, and I regularly attend my local theaters. Of ALL the films I have ever seen, IN MY OPINION, this is the only film I have ever seen which I deem to be both TECHNICALLY PERFECT and ARTISTICALLY PERFECT. I would have said only that one line, but reviews are required to be ten lines long. ;-]",10,2,8,21 April 2015
Donnie Brasco," One look can be deadly !
","There are already 282 reviews for the film Donnie Brasco. So what is there that is new that I can tell you about it ? Well, I agree that is is a great, entertaining film about the Mafia. I agree that there is much that is very different than most run of the mill gangster films, such as feeding hamburgers to a zoo animal in the back seat of a Cadillac. VERY amusing. And supposedly TRUE. I agree that the actors Pacino, Depp, Madsen, and the rest of the cast turned in excellent performances. So what can I add to that ? I would like to commend the work of Robert Miano who portrays Sonny Red in the film. One look from him would terrify me as it did those under his thumb. One look from him meant terror, danger, and a deadly threat to the recipient. No word was needed- just look at those daggers coming out of his eyes. Deadly and chilling to the point of Absolute Zero !",8,0,0,6 July 2020
Midway," Good but not as Good as the original
","Good overall retelling of the battle of Midway, with a few reservations. Woody Harrelson doesn't seem forceful enough as Chester Nimitz, and the character of Dick Best is hampered by either a speech impediment or is speaking some strange dialect. The movie includes all of the details in the background story and events leading up to the battle, and includes some great action scenes, but fails to have the zing of the original. Overall a good effort but the story is seen through a slightly duller lens and leaves me wondering why the original needed to be remade.",6,1,3,10 November 2019
