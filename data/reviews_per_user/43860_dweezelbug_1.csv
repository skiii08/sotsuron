The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Exceeded My Expectations
","As an avid fan of the Hunger Games books and the first two movies. I must admit I was a little worried that the Mockingjay Movies wouldn't be a good because of the lack of action. Boy was I wrong. Yes there isn't nearly as much in fight scenes but who needs it. Mockingjay was far better than the Hunger Games & Catching Fire. Jennifer Lawrence is an acting genius she makes you feel the emotions with her, and I love the signing scene the song is so catching and she has such a bluesy voice.They still lighten the mood a little bit with plenty of funny one liners that make you laugh.",10,17,50,19 November 2014
