Angels & Demons," Good movie but not nearly as good as the book
","The film is highly entertaining and fast paced, I saw it at 11pm and it didn't make me sleepy at all (which is truly amazing). I, unfortunately, read the novel before the movie came out, so it is sort of disappointing to me, the movie is no where near as good as the book.Probably due to the time restraint, they had to take out quite a few action packed scenes, not that I would've complained if it was 4 hrs. I also did not like the movie's portrayal of the chamberlain, he is a much deeper character in the book. The actor they chose, Ewan McGregor, is a perfect fit for the role though, it's the script writer's fault :pAs far as Robert Langdon goes...well, suffice to say that I didn't pay too much attention to him. I think this movie is definitely one of those where the secondary character steals the scene.",9,2,5,18 May 2009
