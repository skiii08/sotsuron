Changeling," Does Hope Spring Eternal?
","It's been said that hope springs eternal. Yet for many of us, it is an illusion. In vain, we dream for good health, for financial independence, for true love. Seeking escape or inspiration, we turn to movies.Changeling, the account of a mother searching for her missing nine year old son, presents a paradox. Based upon true events, its outcome is predetermined. So on one hand, unlike an artificial happy ending of a work of fiction, we could be offered an authentic portrayal of hope validated upon reuniting with her boy. On the other hand, we might be faced with the mother finding him dead, or not even knowing his fate. How can she rationally cope? The challenge for the director lies in staging this drama.Overall, the acting is fine, the cinematography excellent. Notwithstanding the R rating, horrid images are depicted with minimal visual gore which in your mind's eye actually exacerbates the horror. The corrupt cops and the monstrous psych ward staff are overtly hostile to the mother. The pastor initially appears supportive when she aids his political cause against the establishment. But after her service, he tells her it is time to abandon hope for her child. Nevertheless, she valiantly clings on, as do we in empathy.Tragically, the director, seeming to underscore the pastor, himself forsakes the mother. This otherwise powerful movie is emasculated by its finale. Changeling merely delivers its denouement with a text overlay explaining what happened. Reread that sentence. Let it sink in, and you'll share the emotional vacuum thrust upon the viewer. Whatever escape or inspiration one sought instantly crashes.I later learned that historical records reveal little about the woman and her son after the calamity. But this is no excuse for leaving us empty. In the film Hollywoodland, despite sketchy facts, the death of George Reeves (the 1950's TV Superman) was rigorously interpreted and portrayed three alternative ways. Because the narrative begins in 1928, the mother is presumably now deceased. Thoughts and feelings she took to her grave remain undramatized. Hope springs eternal only in theology: in the world of Changeling, hope dies a lonely death.",Null,8,13,25 October 2008
Star Trek," Tears Of Remembrance, Tears Of Sorrow
","Reviewing a remake is always tricky because the new feature can never stand alone, rather it is invariably compared to the original. The new Star Trek movie tries to avoid this dilemma by utilizing the old time warp theme. History is rewritten including the details of how Captain Kirk joined his crew.The problem isn't so much the story, rather it's the new actors playing the old roles. Don't get me wrong, they all tried hard. Some, especially the new Spock, Doc Bones, and Scotty were downright good imitations, but they were still fakes. Poor Spock, I mean the poor actor, at the denouement he meets up with his future self, played by Leonard Nimoy, the one and only Spock, and is put to embarrassing shame by comparison.In the TV saga, the Next Generation was the start of new actors portraying new characters carrying on the tradition. Instead of a remake, why couldn't this movie have been like that?Sure, there were moments in the film when tears formed in my eyes as I recalled the glory days of the original series. But the tears of remembrance merged with tears of sorrow because you can't go home again. Even DVDs of old episodes don't quite bring back the joy of experiencing them for the first time. But contemplating those remarkable old episodes is more satisfying than watching people here play dress up.",5,39,66,9 May 2009
Brokeback Mountain," Loneliness, the Bible, and Brokeback Mountain
","It's Christmas Eve as I write this article. We're all aware that in our culture, this holiday is not about Christ but rather commercialism and family. For those of us living alone with limited means the season can be torturous. But since money does not buy happiness, and many relationships have difficulties, even rich couples can feel empty. Jesus Himself was neither wealthy nor a family man. He associated with persons who were social outcasts. He loved His male disciple. Then He died painfully, abandoned by most of His friends. His experience offers solace to some, but others seek something more tangible.Many people escape their loneliness through movies with a 'Hollywood' ending. But consider It's A Wonderful Life. Were it not for his impossibly wonderful wife, would Jimmy Stewart's character have found the will to live? And are those of us without such a partner really made happy by this couple's happy ending? Frankly, as a single person, I'd more identify with a movie whose lead character handles loneliness, showing us how it can be done.Such a movie is Brokeback Mountain. But before I can say more, we must deal with the word on the street that Brokeback is about gay cowboys lusting after each other, ruining their respective marriages in the process. Rather than condemning this homophobic view, let us recognize that many men properly fear dating the same gender precisely because sex would get in the way of genuine friendship as is too often the case between men and women.As Apostle Paul flat out says, it is best to be single and celibate, but if one cannot control one's lust, then one should marry. While it can be debated whether the Bible explicitly condemns homosexuality (the interpretation depends on which translation one uses), marital sex is clearly not held in high esteem and is necessary only for procreation. Brokeback acknowledges this by displaying equally unpleasant sexual scenes with both same and opposite genders, but honors having children. Unlike so many 'romantic' movies of today that pretend 'making love' is heartfelt love, Brokeback plays it straight, pun intended.I won't disclose the ending but the movie hints at its denouement from the opening scene with the lead character Ennis waiting for someone. Because of all the hype surrounding the alleged gay theme, I initially wondered if he was hoping for a pickup. But of course not! He's actually anticipating an employment interview. I realized that I needed to put out of my head preconceptions and grasp what I was seeing. I then understood that this movie is the story of Ennis through his own eyes. His physical involvement with a man occupies only a small portion of the screen time. Mostly Ennis copes with what he has sown, struggling to achieve salvation.Brokeback Mountain rephrases the question 'is it better to have never loved than loved and lost?' to 'is it better to have never loved than lost the chance to love?'. The paradox is that one can only answer either question by experiencing the consequences. Without a lover at hand, one can exist on fantasies of an entirely imaginary lover, or on fantasies of what love was or might have been like with a specific real person.Watch Brokeback Mountain not for what the hype says, but for what it says in context. Though the word 'says' is misleading. The dialog in the film is sparse as most of the context is expressed through facial expressions and body language. This is acting at its finest. Open your eyes and you shall see. Most importantly, in your lonely evenings, think about this movie until the DVD comes out, when you can then virtually visit this heaven on earth.",10,30,35,24 December 2005
The Polar Express," A Journey Of Faith
","Several years ago on Christmas Eve, I was feeling sorry for myself being single and lonely. After attending church, I waited for a bus home in the cold snowy gloom, fearful about the safety of a past midnight commute. Suddenly a brightly lit bus pulled over with no person present but the driver. Opening the door, he cheerfully bellowed out Merry Christmas and asked me to jump on board. The musical theme from The Twilight Zone played in my head as I entered the warm light.My driver talked about himself being single and lonely, and how he had been saved by Jesus. His married co-workers did not want a Christmas route, so he gladly accepted this run as a way to share the holiday spirit by buoying mine. Although deeply engaged in expressing his thoughts, he drove expertly with care. I remained the one and only passenger. We approached my stop across the street where I live. Not yet finished with his testimony, he parked the vehicle for several minutes. Shaking hands, I alighted. The driver waved as he pulled the bus away. I stared at it fading into the dark distance.That night was my ride on The Polar Express.Thanks to the new movie with the same name, I've been able to relive my journey of faith through the eyes of other witnesses. Presented in a choice of 3D or 2D or Digital, enthralling animation virtually places you on the set, the film opening with an older man narrating his experience as a youngster on Christmas Eve in 1955. His name is never given as he represents any one of us viewers. He lies awake afraid he won't hear the sound he awaits: the sleigh bells belonging to Santa Claus. He's of that age when he's beginning to realize that Santa might just be an illusion, and he desperately needs proof of something out there beyond ordinary existence, something wonderful and inspiring. The Polar Express then arrives, the conductor announcing it will transport him to the North Pole. It struck me that it would take a humongous leap of faith for a child to board this very strange train.There's a tendency to blame modern science for the abrogation of faith. The beautiful sunrise you admire and give thanks for is said to be nothing more than gases and photons resulting from a random Big Bang. Yet questioning faith is ancient and is illustrated in the Bible itself. The story of doubting Thomas tells us he believed in the resurrection of Jesus only upon touching the mark of the nails in His hands. Paradoxically, we are asked to accept this account as Gospel when we ourselves have no hands to examine.As the train begins leaving, the lad climbs aboard. Clearly his own decision, he realizes under the surreal circumstances normal rules of logic don't apply. He joins other interesting characters, including a know-it-all kid, a sweet girl, and a protective hobo whose personality is a bit like my bus driver. Most haunting is the lonely boy from the wrong side of the tracks who you sense has been physically abused.The passengers endure trial and tribulation helping each other grow in understanding themselves and getting to their destination. The scene of the lost ticket flying through the air is profound. How that ticket winds up back on the train mirrors the miracles of real life. Skeptics can explain away the phenomenon, but like the sunrise, is it simply an accident, or is an unseen hand at work? The vast Ice Lake resembles a frozen Sea of Galilee and as in the Biblical reckoning, the faith of those on board gets them to the other side without drowning. Only our youngster remains unsure. It's all a dream, isn't it? His struggles to believe will tear at your soul.When the train finally reaches the North Pole, I grew anxious about Santa's forthcoming appearance. How could he possibly meet expectations? By comparison, Ben-Hur is the sole movie about Jesus I appreciate because His face is never shown. I think it's too difficult for human actors to portray a person who is also divine or otherwise supernatural. But the superb animation process of The Polar Express enhances actors' features, rendering the encounter of the boy with Santa so provocatively authentic that Santa has to remind us he's only a symbol of Christmas, the real Spirit being in the heart.Our hero returns home, the train departing without a trace. Was his adventure real or a dream? Viewers differ on the interpretation of the clues offered. Cynics argue it doesn't matter for either way the whole thing is a fairy tale. Well, reconsider the paradox of doubting Thomas. At the end of the day, even he was alone holding only memories of the hands he touched. Had he merely imagined the event? As with the train ticket or my bus driver, you hang onto the mystery of what happened, believing when others doubt. You may even believe the story of Thomas.I recall the words of the eminent author Ayn Rand, 'When people look back at their childhood or youth, their wistfulness comes from the memory, not of what their lives had been in those years, but of what life had then promised to be. The expectation of some undefinable splendor, of the unusual, the exciting, the great, is an attribute of youth - and the process of aging is the process of that expectation's gradual extinction.'Do yourself a favor. Step aboard The Polar Express. You'll travel back when you were young and innocent, revisiting the hopes and dreams you have since abandoned. The intensity of your restored faith may prove overwhelming and you may weep as other grownups in theaters have. The movie posters truthfully advertise, 'This holiday season... believe'.",10,23,30,17 November 2004
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Two Little Boys Holding Hands Symbolize Salvation
","Perhaps a friend or boss or significant other tells you a lie, betrays your confidence, physically abuses you. To escape from your disillusionment with humanity, you wish to see an inspirational movie. How about an adventure where there's a hero determined to avenge the exploited like yourself?This is the subject matter of The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. In Nazi occupied Europe, eight year old Bruno, son of a death camp commander, meets a boy, Shmuel, and becomes his friend. Bruno discovers he's Jewish and betrays him. Overwhelmed by guilt, Bruno attempts to help his friend but winds up with him in a gas chamber, the two little boys holding hands as they die.Whew! The incredulity disturbs many, for despite millennia of recorded human indignity, there is something incomprehensibly evil about the Holocaust. In contrast, there is something incomprehensibly good about this film. I watched the DVD during Christmas, the holiday commemorating the birthday of a Jew who died trying to save the world for Gentiles. Inversely Christlike, Bruno is a Gentile who dies trying to save the world for Jews.Critics complain that Bruno's story is pure fiction. Nevertheless, real life heroes do exist. Miep Gies tried to save Anne Frank. Miep and Anne live on in our consciousness. Though their sacrifice hasn't significantly improved the world, neither did Christ's sacrifice.Perhaps, then, your disillusionment with humanity will be alleviated as you envision two little boys holding hands symbolize salvation.",10,3,5,26 December 2010
The Da Vinci Code," The Da Vinci Code Paradox
","Ever since childhood I have been fascinated by two historical paradoxes. The first was the American Revolution which simultaneously established the land of freedom and the land of slavery. The second was Christianity which simultaneously embraced Jewish Jesus Christ and anti-Semitism.The Da Vinci Code movie expands on the latter paradox by postulating that Jesus was married to Jewish Mary Magdalene and fathered a daughter, whose descendants may possess certain of His powers. Protagonists contend the church has ruthlessly suppressed these people and their supporters because they would undermine masculine authority by exalting women to a divine level. At one point in the film, certain people in hiding claiming to be these descendants reminded me of Holocaust survivors.The Magdalene theory is not new. Most scholars reject it based on historical reasons and Christians reject it based on faith that Christ was single and celibate as Apostle Paul later declared a man of God should be. But The Da Vinci Code does not fail as a good movie despite rejecting its specific theory:One) Much time is spent exploring the concept of paradox and the film demonstrates how several people looking at the same object see different things. Da Vinci's painting depicting the Last Supper is beautifully examined in this manner with the latest computer special effects.Two) We are presented with a fair account of the historical controversies concerning the humanity and divinity of Jesus. As a Bible student, I am impressed by how effectively this description is offered to mass audiences who may not be well versed in such matters.Three) Pictures tell a thousand words. Drama takes precedence over the intellectual presentation and holds your attention. We witness fervor from the antagonists, partake in a breath taking thriller, experience surprises galore, and are moved by the psychological development of the parties.I won't disclose the ending but I can hint that it returns to the subject I raised at the beginning. I once read an explanation that Polish Catholic anti-Semitism resulted from being envious of the Jews' physical relation to Jesus even if not His literal descendants. Envy, because Jews experience a family closeness to Christ that Gentiles never achieve.You see, the real paradox of The Da Vinci Code is that whether the theory about Mary Magdalene is true or not, the conclusion remains the same. Relatives of Jesus Christ do in fact exist. How about them apples?",10,4,10,19 May 2006
Life," Jake 'n' Ryan 'n' Calvin: The Moral of Life
","Coincidentally, my buddy and I recently revisited two DVDs, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN with Jake Gyllenhaal and WOMAN IN GOLD with Ryan Reynolds, so discovering that both gentlemen star together as space station astronauts in the movie LIFE, we checked it out.Soil is taken from an unmanned vessel returning from Mars, An organism is found. Our world is informed of the discovery and a little girl gives it the name of Calvin from her Calvin Coolidge school. (President Coolidge advocated noninterference in foreign affairs, maybe a noble idea, but contributing to the development of World War II.)It quickly becomes apparent that Calvin is not benign and begins graphically killing the crew to consume their blood. The being grows larger and more powerful seemingly invulnerable to destruction. I have seen my share of horror movies but this one had me scared as it felt too realistic plus you were connected to the plight of the characters.Of course, in reality, nothing is more terrifying than people conducting mayhem. In the earlier mentioned films, Jake suffered from homophobia, and Ryan suffered from consequences of the Holocaust. In LIFE, however, we are led to believe that governments have achieved relative peace in their search for extra terrestrial life. Perhaps peace is even harder to fathom than the existence of the life form.I had read reviews mentioning a twist ending without disclosing any details. So I reflected on possible outcomes. Does Clavin kill all on board, does it invade earth? And what is the mechanism of these events? You also may be drawn into the story especially anticipating the conclusion.I found the movie edifying. Just as peace can lead to dangerous consequences, so too can unbridled scientific research. This is, pun intended, the moral of LIFE.",Null,1,2,24 March 2017
The Ugly Truth," The Truth Is Truly Ugly
","I chose to view The Ugly Truth for two reasons.First, I had last seen the star, Katherine Heigl, in a remarkable 2002 Twilight Zone episode, Cradle of Darkness. She's from the future sent on a one way trip back in time to the year of Hitler's birth where she's to try killing the baby. She gives a riveting performance, ending with a shocking twist. I naturally wondered how she'd do in a comedy.Second, the title of her new movie intrigued me. The truth is seldom told precisely because it is ugly, hence unpopular. Many people prefer comforting lies from movies, politicians, and dates. It would be refreshing to have a film uphold a principle regardless of its consequences.Paradoxically, while discovering the movie rewarding on both counts, the truth was so ugly that I don't wish to see it again, and can better appreciate Katherine's fine acting skills in her earlier performance.Here's a succinct summary: The male lead portrays a sexist pig believing that men want only one thing, and women who romanticize for something more are losers. Katherine plays a modern woman with old fashioned virtues, finally meeting a nice guy. The sexist pig, confident she'll fail, offers to help her get a date with the guy. However, when she appears to be heading towards a relationship, the pig gets jealous, so he makes an R rated pass at her in an elevator. The result? She coldly dumps the nice guy because she found the sexist pig sexier. The movie concludes with an even stronger R rated scene of our heroine in bed with the pig.Disgusting, yes, but true to life, isn't it? Just look in your own mirror. If you're a nice guy, you've probably finished last. If you're a romantically inclined woman, you're probably pining away. And if you're a happy couple, well, please spare your lonely neighbors your X rated chatter, and watch out, 'cause the sexual excitement will diminish and you'll cheat on each other seeking fresh conquests!",Null,7,14,31 July 2009
Atonement," Atonement: All In The Mind
","Unrequited love: how torturous. Your feelings for another are never returned. At best, they simply ignore you. At worst, they mercilessly take advantage of you by accepting your gifts and attention, then brandishing their new partner(s). Slowly, your love painfully dies, and you only wish they would atone for their behavior.The movie Atonement grasps this process. But your impression of its subject matter differs if you've seen previews luring you into witnessing a couple's passionate affair ruined by a jealous lover. You may also have heard about the 'Hitchcockian' ending turning everything upside down.Precisely the point: the plot is all in the mind. And this critical element, hinted at the film's opening, is missed both by those walking in late, and by the seated ones prejudiced from the trailers. You see, it immediately becomes clear that the entire movie will be the product of the central character, Briony, who initially is 13 years old. A different actress plays her at age 18, then she's portrayed at 77 by the superb Vanessa Redgrave. Briony writes fiction and thus is acutely aware how reality and fantasy sometimes merge. One must watch events through her eyes to properly understand the motives and consequences of the sexual gratification between older sister Cecilia and the housekeeper's son, Robbie, for whom Briony has a crush.Though having called Briony his pal, Robbie bluntly uses her to deliver a letter to Cecilia. When C & R get around to doing it, it's in the house library, and they know full well that Briony could enter at any second as in fact occurs. C'mon, this liaison is pure lust in front of a minor, and at that moment, I absolved Briony for whatever she subsequently did, including erroneously testifying that Robbie later raped her cousin, also a minor. The atonement Briony endures for having Robbie convicted of the wrong crime is belied by the film concentrating half its length on Robbie suffering in World War II combat. Indeed, he is the one who needed to atone for his sin.Leaving for duty, Robbie has a brief meeting with Cecilia as she awaits a bus on a London street. Acknowledging his discomfort with their library encounter, he's uncertain what he felt with her or if a loving relationship could ever develop. During the war, when he becomes very ill, his soldier buddy tenderly strokes his forehead. Ironically, from this man, Robbie receives the heartfelt love totally absent from his making love with Cecilia.In several places we observe a scene performed twice with different interpretations. That's because of Briony's alternate takes. After all, don't you sometimes think you were crazy for loving someone who treated you as worthless, or imagine they rejected you as a lovesick fool and expected your atonement for wasting their time? Of course, all along they actually did whatever they pleased, and as they continue to prosper, you are left alone with your abject thoughts.The Bible tells us that God does not forgive the unrepentant. We're trying to be more than Divine if we attempt to do so. Instead, identify with a young girl, Briony, who spends the rest of her life creatively dealing with the callousness of others. Perhaps, all in your mind, you will find from those having hurt you, atonement in Atonement.Peace.",10,8,14,31 January 2008
