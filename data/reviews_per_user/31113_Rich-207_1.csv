The Blair Witch Project," Not Worth The Hype
","This movie did not come anywhere near to living up to all of its hype.  It's definitely not the scariest movie I've ever seen, and, unless you enjoy getting dizzy and hearing the f-word constantly, I would advise you to go see something else.",3,0,2,28 July 1999
