The Equalizer," Good acting and directing yet another hero story
","Good old story line where a good guy kills bad guys... A hero saves the girl and the day.... Thanks to Denzel Washington's acting skills (in general casting and acting is good) and the director's talent it turns out to be a good movie and not a complete waste of time.However, you'd love it, unless you are sick of a guy, who used to be a but now tries to have a laid back life style, yet trouble finds him and he kicks ass again...So, if you want to spent a Sunday watching a good action movie with no original story, it's a good choice. Yet, nothing more than mediocre in my book.",6,2,2,18 January 2015
The Hangover," give me a break!
","I can't believe this movie gets such high ratings. I just wasted 1.5 hours of my life. I decided to see it because everyone was so high about it... I had such high expectations as a result, of course. Oh man, there is nothing more in the whole movie than in the trailers. And to me the trailer was no fun, either... So you can tell if you are with me at this point.It started really slow and I was waiting for something to happen.. nope nothing... At some point I expected a twist. nope... The tiger, the baby, the tooth, the bed, everything is just so forced. It was like when Conan o'Brien creates absurd situations and take a shot of that moment in his show. Conan's creations are waaaay funny though... I have to apologize from Conan for comparing this movie to his absurd shots since he does them for what they are. But these guys in hangover is trying to sell a real funny story, but I don't buy it. not a bit, sorry.All those screams, cursing, unnecessary naked people and stupidness got me stressed! I didn't enjoy it, but go ahead and watch. I may be the only person who is telling you that it's not good. just... whatever...",1,130,243,2 July 2009
