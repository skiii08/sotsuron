Walk the Line," Walk the Line
","Despite the fact that the movie 'Walk the Line' was firstly shown in 2005, I watched it only yesterday. 'Walk the Line' is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johnny Cash in person. To be honest, I didn't know this man before, however, after watching the film I am eager to listen to his songs and also to know about his first steps of becoming a great musician. The film is collected from the most significant moments of the singer's life. Beginning with the story of the tough childhood when there was a tragic death of his brother, then service in the army, the first wife and the beginning of creative activity. We can notice not only the story of Johnny Cash's becoming a famous singer but also we can see that this film is overlapped by different relations. Acquaintance with June Carter was a turning point for the singer both in his personal life and in his work, they start touring together and they have an affair. Then the black strip of Cash's life is shown, this is the divorce with the first wife, his drug addiction and how June Carter and his family help get rid of it.June Carter becomes the love of Johnny's whole life and she is a muse in his work. The story of their love is beautiful but it isn't very simple, there are many difficulties during the whole life. That's why they live a long and happy life together, because their relationship started with difficulties and they overcame problems together holding hands. The film ends with the moment when June agrees to become Johnny's wife. The singer waited it 10 years.Music plays a big importance in this film. All the songs are from the experiences of Cash's life. They quickly become popular among people because they are true to life. The film is at least a long one, but I liked it thanks to a wonderful game of actors.",10,0,0,5 March 2018
