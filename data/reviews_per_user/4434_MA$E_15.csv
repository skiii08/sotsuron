Casablanca," A Classic
","This is one of the best films of all time. Humphrey Bogart is one of the best actors ever and Ingrid Bergman is perfect for her role. My favorite character is played by Peter Lorre, he is wonderful. The story is great and there chemistry is amazing. Casablanca is perfect.",Null,1,1,16 August 1998
The Big Lebowski," One of the funniest movies
",When I saw the trailer for this I thought it would be like Fargo. Actually it was so funny I couldn't stop laughing. Steve Buscemi and John Goodman are really funny. If you haven't seen this and are in the mood for a comedy or action film you should rent it.,Null,1,3,16 August 1998
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," I've never laughed so much during a western before
","Not only is this one of my 10 favorite movies of all time but it is the only western that you could also call a comedy, adventure, drama with a great script and excellent preformances. Even my little brother who doesn't understand its award winning preformances or script, liked it because of its action and humor. Robert Redford gives what maybe is the performance of his lifetime. Paul Newman does even better. I was very happy this made AFI's top 100 movies. What I am trying to say is if you haven't seen it you should and if you have watch it again.",Null,0,3,28 November 1998
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," How I Learned To Love This Movie
","The first time I watched this film I thought of it as more serious than funny, most likely because I was young and nieve. The second time I watched it I saw the humor and enjoyed it more. I have come to learn that this was the first Dark Comedy. Stanly Kubrick is probably the best director of all time because he has a classic in ever movie genre. Dr.Strangelove for comedy, A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Oddessy for science fiction ,The Shining for horror,Full Metal Jacket for War, and The Killing and Sparticus for action. Yet again Kubrick proves he can prevail in any genre including comedy.",Null,0,0,16 August 1998
The Usual Suspects," Superb, One of the greatest films ever
",The Usual Suspects has one of the best endings I have ever seen and some of the best acting I have ever seen.Kevin Spacy won for best supporting actor although I believe he should of been nominated for best actor because he was the main role in the film. If you havn't seen it yet you will be in for a big surprise if you do watch it.,Null,1,2,16 August 1998
Good Will Hunting," Great Movie
","Good Will Hunting was a great movie. The acting was sensational especially Robin Williams, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck. Minnie Driver could of been better. I will agree with others that say its good but not perfect.If you dont enjoy continual swearing you wont like this film. I dont care how many bad words are used as long it's a good movie.",Null,0,1,16 August 1998
Schindler's List," Not just a movie
",Some people consider this a war film. I consider it a classic. When I saw this film for the first time I really felt bad about what happened to people during the war. I was happy that this film was shot in black and white because some of the gore I probably couldn't stand in color. Spielberg has definitely surpassed his Jurassic Park stage and moved on to better work like this or Amistad. I cant wait to see his new movie Saving Pvt. Ryan because it is also about WWII. If you watch this whatever your age it will effect like no other film can.,Null,9,13,16 August 1998
2001: A Space Odyssey," To some it is strange to others like me it is beyond description
",This story is not just about a computer with a mind of its own. It is the story of the evolution of man trying to overcome the evolution of technology. Therefore if you watch it with that in mind you will understand it and not become bored or confused. All I can say is Kubrick proves how powerful he really is.,Null,1,4,16 August 1998
Titanic," Very Bad
","When I was watching I liked it a little but afterwards the more I thought about the more I disliked it. The thing that made me more mad was that it somehow managed to steal Oscars from L.A. Confidential,Good Will Hunting ,Full Monty,and As Good As It Gets.I have seen all of them and any one of them should of won. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are probably the worst people in the world both of them are stuck up and ugly. James Cameron is a great director but this time he has sunk as low as the Titanic.",1,26,56,16 August 1998
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A Great Film
",The Bridge on the River Kwai is one of the greatest war films ever. If your looking for a good war film this is it. Also it is great for kids because there is no swearing or sex. Only a little Violence. I highly recommend this film.,Null,0,1,16 August 1998
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best movies of all time
",When I first saw this film I wasn't that Mesmorised but as I thought about it I began to notice it's Symbolism. The more I thought about it the more I liked it and now it is my second favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of are generation and the thing I love most about him is his voice. Tim Robbins is perfect as a quit sincere Andy Dufranse.This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves more publicity from critics.,Null,3,5,15 August 1998
The Truman Show," Jim Carrey at his best
","After watching The Ace Venture Movies,Liar Liar, and Rubber Face. I never thought Jim Carrey could pull off a dramatic role but he did and with great talent. If you are wondering why so many people loved this film it was most likely its symbolism",Null,1,2,16 August 1998
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Quality Sci-fi
",Star Wars and its sequels may be the only great sci-fi films. Harrison Ford is great and James Earl Jones has a great bad guy voice. I dislike Mark Hammil. The best characters are definitely R2-D2 and C3PO. Even the sequels live up to the expectations of the original. Not to mention it has a great story and effects (for the 70's). The thing I like most are the funny looking characters.,Null,0,0,16 August 1998
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Funniest movie ever
",I could not stop laughing. If you havn't seen it you should,Null,0,0,16 August 1998
The Godfather," One of the most amazing films ever created
","The first time I saw this I was speechless. This is obviously the most excellent film ever. With a near perfect cast. A great Director. The music is one of the best things about it, I love the Godfather song. Almost every scene is unforgettable. A Perfect Film!!!!!!!",Null,0,2,16 August 1998
