Midsommar," Midsommar is just a dish which simmers endlessly and turns out crap
",Nothing special. Just average. Engaged me in parts but the overall story is a letdown. Didn't enjoy the climax at the end. It felt like something was missing and it all turned out to be a bland story. Wish they did more.,5,0,1,13 March 2020
It Chapter Two," Good but not great!
",Good movie. Not as exhilarating as the first one. Goes down tempo few times throughout the movie and not as coherent as the first one is. Never truly felt scared in this one. However to see how the story ends it's a good watch for sure.,7,0,0,31 January 2020
Signs," Average. Boring. Bland.
","Extremely average, very underwhelming as a movie. The subject matter had such a scope. Felt like the Director's sixth sense was fantastic but he was taking himself too seriously on this movie with a waferthin plotline. Didn't feel captivating at all and was boring.",5,2,3,27 December 2019

","Extraordinary movie! This is what all movies should be! Magical, Exhilarating, Entertaining and Make you think!",10,0,0,27 December 2019
