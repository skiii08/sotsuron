The Benchwarmers," Not worth paying for admission.
","Earlier tonight, I walked into the theater with a very positive attitude to see this movie. As a fan of Rob Schneider and cheesy comedy, I expected to get some good laughs from this cast. After watching this movie, a new hatred is formed for the Napoleon Dynamite guy. He basically puts on the same act from Napoleon Dynamite, yet even less intelligent. There were no scenes in this movie that made me fall out of my chair laughing, however there were a few scenes worth a laugh or a smile. Nothing good here folks, just the worst Happy Madison film ever created. Save your money if this film is on your list of things to see, you wont like it even if you are a Rob Schneider fan.",4,9,19,7 April 2006
