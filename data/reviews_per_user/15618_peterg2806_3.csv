Lucky Number Slevin," One of the most mind boggling plots in film history
","Without a doubt, Lucky Number Slevin is one of the most complex movies ever. This is both good and bad. On the plus side, it absorbs and enthrals you. With so many twists, it is very hard to get your mind around what is actually happening. On the other hand, this is a film that is far too complicated to be a classic - it tries too hard to confuse the audience, and you come out at the end in a daze as to what the conclusion was. If you are someone who likes to watch movies where you don't have to think about what's happening, steer clear of this one. On a more positive note, the film is packed with stars giving five star performances. Josh Hartnett is very well appointed as Slevin, Lucy Liu is in inspired form as his sidekick, while Bruce Willis is in uber-cool mode as the Goodkat. He is the best character in the movie, and the scene in which he shoots two guards coming through a fake wall is sensational. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley did well in their roles also. Overall, a good film with some great scenes - but not a classic.",7,0,1,7 December 2006
The Polar Express," The Polar Express is a masterpiece of a Christmas film.
","This is one of the best Christmas films made in recent years. It is a masterpiece in capturing the magic of Christmas, and ideal to see at the beginning of December, when the season is really getting under way. So simple, yet so effective is its storyline, Polar Express will have you gripped from start to finish. Amazingly, none of the characters (except Santa) have names - but so enthralling is the film that you don't even notice until the ending credits! Tom Hanks gives an inspired performance as the voice of many of the lead characters. Perfect not just for children, but also for adults. My parents (50) and I (18) went to see it and loved it enough to see it again in 3D. I advise you especially to go see it in IMAX 3D - stunning is the only word. The film is made for 3D, with the train appearing to be coming out of the screen at you. Summary: The Polar Express is a masterpiece of a Christmas film. Not too long, but enough so that you feel all of the loose ends have been tied up.",8,4,7,26 November 2006
Casino Royale," Best Bond since Goldfinger
","Put it quite simply, this is the second best Bond film of all time. Only Goldfinger is better - and it would have to be a pretty perfect film to dethrone the Sean Connery classic. But it must be said that Casino Royale is a masterpiece in its own right. It gives the franchise a real kick up the backside, taking it from the post-cold war era into the 21st century. To many people it may not seem like a classic James Bond film with all the gadgets and far-fetched plots, but that format was getting a bit old and dated - 007 desperately needed a new look. And Daniel Craig certainly is a new look. He may be the polar opposite to the usual clean-cut, dark haired, slightly built 007, but whoever gave him the role was a genius. Craig is a muscular, blond, gruff Bond, and it works extremely well! The other main cast members are also excellent. Eva Green is one of the best Bond girls of recent times, while Mads Mikkelsen gives a superb performance as Le Chiffre, the bad guy (but not the typical psychotic, trying to take over or destroy the world). Many people criticised the producers for not having Q or Moneypenny in the film, and to be truthful, an appearance at least by Q would have been nice, but the plot didn't really have a need for him. Overall, some Bond enthusiasts may not like the gritty storyline, but Casino Royale reinvigorates a flagging franchise with a brilliant new look and a brilliant new 007.",9,3,8,6 December 2006
