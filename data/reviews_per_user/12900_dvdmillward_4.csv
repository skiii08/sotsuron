The Ring," most over-rated film ever.
","the ring basically tries to do what the original version(ring) tried to do and scare us. But unfortunately i feel it didn't do the job right. The story focuses on a tape that when you watch it the phone rings, you answer it and a voice on the other side says 'seven days' then you have seven days before your death. This story is based around a reporter who is attempting to figure out why a group of people died at exactly the same time. It just so happens that they had watched the tape with one an other. You are killed by a dead girl named Samara.Of course the reporter (naomi watts) watches the tape then shows her ex the tape. she knows death is coming her way so investigates the matter further.",1,0,2,31 March 2005
Se7en," intelligent, and truly disturbing
","this film is purely sick and purely magnificent. it is about two police, David mills (brad Pitt) and William sommerset (morgan freeman) investigating murders which appear to be from a killer using the seven deadly sins for his moto. the murders are in graphic detail and this movie will truly disturb you and stay with you a long time (look out for the sloth scene). with quotes such as 'Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention', you just know 'john doe'(Kevin spacey' is one sick mentally disturbed man. the twist will blow you away and David fincher directs one of the greatest films to be made in my mind.",10,0,1,26 May 2006
Fight Club," phenomenally good. better than reservoir dogs.
","fight club is about a man (edward Norton) who's name you don't know and he has everything he wants except he cannot find much joy from life so he goes to clubs where people have been diagnosed with different kinds of cancer so he can sleep better meaning his life is much more worth living until another faker comes and it ruins his life. he meets a man called Tyler (brad Pitt) after his flat blows up and Tyler. him and Tyler open a fight club for young men frustrated with their simple life to beat each other badly so he stops going to the clubs, and finds him happier beating people to a pulp. he finds himself dedicated to fight club and anyone who messes with him are in for a beating. but is Tyler all who he seems he is.",10,1,4,7 April 2005
Reservoir Dogs," my favourite film ever. A clever low budget film.
","It is the aftermath of a robbery gone wrong. it mainly takes place in a warehouse showing you flashbacks of what happened. the men that went in were mr blue, mr white , mr brown, mr orange, mr pink, mr blonde, and the organises were joe Carnot and his son eddie Carnot- also known a snice guy eddie. But who came out of it was a different matter. Their was a set-up an undercover cop. But who. The action kicks off when an injured mr orange and mr white come back. Mr pink shortly after that and then mr blonde, of which took a police officer hostage just to get out of the shoot-out at the bank. they bring him in ask him questions but he says he doesn't know the undercover cop. So they beat him up. Eddie arrives and goes off with the gang to find the loot that mr pink stashed, but leave mr blonde to look after and injured orange covered in blood on the floor and the officer tied to a chair. he tortues the cop by slashing his face and cutting off his ear and from then on theirs hell on. at the end you find out who the undercover cop is.",10,0,1,31 March 2005
