Minority Report," 7 out of 10
","As with several of Steven Spielberg's more recent films, I find myself frustrated by Minority Report. There are many brilliant ideas, images and sequences within the first two hours, but much of that is thrown away by having the climax dissolve into thriller ending Type B.Plot-wise Minority Report could be best described as a paranoid science fiction cross between The Fugitive and Mission Impossible. Set in the Washington of 2054, murders have been eradicated by the experimental Precrime division. Detective John Anderton (an excellent Tom Cruise) heads this taskforce, catching would-be murderers from evidence provided by the Precogs - they see the crimes before they happen. The system is perfect. But what happens when Anderton is charged with murdering someone he doesn't even know, in 36 hours time? As the poster tag-lines say: everybody runs. Hunted by the ambitious Ed Witwer (Colin Farrell), Anderton can only rely on his mentor (Max Von Sydow) for help, as he desperately tries to prove that the infallible Precrime system can be wrong.Until the present catches up with the future, the film is extremely engaging. Spielberg once again proves that he is the master of both set-up and set pieces. He creates a believably neurotic future where technology has advanced in a natural way. Anderton's plight is convincingly constructed, whilst his flight is almost unbearably tense. The 'jetpack', 'eye' and 'spider' sequences are excellent examples of this and, in terms of suspense, are comparable with anything on offer at the moment.Unfortunately, after the pivotal scene where Anderton meets his predicted victim, the film falls apart. In place of startling originality we have a stultifyingly predictable ending that has been lifted directly from other films. The villain's unveiling is almost identical to that of LA Confidential's, and two climactic scenes are disturbingly similar to those of The Fugitive and Mission Impossible. Whilst it's sad that most of the few scenes that don't involve special effects are the film's weakest, this revelation might not be entirely surprising. Essentially Minority Report is the kind of chase movie that we've seen over and over again. Indeed, if it weren't for the climax, this wouldn't be a criticism - most stories are evolutions of all that's gone before. With the starkly blue look, draining colour from the screen, and an effective new spin on an old story, the disguise almost works.Do not doubt that Minority Report is very enjoyable. As a suspense thriller, it may well be the best of the year. But as dark science fiction, in the vein of Blade Runner, it misses the mark.",7,0,0,20 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," DVD Review
","There have been very few films in recent memory that can be said to be truly satisfying.  This is one of them.  Die hard fans of the writter trilogy may quibble at glaring additions (Saruman and Arwen don't really appear in the book), omissions (Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Wight sections) and creature designs (the Balrog being the most controversial), but for me they fit seamlessly into the film's story.Essentially the tale of the quest to destroy a magical artifact of immeasurable power (the titular ring), the first portion of LOTR concerns introducing the main players and embarking them on their voyage.  Along the way they will meet with friends and foes, sacrifices and betrayals, and ultimately a cliffhanger that deals with both loss and redemption.  The script was clearly adapted by fans of the original, and, for all its length, never drags.The casting and acting is, for the most part, spot on.  Ian Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom (as Legolas) all look as if they were born for the parts, and are supported well by an extensive array of recognisable faces, which includes Cate Blanchett, Christoper Lee, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm and John Rhys Davies.For once, amazing special effects are used to drive the story, rather than detract from it and cover any structural weaknesses, and somehow somehow sit more naturally on the small screen, than on the cinema where they threatened to fry nerve endings.  Combined with the spectacular cinematography of the New Zealand landscape, this film is the best kind of visual treat.  Peter Jackson's direction uses all the tools available to breath life into the diverse locales on display, and he handles the action scenes admirable. In particular, the Cave Troll scene, which wooed crowds in Cannes and was improved for theatrical release, has raised the benchmark for all other action films.  It's not all action, however, and Jackson knows exactly when to pull the heart strings.  The scene where the fellowship commiserate the death of a major character is particularly affecting.In terms of extras, the second disc is a dual-edged sword.  On the one hand the variety available provides an interesting look into the making of the film, and a mouth-watering preview of The Two Towers.  On the other hand there are no commentaries and a preview of the `Special Extended Edition' DVD to be released in November, may make you feel a little robbed and rue your lack of patience.Don't buy the DVD for it's extras, since you'll only regret not having waited a little longer.Buy the film because it's a brilliant showcase of talent, and it's hugely enjoyable to boot.9 out of 10 (Film), 4 out of 10 (DVD Extras)",9,0,0,20 September 2002
Signs," 6 out of 10
","Sixth Sense brought an original spin to the Ghost genre.  Unbreakable brought an original spin to the Superhero genre.  Clearly M. Night Shyamalan likes to bring original spins to his films, since, with his third major feature, he tries to bring an original spin to the Alien Invasion genre.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest, who has lost his faith in God and himself.  Following the pointless death of his wife, Hess throws in the collar and struggles to raise his children with the help of his brother, failed baseballer Merill (Joaquin Phoenix).  When crop circles inexplicably appear at his farm, Hess blames local pranksters.  But, as local and world-wide news begin to reveal, these signs may come from an otherworldly source whose intentions are decidedly ambiguous.Shyamalan once again demonstrates where both his strengths and weaknesses are.  The acting is uniformly terrific, and Shyamalan coaxes exceptionally naturalistic performances from both Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, as Graham's children.  Shyamalan, himself, is effective in a scene that reveals the truth behind Graham's loss of faith.Long scenes and slow, lingering shots crank the tension up to maximum for most of the film.  This tension is utterly deflated, however, by a couple of lengthy flashbacks that interrupt the grand finale.  Shyamalan has a tendency to undo a lot of his good work by over-explaining the clues (or signs, if you prefer) that are laid before us.  It's a shame that he falls back on this again, because, unlike his previous two films, there is no real twist for us to figure out.Stylistically, Signs is very similar to both Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, and many of the characters feel overly familiar.  Indeed Mel Gibson is directly interchangable with Bruce Willis, as a morbid hero who denies the truth behind his identity.  The mood and lighting also make Signs feel derivative of Shyamalan's other efforts.  However, it's a credit to the quality of this style that it still works to such an extent.  The distinctly personal view of a world under invasion makes you feel more for the characters than should be possible given the hokey subject matter, and will linger in your mind longer than most films this summer.",6,0,1,20 September 2002
