Ford v Ferrari," Good film but predictable
",The usual 'Hollywood' style rise and fall arc won't let you stop from appreciating this beautifully shot race wars film.,7,0,1,4 January 2020
Hereditary," Rise of Death-Cult genre of Horror
","After seeing Midsommar somebody recommended this movie. Well its not bad, however it seems like we're past the stage of Poltergeist & Good ol fashion spooky ghosts. Now everything 'Horror' has to be a demented sick cult obsessed with dead bodies and mutilations. Not complaining, I rather enjoyed this flick but the combination of paranormal stuff + death cults works better in this movie than some of the other Horror/Thriller movies I've seen lately. Overall it's enjoyable and definitely doesn't rely on jumpscares to spook the audience.P.S could have done without the 'audience must be dumb so lets highlight some books' part of the movie. Worth a watch nonetheless!",7,2,4,8 December 2019
Constantine," If Biblical paintings could move, this film would be that painting
","I loved it, sorry not sorry. To think the effects and CGI in this masterpiece still shine in 2019 would be considered blasphemy by some recent CGI-infested visual bore-fests and their cult followers. Constantine is a cult classic and will remain one for eternity.P.S this was my 6th or 7th watch since it first came out. High re-watchability!",8,1,3,6 December 2019
1917," Men will identify with this story of Brotherhood, Duty & Discipline.
","A mystifying experience, one that'll leave you yearning for just a little bit more of a lore set 103 years before our time. There's not much dialogue in the film yet the movie speaks a thousand languages, transcending through space and time reminding us of a time that was far from perfect yet still so perfect in so many ways. I seriously don't have words for this film so go out there and see it for yourself.One of a kind
10/10",10,1,2,18 January 2020
Midway," Movie for farm animals
","It would have been better if the world ended in 2012 (as Roland Emmerich always wanted) so we wouldn't have had to witness this absolute deuce of a film.In all honesty I love films about the great war and when the trailer for this first came out I was really excited. However this film is nothing short of watching a train wreck at extremely dull speed. Weak script, weak lead, weak characters and literally no character development even though the film is almost 2 and a half hours! Glad I never went to the theatre for this, it deserves a laptop screen at best.2/10",2,3,9,16 February 2020
