The Ring," True Horror is back
","All I can say is that this movie was SCARY!!! I am a big horror buff and it really takes a lot for me to say a movie was scary. Most horror movies I like are just entertaining.The Ring does a great job with introducing you to the horror about to happen in the beginning. The questions around what has happened is eventually answered in the end, but it takes you through a maze of events that have you glued to the movie waiting for the answers.What I really liked about this movie is how it was so scary with so little gore. Sure there were scenes that made you just shudder at the sights of certain things, but no real blood and guts. I loved that.I tried to write this comment without giving out to much information about the movie, because I think viewers need to look at this movie with no idea of what is going to happen or why it's happening. It is the meat and strengh of the movie...9/10",Null,1,1,3 July 2003
Spider-Man," Great Movie
","I am a big comic book fan and Spiderman, along with the Hulk were my favorites. I like the fact that even though their were a few differences in the character and the story, the movie pretty much stayed on point. The differences actually made the movie that much better (i.e. - shooting web straight from his wrist, as opposed to the 'web shooting' gadget he used in the comics).Overall, it is a great movie. Tobey was a perfect fit for the role. I am concerned that he will not likely reprise the role in the second release.",10,1,1,10 April 2003
