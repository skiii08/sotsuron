The New World," So Boring
","Oh my goodness. I am not going to go as far as saying this is the worst movie of the last year but it is definitely the most boring, hands down. I mean it was so unnecessarily long. I am not sure what the director was on while shooting this. Maybe it was the script that made this movie so god-awfully boring. I saw no apparent climax and no apparent resolution. I saw the cartoon Pocahontas and I think that was far superior. ---------------------------------------------------- -----possible spoilers here on------------- Christian bale's role was insignificant and the letter he wrote to his son didn't really add to the movie. They have a son but we see him for such a short time that it makes me wonder why they even included him. Pocahontas marrying a white man already shows that she joined them or that she is distanced from her tribe. Moreover the nature shots very excessive and unnecessary especially in the very end.",2,2,7,25 February 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," Wheres my conclusion?
","2/5(2 for the special effects)This movie had the promise of concluding Matrix Reloaded and it has failed terribly. I had such great expectations. The plot was extremely bad and there were a million things that were left unanswered and quite a few of plot holes. **Possible SPOILERS below**We still do not know how Neo stopped the sentinels. We do not understand how Neo separated his body from his mind. The rumor about matrix in a matrix is not true and yet Neo can blow up sentinels, a sentinel goes through Neo and what is more Neo can see in a 'mystic' vision after he is blinded. Why did Neo meet with the architect if he had to reach him in the real world? When Neo asks the Oracle a bunch of these questions the only answer we get is that he is 'the one'.. .. These are just a few questions amongst the many that I can list. For those unanswered the plot/script was extremely disappointing. In addition the ending was too cheesy. Machines agree to a truce? and let the humans free without caring about their power? Come on. Shame on Wachowski Brothers for having the final part of the trilogy this bad after two excellent movies.",5,0,0,13 November 2003
