The Hangover," Damn ! What a delirium !
","Sometimes, the gags are not so subtle and could be predictable...BUT the crazy/silly situations succeed in such a quick rhythm that THE MOVIE BECOMES SOOOOO DELIRIOUS !!! I HAVE LAUGHED SO MUCH THAT I WAS ON THE EDGE OF A HEART ATTACK,even if I'm a strong and healthy 29 years old man....Now ANY MAN WHO'S ABOUT TO BE MARRIED WILL DEMAND TO HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS THESE FOUR MEN !!!!And this movie reminds to every married man the great moments of fun between men he had before the greatest day of his life (or the worst if the wedding turns bad ;-))Personally, before my wedding, I was disguised into a giant condom, obliged to drink a horrible pumpkin+milk milk shake (...I HATE pumpkin so you imagine the result) and I've asked to a psychiatric hospital a moist and warm shelter...but I found no tiger in my room ;-)No more to say.Roll over",8,4,8,1 July 2009
