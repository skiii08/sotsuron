The New World," A masterpiece (with reservations) and amazingly, a true story
","I have been a fan of Malicks esoteric films since seeing Badlands over 30 years ago. I was greatly looking forward to this although I thought I knew pretty much what to expect for better and worse (particularly after the Thin Red Line) and so it proved to be. Stunning photography, good acting, a decent story told at a (very) leisurely pace and long shots of flora and fauna with birds squawking. These comments may seem a little cynical but this is what you get. Good points: Fabulous photography. The arrival of the English settlers to this New World is very well portrayed and the reaction of the locals to these aliens and visa versa convincing and plausible. The appearance and customs of the Indians  opps! - Native Americans is convincing (to me at least) and wonderfully strange. The experiences and adventures undertaken by the central character of Pocahontas is sensitively and movingly portrayed  the acting of Q'Orianka Kilcher was very impressive. Her turn to experience a 'New World' also comes in due course, when she travels to England and meets the King and Queen. Again, her wonder of the strangeness of this environment is convincing and moving. The recreation of 17th century Merrie Olde England is well done although oddly brief, particularly given the pace of the story up to this point. Bad points: Well, I like beautiful pictures as much as the next man and make no mistake, this is a beautiful film to watch but I did get restless seeing shots of a bird flying over a river for the umpteenth time. The voices-over as the characters wrestle with their inner demons I found a little tedious also. Yes, I know Malick teaches philosophy but I'm not convinced that this technique adds much to our knowledge of the motivation of the characters and often sounds pretentious. The fact is that the first two-thirds or thereabouts of the movie is too long and would have benefited from having 30 minutes snipped off. As previously stated, the trip to England and the consequent climatic events move at almost too brisk a pace (maybe relating to budget  I assume very expensive to create crowd scenes in a convincing 17th century environment?). The movie then ends rather suddenly. One aspect which is fascinating and I suspect may not be appreciated by all viewers is that the story is true. The essentials concerning the story of Pocahontas, Captain Smith and John Rolfe are largely accurate as best as can be judged from the detailed documented accounts from the period, including the presentation of the 'Indian Princess' to King James and Queen Anne. I greatly admire Malicks work  he paints a large and ambitious canvas. The artistic and cinematic quality of The New World is beyond dispute and it is in literally a different league from most of the trash that passes for cinema currently. Terrence just needs some decent scissors and an editor that can argue the case for steady and consistent pacing and plot development. And maybe a few less squawking birds next time..",8,1,4,6 June 2006
Chinatown," One of the great films of all time
","It may sound a little dramatic to call this one of the great films but I genuinely believe it to be true. I have been going to the movies for over 40 years and I can't think of any way that Chinatown could be improved or made better. I first saw it 25 years ago but watched it yesterday on TV and was again overwhelmed by how good it is. The other thing worth mentioning is that it has hardly dated at all. Certainly Jack Nicholson looks younger than we're all used to seeing him these days (me and him both!) but because the story is set in the 1930s, it could have been made yesterday. The cast, the locations, the script, the direction, the dialogue, the photography and that evocative score are all pretty much perfect. Above all, the great fast paced story with an ending that hits you right in the stomach has as much power today as ever. I'm sure that anyone reading this will have seen Chinatown but if not, go out of your way to see it. A true cinematic masterpiece.",Null,1,2,25 July 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Good and Bad WW2 Comic Book Fantasy
","I'm a big fan of Tarantino movies, or at least the best of them such as Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. I believe him to be a man who genuinely loves cinema, which is a pretty good start. So how does this stack up? Well, I guess that it left me with mixed feelings. The acting is actually pretty good and the interesting cast give a good account of themselves. The story is obviously ridiculous. I don't believe that QT expects it to be taken seriously. This is comic book cinema with comic book characters, good guys and bad guys. There is a fair amount of graphic violence, maybe a little more than was necessary to make the point. I think the problem I had was that the whole thing was too much of a joke, the kind that sounds good fun after a night out with friends but which usually you realise isn't going to that funny when you review it in the cold (sober) light of day. This may sound pretentious but given that we know QT can make outstanding memorable movies, is this elaborate joke a little over the top and a waste of time and resources? On the other hand, it kept me glued to the screen for almost two and half hours, which is no mean feat. Also, I find it interesting to speculate - what if this was a new low budget movie by a director that no one had heard of previously? Answer I suspect - instant cult classic. Maybe I'm foolish not to join in and enjoy the joke more but I have a nagging feeling this will be forgotten quite quickly.",7,0,1,14 January 2010
Juno," Enjoyable, charming but everyone just too nice and sensible to be real
","The bottom line is that I really enjoyed this film, despite the feeling of having been manipulated. A well made movie with mostly terrific cast and a story about real people facing a human crisis in their everyday lives of the type that many of us are familiar with, a 16 year old schoolgirl from a 'respectable' middle class background getting pregnant. The reaction and behaviour of the characters is sensible, humane and comforting. What a better world it would be if everyone were as wise, kind and practical as the characters. This really is the issue that gave me (and other reviewers) significant reservations  people are not for the most part like this in real life. Sure, some major problems do have a happy outcome but very often they do not and things rarely go as smoothly as they do in this story. Ellen Page has received major plaudits for her undoubted acting ability but I found her a little too wise and articulate for her age, her performance and spiky charm too polished to be authentic. The star for me was Michael Cera, his characters discomfort, awkwardness and lack of confidence was far more convincing and closer to people of that age that I know. I think probably best to regard this movie as a modern fantasy rather than a snapshot of reality. But the movie does have a warmth and charm and certainly provides an enjoyable evenings entertainment. One further plus for me incidentally was the soundtrack, brilliant quirky little tracks that provide a perfect accompaniment to the story. Overall, see it and enjoy being manipulated.",7,2,8,24 August 2008
Interstellar," Nolans 'not quite' 2001
","This movie has achieved a very high rating on IMDb and so I had a very high level of expectation before seeing it. My one concern was that I've found Nolan's recent work (particularly Inception) to contain some excellent ideas and cinematography but to be overlong and rambling in places. I found Interstellar to suffer from the same faults. Very interesting ideas, great cinematography, solid cast (although I wish Matthew McConaughey would deliver his dialogue more clearly and not mumble so much. He doesn't seem to have fully recovered from his role in True Detective and I couldn't understand what he was saying much of the time and I was not alone in this. A number of reviewers have used the word 'epic' to describe this movie. I'd be more blunt and say it could have done with some more effective editing. A friend of mind made the comment that it may take several years to get from Earth to Saturn and when you see Interstellar, it feels like you're making the same trip! An exaggeration maybe but the movie is very long and lacks pace at some points. Not all bad news however - some sections are very impressive and visually spectacular, although some ideas have been borrowed from other sources - obviously 2001/ 2010 and Arthur C Clarkes story 'Rendezvous with Rama'. Definitely worth seeing but I don't share the 'masterpiece' line of some reviewers. Good but not great.",6,4,7,2 April 2015
The Village," Unusual, ambitious post 9/11 drama
","Like many people, I was expecting a 'Stephen King' type horror/slasher movie (this is what the trailers and publicity suggested) and initially, this is what you think you are going to get but the film developed into something more ambitious and for me, unexpected and very interesting. OK, the twist at the end is slightly implausible but I have to confess that I didn't see it coming. As a comment on our current 'post 9/11' fear of the outside world and the enemy at our gates, I thought the film intelligent and thought provoking. The acting and cinematography I found of a high standard (the cast were for me excellent) and the portrayal of a community isolated from the world and the general spooky and unsettling atmosphere I found haunting and very memorable. Having seen it, I wanted to see it again and I enjoyed it as much (or possibly even more) the second time around on DVD. Highly recommend but see it when you are in a thoughtful frame of mind rather than with the lads after a few beers.",8,0,1,14 May 2005
No Country for Old Men," Great expectations, but left me slightly disappointed
","I'm a huge fans of the Coens and have enjoyed every one of their films, going back to Blood Simple. Having read rave reviews which referred to this as 'their masterpiece', my expectations were very high, and possibly this is why I was disappointed  maybe I was expecting too much. Make no mistake, this is a very good film, in a different league from the majority of thrillers. The cast selection is very interesting and the performances excellent. Tommy Lee Jones is at his best, and Javier Bardem is a truly memorable villain, something really special. The cinematography is excellent, typical Coen standard. The story starts well, a tense mystery and sure enough the suspense builds. So why my disappointment? Well, as others have said, the latter part of the movie doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first half and the ending is something of an anti-climax. The movie doesn't quite fulfil initial expectations. It seems to finish rather than end. Other critical comments are that Woody Harrelson is rather wasted, a relatively brief 'walk on' appearance. Some of the dialogue I found very difficult to understand. The characters have a tendency to mumble  OK, I'm a Brit and maybe my problem in not understanding 'Texan'. On reflection, the ingredient I missed most was the (black) humour, found in Fargo for example. See this film by all means and you're hopefully enjoy it but I don't believe it to be quite the masterpiece that many have said, just very good, which is better than most productions manage.",7,0,2,13 August 2008
District 9," A very clever and unusual film, not just for Sci-Fi Fans
","To say that this is 'more than a sci-fi movie' is disrespectful to the (relatively modest) number of excellent sci-fi pictures over the years – those that transgress the genre - but I'd like to stress that those readers who are not great fans of sci-fi should see this. It is by any standards a well-made, original drama that entertains and holds the viewers attention for almost two hours. Yes, there is a spaceship and funny-looking aliens but above all, this is a significant film with strong elements of excitement, humour and pathos. I'd read the mostly very positive reviews before seeing it so my expectations were high. Even so, it actually exceeded my hopes (a rare pleasure).and both myself and my partner agreed that it was better then we expected. I genuinely believe that it will very soon be regarded as something of a classic. If you enjoy well made, quality cinema, I'd be very surprised if you are disappointed. Without wishing to labour the point, a word of warning to those possibly junior movie fans who see the spaceship in the poster and like a video-game type of picture with killing and explosions from beginning to end - there are some of both but you'll be largely disappointed!",Null,0,3,22 February 2010
Inception," Very clever idea but over-long and over-complicated
","We have a phrase in the UK about 'too many eggs spoiling the pudding' and my view against the majority of reviewers, is that Nolan had committed the same sin with Inception. On the positive side, the story has an intriguing and largely original premise. The cast are all pretty much excellent – DiCaprio and Page and but Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy also and great to see Tom Berenger again. Also a brief cameo by Pete Postlethwaite who I heard only today has sadly passed away – a great actor who appeared in some really interesting movies. Inception clearly had a big budget – masses of CGI (maybe a little too much?). All the ingredients are there but I felt that the script was a layer or two overdone. The 'arctic' section for example was largely unnecessary and didn't add anything to the story, other than dubious justification for extended gun play and James Bond style explosions with people flying through the air. Make no mistake, the story is very clever and bold but the plot lacked tightness and tried to be too clever, to the extent that my attention wandered as did that of those with me (all 'serious' movie fans). I really felt that 30 minutes or so could have been shaved off the running time and that the momentum of the story would have greatly benefited as a result. I know that Inception has achieved cult status and that this review will be considered blasphemy by some but I really feel that this thriller could have been so much better with tighter editing and direction.",6,4,6,3 January 2011
Munich," Typical Spielberg, for Better and for Worse
","On the plus side, the cinematography is as good as it gets. Spielberg is an undoubted master of the field and as a lover of cinema, I regard him as one of the truly great exponents, a genius. On the downside, his stories tend to feature a cloying sentimentality (AI, Saving Private Ryan etc) and this aspect inevitably detracts (at best) or ruins (at worst) the overall experience. And so with Munich, we get the standard Spielberg package. I strongly feel that if a movie is to feature a series of historical events, particularly a recent tragedy such as the events portrayed in this film, then it should be factually accurate and this film is not. There is no mention of the innocent waiter who was murdered by the Israeli squad as a result of mistaken identity for example. Now I'm not trying to make a political point here. As far as I am concerned, those responsible for the murder (that word again which I use intentionally) of the Israelis at Munich (or the murderers of innocent unarmed civilians in any circumstances) deserve everything they get. The suggestion that a series of unlikely methods of killing the perpetrators was used  exploding beds and so forth  each different from the previous, is complete fiction. Without wishing to sound too pedantic, the danger with this approach is that many people believe that what they are watching on the screen is fact. One IMDb reviewer comments that 'Spielberg gives us one hell of a history lesson'. He does not. Overall then, a decent action thriller, no more and no less.",6,0,3,18 July 2008
