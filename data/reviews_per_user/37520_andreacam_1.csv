E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Spielberg marketing masterpiece
","The movie is a below average 80' film. The story is not very interesting. The pace is really slow and often boring. You will not keep a today kid sitting 2 hours watching this bore festival. The masterpiece is how Spielberg & Friend brainwashed so many people to think this is a good movie, for some even a great movie!",5,0,2,22 March 2020
