Requiem for a Dream," f*****g amazing
","normally a film wouldn't drive me to curse online... this one did. Brilliant brilliant brilliant brilliant. Brilliantly told. Brilliantly acted. Brilliant and stunning photography. Brilliant and pitch perfect sound design. Sound designers and editors should use this film as their bible. Brilliant direction. Brilliant film. Ironic for a writer, such as myself, to be so redundant in his adjectives - but this movie, for what it's worth, rendered me speechless.",10,0,0,20 August 2001
Crash," Open your eyes people! This is without question one of the worst films ever made!
","This movie is bad. Just bad. In absolute terms, bad. The dialog jumps off the screen and slugs you in the face with its thoroughly artificial banter, and then defecates on your ability to detect even trace amounts of subtlety. Racism is bad. Racism in Los Angeles can be especially bad. I live in the city of Angels, I can attest to that. What is so terrible about the bigotry in Los Angeles is its insidious nature. It creeps at you with a knowing glance, or a swallowed word. Until just at the edge of a full on fist-fight, It almost never comes right out and says, 'why did he have to be black!' I can see quite clearly that the car-jackers are black, the detective's partner is hispanic, the DA is white. As long as there is film rolling through the projector, I can let the visuals, music and words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion. Characters emote, and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions. That is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience. That trust is raped by this movie. A good film pulls you in directions as an audience, and it steers you with cues to drive to a point. This movie beats you down with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way. My unanswered question is, why did we as a society say collectively, 'thank you?'",1,34,59,7 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Truly Remarkable
","After seeing an early press screening of LOTR:TFOTR, I was left with very few words floating in my head...  epic. fantastic.This is the reason the movies still exist. This is why we make movies. This is why television will never outdate the silver screen.
LOTR is an epic fantasy that has range and scope greater than any movie I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I don't feel it is the best movie ever or even of the year (Memento seems to have a lock on this year's best), but LOTR is an event film in the purest form.We needed that now. Peace.",10,0,0,11 December 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Easily one of the greatest films of all time
","There really aren't any words to truly describe the beauty of this film. Breathtaking. Awe inspiring. Sublime.  Being part of a generation where 'wow me' special effects and 'eye-popping' action sequences are usually enough to pacify us into thinking a movie is great, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon refreshes the film-loving spirit within, surpassing all expectations and setting a new-old standard of filmmaking. The swordplay ballet is indeed mesmerizing, but pales in comparison to the emotional ballet Ang Lee, Chow-Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and the brilliant Zhang Ziyi bring to life on screen. Simply remarkable.On a personal note, I work in Hollywood... I was literally at my wits end in frustration at this often vapid industry. I was on the verge of packing it up, and moving back to television in New York... Then, upon experiencing this masterpiece, my love for the movies was reborn, refreshed, invigorated. Thanks, Ang.",9,0,0,12 June 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," lots of fun, ignore nit-pickers...
","I attended a press screening of HPATSS, a week before the general public, in a theatre full of other press and their families. As I left the theatre, I heard lots of rumblings. Mostly positive. Some of which annoyed me enough to write this now... Right off the bat, let me express that I'm angered that a movie was made in the first place. Finally kids and adults around the world were reading, loving reading, and using/rediscovering their imaginations. Now instead of picturing Hogwarts in their heads, we all see in our heads the same visualized Hogwarts, Harry, etc...  But a film was shot, and can't be ignored, so - that said, allow me to get to the film:I really enjoyed the movie. Easily one of the years best, and sure to be a classic (It's no Memento, but that's ok). As a former Nickelodeon employee, I felt it was my responsibility years ago to read what everyone in that demographic had already read - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I found the book to be incredible, and couldn't wait for the Chamber of Secrets. In any event, I'm a huge fan of the books, of which I've read all of them more than once. I figured if any one could find fault with a HP movie, it would be me. After all, I'm a a critical person, a film school graduate, and a huge Harry Potter fan. I can't find much fault in the movie though. The only critique I have for it is that it felt unbalanced.
My real beef though is with the rumblings that the book is better. I'm constantly hearing it. Of course the books are better. I agree, full heartedly. The book(s) are great. Full of detail, fun, adventure. But comparing the two is unfair. A movie has a limited amount of time/space to tell it's tale. A book can always add a page, a scene, a detail. I must have heard 'they left the _________ scene out of the movie' a dozen times. What an annoying criticism. If they shot every scene of the book, the movie would run 4 hours at least. Why is it so hard for us to just sit back and enjoy a really fun movie, without looking for fault? There's so much to be appreciated in the movie, and perhaps most importantly I think we can all appreciate that it's possible this movie will encourage more people to read the books, and just read in general.",7,0,0,16 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," simply breathtaking
","There is nothing to comment on this film that hasn't already been said, which is simply due credit to the producers and directors of this masterpiece: this is one of the greatest films of all time, and a perfect end to what has been an unprecedented journey of filmmaking.",10,0,1,19 December 2003
