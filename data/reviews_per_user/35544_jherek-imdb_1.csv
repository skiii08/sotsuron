Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," troubling and disturbing
","In many ways, this movie is impressive: the fact that they could pull off all the stunts, get real people to perform on camera, Sacha Cohen's performance, etc. Exposing bigotry, prejudice, and other failings is also a good thing.I don't have a problem with nudity or political in-correctness. I don't have a problem with the way the movie exposes bigots; some of the people in the movie deserve being held up to public ridicule.But along with Cohen's deserved victims, there are too many innocent victims for my taste; people who are probably well-meaning but still be made to look bad. I found the treatment of the Romanian villagers particularly heartless.Overall, this movie just doesn't come together for me. Intellectually, I actually think it's more important and poignant than most other comedies. But, in the end, I just found it too unpleasant and troubling to work for me.",3,2,5,8 April 2007
