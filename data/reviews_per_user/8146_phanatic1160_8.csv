The Hangover," wow, this movie was really over-hyped...
","expecting a laugh riot after the huge buzz and the top rating here on IMDb, i was rather disappointed by this 'chuckle-fest'. the first smile didn't cross my face until about half an hour into the movie, which is way too long for a comedy. this movie consists of a rather uninspired plot without any really fresh ideas, and of dialogue that seems mostly improvised. the endless 'beauty' shots of vegas also struck me as either needless runtime-padding or product placement.the solid efforts by the main cast make this one barely above average.(imdb: the 10-line minimum on these reviews is really annoying!)",Null,1,6,28 December 2009
Gravity," awesome cinematography and not much more...
","first the good: the opening sequence is absolutely masterful and pulls you right into the world of the movie. several big set-pieces later on also look and sound great. the very creative and effective sounddesign are also noteworthy.now the rest: was i watching the same movie as everyone else? because the version i watched had no emotional depth whatsoever, contained several ludicrous plot-devices, used 'audience manipulation 101' techniques and featured a few emotional 'character' scenes that were so badly acted it made me cringe.after the opening, i really really wanted to like this movie, but piece by piece it wore me down until in the end i was even a bit mad at it for looking so great but being so emotionally hollow and so sloppy with common sense.the scene where clooney untethers himself reminded me of a similar stupid pointless gesture from a movie i had hoped i had forgotten: 'vertical limit'.the long wait for a return of good science fiction movies continues....rating: 6/10 (slightly above mediocre)",Null,0,1,7 February 2014
Star Trek," how on earth is this in the top 250?!?!
","to illustrate how far from the original spirit of star trek this parody comes consider this:the beastie boys' 'sabotage' on a start trek soundtrack?! product placement for budweiser and nokia?? kirk driving a corvette??i am really glad i'm not one of those emotionally invested star trek fans, because if i were i'd be liable to start a vendetta against people involved in this production... ;-)this flick is just pure garbage... nevermind the bastardizing and 'remixing' of trek history - the plot is boring and weak, dialogue is laughably bad, no original ideas at all (most seem to be lifted from other mediocre scifi movies), one predictable sequence after another, the enterprise looks like an apple store...the only thing on the plus side are the main actors as they do a good job playing younger versions of these iconic characters.do yourself a favor and skip this nonsense or at least go in with extremely low expectations.J.J. abrams is fast becoming the new bret ratner... :-(",Null,12,21,7 November 2009
Spider-Man 3," How did this cost 250+ million?!
","i loved the first two spidey movies and rated them 8/10 and 9/10 respectively.unfortunately spider-man 3 is an unholy mess.while the first two movies had a great balance between character development and action coupled with great plots, this one is about 120 minutes of poorly written romance-drama and 20 minutes of mediocre action scenes. the dialogue is so weak it rivals star wars 2 - attack of the clones in its lameness. combine this with a plot that is about as interesting as an episode of some teenage-drama on television and you get quite angry during the movie's excessive running time.it is hard to believe the same people who made 1+2 were involved in this failure.save your money and if you *have* to see it, wait until the DVD hits the bargain bins which should be about 1 month after it's released.",Null,3,6,6 May 2007
Ender's Game," like 'Starship Troopers' without the fun...
","wow, what an uninspiring and bland movie. after being on the fence about watching it at all, i finally took the plunge. i should have listened to my instincts.the best comparison i can make is to 'Starship Troopers' but without any of the humor, without the biting satire, without cool creature effects and with child soldiers instead of adolescents.what's left over is a soulless Hollywood product that, while looking gorgeous, only manages to elicit yawns.i know we are all starved for halfway decent science fiction, but this one should be skipped.5/10",Null,2,5,1 February 2014
The Butterfly Effect," am I glad that I saw this on DVD and not in theaters!
","don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, but after reading about the theatrical ending i just had to point out that the director's cut is far superior to the version that was seen in theaters! the movie gets a much darker tone and the new ending makes it really work.i'm so glad i never saw the theatrical version, it would have totally ruined the experience of watching this movie for me. if you watch it on DVD, make sure to watch the director's cut first!!8/10--this 10 line minimum requirement when submitting a comment really blows--",Null,0,2,30 November 2004
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Cleverly made propaganda, but fails as a movie
","this is what a modern propaganda film looks like. from the opening shots of 'reel bad arabs' getting tortured onwards, discerning moviewatchers know what they're in for. promotion of transhumanism, royalty and aristocracy, glamour shots of weapons caches, pretending that intelligence agencies are necessary to keep the 'peace' - it's all there. in fact the movie packs so many agendas into a non-stop barrage that you barely have time to register them all.from a propaganda standpoint, this is really well made. but as an entertaining movie it fails.one predictable plot development follows another as if the movie was assembled from pre-fab elements off the shelf. when i thought the movie should be about to end, i checked the remaining time and was amazed to find out that there was over an hour left! yawn!i'm sure the adolescent boys who are the target audience loved this film and are lining up to join this or that murdering intelligence outfit, expecting to skydive and f**k Scandinavian princesses up the a**.for the rest of us - if you want to see a good stylish action orgy, watch 'John Wick' and forget about this insidious piece of propaganda.",Null,2,5,3 August 2016
Windtalkers," underrated action-fest
","if you expect a john woo-movie - i.e. lots of well-shot action sequences with an average plot, chances are high that you will like the movie. if you expect a serious war-film, you will be disappointed.note: the movie gains a lot by being watched on a big-sized screen with the proper sound-equipment (subwoofer, big speakers). it's LOUD and full of stunning visuals. just don't look for the plot or the message too hard!i loved it. 8/10",Null,1,2,4 October 2003
