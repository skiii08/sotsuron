Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Everything I expected. Watch out, Titanic!
","What can you say about a legend? Great flick, great SPFX. The coincidences the movie presents are a bit numerous, however. An awful lot of stuff seems to happen on Tatooine for it to be such an out of the way planet. The droids have a lot of coincidal connections with the main characters, as well. I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone, so I won't be specific. It was a fun ride, and I don't believe it deserves some of the negative buzz I have been hearing. Some people aren't happy if they aren't tearing something down.",9,0,0,23 May 1999
The Iron Giant," This is a great flick, and it's not just for kids.
","I had heard nothing but good about this movie, and it's all true. Well written, witty and visually impressive, this may be the best animated movie I have ever seen. My 6 year old daughter liked it, my 13 year old son liked it, and I liked it. It never talks down to the audience. For those who, like me, grew up on cheezy B science fiction flicks, check out the subtle John Agar tribute.",Null,0,0,14 August 1999
