Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'll keep it simple...
","I'd never associated words like 'slow', 'tedious' or 'incredibly dull' with the 'Star Wars' series... until I sat through 'Phantom Menace'. I was never the world's biggest 'Star Wars' fan, but at least the other three movies were entertaining and exciting to watch; if I wasn't a Natalie Portman fan I'd have walked out of this one early on.",3,1,2,27 April 2001
Watchmen," So-what-men
","I finally staggered through to the end of the movie, but it was a pretty hard slog; by twenty minutes in my girlfriend had decided that it was boring and found better things to do, and I was seriously flagging after an hour and a half. To be honest, I could have found better things to do than watch the rest of the movie myself.It's a couple of decades since I read 'Watchmen' the comic, but aside from a few changes to the ending, the movie seems to be a pretty direct copy of the comic to the screen, and that's one of the big flaws; that worked for 300, because it's basically a bunch of action scenes with some talking in between, but a comic as pretentious, talky and full of narration as 'Watchmen' makes for a very dull movie.And the direct translation from comic to screen is also problematic in another way: 'Watchmen' the comic just isn't very good.Sure, it may have won a bazillion awards, but ultimately it's a decent idea that was poorly developed; the end result is not particularly interesting characters doing not particularly interesting things while indulging in lefty student philosophising in a not particularly original plot. Had 'Watchmen' been a novel or a movie, it would have vanished into obscurity, it only received acclaim as a comic because so few comics of that era made any pretense at intelligent characterisation or plot.Another problem is that Moore himself seems to have little sympathy for anyone to the right of Stalin, and a writer with no sympathy for his characters can hardly expect the readers to have much sympathy for them either; Moore can do a good job with a 'superhero' like V (for Vendetta), but every character in 'Watchmen', with the possible exception of Rorshach, is basically a cardboard cutout.So ultimately we end up with a highly over-rated comic turned into a horribly boring movie where people I don't care about do things I don't care about for reasons I don't care about; and the only mildly sympathetic character is killed off by the others. Don't make the same mistake I did: you can find much better things to do with three hours of your life than watch this movie and then shrug 'so what?' at the end.",2,15,26,8 October 2009
Quantum of Solace," Unwatchable garbage
","The movie starts with an 'action' sequence where Bond is being chased through the mountains in some fancy car... or maybe he's chasing someone through the mountains... or maybe he's driving down to Brighton for an afternoon at the beach and some other people are chasing each other through the mountains... or... who knows? They obviously spent a ton of cash on this sequence but then they cut it together in three-frame chunks so the audience have no idea what the heck is going on.After this there's a brief discussion which seems to assume that the viewer just watched Casino Royale and can therefore remember exactly what happened in that movie (perhaps the fact that I can barely remember anything about it whereas I remember at least the rough plots of pretty much every other Bond movie I've seen should have been warning enough to me).Then Bond chases someone around town... or maybe someone chases him... or maybe Bond goes for a nice cup of tea as he watches a horse race while two other guys chase each other around town; again it's impossible to tell because of the appalling editing.Then he flies to... well, I don't know -- or really care -- because at this point we turned off the DVD.Never once in my life have I failed to watch a Bond movie to the end, until now... and, let's face it, there have been plenty of stinkers. But this is just garbage, and if it's the future of the Bond franchise, it's rushing towards a well-deserved death; the concept of a more realistic Bond wasn't a bad one, but not when you give $100,000,000 to a couple of film school students (OK, maybe the editor and director do have some track record -- I don't even care enough to look them up on IMDb -- but it certainly looks like the kind of movie that bad film school students dream about making).Seriously, avoid this movie at all costs; it's the worst 'action movie' I've seen in years.",1,25,35,28 June 2009
28 Days Later...," A Life Less Zombie-Filled
","I liked the first twenty minutes or so of this movie: in particular, the various scenes of an empty London were well done, though I must admit that even by that point I'd drifted away from the story enough to spend most of those scenes wondering how they'd shot them.After that, though, it all went downhill.The main problem I had, other than the confused script that couldn't really decide whether it was a zombie movie or a weak road movie that just happened to include zombies (even though there seemed to be obvious 'homages' to many of the most famous movies of the zombie genre) was that the characters were dumb and caused many of their own problems, leaving me with little sympathy for them. Oh, and the teenage girl wasn't exactly the strongest of actors either.SPOILERS: First, when faced with zombies carrying a disease that's contagious from contact with a small amount of blood, what do our heroes do? Well, the character who's determined to survive at all costs chops them up with a machete, just to make sure that the blood goes everywhere. Then when they have the choice between taking a tunnel under the Thames or crossing on a bridge, they take the tunnel and, surprise, surprise, nasty things are waiting down there. Then one of them catches the disease by being stupid. Then later when one of them is being chased by a group of soldiers, the soldiers totally forget even the most basic military discipline and let him pick them off one by one. The only other decent parts of the movie were the rats and the scene where the soldiers were fighting off a zombie attack in the night. More of that, less stupid people doing stupid things, and a decent ending, and it would have been worth watching.NO MORE SPOILERS: So, while this might have made an OK TV movie in the British post-apocalyptic tradition, I really don't think it was up for theatrical release... and, while they did a decent job of the cinematography considering the cost of the camera they shot it on, I'm certainly glad I didn't have to watch the low-res digital video images in a cinema. Increasingly I'm coming to feel that 'Trainspotting' was a one-off success for Boyle and he's never going to make a good movie again.",3,1,2,19 October 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Nice music, shame about the plot
","I like the songs, the juxtaposition of modern music to the 19th century was often amusing, and overall the musical set pieces are great: it's just a shame they felt they needed to add a plot. Maybe I've just read too many 'how to write a hollywood blockbuster' books, but to call it predictable would be a compliment... nor did I think that Nicole Kidman did particularly well in her role as the love interest.Not a horribly bad movie, not a great one, but it's a shame that the plot didn't live up to the music video interludes... I really liked the first 10-20 minutes, but was looking at my watch by an hour in. I can understand why some of my friends love the move, but it doesn't work as well for me.",6,0,2,13 June 2004
Event Horizon," What were they thinking?
","What an awful movie. Given the budget and the cast, I'd expected that it would at least be an enjoyable SF romp, but was sadly disappointed. In the hands of a more talented director the poor script might have worked, but the very blatant attempt to recreate an 'Aliens' style intro immediately put me off, and the rapid degeneration into 'Star Trek' style metaphysical nonsense pretty much finished the job even before the sub-'Hellraiser' horror began.The biggest problem is very simple: there is absolutely no reason for this script to be set in space. It would have worked at least as well with a bunch of kids getting killed in a remote house and a few thousand dollar budget. Instead, someone blew millions on this clunker which will probably put others off making big-budget SF for quite a while.
Yes it has some tension, yes, there are a few nice bits and pieces, but overall it's one of the few movies which has ever left me feeling nostalgic for '2010'...",4,1,2,13 June 2000
Die Hard," The best Christmas movie ever
","I saw 'Die Hard' in the cinema when it first came out (which dates me, I know), and just watched it on DVD for probably the first time since. What surprised me was the fact that it hardly felt dated at all: the biggest giveaway that it was an 80s movie was the use of a Japanese corporation as the site of the terrorist attack.This movie is certainly Bruce Willis' finest hour, and Alan Rickman's performance as the villain is brilliant too. But what really makes it for me, in this era where action heroes like the Matrix mob and Lara Croft are totally invincible and, therefore, ultimately boring, is that Bruce Willis is most definitely, well, vincible. He's far from fashionably dressed, spending most of the movie in his vest with no shoes, rather than run into a room with six terrorists with machineguns and shoot them all in glorious, balletic slow motion he... valiantly runs away, he's cut and bruised and while he leaves trails of blood around the building, more often that not they're his own. Bruce Willis plays an action hero who can get hurt and regularly does: quite amazing by 21st century standards. And, better yet, he's not doing all this to save the world, but so he can have a quiet Christmas with his wife and kids!Overall it's a whole lot of fun, with explosions, shootouts, a bunch of surprises, no dull spots, few unbelievable plot twists, good characters and a neat ending. After watching the movie it was interesting to imagine some of the other action heroes of the time trying to play Wills' role... what a screwup it would have been to have cast someone like Arnie or Stallone instead.",10,2,3,13 June 2004
Scream," Scream? Yawn, more like...
","I have to say I was seriously underwhelmed by this movie, though possibly more than I would otherwise have been had there not been so much hype about how wonderful it was. The first sequence with Drew Barrymore was very well done, and would have made a good short film, but the whole 'aren't I cool having all the characters in my 'horror' movie talking about horror movies' thing got very old very fast; it was a good idea, but overused to extremes.However, I was more put off by the 'we're making a movie for teenagers so we must make sure we explain everything VERY CLEARLY so everyone knows exactly what's going on' approach to the script: for the first half hour or so it seemed like we'd get a couple of minutes of plot, then an Exposition Break as some character had to explain to some other character exactly why they disliked them, or what their personal problems were, or whatever. Dull, dull, dull.In the end I gave up and watched the last half on fast forward. Ah, so that's who did it. Well, ho hum.Shame, I really liked Wes Craven's first 'Nightmare on Elm St' movie and the last half of 'Last House On The Left' is pretty much unforgettable (then again, so is the appalling dialog in the first half!); I think I'll have to watch both of them again to remind myself that he could make good movies once.",1,17,43,28 October 2000
