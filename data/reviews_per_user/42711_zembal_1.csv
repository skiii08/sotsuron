Mission: Impossible III," Great!!
","The movie opens with a great scene in which violence does the work. no one did it before, not De Palma or Woo. In this case, i think it says a lot already from the director. Then a couple of missions Ethan must do in several countries and the character lead by Hoffman its great, not to mention the entirely cast. I think the film its great, more closely to the first one and with a little of drama and violence that i have never seen in the previous ones. Great editing and sound, and of course...Locations!!!! I think its gonna be one of the Top 10 Movies of this year, In Box Office and in Action cinema. Cruise its one of the most great producers of his time. Great Job Tom!",8,2,4,4 May 2006
