The Rock," Very good, entertaining and a bit over the top (not meant negatively) film by Michael Bay
","The Rock is, like most other Michael Bay films excellent entertainment! Michael Bay succeeds again in making a very good film. I don't understand why there are people that hate all his films. Anyway, this film has everything that is necessary to be entertained: good acting, excellent score by Hans Zimmer, Nick Glennie-Smith and Harry Gregson-Williams; excellent action scenes and a beautifully done cinematography. In many films the action scenes can be a bit boring, but in a film directed by Michael Bay, the action is mostly pretty good. Some shots in The Rock are really beautiful. But I'm not going to go in detail. Just watch The Rock, you won't be disappointed!There's still 1 thing I want to say: I don't care what many other people say, I like Michael Bay. He's a good director!",8,3,4,11 November 2007
The Devil's Advocate," Very good film with an excellent Al Pacino!
","The story of this movie seemed very interesting to me, so I decided to watch it! And, it turned out to be very good! The film was exciting from the beginning almost until the end. I must say that the end is (however it's an unexpected end) might be disappointing! The acting is by Keanu Reeves and by Charlize Theron is very good, but it's Al Pacino that steals the show with an outstanding performance! The cinematography is also very good! I recommend this film to everyone! You will certainly enjoy it! Director Taylor Hackford, who is not really a famous director, did a real good job making this film!",8,0,1,4 January 2007
Scarface," Very good and entertaining film, but no masterpiece!
","Many people I know liked this film a lot, but I also know people who didn't like it at all and said it was stupid. So I wasn't sure if I would like Scarface. But I did like it! The acting was very good and the screenplay by Oliver Stone was interesting. The film looks dated, but that doesn't really bother. The good acting and the music make this film pretty good. It's not a masterpiece like some people say, but it's certainly enjoyable and entertaining. Brian De Palma did a good job directing this, but I wonder why this film looks so dated. Not that that disturbed me, but I just wonder. Very good film, certainly worth watching!",8,0,1,12 September 2007
Troy," Very good, spectacular, epic film!
","The story about the Trojan War always interested me, so I certainly wanted to see this movie. With 'Troy' I didn't get exactly what I expected. But nevertheless I thought it was a great film. The actors are all well chosen, except for Brad Pitt, who I thought was a bit miscast as Achilles. But Brad Pitt ís a good actor! The massive battle scenes are very well done and the special effects are also excellent! The music by James Horner is also very good! There are some historical inaccuracies, but they are (for most people) not disturbing. The only thing I didn't like about 'Troy' is that the Trojan Horse appeared too sudden. So if you're looking for a spectacular epic movie, you should certainly watch this!",8,3,5,1 July 2007
The Beach," In general a really good movie.
","Before I saw the the movie there were some negative comments about the film. Those comments didn't say the movie was bad, but that it was disappointing, for director Danny Boyle. It said that the movie isn't by far as good as his other well known movie 'Trainspotting'But, I don't really agree with those critics. (Almost) the whole first half of the movie I found really fascinating: very good acting and beautiful cinematography. Also the music is really excellent. After the first half the movie weakens a little, but it stays alright. Some people will find the end disappointing. The end is almost the same as in the book, and, I also found it a bit disappointing. In general, this is a real good movie, with good acting, beautiful cinematography, very good music and some memorable parts! If you haven't seen it, you really should see 'The Beach' as soon as possible !",8,0,1,25 April 2006
Empire of the Sun," Beautiful war drama by Steven Spielberg!
","This is an excellent film. But I expected nothing less than that when I was going to watch it, because it's a Steven Spielberg movie. Steven Spielberg is one of my favourite directors. And again I wasn't disappointed! It was a beautiful, amazing, overwhelming war drama! The acting by Christian Bale and by the other characters was very good. And, of course, like all Steven Spielberg movies, the cinematography was amazing! There are really some beautiful, memorable scenes in this film. Also the music, by John Williams is very good and fits very well with the film! I recommend this film to everyone! It's an beautiful, emotional film that is also visually excellent!",9,3,7,30 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A real masterpiece! First part of the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.
","I was stunned after seeing this film! It was especially visually stunning! I don't think I've seen any films where the cinematography was better than in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy! I was amazed by the power of this film! But, this film does not only rely on special effects!!! Everything is good about this film: the acting, the beautiful music by Howard Shore, the cinematography, the special effects, ... This film has also a few moving scenes. Shortly said: it's a masterpiece! Some people may have some difficulties remembering the names of all the characters. I also had that problem a little bit in the beginning. Everyone should see this film, and the other two films of the trilogy! This trilogy is a milestone in movie history!",9,0,0,2 January 2007
The Shining," Very good, exciting film. Near the end it weakens a bit, but it stays exciting.
","I have never read 'The Shining' by Stephen King, so I can't compare with the book. When I was going to see this movie, I had high expectations about it, because it gets mostly very good comments. And indeed, it was a pretty good movie, but not a masterpiece like many people say. Director Stanley Kubrick did a very good job directing this (the atmosphere was very creepy), and Jack Nicholson is excellent in his role. Shelley Duvall I find less good. She acts well, but screams too much, certainly near the end of the film. The music is very good and this movie contains some excellent cinematic shots. You should try to see this movie as soon as you can. Your time won't be wasted!P.S.: The scene in the snow is brilliant!",8,0,1,11 November 2006
Collateral," Very good film! Excellent acting and amazing direction!
","'Collateral' is directed by Michael Mann, the director of 'The Last Of The Mohicans', which was a very good film. Collateral is also a very good film! The acting by Tom Cruise and James Foxx is amazing! Michael Mann is an excellent director, Collateral is beautifully directed! The first part of the film is better than the second. If the second part would have been as good as the first this would have been a masterpiece. But the second part was certainly not bad, it was good, but not as excellent as the first part. The music by James Newton Howard and the screenplay are also good! I can really recommend this film to everyone!",8,1,1,12 September 2007
American History X," Excellent, powerful movie!
","This movie really blew me away! Everything in this movie is good, the acting, the cinematography, the music,... Director Tony Kaye did an excellent job directing this film. Its nicely done with the black & white and colour scenes. Edward Furlong does an excellent job, but it's Edward Norton who gives this film so much power. His acting is amazing. After seeing this movie, I think Edward Norton is one of the best actors in the world. The cinematography is also excellent! Also the music is very good. The film stays in your head for a while after you saw it, because its a pretty harsh, raw movie. If you're looking for a movie that will give you a happy feeling afterwords, don't watch it! This film is a must-see! Its really amazing!",9,0,0,7 October 2006
Pearl Harbor," Much better than most critics say!
","I had seen this film already a few years, but then I didn't really pay attention, because probably I had some other things to do :) But yesterday I saw 'Pearl Harbor' again. And I really liked this film! Until now I liked all the Michael Bay (the director) films I've seen. So I hoped that 'Pearl Harbor' would be good! And it was! I must admit, some scenes were a bit silly and , but in general this was a good film, with beautiful cinematography. Also the music by Hans Zimmer was very good! The acting is fairly good. This film is maybe not completely historically correct, but for people who don't know much about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, this film is interesting! Michael Bay also made a very emotional film and also the battle scenes were excellent. But when Pearl Harbor got attacked, the action took a bit too long! But nevertheless, I really thought this was a good film. Nice, patriotic film that has a few silly scenes, but that has beautiful, sometimes lyrical cinematography, amazing special effects, very good music and good acting.",8,1,3,1 July 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," Most overrated film I've ever seen! This is so boring!
","I really can't understand why anyone would like this film. I can't say much good about this. First of all the film takes much too long. It is so boring, there are almost no interesting scenes in the whole movie. Even the action scenes are boring. Director David Lean could at least have made the fight scenes exciting. There's also not much dialog in this movie. More than half of the time we see nothing but desert. Actor Peter O'Toole is acting like he has a face of plastic, his face expression is always the same. I don't know if the film is completely historically correct, but I doubt it. The Arabs are very stereotyply portrayed. The only thing positive to say about this film, is that the cinematography is very well done, certainly for a film from 1962. The music is sometimes quite good, but the music doesn't always match with the scenes.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, except to people who have insomnia. Watch this movie, you'll certainly be sleeping by the time its over!",5,7,26,17 August 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Again an excellent film! Amazing!
","Peter Jackson did it again! He made another beautiful movie! However, this is, in my opinion the least good of the 3 films! But that certainly doesn't mean I didn't like it!!!! It's still one of the best films ever made! The cinematography, the actors, the special effects, the music, the costumes, the landscapes,... Amazing! Peter Jackson is in my opinion one of the best directors I know!I don't know what I have to say more about this excellent movie! Everyone should try to see it! Even people who don't like fantasy, should give it a try!",9,1,2,2 January 2007
Transformers," Very good and entertaining film by Michael Bay!!
","Again, Michael Bay gives us a very good entertaining film from beginning to end. Transformers is a real blockbuster. It has everything necessary in it to entertain you from beginning to end: good acting, special effects, excellent cinematography, good story, excellent music,... Michael Bay knows how to make a movie, that's for sure! Shia LeBoeuf is very well cast as the lead actor, and also Megan Fox is well chosen because she acts pretty good and she looks nice too! The transformers are really well done. That surprised me,because I thought the robots would just be stupid fighting machines, but here the Autobots have actual emotions and that I really liked. I loved the interaction between the robots and the humans. The things Optimus Prime said about the human race were nothing less than beautiful and was one of the best parts of the movie. The film was also pretty funny sometimes. Now some critics apparently hated this movie, but I don't care at all. Almost everyone whom I talked with about Transformers liked it. And that is what really counts. Transformers is an excellent combination of action, romance, humor, emotions and CGI-effects. With all these things I still add the excellent cinematography and music and simply excellent direction in general. I've seen all the films by Michael Bay now and I'm really looking forward to Transformers 2 and 2012: The War For Souls!Go and watch Transformers! It's really good!",8,0,2,4 January 2008
Black Hawk Down," A masterpiece!
","Black Hawk Down is a really intense, intelligent, violent, moving film. I can't think of anything bad to say about it. Or perhaps that there is maybe a little too much violence for some people. But this violence makes this movie very powerful. The score by Hans Zimmer is a masterpiece en really haunts you. Of course, I expected it would be good because of the director Ridley Scott. But still, I wondered what the result would be if Ridley Scott worked together with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I can only say 1 thing about that: the result was amazing. This is a very very powerful film, which is well acted, has amazing, beautiful cinematography and has an amazing haunting score by Hans Zimmer. It's a very violent movie, but also very realistic! A true masterpiece!",9,1,3,4 January 2008
The Da Vinci Code," Excellent movie! Much better than most critics say! Follows the book quite good and keeps the same atmosphere as in the book!
","I was really surprised when I saw this film. I didn't expect so much of this movie, I thought that it wouldn't be very good. But I was wrong. I wonder why so many critics didn't like this film! The only possible reason I can see, is the acting by Tom Hanks. I can imagine that some people didn't like him in 'The Da Vinci Code'. I don't really know what to think about Tom Hanks in this film. I don't think he acted bad, he acted in a sort of strange way (it's difficult to explain), but I felt sympathy for him. But Tom Hanks doesn't have prove himself anymore as an actor, because, in most of the movies where he's in, he does a really good job. The rest of the cast also does a good job. Audrey Tautou does a good job as Sophie Neveu, and Paul Bettany is excellent as Silas. The direction by Ron Howard is excellent. He manages to keep the atmosphere of the book. The cinematography and the special effects are very nice, and the scenes at The Louvre (the glass pyramid) are beautifully done. The music by Hans Zimmer (who, together with Lisa Gerrard, made the excellent music for 'Gladiator') is very good and fits very well with the film! Don't pay much attention to the bad critics, and watch this excellent film!",9,0,2,11 November 2006
Titanic," Excellent, overwhelming and gripping movie that everyone must see.
","'Titanic' is an excellent movie! It's very dramatic, emotional, overwhelming, magnificent,... I was really impressed when I saw this movie, and I don't think I can say anything negative about it. Some people say that in the whole first half of the movie nothing happens. I don't think that way about 'Titanic'. From the first moment the two saw each other, you felt there were already sparks between them. Also the music is véry beautiful! This is a fascinating movie: it's dramatic, gripping, emotional, sometimes exciting, the acting is also good, the music is marvelous. One of the best movies ever made! If you haven't seen it, you should try to see it as soon as you can! Excellent work from director James Cameron, the whole cast and the whole crew!",9,0,2,26 April 2006
Mystic River," Sober, but good film with excellent acting.
","I thought this was a good but sober film without many colour. I don't mean anything negative by that, because that sober, grayish atmosphere certainly doesn't work negative. You could also notice that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, however for once, he doesn't act in a film that he directed. The films grabs your attention from the first minute until the end. Mystic River is good, especially because of the excellent acting by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. Also Kevin Bacon and the rest of the cast did a good job. The music (also written by Clint Eastwood) is quite good, but as I said, this is a sober film, so there's also not so much music in it. This is a good film, especially because of the excellent acting and because it grabs your attention from the beginning.",8,3,6,12 February 2007
War of the Worlds," Good film by Steven Spielberg. Excellent cinematography.
","Steven Spielberg made a remake of the old film 'War Of The Worlds'. I've never seen that old film, and I've never read the book, so I can't compare. But I thought this was a good film. The acting was good, the whole cast did a very good job. You could identify yourself with the characters. Of course the cinematography and special effects were amazing! There are some excellent and memorable scenes in it. This is not the same kind of movie as for example 'Independance Day' by Roland Emmerich. 'War Of The Worlds' is much more intelligent than 'Independance Day'. All in all, 'War Of The Worlds' doesn't only focus on the aliens and the Tripods, but also on the disorder of civilization, when a great disaster occurs. That is shown very well! Only one thing I still want to say, I thought this film was a little bit too short. If it would have taken a little bit longer, it would have been even better!",8,3,6,12 February 2007
The Terminal," Very nice, feel good movie by Steven Spielberg.
","However this is a film that is quite unusual for Steven Spielberg, I did have (like I have with all Steven Spielberg-films) high expectations. And, again, I got what I expected! Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors I know. With The Terminal he delivers another very good film. The story is quite interesting, the acting very good:Tom Hanks does an excellent job and Catherine Zeta-Jones is also very good! The music by John Williams is of course very good. The cinematography is also excellent: you can see that this film was made by an excellent director. I recommend this heartwarming film to everyone!",8,0,1,7 March 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Very beautiful, overwhelming movie! The best film of the excellent trilogy! Really blew me away! One of the best movies ever made!!
","This movie is magical! I liked the first and the second part a lot, but this was éven bétter! It's one of the best movies ever made! Everything about this movie is excellent: The special effects, the acting, the music, the cinematography,... Peter Jackson is an excellent director! This movie is a fantasy film that relies heavily on special effects, but you don't notice anything fake. The special effects have been executed perfectly! But this movie has more to offer than only special effects. The music is very good an contributes a lot to the atmosphere of the movie. A beautiful scene is when Pippin sings a song! Also the acting is very good! This movie is sometimes very moving. The battle scenes are very well done and the movie is very exciting a some moments. The direction by Peter Jackson is amazing, he combines amazing special effects with very good acting, emotions, suspense and beautiful cinematography (the scene at Mount Doom is, in my opinion, one of the best scenes in movie history). I don't think I have to say more about this movie. This movie is exquisite! If you haven't seen it, see it as soon as possible! You will be amazed!",9,1,1,7 October 2006
300," Nothing like you've ever seen before.
","300 is really a special film. It really looks spectacular. The visuals are amazing. The movie is (except for the actors) almost completely computer-generated, so of course visually, this is amazing. But this didn't come as a surprise to me, because I had heard a lot of things about the film. But what díd surprise me, is that the acting and the screenplay were also good. Gerard Butler is really excellent and the dialogs are actually quite intelligent. The music by Tyler Bates is also good, sometimes even excellent. The story itself is not that good, but it's enough to keep you entertained. Sometimes the battle/fight scenes are a bit too much, but they were really well done. Zack Snyder did a good job directing this film. Good entertainment, but not more than that. It's not a masterpiece.",8,0,3,9 November 2007
A Walk to Remember," Excellent, emotional film!
","A Walk To Remember has a special meaning to me, it is my girlfriend's favourite film and I saw it the first time with her! And, I must say, I was very surprised! I think this is an excellent film! The further the film goes, the more serious it gets. In the beginning, it's not that memorable, but the film gets better! The acting is very good by Shane West and Mandy Moore, Mandy Moore who also sang the songs in the movie. This film will really touch you, I can guarantee that! A Walk To Remember is an excellent film by Adam Shankman. Everyone should check this movie out! It's amazing! Don't be mistaken, this is not a romantic comedy, it's a romantic drama.",9,2,4,2 December 2007
Gladiator," A brilliant epic movie! Beautiful film!
","Gladiator is really an excellent film. In every aspect this film is very good! This film is visually stunning, but also the story and the dialogs are good and interesting. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and the rest of the cast do a very good job! Director Ridley Scott made an excellent film! Also the music is beautiful, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is amazing. Also the cinematography is excellent. This is an epic film that is excellent from beginning to end! Everyone must see this masterpiece! I've heard there are some historical mistakes in it, but I certainly didn't notice them, and even if there would be inaccuracies, they don't harm the film! A beautiful film!",9,1,1,12 February 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Good action film! Nice entertainment!
","This is quite a good film, however I think it's a little overrated. The acting is quite good, the cinematography is sometimes very good, and the chase scenes are exciting! The music is also quite good. But, in my opinion this isn't more than that. It's entertaining, absolutely, but nothing more. Matt Damon is smarter than the average action-hero. But for the rest this is nothing more than an entertaining action movie. Don't understand me wrong, I liked this film, but I think the film is a little overrated by many people! But, nevertheless it's a nice, entertaining movie.",7,0,2,2 January 2007
The Island," Beautiful, amazing film! A masterpiece!
","The Island is a sort of special film for me. I don't know exactly why, but it is one of my favourite movies. Well, actually I dó know why: everything in this movie is very good! The story, the acting, the music, the cinematography, the direction in general! The story is really intriguing and interesting; the acting is very good by Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor, but Djimon Hounsou and Sean Bean are even slightly more amazing. The music composed by Steve Jablonsky is amazing and fits very well with the movie. The cinematography is also brilliant. It's amazing how much beauty can be found in this film. Respect for the director Michael Bay! I liked all his previous films too, but this one is even better! I heard that it didn't do so well at the box office, and I think that's a shame, because I haven't seen many films that are as good and that had such an impact on me. There are many beautiful scenes and the end scene is really excellent. There are 2 véry small negative points: at some moment in the film, the action is a little bit too much and there are a few silly scenes. But these are only very small things that actually do not matter, because, like I said, this is a masterpiece! If you haven't seen it yet, go and see it as soon as possible! You won't be disappointed! Objectively speaking,this film doesn't have a bad rating (6.9/10) but it's still very underrated! If you watch it, try to watch it on an as big screen as possible. This movie is the best when you watch it in the cinema.",9,1,3,2 December 2007
