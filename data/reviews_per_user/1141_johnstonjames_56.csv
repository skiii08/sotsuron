Whip It," Childish. 'Princess Diaries' Meets 'Kansas City Bomber'.
","i felt bad about not really liking this. for one thing, i would love to encourage Drew Barrymore's directorial debut because she's such a great actress and more women film directors are needed in mainstream film. i don't think it was her direction here i think it was just the concept. her direction was actually very professional. another thing is this movie had such a great cast it was worth it for that alone. even though surprisingly, Ellen Page was not her best.the real stand out in the whole film was Juliette Lewis who was outstanding in this. her performance gave you a glimpse of what the film could have been if it was aimed at an older crowd and not teens.that was my problem with this. a roller derby movie that comes off like one of those corny Disney flicks like 'Ice Princess'. even Ellen Page's transformation from mousey little girl with glasses to tough roller derby queen 'Babe Ruthless', seemed less likely than the ugly duckling transformation in the 'Princess Diaries'. in 'Kansas Bomber', Raquel Welch was a mature, sexy, woman. Ellen Page is a excellent actress but, let's face it, she has all the sex appeal of a Minnie Mouse or a Holly Hobbit.Ellen Page is a really first rate actress for someone so young. she was near brilliant in the terrific 'Hard Candy', and she was cute and engaging in the funny 'Juno', but i thought after 'Juno' she wasn't going to make anymore kids movies. guess not. her performance in this movie is disappointing. it's dull and immature and lacks any adult sophistication. she is totally overpowered by Juliette Lewis's knock out performance and more interesting character. as a matter of fact, Page was pretty much upstaged by all the actresses. Barrymore and Marcia Gay Harden are pretty hard to compete with.the total innocuous, harmless of this kiddie flick confused me. i mean it's about the F'N roller derby. it's supposed to be mean and tough not a harmless film for kids. the minute Page falls in love with a boy who looks and acts like James Blunt and they have a mushy puppy love affair it pretty much turned me off to all of thisthis is definitely a kids film. mostly a film for little girls. the only problem i could see any parent having with it is probably the drug usage and the swearing. some parents do'nt care about that stuff. as a 49 year old male that stuff doesn't phase me. i suppose if i had a teen age girl i would probably worry about it a little more.aside from the performances of some outstanding actresses, the best thing i can recommend about this is that it's a good film for young girls. it empowers them and teaches them to toughen up for the hard knocks life can deal you. that's a good message and worth something. let's just hope it doesn't empower them to the point they lie about their age in order to join the roller derby. that or they get a tattoo or something.",6,1,4,14 October 2010
Love and Death," Mysteries Of The Universe According To Woody Allen
","love, life, God, death. what does it all mean? i suppose you could always ask Woody Allen, he seems to have the whole thing figured out. at least as well as anyone.his personal life aside, i really love Woody Allen films. no comments about how he messed up Mia Farrow and some fans that believed him to know and see all. in his personal life he's a schmuck, as a film maker he's got it all together. at least concerning his early films he does.my favorite Allen film is 'Sleeper'. but i've seen all of his early work and those films never fail to leave me in stitches.'Sleeper' may be his best, but 'Love and Death' could very well be his most profound. after all, it does deal with theological questions and tries to answer them with some surprisingly serious conviction. the film manages to go deep into serious questions without ever losing it's sense of fun and humor.some Christians might take some of this to task. as a Christian myself i really don't sit around wondering whether there is a God or not. but i'll have to say concerning some of these questions of purpose, i still am interested in the answers. Allen gets awfully silly about much of this, but his philosophical conclusions aren't any worse than the pontifications of a lot of great men. but i'm always a little skeptical and hard to please in this category, so irreverence works for me as much as anything.this is really good film making and great farce. the use of the film score from 'Alexander Nevsky' was a hoot. Allen is also very right. we should never take the 'serious' things in life too 'seriously'. maybe not even death.",8,1,1,25 April 2011
Sucker Punch," Interesting Chickie Flickie Extreme-o
","uh. well. i always say this, but how weird. i kinda liked it though. it definitely had intriguing production design and was a little more off the wall than the usual CGI SYFY gibberish. not that a lot of this didn't seem like demented gibberish, but strangely, i kind of got it and understood it. it felt a lot like female empowerment gear, but it had enough message about the inner self versus outside influence to even empower men with a certain amount of individualism. but mostly it was a chick action flick for teen age girlies.not that chick action films are bad. i actually sort of liked 'Barbed Wire' with Pam Anderson. definitely this film had elements similar to 'Barbed Wire' or something like 'Barbarella' or a Russ Meyer flick. but this film was a little bit more overblown and aimed at a much younger audience. i mean 'HSM' queen star Vanessa Hudgens was in this. need i say more? basically for babies.i thought it was kind of cool. had a cool enough soundtrack that's for sure. it had a real Stan Lee element to it. it also had the feel of a live action Japanese anime toon or something like that.young girls will probably like this and they probably should because it's probably pretty good for them. girls should be tough and independent but still maintain their femininity. nothing wrong with that and this movie was hardly exploitive sexually since there was no nudity and the stripper clothing wasn't really all that suggestive.there wasn't really a lot of gory violence either. lots of violence. just not gory violence. the only thing i really objected to was the violence against dragons. the girl kills a baby dragon and it's mother. i love dragons and people should know that dragons are cool and are our friends. killing dragons is so brutal and really uncool. especially baby dragons that never even tried to hurt these chicks. i thought the mommy dragon had a right to be peeved because they killed her baby. uncool.the rest of the movie was pretty cool though. more power to women throughout the world. but i don't condone dragon killing or cruelty against dragons. that was uncool.",7,1,2,28 July 2011
Source Code," Genuine, Authentic, Filmmaking
","Duncan Jones's 'Source Code' is such a good movie, and feels so fresh and original because it actually concentrates on the art of true cinema, photography, editing and timing, rather than CGI driven action and effects.even though a true sci-fi story, the directorial style of Duncan Jones feels more like works of Hitchcock than most sci-fi fare. even though the science fiction is good speculation and highly imaginative, the real focus is on unraveling the mystery and creating different levels of suspense.it seems rare these days when a mainstream fantasy film is more about the acting, screen story, and photography and editing, than a lot of showy CGI effects that always look like CGI and create somewhat of a stylized appearance. 'Source Code' was more about building mood than numbing the audience with big, flashy effects.Duncan Jones delivers some of mainstream filmmaking's more intelligent, thinking fantasy films. although not as good as his film 'Moon', 'Code' is still a thoughtful and intelligent fantasy experience that probably has more in common with DePalma's Hitchcock homage 'Obssession', rather than sci-fi like 'Inception' or 'Star Trek'.for myself personally, i always like a film that is authentically a film and doesn't rely to heavily on something like a large budget, star power, or gimmicks, and use them as a crutch to avoid achieving any real inventiveness or clever plotting and structure. 'Source Code' is definitely that kind of film and Duncan Jones seems to be that kind of filmmaker. genuine and original, relying on personal inspiration and imagination rather than showy, flashy tactics.",8,2,4,4 August 2011
Marie Antoinette," Delectable Entertainment Pastry. No Nutritional Value
","Sofia Coppola's 'Lost in Translation' was one of the better, more adult movies of the recent decade. this wasn't. this was pretty much a film for teenage girls. not much wrong with that, but not a very insightful look at history.so Mary Ann is now one of histories good guys(or i should say girls). i find that a little dubious. i don't know if she was the cartoon villain she is sometimes made out to be, but i'm not sure she made enough worthwhile contributions to be thought of as a admirable person or any kind of role model. i don't know much about Ms.Antoinette(don't have the f--k'in time),but real history, while not necessarily vilifying the one dimensional broad, is pretty ambiguous about her.the movie is great eye candy however, and it makes one helluva good teen flick for girls. i really thought the scene where Coppola sneaked in a pair of contemporary urban sneakers with Marie's shoe collection was extremely funny. and it was cool to hear the sounds of Bow Wow Wow's Annabel wailing over the soundtrack. and the costume design was uniformly excellent.the film never quite lives up to it's initial opening scenes that show Marie as an innocent young kid, but heck, it had such a great supporting cast, Marianne Faithful(Mick Jagger's ex-flame),Jason Schwartzman,Asia Argento,Rip Torn,Steeve Coogan(who i love)and Molly Shannon,i couldn't help but be entertained. if you like cake(i don't especially)then enjoy.",6,0,0,24 March 2010
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," What's The Password?
","if you don't know the password, i ain't gonna tell ya.for those of you who luv roger and know the password, you know what i'm talking bout.'Roger Rabbit' is one of Disney's best accomplishments and a true cinema classic that actually does make a certain amount of contribution to cinema technique and style.the combination of live action and hand drawn animation is hardly ever explored or done. there are endless experiments in CGI but very few utilizing this classic cinema technique. there are very few projects outside of Disney that do this. even Disney, who pioneered the technique, rarely used it outside of his television show and for theatrical features. aside from the amazing 'Three Caballeros', there are really only a handful of Disney classics using the process. 'Song of the South', 'Mary Poppins', 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks', and 'Pete's Dragon' are the only Disney films that use this process which is strange that there are so few because Disney pioneered it. Disney pretty much invented it with the early 'Alice' comedies which were earlier than the Fleischer 'KoKo' cartoons. and aside from 'Space Jam' and 'Bullwinkle', it's almost never done by anyone else.that's why 'Roger Rabbit' is such a interesting, and in my opinion, a truly pioneering Hollywood classic and a film that makes more contributions to cinema then it's usually given credit for.not to mention the brilliant performances which actually rival the astonishing technical aspect of the film. Bob Hoskins is incredible in this and should have been nominated for a Oscar. he probably should have won. Christopher Lloyd is terrifying and brilliantly villainous. in fact Lloyd's Judge is probably one of cinema's weirdest and scariest villains ever conceived. not much to say about Joanna Cassidy here except that she is one of those truly rare actresses who can absolutely do no wrong. like Hoskins and Lloyd, she is outstanding and wonderfully inspired in this and actually has one of the film's best lines, 'is he always this funny? or only on days when he's wanted for murder?'. let's also not forget the sheer hilarity of Charles Fleischer's Roger. not only is Fleischer's Roger one of the best voices in cartoon history, it is also one of the very best performances of our recent times. Fleischer's Roger is both deftly comical and endearingly lovable. Roger's neurosis and insecure behavior are very human and very relatable.this film is also very Disney. sure it was produced by Disney's Touchstone division and it featured many Warner Bros. character's as well as just about every nostalgic cartoon character from the golden age of cartoons. but it was animated mostly by Disney animators, and any film that has an appearance by Mickey Mouse and Tinkerbell, is pretty much a Disney experience since those character's never appear outside of Disney films and shows.this film also has Mickey Mouse and Bugsy Bunny appearing together for the first and only time. Mick and B.Bunny's screen time together is very brief probably because they were basically rivals. Mickey was always rather amiable and pleasant toward the Bunny, but Bugs was always rather critical and scornful of the congenial modest mouse. i always felt that the Bunny was secretly jealous of the mouse's sense of compassion and social abilities. i admire the Bunny very much as a comedian, but let's be realistic and honest, the Bunny is really a asocial personality type.'Roger rabbit' is one of my very favorite cinema fantasies. truly magical and inspired and a great technical achievement. for those people that don't really get Disney classics or 'Roger Rabbit', and still don't know the 'password', maybe you should watch the film again, learn the password, think about it, and maybe then you might just understand and change your mind. this is a classic for true devotees.",10,1,1,18 February 2011
Finding Neverland," Beautifully Done. Remarkable And Resonant Entertainment.
","'if you find any little bit of happiness in the world, people try to crush it', says James M. Barrie with a deep intensity. such is the stuff of Marc Forster's beautifully conceived and executed work of profoundly deep emotions, 'Finding Neverland'. it's a good old fashioned emotional tear jerker without being corny or mushy about anything. like Tim Burton's emotional and moving 'Big Fish', i still cry every time i see this. the fact that i've experienced the death of a close, loved one, makes this film feel very real and insightful.as a long time fan of JMB, i can also appreciate how reverent and sensitive this is to his legendary children's masterpiece. sure there is some embellishment of history, and Johnny Depp's JMB is more dashing and charming then the real JMB who was somewhat stuffy and proper, but this film very effectively conveys the true essence and purpose of JMB's famous fairy world. 'Neverland' becomes a beautiful metaphor for the threshold of death. i'm not sure that's exactly what JMB meant to say, but Peter Pan always did say, 'to die would be an awfully big adventure'. except of course, in the Disney version which left that dialog out in order to 'disneyize' the whole thing.the understanding of Victorian/Edwardian England and it's prudish observance of conventionalities and mores of that time period is deeply insightful and basically historically accurate. in fact it's probably a more accurate depiction of England at that time then a hundred percent accurate telling of JMB's exploits. however, the accusation made about Barrie's interest in the children was very real and very unfortunate.there is one very revealing moment about the stuffiness of the period when JMB and his wife retire to sleep. not only do they have separate beds, they have separate bedrooms. revealing of the period and the deterioration of their marriage.the performances here are beyond reproach. it's hard to think of any recent film within the last decade where the performances are this good, this real, and this deeply felt. everyone in this is just so perfect. even though Depp is far too handsome to be JMB, he brings so much depth and refinement to this role you can't find him any fault. Kate Winslet is incredible here and equals Depp's performance with every frame and scene without overshadowing the importance of his performance. Winslet does the whole 'Dark Victory' bit without any trace of maudlin mawkishness. in fact, dying has never seemed so beautiful in film as her acting makes this. Julie Christie gives a performance worthy of more recognition then it received. and she should have won an Oscar for this. Freddie Highmore gives his usual first rate delivery. Highmore was definitely one of the best child actors of the decade. the always fascinating Toby Jones also does a delightful bit as 'Smee'.the film direction and editing here are refined and perfect. Marc Forster aptly depicts the austerity of the time period as well as some beautifully conceived and brief fantasy flights. the flights of fantasy here are reminiscent of Peter Jackson's brilliant 'Heavenly Creatures', a film which also starred Winslet.very few films have got away with the whole tear jerking emotionalism of the 'dying young' drama. Julia Roberts couldn't pull it off. this kind of thing is usually botched and badly. that is why it is such a surprise that this film not only handles it's emotional sentimentalism well, it is great and effective cinema and wonderfully memorable entertainment.",9,2,2,31 January 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino Is A Bastard
","Quentin Tarantino is a bastard. but a lovable one. that's why his films are so tough and so much fun. I don't go out to the movies very often, i usually just opt to stay home and see the new films on DVD. if i even bother to check out the new movies at all. Tarantino usually gets me to the Theater. 'Basterds' and 'Grindhouse' were two of the few movies I went to the theaters to see in recent years.I wasn't disappointed. Brad Pitt was great. he should have been nominated for an Oscar as far as i'm concerned. like all of Tarantino's recent films, this was stylish and lots of fun. sure it wasn't a serious classic like 'Reservoir Dogs' 'Pulp' or 'Jackie Brown', but it was really good Hollywood entertainment. the kind we've come to expect from QT. QT might be a bastard, but he's a talented one.",8,0,4,2 March 2010
Seven Years in Tibet," The PITTfall Of being Too Political
","i did'nt rate this for a very good reason. i don't like to get involved in anything i find that is too political. i despise politics. there is a famous Quote that says 'politics is madness'. i agree.H.G. Wells once wrote a famous essay disapproving of nationalism and it's consequence. he also was suspicious of airplanes, so i don't know. all i know is that while i deeply love America, i don't like nationalism from anywhere. i don't care what country you are from. people are people. a good Christian looks beyond these things.this movie is basically all about the 'free Tibet' movement. i'm okay with that. everyone has a right to their opinion and to express it freely. i encourage opinions. like assholes, everyone should have one. as far as an opinion on this subject? i don't really have one. i don't know enough about the whole mess to make one. so i choose to stay out of this one.i don't hate the Chinese, i don't hate Tibet. i don't even really hate German Nazis, although i am wary of that one. i try to understand the babble that all of you are trying to tell me but i just don't, or want to get it. as far as i'm concerned everyone is acting like potential H-bombs these days and i want nothing to do with it. at this point, to me, the human race is nothing but trouble.this is a propaganda film for the 'free Tibet' movement. i'm okay with that too. i've seen many propaganda movies like 'Triumph of the Will' and so on, so this doesn't phase me. but be aware that this is a propaganda film and know what you are supporting and getting into. as Davy Crockett once said, 'be sure you're right and then you go ahead'.everybody should go do whatcha like. dream your dreams and make your wishes. wishes can come true. just make sure the dream you dream and the wish you make is what you want. it may not be. be careful what you wish for you could be wishing up a monster. that's sometimes cool too. monstrous wishes just make this whole thing kind of funny. look everyone, it feels real, looks real, but it is not. you are all dreaming all of this. your true self is in another world than this. you can choose to wake up or not. that's not important. i caution very strongly against becoming too awake. it can often feel rude and difficult. i promise you.all of this is not real. so keep dreaming and wishing, but remember, every move you make, every step you take, every breath you make,God is watching you. he knows everything about you. so does the Devil. if you are half way smart about this you will heed this warning.i have nothing to lose here. i have no family or future generations. so i don't give a Damn if it all blows tomorrow. something is connecting us all to one dream. so the dreams you make can effect others. it's here. i'm not being silly or all that paranoid. it's here and it's a period of judgment. i suggest you try to do God's will, but if you can't, be careful with your dream. they are watching. i am nothing like any of you, so remember i am watching too. God bless and good luck with your journey.",Null,1,2,29 July 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Pop Disney, Pop Culture, Pop History.
","i didn't rate this. for one thing i did'nt think it would be fair to rate it since i do not have a theater system to do a movie like this much justice. i only have a 30' TV screen and it is not HD or flat screen. i also only have DVD and not Blu-ray. i do have surround sound though. the sound was great. but i'm sure if i had all the other upgrades i would have felt differently about this film.as it was, i thought it was pretty dull going. the Disney 'Pirate' movies are big screen movies but they are quirky and funnier than this so there are other things to enjoy on a smaller screen. this pretty much needs a big screen to get the full effect.there wan't much in this to offend anybody(always a good idea for Disney films), it was pretty much aimed at tweens, mostly boys, and was relatively harmless. it pretty much seemed like a lot of pop history and not terribly realistic. although it's not going to fry the brains of kids the way junk like the 'Elizabeth' movies, with Cate Blanchett, most certainly will.i thought the cheapo historical dramas Disney made in the past like 'Sword and the Rose' or 'Kidnapped', were probably better history and a little more worthwhile than this snoozer.",Null,0,1,16 September 2010
Ed Wood," Truly Epitomizes The Art Of Filmmaking
","i've always felt that Tim Burton's classic 'Ed Wood' was all about Hollywood and more important about the heart and mind of the filmmaker and artist. his film 'Edward ScissorsHands' was about the artist in general, but 'Ed Wood' is about the artist as a cinema artist and filmmaker in particular.sure Ed Wood jr. might have been pretty bizarre, but he obviously loved to make movies, was sincere about it and most of all, he's not boring. bad films are boring. Eddie's movies are always so weird and kooky and quaint that they stand out from other bad films and from other films in general. you really remember them.there has been a lot of quibbling about the accuracy in Tim Burton's movie about EWJ's life accounts. i own and have read Rudolph Grey's book (i bought it for my brother in 1992 and read it before the movie came out), and i would have to say a good percentage of Burton's film is fairly accurate. sure 'Plan 9' never premiered at the Pantages theater in Hollywood, and Wood never met Orson Welles (who incidentally was much older at this time period than depicted here). but some even weirder things, like the Baptist church involvement and Vampira's taking the city bus to the filming in full costume, were absolutely true. Burton did take liberties with the truth here but i would say there is more truth than fiction here which brings to mind the old adage about the truth being stranger than fiction.whatever the case, this film glorifies not only Hollywood, but the independent filmmaker and THAT is true democracy. i wish more people were truly that fair and democratic when evaluating things in our society. we actually might get somewhere if people practiced more thinking like this.this is one of Hollywood's greatest classics. certainly one of it's funniest. all the elements here work well and go beyond the call. the performances are just great, especially Landau, who in my opinion gives one of the very best performances in the history of the Academy Awards. the whole film in general is just brilliant.so many lines in the movie sum the whole like Criswell stating 'can your heart stand the terrifying TRUTH...', but sometimes i think it's the dialogue between Weiss and Wood where Weiss yells, 'i asked you for a sex change film and you give me some crap about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters!', to where Wood replies, 'i don't happen to think he's a schmuck'. oh well. time alone and time will tell.",10,1,1,25 October 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Normally Not my kind Of Thing, But A Good Premise And I Enjoyed It
","on a whole i'm not all that enthusiastic about CGI photography, especially in animated movies. i think that the emphasis on reality and live action squeezes the spontaneity out of the characterizations and backgrounds. i happen to like the painted, impressionist quality of the backgrounds in traditional hand drawn animation. however i did like this movie and found it involving. it was very similar to 'Polar Express' for me, liked the film but didn't warm to the process.personally i think Disney and the amazing Pixar do this better. Disney and Pixar give their CGI animated films a true characterized and stylized look that hand drawn animated films embody. 'Polar' and 'Tin Tin' lack the animated expressionism that say a 'Cars' or the incredible ' The Incredibles' has.i did like 'Tin Tin' surprisingly despite it's short comings as a animated feature. i've read the 'Tin Tin' comics and would have to say this is a more than adequate adaptation. it also had a lot of charm and well done action adventure. the main character of Tin Tin and his doggie Snowy were also well conceived with Tin Tin himself being very adventurous and intriguing. the overall story was fairly involving as well.all in all, not a great film and not as arresting a ground breaker in photography as you would think, but it was a good kid's flick and had a lot to offer in terms of conception and storyline.for me CGI doesn't quite cut it over traditional hand drawing, so on the whole, i still prefer sticking to what's tried and true to the form, Disney's 'Dumbo' or 'Fantasia'.",7,1,1,22 August 2012
The Expendables," Zzzzzzzz. Boring. I Only Watched This Because of Statham And LI.
","i only watched this to see Jason Statham and Jet Li. even those two incredible performers couldn't save this uninspired flatness.i suppose i might have liked and appreciated this if i was 12 yrs old and watching it with my dad. the best thing i can say about this is that it's alright for kids and is more appropriate for a father and son viewing than a lot of action flicks. Robert Rodgriguez action movies are waaaay better, but i probably would be uncomfortable letting a young kid watch a lot of the 'carnage asada' of Rodgriguez's early action flicks.aside from some fairly tame violence, this is just fine for kids. and their parents will probably be more comfortable with this then a Quentin Tarantino flick. it's also a good excuse to see Statham and Li who were the best things about this 'wholesome' bore.as for Sylvester 'the cat' Stallone? pretty boring as usual. Stallone was best in the original 'Death Race 2000'. he was even better in the 'gay' porno film he made, 'The Italian Stallion'.i might of liked this flick if i was still a stupid baby.",6,4,9,25 March 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Capitalism A Love Story. Michael Moore's Got Nothing On This One.
","funny. another name for this could be 'Capitalism a love story', because that's pretty much what this is about. it's a grim and morbid, but ultimately hilarious, satirical send up of the almighty dollar(or pound note). anything to make your business turn around and become a financial success. profits over humanity. funny funny funny.aside from making a almost profound statement about humanity, this is also one of Hollywood's greatest entertainments and one of it's finest musicals. i love Sondheim's 'Night Music' and 'Company', and i hear his score for Alain Resnais 'Stavisky' is nothing less than brilliant. but this is the score i love the most because of it's wicked and subtle wit. not to mention great beauty.Johhny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are truly memorable and brilliant here. these are two of the most memorable performances i've almost ever seen. there is so much power here. Alan Rickman is frightening as the evil judge. and Sascha Baron Cohen and the marvelous Timonthy Spall make up a (ha ha) delicious supporting cast. these dark, over powering performances are nicely contrasted with the cherub-like innocence of the children in this. Jamie Bower, Jane Wisener, and Eddie Sanders, seem like waifish, angelic babes in a 'innocence lost' scenario that is deeply moving and heart-breaking. a horrifying statement about the terrors and corruption that befall children in this world.as a matter of fact, this movie is probably okay for children to see. but absolutely not without adult supervision. it wholly deserves it's 'R' rating for some of the most graphic violence i've ever seen in a movie. the numerous throat slashings are ghastly and horrific and should not be seen by kids. but that's the dilemma the adult parent faces in their decision. this film has a deep statement to make about childhood and half of it's protagonist are children. there is also very little profanity and sex is only suggested. it is also such well conceived culture a kid can only become more sophisticated because of it. but parents should be warned that much of this is inappropriate for kids. not only is it too violent, but it features a gin guzzling ten year old.this is a profound and amazing cinema experience. despite it's dark negativity, the viewer can only grow from it. it's truly one of cinema's very, best musicals. it's 'R' rating isn't wrong it's just a paradox of sorts. it's unsuitable but yet for all audiences. that doesn't seem to make sense but it's true.",10,0,0,13 December 2010
Shutter Island," Awesome! Scared The Hell Out Of Me
","this was scary as all hell. this has got to be the first Scorsese film that can be labeled a horror film. it was definitely one of the scariest things i've seen since Kubrick's 'The Shining'. i scare pretty easily but i still love horror flicks, but most horror flicks are based a lot on menaces that are not plausible. like Kubrick's 'Shining' the scares here feel very real and...well let's hope not, somewhat plausibleScorsese is one of those rare Hollywood directors who can always justify a large budget and big film making. when a film is this good it's hard to quibble about how it came into being. the obviously large budget provides this film with a glossy, slick look to it and near perfect professionalism in all categories. the script is excellent and the acting, from everyone in the cast down to the bit players as nurses and guards, are outstanding.this film actually gave me a nightmare the night i watched it. the ending of the film will probably give us all nightmares for the rest of our lives. i've never seen so many horrifying images of cadavers and torment and death since Ken Russell's shock fest 'The Devils'. one shock moment in particular had me reeling. but i won't spoil it and tell.this is first class Hollywood story telling. even though it incorporates all the latest technology of cinema, and is excessively gory, it looks and feels like a Hollywood classic from the 30's or 40's. it was even better than Hitchcock's film classic 'Spellbound'(one of Hitch's more overrated classics)at the end the story might feel somewhat obvious and predictable to some, but getting there is most of the fun. and it still leaves it up to the audience to solve it for themselves. what happened? why is the 67th patient there? you decide. pure story telling genius. and i hate to over trumpet things.",9,1,3,15 June 2010
Tangled," Pure Disney. One Of Their Very Best CGI Animated Films To Date.
","wow. i really thought this was a lot of fun. it was also pure Disney. the CGI animated films released directly by Disney (Meet The Robinsons, Chicken Little),often feel more like authentic Disney than the Pixar/Disney collaborations.not that the Pixar films aren't the best in the field of CGI animation, and do utilize a totally Disney approach, but there is always a underlying element of collaboration that often feels as much Pixar as Disney. unlike Buena Vista distribution which was established by Disney himself in the 1950's after he left RKO, Pixar was a independent production facility that originally had nothing to do with Disney.i also happen to feel that fairy tales are often what Disney does best. i love fairy tales. so i guess this had more appeal to me and felt more like the Disney classics i grew up with. the animation in Pixar/Disney films is more elaborate and accomplished, but this had more of the 'Disney' heart to it. 'Finding Nemo' and 'Cars' were excellent films and had better, more proficient animation, but in some ways i enjoyed this film even more.'Tangled' is also a little more psychologically deeper than the usual Pixar films. 'Tangled' might very well be Disney's most psychologically complex film next to their film 'Enchanted'. i've always felt that 'Enchanted' has some of the most complicated and revealing psychology of any Disney film including Disney's golden age of classics. 'Enchanted' kind of works as couch therapy for Disney fans brought up on fairly simplistic, straight forward happy ending philosophies. 'Tangled' might not be as philosophical about the whole fairy tale happy ending thing, but the psychology of the witch/step mother, is pretty intense. the step mother tries to control the girl with fear and manipulation. something our current society often thrives on.i'm not saying that every time a adult enforces authority on a child is unjustified, but this certainly gives the viewer something to think about. the only problem here is that it does sort of make 'alternative' parenting look bad.still, there are little or no flaws here. it's pretty much perfect and perfectly delectable family fare. teen age girls especially will probably eat it up and hang on every word. don't see why not. even though 'Tangled' is for all audience members, it's primary appeal will be mostly for teen age girls and young women.if you are a true Disney fan, and one that loves the 'princess' fairy tale movies like i do, you'll get a real kick out of this winner. i suggest that even if you are not a die hard Disney fan, you let your hair down, sit back, and just dig this sugary, Disney treat.",9,2,5,20 March 2011

","every time i see 'Grease' i'm always disturbed by it somewhat. where there are certain bad movies that are unintentionally funny and humorous, 'Grease' manages to be unintentionally kind of shocking and crude, and a little offensive.i mean jeez. you would think that John Water's, who directed one of the most offensive films of all time which was the infamous 'Pink Flamingos', would have made the more shocking film with 'Hairspray'. not so, Water's 'Hairspray' is far more thoughtful, intelligent and morally correct than the simple minded decadence of 'Grease'.and it's a little disturbing that a family film like 'Grease' is unaware of it sleaziness. i mean John Travolta turns down Stockard Channing's advancements by saying he 'doesn't like sloppy seconds'. omg that's a porn term. also the 'Sandra Dee' spoof goes beyond simple ribald teasing into hardcore cynicism and reckless promiscuity. i'm not sure kids should be exposed to that. this film also encourages smoking and drinking by juveniles.i suppose the juvenile recklessness would be even more questionable if any of these actors even looked like they were in high school. i mean Stockard Channing as a high school senior is really stretching it. all the actors here look like they are pushing the big 3-0. at least in John Water's original 'Hairspray' movie the kids were between sixteen and eighteen which was far more believable. i mean 'Grease' gives a 'double entendre' to saying 'high school seniors'.also the musical numbers often look like adolescent 'jiffy pop' versions of Busby Berkley musicals. the musical number 'Beauty School Drop Out' with Frankie Avalon also comes off as a little scary and weird.do i like this messy, musical mayhem movie? well actually yes. i think 'Grease' is a lot of hokey, cheesy fun. if not a little raw around the edges. but it's vulgar, crudity is part of why 'Grease' is amusing.mostly the day is saved by a couple of things. first of all John Travolta and Olivia Newton John are tremendous here. two of the most captivating musical performers ever photographed in Hollywood film. i mean you can't stop watching both of them because of their strong natural talent and presence. second, 'Grease' is a mediocre stage play and musical, it could not have been brought off with out the self assured compentency of director Randall Kleiser. Randall Kleiser was one of Hollywood's best 'stock' directors and he always knows what he's doing with a film. Kleiser has a good sense of focus and more than likely this film would have seemed rambling and pointless without him.with Travolta, Newton-John, and director Randall Kleiser aboard, this ride works out to be smooth and winning success. despite a little wear and tear on the shock absorbers. i didn't particularly like 'Grease' when it first came out. i thought it was kind of stupid and corny. but it was a youth phenomenon and a smash hit with my generation, and for some reason i ended up going back to the movies three times to see it (mostly dragged there by other kids). as the years progress i find i like musicals better and appreciate what a sensation 'Grease' was.one more note on this film's morals. particularly the ending. if you are a young person and you get hooked up with this monster musical movie, i wouldn't take this film's advice and go changing yourself to appease the opposite sex. especially some good for nothing greaser boy. i hardly doubt becoming a trashy tart will improve your sex life. with that said have fun. 'Grease' is all about fun. just remember that smoking can be hazardous to your health as well as other kinds of behaviour.",8,0,1,12 July 2012
Footloose," Classic 80's Teen Flick
","i love 'Footloose'. i wasn't exactly a high school kid when it came out, but i was still young and Innocent enough to really appreciate it. like so many from that generation.there were a lot of films like this, with music, and aimed at a young audience, and like most other young people back then, i saw 'em all with very little critical judgment. but now that i'm older (much older), i have a tendency to analyze this kind of thing more. especially as a lot of these films that were once new have become retro.i liked most of these films but they could be somewhat problematic at times. 'Saturday Night Fever' was a classic, but it could be too realistic and dreary in it's approach, and the storyline is kind of non-existent and a little pointless. i loved 'Flashdance' and the original 'Fame' movie, but those films, as good as they are, can be strangely cold and detached and make the viewer feel like a spectator, rather than a involved participant. 'Xanadu' is peachy, cute and adorable, but it 's just that, it's for babies. i mean what can you say about a movie where the 'big' love scene is done with cutesy cartoon animals. i like 'Grease' a lot, but let's face it, that's a pretty silly and brain dead experience. fun though.'Footloose' was one of the only ones that hit some kind of note of perfection. it is sweet without being corny. musical without being too over done. and it makes a strong message without being horribly preachy and a heavy-handed bore. everything in 'Footloose' clicks and works successfully.this is a fun, enjoyable film without driving anything into the ground or home too hard.that's rare. also, despite under-age drinking, tobacco usage and mention of pre-marital sex, it's a good coming of age film and not too intense for teens who are weary of too many racy values and notions often injected into teen entertainment.not to mention Kevin Bacon and Chris Penn are really good here. Chris Penn is actually very sexy and good looking here, it's hard to believe he became the bloated monster thing he was in later years. Penn remained a good actor, but compared with his youthful, sexy image here, he definitely became a trollish monster in comparison.fun film with a strong Christian base. a teen classic.",8,3,5,10 April 2011
Dreamgirls," Eddie Murphy Was Gypped!
","when the award for best supporting actor was announced at the 2006 academy award show, it was rumored that actor Eddie Murphy was so offended he walked out. he was severely criticized for it, but when you weigh his performance against the winner, Alan Arkin, i really can't say i blame him in the least.Alan Arkin was given the award as a sympathy award because of his age and seniority in the industry, not for the merit of his performance. even more unfair and insulting, Arkin's performance in 'Little Miss Sunshine' was minuscule and literally(ha ha), very short lived on screen. not only was Arkin's role too small and not of much consequence, it simply doesn't compare with Murphy's energetic and mesmerizing portrayal of Jimmy 'thunder' Early, 'Dreamgirls' ill fated Motown celebrity.Eddie Murphy sizzles with raw magnetism and musical virtuoso in one of the decades most memorable and powerful performances. Alan Arkin's sweetly deft performance as the little girl's doddering grandfather in 'Sunshine', was really no comparison and not even in the same class. i suppose it was nice to see the over-the-hill Arkin receive an award after all those years, but Arkin has been acknowledged with nominations before, and i doubt Eddie Murphy will ever find another role like this that showcases his numerous, considerable,talents. shame. the academy awards blew it and missed an important opportunity. i guess the pros don't always know what they're doing.fortunately they knew what they were doing with Jennifer's Hudson amazing acting debut as the much beleaguered character, Effie. Hudson is nothing less than astonishing. it's hard to conceive that she is new to acting in major productions, because she takes to acting like a fish-in-water. Effie is a major role in 'Dreamgirls', with lots of singing and emotional requirements. Hudson manages both singing and acting exceptionally. her rendition of 'I'm Not leaving', is a awe inspiring mix of acting and singing. when Simon Cowell told Hudson she wouldn't go anywhere, he must have been out of his mind. along with Eddie Murphy, Hudson gives one of the decade's very best and most memorable performances.i don't want to ignore the performance by pop star Beyonce either. she's just great and a even match for the enormously over powering charisma of Murphy and Hudson. Beyonce makes the transition from music video star to handling a major film role, smoothly and effortlessly.there are also notable and memorable performances from 'Frog Prince' princess Tiana, Anika Noni Rose, and Jamie Foxx from the excellent drama 'Ray'.'Dreamgirls' is also a good film and good cinema. it never sacrifices it's sense of filmmaking for Broadway musical contrivances. it also handles it strong emotions without ever being sappy, maudlin, or overly sentimental. considering the amount of highly charged emotions that pervade the story, it is all done with a certain matter of fact dryness and with dignity. the characters never seem whiny, pathetic or undignified. in fact they seem like people who are struggling to keep their dignity intact.of course the music is tuneful and catchy and out of this world. the scene where 'white' singers do a very 'souless' cover of the 'black' 'Cadillac Car', is a little exaggerated, but hilariously well deserved.the very idea that Eddie Murphy lost out to the geriatric Arkin will probably always steam me and be one of the reasons i now pay very little attention to the Oscar shows. 'Dreamgirls' is a powerful film with mesmerizing performances and deep statements about race and the media. 'Little Miss sunshine' was basically nothing more than a communist manifesto for seven year olds.",9,3,5,6 January 2011
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The Barney Shuffle
","They say the U.S. Government tortured Iraqi prisoners by making them listen to the 'Barney' theme song. Funny. I used to stay up late at night watching 'Barney' videos on my VCR that I recorded earlier in the day. I was able to do that a lot of nights for a couple of years, so what drives one person nuts....But then again I was totally stoned and sometimes on Acid and Shrooming so maybe that gave me some kind of immunity or something.This was a really cool film. and really funny. George Clooney,a.k.a The Fantastic Mr.Fox,has flicked his bushy tail once more and given another really good performance in another really good movie.I didn't think this movie was as good as 'Burn After Reading',but it showed a lot of Coen bros. influence in it. and it was almost as good. Maybe even a little funnier because it was weirder. Did the Army really think you could kill a goat by staring at it? Jeez.Thought they were stupid, but....",8,4,6,15 April 2010
No Strings Attached," Superficial, Shallow, Innocuous, Assessment Of Love And Relationships. But It's Kinda Cute And Not Without Some Merit.
","i usually don't watch stuff like this. do chicks watch stuff like this? who watches stuff like this? i dunno but i'm in a relationship with someone who adores Ashton Kutcher, so to be nice i watched this. can't say i was real impressed except for the fact that it was a little more likable than i expected it to be.normally i'd say i'm the wrong person to review a movie like this, it's really not my kind of thing, but i told myself that i would commit myself to writing on every movie i watched no matter how old or innocuous it may be. it's a therapy thing. but i'm at a loss for words when things get this unimportant and superficial. here it goes.Ivan Reitman directed this? really. he's obviously getting old. 'Stripes' is one of my favorite comedies of all time and i find it hard to fathom someone who directed a movie with such kick to it directed a light weight marshmallow like this.i tried hard to pay attention to the storyline at the expense of my brain turning into mushy drivel. the pay off wasn't half bad. it actually had a little something to say and wasn't without a certain amount of self reflection. mostly i don't like the kind of people that this film was peopled with, but i tried not to be too judgmental. live and let live i always say. sure these people were all smug, egomanical jerks, but they seemed to be struggling a little with their existence and seemed willing to ask some questions about themselves and things. that's all i've ever asked from people, show a little reflection and insight into what you do and what motivates your behavior. i mean you're not animals right? right? at least i hope not. mostly in real life people practice very little self criticism or reflection about anything. most people are all action and no thought.this film was pretty typical of most Hollywood garbage. it makes sex look easy and all you have to do is want to have sex and it shall come. whoa. my brains fall out just thinking about the silliness of that notion. it also, as usual, attempts to paint a cheery portrayal of gay life. another stupid notion. yeah right. all gay people sit around watching 'Glee' or lying on the floor having pseudo menstrual cramps with the girls. and no matter how overweight or homely you are you can always score with a really cute guy easily. whoever wrote that crap must either be straight or seriously deluded. STOP WITH THE WHITEWASHING Hollywood! it doesn't wash with a lot of us.also the rapper Ludicrous was a total joke here. does he really want to act so bad that he is willing to sell out and be the one token black face in a film that is a sea of white faces. there really were little or no black people in this film. not even the film extras. typical Hollywood. good to be conscious of your sexuality but not about your racism. shame on Ivan Reitman.love and relationships are just about the most difficult thing you will do in life. even casual sex probably doesn't come all that easily, but i wouldn't know anything about that.this movie makes having sex and love look so easy. a deluded, silly and shallow notion of things. love hurts whether it is right or wrong.at least the idiots that this movie was about attempted some reflection on their mindlessly one track behavior. but the list of wrongs here is a little too long for my taste. especially when Natalie Portman's ugly 'grenade' of a best girlfriend informs her that if she continues to be depressed or a downer she will 'seriously have to avoid her in the hallway'. typical of current insensitivity which is so trendy and popular. especially with ugly, fat, 'grenade', ethnic girls. that didn't sound nice did it? well neither was the girl's behavior. Hollywood is pretty messed up. had to prove a point.as for Ashton and dumb little Natalie Portman? well neither one has ever impressed me much, but they are both likable enough presences and did well to help tolerate this trivia. they can definitely act and are affable enough to radiate a certain amount of warmth and sweetness. as a matter of fact Kutcher and Portman sum up the whole experience here, the film like the two actors, is kinda cute.",7,1,5,26 July 2011
Enchanted," Traditional Disney Entertainment With A Psychological Spin On It.
","As a devoted, long time Disney fan, I really feel that this is probably the best live-action product the studio has made since major production from the original Burbank studio ended. It embodies so much of what Disney films should be like, only with a little couch therapy added for thought.I've always loved Disney, but let's be realistic. Happiness is a very difficult path to take. Just look at what characters like Pinocchio, Dumbo, or Snow White went through to get there. As a avid Disney fan I have many times had to reconcile the Disney 'happy ending' philosophy with the numerous soul crushing disappointments that life often deals some of us. Often the only true happiness I have found is mostly in the Disney films themselves. Real life can be impossible, heart-breaking, even dangerous, and decidedly full of lots of lies and untruths. This film is perfect tonic for anyone who was raised believing in a 'happy ending' for themselves and finds life to be, well, rather hard. This film analyzes the 'happy' concept, turns it every which way, and sincerely tries to help understand what 'happiness' means in the real world.The real world in the film is New York city, our time, our world, a world that the evil Queen in the film describes as 'a place where there are NO happy endings'. Ouch. In our world the vermin aren't cute, they're a little un-nerving and a little disgusting. People don't just burst into joyous song(or do they?). And happy endings take some awareness and self insight.Any generation of Disney fans that doesn't embrace this film is asking for trouble. I promise you. It helps Disney fans understand themselves and come to better terms with Disney vs. the real world. It will put everything in proper perspective. I should know.'Happy endings' can be elusive for some. But you should try to believe, if not for yourself, for others. But be careful not to be blinded, and be careful that your happiness doesn't infringe on others too much. God Bless. Good luck.",9,0,0,19 April 2010
Mamma Mia!," I Was Converted From ABBA Hater To ABBA Fan.
","When I was younger I hated ABBA. Even the mention of the song 'Dancing Queen' made me want to puke and feel embarrassed for it's fans. I preferred hard rock like 'Sabbath' or the 'Stones'. I simply couldn't stand most pop and disco.Now that I'm all grown up(another way of saying 'old')I must have mellowed or something because now I love ABBA. If you had told me twenty, even ten years ago, that one day I would be an ABBA fan I would have said that wasn't possible. No way. Well it was possible and now I own the movie and an ABBA video collection. NEVER thought that would happen.I only went to see this movie because of Streep and that I've developed a taste for movie musicals as I got older. Even though I like musicals now, I still thought this would suck and stink and make me puke. Instead I was hooked from the first song and I couldn't stop laughing at how funny the movie was.Now that I look back, I see the threads of my acceptance in the making. Before I was into hard rock and the stuff like the 'Dead', I bought Osmond brothers records and liked the Partridge Family. So I can kind of see how this happened.I recommend this movie as simple easy going fun for everybody. I do not endorse, however, the heavy alcohol consumption in the film. I mean these woman drink like they're W.C. Fields. Alcohol can be fun for adults, but if not done in moderation it can be a killer. So have fun with this. Just don't drink your brains(or bladder)into oblivion.",9,1,2,11 June 2010
Liar Liar," Charming Family Comedy With Lots Of Heart.
","this really is a charming film that really wins you over. it combines good solid direction, good screen writing with outrageous physical comedy. it also has very good insights into the human psyche and valuable lessons about the truth and responsibility toward humankind.Jim Carrey is nothing short of amazing. he combines true actors insights and emotional depth with strenuous physical acrobatics that probably would have killed any other actor. his performance is a true throwback to the golden age of comedy. a true genius and a master of form.when is Jim Carrey going to get an Oscar nomination? i know he's been nominated for numerous other awards, but a 'Kid's Choice' award is hardly the same thing as an Oscar. Carrey has proved himself time and again many times and should be taken more seriously as an actor. i can't honestly say i liked 'Dumber' or 'Ace', but movies like 'Eternal Sunshine', 'Truman', 'Man in the Moon' and 'Series of Unfotunate Events', are certainly Oscar worthy. he most definitely should have been nominated for 'Liar'. i checked the other nominees that year and his performance was better than more than a few of them. is it because Carrey is a comedian who specializes in over the top humor and slapstick? just because a man is loved by little children doesn't mean you shouldn't take him seriously.'Liar Liar' is a charming film and should be revisited by those who don't take it seriously. it has a message with heart and is a minor classic among recent films.",8,0,1,27 March 2010
The Transporter," A Fun Diversion. Not Much More.
","i liked it. it took me a long time to finally watch one of these films (how many are there again?), but it was better than i expected.i can't say i just love Luc Besson. i find him interesting but that's about it. i can't say i relate to a movie based on what? some BMW promo series on the internet? you gotta be kidding. how (no pun) commercial.actually this film seemed loosely based on Walter Hill's film 'The Driver' which was much deeper and a better film. this film was just more cranked up and testosterone charged. that doesn't always make a better film. Walter Hill's film has a better script, is more reflective and is a good example of contemporary (contemporary enough, that was the 80's) film noir.in defense of 'Transporter' i will say this. it wasn't Michael Bay, and at least in this first film (haven't seen the others), it used real stunts and not a lot of CGI stunts. i miss the old days when a stunt or an explosion was done for real and not just done with CGI (even when it's state of the art you can always tell it's CGI). it was to the 'Transporter's' credit that they actually staged pretty much all the stunts unlike 'Transformers' which had a lot of the action inter-spliced with CGI effects.i didn't think the plot was so bad or nonexistent, it was just kind of simple. but it had a good message about not treating human beings like slaves or commodities. it was solidly directed if not a little too 'busy', and the actors were likable and sexy and, let's face it, Jason Statham is outrageous to watch in action. a sort of European Bruce Lee.not gonna make any attempt to say this was great cinema or anything, but it was entertaining, pretty much did what it professed to do, and it probably should be treated with a little bit more respect than it seems to have gotten from critics and audiences.",7,1,1,26 June 2010
1941," Explosively Funny
","i really don't know what to say about war movies much. mostly i hate war, mostly. but i'm fascinated by it because i'm fascinated by history and war is often a important part of history. but i'm against war, and i'm not even sure our so called 'good' wars, aren't just a bunch of gut reactions by a whole lot of insane and stupid people driven mad with power.i always thought this movie was pretty funny. much of it is overdone in to overkill, and it eventually doesn't warrant the expense and hullabaloo of it's humungo budget because of it's persistently low brow humour and irreverent silliness. but i have to admit it's pretty damn funny and it actually seems funnier now than it did some thirty something years ago. like the John Landis comedy spectacle, 'The Blues Bros. Movie', they just don't make em quite like this anymore. especially when they totaled a real house in Pacific Pallisades at the end.i suppose it also helps to like dumb humour on a 'Three Stooges Level'. there is lots of wacko antics here and a basic conviction that basically all people are hopeless idiots and pretty much deserve to be 'hoisted by their own petards'.strangely even though this movie doesn't seem to be big on much commentary except that war is funny. a dubious observation if any. but it does have somewhat of a anti-war statement. hey it even features a hilarious Slim Pickens from 'The Dr. Strangelove' comedy. it also makes a good statement that comes from Dan Ackroyd when he states that 'it sickens me to see Americans fighting other Americans' when he observes a pointless 'zoot suit' riot.much of the humour is done for goofy laughs mostly. like a the volunteer citizen on top of a ferris wheel doing night watch with a obnoxious, idiot kid with a ventriloquist dummy. or like the housewife who knocks on the window of her kitchen as her nit wit, half blind husband almost shoots a missle launcher at the house.a lot of the humour can also be kind of scary and unsympathetic with people. i doubt it's strange detachment to war comes from it's screen writer John Milius, who was known for extreme jingoistic right wing values as in his screenplay for 'Red Dawn'. but this film seems strangely hostile to it's protagonist and their feverent patriotism. at times it almost seems too hate them in a scathing way as it sneers at their folly and lunacy. this movie even makes funny light of a rape attempt on the teenage girl by Treat Williams Army officer. it also seems to think old, fashioned southern racism is funny. which it kind of is.for me personally, the high point of the film was when Gen. Stillwell, who was a real person, ignores the outside events as he sits in a movie theatre happily watching Disney's 'Dumbo', which was released a few weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 41.this film does make a staement 'about Americans fighting other Americans' that seems even more profound and relevant in these hopelessly partisan times.mostly played for goofy guffaws, this is a pretty funny film comedy with lots to recommend it it terms of American history and a certain amount of war statement. at least i thought it was pretty funny.",8,0,2,7 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," 'People Are On To The Emptiness. But It Takes A Someome With Guts To See The Hopelessness'
","' someone with guts to see the hopelessness'. oooh. ouch. take that America and stick up your suburb. fortunately there is hope in that statement. it simply means that there is a whole world beyond the all-American middle class dream which, these days, sort of seems like a pipe dream. it feels like most people in American can't see out of their own little box, cubicle, tract-home or club. that's why things are so stagnant. and we keep letting the same status-quo mediocrities dictate mores and beliefs with out ever questioning them because everyone is so afraid to be different and march to their own drummer. i mean who really wants to feel like the odd man out? take it from most of us who are different. it's hard.taking a good, hard look at yourself and the environment around you is usually a pretty enlightening experience. you can, however, be a little too hard on yourself and things. Richard Yates book and Sam Mendes film is perhaps that, but it does offer insights you usually won't get from most media in this country. i never read Yate's American classic, but i do know Mendes, and viewing things from a hard perspective is what Mendes does best. look at 'American Beauty' and what excellent but hard, stern film that was. not all of America lives up to Walt Disney's idealistic vision of this country. not everything is okay with suburbia, marriage and the 'American Dream'.it's a little spooky when the only character in a play that seems sane is the crazy guy. beautifully played by Michael Shannon (was he nominated for this? he should have.)and it's equally disturbing to think death is the only way out.so much of the film is summed up in the end scenes where the couple next door decides 'we won't talk about the Wheelers again'. classic case of American denial.",8,0,0,30 June 2010
The Little Mermaid," Still Awesome After All These Years!
","i've always thought that 'The little Mermaid' was the last really, really great hand animated feature from Disney. i still love the hand drawn features, especially the recent 'Princess and the Frog' which i thought was the best they've done since 'Mermaid'. 'Mermaid' was the last animated feature that had a true 'feel' of the old school Disney cartoons. not that i didn't like 'Beauty and the Beast','Aladdin','The Lion King' or 'Pocahontas', but those films just left me a little bit cold. they didn't seem to have the same funny, quirky, quality the old school stuff did. they felt sort of heartless and over produced. more emphasis on money and polished high tech looks than on charm.'Mermaid' is not like that at all. it has an abundance of heart and charm and good old fashioned sincerity. everything about the movie clicks, is so much fun and it connects on an emotional level. 'Little Mermaid' is such a great film, very cinematic and a classic worthy of comparison with the Disney films from it's golden age. i wish i could say the same for the subsequent sequels and the popular television show which did nothing for the characters or added anything worthwhile to the memory of the original film.despite the fact that 'Little Mermaid' has been so over exposed in the media with numerous sequels and product tie-ins, the original film still retains it's impact and survives all the hard driven ubiquitousness of recent years. i hope this delightful film is always remembered well despite the over exposure.",9,1,1,18 July 2010
Insidious," Wouldn't Want To Watch It Alone, After Dark
","scary stuff. i don't know which was scarier, the supernatural chills or the fact that you can make a movie on a very low budget, gross three times that amount back and still make a film that is far better and more interesting filmmaking than a lot of the large budget CGI crap.films should be produced more economically. i hate hate huge, unnecessary expenditures in films and half the movies made don't really require or justify the budgets they have and horror films in particular, are often scarier without all the corny, overblown CGI FX.a lot of the ghostly creeps here are fairly disturbing. i was surprised at how many clichés from other horror films this movie could squeeze and still use them effectively and with a much lower film budget than those films. the elements from movies like 'Poltergiest', 'The Exorcist', Peter Jackson's 'The Frighteners', are familiar, but they have effective impact and seem different and original when applied with the lower budget.i thought Patrick Wilson was a very good sport to support low budget filmmaking since he is obviously in more demand than this. Wilson's performance is hardly the caliber of the amazing 'Hard Candy', it's not even 'Phantom of the Opera', but it's good enough to be involving.this is also one of those movies that people will predictably trash because of it's low budget. you know, the type of viewer that thinks they are not being indulged enough unless someone attempts to sink themselves financially in order to please their pampered viewing needs.this is also one of those scary horror flicks that will probably disturb the viewer more if watched alone after dark. everything is always easier to take and less scary if you watch it with a audience. but i'm not sure anyone should do that. especially if you are superstitious about demons or exorcism.scary stuff, i personally would like to see more fantasy movies like this that are unassuming and produced modestly. it leads to more interesting results.",8,1,2,2 August 2011
2012," Hollywood Mega Budgets Are Making Film Audiences Wacko. Look At All The Weird Responses.
","Look everybody. YOU ARE ACTING WEIRD. The only person who made any sense reviewing this film was Andrew Donaldson from China who said it was a diverting 'roller coaster ride' type movie, nothing more and certainly not the 'worst movie ever'. I thought he was right to criticize that 'worst movie ever' club. For one thing saying something is the worst EVER is hyperbole and superfluous. I mean EVER. I just saw 'Voyage To The Planet Of Prehistoric Women' the other night and that was a lot worse.People are never satisfied that's true, but the Hollywood mega budget turns audiences into scary demons that just want more and more and are never satisfied and are ridiculously over critical. This movie must have cost well over 100 million and some people still thought it wasn't enough. What are you looking for exactly? Personally I try to stay away from any movie that is over-hyped, cost too much money to make and is the movie that EVERYONE must see in droves. Those are all bad omens. If everyone goes to see something mindlessly in droves it's because they are the products of Hollywood Executives marketing. Executives ruin the artistic side of everything.OR DIDN'T YOU KNOW? Never bet all your money on just one horse. DIVERSIFY MORE. Just because everyone wants to see it doesn't mean it's good. Mass taste can make some very bad, soul destroying decisions.As for 2012 as a movie? The disaster flick has come a long way since the seventies and people should appreciate that. 2012 was much more imaginative than the disaster fare of yesteryear. This film probably had more in common with fifties SciFi like 'When Worlds Collide' than it did with actual disaster flicks. Even the remake of the 'Posiedon Adventure' was superior to the original.I don't even like big budget films so I don't know why I should be defending them, but if people don't either learn to diversify their taste amongst lower budget fare or at least enjoy the Hollywood behemoths they(yes they)the audience create, they damn themselves, the rest of us, and future generations to one big messy headache of cultural confusion.I also enjoy reading the reviews of people online more than I do reading professional critics, but unless everyone can follow Andrew Donaldson's example and be more thoughtful instead of sooo rash, I'll have to go back to reading the newspaper critics again. Oh God no.",7,1,2,16 April 2010
Across the Universe," Remembering Martin Luther King Jr. 1/15/2011
","i'm writing this two days late. i meant to write a review on his birth date but i was too lazy and a little depressed about the whole Arizona shootings in Tuscon. you know 'happiness is a warm gun. shoot shoot bang bang'.Julie Taymor's brilliant 'Across the Universe' seems like the perfect way to spend the MLKJR weekend. 'Universe' is actually more about the time period of 1967 than it is about The Beatles. as a matter of fact, aside from using the Fab Four's music, it really has nothing to do with The Beatles. The Beatles exist simply as a metaphor and nothing more in the film. which is just fine, since most artists who try to interpret The Beatles music usually fail. remember the dismal Bee Gee travesty 'Sgt. Ick'? unfortunately i do.Julie Taymor's direction is so breathtaking in this movie that i can't really think of anything in recent times that it compares to, with probably the exception of music videos. but this is not simply an extended music video, it truly has a good story with a very relatable plot. it also features one of the sweetest love stories i've seen in film romances.all the music is beautifully handled. the scenes that feature the songs 'Let It Be' and 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' are real standouts and very touching and memorable. T.V. Carpio gives a soulful rendition of 'Hold Your Hand' which is turned into a slow ballad and is sung by a girl who is in love with another girl. one of the best covers i have ever seen and heard.there is also a hilarious and vivacious scene in a small town bowling alley that has a nod to the audience favorite 'The Big Lebowski'. there is a camera shot of Jimmy Sturgess whistling out a little Beatles tune while he is being tossed down one of the lanes like a bowling ball. Joe Anderson, who is the film's only problem because the performance is way too cutesy, has some funny moments in this scene too.the whole cast is just remarkable in this amazing film, but the real star here is Julie Taymor's incredible film direction and set designs. i had the privilege of seeing Taymor's 'The Lion King' on stage, and i've seen the vast resources of her superior talent. can't wait to see her film of 'The Tempest'.Taymor turns 'Universe' into a real spiritual journey that crosses our universe and time. she has genuinely brought the music of last century and into this one. now the younger generation can appreciate the power of social change that the 60's and it's music had.this review is dedicated to the memory of Martin Luther King Jr. and the victims of the senseless Arizona shootings. who even, in a sense, the shooter was a victim of our troubled times too.

Kick-Ass," Hilarious. 'A Clockwork Orange' meets 'Punky Brewster'.
","i thought this movie was pretty damned funny. i suppose it might make some people uptight, but hell, you can't please all the people all the time. this movie will probably please a lot of kids and that's what probably bothers most adults.as twisted as a lot of this gets, and as much as this film parodies (violence, vigilantism, super heroes, etc.,), it most interesting element is it's statement of child empowerment. this film is good for kids believe it or not. it teaches kids to stand up for themselves, to be tough, and to believe in their own empowerment. i'm not advocating violence or irresponsible behavior for kids, i'm just saying it does'nt hurt them to have a tough role model now and again. it's a very dangerous world man has created for himself, and kids should be wary, cautious and tough. you sometimes have to learn to take a stand right or wrong, and this film is definitely about standing tall and strong.i'm not a big fan of comic books or super heroes, i used to get into all that stuff, but i pretty much put it away as i got older. i still like kid's entertainment, i mean it's all pretty darn funny, but the whole super hero thing just seems kind of naive. that's what makes this movie so amusing. it takes on the whole adolescent preoccupation with super heroes and heroes in general.super hero stuff usually bores me these days. but not this film. it was funny, satirical, and it was pretty 'kick ass'. life ain't easy, and it's a very hard place. i don't see what's wrong with telling young people the truth. it's a gentle let down and they'll get over it. if you don't want to tell them directly, have them watch this movie. it pretty much says it all, and as soon as they stop laughing and feeling giddy, they'll get the message.",8,3,8,8 August 2010
Gran Torino," Everybody Loves A classic Car
","Great car. Great entertainment. Just like the 72 Gran Torino in the movie is a classic, this is a classic Clint Eastwood movie with all the classic Clint Eastwood elements here. The only difference is this film has a softer heart to it and a message of non-violence. But Clint Eastwood can still make a line like 'get off my front lawn' sound like 'make my day' from 'Dirty Harry'. And unlike most of the Eastwood films of the past this is essentially a family flick. Cute kids, cute dogs, cute little old ladies, family values messages like don't join gangs. Need I go on?I like Clint Eastwood, but his films can be a little too hard ass and macho for me, that's why I liked this. Good values. It's nice to know the tough guy has a soft spot after all these years.",8,1,4,15 February 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Awesome,Cool,Hip,Detective Thriller. The Best Film Of This Kind Since 'Silence of the Lambs' And 'Manhunt'.
","this film really does make you want to claim the old critical cliché, 'top notch, stylish thriller', but that is a really good description of this movie. and boy was it entertaining.Noomi Rapace was awesome as the heroine Lisbeth. great performance of a really cool and high charged character. i never got to read these books, i've heard about 'em and the impact they've had on readers, but i've never read one. the last book i read was 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' and that was practically a picture book. i don't usually read best sellers, if i do pick up a book, it's usually the classics. you know, Twain, Dickens or Virginia Woolf. but i'm sure readers of these books were right about them because this movie was entertaining and very involving.the rape sequences were explicit and a little hard to take, but the brutality of the rape scenes is integral to the story development. i thought the scene where Lisbeth takes revenge and tattoo's the sadist who raped here was totally cool.i can't say i thought this movie was as thoughtful as the 'Hannibal' movies, i mean neo Nazi's and brutality toward women is not new to me. i grew up with a feminist mother and a uncle that fought in WWII, so i've heard this stuff all my life. but i thought this movie was excellent, polished and slick commercial entertainment with a super cool heroine.are they really going to make an American remake of these? that sounds F'N stupid. i mean why? these original films are just fine. but Hollywood never has an original idea these days.",8,3,6,29 November 2010
Paranormal Activity," Low Budget Scare Tactics That Work
","Forget the cynical poo-poo critics who think every movie should be a big budget mess. this film was made for a mere $15,000 and grossed $100 million at the box office. tell you something? people who demand movies to be made on a big budget are ruining our system. these people as film viewers are like the equivalent of a person who doesn't want to save the environment, believes in wasting natural resources, doesn't want to recycle anything, won't use mass transit and doesn't give a crap where all the tax dollars go. not to mention they don't care about all the disgusting over production in society. these people can't watch a movie unless it cost a $180 million to make and think a films IQ is judged by its budget and box office. sickening. no wonder the economy is in trouble with DODO birds like them constantly influencing public opinion. DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE ANYMORE. they are the majority and they are in control of your opinions.These people probably don't know much about film history or film theory, let alone common sense. films do not need to cost more to be good. films need to learn to OPTIMIZE to achieve maximum efficiency. most of the people that think low budget films are dull and a waste of time hate them because they are simply low budget. I thought we didn't like people who didn't give something a fair evaluation just because of what it was and because it was different. if we woke up we would realize these people are being unfair haters who are not evaluating the merits of a film but just annoyed with what they perceive as a rip off because some one didn't sink a ludicrous sum of money into it. WAKE UP EVERYONE. they say money can't always buy you love, it also can't always buy you talent.This was not a great film, but it was a spooky one. and it delivered it's eerie chills without a lot of bombastic effects and over-baked ideas. and like the 'Blair Witch Project' it did so with a minimum amount of wastefulness.",7,0,3,5 February 2010
Black Hawk Down," One Of The More Average War Flicks.
","i don't want to review this piece of junk but i told myself for a while i would try to review every movie i watched as a matter of exercise.this movie was no 'Bridge on the River Kawaii'. it isn't even as good as 'Tora!Tora!Tora!' it was just kind of okay.when Ridley Scott is good, he's really good.'Blade Runner' and 'Alien' are Sci Fi classics. but when he's bad he can be so dull. this movie was neither bad nor good. just dull.however the battle scenes are excellent and are done with Ridley Scott's usual attention to realism. the battle scenes are believable and almost poetic in their realism. it's the rest of the movie that falls flat.aside from the battle scenes, i just couldn't deal with the rest of this junk. the dialogue was terrible, the acting unremarkable, and the frickin ending monologue so stupid i couldn't believe it. after wasting over two hours of my life with this(i could have, should have, been doing the dishes)the damned thing couldn't make up it's mind whether it was anti-hero or pro-hero. boring.Fascist film maker Ridley Scott couldn't make up his idiot mind because we shouldn't have been in Somalia in the first place.

Big Fish," One Of Tim Burton's Very Best. A Cinema Classic.
","next to 'Ed Wood' and 'Sweeney Todd', this is my favorite of all of Tim Burton's delightful visual works. Tim Burton has never made a bad film. some are kind of a miss, like the over-blown 'Alice in Wonderland', but never are they bad. as a matter of fact they're always kind of wonderful and magical. Burton has definitely sparked and revolutionized the conscious imagination of everyone who has seen his films.this is also probably Burton's most sensitive film. it's pretty much a tear jerker, but it's not maudlin or syrupy either. just very sentimental in a rather dry, matter of fact way. it's a film that is honest about confronting death and makes no claims as to what is or isn't on the other side.to say this film (or any Burton film), is highly imaginative, would be an understatement. i grew up on Disney films, but Burton's movies have still managed to take my imagination places it had never been before. i also think it's interesting how Burton always combines surreal images with ones that feel very real and ordinary.it's also interesting to note several years later that this film marked the movie debut of Destiny Cyrus. and she's as cute as a button here. it's hard to believe she grew to be the jaded show business type she's become lately.'Big Fish' is hilarious with it's messages. of course the obvious one being the title, a big fish is a whopper,and that of course means a lie. it also points out that in a lot of fabrications there is often a lot of truth to it and to be found.",9,0,0,19 September 2010
The Graduate," Brilliant. Certainly Lives Up To It's Reputation As A Classic.
","this really is a remarkable film. i always remembered it had a good screenplay and acting, but i never really was all that aware of it's contributions to cinema technique and how it really did shape film physically and intellectually. i always thought of it as being a intellectually sound film but somewhat flat as cinematic cinema. nothing could be further from the truth.'The Graduate' isn't just intellectually sound, it's pure brilliance. it's observations on people and American, suburban life are nothing short of scathing. as has been said about the film, 'it's a brilliant satire of a society littered with cars, cocktails and swimming pools'. it's a society where people are disconnected and desperate to find a escape from their own mindless conformity, only to find themselves trapped by their limitations and inability to reject the very society and lifestyle that imprisons them emotionally and spiritually. it's almost chilling. even the young lovers at the end find that they have escaped with no real plan except to rejoin the kind of world that has objectified and oppressed them.profound. brilliant.people had very few films like this back then in the 1960's. young people had really no films like this at all. most films that were aimed at youth audiences were an illusion. youth films back then were either corny and unrealistic like the Frankie and Annette beach party movies, or they were contrived and manipulative films that attempted to warn youths on the hazards of being young and lawless. Disney baby movies don't count here because their target audience was primarily children and families. 'The Graduate' changed the look and approach to youth films forever. even though a lot of youth oriented films can capture the cinematic look of 'Graduate' these days, they can hardly match it's intellectual wit and it's integrity and sense of moral outrage. and the 'Graduate' is the true spirit of youth and being young, not some manufactured, manipulative illusion of what youth is. no matter what your age, 'The Graduate' will make you feel young just watching it.it's a little depressing to watch this film nowadays and realize how little we've learned since then and how far backward we've gone as a society. youth films today seem contrived and stupid again without the freeing qualities or sense of true morality this film has.what can ya say? everything is perfection here. the music, the direction and photography, the brilliant and insightful screenplay, and of course the outstanding performances by Hoffman and Bancroft. especially Bancroft.wow. kudos to this one. it's waaaay better than i remembered or ever realized it was. it's a little ironic that a film with such 'youthful spirit', might just take some maturity to fully appreciate it's brilliance.to all the people out that that keep allowing themselves to be objectified and brain washed and conditioned like clones, male and female, and woman DO objectify men in our society like men do to women as this film eerily points out.to all the people like benjamin and mrs. robinson. hold tight. have faith.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Valentine Memories
","'memories. of the way we were', isn't that what BaBa Streisand always caterwauled and screeched about? memories are what we are made of. they make us who we are in the present.often memories can be painful and hard to live with and we would just like to forget about them and move on. i have lots of great, happy memories, but i have more than my share of memories where there can be no closure and i would just like to erase them so i can live my life to the fullest. but then again those painful memories have taught me that life is difficult and they've taught me what to be careful of and what works for me and what doesn't. i guess even the painful memories are often good for something as well.tell that to the jerks at Lacuna who like to meddle in people's fate and hearts and play God. i guess my problem with Lacuna is that they make it too easy. without the bad you can't learn about the good.'Eternal Sunshine' is probably one of my all time favorite love stories along with 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Lady and the Tramp'. i know with all the great love stories written throughout current and classical history that's quite a claim.i don't think it's a shallow or superficially trendy claim either. this is a extraordinarily deep and moving emotional experience, and for me personally, a film that holds a very special place in my heart. if you had been through as many painful break ups as i have, you might feel the same way.not only is this film very deep, it's beautifully crafted and well made. Michel Gondry is simply one of my favorite contemporary filmmakers. not only is Gondry a total fantast of the imagination, he is a very sensitive and feeling film director. nobody in this day and age is as original with film effects and photography as Gondry. not even that weenie Tim Burton,who is one of cinema's greatest and most accomplished fantast, is as original as Gondry is with effects.Gondry has also assembled some of the finest performances of the decade. strangely, with all his enormous popularity and fame as a celebrity, Jim Carrey is a somewhat underrated actor. he's given some of the very best performances of recent times in outstanding films like 'Truman Show', 'Man in the Moon', 'Liar Liar' and of course, 'Eternal Sunshine', and yet it doesn't even seem like he's even been considered for Hollywood's most prestigious award, the Oscar. go figure. for a supposedly informed academy, the Academy Awards ALWAYS does stuff like that. that's why i think i prefer the Cannes film festival.the rest of the cast is equally outstanding. Winslet is her usually accomplished self, Wilkinson gives another thoughtful performance, and Kirsten Dunst is incredible and should have been considered for a supporting award her work here.the screenplay by Charles Kaufman and Gondry is heartfelt and sentimental without ever seeming corny or full of clichés. if anything, clichéd is something 'Eternal Sunshine' is definitely not.if you're in love, or just in a relationship, you should watch this film thoughtfully and give it some contemplation. i guarantee if you open your mind to it you will learn and grow through it's experience.perspectives of love and relationships rarely get any better than this. cinema rarely gets better than this. this film is perfect and a 'eternal' joy to behold.",10,1,2,21 February 2011
The Artist," Original, Clever And Heart Warming. What 'Best Picture' Awards Are All About
","usually i think the films that are awarded 'best picture' are often overrated. sometimes they can feel too smart even, or they play too much to audience's popular taste. 'The Artist' hits a nice and satisfying medium between the two. it's intelligent and artsy but also fulfilling on a emotional level and it's humorous and entertaining enough to play broadly.there have been recent movies made in B&W, notably most by Woody Allen, but not really this year and probably not as effectively suited to the subject matter like this. i also can't really think of too many full length, contemporary silents except for maybe Mel Brooks in 'Silent Movie'. like the use of B&W, the silent film is used effectively and appropriately.i find so few films these days with their large budgets and CGI effects to be all that interesting or exciting as cinema. this film was emotionally satisfying as well as exciting and original as a work of cinema. it was so different from everything else offered this year. it also gave considerable substance to it's gimmick.this really was a metaphor for what films in general are all about. to cite a famous cinema quote, 'that's entertainment'.",10,2,3,9 September 2012
Super 8," Barf. Over-aggrandized Kiddie Flick. Babies Might Like It.
","to quote the often scathing wisdom of gay males, 'oh pleeeeeease honey'. God. i can't believe anyone over the age of ten even liked this baby brain rot.i actually thought this movie would have some adult appeal, but- OH! how naive! instead the target audience was kids. it was just a attempt by Speilburger to recapture his 1980's kiddie audience by rehashing formulas from his dumbed down family and kiddie flicks like 'E.T.' and 'Goonies'. and oh God was this stuff so used up and totally familiar.it was all here. idealized concepts of youth and suburban childhood innocence, a whole bunch of 'Goonie' like, precocious, in your face, loud mouthed kids all talking excitedly and at once like on a unruly school bus, and of course a poor, supposedly hapless alien who wants to 'go home'. talk about obvious and familiar. this whole kid flick had the feel of somebody shoving old,stale hostess cupcakes down kid's throats.and even though you were supposed to sympathize with the alien, he was just plain creepy and scary. i mean if it was supposed to be so advanced and civilized enough to build a spacecraft on it's own, why did it eat feed on people and bite them in half and stuff? a truly advanced and civilized species would probably have a higher definition of 'intelligent life' than this. i didn't feel sorry for the alien monster one bit. i thought he was a menace to the known universe and should have been destroyed to assure safety for the common good.the train wreck at the beginning was okay and lead the viewer to believe the film would unravel some clever, unexpected mystery. well, it was unexpected. because the beginning was okay i wasn't expecting such a hokey premise and a bunch of re-used formulas from the 1980's. i felt actually cheated when i discovered how predictable the ideas that came next were. seen that, done that. seen it done much better too.the reason why they called this movie 'Super 8' was because it was a over blown entertainment for eight year olds. i can't imagine anyone over the age of eight being patient with any of this.the plot to this stinker wouldn't even justify a half hour SyFy television show. if they knew what they were doing, they would have snuffed the monster right away before he ate anybody and solved a lot of needless carnage and destruction. then this nonsense would have ended promptly and spared audiences their precious brain cells. this rot has got to be worse for your brain than smoking drugs or drinking alcohol.",6,0,1,15 June 2012
Reservoir Dogs," I'm Embarrassed To Admit A Cliché, BUT I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
","oh god. liking 'Resevoir Dogs' is sooo embarrassing. i mean it's one of those film that has pretty much become a cliché to like. every Tom, Dick and Jane loves to act cool and say they love this flick because they think it makes them cool to like it. maybe it does. i think this is a cool movie. unlike other fan bases, like the stupid 'Natural Born Idiots'(or Killers or something), or the boring, clichéd teen trends toward monsters like vampires, Wolfmen and oooooh so tedious crap like that, 'Resevoir Dogs' is a fan base cliché i can relate to. i don't know if i have anything in common with the other fans(i rarely have anything in common with most people), but i do love the frick out of this movie.'Resevoir Dogs' is on a par with great cinema with the likes of Howard Hawks(the original 'scarface' director), and Orson Welles films like 'Citizen Kane', 'Magnificent Ambersons',and 'Touch of Evil'. every thing in 'Resevoir' is superior, it's hard to imagine it was first filmed and conceived with a low budget and basically unknown actors(and director). everything about the movie is polished and slick and perfect. but it's polished professionalism doesn't get in the way of it's gritty realism. and wow, what great dialouge and acting. i could hang on every syllable and eat the whole thing up. it's a cinema dream masterpiece come true. this is what cinema is all about. gush! gush! rave! rave!one last word because i know hundreds of people have said it all, but everyone always thinks 'Pulp Fiction' is Quentin Tarantino's best movie. that's an even bigger cliché. f--k 'Pulp Fiction'!

"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," how gross. absolutely disgusting.
","i'll give Pasolini the benefit of the doubt and not rate this. i've seen this movie a few times and i just can't get used to it or accept it. my brother likes Pasolini a lot and he likes this movie which is the only reason i've watched it as many times (at least 5x) as i have over the years. i think he likes to shock me with this. i like Pasolini as a filmmaker, but i just can't handle this movie.anyone that watches this film and actually likes it should seek counseling. i don't care how intellectualized you feel the film is or what a artistic vision of Sade it is, it's just plain deviant to watch something like this. it will warp your brain children and probably help you into a whole heap of trouble. at least i wouldn't go around recommending this film or telling people that you liked it. they'll think you're one sicko puppy. this film is probably the reason why Pasolini was killed. most likely by a morally righteous viewer who was totally offended by this.i don't care what any of you say. this film is twisted. only a monster would watch this and think it's cool. if you like this movie that's bad. you shouldn't do things like this. your parents probably wouldn't like you watching this. i know my mother didn't raise me to understand this kind of vile perversion. i don't know if people who like this film should be punished by society. it's not like it's real. it's all simulated. so i suppose it's a personal choice. but people who watch this and like it should probably be monitored to see if their brains short circuit from this.look. kiddies. i like Pasolini. there were even things to admire about this production. the photography was exquisite. the women who played the dirty whores were excellent and their gowns were just beautiful as was all the costume design. the musical score is elegant and classy, and most of all, Criterion, as usual, has given us another immaculately restored and beautiful film print of a historical work of cinema. yeah i believe 'Salo' deserves a place in film history. a notorious one however.if you can handle this monstrosity then go for it. if you like to read Sade then that's yer prerogative. but don't expect decent people to love or accept you for it. more than likely they will be afraid of you and probably with good reason. when they're not showing excrement in this film, they're talking about it. i don't even want to tell the dark secret of why 'Salo' offends 'good taste'. but lets just say it brings a whole new meaning to the term 'a acquired taste'.

War of the Worlds," Finally They Got H.G. Wells's Vision Right For Once.
","'But who shall dwell in these worlds if they be inhabited?...Are we or they Lords of the world?...And how are all things made for man?'I have always been a big fan of the author H.G. Wells since my youth. I always enjoyed his works like 'Time Machine', 'Food of the Gods', 'The First Men on the Moon', 'In The Days of the Comet',and so on. I love Wells's vision and his books are always short and easy reading. When I heard Hollywood wanted to do yet another version of 'War of the Worlds' I groaned. Surprisingly this turned out to be the definitive version of the book. Much better than the original George Pal movie (which I liked), and far better than the subsequent TV versions.Most everything Wells envisioned is here. The tripod aliens, the deadly vapor heat rays, the horrifying red vines, so many of the situations are similar to the book. Of course the book was happening in England a hundred years ago and there were no children, just the man and his wife.It is also interesting to note that the action and Fx of different disasters are so much more believable and real than the cornball action in something like '2012'. The optical composite shots may have been more advanced in '2012', but the action was ludicrous. Nothing in '2012' was remotely believable. I'm not saying the alien effects here were realistic, of course not. But the scenes of buildings crumbling and streets cracking were way more real. The FX in '2012' may have been more advanced, but nothing was staged with any attention to actual reality. In Spielberg's film they are very convincing.Tom Cruise is also excellent. The character of the father is a average, blue collar, working class joe. Cruise brings this off convincingly. It is also a little ironic to note that his performance here as an average guy has more emotion, personality and depth, than Cruise the actor seems to have in his real life. It's almost like a person who isn't very real playing someone who is real. Strange huh? The children are also convincing too. They seem like real kids, difficult and hard to manage.Usually I like more realistic sci-fi like '2001' or science fact like the excellent 'Apollo 13'. But H.G. Wells's story was a fantasy and Spielberg does justice to it, mean and nasty aliens and all.I'm not even all that into Spielberg sci-fi either. I thought 'ET' and 'Close Encounters' were so corny and simplistic. I liked his film 'AI' though.This was a great adaptation. now let's hope we can finally get a good adaptation of 'Food of the Gods' and 'Empire of the Ants'. Maybe Spielberg should try his hand at those. He did so well with this project. A real first rate sci-fi classic.",9,2,7,29 September 2010
A Hard Day's Night," One Of Cinema's Greatest Pleasures
","Richard Lester's 'A Hard day's Night', is one of cinema's greatest pleasures and one of my favorite film's of all time. if i had a top twenty, this film would definitely be in it.the whole film is an exercise in cinema technique and an beautiful example of B&W cinematography. The Beatles are also the best comedians cinema has ever put forth next to the likes of Charlie Chaplin and The Marx Brothers.everybody always talks about the music genius of the Fab Four but they are seldom given credit for their superior comic ability. they are masters of sly improvisation and visual humor. and even though they can be bratty and smart aleck, they have loads of endearing charm.this movie also co-stars the hilarious Wilfred Bramble as Paul's 'other' grandfather. every time Bramble pulls one of his exasperating and annoying little shenanigans, everyone shrugs their shoulders and says, 'well at least he's clean'. pure hilarity ensues every time Bramble is on the screen.Richard lester really did revolutionize cinema at the time, and this is probably the best example of it. not to mention the music is wonderful.this is no mere rock n rolla film. this is cinema at it's finest and most enjoyable. just because it's cute and endearing doesn't mean it isn't a great work of art and filmmaking.i really like Lydon and the Sex Pistols, but when it comes to their opinion of The Fab Four, i say screw 'em if they can't lighten up and enjoy something fun (and brilliant) like this.",10,0,0,22 January 2011

Toy Story 3," Hysterically Funny.
","i'm probably the only Disney fan on the planet who thinks the Disney computer animated films are somewhat over-rated. don't get me totally wrong, i think they're still great films and definitely the leader in current CGI animation and the top in the craft. i just always have happened to like hand drawn cartoons better than CGI. hand drawing always feels funnier and more spontaneous than CGImy favorites of the CGI Disney/Pixar films are 'Finding Nemo' and 'Cars', but i've always liked the 'Toy Story' films despite all the hype and marketing tie-ins that always drive clever and original ideas into the ground and make them seem less original and makes them seem so common.the 'Toy Story' trilogy of films has survived so much mindless marketing and over-exposure that i probably should have expected the third sequel to come through. but i didn't. i kind of thought it would be dull and predictable and all the spark of originality bull dozered out by commercialism. not at all. in fact it was one of the most consistently funny of all the 'Toy' movies. maybe not the curtest or the best, but i thought it was the funniest. and the plot with the Sunnyside Daycare was really subtle and hilarious in a cute-sinister way. the idea of toys selling out other toys in order to gain advantage seemed all too real and indicative of the sad state of human affairs.even though this film was very family oriented mostly, i thought it a little strange that a lot of this was kind of dark and scary. this is probably the most suspenseful and disturbing of all the 'Toy' movies. it wasn't just the chilling concept of the toys selling out other toys, but a lot of the situations the toys faced were dangerous and frightening. i mean the whole scene with the garbage dump furnace made the horror scenes in Sid's bedroom seem gentle.so far at number '3', the 'Toy Story' animated films still earn their charming legacy and place in Disney fan's hearts. all you have to do is read the overwhelming amount of positive reviews this film has received from reviewers online. the 'Toy Story' movies are amongst the very few commercial products Hollywood turns out that are truly worthy of the love and praise they receive. something Disney has always managed to do from the beginning, manufacture good movies that have cleverness and heart in a mostly cold, commercial Hollywood market.",8,1,1,22 November 2010

","what. this was so awful you've got to be kidding. flawed history is an understatement! taking a few liberties with history is different from out and out distorting it. the whole movie was a frick'in half baked nutty mess.i'm no stranger to Queen Elizabeth movies. i've seen the old Bette Davis turkey and i've had the pleasure of seeing the awesome Glenda Jackson do this role twice in 'Mary Queen of Scots' and in the outstanding emmy award winning 'Elizabeth R'. the Glenda Jackson movie and the BBC series were so much better than this junk and a lot more historically accurate. this movie wasn't fun or entertaining, it was too stupid and boring and totally unreasonable in it's depiction of history to be enjoyable. i mean you have to check your brain in at the damn door just to be able to get into this.the idea of Elizabeth as an feminist action hero who leads her troops to battle in a suit of armor is, well, the most insanely ridiculous portrayal i can think of. i'm sorry but that never happened. not only will you get the wrong idea of history but nothing is to be gained at all by such a dumbed down approach. i thought Sophia Coppola's film of 'Marie Antoinette' was kind of ding-a-ling, but compared with this that film was a monument to intelligence. what sort of idiot would accept film making on this level? don't people like to think anymore? i hate the hyperbole of the 'worst movie ever' crowd but...THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!everything about this was a pee-yew stinker. the acting was monstrously awful (and i like Blanchett, Owen, and Rush, but what were they thinking?!), the cinematography was murky, monochromatic and dull, the FX were corny and predictable and the script had contrived, silly, dialogue. i can't believe Blanchett was nominated for this puke. i mean what's up with that? it's kind of weird how actress's playing Queennie 'R' always get nominated. Bette Davis was nominated for her performance(excellent performance, bad movie), and Glenda Jackson was nominated for 'Queen of Scots' and 'Elizabeth R'(Jackson was great and both projects intelligent and satisfying).personally i would be afraid of anyone who liked this mud. i mean who would like something this distorted and murky awful? whatever makes someone like such a blatant rewrite of history? i hope whatever it is it's not catching like a bad case of cooties.was there anything decent about this brain rot junk? yeah. it was so funny i couldn't stop laughing especially the end where Blanchett looks into the camera and gets really holy and preachy. the only thing funnier than this movie is someone who would be fool enough to recommend this rubbish with a straight face.",2,2,5,30 June 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," An Author's Rare Insight Into 'The Disney Touch'.
","This film, and it's historical footnote, are the first time we've ever really heard a author's view and feelings about the legendary Disney treatment or 'Disney touch'. Most of the famous stories Disney made into movies are by authors who have long been dead and have never been able to express their opinion about what Disney did with their works. One can easily imagine that J.M. Barrie, Lewis Carroll, and Collodi, would all have some complaint with Disney's pop culture, Hollywood approach.In 'Saving Mr.Banks' we get a first hand account of how 'Mary popping's' author P.L. Travers felt about Disney and his liberties with her stories. Travers was alive and well at the time and Disney had to face up to the author face to face. This movie does not exaggerate much. There are endless recording sessions that were made during the creative process and Travers can constantly be heard groaning 'no, no, no'. It was no inside secret that Travers was highly critical of the Disney machine.There are a few anachronisms here but basically this film sticks close to the facts and the truth. At least about her involvement with the Disney studio. Her personal life I know little about.There is so much in this film that is impeccable, but for me, it was the depiction of Walt Disney by an actor, and wow was Tom Hanks uncanny in resemblance, and the depiction of the Sherman brothers. For any die hard Disney fan, these performances are pure gold, especially Hanks.I've always loved Disney and have a real fondness for his musical 'Poppins'. Disney felt is was his crowning achievement and one of his greatest works. 'Poppins' is perfect subject matter for a film that pays homage to one of the most talked about men of our time.",9,0,2,13 January 2014
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Side-Splittingly Hilarious
","this was so frick'in funny i almost bust a gut. the movie was really trippy. it was like watching a retro stop motion cartoon, a Roald Dahl story, and a Wes Anderson film with all those elements playing equally. i mean i thought this was going to be basically a straight adaptation of the book and a stop motion film that had Anderson's name on it. i was amused to find how much it seemed like a Wes Anderson film. it had so many of the elements that made 'Aquatic' and 'Darjeeling' so good.George Clooney does more than just give his usual first rate performance here. he's hilarious. there is just something about his straight forward delivery that just sends you sprawling on the floor laughing. the rest of the cast is very funny and Jason Swartzman is especially cute.you won't get how funny the film is unless you note how subtle the humor actually is. take the one scene where the foxes are relaxing outdoors and listening to the song 'Love' from Disney's cartoon classic 'Robin Hood'. another well known cartoon about foxes.this was a great return to classic hand done stop motion animation. it's great that some people can still master the old craftsmanship and don't let it die. they say Wes Anderson was hardly present during the filming. strange, since his style and approach is all over this movie. funny stuff.",9,1,2,9 April 2010
Cinderella," Cinderelly, Cinderelly. Any Girl Can Be A Princess.
","a lot of people like to dismiss 'Cinderella' as a unremarkable Disney product, but those who do so obviously haven't given it enough thought or compared it to other hand animation.not only does 'Cinderella' feature some attractive 50's style animation and lush color design, it also has some of most skillful characterizations and storywork of all the Disney classics. 'Snow White' might be a better film, but the story and script and characters are done with more complexity and dimension. Snow may be sweeter and cuter, but Cindy seems more like a real person and not so much of a cartoon caricature. she also feels older and more mature than the somewhat tweeny Snow.the story also is scripted to elicit strong emotional responses from it's audience. to quote Disney historian Leonard Maltin, 'there are more scenes calculated to traumatize a viewer in 'Cinderella' than in practically any other Disney animated feature'. the scene where the stepsisters rip Cinderella's dress to shreds is probably bound to disturb some children more than the 'enchanted' scares in the other films because it's a very real and human, and the sisters are human and not witches. also there is my favorite moment when the stepmother trips the Grand Duke, who is carrying the glass slipper, and the slipper falls to the floor and smashes to bits. i can remember being a child and being very taken aback by that moment.the color styling and animated special effects are some of Disney's most beautiful and striking. the pastel hues of pink and blue really define the film's memorable look. the sequence where Cinderella and the Prince dance out into the garden boast some amazing colored animation effects. when the fairy Godmother transforms the pumpkin into a coach is some of the most breathtakingly fluid and detailed animation i've ever seen. the images literally make your eyes move in all directions while viewing.and of course the songs and score, like most Disney classics, is charming. often music in children's films can make or break the film and turn the whole thing into a droning, sappy, sugary, kiddie mess. not with 'Cinderella'. the songs are nicely done and not a overworked hodge-podge of kiddie clichÃ©s.feminist have always claimed a problem with the Cinderella story. we've all heard the tiresome 'cinderella complex' theory. there is something to that but really, you shouldn't let your childhood stories mess you up like that. i also present this alternative outlook to the story and film. first, in the original fairy tale, Cinderella takes revenge on the mother and sisters with hot coals on their feet and has the dove peck there eyes out. eek. second, in the Disney version Cinderella does not complacently sit there and wait for her princey. Cindy attempts to make her own gown and get there herself. if you know the Disney version, you know Cindy takes a lot of initiative. with apologies to Linda Woolverton, not everything is in need of a feminist twist.next to 'Snow white', this is my favorite Disney princess story. this cartoon has been with me all my life, and it still rings true for me to this very day.",10,1,2,27 December 2010
The Truman Show," One Of The Best, Most Beautiful And Moving Films Of The 1980's
","i don't know why i compare the two, but i think this movie is even better than Terry Gilliam's amazing film classic 'Brazil'. it's just feels deeper and more moving. it's not that the whole Amnesty Int. thing in 'Brazil' wasn't moving, i just like Peter Weir's film better.Peter Weir is an unusual and intelligent film maker. his films never cater to mass taste and his early films are basically foreign 'indie' films. early Peter Weir films like 'Pinic at Hanging Rock' and 'The Last Wave', are brilliant and intellectually provocative works of intense cinema.this has got to be Peter Weir's broadest film. it plays to a broad audience and caters to mass taste. even though Weir worked with Harrison Ford on two movies, 'Witness' and 'Mosquito Coast', those movies had less of a broad audience appeal.'Truman' also has a timely quality that even seems more relevant today than ever with the influx of reality shows inundating the current media. and with all the 'big brother' conspiracy theories out there today, 'The Truman Show' reads kind of like a comedy conceived by George Orwell.and what can you say about Jim Carey? excellent. i can't believe he wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar for this. he makes Truman Burbank a cute, likable, even kind of schmaltzy, character without losing the depth and serious side to the performance.a brilliant and wonderful film. it also should be noted that even though it's aimed at adults, nothing here is offensive and is suitable viewing for the whole family.",10,0,2,26 July 2010
Moon," One Of The Best Sci-Fi Films Ever
","For anyone that is tired of all the shamelessly hyped,un-realistic sci-fi mumbo jumbo that is offered today 'Moon' is definitely the right film. In the great tradition of '2001' everything in 'Moon' is based on science fact and is plausible, unlike most of the silliness that passes itself off as science these days.Let's face it. most present sci-fi fare is not even believable let alone science. Stephen Hawking and Ray Bradbury both criticized current sci-fi for having too much fantasy and not enough actual science in it. Most sci-fi films are usually just a lot of unbelievable fantasy gobblygook that has very little to do with real science speculation. 'Moon' is first rate intelligent sci-fi that won't turn your brains to mush like so much of the stuff out there today.Sci-fi should be realistic. leave the over-wrought fantasy stuff to the kiddies. It was terrible the way the sci-fi channel took an intelligent,believable sci-fi classic book and film like the 'Andromeda Strain' and turned into silly half-baked fantasy.Everything about 'Moon' is outstanding. The realness, the special effects and the incredible Sam Rockwell giving yet another amazing performance. This should be the buzz film of the year, this should be the film everyone wants to see and is talking about, not the over-budget sci-fi junk that everyone is into.",9,3,6,25 January 2010
The Wizard of Oz," There's No Place Like 'OZ'
","i love 'Oz'. and NO i do'nt mean some stupid jail cell. anyone who associates 'Oz' with a prison should probably be locked in one. Just like 'candyman' from 'Willy Wonka' doesn't mean some scary black guy spewing bees from his mouth. Jeez. i can't believe some of the connections i've heard people make over the years.i'm not going to say much because there's not much more you can say about this film that the fan base hasn't already gushed out with enthusiasm.the songs and dialogue are great. in fact they are extremely witty and totally hilarious. people underestimate how truly funny this film really is. they often play up the sentimental elements and forget how truly funny all this really is.not to mention how nightmarish and disturbing it all gets. i don't know about you all, but the flying monkey's and the wicked witch still scare the heckameyer out of me.",10,9,10,12 September 2010
Up in the Air," Timely Movie About The Unemployed
","this movie really says it all for so many Americans who don't have unions,job security or have seen their benefits dwindle as the years go by.George Clooney, a.k.a The Fantastic Mr. Fox, tucks his bushy tail into a business suit for one of those dubious jobs that some of us wonder how a person can do and live with themselves. Some of us could never be bill/debt collectors no matter how hard we try. I had to quit a asst. manager position when i was younger because i was incapable of ordering people around or firing them. i just don't have it in me to be ruthless when another person's livelihood is at stake. call me a wimp i don't care. being ruthless doesn't seem all that humane or Christian-like. treating your fellow man with tolerance and compassion is all that matters in the good book.George Clooney is one of those intelligent actors that always seems to pick intelligent, worthwhile projects. if he chooses a film it is usually worth the time to check out. even if the movies not great, there is always something to it. i didn't think this film was great cinema, but it was well acted, written and directed, and it had a very compassionate, human message. definitely an important and current one.",8,0,2,24 April 2010
