Marie Antoinette," Gidget Goes to Versailles
","and when she gets there, she gets bored, gossips, reads Rousseau, and has beach-blanket pot parties in Amadeus outfits. I did like the music, there is one inspired masked ball and a good 'watch the sun rise' scene - the strength of this film is its connection to high school culture, seen through the eyes of a sweet, utterly conventional and finally boring teenage girl, projected from the California suburbs onto 18th century France. This is obviously also the film's weakness: this movie is a beautiful, expensive still life that knows nothing at all about French history, Europe, the Revolution, the Bourbons, how the ancien regime worked, how incompetent wars and not Marie Antoinette's Imelda-Marcos-like shoe fetish ran up the debt, about the conflict in North America with England and Spain, about how leading members of French government actually had brains - the films displays a nitwit, decadent, wig-loving, golden-furniture France as though seen by a France-hater in the Bush administration. As my brother pointed out, the movie also blew the subject of a potentially great movie, which is Marie Antoinette's inspired, sometimes brilliant defense of herself at her later trial. Trying to learn about what happened to the French court from this film is like trying to learn about American corporate culture by watching J.R Ewing's 30 second business deals at the Cattlemen's Club on Dallas. Well sure, politics wasn't the subject of the movie, but why is the 'chick stuff' buried in diamonds and champagne? That makes these women seem way less tough and intelligent than they actually were in the bloody contact sport of French court politics. As an American watching this in Paris I was struck by the film's lack of historical, political, and cultural sophistication, in which Dunst is in every single frame and it's all one gigantic royal slumber party until the peasants show up in an illiterate wordless mass baying for bread and blood and shaking their satanic harvesting tools. Ouch: The film makes the most sense as a weird allegory of Hollywood inbreeding.",4,586,909,26 May 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," recycled Gangnam Trek
","I see anything Star Trek as a matter of lifelong habit, and don't mind J.J. Abrams' rich kid versions--as long as I'm not bored while watching them. But I lost interest in this one about half-way through. It is too formulaic not to be predictable, the hyperrealism of the refitted 1960s characters loses its novelty, the randomized emotional shifts become tiring, and the pile up action sequences get too relentless and implausible to be entertaining. There are moments of funny writing, and the total lack of originality is supposed to be a feature not a bug, so I often enjoyed the accents and personality quirks I remember from watching the first series as a kid. But the core group, led by the Boy Kirk, is too frat house to be very interesting, their girl sidekick less important than, say, Storm in the X-Men, and the male friendship issues repetitive and adolescent. Other reviewers have pointed out the CGI overkill, and that the somewhat desperate action sequences are coupled with a general emotional immaturity (one reviewer called it kill-cry-kill-cry). Both are true, and the result is that Abrams has come full circle not so much to the Saturday Matin√©e 2.0 as created by George Lucas, but to the cartoon, where implausibility and even idiocy are supposed to be part of the fun. One unintentionally hilarious sequence involves the Boy Kirk kicking some machinery until it works, and my movie date pointed out that this is a kind of metaphor for the film itself.On to the 'liberal philosophy' that someone points out is another of the film's direct borrowingsfrom the 1960s version. The movie is wrapped around the Global War on Terror: there's a conflict between using Starfleet for military or for exploratory purposes. You can guess which side the good guys are on. But everything in the film is threat and response to threat. The positions are (1) kill first, because they are coming to kill you, or (2) kill, but only in self defense. In contrast, the 60s show was full of cultural differences, philosophical divergence, emotional incomprehension, and an interesting fact about human life, which is that in many situations that matter most, 'you're both right.' 1960s Trek focused repeatedly on a situation in which the crew *believes* they face a military threat, but discover that it's not a military threat, and in fact not a threat at all. Seeing a threat turns a complicated counter into a threat, and that deeply militaristic habit of seeing threats becomes the source of the problem. In the current film, we have two positions: GWOT is regrettable (cry) tied to GWOT is inevitable (kill). In the original show, the GWOT frame would have turned out to be a mass delusion, while this film can't really imagine that things are *not* what they appear to be. So there isn't anything really to think about while you're waiting for the overblown action to die down, and by hour 2, I wanted it to stop.",3,4,9,2 June 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Great, subtle story of liberation from the middle-class
","I finally saw Little Miss Sunshine last night and liked is as much as everyone else did. I had a special fondness for what happens to the family, where things start bad and get much better. The father, Richard, is trying to make it as a self-improvement guru by selling his 9 -steps to winning formula. His only idea is that the world has two kinds of people, winners and losers, and the most important thing in life is that you not be a loser. Losing is signified by the other people in the picture: the nation's foremost Proust scholar (with the beard) who has just tried to kill himself over a grad-student love gone wrong, the son who reads Nietzsche, refuses to speak, and wants to fly fighter jets, and above all the grandfather in the background, who snorts heroin, loves porn and sex equally, and swears like the blue-collar stalwart that he is. The mom holds it all together of course, and the 7-year-old daughter, who dreams of being crowned Little Miss Sunshine (not pictured), has unwittingly inherited her dad's desire to leave struggling working-classdom and enter the middle-class of sexpot-princess little Barbie girls.I will try not to spoil the plot while still saying why this movie came as a huge relief to me. Richard is a schmuck whose desire to be a rich guru make his family angry and miserable and make him powerless himself. But as it turns out he doesn't have to be that way. OK, I'm about to spoil the plot a little bit: Richard turns out to be more like his badass dad than he wants to believe, and so does the Proust scholar, and so does the weirdly mixed Air Force- intellectual son, and this is certainly true of Olive, the true Little Miss Sunshine. There's a lot of comedy extracted from the car troubles of people who can't afford new ones, and the film winds up as a study of class conflict in which, for once in Hollywood, going back to your unselfconscious and impulsive working-class self makes you 'win.'I don't mean they win as the solid middle-class defines it, but as soon as Richard - without consciously deciding to - stops trying to rise and just throws himself into the mission of getting Olive to her contest, everything gets better. The movie rejects the classically stupid middle-class assumption that solidarity means reduced efficiency and self-fulfillment. The movie rejects the bourgeois failure to fight: things bump along once Richard and the rest of them just go with the screwed-up van, their lateness, their loser-ness, once they start bending and breaking the middle-class rules. Heroics aren't necessary, just a certain non- intimate acceptance of each other, that things will never be normal, that as people they aren't normal, that they don't have to be normal, and than in non-normalcy there is strength.This makes Little Miss Sunshine a great parable of the middle-class ceasing to hate itself, embracing its blue-collarness (you'll know what I mean when you see Olive's actual contest dance), and being way way better off. Liberation from middle-class aspiration looks like people pushing a busted van. They have lost first-gear but have finally - to their enormous benefit - they have learned not to miss it.Plus it's pretty hilarious, with great performances from absolutely everybody. And for why Little Miss Sunshine is so much more illuminating, see my explanation at Middle Class Death-Trips (toodumbtolive.blogspot.com)",10,2,4,30 December 2006
Hero," beautiful pro-imperial dumbness
","It's really beautiful, and makes the Matrix boys look like the kids they are.  But what is  this movie actually saying? Try this: rather than fighting murderous, expansionist  emperors, would-be heros should realize that all the emperor wants is peace.  As in the  past, China will reunite the 'seven kingdoms' under one great father for the good of all.Since when did the tradition that brought us a really good Western about the Qin  dynasty, Ashes of Time, degenerate into this pro-imperial dumbness?",Null,0,0,11 November 2003
Blood Diamond," Good - for Hollywood!
","This is classic Hollywood 'dual-use' - tell a popular story to send a serious message. The idea is that you can use formula elements to get a huge audience who then learns uncomfortable things. You can tell the truth about the world and make enormous amounts of box office - no conflict there, right? The movie takes on big issues like child soldiers, diamond wars, failed states, kids with chopped-off hands, random slaughter of villagers, millions of refugees. It has excellent Hollywood production values - the action scenes dip you into terrifying violence and stir you around. The lead performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Djiman Hounsou are wonderful. DiCaprio's character, an ex-military diamond smuggler, is interesting and complex. But there are limits to dual-use strategy. The white hero has a love interest, an implausibly beautiful American journalist who tries to flirt her way into a scoop and then implausibly toughens up. In a Hollywood film individuals always have to be able to make a difference and not just save their own skin, so Solomon Vandy's search for his family is juxtaposed with the more ridiculous, self-flattering story of a journalist taking on the world-wide diamond trade. Finally, there's Hollywood's compulsory narcissism, which means that it can't explain why control of diamond fields requires rebel posses to massacre innocent villagers, or imagine African solutions to anything. There's a weird racism floating through all the sympathy for African victims, so that the rebel army scenes are shot Pirates-of-the-Caribbean style with gun-toting children dancing insanely around roaring fires in bloody compounds in an unwitting repeat of old Western stereotypes of bloodthirsty African savages. In Hollywood dual-use, structural problems are suppressed in favor of lone villains with a long reach, so that it is impossible to imagine, for example, that there may be a problem with capitalism itself, which has done so little good for so long for Africa. It all leads to a consumer boycott, the ultimate middle-class American political gesture - to not shop for one thing we want! It's true that Americans aren't interested in wearing 'conflict diamonds' dug by one-handed African slave children. It's true that Hollywood does not exist in order to refute naive business books like 'The World Is Flat.' But putting a little more African thought and society in place of American journalists might have made the movie's hope for the future at least half as convincing as its blood-soaked action.",7,0,2,10 December 2006
Lord of War," come on, tell an actual story will you?
","OK look, this movie gets an A for its bold moral stand: it is AGAINST gun running that KILLS PEOPLE! Especially poor African people who have been royally screwed by warlords and their tireless posses of sadistic killers. I was waiting for the audience member who would cheer the AK loving crazed son of a dictator using starving refugees for target practice, but to my surprise, nobody did. Score one for finding a topic on which EVERYONE will agree with you - random death in pointless wars fueled by amoral arms dealers is bad.But would you like to know why a single one of these countless wars starts or continues? Or about the big business of arms trading, i.e. legal companies and not one guy working out of storage container under a bridge? You won't learn anything about these things in this film. What you will learn is the Hollywood lesson that moral feeling is the important thing. And the American political lesson: you are either for it or against it, so why have facts, geopolitics, economics, connect people to motives (besides money, drugs, and hookers), or any of that boring crap that explains how things actually work?? You will also learn the following: Africans are either victims, looters, or mindless killers; African leaders are mindless killers; Africans die because their leaders are mindless killers (oh yes, with First World guns); African dictators's sons like gold chains, gold-plated AKs, gold watches, local Ho's in Dallas cheerleaders outfits, and mindless killing; Africa has lots of local Ho's who like to watch people being mindlessly killed; the top international arms dealers ride in their own planes to deliver the goods to Sierra Leone or wherever; former communist generals will sell billions in lethal arms to whomever for a Rolls and a VCRand so on. I'm not being too nice about this film, which is on an important topic, has a good cast and many good moments. Plus parts of the film offer a descent into hell that has some real power. But the film accepts that the average audience consists of political children who don't know about the arms trade or that the US government is a world leader in it. Therefore the film illustrates this fact rather than telling a story that would analyze this fact. The filmmakers make the usual mistake of assuming no one will watch a movie that doesn't eliminate all complexity in favor of a story about one or more movie stars acting normal in abnormal situations and talking about it. Oddly enough, this comes off as more didactic rather than less, since the lessons don't flow from the missing complex structure but from the stars' reciprocal speeches. Too bad.",6,1,5,28 January 2006
The Good Shepherd," Should Have Been Zombie film
","This was a snooze-fest about the empty WASPs who ran an empty US foreign policy. I stayed awake so as not to offend my pal Rebecca who took me to it, and entertained myself by wondering if the film was cleverly thematizing boring emptiness or just being boring and empty without meaning to. Sadly, there were no other signs of cleverness in the film, just ghosts of two decent ideas. One was about the effects of this post-war emptiness at the top of US society -that the deadliness of the US in the Cold War came less from necessary responses to real threats than from our own leaders' emotional exhaustion and intellectual emptiness (the USSR military is described as a sham by one would-be defector our hero Matt Damon has been busy torturing). This idea is like an object in one of the photos the techie spooks analyze that you can infer but never actually see. The second ghost of an idea came from my pal Rebecca, who recalled the film's only good line. Italian mobster Joe Pesci names a few things different US ethnic groups have and then asks the typically silent and inert Damon, 'what do you people have'? 'We have the United States of America,' Damon replies. 'The rest of you are just visiting.' Rebecca said that this could have been a movie about the CIA as an agent of white supremacy. True, but it was just ghost #2. Some IMDb reviewers have complained about Jolie's performance, among others. I don't think any of the performances are bad as such - Jolie's is technically quite good - but there IS something wrong with the characters and their interactions. The film plays like a group vanity project in which Di Niro and crew put on an extra-long after-dinner skit for their wealthy liberal friends. They know things have gone bad in America, they don't like American foreign policy and all the dirty tricks and killing. But they don't know what went wrong, or why, or what to do about it. They especially don't think that they benefit from any of this killing - that the CIA has been quite handy at giving the U.S., a declining manufacturing and increasingly corrupt power, unfair advantages in the world, advantages that in turn lead to Hollywood and Wall Street's ridiculous wealth. Could part of America's problem be exactly this kind of mental passivity and actual indifference to democracy among the most privileged members of the middle class? Gosh! It raises a question I sometimes blog about on 'Middle-Class Death Trips' - did we long ago trade in democracy and camaraderie with the rest of the world for the sake of unearned, coerced global privileges? Just like Damon's character, the movie isn't self-aware enough to ask any such question, and the result is really boring, all the big implications gone missing.",3,1,5,4 January 2007
