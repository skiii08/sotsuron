The Avengers," The Kids Avengers
","This was a highly anticipated title for me and may be for everyone else as well. But when I actually saw this Movie, I don't think this movie deserves this type of rating. Its so much over rated.I don't mean this move is bad, the movie is good but so over rated and you will only find kid's stuff in there. I think this one is really made for little kids. Don't watch this movie expecting something like Iron Man 2 or Thor. It is not very well written and the plot is not very strong, not a serious movie. I think having this type of budged and all the great actors is such a waste. And I believe only the kids have rated it so high.If you want to enjoy this movie then do not expect anything like iron man or Thor, you will be disappointed if you will have those expectations.The major issue with this movie is its script and weak plot, the antagonist is incredibly cheap and stupid as well. They could have used some better ideas. Although there are a lot of special effects and a lot of actions which is good. But it just do not fits it to an 8+ it is an average movie which deserves something 6/10. So don't believe the hype.Thank you, Khurram Saeed.",6,3,8,25 August 2012
The Expendables 2," All The Stars Are Shining!!!!
","I just had the experience of watching The Expendables 2, Sunday night, and it was great and satisfying. The movie is loaded with full of action from the moment it starts to the very end. All the characters have a very good harmony and are full of style. You will also enjoy the punch lines they exchange through out the movie.You can see Arnold in action this time, which really adds up to the movie. Chuck Norris is also in a stunning and stylish role. The female member of the group Maggie(Nan Yu) also fits in the team/story very well.All the actors appear more than they had in the original, including Bruce and Arnold.Van Damme has also played very very good role as 'Villain' and still shows us his good martial arts skills. I loved watching him in action at this age. I wish this film makes a good comeback for him.As for the story, some reviewers are complaining that it has a poor story. But I do not agree because having such action packed and tough characters who cares about the story? All you will want from these characters is ACTION which you will find plenty through out. All the cast has played their roles very well. And I will give this Eight Stars. My salute to this band of mercenaries!I will recommend this movie to all the people who love action and to all the people who like to watch movies because You are not gonna find the assembly of these CLASSIC ACTION HEROES anywhere else. This is a must watch for everyone. Thank you.Khurram Saeed.",8,3,6,28 August 2012
