The Avengers," Most DISAPPOINTING Superhero show in 2012
","At first when I heard of this show, I was kinda excited about it. But when I went to the cinemas yesterday to watch it, I was tempted to leave my seat already at the early part of the show. It's not the characters or actors that is horrible, it's the director to be honest. I don't know how the script writers come what with this or even how the director approve it, but the lines and conversation were so fake, blunt and seriously horrible. It lakes emotions, feelings or even creativeness. Let alone, the whole plot is too predictable and boring. No doubt the action scenes is good and the graphic is awesome, but the plot and horrible lines just make this show right at the bottom of my list for shows in 2012. I rather watch 'The Dark Knight' anytime rather than this horrible show. Even friends of mine who are crazy about DC and Marvel comics were absolutely disappointed in this show. In fact, they leave the theatres during halfway of the show. This is just an example to show how horrible it is. All in short, this show to me is not worth watching or buying and was a waste of 143 minutes of my time.",1,124,261,29 June 2012
Prometheus," Not as good as it seems
","This show have it's good point, but mostly, it's all bad. The starting of the show seems rather alright as it was flowing rather smoothly. However, already at the beginning of the show, it was extremely boring. I find myself nearly dozing off at the front part of the show as all that talking without the suspense which it was suppose to have just makes it dreadful to watch. At least at the later part of the show begins to get more interesting and the suspense was starting to build up. But the ironic thing is that the story wasn't flowing properly as it progresses deeper. In fact, the plot seems to be mixing up at the last few part and it felt more like the director was vomiting out whatever he could to end the show, something to me which makes it extremely horrible. But the only plus side to the story is that it is not predictable as I thought it would. To conclude, it's not really worth the time to watch or let alone buy the DVD. If you are really interested to watch the movie, I recommend you wait for HBO or FOXMovies Premium to play it on TV.",4,8,13,29 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises has make it's mark
","There are many superhero movies that are produce throughout the years and most of the time, it's either still or if not horrible. Just like the Avengers, a show whose plot is so predictable and boring as they just copy and paste most of the scenes from the comic book. Thus, it become pointless to watch. For that, I have to give credit to Christophor Nolan as for all the 3 Batman movies he directed, he has always manage to keep reality in touch with the show and he dares to take the risk of coming out with a complete new creative story rather than just copying from the comic books which is what 'The Avengers' and 'The Amazing Spider Man' did. And let me safely say that Christophor Nolan risk taking has truly paid off with this epic conclusion of the Batman series.No doubt I have to admit that I was rather worried whether the show will be as good as the predecessor, The Dark Knight. But looks like I was worried for no reason at all. One good thing I should note about this show is that it's not always what it seem to be. Just like it's predecessor, the plot has a very interesting twist at the end. Well let me tell you this, so does The Dark Knight Rises.Also, Christophor Nolan idea on combining emotion and suspense to this show was indeed a brilliant move to me. Best of all, the actors were able to act that emotional scene very well.However, it's rather amusing though. I read several critics and user reviews and I have to say, their argument on why the show is bad is because the plot is reveal very late and that they find it tiresome to wait for the show to fill in the gaps. Some examples of the gaps are what was Bane's background or who is this or that character's background. Well honestly, I think that argument is nonsense. If the plot of the show is reveal right at the spot, what's the point of watching already? It's the suspense that made the show exciting and keep viewers at the edge of their seat which is what The Dark Knight Rises did. I don't see the logic of that argument which those critics or user made. Either way, if they are impatient, that's their loss.All in short, a MUST WATCH movie and a guarantee MUST BUY DVD when it comes out.",10,1,6,22 July 2012
The Greatest Showman," Undoubtedly the Best Musical film I seen from Hollywood
","I have to admit, when I first saw the critic's ratings on IMDB and rotten tomatoes, I was put back on watching this film. But what I also realize was the drastic difference between the users and critic's scores which prompted me to watch the film to judge it on my own and I'm glad it did.The soundtracks in this film is truly amazing and is without a doubt the best musical I seen from Hollywood (in my opinion). And Hugh Jackman was simply astounding in this film. In fact, everyone in this film was truly amazing especially Keala Settle who is playing the 'Bearded Lady'. The only real con that this film has was the way it was executed. From what I read from some of the critic's review, the most common criticism thrown was the lack of character development which yes it was true, there wasn't much. But it was because the film was done in way where the flow of the story was base on the soundtracks. Simply put, it's like a Broadway musical. Other criticism like people saying this isn't the actual story of P.T. Barnum or some critics diss the movie just because they don't like the real-life character P.T. Barnum is just idiotic.To sum it up, go and watch the 'The Greatest Showman', you won't regret it. But watch it like a fun loose representation of P.T. Barnum story mad into a musical.",9,1,3,7 January 2018
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Best Comedy show of 2012 and best of the whole Madagascar series
","It's been 7 years since the first Madagascar show and without doubt, the show has constantly improve without fail. One thing which I am truly amaze is that this series could actually keep in touch with it's comedy without losing it especially since most comedy series tends to die down as it continues. A good example to give is 'Shrek'. It started all funny and nice, but as it progresses to 'Shrek 2', comedy starts to die down and it hit rock bottom with 'Shrek the Third'. No doubt 'Shrek Forever After' did better than 'Shrek The Third' but overall, the whole series lose it's roots. Which is why to me, this show deserves this 10 out of 10 rating as not only did it keep to its roots, but it improves it tremendously from the first to the second one. One thing I like most about this show is the balance of both child like comedy with adult humor and also, with some dirty jokes here and there. With all this elements together, it makes the show prefect. And the romance of Gia and Alex or King Julien with the grizzly bear was indeed hilarious and interesting. To sum it all, a MUST SEE comedy show and it will definitely be worth the money to buy the DVD when it comes out.",10,1,3,29 June 2012
