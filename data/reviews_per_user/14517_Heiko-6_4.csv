Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a popcorn beginning of the saga...
","I saw E1 last night. I think it is a well made, technically brilliant movie for children. But where has the magic, the big feelings and the esprit of the 'original' SW-Films gone? You really think you are watching a very long demo-version of a new PC-Game. Finally I'd say the biggest differnce between E1 and E4-6 is, that the effects are playing the major role in E1, instead the great characters of E4-6. But I hope in Episode 3 (this shall be the darkest one) we will see a little bit more of a mature movie! For a normal movie I'd give it a 8 out of 10. For the long awaited Star Wars Episode 1 I give it a 6 out of 10.",Null,0,1,20 August 1999
American History X," Everybody talks about the bad white man...
","...but think about all the black racists! Nobody cares about this (maybe even bigger) problem. I think racism isn't good at BOTH SIDES! So if you fight against racism, fight against all kinds of it.This is a great movie, because it shows that all people of all colors are victims in their own way. Watch it and you will love it.",10,0,0,8 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," ALWAYS THE SAME...
","A well made movie, probably the best effects, but schematically the same good-guys vs bad-guys WWII-film as usual. Yes,Mr.Spielberg, all of us Germans are evil. Yes Mr.Spielberg, we love to kill. THIS IS SO RIDICULOUS, MR.SPIELBERG!!! Only because one Mr.Hitler gained Power for just 23 Years in German history, we will probably see movies like that for the next thousand years. Everybody knows what happened, everybody of us sees it and hears it day by day. We all know it was wrong and horrible, but ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Leave us alone with your one-sided point of view. Many young men died - Russians, Americans, Italians, French, Germans, Australians, English, Japanese and so on.Every one of them had his dreams. Every one of them had his good and bad sides.  Every one of'em had a mother. Every mother cried the same tears. I think it is a shame to say one's death is good and the other's death is bad, only because of the nationality. That is the same thinking like the Nazis had. Good nationality means life, bad nationality means death. Too bad, another wasted chance to show an objective anti-war picture, where all young men are the same ---> VICTIMS OF IDEOLOGY!",Null,3,6,21 September 1999
Platoon," The destiny of young boys sent into the jungle war...
","This movie shows very well the feeling, most Vietnam combat soldiers must have had. You never know, who is your friend and who is your enemy. Every second you can be shot out of a bush. What a bad feeling it must be! Too bad there aren't that many Vietnam movies anymore.",Null,0,0,18 August 1999
