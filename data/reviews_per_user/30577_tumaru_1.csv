Requiem for a Dream," my absolute favorite movie
","The movie is about drugs and how they ruin your dreams, not like that commercial where the kid has a little weed and blows off his head, the hard stuff that is actually addicting. Throughout the movie people get protrade in a very real light. This is no stupid would never happen movie, it is a happens millions of times a day type of movie.It does get a little too real at times and made me wish that this was some horrible piece of fiction but it is far too real. I wish that the world didn't have the dark little corners like this that aren't really corners, their more like most of the room making the lighted bits seem very bright.The movie is definitely my favorite, and I don't like picking favorites or even making a top list its more like there is 'Requiem For A Dream' then there is everything else. Although you do have to have a strong stomach for it. Even the music is really good, I own the CD but haven't found a good copy of the movie to buy, nobody around stocks the full version. I also believe that everybody, with a strong stomach and who would care, should watch this.Oh and don't take my word for it, go out and rent it. Plus I don't normally agree with age restrictions but this is a definite 15+, 14 pushing it. However it is entirely your decision.",10,0,1,1 August 2005
