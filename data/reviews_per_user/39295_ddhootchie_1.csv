Sucker Punch," Very Good - well done and a great fantasy
","You HAVE to understand what you are getting into before seeing this movie - read the synopsis written here by Anonymous - it is very good. IF you don't realize this movie is about a girl tormented by her stepfather who has thrown her in an asylum to be disposed of - you won't get it. The movie is fantastical which is what it claims. There isn't much more to it than the visual representation of the imagination of a girl who has been sentenced to die as she imagines and dreams of a way out. The director and cinematics are both very good. The action is great and remember - its a fantasy, and a tragedy... but a very good movie - I rate it an 8, and would see it a second time.",8,2,6,30 March 2011
