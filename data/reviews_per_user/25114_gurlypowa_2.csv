10 Cloverfield Lane," where was the twist??!
","I was so excited to watch this movie because of the glowing reviews by users as well as critics, many saying that there is a 'surprise' ending. Well, it's not really a surprise when half way through the movie Howard suggests it might be aliens, and it IS aliens. I was expecting something like, Emmett was actually an alien, so comes back to life and kills them both.So we get to see the alien in the last 10 minutes of the movie. It picks up the car with Michelle in it, and instead of killing her instantly, it holds her up there, while she's got a Molotov cocktail flaming in her hand for a good 20 seconds or so, so she can time it perfectly and throw it into it's mouth. seriously, why is this alien just staring at her with it's mouth opening and closing? The only good thing about the movie was the acting. glad I didn't watch it in theatres.",4,8,17,6 April 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," 8.7?? first time i've disagreed with other users.
","well this is coming from a girl who loves playing games like Resident Evil, Call of Duty, and Dead Space so i wouldn't consider myself a girly girl. The movie reminded me a lot of Ghosts of Mars, and Death Race, both of which i liked marginally better. The guitar guy needed to be the first one to die because he was giving me a headache. the plot could be summed up in one sentence. (i wont give spoilers). I love action movies... but this movie had maybe 3 minutes of hand to hand combat (this scene wasn't even very good), and the rest was a car chase. ONE LONG CAR CHASE. at least Furious 7 had nice looking cars! these cars were dirty and ugly, which pretty much describes the every character and costume in the movie. The scenery wasn't pretty either... just wasteland. If I'm going to watch something with no plot it needs to be pretty mind blowing otherwise. The action in it wasn't even intense.. just lots of vehicles blowing up. Like throwing exploding spears into adjacent vehicles. I was bored of exploding vehicles 15min into the action. No real INTENSE moments (remember Furious 7 when Paul Walker was hanging out of the back of a truck that was hanging off a cliff and he had to run up and jump onto Letti's car?THAT WAS INTENSE!)the main character Max had maybe 50 words for the whole movie. there were also a lot of 'eew gross' moments which were pretty unnecessary.. (like the mothers milk... what the heck was that all about). Hubby didn't like the movie either and this is a guy who thinks Mortal Kombat, Heavy Metal and the Rocky Horror Picture Show are the best movies ever made. I usually go by IMDb user ratings when i go watch a show and this is the first time I've disagreed with the rest of the users. for a movie to get over 8/10 it has to be captivating to virtually all viewers (eg Lord of the Rings Trilogy). We went as a group of 2 males and 2 females and none of us liked it.",5,19,39,30 May 2015
