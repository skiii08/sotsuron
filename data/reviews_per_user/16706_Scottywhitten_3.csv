The Blair Witch Project," A truly chilling film
","This movie in my opinion is one of the creepier films i have seen. The directors really bring you into the situation which the characters are in. Throughout the film as the characters become more terrified you feel the same sense of fear as they are. You feel as if you are actually with the characters as they are put in these situations of terror.What I really loved about this movie is you are able to be scared by something you don't even see. Thats the secret to this film, the sense that you are unsure of what is truly going on out in the pitch black forest while you watch and listen to the sounds which are being made by this unknown creature. This film will creep under your skin and leave you thinking about it days after seeing it.8.5/10",Null,0,1,21 July 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," A stunning piece of art which boggles the mind
","The use of music in this film is like no other film which i have seen. It gives the movie a beautiful atmosphere and almost gives you the feeling of floating in space yourself. The effects are also good in this movie considering the time it was made. Besides all of the effects and music it is a very well directed and well acted film. Kubrick takes this already interesting novel and turns it into a mind blowing, suspenseful, and sometimes terrifying piece of art which all comes together in the end.So I would recommend this movie to all the free thinkers out there who appreciate good directing.8/10",Null,0,2,21 July 2004
Donnie Darko," a few steps away from a masterpiece
","This movie has many interesting concepts of what is really going on in the universe around us. It also does a good job showing how complicated life really is and how it can't be summed up into two factors (love and hate).This film revolves around a troubled teenager named Donnie Darko who is constantly having nightmares where he is visited by a horrific giant rabbit named Frank. Frank tells him in a very monotoned voice that the world is going to end in about a month. After hearing this information Donnie gradually tries to understand what is going on in the world around and also the world inside him.Now this movie does have its fare share of possotives but it does have some negatives. One of which is there are a few unanswered questions left behind. Now i don't mean unanswered questions which are left to you to come up with the answer, i mean unanswered questions where there is no answer (one example: why were the bullies hanging out in grandma deaths cellar late at night with knives). Another problem is that there is a few to many characters in this piece. In the end there is a purpose for each character though, but i still felt the film could have been just as good by leaving a few out. The final problem i saw in watching this film is some of the dialogue was not very believable (and this is coming from someone in the same age group as Donnie). Don't get me wrong a lot of the scenes have very well put together dialogue which make you think and at the same time take you into Donnies mind and show what he's thinking, but sometimes there scenes which to me are very fake and lame (one example: The first bus stop scene).Now don't get me wrong i did enjoy this film, it's just that there are some flaws i felt i should point out. In the end though the positives out way the negatives to this dark thrill ride. This is a very well shot movie and will keep you on edge of your seat the entire way through. I will recommend this movie to anyone who actually enjoys thinking while they watch a movie.8/10",Null,0,1,22 July 2004
