The Incredible Hulk," You've seen it done better a million times before
","Unlike the other reviewers here I was REALLY disappointed with this film. Admittedly I felt similarly disappointed after seeing Ang Lee's take on the big green monster - but that was my fault for having 'traditional' expectations going in. That earlier film improved with subsequent viewings, and at least had a sense of originality going for it.I'm a fan of Ed Norton's work, and so was looking forward to his take on things, particularly when it was announced he was writing the script and would be concentrating on the Banner character and his inner psyche.Alas, the endless reports of a troubled shoot, culminating with Norton's name being removed from the writing credits of the film earlier this week by the WGA set off alarm bells that have proved all too true.This is a lazy, formulaic, 'do it by numbers' mess of a superhero film. It's not a patch on 'Iron Man' which was Marvel's first 'in house' production, and it suffers terribly when compared to that offering. When the standout sequence is a rehash of the rooftop scene already done (and to much better effect) in Bourne Ultimatum you know you're in trouble.Ed Norton is, unfortunately, totally miscast in this take on Bruce Banner. He's far too bland to command leading man status. The action scenes are tired and lifeless, with poor fire FX and some terrible 'eye line' work on the CGI. Only the end scene fight between The Hulk and The Abomination look vaguely convincing. And it's the sort of fight scene that we've seen endless times before in other, better superhero movies.Other missteps include having Mr Blue (Samuel) playing everything for laughs, and the complete lack of a proper ending. The fight scene ends and then the makers don't know what to do. In fact the ending is so bad they end up having to add the same coda they added to 'Iron Man', but this time before the credits. Lame, lame, lame! Kids will enjoy this, and I guess it's truer to the comic book than Ang Lee's take was. But really it just comes across as a 'between series' TV episode expanded out with a movie budget. There's nothing new here and Bill Bixby did it better on TV.I'd be surprised if there's a sequel. And if there is I hope it's a whole lot better than this mess.",5,31,97,9 June 2008
Brokeback Mountain," A movie that's hard to forget
","My initial thoughts on leaving the cinema were of slight disappointment given all the 'hype'. Despite attending a 'preview' screening before the new year (in the UK where the movie has only just been released) the screen quality was poor (dusty and out of focus). I'd also expected more 'chemistry' between the two leads but with the benefit of hindsight I guess I was just expecting more overt 'gay'ness, which really isn't what this movie is about. In the two weeks since I saw it, the subtleties of it keep coming back to haunt me and the little touches that are all the way through it suddenly come back to me. I've come to realise that the chemistry between the two leads is there and true to the characters. The movie is over two hours long and as someone who is still complaining about the three hours of my life wasted watching King Kong that I'll never get back (there was a really good 90 minute movie in there somewhere that got lost in poor dialogue and over-indulgence and some pretty ropey effects work) that isn't something I'd regard as a good thing normally. 90-100 minutes is as longs as should be needed to tell a story. But this movie is different. It takes its time, particularly in the first hour, but that's what makes it so powerful in the second half. It leaves you wanting more, looking at your watch wondering where the time went. The acting is superb from ALL those involved, minor and major characters, but if I had to single out any actor I'd agree with those who think this is a 'career best' performance for Ledger as Ennis. He is outstanding, and bear in mind this is a comment coming from someone who'd dismissed the actor because of what appeared to be rather homophobic remarks he'd made about not being gay himself. If this movie doesn't win a whole bunch of Oscars for direction, for acting, for the score, for the cinematorgraphy.... there's no justice in the world.Bottom line: It's not a 'feel good' movie but it's one that you won't forget. Go and see it! NB: Unlike the other ecstatic reviewers I've given it a 9 rather than a 10 (10 means it just couldn't have been any better, but I thought the ageing of the characters wasn't very convincing which marked it down). Don't let that lack of a 10 put you off. I generally wait for a movie on DVD but I went to the cinema to see this and despite the poor viewing experience because of the poor cinema facilities I will probably go and see it again before the DVD comes out (but at a different cinema). Until I saw this 'Crash' was my favourite movie of 2005. 'Crash' just became my second favourite movie of 2005. Enough said!",9,8,10,8 January 2006
Pitch Black," Predictable but above average sci-fi thriller
","Despite the limited budget the makers managed to pull off a film that had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. Comparison with movies like 'Alien' are inevitable, but this is different enough to warrant investigation. The characters were all fundamentally flawed and irritating in their own ways but then life's often like that! The aliens were handled well - getting better with each appearance. Acting and cinematographic effects were excellent and the ending wasn't quite as predictable as I'd expected. Recommended.",7,0,0,3 June 2001

Pearl Harbor," Cliched and schmalzy, but nowhere near as bad as Titanic!
",The plot's thin and predictable. The history laughable. But the movie is nowhere near as bad as many of the critics have made out. The cinematography is stunning. The central war scenes amazing (not as good as Private Ryan but overall I felt this was a better film!) The acting is nowhere near as bad as some of made out (although it's a shame that the humour of the Affleck character at the start of the movie seems to get dumped for no apparent reason after initial scenes have been set). And the music is so catchy I found myself browsing the local record store straight after the movie for the soundtrack.I certainly didn't come out of the movie feeling 'that was a waste of a tenner'. Which is more than can be said for many recent Hollywood releases.,7,0,0,2 June 2001
300," Awesome, breath-taking film.
","I somehow missed the hype on this one, and the trailer really didn't excite me, but I got a chance to see an advance screening and the other reviewer here who said 'It blew me away' hit the nail right on the head.I generally hate going to the cinema - preferring to wait until the DVD or HD-DVD are available because I'm fed up of shoddy prints, poor sound systems, ignorant members of the public with their ringing phones, late arrivals, noisy popcorn etc. My home system is so much better. But not for this movie! It needs to be seen on the big screen (preferably an Imax - I'm hoping to catch it a second time on IMAX) with a good sound system. The images are consistently breath-taking, the sound is staggeringly good and note-perfect throughout, and Gerard Butler is barely recognisable as the guy from 'Dear Frankie' (a great, under-rated movie) and 'Phantom of the Opera'.Highly recommended. I've given it a 9, and I don't think I've given a movie that high a score for over a year (and I average about 6 movies a week). This makes 'Gladiator' look like a cheap kid's cartoon.",9,802,1583,15 February 2007
