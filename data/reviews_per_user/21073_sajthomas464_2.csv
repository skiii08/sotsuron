Hereditary," Worst movie ever!
","Well i started watching the movie thinking it would just a good horror movie. But as it turns out, it just one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life and I have seen a whole lot of movies. It is not even worth watching the one time and it is a very disappointing movie. Hence my rating is 1/10.",1,2,4,12 June 2020
Blade Runner," Boring
","This is one of the most boring and worst movies i've ever seen. Believe me when i say that DONT watch this movie. As a movie lover, i absolutely hated the movie. The whole movie is just about a few replicants who do not have a life expectancy as humans due and want to live longer. Not an impressive plot and underwhelming scenes. So very boring.It takes 5-10 minutes to just to move on from a scene or dialogue and even to go the next room. My rating: 1/10. Just hope the new blade runner is better.",1,3,7,18 April 2020
