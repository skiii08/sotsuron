The Avengers," Exceeds Expectations
","The Avengers has gotten a lot of praise, much of which it rightly deserves, but the plot is somewhat uninspired. It's your classic comic- book movie formula with an evil villain who wants to take over the Earth and a team of superheroes is the only thing that stands in his way. But that isn't really what the film is about anyway. The presence of the evil villain merely serves as a means to an end; in this case the end being the assembly of the Avengers, an event the previous films have all been leaving up to. And while the plot is predictable and could have been a lot more innovative, the way the characters are brought together is handled masterfully.This brings me to the actors, and the cast in the Avengers is superb. Uniting the cast of all the independent previous films, with the exception of Edward Norton who was sadly unable to reprise his role from the Incredible Hulk (2008), the Avengers consists of an all star cast whose performances are definitely largely the reason why this film is so good.The main reason, however, for the Avengers being the success that it is is the director. Joss Whedon was the perfect choice for this film for one reason above all others; he has the talent to create a fantastic on- screen chemistry between characters with very different lifestyles. While seeing Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans) having an argument is a terrific crossover moment on its own, Whedon's sense for chemistry really makes scenes such as this stand out where others might fail to do so.Combining this with fast paced, intense action scenes with amazing special effects makes for a visual thrill ride, however Whedon also never forgets what the film is really about; these superheroes from across space and time coming together to fight a common enemy.The result: a well balanced, well paced blockbuster that also has a lot of heart. And for me this more than makes up for the superficial plot, especially considering the amount of work, time and money Marvel has invested in these films, making sure everything ties in and adds up, all leading up to this.When it first came out, a lot of people were afraid that the Avengers could not live up to the expectations raised by the other films. In my opinion, not only does it live up to the expectations, it exceeds them.You won't be disappointed by this film, however I strongly recommend you watch the other films first to really be able to appreciate the masterpiece that the entire series is.",9,1,4,1 June 2013
Skyfall," Great film but not really Bond
","The plot is pretty good, although there are some minor holes in it. To keep this review spoiler-free I won't go too much into the details. James Bond films have never been known for the quality of their plots, but it's obvious that in Skyfall they wanted to change that, so I think it is a shame that they took a few short cuts too many. Other then that it is a great, emotionally charged piece of writing. The acting is first rate. Daniel Craig, while -as many people have remarked in the past- not looking the part, does a great job at playing an older, hardened Bond. Judi Dench is amazing as M, and she really gets to show her talent due to M having a much bigger role in this film than in it's predecessors. Javier Bardem makes for an interesting villain. A touch too flamboyant for my taste, but he gets the job done really well.The Directing is really where Skyfall stands out. Sam Mendes has already proved himself to be a fantastic cinematic director in the past, and Skyfall only serves as more proof. It may have helped that he has worked with most of the stars in the past, but also the pacing and atmosphere in the film are expertly crafted.As for the cinematography; Skyfall blew me away. Fantastic compositions and brilliant use of colors that even Ridley Scott could learn from make Skyfall a treat for the eyes.So all in all Skyfall is a good film. But Skyfall isn't just any film, it's a Bond film and certain special standards apply to Bond films. When people hear James Bond they think mind boggling stunts, pretty girls, fast cars and crazy villains. Well Skyfall delivers on all of these fronts, however very briefly.The stunts are mind boggling, yes, especially considering that, as opposed to the last few films, there was almost no CGI involved in creating them. However most of the stunts and action occur in the first 10 minutes, allowing the rest of the film to get on with the plot. While normally this would be a good thing, more avid Bond fans may be disappointed by the lack of action.The same is true for the girls. There is a lot of eye-candy in the film, but Bond hardly gets to spend any time with them before he gets whisked away again by the plot. As for the villain, he's just the right amount of crazy and having a Bond villain on a personal vendetta instead of just being out for money or power certainly makes for an interesting change.It all comes down to this. Skyfall is definitely a fantastic film and definitely worth watching, but in my opinion it just isn't Bond. As stated earlier, all the classic Bond elements get drowned out by the plot and therefore may leave some fans mildly disappointed.",8,0,2,1 June 2013
Saw III," How the Saw franchise got it's reputation
","Jigsaw is dying and his apprentice, introduced in the previous film, kidnaps a doctor to try and save his life. The doctor is promised that she can go free if she keeps Jigsaw alive though one of his games. The game revolves around a man who is given a chance to save the life of the man responsible for the death of his son.This time the game is only secondary to the plot. The film is really about the drama between Jigsaw, the apprentice and the doctor. There aren't as many twists as in the earlier ones, although there is quite a powerful and unexpected revelation at the end.Sadly the plot is almost literally drowned out by the blood and gore factor. They completely ignored the concept of psycho horror and tension and went for over the top graphic violence purely for the shock value. However after about the third disembowelment it stops being shocking and becomes disgusting and repulsive.One thing I neglected to mention in my earlier Saw reviews is the soundtrack. The music throughout is fairly generic horror background music, but the theme that plays during the big revelation at the end is impressive and combined with crisp editing it ensures a powerful hair raising moment of realization at each film's climax. By the third movie I found myself looking forward to this scene.The acting suffers from the same problem as number two. Jigsaw and his apprentice are really good, but the other characters are shallow and unrelatable. Whether the fault lies in the script or the acting or both, I found myself bored of the secondary drama as well as disgusted by the graphic nature of the film.Saw 3 is definitively the weakest so far, not that you can expect something different from a second horror sequel. There is almost no tension and a superfluous amount of blood and gore. In my opinion it is worth enduring for the twist at the end, but unless you have a strong stomach and/or are a fan of the series I recommend you skip this one.",6,0,0,1 June 2013
Batman Begins," A breath of fresh air
","When it first came out I assumed it was intended as a prequel to the already existing Batman film series started off by Tim Burton's Batman (1989) . Only with the release of the later films did it dawn on me that this was an entirely new and independent take on Batman.The plot, as the title suggests, revolves on the origin of Batman, how Bruce Wayne learns to overcome his fears to fight evil. It is quite straight forward, but that's fine with an origin story. There is a twist at the end, but not a very good one. Definitely one of those 'Curse you sudden but inevitable betrayal!' moments. The acting is amazing, with an all star cast including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, not much needs to be said here.Nolan does a great job directing. He keeps you interested throughout Wayne's training up the point where he finally becomes Batman. He manages to weave a strong thematic element of overcoming your fears into it, from Waynes struggle with his fear of bats to the antagonist Scarecrow using peoples fears against them.Considering the last two installments in the previous series, Batman Begins is a welcome breath of fresh air and does a fine job of reviving the franchise while adding a new spin to it. I am quite fond of Nolan's approach. Tim Burton's vision was of a more surreal Gotham, while Nolan goes for a very realistic 'crime drama' of sorts. For this reason it is impossible to compare this film to Tim Burton's. They are both very good films and I can only recommend you watch both and decide for yourself who's vision you like more.",7,0,1,1 June 2013
Saw II," Not as good as the original
","Saw 2 lacks a lot of the tension of the first one, the jump moments aren't as effective and the pacing is a little slow. Tobin Bell, who plays Jigsaw is really good. They gave the character a lot more depth and he is really convincing and even relatable. Sadly this cannot be said for the other characters, who are all rather shallow and uninteresting. The key to good horror is to make the protagonists relatable so that the audience cares about what happens to them. Now perhaps I'm just a sick, twisted person, but the only character I really found myself caring about is the killer.This brings me to my next point. While the original Saw was definitely a psychological piece, the sequel already started going more for the gore. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and with the same twisted editing and cinematographic techniques they used in the first one it works quite well.Saw 2 had a much higher budget than the first one, a larger cast and better production value, but they sacrificed a lot of the tight direction and tension that made the original great. Also this film is more graphic than it's predecessor, so consider yourself warned. However it is worth watching just to learn more about the Jigsaw character.",6,0,0,1 June 2013
The Dark Knight," Complex and brilliant
","Where do I begin? The plot is, in my opinion, something of a mess. It's not so much incoherent as that there is just way too much going on at the same time. The film is long and it definitely needs it's time to fully tell the story, but it is a little overpowering. The film mainly revolves around Batman's fight against the Joker, but there is all kinds of other stuff going on as well. From a love triangle between the main characters to a mob conspiracy to Harvey Dent's fall from grace. Nolan does a good enough job of interweaving all these elements, but it is just a little too cluttered for my taste. My complaint with Batman Begins was that the plot was too straight forward and predictable, in this it is the exact opposite.Aside from that, however, this is a brilliant film. The whole thing is very well paced considering the amount of story to tell. The acting is superb, with the all star cast of Batman Begins returning for the second installment, joined by Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger for this film, the latter doing a fantastic job as the Joker.I could go on and on to list everything that is good about this film, but suffice it to say that if you haven't seen it yet you have to get your hands on it.",9,0,1,1 June 2013
Saw," Great psycho-horror movie
","Overall the plot is quite solid and there are several very satisfying twists along the way. The dialogue is fairly well written and the characterization is good. The villain's motivation is a little shallow, but remains plausible. Also some of the secondary characters could have used a bit more depth, especially as some of them are more important to the plot than they appear at first glance.Not much can be said about the acting. The then not so well known actors play the parts convincingly and the drama is believable.Saw has gained a reputation for being a blood soaked gorefest not for the faint of heart. This reputation may be true for the sequels, but surprisingly the first one is quite harmless. This is really a film in the psycho horror genre, most of the violence is suggested or occurs off screen. The horror is brought on through the power of suggestion and the fact that it is disturbingly realistic.The direction is well paced and the film carries some serious tension with a few genuine jump moments. This is only enhanced by the cinematography and the editing, both executed in an original way to ensure a very unnerving and twisted viewing experience.Saw did not have the highest of budgets, but it is one of those films where the lack of production value is compensated by a good script and solid directing. Aside from the odd cheesy or gruesome moments I can definitely recommend this film.",8,0,1,1 June 2013
Thor," One of Marvel's best
","First off I was never aware Marvel had made a comic out of the Norse mythology, and after doing some research into the franchise I learned why. Suffice it to say 'The Mighty Thor' is not one of their best characters. The film is about a race of aliens living on the planet Asgard, who have a history of war with the so called Ice Giants from a nearby planet. Odin, the king of the Asgard who defeated the Ice Giants is dying and his son Thor is set to replace him. However, as Thor is about to become king, a group of Ice Giants infiltrates Asgard in order to steal some weapon or other. Odin stops them, but Thor wants revenge and goes to the Ice Giant's home world to challenge them. The resulting confrontation almost unleashes another war between the planets, but Thor's father intervenes just in time. As punishment for almost starting a war Thor is banished to Earth, where he has to live among humans as a mortal.If you know a thing or two about Norse mythology you will of course recognize a lot of the themes in this film. King Odin, the Halls of Asgard and of course the thunder-god Thor with his hammer, which also has a prominent presence in the film. While this all sounds rather cheap, far fetched and ridiculous, the writing is surprisingly good. The dialogue is strong and the mix of humor and tension is executed nicely. Most of the characters are strong, albeit only the main ones. The side parts, such as Thor's team of warriors, would have more personality if they were replaced by cardboard cut-outs.The acting is also, frankly, quite superb. Chris Hemsworth plays the part of the arrogant warrior prince very convincingly, Natalie Portman is great as the love interest and Anthony Hopkins is as good as ever in his role as Odin. However Tom Hiddleston, who plays Thor's evil brother Loki, really steals the show in my opinion. He is given a well developed character to work with and he does it very well.I was surprised to hear that Kenneth Branagh was directing. Needless to say he did a good job. Being a super hero movie most of it is action, but there are enough quiet scenes to give us a rest from all the running around and screaming and these are also handled very well. The art direction is superb, there are glorious alien vista's and incredible special effects, even if everything is CGI.To me Thor was a surprising film. The first half hour or so, with all this stuff about Asgard and all the fancy visual effects and not much proper story I found myself thinking that I was watching a cheap, no brains, action movie with no real depth. Just as I started to think that the film seemed to spin 180 degrees and turn into what I now see as a surprisingly good feature. With an all star cast, stunning visuals and good story telling, Thor is definitely one of Marvel's best.",7,1,2,1 June 2013
Prometheus," Disappointing
","I suppose I'll start with the plot, at least in so far as Prometheus has a plot. There are holes big enough to drive a tractor through. The most frequent problem is that throughout the film either things happen for no reason whatsoever or that the characters come to conclusions without any real reason to. An example of this, without spoiling it for you, is a scene where one of the main characters goes through a very grueling surgical ordeal, only to come out the other side, covered in blood, and be completely ignored by the other characters as well as the plot. Another example is a character who spends the entire film doing next to nothing to contribute, yet somehow towards the end he magically knows exactly what is going on. I can't even begin to sum up the sheer amount or holes in the plot, suffice it to say there are a lot.As for the characters, if you can call them that; I can draw stick figures with better personalities. One of the crew is a robot, but in my opinion they might as well all have been robots for the sheer lack of emotion and growth they showed.The acting is reasonable, given the material the actors were given they did a competent job. I sensed there was a lot of ad libbing going on, most likely desperate attempts by the actors to squeeze a few drops of personality out of their cardboard cutout characters.So the writing is mediocre at best, what about the directing? This is where Prometheus salvages itself. Scott is a competent director, even if the script he was working with was a more horrible abomination than any of the monsters in the film. The tension is first rate, and despite all the holes he manages to still keep you wanting more. As for the visuals, if you have seen any of Scott's other films (Ailen, Blade Runner, Gladiator, etc.) you should know by now that Ridley Scott is very much a visual director. The cinematography is amazing, and the stunning visuals alone are reason enough to watch this film.So is Prometheus worth watching? I have to say when I left the cinema the first and only thing in my mind was: What did it all mean? And that wasn't just because of the bad writing, but by the questions raised by the film overall, and a film that makes you think and try to interpret it afterwards is a good film, regardless of its flaws. Therefore, in my opinion, Prometheus is worth watching. However there is a lot of wasted potential here. Going in I thought: this is a prequel to the Alien franchise, by the creator nonetheless, he couldn't possibly go wrong. Little did I know that Scott had gone full George Lucas on it. Perhaps my expectations were too high.Whatever the case may be, I can recommend you watch Prometheus, just don't expect too much from it.",6,2,3,1 June 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," One of the best Batman films yet
","I went to see the Dark Knight Rises last week and I have to say I was impressed. Story-wise it's a lot better than it's predecessors. The plot is coherent and has several interesting twists along the way that I won't spoil for you here. My only complaint is that it is a bit heavy going at some points. 3 hours is a long time, and I wouldn't go so far as to say boring, but it definitely takes a while to pick up the pace. However once it does you are in for a thrill ride.Nolan did a fantastic job with the Characters, from the troubled Bruce Wayne/Batman to Catwoman to the antagonist Bane, as well as secondary characters such as Alfred and Gordon, they are all fleshed out beautifully and are very believable in respect to the source material. Supplemented by superb acting by the all star cast, I have no complaints here.The direction is fantastic. As I said above, it takes a while to pick up, but it never ever get's boring. As soon as you start to think that, something happens that pulls you right back in. Nolan deserves to be commended for this. The action scenes are brilliantly done, the special effects are great, Hans Zimmer's score is, as always, superb, the editing and cinematography are crisp. There really is not much to complain about here. In my personal opinion it is the best installment in the Nolan trilogy, and if you haven't seen it yet I can only recommend you do so as soon as possible.",8,6,10,1 June 2013
Cube," Amazing original concept
","Cube is a low budget Canadian psychological horror film about a group of strangers who wake up in a mysterious cube shaped room with no recollection of how they got there. On each wall, ceiling and floor there are doors leading to identical adjacent rooms. They soon find out that some rooms have deadly traps in them and as a result they are killed off one by one as they make their way through the cube searching for a way out until there are only a few left.The plot is fairly straightforward and there are no major twists. While the concept of strangers waking up in a horrible place is not exactly original in the horror genre, the setting is well thought out and the viewer is kept longing for answers about the nature of the cube and who is responsible for it. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, but it is delivered well by the actors. The characters are a little on the two dimensional side and could have used a bit more exploring.The acting in cube is convincing. Stars David Hewlett and Nicole De Boer went on to make quite a name for themselves in the science fiction genre, but it is interesting to see them in an early low budget film.The direction in cube is superb. The tension is held throughout as the characters slowly go insane. Clever use is made of the limited production value. The whole film is shot on one set, the cube room. Each room is the same set, only lit differently and through clever use of cinematography and editing the characters' journey from room to room is believable.Overall cube is a very good film. Again a film where a strong script and good direction compensates for lack of extensive sets and flashy special effects. Cube is one of those films where, when it's finished, you find yourself asking for more. I definitely recommend checking this one out.",8,1,4,1 June 2013
Moon," Brilliant Original Sci-Fi
","Moon is a recent, comparatively low budget, independent science fiction film set in the not too distant future about a man whose job it is to mine the fuel helium 3 on the moon. His only companion is the intelligent robot GERTY (who bares a striking resemblance to HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey). However it soon transpires that even on the moon not all is as it seems. I don't want to spoil it too much for you, but suffice it to say he is definitely not alone.The writing in Moon is good, the character(s) have depth and the dialogue is spot on. There are many twists and turns along the way and it raises quite a few moral issues.The acting is also superb. Sam Rockwell plays the protagonist and he is very believable, especially as he (Spoilers) spends most of the film acting against himself which is very hard to pull off convincingly. Kevin Spacey is also good as the voice of GERTY.Moon was the directorial debut for Duncan Jones and he did a fantastic job. The film has a tense atmosphere throughout. The cinematography is amazing, especially the space shots. The editing is a bit bitty at times, but the film remains easy to follow.This is a brilliant film, it is nice to see the science fiction genre can still deliver something original. The fact that it had a low budget and it is the director's first feature film only make it more impressive. I can definitely recommend this one.",9,3,8,1 June 2013
