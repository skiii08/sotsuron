Lucky Number Slevin," Surprisingly very entertaining
","Lucky Number Slevin is a surprise of a film- It takes from the best, namely Hitchcock and Tarantino in its approach to writing and directing and boy is it a ride. Keeping things unpredictable and breezy Lucky Number Slevin is a riot of a movie. The acting from everyone from Josh Hartnett, Bruce Willis, Lucy Lui to old veterans like Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley is great- you know they're all having fun. You should too- go see it.",Null,0,0,9 October 2018
The Elephant Man," Tough but artistically enriching experience
",David Lynch is a tough act to get into and The Elephant Man is perhaps his most mainstream work. But even a mainstream Lynch film is abstract and The Elephant Man- based on the true story of John Merrick is filled with imagery and allegories that might bore the watcher. Make no mistake- this is a good movie and the performance of John Hurt as the titular character is so good I think it's a joke he did not win an academy award for it. Hauntingly photographed and well acted by everyone from Anthony Hopkins to Anne Bankcroft this is an artistic film and needs a certain mindset to be viewed.,Null,0,3,20 July 2018
Eyes Wide Shut," Already a classic? I think it is
","Eyes Wide Shut is a work of high authority and one can see Kubrick's influence in each frame. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman play real life couple in high society New York(completely recreated on a London soundstage). They are invited a party where sexual dealings and offerings are exchanged which leads to an altercations of sorts later at home. What follows is a ride into a rabbit hole by Cruise's character involving sex cults, orgies, identities and obsessions. The film isn't as heavy handed as it appears and the pacing is very good. Worth a watch.",Null,0,0,26 September 2018
