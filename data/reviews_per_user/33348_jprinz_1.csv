Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you're expecting the Star Wars universe to be unraveled before your eyes, prepare to be disappointed...
","But if you are ready to watch episode 1, you're in for a REAL treat!!!! It doesn't matter what the critics say, they go to a movie to analyze the characters, and the plot, and the settings, and the costumes....honestly, sounds like a real boring job.  I think they've lost touch in what actually makes a good movie.  Star Wars is like a book, incomplete in its separate chapters, exquisite as a whole.  It's about story telling, not about the individual episodes.  And YES, it does seem to be setting up for the next two movies, but duh, if you're just realizing this now, you don't deserve to see, feel, experience the awesome story telling ability of George Lucas. He is able to create a world (and yes, an imaginary world) that most of us simply could not fathom.  The story has just begun, and I for one applaud Mr. Lucas.  Bravo sir Lucas, bravo.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
