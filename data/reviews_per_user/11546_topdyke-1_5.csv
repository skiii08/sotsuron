The Benchwarmers," A movie so horrible, it is only eclipsed in stupidity by future 'Happy Madison' titles
","Few words can accurately describe this film,And most of them would be censored if I were to type them out.I went to see this film against my better judgment, at the behest of a friend who assured me that yes, it was going to be stupid, but that quote 'a mindless laugh is good every once and awhile.'He couldn't have been more wrong. I don't want to sound pretentious, I in fact, do enjoy mindless laughs when they are appropriate. But 'The Benchwarmers' does not provide such pleasureThe overstated humor of 'The Benchwarmers' is not mindless, but mind-sucking, annihilating brain cells at will.It is full of the now run of the mill jokes typical of Happy Madison, endless anatomical references, it overflows with sexual innuendo, and relies almost entirely on the the stupidity of the dialog spoken by Heder and Spade, both of which demonstrate their lack of acting talent.And as expected, it ends with a generic, oversimplified moral, to give the customers some sense of satisfaction.It fails miserably, instead detracting from its already dwindling status of a comedy. Will you laugh occasionally when watching this movie, yes.But they will be laughs of pity, at this sorry excuse for a film. The worst part of it all, is that somehow films like this generate revenue, In fact, 'The Benchwarmers' opened at the number two position at the Box Office. This then only encourages more and more deplorable Sandler/Dugan collaborations, flooding the market with incessant atrocities. Since this movie, we have had the ultimate displeasure to be bombarded by 'I Now Pronounce you Chuck and Larry', and 'You Don't Mess With the Zohan.' With every fiber of my being, I discourage all of you from watching any of these movies. The cheap laughs that are gained are nowhere near enough to make up for the loss of intelligence and dignity you will suffer from paying for such mass-market garbage.Save yourselves",1,2,3,16 June 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," Why, oh why did you leave Bryan Singer?
","The movie series that started the superhero film boom has unfortunately ended on a tragic note.Bryan Singer, the genius behind the delight that was the first two films decided to pull out to focus on his new project 'Superman Returns.'I do respect his decision, especially since 'Superman Returns' was a pretty decent film.But I, like many extremely disgruntled X-Men fans am appalled at how the finale in the trilogy was handled. This installment has ignored the excellent writing of the first two, which was full of witty remarks, and excellent story-telling, and instead has reverted to sensationalist action, without any semblance of a logical plot.The painstaking development of nearly every mutant's character in the first two movies has been shamefully cast aside. New mutants like Juggernaut and Angel are treated very poorly, seemingly only thrown in to showcase their abilities with special effects. Not to mention the fact that Juggernaut looks absolutely ridiculous.The acting by proxy suffers as well. Clearly reluctant performances by Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen as Wolverine and Magneto respectively are obviously just fulfillments of contract obligations. Nightcrawler, who was played by Alan Cumming in the last film has mysteriously, and without explanation disappeared. A tragedy, since Cumming, who redeemed himself from his appearance in 'The Son of the Mask' with a fantastic performance in X2, capturing the isolation and confusion one would expect from such a character.By the ending battle sequence, what little storyline there was is buried beneath overly extravagant special effects and violence.This film is a clear indicator that the right movie in the wrong hands (Brett Ratner) is always, ALWAYS a recipe for absolute cinematic disaster.If only Singer had returned, we fans of this engrossing series would have received the satisfying conclusion we were all aching for after the end of X2.",3,5,6,16 June 2008
There Will Be Blood," A can't miss film
","It is true that the plot does get fuzzy at some points, and the oddities of the story do seem daunting, but overall this film must be seen by anyone who considers themselves a movie buff.'There Will Be Blood' opens with what must be nearly fifteen minutes of a lack of dialog, and yet viewers are drawn in by the unique and highly creative directing style of Paul Thomas Anderson.The main selling point of this movie was Daniel Day Lewis' presence, a rare one, as he may be the most selective big name actor in modern cinema, and he does not disappoint. He exquisitely portrays a man's descent into madness and irrationality at the hands of the ludicrous oil business of the time period. Day Lewis makes you believe his anger, his frustration, his anguish at his son's disability. By the end, his performance is a consummate work of art.But he is not the only reason that this movie is excellent. Paul Dano, who plays the role of Eli Sunday, the passionate but corrupt pastor of the local church, surprises us all with the energy of his acting.The bi-play when both of these actors are on screen simultaneously is gripping. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen during the conflict over what Plainview owes Sunday for the church.The final, and most important reason this film should be seen by all is the gravity of the issues it tackles. Corruption, anger, greed, and the wasteland that humanity is when confronted with limitless financial possibilities. Anderson conveys his message with resounding effectiveness.Overall, yeah, this movie received a lot of hype and fanfare, maybe more than it deserved. But for this day and age, this movie is a masterpiece by comparison to the depravity found in 'You Don't Mess with the Zohan' and others of the like.",8,2,4,16 June 2008
The Terminal," Grossly Underrated
","There is something about this movie that draws me to watching it again and again.In the 2000s era of American movies, we are flooded with cheap teenage exploitation horror films, and the God-awful calamity of recent Adam Sandler 'comedies.'But among them emerges this relatively low budget (for its time period) movie that exudes a feel-good aura, relying on the top quality of its writing, and the performances of Hanks and Zeta-Jones.The defining aspect of this film is Hanks' acting. His versatility as an actor is extraordinary. In 'The Terminal' as he assumes the role of a tourist from the fictional East-European nation of Krakozhia with effortless mastery, down to the accent and mannerisms. As the film progresses, we see the characters develop in ways that are often overlooked in today's cinema. The depth of the acting and writing explores such themes as isolation, anxiety, and hope. Even the performances from the supporting cast are top of the line.You are doing yourself a disservice by not seeing this movie, one that I feel has been buried among the mess of crap-films that we are forced to endure.",8,1,3,16 June 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," Absolutely brilliant, a masterpiece of the 1990s
","The direction, the acting, the writing, absolutely everything about this film is masterful.To start off with, the acting is excellent.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both give what are arguably the performances of their career. Robbins acts with subtlety and understatement, speaking his lines and manipulating his body language with an effortless grace. Freeman's acting and narration are brilliant, in particular his monologue near the end.The direction is some of the best, a surprising and resounding foray into big budget films by Frank Darabont.And of course, the writing is the true shining feature. The creativity of the story, and the twists that give us the ultimate satisfaction are rarities among modern American films.This movie, is unquestionably one of the best films of the 1990s, and perhaps one of the best that has ever been made",10,0,1,16 June 2008
