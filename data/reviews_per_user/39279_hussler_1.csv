Requiem for a Dream," FOR BETTER OR WORSE, THIS FILM WILL AFFECT YOU.
","All I can say is that this film has some of the best editing and visual giggery-pokery that I have EVER seen. It also has one of the most striking scores, which seems to compliment the action so well. It is one of the most enthralling movies ever. As others have noted, it is bleak and depressing, but isn't that the way life often is? Get a reality check, check this out!",10,0,0,26 November 2000
