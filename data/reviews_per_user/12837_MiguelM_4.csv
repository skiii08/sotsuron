Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas has crossed over to the dark side.
","The first Star Wars movie can be seen as a metaphor for the rebel filmmakers taking on the evil empire of Hollywood. For the rebels, telling a good story was everything. In Hollywood, marketing ruled. Only in Hollywood would filmmakers do dumb things like these: Designing a scene to be turned into a video game. (The pod race.) Putting in a character solely for comic relief. (You know who!) Writing a story that's driven by action, instead of by characters. Star Wars was the work of a true storyteller. The Phantom Menace was ruled by merchandising. George Lucas has crossed over.",2,0,1,31 May 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Visuals: 10; Story 6
","For me, the book was all about Harry overcoming his self doubt, which is a struggle that we all can identify with. The movie was faithful to the narrative, but it left out Harry's struggle with self doubt. That's like doing Gone with the Wind without the Civil War. I can see why kids loved it, but with a little effort, it could have been so much better. Still, I loved seeing Diagon Alley and Hogwarts brought to life, and the actors were all terrific. So in spite of the watered-down story, the child in me was very happy. But the adult in me (45 yrs) hopes the next ones will be better.",7,0,1,21 November 2002
True Romance," Overrated fantasy
","This is a film that started out strong, then fell apart. The only thing that saves it is the acting, which is superb. Patricia Arquette is particularly good.Clarence (Christian Slater) plays a complete fool, who lives in a fantasy world, and tries to live out a movie fantasy. Reality occasionally rears it's ugly head, but never when Clarence is around to see. He never has to face any consequences for his foolishness. He never even finds out that his actions lead to the death someone close to him, much less grieve for the poor fool.The ending is a complete cop-out. We're asked to maintain the same state of denial that Clarence is in. (Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know.) Imagine if the Godfather ended with Michael and his wife breaking out the Champagne bottles to celebrate his victory over his enemies, then living happily ever after.Years after seeing this movie, I found Quentin Tarantino's script in a bookstore. Wow! What a great script. It's the same story, but it's structured differently, and it works a lot better. It also has a much more believable ending, which doesn't descend into codependence. It's too bad Tony Scott had to butcher the film. Don't see this movie. Read Tarantino's script.",5,7,17,1 February 1999
True Romance," Good acting, poorly directed
","As I was watching this movie, lots of things just felt wrong. For example, the way the met seemed so trite, until I learned more about it later on. Overall, the movie didn't work for me. And the ending was a complete cop-out. The hero never has to look at the things he has done, and doesn't even find out what happened to someone he was very close to.Then I read Q. Tarentino's script. Wow! It was so much better than what we saw on the screen. He didn't tell the story in chronological order, so the things that didn't work for me in the movie actually worked really well in the script. And the ending made a whole lot more sense. It's a shame that Director Tony Scott tried to improve on the script. It would have been much better if done Tarentino's way.",5,8,21,28 April 2001
