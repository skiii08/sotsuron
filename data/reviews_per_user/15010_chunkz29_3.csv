The Ring," $$ tr..Ring ....tr..Ring..$$ Naomi at her best,
","i haven't seen much of her movies except for king Kong, ring 2 n ring, but after Ring, i must say that she was at her best, even at her acting, n looks, and talking about the movie, its the most interesting n scary movie I've ever seen, n mind u i saw it alone, but really it was action packed 100 minutes, but surely Ring two was a let down, but i guess she looked much beautiful in the later part. i ll give 10 to Ring n 6 to ring 2 because I've seen Ring 6 times in last 40 days, n still its my favorite, but ring 2 is something u cant see again except for Naomi, Aiden was perfect in first part, but 8 out of 10 in 2nd. during Ring i was not even able to take off my eye for a second but ring two was bit slow in pace as compared to ring. waiting for the 3rd part though...",10,1,2,14 November 2007
Twilight," Most awaited but...
","'When you can live forever, what do you live for?' That's what the maker of the movie missed in the film. OK, lemme start from scratch. As this was the most awaited movie for me, the day when i read its tag line, 'when you can live for.......' i was crazy about this, and than i searched the internet and looked for the releasing date, but as it wasn't going to be released in India, so i had to wait for a bit longer. But during that time i saw its trailers, its walls, n i was really impressed. But than came the IMDb's people review, which was not so good, but i still had few hopes that a movie with the rating of 6+ will be watchable, and in fact it is, and than the day came when i finally bought the CD and saw it, but there was nothing in the movie that i was thinking about, no action, no extra ordinary or super hero stunts apart frown Edward's flying efforts. Bella, well, looked really beautiful, but the issue was not with the cast. The director started off well, but lost it all the way after the half time, and the End, mind you, nothing special, i was expecting it to be one of the best climax's if not the best movie, but ...I was thinking that there would be a point in the climax where the tag line would have been used, but nope, and the only other dialogue i liked, i mean quite liked was, Bella : How old are u? Edward: i am 17! Bella : How long have u been 17? Edward : a while.i really loved it! but the movie overall was below, in fact far below my expectations, even the end doesn't seems to suit.A lot of room for improvement is required, and I've heard the rumors that a sequel is coming this November, well, i wish that the sequel wont have the deficiencies which Twilight had.But I'm still waiting for it!",5,1,4,7 March 2009
The Dark Knight," Ama...zing
","Hmmm... what can i say about this one, it's a master piece, Joker all the way, and great action packed Super villain Movie, really, nothing for batman to do, it was the joker show all the way, but really, he rocked. The dark Knight took me by surprise, i was never interested in batman and i didn't quite like the first one, n also wasn't interested in this, but just when it released, my young brother told me to see the first part, and i did see it, and it did not turn up well. But when i saw the trailers of the Dark Knight, i took my brother to the theater to see it first, and now i'm the biggest Batman, i mean the Joker fan.May his soul rest in peace",10,7,15,13 August 2008
