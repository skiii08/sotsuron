Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," all i can say is 'FINALLY!'
","I just saw Star Wars Episode 1... in fact I saw it twice in a row. It was well worth the wait, I thought. And the actors the picked for the characters were perfect for their roles. I was born and bred on Star Wars, and I just have to say that this movie was one of the most technically advanced marvels I have seen yet... may the force be with you!!!",10,0,0,29 May 1999
