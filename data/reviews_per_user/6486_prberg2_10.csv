Knives Out," Fun and really entertaining!
","Just a really great movie... feels like something fresh and new. Funny, smart, and a great ride. I loved how the mystery unfolded and kept me interested all the way through the movie. Actors all played their parts superbly. Just alot of fun!",9,1,3,19 December 2019
The Irishman," Classic Scorsese. Well made classic.
",Classic Scorsese gangster movie. Has even more heart and character development than some of his previous movies. Great acting by Joe Pesci and De Niro. Great to see them back together again. A well crafted movie.. that did drag for me at times. But still great to see in the theater and on the big screen. If you like Scorsese's films.. you will love The Irishman.,7,3,9,13 November 2019
Interstellar," Great Adventure and truly Breathtaking!
","Really amazing movie. We saw it in IMAX 70mm film and it was just amazing. Really felt like being in space. Sound and visuals were truly awesome! During the rocket scenes, really felt like we were flying through space. Movie wasn't perfect (very few are perfect), but very very good. Couple of strange plot points, and a few moments in the movie that didn't work as well as they could have, but really stunning and a really exciting ride.Go see and experience it on the big screen! Won't be the same at home or on your computer. Great space adventure with lots of heart and personal stories. Some amazing performances and combine that with the great visuals and sound, and it's a movie you won't forget! Very recommended.",8,4,11,7 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not Perfect.. but a great epic conclusion
","First things first.. I did enjoy the movie quite a bit. I tried to not read too much before hand and just see the movie for what it was. I think it does a good job giving most o the characters a proper send off and takes them on a decently done adventure. Nice acting, music, editing, and had some nice light moments as well.Sure there were things that could have been done better. I would have made some different choices.. but it's JJ Abrams. We know by now what his movies are like. They have plot holes and he doesn't seem to care. It's nothing new. He could have tied some things together better and make some things make a bit more sense. But at the end the day I think it was a well done Star Wars movie..and probably in my top 5 SW movies.Just go and enjoy the adventure. It doesn't hurt to let them know what mistakes they made.. but I think it was still a solid SW film and a great conclusion to the Skywalker saga.",7,2,11,4 January 2020
The Favourite," Really Great film, strong from beginning to end
","Just got out of this movie and I really loved it. Wasn't sure exactly what to expect.. and that made it more fun. Wonderful acting, sharp and funny dialogue, and masterful direction. Just a really strong film on all levels and Highly recommended.",9,3,9,11 December 2018
1917," Amazing film... so powerful in how to transports you back onto the War
",What a powerful film! This movie is so well done... you really feel like you are there with the characters as they go out on their journey.. not sure if they will make it. Every level of the film is just masterful. Actors were all great.. but the way the story was told it's just so powerful. Looks simple.. but so much work must have gone in to pull that all off. Just flows so well and you are in the story from the beginning to the end.I'd vote for it for Best Picture for sure! So well done... congrats!,9,0,2,18 January 2020
Joker," Well made.. but lacking in real meaningful development
",When they say dark.. they really mean it. But I guess some people really like going to those dark evil places. Acting was strong and some cool stylistic things going on.. but it just seemed to celebrate violence. Yes it's just a movie.. but I guess I'm not a fan of violence with no real world effects. Also Joker really seemed to switch so quickly.. I thought there would be more about how and why he turned so evil. Some missed opportunities to make the film really mean something greater.,6,4,14,9 October 2019
Parasite," Well made movie.. brings up interesting themes
",I do feel this movie is really well made. Alot of things worked well and the movie was enjoyable. I liked the mix of humor and darkness. I really enjoyed the actors and the way the movie was put together.I'm still working on what the movie was trying to say. Maybe the message wasn't supposed to be clear to the audience.. but some aspects just felt a little muddled and cliche.Despite the story issues which I felt didn't all make sense.. still a really powerful and interesting movie. Well done.,8,1,6,23 October 2019
Midway," Entertaining and Interesting but lacking real character
","Midway.... an entertaining film. I did enjoy learning about the famous battle and the courage of the soldiers who put their lives on the line. Movie was pretty well done... although the script seemed pretty weak with a lot of the dialogue sounded cheesy.I also felt that the pacing of the movie was off. Things just felt rushed. Sections that were big parts of the movie just were done so quickly. The film just felt like it was rushing and we were never let to feel the moment or power of a scene. It was just rushed on to the next scene.The score was pretty boring. For such an important event.. the music and score is so important. I felt the score was not good and didn't help the movie very much.Movie could have been a lot better with better attention to the script, better editing and score. The actors were doing the best with what they were given.",7,1,1,15 November 2019
