Casablanca," Refresing take on an old theme
","Casablanca is a refreshing deviation from the usual romantic drivel that Hollywood now produces. This is probably because more than anything it was a propaganda piece urging America to enter the war. This is most apparent in the last scene when Humphrey Bogart tells the 'love of his life,' that them being together is unimportant in the grand scheme of things, that there are much more important forces at work. Tha they must embrace the cause they believe in, and go their separate ways. Quite a different approach when looking at films now, where feelings and love are all encompassing and one's duty in the face of adversity should take back seat to falling in love.",8,1,2,25 March 2011
The Graduate," Ahead of its time
","The Graduate's (1967) release was a significant cinematically. The movie, unlike movies before it, discusses sex openly and depicts the life of a young man in a much more realistic light. Rather than glossing over and pretending all of mankind is sexless- as many movies of the time did. The film also shows nudity in quick flashes, which would have been unheard of only a few years before. The soundtrack of the movie is also 'more modern', utilizing Simon and Garfunkle rather than the usual more classic soundtracks that seemed to be standard in older movies. The editing and filming of The Graduate are much more conscientious than earlier movies, calling attention to itself.",8,1,1,13 May 2011
