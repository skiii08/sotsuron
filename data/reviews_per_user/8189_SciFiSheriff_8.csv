The King's Speech," Speechless!
","let's face it: 2010 wasn't the best year for movies. A year full of terrible reboots, squeals and snore-fests that gave critics a lot to complain about. When the Oscars came about in 2011, I was really annoyed that the only great movie that year, INCEPTION, was snubbed for best picture. Who was the mysterious larcenist? none other than the Kings speech. The king's speech flew under my radar, believe it or not, I never seen any of the trailers. So lately, after looking into the positive reviews, I sat down and watched the film that captured even our own Queen Elizabeth II's attention.The King's speech is a historical drama about King George VI, the monarch who reigned over the United Kingdom in the time of one of the most devastating wars in history. However, George lacked something that strong leaders required; Fluent speech. As a victim of a speech impediment, King George seeks out a therapist to help develop him vocally before he can speak publicly. I'm going to say it now - The kings speech blew me away in numerous ways. The sheer depth and emotion of the film lifts it high above any other film in the genre, with beautiful acting, music, cinematography and script- the bare bones of an instant classic.lets start with the acting. Now I haven't seen many Colin Firth movies bar Mama Mia (which didn't leave a good impression), but his performance as King George VI was among the best of the modern era, second to DDL's performance in Lincoln. You really invested in his character. Playing a person with a stutter is very hard to pull off effectively, but Firth hits all the right notes. Going into this film I believed that he would pull of the clich√© performance and that his voice would be perfect by the end of the movie- but no! Actually, he never truly fixes his voice and even at the final climatic speech, George still struggles to get a word across. This is what makes his performance great. He shows how hard it really is, in that even with months of practise, he still finds it hard to talk to his own brother. Props to Colin! All the other actors are exceptional also, with the likes of Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter (serious role??). The Kings speech shines in the acting category like no other British film.If your a historian, like me, you probably know this story inside out, and may also be annoyed at the slight liberties they took in writing the film's script. However, in order to get the appropriate emotional response, I believe it was necessary. If I was to complain about the film, it would be that the plot does become predictable at times, and there are many scenes that you are able to guess the outcomes before they happen, but the sheer presentation and delivery of the script overpowers these insignificant factors and make you forget about all that. I don't believe many of you watch movies for their camera angles, (and if you do, join the club!0, but I just loved the cinematography in this film. Its hard to describe the movement of the camera without showing you the movie, but if you watch the movie in full HD and look out for how each scene is filmed, you too will be blown away. Finally, I cannot Finnish this review without at least mentioning the musical score. The score is the heart and soul of this very movie that inflects some very strong emotions in many of the scenes. The constant piano playing may be an annoyance to all you heavy metal junkies out there but if your into classical, or just music in general, if nothing else at least buy the films soundtrack. Am I still annoyed at Inception's best picture snub?Of coarse! but that's another review for another time. What got the award is a stylish, sleek, artsy movie, with breath taking visuals, acting and sound. I left this film proud to be a British citizen and wanted to grab the nearest microphone, get up in public and give a inspirational speech. Regardless to anyone that would care about me doing that, any movie that gives me such an urge deserves praise in my book.",10,1,2,26 March 2013
Vertigo," A chilling, Thrilling, entertaining classic!
","British Director Alfred Hitchcock has made some good movies in his time. 2 Of his films really stand out to me; North By NorthWest and...Vertio!! The plot goes like this;A detective who is haunted by his dramatic past involving heights is asked to shadow a old friend's wife who has gone insane. She makes regular pleasure jaunts on her own and appears to be trying to commit suicide. The more detective John Ferguson delves into the situation however, the more he falls desperately in love with the woman...James Stwert has done a lot of movies for Hitchcock; The man who knew too much remake, Rope, rear window-all classics. However, James Stewart really tops it all in this thrilling extravaganza.Lets start off with the acting. As you wold expect from a film of this class, the acting is nothing under A*. James Stewart plays his role perfectly, adding great lines and sometimes anger into his role. The supporting cast is fantastic too. The reason I don't delve to deep into what the actors say is because this film is surprisingly action based (No, not shooting). What I mean is sometimes, the film has no talking what-so-ever. Instead you see the characters expressions and movements to a great extent and you can almost read the character's minds. This is a technique lost in modern filmmaking.Spoilers coming up.The story is sometimes really hard to follow, especially halfway through the film. You eventually find out that the woman committing suicide is actually a conspiracy made by her husband to murder. James Stewart gets caught in the scene and when he finally finds it all out, it's too late. but then another woman who looks identical to the woman who was murdered appears in town and Stewert can't resist looking into it. I will not spoil any more for you, but I can guarantee, the ending will make you think good, long and hard about it. Not that that's a bad thing of coarse.Fantastic storyline that lacks in a lot of thrillers.Another thing I liked about the acting was the creepy wife. Throughout the movie, she looks completely blank; no expressions, no emotions, Nothing!! She rarely speaks in the whole film apart from about once a scene. In my opinion she is one of the most well crafted characters in thriller history.Lots of scenes in this movie are very intense. They will have you at the end of your scene and most of this is due to what I call musical timing. This is where films use the right types of music for the right scenes and they have to be at an exact moment, or the scene will fall flat on it's face. in this film, it is used to an extreme. Sometimes it will be really quite and then music will bare out when something intense happens. The musical score is pure brilliance.All in all, a fantastic thriller and probably Hitchcock's greatest hit, tied with Noth By Northwest which you should really check out if you love this film.To think this film was poorly received when it first came out! in fact, it was James' last movie working with Hitchcok because Hitchcock thought he was to blame for the failure. humph. I right! Anyway Brilliant film and one of the best heart stopping thrillers of all time.",10,2,5,5 January 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Underrated Sci-fi Flick
","Star Wars has got to be my favourite movie saga collection of all time. I mean, there is so much stuff to sink your teeth into- the 7 films, the TV series, the comics and books- They are all monumental.However this one isn't really up to scratch. Yes, this is my review on the first Star Wars Prequel, The Phantom Menice.The plot goes like this; In a Galaxy far ,far away, a republic is under the threat of rebellion. Two mighty Jedi, Qui-gon Jinn and Obi-one kinobi, are sent out to investigate a flying fortress which has been spotted making aggressive moves toward the peaceful planet of Naboo. Things Don't go to plan, and The Jedi stumble across a plot that eventually leads to war. The movie's plot is rather deep and may require a couple of watches for people new to the star wars saga- That's if you want to see it again! The film contains LOTS of things that will put people of the franchise for good. Take Jar Jar binks for example. There is absolutely no reason why he should be in this film! Every time he appeared on the screen I just wanted to whack the TV. His annoying personality and jokes my appeal to younger viewers, but not to anyone over 8 years old. It was clearly obvious that the character was made to provide comic relief to viewers who either couldn't understand the plot, or didn't want to. Other than that, The character are well acted and well thought out, especially Qui-Gon Jinn's character. There seemed to be a lot of background to the character that you just don't find our in the film. He is wise and rebellious at the same time which I find a very intriguing and different. After seeing 3 films with 'perfect' Jedi it was good to see a Jedi with different views of the Jedi way. It was also good to see Obi-wan Kanobi ALIVE again. There was a lot of mystery in the character when you watch Episode IV, but now, you start to see a bit more of his past. There was actually one Ironic scene where he meets anikin for the first time. It will float over the heads of casual viewers but it was rather interesting to see Obi-Wan talk to the child that will eventually kill him later on in the series. Both these characters are well acted.Another character that i found interesting was Darth maul. This was the first time we got to see another sith on the big screen other than Vader and Saidous. It was also the first time we see a person wield a double-bladed light sabre. Although he only has a couple of lines of dialogue, You grow to like the character. When he starts fighting you only see on blade, which was normal enough. At the showdown at the end however you see him with two blades and it's quite interesting to watch.The storyline flows, for the most part, rather smoothly, but I thought it started to drag abit when the the Jedi land on the desert planet Tatooinee and gamble over a young boy, Anakin, who eventually turns out to be Vader. I'm not a huge fan of his appearance in this film. He acts like any child would but for some reason, it zaps the evilness out of his later character. I never really cared for the character and just longed for him to shut up and do what he had to do. In this case, he had to race in a planetary 'Pod-race'. This may entertain some, however I found it rather boring. The whole 'Tatooinee sequence' Lasts for almost half the movie and sometimes it makes you feel as if you are watching a different movie. It takes away from flow of the story completely and at one point it nearly made me want to turn it off! They finally get back on their ship and just when they are about to leave, Darth Maul jumps out of nowhere and starts attacking Qui-Gon. This is where the film gets interesting. Seeing light sabre clash was just what I needed to refresh my mind after about 30-40 minutes of boredom.'Why do you give it such a High rating then?' you may ask.Well, I would've given this film a 4/10 if the following 30-40 minutes hadn't happened. It was like the creator of the film just said 'right, we've probably bored the fans to tears. Lets give them what they want' I don't know about anyone else, but it was certainly something to admire. There was about 4 battles happening at the same time!- One huge space battle, one fantastic palace shootout, one massive ground battle and one well-choreographed light sabre battle. What I cant understand is that people who hate this film never seem to mention this part of the film. Maybe they were sleeping. Whatever they were doing, don't let them put you off if you love a good battle. There was explosions, loud gunfire, droids blowing up, fighters blowing up- Edge of you seat entertainment if you ask me! When all the other battles die down, the battle with maul continues and (Spoiler) to my surprise, Master Qui-gon Jinn gets stabbed.It was a huge surprise and quite a shock. And to a further shock, Maul gets sliced in half. These Characters were starting to grow on me but, like most Star Wars Movies and TV shows, The good characters have to be killed off. I'm going to be honest, Some parts of this film were absolutely rubbish. But I have to say, the climax more than made up for it. All in all, a great film with some really horrid talk scenes in it. Skip the middle part, leave your brain off at the door and enjoy.",8,8,12,12 December 2011
Gettysburg," ...'Fourscore a seven years ago'...
","The American civil war has got to be one the most interesting yet horrid wars ever to break lose in pre-modern history.Even with modern technology developing and battle tactics changing, it has become one of the most heartbreaking wars as brother fought against brother for a cause right in their own eyes. And out of all the civil war movies produced, only one truly shows this to it's full extent.This is my review on Gettysberg.The plot goes like this; It's July 1863, halfway though the American civil war. The leader of the Confederates, Robert E Lee, launches a attack on the little town of Gettysberg. Little did both sides know that it was going to be the most ghastly battles ever to be raged on American soil.The American civil war is one of my favourite topics in history. There is just so much political intrigue between the to sides of the war. Both sides had very good reasons to grab a gun a fight for their country. Conferderates wanted Slavery and felt that the union, who wanted to end slavery, was taking away a major part of their economy. The union thought slavery was completely inhuman. In a way, this topic is depressing because they weren't fighting against another country that they could join together and fight. This war pitted friends, brothers and loved ones against each other, sometimes unwillingly. America was on the brink of collapse.Onto the movie. the movie centres around the topic mentioned above but delves deep into it. However, unlike most civil war movies, Gettysberg shows both sides of the story, highlighting every reason for fighting. In my opinion, they couldn't have done it better as you feel for every character in the film. every loss in battle makes you cringe. Wiether your loyal to the union or the confederacy, you are going to feel for each individual character.The acting is top notch for a film like this. Jeff Daniels takes centre stage on the union side, staring as Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. His performance is definitely memorable as he recites many of the films great speeches and delivers the best performance of his career. Other people that stood out were Martin Sheen, Stephen Lang and Tom Berenger. Each and every performance was heart felt and they all seemed to enjoy every minute of their performances, even when their characters are suffering loss. The tone of the film is fantastic. It's start6s off a bit slow developing the characters back stories but once the battles take place, you really start to get the feeling the director is trying to get across. All the scenes before battles sometimes feel a bit meaningless, but most show the true depressing fact that all the soldiers don't want to fight, they just want what's good for their state and country. One thing this film does brilliantly is the relationship between two of the characters. Both play Generals on both sides of the war. They both long to see each other again before the battle proceeds but fear that they might not make it out alive. This is where the film shines and it portrays one of the best friendships in the history of film. The action scenes are also fantastic. Each scene, including the huge main battle at the end, begin with a huge battle plan which is interesting to see them establish. History/military fans will enjoy each and every moment. The body count is huge with thousands of human bodies on screen at one time and it works to the film's advantage, making it feel huge.In conclusion, you probably know how I feel about the movie. It is VERY long and it could have been cut down a bit as there seems to be a lot of fill, but I'm not going to mark the film down for that. I say if you like history and the military see this film. Many may find this film boring and I would see where they are coming from but this film is right up my street. Im giving it a solid 10/10.",10,0,2,14 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Action Packed Extraviganza that is a FORCE to reckon with!
","After a disappointing start to a trilogy of prequels to the greatest Sci Fi saga of all time, I started to have my doubts they would pull this one off.Boy did I get a slap in the face!The plot goes like this;Jedi padawan Anikin Skywalker is assigned to protect a senator of the war torn planet of Naboo from a series of assassination attempts. His Jedi Master, Obi wan Kinobi, stumbles across a unknown planet that was not supposed to exist. He also discovers that a bunch of cloners called the Kaminoains are establishing a mighty army at the request of a Jedi who has been dead for a long time. The army is said to be given to the Galatic republic to fight the growing separatist forces, which are having traitorous thoughts about the capital.The plot line is VERY deep in this movie. You may need to watch Star Wars The Phantom Menace to get most of the information portrayed in the film. The movie consists of multiple mysterious plot lines which all click together by the end.As always in the Star Wars films, the acting is great. There are many scenes of high expression especially from Obi-Wan and Anikin. The actors put a lot of passion into what they are saying and they really make the film believable.This time round, the movie is a little slow to start off. There are just talk of assassination and the discovery of a new planet. This part of the film plays out like a crime thriller with lots of Sci Fi element thrown in. When Obi Wan gets to the planet he has been searching for, Kamino, the movie really gets going. Obi Wan bumps into a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Jango is one of the main reasons why I like the film so much. From the first time you see him in his blue battle Armour, you instantly like the character. He exploits many tools and weapons from 2 personalised blaster pistols to a jet pack that fires rockets. In every scene you see him fighting he uses a new weapon to keep you interested. Fans of the original will recognise that the armour is identical to the armour of another bounty hunter Boba. You find out that this guy is actually Boba fett's Father. We also see a young Boba Fett which we had not seen before. This was intriguing in itself, but in a way, it sort of zaps out the ruthlessness of the original character, who's past had been shrouded in mystery until now. We finally find out that Boba Fett is actually a clone of his father and is basically the same type of clone as the millions being made for the republic. The character's background seemed unnecessary but it was quite entertaining to find out his origins.The middle half of the film is spent on the desert planet, Tatooinee, like they did with the first prequel. Why they included this part I don't know but what do know is that Star Wars films need to cut down on it! Most of the scenes in the first film (A New Hope)took place on the same planet, but they were't half as uninteresting as these scenes. Anyway, Anikin, after going to tatooinee against order, sets off to find his mother who was captured by native scum. She Dies and Anikin takes a hissy fit saying he could have saved her. That sums up about 30 minutes of the film. WASTE OF TIME! Finally, they move to a planet Geienosis (Probably not spelt right), yet again without permission. This time it's to help Obi-Wan, who was captured by the separatists. They all eventually get caught and are sentenced to death by three of the strangest looking creatures. They break free and a huge battle take place. IT'S HUGE! Monsters run about trying to kill the Jedi, Battle droids come out and start blasting the the monsters and the Jedi frantically dodge them. Massive amounts of battle droids come out, and start blowing stuff up. Just when you think you can't take much more, about 70-80 Jedi jump out of nowhere and join the fight. It gets really hectic when huge gunships swoop down and bombard all the droids. This is probably the biggest battle I have ever seen in a film! It's high octane stuff that will blast you out of your seats. Watch this sequence on the biggest TV you can find and use the biggest speakers money can buy. You will NOT be disappointed, Trust me!The film contains some of the best movie music I have ever heard. Some of the gentle music is extremely appealing and I advise all movie music fans to buy the CD Soundtrack. It's just beautiful.With Fantastic Acting, great duologue and FANTASTIC ACTION SECQANCES it is hard not to love the film. An Action fan's dream and a Sci Fi junky's dream. Definitely one of my favourites of the series.",10,5,9,13 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Make 'um smile, make 'um cry...and make 'um laugh!
","Musicals used to be one of the most popular Genres of all time with classic hits like Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Clamity Jane and Fiddler on the roof. But, like in every Genre, there is always one that rules the roost...This is my review on Singing In The Rain.The plot goes like this;It's the roaring twenties and the silent era of film dominates public entertainment. At this time, Don Lockwood is the most famous man in the film industry staring in hundreds of popular silent films along side his love interest Lina Lamont. When the first ever talking picture is released, directors and producers are forced to leave the era behind and begin making 'talkies'. Things turn out for the worst when Don's first vocal film is a disaster which would lead to his downfall. However, his best friends Cosmo Brown and Kathy Selden decide to turn things around and persuade Don to transfer the film into a musical before the film ruins his career.There's no other phrase for it; Singing in the rain is a masterpiece. Trying to pick faults in this film is like trying to pick faults in a perfect diamond- There is none!So what makes the film so good?Lets start with the acting. Acting legend Gene Kelly stars as the main character, Don, and his performance is WAY above average. This is the film that turned his career around and there is good reason for this. The way he smiles, the way he laughs- what ever he does you buy the character. His part is quite hard to play and Gene gets the emotions of the character spot on. He also is a fantastic singer, but I will get onto that later. However, while Gene is brilliant, the actor who steals the show is Donald O'Connor's Cosmo Brown. NEVER have I laughed so much at an actor's performance in all my life. There is not a man on earth who can play the part of Cosmo Brown like Donald. You often find yourself looking at I'm even when he is not speaking in case he is making some hysterical facial expression. How he never brakes into i cink of laughing is beyond comprehension, but Cosmo Brown has to be one of the greatest characters in movie history. Finally, Kathy Selden is played by the lovely Debbie Reynolds. Her performance is great, though there isn't as much to say about it as the two actors i mentioned above.The plot is actually really good for a musical. Musicals are usually pretty basic films with light hearted plots, which is fine, but Singing in the rain delivers more than that. Singing in the rain is definitely great for young children as the plot is easy to follow and there is a lot of funny material in the film to keep them entertained. This is the film children should be watching instead of films that have adult material which children seem to like these days. The film is also great for casual viewers who love music and romance and if you are one of these people, you will be greatly impressed. The film, however, really stands out for die hard film fans as is has all the things above plus a little more. There are lots of references to films before it's time like Lovey Mary and even Citizen Kane. The man plot even revolves around The Jazz Singer, the very first talking film. They could have easily just said that the vocal films are coming into fashion, but this film takes it one step further and actually addresses the actual film that started it all which relates the film to the real world.The film's greatest feature is it's musical numbers. The music in this film surpasses the music of the modern age by FAR. Each song is lively, innocent, funny and heartwarming and you actually feel the love and emotion that went into writing these marvellous songs. I am only going to address some of the songs cause I would rather you go into the film and be surprised. 'Make 'um laugh' (sang by Donald) is the funniest song of the film, which really relates to the title. It consists of Donald pulling of a serious of stunts and I still cant fathom how he did them. You see him bouncing off wall and flirting with an old doll. Garenteed laugh. May favourite song in the whole film the theme song, Singing in the rain. Every time your hear the tune you are instantly prepared to have your heart filled with Joy at the brilliant lyrics. The love song by Gene, which is debatably his best scene in all his acting career. The icon of him hanging happily onto a lamppost is one of the most famous movie symbols of all time- and with good reason! It's time to wrap the review up. Singing in the rain is so wonderful that words cannot sum it up in one single review. The romance is great, the songs are perfect, the plot is intriguing and the acting is amongst the best in history. This is the film i'll be watching again and again. This is the film I will be sharing with my children. This is one of the best movies ever made!I'm definitely giving Singing in the rain a 10/10",10,0,2,19 June 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Epic Saga goes out with a bang!
","In 2005, George Lucas finished making his final Star Wars Live Action film. It had to be epic. It had to beat his previous two films. It had to make an impact.Did it live up to these questions? Yes, Yes and YES! This is my review on Star Wars Episode III-Revenge Of The Sith The plot goes like this;3 years have passed since the beginning of the clone wars and the republic are closing in on a decisive victory. But all is not as it seems. There appears to be a dark force behind the separatists, far more powerful than the Jedi themselves. Jedi Knight Anikin Skywalker is starting to slip away from the Jedi Council and the Jedi soon find out they are too late to stop the new face of evil who is rising from their own ranks...After it's action packed predecessor, I thought Revenge of the sith would have to do a lot of work to match it. So they did! The starts off with a huge space battle with so many explosions you many not be able to contain it. There is fighters blasting other fighters. There is battleships bombarding each other. Man, if you watch the opening scene about 3 time in a continuous loop, and look at different parts of the screen you will experience a brand new battle. There is so much happening and it gives a lot of re-watch value.The acting is top notch, even better than it's predecessors. It's like George Lucas (Director,Writer) said 'Right, last film. I want everyone to act like there is no tomorrow. I know people hated my previous films, but I want to leave this with a little respect from my fans'. Well I really think he did a good job at that. The tension drips of the actors in the most key points, with scenes of strong emotion and pain, especially at the end. When Anikin (Spoiler) eventually turns to the dark side, he screams and shouts like anyone in that position would. He is suffering from fear of losing his wife and he turns to what seems to be the best option to prevent this. When you look at it this way, you can't really blame him. Anikin's master, Obi Wan is clearly heartbroken, and it is VERY clear to see. There are scenes in this movie where Obi Wan looks if he is going to start crying. Who wouldn't when one of their best friends turn against them, even to the extent of trying to kill them.Actor Ewan McGregor really pulls it off, and I really don't think anyone could do a better job! A* performances from every character. (Spoiler ended) Christophor Lee makes another appearance which I was really pleased about.After all, he is one of my favourite actors. He acted phenomenally in the second prequel and he never fouled up in this one. His fight scene in this film is just plan epic, but a little too quick. During this, he and the 2 Jedi he is fighting, Obi Wan and Anikin, deliver some witty but cheesy lines. For example, Anikin says 'My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count'. Count Dooku(Christophor's character) smiles and says 'Good. Twice the pride, double the fall'. Classic, Just pure classic.There's also a brand new bad guy named General Grevious. The character is oozing with diverse characteristics even though he is completely CGI. He is a bio-mechanical life-form with a deep, mysterious background and a love of killing Jedi. Even to look at he is quite impressive. On first glance, you think he is some form of battle droid, but when it zooms in on his eyes you start to really think about who or what he is. He has a lot of back story not told in the movie which makes me like the character more. The most interesting thing about him is that he fights with not 1, not 2 , NOT 3 but 4 LIGHTSABRES! Nothing like this had ever taken place in the Staar Wars saga and it was good to see the writers adding more of a diverse way of fighting rather than the usual single lightsabre technique. At times, he has only 2 arms but when he gets into action, another 2 arms fold out so he can hold extra lightsabres. when you see him wave those things it's beautiful eye candy. His battle with Obi Wan in the middle of the film is definitely a highlight is is definitely worth watching.The final act of the film is a single piece of inspirational cinematography that makes this film Oscar worthy. It bases around the fall of the Jedi, with many Jedi being mowed down by their own soldiers. This is called Order 66 in the movie and when it happens you don't know wither to sit in awe or burst out crying. It's summed up in a short action packed montage, with one of the most fitting musical scores ever composed for film. It really shapes the tone of the film completely making it even more respectful. As the final battles throw down, you really feel sorry for the heroes as they are on the losing side. A much loved hero anikin turns to the dark side and you really feel every emotion going through each of the characters. The final act alone is just so well done I came out of this film content that they finished the Star Wars Saga the way they did. In conclusion, this is probably one of my favourite Star Wars films, but also one of my favourite films in general. The tone is well placed, the acting is fantastic, the characters are well made and the action is phenomenal.Definatatly give this one a watch.",10,5,9,15 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The birth of a legend!
","There are many brilliant sci fi movies, but there a few that are as well written, well acted and well done as the Star Wars Saga. Action fantasy films that have been a movie inspiration for over 30 years. This is my review on the fist classic hit- Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope.The plot goes like this;Along time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a viscous government called the empire controls the universe. A newly found rebellion stakes back at the brutal empire by stealing plans to their Ultimate Super weapon, The death star, which has the mechanical power to destroy a whole planet in a single second. As the empire hunts the plans down, A princess in charge of the rebellion is ambushed by an imperial battleship. She and her accomplices are captured, but manage to hide the plans in a small droid, recording a short help request to an old man on the planet below. The put the droids in an escape pod and send them down to the planet without the imperials finding out. The droids crash land on the dusty planet and bump into a young man and a old Jedi warrior. They watch the recording of the princess's plea for help. They 2 men set off to find and release the princess from imperial captivity.The plot is rather simple, which is a change from the movie's sequels. The movie's plot is recognisable to other famous movies and is sometime clich√©. However, this is not a bad thing. It is not clich√© in the since that it is EXACTLY the same as other films, but instead is a sort-of homage the the classics and taking a different approach to the same idea. For example, in the John Wayne film, The Searchers, John Wayne returns to his encampment finding it burnt to the ground and all his loved one dead. The same thing happens in this film; The young man Luke drives home to find his farm is burnt to the ground and his adopted parents killed. It uses classic plot lines and forms them in a very smart way. The acting is pretty good. It contains master performances from great actors like Peter Cushing,Alec Guinass and Harrison ford. All of whom are great, most notably Harrison's and Peter's performances. Harrison produces a grumpy, sarcastic gunfighter type character who always comes up with a droll comment to everything. You always find yourself waiting to see what he says back to a person in a conversion which is rare in film characters. Peter is already a A* actor but after this movie he I find that becomes an even better one. There is a sleazy feel to the character and as soon as he is first seen in the film you know that he is an evil character, which is a great achievement for a villain. Of coarse, I cannot continue without mentioning the other villain of the film. The main one at that who just happens to hold the title of one of the best villains of movie history; Darth Vader! He is a heavy walking, heavy breathing, force choking, brutal killing type character who has death teeming off him. He is a cruel douche-bag but every time you see him you don't know wither to hate or love him. When he executes horrid directives like the force choke, He also adds a dark remark related to the offender's crime. Well written character with fantastic duologue and great lightsabre moves. He is NOT a force to be reckoned with!!The film contains loads of creative Sci Fi elements that, in my opinion, make the film the great thing it is. In the cantina scene, there a A lot of strange creatures that only have a couple of seconds screen time, but really intrigue you. It's not a major part of the film, but it still makes the film seem more real. Now-a-days, directors shove CGI in your face and have no creative appeal to it at all. In the old films like these, they become really imaginative, making latex models and sometimes Stopmotion animation. This is the icing on the cake for me. Props to the animators.The Plot never really drags throughout the film and flows at a steady pace. There are also some brilliant action scenes. In the death star scenes there are some tense shootouts and fights that keep you at the edge of your seat. The battles are fast paced; The heroes can be shooting one minute and falling into a trash compacter the next. The most notable battle in the film however is the battle over the Death star. This is when the rebels launch a massive attack on the death star. This was probably one of the first good movie space battles, with tones of explosions and cannon fire to keep your adrenaline rushing.With Great acting, The best villain of all time and fantastic action this movie is really hard to beat. A Sci Fi classic that needs to be seen.",10,2,3,16 December 2011
