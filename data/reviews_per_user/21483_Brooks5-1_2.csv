Gremlins," One Of The 80's Best Movies!
","This was one of my favorite movies since I saw it as a little kid. I'm pretty sure if my Dad had actually seen what happened in the movie, he would have taken it away from me, but it was safely hidden behind a PG rating, so he didn't mind me watching it (my Mom was much cooler and we would always watch it together). Anyway, I thought it was great then, and I think it's great now. I just re-watched it yesterday, and it's still amazing. What's great is how well director Joe Dante combines all sorts of elements; horror, comedy, romance, etc. Really, I'd call this the most twisted Christmas film ever, even worse than Bad Santa. Yes, they're different, and yes, that movie was one of the sickest films ever (but hilarious), but what makes Gremlins so sick is how it starts of so harmless and cutesy. Bad Santa made no denial that it wasn't for children, but Gremlins tricks you. As it starts, the last thing you expect to be is scared. A peaceful, snowy hometown, kind citizens, a loving dad who brings home a REALLY cute little creature named Gizmo. What's scary about that? Then, after you've safely settled in and are comfortable, Dante pulls the carpet out under you feet and the story turns into one about ugly monsters blowing up in microwaves or being killed in a blender. Dante actually did horror/comedy well. It seems like most movies that claim to be horror/comedies are actually just silly comedies with lots of blood and guts which aren't in the least bit scary. Here, the movie is blood-chillingly scary in scenes, and gut bustingly funny in others. For instance, the scene with the Gremlins wreaking havoc at Dorry's tavern is just plain silly and funny, but the scene with Frances Lee McCain searching the house and finding the creatures in her kitchen is just REALLY scary and creepy. Plus, the acting's great and the special effects are amazing. It makes me sad to think that if any other movie like this was made, they'd use bad CGI that's not at all realistic. People mtalk about how much more advanced movies are today, but I disagree. Which is easier to believe is real: the Gremlins in this movie or Yoda in Star Wars Episode Two? This movie was follwed by a terrific sequel that threw the horror out the window and made no denial to being a flat out comedy, and one of the smartest and most entertaining ever. Don't miss that one, either.",9,0,2,9 October 2008
There's Something About Mary," There's Something About Mary You Just Can't Describe!
","There's Something About Mary is a hilliarous dim-witted comedy great for the teens and guys in your life! One of my favorite movies of all time but, not one I would share with the kiddies on family movie. In this movie you a young boys infatuation with the one who got away in high school-- the new girl Mary(Diaz) who is the girl in high school that just has it all sensitivity, looks, and charisma. She actually goes to prom with Ted(Stiller) who has the geeky hair and braces. Only problem is prom never happens after Stiller has a problem in the bathroom when he accidentally hits the 'frank' when zipping up his fly. Many years later still consumed with Mary-- Ted decides to her down hiring a dective who also falls for Mary. The dective makes up a story about Mary to Ted about her being 200 pounds and in a wheel-chair to turn Ted off while he moves to go be close to Mary. Mary hasn't changed at all and when Ted learns about where Mary is he decides to see her. Things haven't changed and their still is a connection with her. Then, the world comes crashing in when Ted learns that is not the only one who sees there is something about Mary-- her admirers include someone obsessed with shoes, a pro-football player, a class a- jerk, a pizza guy, and Ted who never got over Mary. All in all this a hilliarou comedy! One to have in your collection! All admit the storyline is a little too dim-witted at times jumping around from a axe-murderer hitchhiker, to a trip to the emergancy room on prom night, to a dog set on fire-- to the guy that loves Mary's shoes. I've watched this movie over a 100 times and I still laugh every time I see it-- I guess there is Something About Mary you just can't describe. Rent or buy this one and laugh yourself silly!",6,2,4,9 October 2008
