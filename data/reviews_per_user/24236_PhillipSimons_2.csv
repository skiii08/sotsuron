Walk the Line," A Thing Called Love
","It is the movie I was waiting for...about the childhood and early rock 'n' roll years of Johnny Cash as well as the relationship with June Carter. All mixed together it results an excitable and amusing movie. The story is based on Johnnys autobiography with some slight changes, but generally captures the best and the most important moments. The Folsom prison scene at the beginning makes you really feel like entering into a live concert and is one of the few memorable scenes in this movie.Surely the acting has to be praised, Joaquin Phoenix as well as Reese Witherspoon really got into their roles and were very convincing, you actually feel the chemistry between them! Both Joaquin and Reese made a Oscar-worth performance! Although I sometimes missed Johnnys voice in the songs, Joaquin(Reese also) made a solid singing performance as well so there cant be any real objections. Throughout the movie we hear great early songs of Johnny (and June), like Cry!Cry!Cry!, I Walk the Line, Jackson, Get Rhythm, Ring of Fire, Folsom Prison Blues,...'Walk the Line' must be watched as a love story in first, and not a detailed Johnny Cash movie, and some parts of his life were just kind off simplified for the purpose of this love story(like why Johnny wears black,...). I cant loose the feeling that Johnny was even stronger and more charismatic then shown in the movie. But I guess its because we see just the young years of Cash. But this movie succeeds not only because of its great actors and classic love story. 'Walk the Line' also manages to display the engaging portraits of stars like Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis(also episode roles of Waylon Jennings or Roy Orbison), of course just as background, but after all the 50ties are just unthinkable without them. And it comes to my mind that Johnny Cash really outlived them, they lived fast but also burn out fast, except for Johnny. He went on, and on,...and the strength for this came out of June and the love that was connecting them..",6,0,1,27 February 2006
Casino Royale," This Bond has it...
","Last week I went to the cinema rather skeptic but also very excited to see the new Bond movie. And I must say, the movie surpassed my expectations.It's a real comeback of James Bond, and may I say in style. Daniel Craig has been constantly disputed as a adequate Bond-actor, and in the first few times he looks a bit unconfined. But in a very curious way, Craig transforms and adapts - charming when needed, but mostly serious and dark, like the Bond interpreted by Timothy Dalton, but better, even deeper and more variable, somewhere near the middle of the picture we become familiar even with his very Bond-unlike look(he could have easily been chose for a Bond villain role, makes the perfect Russian spy/general look). But not only Craig should be praised, but the entire cast, especially the very confident, sophisticated and comfortable Mads Mikkelsen who makes a terrific Bond villain. Moreover, finally we get a brake from all the high-tech insane terrorists and their scams to destroy the world in a bizarre way, and can concentrate on some very amusing card - game duels and money chases.But the strongest thing about this movie is the balance between action and the plot development, something that lacked in every of the past Brosnan movies. Very smooth and easy going, you can enjoy the plot development all the 144 minutes of the movie. And finally a Bond movie manages to evade that unnecessary megalomaniac behavior, and stays away from paroles like 'The World is Not Enough'.David Arnold pointed one more time out that he is the right man to make the score, although we all miss some John Barry tunes.We get some rest from 'Q' and his tricky gadgets, no Moneypenny dialog, but despite of it all, this movie should be considered as one of the best Bond pictures ever.",7,0,1,26 November 2006
