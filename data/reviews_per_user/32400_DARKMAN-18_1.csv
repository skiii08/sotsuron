The Blair Witch Project," MEGA-HYPE RUINS THIS MOVIE
","I just finished seeing this movie, and if I had not been exposed to the TREMENDOUS overkill(How could you NOT be unless you've been stranded on a deserted island) by the industry, I probably would have been much more impressed and affected.  I'm sure this film DID have a huge impact on the initial audiences that viewed it, but if you still haven't seen it, there is NO way BWP will possibly fulfill the expectations you experience when you see the trailers and snippets on TV, magazines, etc.  Be prepared to let out a couple of yawns and don't strain your eyes too much trying to make out what time it is on your watch(Fortunately, I had an Indiglo!), even though this movie is really only about 75 minutes in length.  If you do go see this movie, my suggestion is to either go alone or, at the most, with 1 other person, preferably in a sparsely populated theater(which shouldn't be a problem in another week or two!) in order to at least experience SOME eeriness and fear.  The best possible scenario at this point is to wait until it comes out on video, then watch it at night with all the lights in the house turned off, again either by yourself or with your boy/girlfriend or spouse(NOT A GROUP!)  The movie industry simply saturated the public TOO MUCH with the promos for this movie, and I'm angry with them and myself for buying into it.  This could have surpassed Night of the Living Dead in some cult circles, but Hollywood ruined it.",Null,0,1,16 August 1999
