Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode I- A Disappointment
","The Phantom Menace could have been a good movie.  The drawback is that Mr. Lucas lost sight of what made the first three Star Wars films so good.  In the first Star Wars trilogy the films were based on characters and plot. The Phantom Menace, on the other hand, tries to rely entirely on special effects.  The plot isn't good and the characters are not developed at all. The only upside is that the back story to the first three films is being told.  This could have been done in many ways, and probably should have been done in some other way, instead of making a disappoinging film that takes away from the power of the first trilogy.",1,1,3,2 January 2001
