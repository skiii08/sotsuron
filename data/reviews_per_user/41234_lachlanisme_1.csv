The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Expectations set to high.
","I wish i could say i loved this movie, i really do. The acting was excellent, Emma Watson was beautiful, the music was terrific and it was based on one of my favorite books. But somehow I was let-down. not that it was a bad movie, because it really wasn't, it was good, but i think they could have just made it a little bit longer, maybe just 15 minutes, just 10 more at the beginning (introducing characters and such) and then 5 minutes towards the end, when Charlie was recovering from his (breakdown). All in all i really did like 'The perks of being a wallflower' but i think it could still have been better. I'm probably a little bias because I love the book so dearly but i think the movie didn't quite do it justice, however they usually don't.",9,0,1,7 January 2013
