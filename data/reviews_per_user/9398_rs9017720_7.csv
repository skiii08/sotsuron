The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The most needless installment ever.
","I've never been a huge fan of the hunger games movies that came before this one, but I found them to be passable. However, this movie feels completely unnecessary. I cannot think of anything worth even mentioning in this movie, other than a solid final(?) performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman. I mark all of my reviews as spoilers, but I really can only think of one thing that could be considered a 'spoiler', but before that I want to talk about the 'smart' political schemes of this movie. Smart is in quotes because all they do is go around and film stuff the evil capitol has been doing. That's not that smart, to be honest. I mean effective, sure, but I could have thought of that and i barely pay attention to these movies when children aren't killing each other...(wow I'm a bad person). The only other thing that is done to fight the capital is make propaganda (like an 'evil' government would do) and when katniss shoots down TWO bombers with a *beep* arrow. Nice job, whoever designed those things. Oh yeah, and a bunch of people somehow got like a million bombs in the middle of the forest so a bunch of capitol soldiers could follow them, and the people could climb into the trees without being shot somehow, and blow up all the soldiers without a single tree starting on fire in a bloodless explosion and WHOSE PLAN WAS THIS!!! Also, some other people blow themselves up to destroy part of a dam to stop the capitol from getting electricity. Why did they do this, you might ask (after you ask where they are getting these bombs from)? Because they heard Katniss singing. Well I guess Jennifer Lawrence's singing career has gone down the toilet if her first song makes people blow themselves up. Anyway the capitol retaliates with a bombing that doesn't kill a single person (but Katniss' sister almost dies for a cat) as Katniss' other boyfriend and some nameless people go to rescue her other boyfriend and some people whose names I can't be bothered to remember (or care for). They're successful, but oh no! Peeta's evil now! This will surely be of some consequence... or the movie could just end. 4/10.",4,6,7,7 April 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Surprisingly great, but don't expect a Cloverfield sequel.
","Personally I have never been a big fan of the original Cloverfield. I was too young to get the viral marketing, and upon re-viewing it, I thought the story was basic, the characters were annoying, and the found-footage style was irritating. So suffice it to say I was absolutely fine with a 'blood-relative' of the first film as opposed to a direct sequel. And looking back, 10 Cloverfield Lane is better than the original in just about every way. The characters (and phenomenal actors) are much better, the cinematography is great, and the story is more original and interesting. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is an easy protagonist to latch onto, and John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr. are also phenomenal. The only negative aspect of this movie is really the fact that it seems to have nothing to do with the original Cloverfield, but even then, I am much more interested in a Cloverfield series that is more parts Twilight Zone one-offs than it is Godzilla (we have Godzilla for that). Its no masterpiece, but 10 Coverfield Lane is thoroughly enjoyable in about every aspect. 9/10",9,4,6,25 March 2016
Gone Girl," The biggest mixed bag of 2014
","I had high hopes for this movie, but that was probably because I knew nothing about it. I thought it would be a neo-noir, but in the end it plays out more as a thriller. In the first act, Nick realizes his wife, Amy, is gone and believes she has been kidnapped. He seems unshaken at first, which was to make the audience think he killed his wife. This is quite odd however, since in the end it was revealed that he had nothing to do with his wife's disappearance. As this goes on, his wife's diary entries are shown on screen which gives the audience an insight into the couple's past. At this point, I was still looking for small hints and clues in the text, but my attempts were all for naught. The press is outraged at Nick, and believe him to be the killer, but things get more complicated when it is revealed that Nick has been having an affair. This seemed out of character for our 'everyman', and I first saw it I raised an eyebrow, but its far from the least believable thing presented on screen. That would come when, halfway through the movie, it is revealed that Amy is alive, journal entries war lies, and she wants revenge on her husband for cheating on her. The movie wanted my jaw to drop, but instead, my eyebrow was raised. Her plan is to frame Nick for her murder in the most complicated way possible so that he goes to jail. Instead of just killing him, or whatever. Nick eventually realizes his wife's disappearance was a clever ploy and hires a lawyer, who gets people to track her down. This plot point is only addressed like, one time though, and never comes into play. However, while Amy is away, she is robbed and the pair who did it realize that there is something odd about her. This should have happened a long time ago since the two have watched reports of Amy's disappearance WITH HER IN THE ROOM but this plot point is also swept under the rug. Amy goes to a casino and, by pure coincidence, stumbles upon one of her exes. He takes her into his house because he's an idiot, and she slowly begins her plot to frame him as her kidnapper. For some reason. Seriously, her motivations can be pretty much summed up as 'I was CRAZY the whole time! (except when I wasn't)'. Meanwhile Nick wins over the press and people for apologizing for cheating on his wife. Amy see this and suddenly doesn't hate her husband any more (again, CRAZY! (maybe)) and kills the guy she was with. She then returns home and everyone believes her story, despite holes that even Nick points out. Even his lawyer and the detective working on the case just leave, fully knowing the truth about Amy. Amy then tells Nick she is pregnant with his sperm from the sperm bank and Nick decides to fake his love for her to rise his kid. Then one of the worst endings of all time happens. After all this buildup, the complicated plot, the suspenseÂ… it ends. The movie just, cuts off. This is not an ending you have to think about, either. the writers just didn't know how to end it, so they just did. What the hell. So the plot is full of holes, the characters change their entire personalities in the blink of an eye, and it's on the whole the second most overrated movie of the year (second only to Interstellar), but it is extremely suspenseful, well acted and beautifully shot with great music and a disturbing tone. On the whole, it really is the biggest mixed bag of last year's cinema.",6,1,4,16 February 2015
Jurassic World," A worthy but not perfect successor.
","By now just about everyone who wanted to see Jurassic World, the fourth installment in the inconsistent Jurassic Park saga has seen it. It's a huge success financially, but was it a success in my eyes? For the most part, yes! This is an action-horror movie at it's roots, much like the original, and has some new additions to the lore of Jurassic Park. While the previous two sequels felt like retreads, for the most part Jurassic World is a step in the right direction and feels fresh. The leads do a fairly good job, (even if sometimes the writing isn't great) and the effects are solid. I was extremely excited to return to Isla Nublar once more to see a fully functioning dinosaur theme park. However, as stated previously, there are some corny lines and the characters feel underdeveloped for the most part, but the spectacle of the park and feeling of adventure and tension overcome these flaws. There is also at least one touching scene featuring an animatronic similar to those made by the late Stan Winston that is very effective. The finale is a love letter to fans of the series, and I could not contain my excitement during the film's final act. In the end Jurassic World is not a perfect follow up to one of my personal favorite movies of all time, but I never expected it to be as good as the original, so I was fully satisfied. 7.5/10",7,7,17,2 September 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Unfortunately disappointing
","I enjoyed An Unexpected Journey. Its reception was fairly mixed, and for good reason. However, I was thrilled to be back in Middle Earth. Desolation of Smaug was even better in my opinion, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as the dragon, coupled with outstanding special effects made Smaug the best part of the series (closely followed by McClellan and Freeman's performances). My only real problem was the cliffhanger ending and sometimes obvious filler. However, this movie is almost all filler. The best part of this flick was the, uh, desolation of Smaug in the first 15 minutes or so. However, my favorite part of the series is quickly dispatched and afterward only filler is left, it seems. This movie was the shortest of the three, and it certainly felt like it, but this is the movie I wanted to be the LONGEST of them all, since it is the last of the Middle Earth films. I suppose the reason it felt short was because there was no substance to it. An infamous amount of CGI was used, but the real reason I felt so detached was probably because the conflict felt contrived.Dragon sickness comes out of nowhere, The Elf king wants his necklace suddenly, but just as quickly the Dwarfs and Elves become allies, only for the Elf king to again abandon the dwarfs. The actors did their parts well, and the characters friendships felt quite real, but not much else did. I wanted to enjoy this movie. I wanted this movie to completely convert those against the Hobbit series, and I never wanted the Middle Earth saga to end. But alas, end it did, and it may have almost done the opposite of what I wanted, as it came near to converting me to the side against the saga. It is with a heavy heart that I score this film a 5/10.",5,2,4,7 April 2015
Lucy," Hahaha- Wait, this isn't a comedy.
","I am no science expert. I really am not. The extent of my scientific career thus far involved my internship at the U of A's chemistry lab. But even I know that nothing in this movie makes sense. The main argument against this viewpoint is that the movie is 'supposed to be fun, not realistic'. To that I will first say, thank the lord, because even its central premise (the idea that humans use only 10% of their brains) is a complete myth. But its inaccuracy is not (only) what made it a bad movie. There is no plot. The entire plot can be summed up in- Hot girl gets a drug, hot girl gets smart (an inaccuracy in of itself), Chinese gangsters try to kill her. Not only his, but the entire film discusses how dumb and oblivious we are, and how the filmmakers are smarter than us, even though there's a scientific inaccuracy EVERY TWO MINUTES! None of the actors are all that great, Johansen is there to be a pretty face, Morgan Freeman is there for a paycheck, and everyone else is just not noteworthy. The best part of this movie was laughing at when a character said, 'The world's first woman was named Lucy', even though there is no concrete definition of a woman, 'Lucy' was not a human nor the first hominid, instead one of the earliest discovered ones, and she was not named Lucy until she was discovered, because of a song playing while she was discovered (Lucy in the sky with diamonds). The only way this movie could be good is if it is viewed as a 'so bad its good' flick. Oh, and the cinematography is slick at times. neither of those factors were any where new enough to redeem this movie.",3,2,6,24 February 2015
The Great Gatsby," An uninspired version of Fitzgerald's classic
","F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel aptly named The Great Gatsby has been often recognized as the greatest American novel. It took me a year to finally get around to seeing it's film counterpart, and I was immensely disappointed. Whether you love the novel, hate it, or simply admire the way it captured the Jazz age, this movie has all of about nothing to offer you. The movie, to sum up, seems to spend more of its budget and attention on the senses, specifically sight and sound, than profound storytelling. For example, New York has become a brightly colored, CGI party, with colors bursting off of the screen similar to Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge or many of Zach Snyder's comic book adaptations. This is all fine and good, (though it is a huge misrepresentation of the era, which was more of a cover for bad times to come in the thirties) the film ends up losing its focus. There are constant odd jumps in shots, almost always happening in the middle of a character's sentence, seeming to illustrate my point further. However all of this may have been acceptable were it not for the performances. Apart from Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays an excellent Gatsby, everyone's dialogue and performance feels overdone. This is especially true of Maguire, who plays an alcoholic who gives unbearable monologues that sound, well as bad as they were in Raimi's Spider-Man films. In other words, he talks in a disinterested grumble through half the movie and makes random pauses that even Calculon would detest. Apart from these two, the other characters feel generic and boring, a mere shadow to those presented in Fitzgerald's third novel. The ending is quite foreboding, if nothing different for those who have read the novel, but it makes several characters bitterly unlikeable, a problem I had with the source material as well. The ending is tragic, the visuals are fantastic, but the film has too little an attention span and too poor performances to make this movie recommendable.",4,1,3,15 January 2015
