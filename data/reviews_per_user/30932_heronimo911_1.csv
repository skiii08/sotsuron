Skyfall," Excellent Choice for the Role of EVE
","Thought Naomie Harris as Eve is excellent- she was , sexy,thoughtful,surprising, a super talent- great actor. loved her performance. Look forward to seeing her in Mandala.Judi Dench is as always a great M, Mr. Craig as James Bond takes Bond to an other level of performance. Do I prefer his role as Bond to Sean Connery's? I don't think so- but it is very different. A black or Asian JB in the future? why not there is some great British talent from the black and Asian communities.I'm pleased Sam Mendes had the foresight to pick Miss Harris for one of the lead roles.I would recommend Skyfall as one of the best movies of 2012 It is great to see British film production at it's best, from the crew ,gaffer teams to sound and super camera work.",10,16,44,25 October 2012
