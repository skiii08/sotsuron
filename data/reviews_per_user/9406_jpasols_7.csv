It," I lOVE IT! NOT A REMAKE!
","First of all let me make you all be aware...VERY aware since none of you seem to be...IT (2017) is NOT, I repeat NOT! a reboot! It is simply another film adaptation of the Stephen King book, this movie is not trying to be anything like the 1990 miniseries (which I must say aged very poorly and is hardly watchable for me anymore). However IT (2017) was a thrilling, entertaining, funny, and bloody ride! This film made you feel a variety of different emotions throughout the two hours! Happy, Sad, Silly, Scared, Disturbed, etc...And it all fits nicely together, not enough humor to make it a straight comedy, it's still a frightening film! Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise was by far the BEST casting I've ever seen!!! I can't think of anyone else who could have pulled off Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise!!! Even Tim Curry's Pennywise ain't got nothing on 2017 Pennywise!!!! Bill Skarsgard brought the character of Pennywise a HUGE fear factor rather than the 1990 movie did, In this film Pennywise is more intimidating and terrifying, yet still friendly looking and playful and I even got a hint of sweetness of Pennywise during the Georgie scene in the beginning! Pennywise made a terrifying attempt to connect with the boy and laugh with him and actually talk to him and kinda get to know him a bit...yet at the same time that's very disturbing because you KNOW what's about to come! It builds up the suspense and anticipation and before you know it, Pennywise's sharp fangs emerge from his mouth and he's biting Georige's arm off! This scene was terrifying especially since they showed Georgie crawling across the street with one arm and the other gushing blood! Very disturbing, sickening, frightening, and unsettling. That opening scene is one hell of a way to begin a horror film/novel and really PULLS the audience in right then and there. Bill Skarsgard A++++++++ for your acting of Pennywise!!! It was the absolute best!!!!
Now moving onto the kids in this film! O absolutely ADORE the new cast of the losers club! Way more than I did in the 1990 movie! They were all so annoying in the 90s version! Except for young Beverley Marsh of course. But I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE New Beverly Marsh played by the wonderfully talented and beautiful Sophia Lillis!! She did an amazing job as Beverly Marsh and her acting was through the roof!!! By far my FAVORITE of the 2017 Losers club! Then there's Bill Denbrough, played in this film by Jaeden Lieberher, who I thought was another amazing young actor who really NAILED the character of young Bill. The stuttering was perfect! Not too much, not too little either. Just right and he nailed it! When Bill had his mental breakdown scenes about Georgie you could actually FEEL his pain! His acting was so real I felt his pain of losing his little brother, feeling guilty about his death, and his parents becoming distant and strange after the tradgety. You can feel Bill's world turning completely upside down and on top of everything that happens in Bill's home life, he has to deal with a bully at school named Henry Bowers, as well as an evil shapeshifting demon clown picking off all the local children of Derry!!! Damn...rough life!. Last main character I want to mention in the losers Club is Ritchie Tozier played in this film by Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things)...Finn did an amazing job of Ritchie Tozier, he was definitely the funniest character of the lot and he's the legit reason why this movie was funnier than it should have been! But honestly in my opinion any scene that featured Pennywise was legit Terrifying!!!! Ritchie was funny yeah but when Pennywise was in frame it was nothing but FEAR!!.
Moving onto the CGI effects, a lot of the effects were good for the most part! There were some scenes throughout this film that relied just a tad too much on CGI and it killed certain scenes a little bit! Other than that I'd say 97% of the CGI effects for this film are pretty solid.
One last thing I wanted to touch on with this film is the soundtrack score!. The score was amazing! (Forgive me i cant remember the name of the man who composed this soundtrack) but he did an amazing job! The soundtrack really set the atmosphere of the film and setting! The score was many things, it was happy, heart warming, and terrifying and dark! The scene where the leper is chasing Eddie into the yard of the creepy house and the soundtrack that plays right there with the hardcore horror beats was amazing!!! Especially watching it in theaters!
Overall, IT (2017) truly is an amazing modern day horror film! Pennywise is back for the new generation and he's absolutely terrifying!!!! I highly recommend this movie to horror fans or movie goers in general! A great film you dont wanna skip out on rather you're skeptical about this movie or not (judging from the trailer). If you havent seen this movie yet even after a year of its release but have been debating on watching it...just do yourself a favor and watch it! Dont let the negative reviews scare you off! Over half of the negative reviews on here for this film are pathetic and give no REAL reason why this is a bad movie. This film really shouldn't receive anything below a 6.5. Also for people who keep saying this movie is nothing like the book...you too are also wrong! I wonder if half of the people saying that has even read the book themselves! This film is VERY accurate to the novel WAY more than the 1990 movie which took this story in it's own direction. The 2017 version of IT is seriously very accurate to the novel and Stephen King himself even said this film was truly amazing!. So argue with the author of the novel himself the next time you wanna say this movie isnt book accurate! This movie is accurate!!! And it's very good and scary! Definitely check it out!!!!! If you've actually read the book and paid attention to it then you SHOULD like this new adaptation!!!! You'll float too!!!My rating for IT (2017): Solid 10 out of 10 (no exaggeration!)",10,2,3,10 May 2019
Hereditary," Lived up to the hype and quotes as seen in the trailer!
","Hereditary is seriously terrifying! My favorite horror film of 2018 followed by Halloween 2018 just because I'm a long time follower of the Halloween series. Anyway, back to this truly horrifying film, Hereditary is the story of a family who is thrust into a terrible and inescapable nightmare beginning with the death of the matriarch (the grandmother of the kids, and the mother of Toni Collete's character 'Annie'). The entire first half of the film is simply building the suspense and creating fantastic character development, the first half of the film also fills the audience with high tensions and complete dread which pays off in the second half of the film. The second half of the film (once the movie has you sucked into its horrifying vortex of non-stop madness) takes a much sinister turn as Annie as well as her sixteen year old son, Peter (played by Alex Wolfe) begin to discover the true terrifying secret of the family ancestry. Annie discovers that her late mother was apart of a cult which worshipped a demon named King Paimon, one of the eight kings of hell, (which also is the name of a REAL demon, not just a demon the director made up). After Annie finds out that a demonic force is after her son Peter to possess his body to enter the real world, Annie tries to desperately stop the madness by destroying her late daughter, Charlie's (played by Milly Sphario) sketch book, which is some kind of gateway for King Paimon.There's the giant gist of this terrifying film. Now my thoughts and review for this film is that first off I HAVE to give a HUGE shout out to an outstanding performance by Toni Collette! Collete NAILED this movie and I absolutely loved her in this! You really feel for her character and you can see how much she's going through and how hard she tries to keep her family together and her sanity in check while in the meantime she loses her 13 year old daughter, Charlie, in a violent car accident caused by Peter, and also trying to find her place as a mother, a wife, and used to be daughter (before her Satanist mom passed away). In a scene in the film, Annie talks about her childhood and how she has dealt with death before, her brother hung himself because he was depressed and kept claiming their mom kept trying to 'put people inside of him', Annie's father passed away after he starved himself to death. So as for the character Annie, there are so many reasons to feel bad for her and Toni Collette absolutely MASTERS this role, I literally can't think of anyone better to play this role.The cinematography was astonishing and mesmerizing as well as eerie, the music score was absolutely dreadful, terrifying, and extremely bone-chilling. The story (plot) of this film is terrifically terrifying, gripping, Disturbing, and dreadful. What really makes this drama/supernatural suspense/horror film work is that there are NO cheesy jump scares, this film simply relies on the suspense, the dread, the mystery, and the psychological elements to get to the audiences deepest fears. It's a film that really gets into your head and once you see it once...theres no forgetting it. The heart stopping and frightening images will stick with you forever!. If you're reading negative reviews for this film IGNORE THEM! this movie IS terrifying and those who are saying it isn't are the type of people who rely on cheesy jump scares and lots and lots of action and Gore. This is not that kind of movie so dont be expecting that from Hereditary. BUT if you're looking for a film that will TRULY scare you to the core and get deep inside your head and will provide you with horror that will stick with you forever...Hereditary is definitely for you!!My final rating for Hereditary: 10 out of 10 Stars. No I'm not exaggerating. This film truly is that great! Watch for yourself!.",10,0,4,23 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Very Book Accurate and Enjoyable!!
",Today I watched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) for the first time in nearly ten years!!!! I felt the same exact nostalgia as I did when i very first saw it! This film adaptation of J.K. Rowling's novel is VERY accurate! Nearly every scene and every line from the novel is in this movie! If you're one who LOVES film adaptations of books then Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is definitely for you!!! As well as the 7 sequels of the film series are also very accurate to the books. Give this magical movie a watch!!!.,10,1,1,31 May 2019
Halloween," BEST horror film EVER MADE!!!!!
","Halloween (1978) is truly the best horror film EVER to be made! I don't even know where to start on reviewing this film! Halloween is what started me on the horror genre. It was my very first horror film and very first R Rated movie. This is a solid flick with a great simple plot, amazing characters, amazing cast members, and phenomenal acting. Now some people out there say this movie is over-hyped and overrated, well sorry you don't know what a truly amazing horror film is. Not to mention I can't wait for the 2018 sequel to this movie! If you for some strange reason have not seen this absolutely flawless film, do yourself a huge favor and watch it! And if don't like this movie, then you seriously got screws loose in your head.",10,0,1,10 June 2018
The Croods," My favorite Animated film of Recent Time!
","The Croods truly is one of the best animated family films of the modern age. I enjoyed every second of this movie and I have watched it over and over analyzing the characters more and more and the stunning colorful and glowing visuals. The movie really is a treat for all ages, it's hilarious and very moving. Highly recommended from me with an A+ rating and 10/10 score.",10,3,5,28 September 2018
The Purge," Not What I Was Hoping For
","I'm gonna go ahead and agree with the majority of the reviews on this film. Great concept but really fails to deliver because the entire movie takes place inside a house where a wealthy family is hunted by a mob outside their house after they take in a bloody stranger who was running from the mob. The mob tells the family they must return their escaped victim alive or else they will kill him and the entire family. Okay well there's your story for this film. I was expecting a ton of chaos, blood on the streets and a bunch of riots. But nope we never see that in this one. If that's the kind of horror action you're looking for then I recommend it's sequels, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year.Now for the positive review on this film I actually did find it to be quite suspenseful at certain scenes. The violence was pretty solid as well as the bloody scenes.Now do I recommend this to horror fans? Yeah sure I'd say go ahead and watch it at least once or maybe twice.
Do I recommend to suspense/thriller fans? Yes definitely! This is your type of movie!.Me as a total horror buff my final rating for Blumhouse's 'The Purge' is a 6/10 rating.",6,0,3,22 October 2018
Alien: Covenant," Easily my favorite Alien film of the franchise!!!
","This is my favorite Alien film since the very original. It's highly entertaining and gory (which, as a horror buff I highly enjoyed). Some genuinely creepy and disturbing scenes and great character development. For the 6th entry in a sci-fi horror franchise I was pleasantly and surprisingly impressed with Alien: Covenant. The ending is clearly left open for a sequel which will maybe complete the pre-planned trilogy of the Alien prequel series which began with 2012's Prometheus. I'm excited for what Ridley Scott has up his genius sleeves next!. Great film. Highly recommend for sci-fi fans, horror fans, Gore buffs, or movie goers in general. Don't let all the bad reviews drive you away from this truly amazing film. Especially if you're new to the Alien series.My rating for Alien: Covenant. 10 out of 10.",10,7,13,6 November 2018
