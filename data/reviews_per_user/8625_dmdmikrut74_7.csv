Casablanca," Casablanca
",Casablanca is the typical love story over shadowed by World War II. The film keeps you guessing till the end and even then you're not sure what is going to happen. Even though it was my first time seeing it i would watch it again because somewhere a part of me left connected to all the characters the one you love coming back into your life when you least expect it and doing what is right for them even when you know that it's not what you want to do but you have to. I would recommend the film to anyone who hasn't seen it and those who have I truly thought when I started watching it that i wasn't going to enjoy it then as it was ending i wanted to see more and didn't want it to end.,Null,1,2,18 October 2011
The Birth of a Nation," The Birth of a Nation
",The film was very well done for the time period that it was made in. The way that Griffith made close up and far away shots by putting a circle around the people or scene that he was trying to make. The music all the way through the film also helped narrate the film and help explain what was going on or what was going to happen next by the change in music.The other thing that I saw helpful was the stage directions about what was happening or what was said during the scene. The beginning of the movie was a little slow up to the point just before the Civil War and then after that it moved along but became very graphic during the reconstruction part of the film. I probably wouldn't recommend the film to a normal person a history major or someone very interested in American history I would recommend the film to.,Null,0,2,14 September 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath
",The movie was a very good representation of what it was like during the Great Depression. It held my interest and kept me wondering what was going to happen to the characters next. The little girls were funny and kept everyone's spirits high when they would get excited over the simplest things. The Grandfather was funny because he was old and wanted to do things his way and not leave. The night scenes were done again very well especially when in the creek. In the end when Tom was leaving was a little dragged out and when the family made it into California was a little boring and drawn out again. But all in all it was a very good movie and i would recommend it to anyone who has or hasn't read the novel.,Null,0,0,7 October 2011
The Graduate," The Graduate
",The movie was great! It kept me laughing and wondering what was going to happen next. Dustin Hoffman was great he was the perfect person to play Ben. Most people can relate to his feelings getting out of college and not knowing what to do and just taking life as it comes.The time lapsing in the film was done very well to show how much time had past through the months. The generation gap was present and could be seen through the parents of both families. The ending was the best. It was what you expected but then in another way it was kind of a shock back into the world they were living in. That people can also relate with because when they realize that things are not going to go as planned its like what do we do now? type of reaction.,Null,0,0,6 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," I'm singing and dancing in the rain
",I don't normally like musicals though I haven't seen one in a while this one was enjoyable. The humor throughout the whole thing made it fun and laughable at most points. There were some serious parts but then those got turned into song and dance which again made the movie upbeat again. I used to dance so I found the dancing incredible the costumes were perfect for every scene. I can't imagine how much work was put into the movie which makes it all the more amazing. To anyone who isn't sure if they like musicals or is just looking for a film to go watch and laugh at I highly recommend this film I will definitely be watching this one again soon.,Null,0,1,3 November 2011
Psycho," Psycho
",I have to say this movie kept my attention. I have seen the re make and I enjoyed seeing the first one. It had the same guess whats going to happen and be wrong that some horror films still have today. The shower scene was done well the back and fourth camera shots really was good for the effect of the killing.The woman's first nigh at the motel would have been enough to make me want to leave. The story line was believable in the sense that this could happen to anyone any place anytime. It's a classic in my eyes and I will recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen the re make or the original. I can now see watching more of Alfred Hitchcock just to see what else he has come up with.,Null,0,0,14 November 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
",The first few times I watched the film I didn't like it. Then I had to read the book in high school and didn't because it was almost like the movie. But Jack Nicholson is great he adds the normal and realistic believable quality not just to this film but to many of his other films as well. The story line and the acting is portrayed very well and it's all smooth and all the characters fit together. It's a great story to show that some people in institutions may not be crazy and it just takes one person to show them all that.Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched was perfect and acted so well and showed that she wanted to be the one in control and as McMurphy tested her authority she began to become unnerved by the patients.,Null,0,1,7 December 2011
