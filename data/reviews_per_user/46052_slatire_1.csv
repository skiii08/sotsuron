The Devil's Advocate," Didn't think much at first, a year later I loved the dialog
","I guess a year ago I was put off by Keanu Reeves being in this film and this tainted my viewing, but then, when does he not. Seeing this film again, I was more impressed by Al Pacino's rendition of some excellent scriptlettes and the deliciously bad sex appeal it offers. Only Al could perform these soliloquies; he made the hair on my neck stand up with his performance of these intelligent, cutting perceptions of the {sic} fat, vane, bloated world we live in today. Not a word was wasted. This film is sexy too, with a careful casting of beautiful yet slightly demonic-looking women not afraid to show you how big or small their nipples can get. All in all this is a.. better film than it first seems. The script makes up for Keanu's predictable 'acting' (what's new). Not in my top 50 but it's definitely in the top 100.",5,2,6,1 July 2005
