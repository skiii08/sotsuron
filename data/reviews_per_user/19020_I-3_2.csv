The Blair Witch Project," Scary
","OH MY GOD! This movie is so scary...The only movie that could ever top this in scaryness is The shining! No Scream or I know what you did last summer could ever win this. The actors are so real in everything they do and the whole plot is so good! There hasn't been a scary movie,that actually scares you, done is such a long time that this was good fun! I want no sequels done to this movie, that would only ruin the whole thing! GO SEE IT!",10,1,2,26 November 1999
Good Will Hunting," Sleepy, anyone?
","Oh no. This is such a bad movie. It is so boring! I don't need movies with explosions but this movie needs one, bad. I mean nothing is interesting in GWH. I fell asleep in the theatre looking at this and my friend had to wake me up in the end. Go see this if you are suffering from insomnia, I promise you will fall asleep. One thing is good, that it's not as long as Titanic, you needn't suffer for that long.",1,33,69,27 February 2000
