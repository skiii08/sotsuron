The Incredible Hulk," An excellent balance between action and drama.
","In my opinion this movie could very well be a first movie in a saga, a re-imagining of The Incredible Hulk franchise, or even a sequel to Ang Lee's Hulk. I may be one of the very few who liked Hulk, but this is a great counterpart to that movie. It explores more of the Hulk mythos, and in the process gives the audience an expertly balanced movie. As well, it provides many avenues in which Marvel can explore in other movies. As a casual fan, this movie may be on par with this summer's earlier entry, Iron Man, in it's intensity and amazing performances. The CGI work is done with great detail, down to facial hair, and veins, and most noticeably, a more realistic look for the Incredible Hulk. I believe this installment of the Hulk character benefits from the learned successes and pitfalls of other Marvel characters.",8,2,7,13 June 2008
