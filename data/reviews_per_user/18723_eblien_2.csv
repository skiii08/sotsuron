Skyfall," Great but then not so great
","Craig is good as James Bond, the movie is great, gorgeous picture, sound, very entertaining, all is super great, except ..... Bond and MI6 is not supposed to be this stupid, to make endless rows of unintelligent and unmotivated decisions. The movie was well worth my time to watch, thanks for still doing this, absolutely, but I though to myself, and this is no spoiler, again and again: 'WHAT!? why did they do THAT? why did he WAIT? why did they go ALONE? why did they do all these stupid things, just to create suspense? I would have given the movie 7/10 or even 8/10 if it were not for the stupidity of the plot. Come on!",6,1,7,16 March 2014
Gravity," Not believable at all
","If you can switch off your common sense and just look at the visuals then you can maybe massively enjoy this adventure, preferably on a big screen. 3D was nice too.But it made me kind of sad that it wasn't remotely believable. People tend to think 'it's only a movie, take it for what it is'. Yes, but even Star Wars needs to be believable within its own universe, and it is! Even James Bond, most of the time. A movie like Gravity cannot take short cuts on the laws of physics.To illustrate my point: My 10 year old son pointed out to me halfway through what I had noticed all the way, that things didn't make sense. Minor SPOILER to follow: Like when Clooney and Bullock is hanging by some wires like there are gravity involved or like they are dragged behind the space station in motion. Eh? One of them even bouncing back and the other 'falling', or was that wind because they were too close to the atmosphere? It sure didn't look that way. If the idea here was to develop the story then there are so many ways it could be done so much more believable. It's like the film makers think 'sure they wont notice'. Well we do.I gave it 6/10 just because of the visuals and the overall feeling, drifting around in orbit, despite awful dialog, despite Bullock and the physics going mentally insane.",6,3,5,1 May 2014
