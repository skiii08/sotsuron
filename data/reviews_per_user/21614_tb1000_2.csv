The Rock," one of the best action movies of the 1990's!
","This is definitely a great movie.  Yes, the action is great, but the performances are more a reason to watch this movie.Nicolas Cage, coming off his big Oscar win at the time, is Stanley Goodspeed, a bio-chemist for the FBI.  He's pretty much a regular, goofy guy, without any combat experience, which shows throughout the movie, and leads to some funny scenes.Ed Harris, Hummel, is the maniac in the movie, not as typical as you may think as the movie goes on.  He's employed some of his marine friends to help with heist, taking over Alcatraz and taking hostages, while threatening to launch rockets with VX gas at San Francisco.Sean Connery puts in a great performance as Mason, the wrongfully-charged prisoner, who was put in jail without a trial.  He's rightfully pissed, so obviously it takes a little to get him to guide the Navy Seals through The Rock, to overtake Hummel and his men.The movie consists of many action sequences, that do not seem pointlessly thrown in like in other movies, but flow with the plot.  The story is pretty cool and is executed quite good.  Michael Bay really shines as the director, excellently using his low-angle shots, really showcasing what is going on in the scene.  Definitely a must-see for action movie fans.",10,1,1,20 July 2001
Coyote Ugly," better than you would think
","Coyote Ugly is definitely a movie that you wouldn't expect much from, but surprises you along the way.I must say this was my first time seeing Piper Perabo, and she completely amazed me for a little known and little experienced actress.  Only unfortunate thing is that she didn't sing in the movie.  Jerry Bruckheimer thought that her voice 'was too low'.  But what the hell?  Didn't effect the movie at all because, you really believed it was her singing.  I couldn't tell.  Anyway, she was perfect for this role, gracing it with the sincerity and innocence it needed, to become believable as the small-town girl, trying to make it in the big city as a song writer.  Definitely expect great performances from her in the future.Maria Bello was great and believable in her 'strong-woman' role as the owner of the Coyote Ugly bar.  Andy Garcia also surprised me, with a decent performance as Violet Sanford's love interest in the film.  John Goodman stood out with a surprisingly decent comedic role as Violet's overweight father.  And as for Tyra Banks ... well, she was OK, i guess.  Didn't mind her that much, although the only reason she's in this movie is for a little star power to grace the movie posters and trailers.All in all, the movie was decent.  For me, the highlights were Piper Perabo 'singing' and her scenes with Andy Garcia.",7,1,1,20 July 2001
