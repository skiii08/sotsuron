The Avengers," One of the smartest, wittiest, grandest summer blockbuster you will see for a long time !
","Before I saw avengers I was expecting to see a action heavy film with little or no script. And now that i have seen it I can say that i was very surprised by the dialogues and the script. The script was witty, smart and well written. The main plot was of course simple, that of a man( in this case a God) wanting to take over the world, but apart from that clich√© plot point the script was very good. It was more character based than plot based. The movie gave enough individual time to the heroes(other than hawkeye) in terms of screen time. The point of the film was a team assembling and that team dynamic was brilliantly written and acted. The heroes fought, they disagreed, they had different opinions to things, they had different reasons to go to war, but at the end despite their differences they came together. This team dynamic was brilliantly handled by Joss Whedon. The script was funny at times as well, Joss whedon knew that the avengers wasn't supposed to be a dark knight, it wasn't supposed to be realistic and gritty and scattered with various themes, so instead of making a mindless michael bay film he added his own unique touches which gave the movie and the characters depth while also preserving the summer blockbuster flavour. Each character played a specific part in this team, captain America played the loyal/bound by duty super soldier who turns out to be a brilliant tactician as well. Iron man provided the team with flying abilities and brilliant weaponry, thor had personal reasons to fight this battle, while HULK well he was an unstoppable monster! The scope of this film is huge, unlike any other super hero film. The opposition that these heroes faced could not be dealt by one hero alone and hence the stakes in this movie are much higher and the heroes know that. Some realistic themes were also introduced like whether SHIELD should make nuclear weapons to protect itself from the other worldly armies, these themes were quite relevant in today's times. There were quite a few smart writing choices that whedon made that i cant talk about without giving spoilers. The acting as expected was brilliant. Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Mark Rufallo, Scarlett Johanson,Chris hemsworth and Jeremy renner were all brilliant at their roles. The black widow got more screen time then i expected but that was welcome. The action I thought was very large scale, although i think and i know many might disagree with me, but the action could have been more grander in some parts. All in all this movie was everything it was supposed to be. It balanced the script,the dialogues,the characters and the action very well. Don't compare this to the dark knight cause this is not supposed to be gritty and intense, just be happy that the movie gives to you more than you expected it to. I don't know how Marvel is going to top this but lets just hope they do.",8,2,6,3 May 2012
