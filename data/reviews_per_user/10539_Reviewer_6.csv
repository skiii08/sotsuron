Vertigo," Did everyone notice the second plot twist!!!?????
","Vertigo is the greatest movie ever made. The acting, drama, set design, lighting, plot and script are first class. This movie was robbed of the Oscars in 1958! However I'm not going to describe the movie as it MUST be seen. But for those who have seen it did you notice the second more subtle plot twist? It occurs after the scene when Scottie is in the hospital suffering from a mental breakdown. Notice how Midge does not appear in the movie again! In fact, the second half of the movie after that point, we are actually seeing what is going through Scottie's head and how he copes with his circumstances. Notice also that when the main Jury person is speaking he says that Scottie's previous weakness made the policeman fall to his death. You see Scottie comes to terms with his personal disasters by assuming the role of the person he could not save. What I mean is that it was the policeman who was hanging from the roof in reality but Scottie could not save him because he was looking down at the officer. He later reverses roles with Mrs Madeline Elster after the hospital scene. Now tell me how much of a genius Hitchcock really was!",10,4,4,3 December 1999
Forrest Gump," The greatest movie ever made - and why it won the Oscars!!!
","A number of users have mentioned that The Shawshank Redemption (TSR) should have won the best picture Oscar over Forrest Gump (FG). This type of criticism is unjustified when you realise the various reason why FG actually won the Oscars!!! 1) The title Forrest Gump is a bit misleading as the movie is not really about FG as it first seems for the average viewer, rather it is about us the audience who are supposed to be normal but we act in real life even worse than FG. 2) FG is laughing at us as we laugh at him. We see him as abnormal, but when Forrest tries to understand us he finds out that normal people cause so much pain in the world towards other people. This is clearly shown with the short clips of political and social history throughout the movie which the viewing audience in the cinema failed to recognise. This helps to prove FG case against normal people. 3) The movie can be interpreted in so many different ways that every time a viewer watches it they get a different version of what Forrest sees and understands and what it means for human nature as a whole. Only Forrest seems normal in the movie, while others are killing pop stars and important people in society. Forrest can't understand why normal people do this, as for me personally I agree with Forrest on this issue. 4) While Forrest is telling his story of events in his life, many of the viewing audience thought it was literally happening, but because some of the events described are surreal in its feel many people thought the movie was silly. Yet it was the viewers who were silly as they see things through Forrest's eyes not their own. Equally the viewer misses many of the important aspects of the movies' message because they fail to go into Forrest's world and explore.Misinterpretation that the viewer makes: 1) The running scene though at first seeming stupid is in fact one of the most thought provoking scenes ever in the history of movie making, but the average viewer does not realise this, because he/she cannot think broadly. This scene shows that normal people are stupid to follow people in the media as icons thinking they are clever people because they seem to be doing something special. What Forrest shows is that famous people are just as brainy as every else. But we normal people worship politicians in vain and others stars to sort out our world problems. 2) When Forrest is speaking at a rally against Vietnam, again people in real life follow anybody who has a big mouth without really understanding what they are saying - so profound as well as funny. 3) Jenny only realises that Forrest is the right person for her when it is too late, you should not judge on appearances, rather the character.The Movie also shows how normal people bully others, rape and child abuse children, start wars, use people and discriminate others. Forrest does not do any of these things, yet we as the viewer call him abnormal. For me, this is the most innovative movie I have ever seen as it has duped the world to think it is about Forrest rather than themselves.",10,1,4,10 March 1999
American History X," The acting was as great as the flaws (Spoilers Included)
","Please note that these comments include spoilers, so if you have not seen this movie do not read on.The acting in this movie as have been already said was great - enough said I think. Of course this was helped by a great script as well in many respects. However this movie should not be regarded as a classic because of the following flaws in plot design and characterisation. 1) At the beginning of the movie, Derek seems to have a valid right to protect his property against those black people who were stealing from him. It would have been best if the movie depicted the black people just sitting on his wall and talking and then Derek got mad and did what he did.2) The middle part of the movie is a complete disaster. The prison scenes were the biggest let down in the movie without a doubt. How Derek quickly made friends with that black convict is unrealistic considering that he rejected mixing with the other blacks in the prison. His conversion and realisation of his criminal activity was too quick and non-existent or simply to unrealistic. When Derek is raped in the shower we see that he has suffered physically, but mentally we do not see how he copes with this harrowing situation. 3) When Derek makes his racist arguments there is no counter comments made throughout the movie, therefore the viewer is totally confused how Derek could have changed.4) When Derek slaps the face of the leader of the Neo-Nazi organisation, we do not see the leader reacting against Derek afterwards by going around to Derek's place (like in many scenes in the Godfather movies) with his henchmen. Rather we get an unrealistic ending which involves a side incident that occurs in the movie, rather than the main purpose.This movie is worth watching, but misses out on the classical status because of its flaws - hence no best picture norm in the oscars. Only if these flaws could have been dealt with then it would have been one of the greatest movies of all time.",8,0,0,30 September 1999
Toy Story 2," Better than the first one.
",This is an incredible return of the fab characters. I loved every moment of the film. It was made even better because it was so emotional in parts. It provide great laughs and had awesome animations. Watching this movie made me believe that this should have got a best picture normination.,10,0,1,15 March 2000
Life Is Beautiful," Just as good as Forrest Gump - Perhaps
","La Vite e Bella is the type of movie that if you liked Forrest Gump (FG) you will love this. Both movies have the exterior vision of merely being a romantic comedy. Yet internally, both movies are talking and expressing very serious subject matters. With FG we see a) How disabled people can contribute to society and other people's lives. b) The movie FG is more about us as normal people than it was about FG. Normal people kill pop stars and politicians, child abuse children, use drugs and generally hurt others through words. With La Vita e Bella, the message is not about war, but how do you protect sensitive people to the violence and insanity around them. We do it everyday with violent TV progs and films. How do you control what young children watch and hear? To what extent will it affect them? Should we lie to our children to protect them from the outside world? The movie also shows true romance and love no matter how bad your situation is. The movie is not saying that lying is a way out of tricky situations, rather change the situation into a parable or a game like what Christ did to lessen the impact upon others. This movie is a 10/10 classic and deserves the Oscars hands down for its creativity, originality  and being able to place two movies into one effortlessly.",10,1,3,12 March 1999
The Sixth Sense," Nearly as good as Vertigo
",The 6th sense is one of the best build up movies around with a plot twist that is second only to Vertigo. Of course the little boy actor should be norminated for an oscar - but will he? For those of you who have not seen Vertigo (as the 6th sense movie takes many things from it) then go buy a copy now of the 1958 Hitchcock classic - you will be reviewing what happened in this movie in the end as you did with The 6th Sense.,9,0,0,22 November 1999
