The Avengers," An Epic Letdown
","Before I say everything that was wrong with the movie, I will first say that I am familiar with the comics and source material, and have thought all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies so far were decent. My personal favorite is Ironman 1, one of my favorite movies overall, because of the way it told the story and how it maintained more realism than the other movies in the franchise series of Marvel movies. Physics, engineering, and basic foundations of life were followed while telling the story of Tony Stark. Everything, while elaborate, seemed possible. Possible is the key word.I grew up watching Bill Bixby be the Incredible Hulk with Lou and thought the show was awesome. I do know, though, that technology wasn't around the make Hulk be what the comic wanted him to be. The Hulk movie therefore was decent but nothing I am dying to watch again. Captain America and Thor were decent too.So what was I expecting when I saw Avengers? I was expecting the 1992 Dream Team. I was expecting a movie that would be epic in every way where each character was maximized to their fullest while trying to solve a deep plot similar to The Watchmen or even the recent Dark Knight Trilogy. I got neither. The plot, in my opinion, was way too simplified and even worse, all the characters seemed to be more forgettable.I will say some of the casting was quite poor and didn't flow with the original intent of the characters and some were just annoying in their roles. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, in particular, were very unwatchable even though like Lost in Translation and The Hurt Locker.Overall, I can see how this movie made so much money. It is the perfect movie to take younger kids and comic book fans. It is actually even better for those that don't know the source material because they are coming into the movie fresh. However, this is no Dark Knight type of movie with the depth of plot, real-world story lines, or the perfect casting. I give it 7/10 and hope Avengers 2 is a lot better executed.",7,4,9,4 June 2013
Gravity," In a World of Remakes and Sequels, Gravity Brings Originality!
","Let's be honest. The movie theater is filled with remakes and sequels and ideas that are more or less redone to death. Even the dozen trailers I saw before watching gravity had at least 3-4 movies that were clearly remakes.Gravity is a movie that you see if at the very least to take advantage of 3D technology which fits very few movies. This is one of them. The visual effects and 3D are some of the best ever. The movie doesn't use 3D quite as good as Avatar, but it definitely holds it own. You believe you are with the characters and at some points you feel like you are actually in outer space.The movie is short by modern standards but it feels like the perfect length. You aren't wishing the movie last longer but don't feel like you are short-changed.The sound is great and if you can find a premium sound system like Regal RPX 3D, then you are in for an epic ride.The acting is great and Sandra Bullock definitely deserves an Oscar nomination.While people want to mention about the physics errors and flaws in the movie, I say it only shows how great everything else is about this movie. It is like arguing why Godfather is bad because Michael Corleone shouldn't look so handsome being a war hero and all.Overall, see this movie while it is in theaters and in 3D. I have a feeling it won't be as epic when it arrives on DVD/Blu-Ray. It will only be a very good movie instead.9/10",9,7,10,15 October 2013
Suicide Squad," Poorly Edited, Weak Script, Terrible Character Development.
","I had high expectations and had August 4th marked on my calendar for months. Also, I'm a big DC fan but also like Marvel too (especially X-Men). I like Margot Robbie and of course Will Smith. I went into a sold out auditorium of 150+ fans. I just ate Chipotle. I was excited. Despite RT reviews and word of mouth disappointment, I was READY! Zzz...Zzz...Zzz...What happened? The movie started off OK, but the plot is absolutely terrible. Who approved of this script? It appears they spent more time and money on the trailers and the text color effects than actually developing a script that fans and casual fans would want to sit 2 hours through.This movie is a complete mess. While the cast is decent, the character development isn't. While the soundtrack is decent, the dialogue wasn't. And what is up with the villain? Overall, this movie has too many unfamiliar characters within a far too short movie length, a confusing villain most DC fans don't even know much about, and stars that almost seem miscast. As a DC fan, I can only dream of what it could have been.",3,3,6,5 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Little Better Than the First But Still Not Buying Into Captain America
","I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. Hopefully that prevents my review from suffering many unhelpful votes from Marvel fans just because I think Man of Steel and TDK trilogy are more watchable, more interesting, and I felt more involved in those movies.This movie had its moments and to be honest, nothing is really wrong with the movie. It does what Captain America is about. Maybe that is the problem. I agree that this movie is fun, but I don't think it is great. It did seem somewhat predictable and maybe that is why I don't feel this movie is a 9 or 10 like many others.I think Marvel is smart in cashing in on the 'to be continued' type of endings for all the Marvel movies. Like others of the Marvel Universe phases, this had some type of ending after the credits. But to be honest, I had no idea what it was even talking about. Similar to Winter Soldier. If you aren't a die-hard Captain America fan, you just won't feel satisfied as you would with Batman or Superman.In short, the movie is good, not great.",7,0,2,12 April 2014
Man of Steel," The Greatest Comic Book Story - Evolved, Modernized, and Retold
","It is rare that I am able to see a movie on opening night. In fact, I can't remember the last time I did. Anyways, I had this movie marked off the calendar and I will guarantee that this review is the most unbiased and most truthful of any you will ever read for Man of Steel. This is the review of the greatest comic book story ever told by a movie watcher that has no loyalties to either DC or Marvel.First of all, I will say that if you are a fan of Superman in any way, ignore the negative reviews you have heard or read so far and see the movie for yourself. Trust me, you can do a lot worse, and it is hard to find many movies that are much better.The storytelling of Superman assumes the viewer already knows the story. It doesn't treat the viewer as dumb as what I felt some of the recent movies on Marvel's side have done. There are many flashbacks to his early years and it is up to the viewer to put the pieces together as new scenes are shown. Basically, there is a lot of foreshadowing and flashbacks - probably the most I've seen for a movie - even more than the Dark Knight Trilogy. This isn't bad or good. It is different.That is what makes this movie fresh. It is far from a remake and if you are looking for someone to take up Christopher Reeves shoes, look elsewhere. This Superman is updated and slightly darker, but more real. It is just a new story told. And that is where I find the fascination with Superman 1 and 2 so confusing. If one looks at why they were successful, they will see that the first had very little competition (1978) and the second was basically mostly shot when the first was made. This is undisputed. And since both movies were the first blockbusters to tell the Superman story, there was nothing to really compare it to.Man of Steel does has some flaws and I can see where people might complain. Having seen many movies myself, there were set pieces and scenes where I wasn't sure if I was watching War of the Worlds, Independence Day, or Matrix Revolutions. I won't go into details on that but I will say there were some peculiar similarities. Perhaps studios are using the same CGI engines? Overall, this movie is just well written and the cast is nearly perfect. Amy Adams plays a believable Lois Lane and Henry Cavill, IMO, is the most legit looking Superman in any TV show or movie. While Michael Shannon got some laughs by the audience on some overly dramatic scenes, I think he played General Zod as good as anyone could.The huge plus I have for this movie is what they avoided. One of Superman's character flaws is his only 'weakness'. You know what it is and it isn't mentioned anywhere in this movie. I think that is great and gives the possibility for sequels. Secondly, the whole identity thing is a thing of the past. It was never a great trait to the story and this movie franchise seems to have fresh ideas on how to portray Superman. However, you can't get away with the fact that Superman is not Batman and doesn't have the story lines or villains that make Batman so outstanding. Batman's mortality is also what makes him able to relate to everyone.Aside from some minor setbacks, this movie is excellent. My other complaint is that Hans Zimmer's music, while epic, wasn't allowed to be as epic as it could have been. Scenes were cut short and so was the score that played through the movie. I think the editing could have been better to let the music play through scenes.Man of Steel is better than Avengers, Thor, and Captain America, IMO, but not up to the level of any of the Dark Knight Trilogy. Either way I have a feeling it won't get the respect it deserves. All I'm saying is to watch the movie and decide for yourself. 9/10",9,33,60,14 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men Movie Ever By Far. Best Marvel Movie Ever Too!
","Not going to give spoilers, but let's just say this: I haven't watched a movie in theaters like this since TDK trilogy where you were actually hoping the movie wouldn't end and that the story would continue.This movie from beginning to end is top notch in story telling, action, and in keeping to the source material. As a huge fan of the time travel saga from the X-Men cartoons, this movie was just amazing. You get all the characters of that time which include Bishop and his friends.On the other side, you get the past and present characters of the X-Men. You get cameos here and there. Mystique and Wolverine were awesome.For those that want jokes, this movie has them. However, this movie is a lot darker than the Avengers, Captain America, and Thor movies. I would put the 'dark' level in between TDK and Ironman 1.Overall, see this MOVIE NOW! Also stay for the ending. You haven't got goosebumps yet until you see what I saw!!! 10 out of 10! A rare perfect movie. Blows away the other X-Men movies and is the best Marvel movie made yet!",10,1,1,22 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Where is the Plot?
","The new Marvel movies seem to follow a formula these days. It's obvious executives have a chart of what sells and what doesn't. Riskier Marvel movies have not sold as well and the more serious they are it seems the less revenue they generate. So executives basically have forced the studio to use a plot that revolves around elaborate CGI action sequences mixed in with a little dialogue to keep the movie going along.Except... this movie doesn't really have any plot at all. It doesn't really have a conclusion.The movie seems like Avengers on steroids but without the climax. A Civil War with more characters than most fans can even point out at this point. They introduce Black Panther and even bring yet a newer version of Queens, NY's finest. How many renditions will they do on the web crawler? Ironman, Captain America, Black Widow all appear the same and their newness has faded movies ago. Their sidekicks have returned to but are even more forgettable.The villain in this movie is just bad. I don't mean a bad man, I mean just a terrible villain for a movie of this magnitude. Captain America Civil War? Where was the war? Seemed more like an argument and a 10-15 minute battle with a few punches.In my sold out premiere, many people walked out before the after credits scene. I probably should have too. 6/10.",6,7,19,6 May 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not As Good As Days of Future Past, But Still Very Good and Entertaining
","Before I begin, let's just say that if you aren't very familiar with X-Men or at least the 1990s cartoon series, you will not understand much of this movie. To you it will seem like a bunch of CGI, explosions, and random dialogue.However, to the medium to hardcore X-Men fan (not just Marvel fan, but X-Men fan), this movie is the one you've been waiting for. The movie tells the story nicely, but slightly different from the animated series. If you want a background, I suggest you check out the Apocalypse mini-series where Wolverine and Rogue played a much bigger part in fighting Apocalypse.Of the 3 recent X-Men movies, I would say this is tied for the first. DOFP is in a league of its own IMO.My only complaint is that they could have made Apocalypse use more of his powers. But, I do like how they gave his origin in this movie.Overall, the movie is extremely entertaining. I prefer this movie over Avengers 1, 2, and Civil War, but it really depends on whether you can handle violence - which this movie has a lot more of.8/10.",8,9,17,26 May 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," One of the Top 3 Marvel Films to Date - One of 2014's Best Movies By Far
","OK, just got back from opening night. Let me first say that I was hugely disappointed at the audience turnout. I wasn't sure if I was even in the right theater. I did have to wait in a line outside the door before the movie doors opened, but let's talk about this line: 10-15 people. NO! That is no typo. And this wasn't 1 hr+ before the movie started. It was like 15 minutes before. It was mostly nerds and dorks but still, what's the deal? Anyways, let's forget about those that decided to stay at home and miss out on this blockbuster! I will first say that I am a HUGE Zoe Saldana fan. In fact, I would marry her even if she punched me in the face. I can't really tell if I like her as Gamora or Neytiri. Hard to pick! Anyways, this movie will satisfy any Marvel or Sci-Fi fan. The action is definitely there. The visuals are second-to-none (which is saying something given it is 2014 and many movies these days are just CGI by default.The story is simple but it keeps you interested from beginning to end. The casting was excellent. In fact, Batista may have broken the curse of WWE stars being busts in the movie business (cough Cena cough Rock...) There is an after-credit scene but it is nowhere near as epic as X-Men Days of Future Past.Overall, this is definitely the movie to go see this summer if you were going to pick just 1.While I gave X-Men Days of Future Past a 10/10, I'm giving this a 9/10.Solid overall and I predict it will make plenty of money to warrant a solid sequel.",9,0,3,31 July 2014
Jurassic World," Better than 2 and 3, But No Where Near The One That Started It All
","While the average movie goer groups Jurassic Park 1-4 all as dinosaur movies with lots of CGI and elaborate action scenes, I say no.Jurassic Park 1, the legend behind the legend, was a masterpiece. What made it a masterpiece? It wasn't the dinosaurs boys and girls! It was the science. At the time I thought I was watching a documentary. The science made sense. It was explained in great detail. The idea behind the park made sense. Everything went together. The scenes were thought out. The soundtrack was epic.Jurassic Park 2, more of the same that tried to just make money. The beginning of the end of this great franchise.Jurassic Park 3, the worst movie of the 4 by far. The acting was cheesy. The wife of William H Macy's character was the dumbest person in the history of the movies. Just stupid! The movie was stupid. Everything was stupid.This movie. It was better than 2 and 3 but no where near the excitement and awe of the first. That is what you get guys. Chris Pratt did what he could and the other characters played their parts. But the script just wasn't good. It wasn't deep and it wasn't original. It was victims doing stupid things and getting eaten. I mean CGI this CGI that. Can I really be that impressed? 7/10 Good job, good effort, but let this be the last!",7,6,23,15 June 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excellent Movie - A Little Long - A Little Familiar With Other Wall Street Movies
","I will say this right off the bat. 3 hours didn't seem like 3 hours but I could definitely feel it in the last 1 hr of the movie when my body started to get uncomfortable.Leo is Leo and he deserves an Oscar nomination. The plot and everything in the movie is well done just like Scorsese usually does. For those that don't know, this is a Wall Street movie. If you have seen Boiler Room, which was actually inspired by Jordan's story over 10 years ago, or Wall Street, with the original king of Wall Street Gordon Gecko, then some of the movie is predictable. You go from poor to rich and then you get the FBI after you.However, this movie is excellent and tells the story from a slightly different view. People whine about the nudity but let's be serious. It wasn't that bad.Overall, I give this a 9/10. I would have given it an 8/10 but for a 3 hour movie, it definitely does NOT have you falling asleep!",9,1,6,8 January 2014
Arrival," Astronomical! Supernatural! One of the Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Ever!
","I'm at home just minutes after watching the premiere at a sold out theater and there is just one word to describe the movie for me and the audience that stayed in their seats as the credits rolled - stunned. Without revealing spoilers, let's just say this isn't your cookie cutter Marvel Cinematic Universe film, and while it appears to be another 'alien invasion' movie, there really is no movie like this one ever.This movie knocks it out of the park as far as storytelling, soundtrack, acting, special effects, and an ending twist that just leaves you shocked, confused, amazed, stunned, or all of the above.Amy Adams should get nominated for something and the movie script needs to be winning several awards this year.I will say that you need to pay attention during the entire movie and have an open mind in trying to understand what is taking place. This isn't Independence Day where you can go use the restroom and come back and still see Will Smith kicking butt.The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 is because it doesn't quite have the replay value of other movies in this sci-fi/alien invasion category. However, it is still one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time - and I've seen a ton!",9,2,8,10 November 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Fresh Batman, A Fresh Story, Underrated, Misunderstood by Critics
","SPOILERS BELOW - WARNING.I just got out of the theater. It was sold out. People had to sit all the way in the first row in the corner just to get a glimpse of the much-anticipated movie of early Spring 2016. I got my tickets ahead of time, front and center, and was it worth the wait? Yes.As you can see I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10. That doesn't mean it sucks. That doesn't mean it's the best Superman movie ever. It just means it's solid despite critics saying it's the worst Superman movie of all time. I'm going to break down some themes I've heard regarding complaints from this movie and end with quick conclusion and my opinion.1. First, this isn't your Christopher Reeves Superman. If you are still living in the 1970s/1980s, don't bother watching. Comic books movies and specifically Superman and Batman have gone darker and taken on much more mature themes. This movie, IMO, connected great with Man of Steel. It was almost as if this movie was planned all along and links up perfectly with how Man of Steel ended. It gives Batman a purpose and a connection in this Superman/Batman universe.2. Batman. This isn't TDK so don't compare. It's like comparing Curry to Jordan. It's a great version, it just isn't Christopher Nolan/Christian Bale good. Ben Affleck got bulked up for the role so this is by far the biggest Batman ever depicted. It didn't have the wow factor and didn't really show the brains behind Batman like TDK trilogy did, but this movie was already 150 minutes long as it is.3. Wonder Woman. Not talked about much and when her character was fully introduced, it was starting to seem like Spiderman 3 - too many characters, too little time, not enough depth. That is what may be an issue with this movie. Imagine if Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were 1 movie. That would just be torture and make for 1 lousy movie instead of 2 epic movies.4. Lex Luthor. People complaining need to get a grip. It was a fresh version. Not your TV version with the Adventures of Superman and not your Kevin Spacey version of Man of Steel. Something just didn't seem right here and not enough background was done. Was this version super rich? Or super crazy? Or something else? 5. Lois Lane. It's Amy Adams. You either like her or you don't.6. Storyline. If you aren't familiar with the epic 1993 Death of Superman comic book, then don't bother with this movie. You will leave mad and whiny.7. Doomsday. Decent, but again too many characters at this point.Conclusion: 7/10. This movie comes up short to Man of Steel IMO. But it did have it's positives. I have a key issue with how they did Batman during the fight scenes. It was starting to seem too Ironman 2+ like if you know what I mean. Whereas Ironman 1 made the story and the hero much more realistic and TDK trilogy portrayed Batman as someone very vulnerable, they got Batman here doing something else entirely. I really liked Superman. I liked the ending. The pace at times seemed strange and the editing seemed like they had to cut a lot of the movie out during final takes. Definitely see in theaters.",7,3,6,24 March 2016
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A Solid Sequel That is At Least As Good As the First!
","I gave this a 9 out of 10. When the nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes of movie time were up, I was expecting more. It isn't that it ended horribly, it is mostly because I never read the books and this is all new to me. Basically it ended to where the next two movies will be the conclusion.The plot was great but there is some original factor missing because the movie felt similar to the first. It isn't that it is a bad thing but it is more of a Matrix Reloaded than a Terminator 2 as far as original, groundbreaking material if that makes sense.The special effects were extraordinary as usual and the other characters outside the stars were great. Another thing that was missing was that emotional element I guess. While there were some scenes that made you feel for the characters, I think the first Hunger Games made you really care about some of the other contenders.Overall, this movie was a solid 9 and Jennifer Lawrence as usual lives up to expectations. My biggest issue was that when it ended, I didn't think it was over yet if you know what I mean.",9,4,28,21 November 2013
