Mission: Impossible III," As lame as the first two.
","I WAS going to start out saying something like, 'What was Tom Cruise thinking?' But recent publicity has proved that he doesn't. Think, that is. If Mission: Impossible 3 enjoys any sort of financial success at the box office, then I blame the movie-going American public. Cruise and Paramount have turned an intellectually stimulating franchise into a mind-numbing mish-mash of action and violence. A sad commentary on the intellectual level of the average movie fan. Paramount teased those of us who care, by hinting that it would be releasing the television series on DVD, coinciding with the release of M:I3. Instead, Paramount released the first two Cruise installments as a boxed set. Is Paramount hoping to bury any and all memory of the best, the original , television version of Mission: Impossible? Hear me Paramount Studios! I would NOT EVER waste my money buying any Tom Cruise version of Mission: Impossible. I would however, spend BIG BUCKS on buying all seven seasons of the TV series if it were ever released on DVD.",1,0,2,10 May 2006
The Italian Job," More than a re-make!
","MILD SPOILERS. I didn't see the original, so I had nothing to compare it to. I actually saw this film twice at a sneak preview. I liked it so much I had to go back and be thrilled all over again. It is intelligently written and acted. You are actually given clues throughout the movie that tell you what, exactly, will happen. BUT, do you figure it out, or just go with the flow? The first time, I went along for the ride. The second time, the clues just about knocked me in the head like a sledgehammer! I can favorably compare this film to classic episodes of the vintgage television series Mission: Impossible of the 1960's and 1970's. Mark Wahlberg is an intelligent but affable master planner. Edward Norton is made to look like Sean Penn, so he plays out at the perfect sleazeball. Charlize Theron is an ethical, moral, pleasant-looking locksmith/safecracker whose character involvement moves the plot forward without distracting from the flow of events. If you are familiar with the old Mission: Impossible series, look for the similarities, like the choosing of the team, the brief outlining of the plot when all are together, and even the confrontation with the 'bad guy' when he realizes he has been beaten by a superior intellect. Very entertaining and stimulating.",Null,0,0,27 May 2003
Mission: Impossible II," The television show was STILL better (Yeah, I know ... get over it.)
","The television series was better than both M.I. movies. I'm annoyed at Tom Cruise for hi-jacking the title (and musical score) to draw, and perhaps mislead, an unsuspecting audience. Having said that, as a stand-alone movie regardless of title, Mission: Impossible 2 is a major disappointment. The plotting in the first half of the movie is so tedious and convoluted as to make it incomprehensible. The fight scenes at the end of the movie are unfavorably comparable to those found in the children's television show 'The Power Rangers'... remember them? I hope Tom Cruise gets beyond this quickly. He's capable of much better.",Null,0,1,18 November 2001
Mission: Impossible," If you liked the TV series, you will hate this movie!
","If you are a big fan of the television series, starring Peter Graves and Martin Landau, like I am, then you will hate this movie as much as I did. It has nothing to do with the television series, other than its title and opening musical sequence. I went in to this movie expecting more. If you can get beyond these prejudices, then you can expect, at best, a mediocre movie. Right off the top of my head, I can pick five or six episodes from the series that were actually better than this movie. It's a shame because I like Tom Cruse. He's better than this!",1,19,33,27 November 1999
