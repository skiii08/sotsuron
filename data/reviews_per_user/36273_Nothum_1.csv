Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas has grown old
","First of all: I don't know if this IS a spoiler, but I included info on some relevant parts of the movie - because they are the worst part of all. I really don't think this movie CAN be spoiled, for it was already spoiled by Georg Lucas.It's simple: There was almost nothing good to this movie at all: The climax of the first half was a CAR RACE which Anakin Skywalker did not even win by using the Force (an absolute minimum must-be!!!). Liam Neeson is such a bad actor. He gives Qui Gonn the touch of a helpless idiot. I liked Ewan McGregor as Ben, but most of the time (at least to me it seemed) he was sitting around somewhere in the desert. The praised computer animation looks far worse than the model animation on Return of the Jedi. WHY SHOULD ANY ARMY IN THE WORLD USE LIVING BEINGS AS SOLDIERS (Episode 4-6) WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY OF BATTLE DROIDS ALREADY EXISTS (Episode ONE)!? The whole plot lacks one big climax. In A New Hope it was - of course - the final trench run, in The Empire Strikes Back it was the lightsaber duel between Vader and Luke and in Return it was the gigantic battle that actually worked on three locations (space, Endor and within the DS) - and this was what led Lucas to the ABSURD conclusion that only a battle with FOUR locations could top everything. The Landscape: ITALY HAS NEVER LOOKED THAT AWFUL!My summary: Lucas failed to make a movie for the fans and thus made a movie that is worse than the movies because of which we are fans. Making a movie for children is simply not worth a discussion. And unfortunately it was not some young nobody who made this movie and who could be blamed, but Lucas himself.THIS IS NOT ALL what's absolutely bad about Episode1, but it's just not worth the time. Episode 4-6 exist and their flair CANNOT be destroyed even by Lucas himself. Although he is obviously working hard on it!",1,1,3,22 January 2000
