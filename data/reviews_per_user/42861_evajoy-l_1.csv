Ghost," Great film!!!!!!
","I saw this film today, and, it was one of those films that really hit me. After watching it, I found it hard to come back to reality I didn't want it to be over and I just kept thinking about it.The film opens with eerie music....for god's sake, the film is called 'Ghost'. But it's not scary. It does, however, make you think about a few things - life and death, afterlife, and those you love. And how you would feel if an invisible ghost started beating you up.'Ghost' is just brilliant - its more than a romance: it's thought-provoking, hilarious at times (thanks to Whoopi Goldberg), thrilling, mysterious and even sometimes shocking. It's everything! I have to say I didn't know much about Demi Moore before watching this film - and I didn't think much of her either. But now I can see what a talented actress she is. Her performance in this film, as well as that of Patrick Swayze, was heart-rendering.Definitely should watch it - it may not have the biggest, best special effects like we have in the 21st century, but it doesn't need them. FAB!!",9,1,2,11 November 2006
