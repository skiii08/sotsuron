The Blair Witch Project," You've got to be kidding this was terrible
","Can someone please tell me exactly why everyone likes this movie? It was terrible and definitely not deserving of anything more than a 7!  I, and my whole family, which ranges from 38 to 15, thought this movie was worse than The Haunting.  First of all, the camera was difficult to follow. After a while, I almost got motion sickness.  Secondly, what was scary about that movie?  Piles of rocks, stick figures, and messed up tents. Oh My!  Lastly, is it some trend or something?  Are we just having movies with bad writers lately?  I mean, where was the ending? If you know, please point it out. Overall, this movie is terrible. It's over rated, and definitely not worth 5.75 let alone 3.75! Just wait for it to come on cable to be utterly unfulfilled!",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't believe the critics this movie is great.
","Well I just saw the movie so it's fresh on my mind and I must say I was a bit skeptical  because of the reviews but it was amazing.  The movie was great with the special fx, the music, the fighting scenes, and even little Jake Lloyd was good.  All in all I say it's a great prequal and everything you'd expect from George Lucas.",9,0,0,19 May 1999
