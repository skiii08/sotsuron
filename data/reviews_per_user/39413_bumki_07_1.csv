The King's Speech," I think this is really good
","Well, I haven't seen this movie yet but I think this will be a great movie and am looking forward to watching this movie in Korea!Furthermore I think this movie is very precise and touching. THe lessons are very impressive and I thought the breakthrough that King makes will be extraordinary one. THe fact that he is first reluctant but changes his attitude and becoming very zealous will be indeed very very great. In general, I cannot hide my feeling that the movie is super-dupa. In addition, I would like to recommend this movie to all the lost people who are spending their time lazily, just like me at the moment. Therefore, I think this movie is very splendid.",10,0,0,20 March 2011
