First Man," First man on the moon or HAL 9000?
","You are told that you are going to be the first human being on the moon - in a toilet??? Shhh, no one's looking, would you like some heroin with that?(the scene reminiscent of Viper telling Maverick Goose is dead, but it made sense there, it doesn't make sense here.)I had way more fun and was way more excited watching documentaries about moon landing than this movie. If you are young and don't know much about space program in the 60's, skip this boring, depressing movie and watch documentaries about this glorious achievement!Oh, and Neil Armstrong was a warm human being who was able to smile and enjoy his work and his life, not a robot!Buzz: Open the pod bay doors, Neil.
Neil: I'm sorry, Buzz. I'm afraid I can't do that.Oh, I am sorry - I confused the First Man with HAL 9000.",1,27,43,16 December 2018
Bird Box," A blind rip off
","This movie has taken ideas from other movies, but sadly it completely fails.
'The Mist' - a group of survivors must remain in the enclosed space because 'something is in the mist!' (What a great line and a great movie!). They barricade themselves, but must go for a supply run. Includes a religious person as well.
'World War Z' - sudden outbreak and the mayhem on the street (loved it in both movies).
'I am Legend' - a radio communication is established with a survivor compound. You just need to go there.
'Walking Dead' - bad guys survivors fight good guys survivors. Also, endless fillers with every character's sob story about their late fathers or something of that sort.Now, what's worst than a rip off is that Bird Box simply doesn't deliver. No answers, no explanations, no ending, no sense, no logic. Generous 3 stars, mostly based on cinematography.",3,1,3,23 March 2019
Dunkirk," Super boring
","What a disappointment! I went to the theatre with an expectation of seeing a spectacle in the class of Saving Private Ryan (SPR), but boy, was I in for a rude awakening! So, what is Dunkirk (2017)? It's a movie similar to SPR, but rid of ANY story and ANY character development. It's like a war documentary, but without any narration. We see the soldiers, the airplanes, torpedoes, ships, but there's no story that connects them and pulls you in. When I saw SPR, I was engrossed in the story immediately. Here, I walked out after about 30 min because the movie failed to engage me in any way.No matter what genre I watch, I am ticked off by unrealistic scenes (given the premise, of course. It is not unbelievable to watch Spiderman walk on the ceiling because you accept that the movie works on the premise that Peter Parker got bit by a radioactive spider and thus developed some spider-like abilities. However, it would tick me off if Spiderman's hand turned into a rocket launcher or a plasma weapon - that's the premise for Terminator movies, not for Spiderman.) But I digress. So, the main character sees another soldier on the beach. He approaches him and says nothing. O-Kay.... He keeps looking at him, and the other soldier, also without saying anything, gives him water. The main character drinks, returns the bottle and leaves without a word. Ummm... A 'Thank you, man' would be in order. You would think they have some telepathic abilities and are able to communicate with thoughts. But OK - I am thinking everybody's super stressed, so I let it go. But the next scene is what really kills me - enemy planes bomb the beach full of soldiers. After the planes flew away, the surviving soldiers get up from the ground. Some remain on the ground, presumably dead or wounded. Nobody approaches the soldiers on the ground to check if they're wounded, if somebody is still alive and needs help! Absolutely unrealistic! They looked like robots, not soldiers who cared about their fellow brothers in arms.The movie goes on skipping from story to story, all of them being boring and not connected to one other. No dialog, no character development, no story! Silent movies provide more dialog than this! Just when I thought our main character was mute and deaf, he finally opened his mouth some 25 min into the movie. At the moment when a torpedo hit the ship, I didn't see the soldiers who I connected with, struggling to survive - I saw actors dressed in uniforms shooting a movie. That's the moment when I got up and left -- while the actors were still acting they were under water hit by a torpedo...",1,33,60,7 August 2017
