Walk the Line," Bravo!
","Bravo! The last movie I saw where people in the theater stood up and applauded at the end was the original Star Wars - until today! Strangers, young and old alike were talking to each other in the parking lot after wards about how GREAT this film is! Having grown up in Texas and thoroughly familiar with Johnny Cash and June Carter's music, I was AMAZED with Phoenix's and Witherspoon's performance. This is one of those rare films that while watching it you have to remind yourself to breathe. At one point I managed to nudge my husband and whisper, 'You are looking at a great piece of art.' I don't 'gush' about anything, but I'm gushing about this movie. We saw it on Thanksgiving Day, and what a wonderful gift it is! Thank you ALL who helped to create it.Sincerely, Elizabeth Vining",10,0,3,24 November 2005
