Sucker Punch," A film that succeeds despite its problems
","I don't usually add reviews to films on IMDb, but I felt I'd make an exception on Sucker Punch because it's such a confounding film. Before watching Sucker Punch I had read a number of reviews-- most of them poor-- detailing the film's standard reviewers' bullet-point failures. Most of the film's problems in these areas are legitimate and should be discussed, especially for those coming into the film looking for traditional film elements.Character development is very thin. Zack Snyder never shows to us what the motivations of the movie's primary protagonist (Emily Browning) and her four companions really are. Aside from the heavily stylized introduction of Baby Doll (Browning) no background is ever revealed about how or why they came to the asylum which will leave many viewers frustrated, and might make it difficult to connect with the characters. There are odd plot points and tangential characters which the movie suggests have some deeper meaning or connection to the story but whose reason for existence is never fully revealed. One also gets the impression that scenes may have been cut or pared down for brevity, which may have left some of these plot points lopped off or unexplored.Having said that, this movie is a powerhouse of anime-comic book style brought to film. And despite the lack of character and plot background, the acting and performances are actually very good, and in some cases quite powerful. Oscar Isaac's performance of the Orderly/Pimp is powerful and effective leaving a mark on the viewer's psyche. Carla Gugino's enigmatic role as the doctor/madame is convincing and beautiful. In some ways, Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone almost unwittingly capture the movie with their performance as sisters who help the protagonist Browning's Baby Doll hatch her escape plan from the asylum.Finally, there's the visuals. The movie is so utterly successful at this, drawing in elements from Japanese Anime, steampunk and comic book styling, fantastic makeup and costume design coupled with a heart-pounding soundtrack made up of classic rock covers done in heavy electronic style, that it simply overwhelms any plot or character shortcomings of the film.For any comic book/anime/steampunk fans, this film is a must see. I dispute some of what other reviewers have written, specifically in the realm of character performances. The acting is actually quite good, even excellent in the case of Isaac's performance of Blue. For fans of the genre, this is a DVD that you will want to purchase for your collection.",Null,0,0,22 August 2011
