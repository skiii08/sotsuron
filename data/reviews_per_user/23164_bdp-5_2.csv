Casablanca," i love this film
","they do not make 'em like this anymore. this script should be enshrined somewhere for future civilizations to find and judge us on. the film has everything you could possibly want. and do yourself a favor; after watching 'casablanca,' check out 'top secret' to see how REALLY funny that film is!<ul><li>bdp</li></ul>",Null,0,0,4 February 1999
LÃ©on: The Professional," terrific film
","blew me away. great from start to finish. great plot, smooth flow overall, terrific script, great action scenes, great performances from danny aiello, natalie portman, and jean reno. even the otherwise completely-out-of-touch-with-reality gary oldman is watchable here. rent it soon.-bdp",10,0,1,4 February 1999
