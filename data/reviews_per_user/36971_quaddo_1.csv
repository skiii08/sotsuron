Lucky Number Slevin," Rendez-Vous
","Warning! Spoilers inside!Hmm. Haven't I seen this movie before? Yes. I have. Take one third 'Yojimbo'(1961) (or 'A Fistful of Dollars'(1964) and 'Last Man Standing'(1996)). One third 'Leon' and finally one third of your average straight-to-video-revenge-flick. Voila: LNS. The twist at the end appears too early (if you hadn't already figured it out). Yawn. With about 25 minutes to go, this really drags on.... Poor casting: Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu anyone (?), also drags this movie into some kind of tripe. Bruce Willis is OK, but then again he basically did the same role in 'Last Man Standing'. Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman are both auto-pilot-mode. My rating: 4 out of 10.",2,1,4,21 April 2007
