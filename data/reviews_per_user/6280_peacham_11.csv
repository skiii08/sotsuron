The Blair Witch Project," Waste of time
",Never before have I seen such a sorry excuse for a horror film. Original? Yes. Scary? No. Well acted? No. The last 10 minutes of this movie were well done but the build up to it was dull and amatuerish. Add libbing a script is no substitute for writing dialouge. This was an experiment that failed.For a great Horror film check out Haunted starring kate beckensale and John Gielgud.,1,0,1,18 October 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Chilling , Humorous and Well Paced.
","Sleepy Hollow offered very few disappointments. The Direction was slick, the mood intense, and the performances for the most part,consistently good. Johnny Depp owes the development of his career to Burton,each film he has done for the director has revealed a finely tuned performance. his comic timing as Icabod Crane is well polished. Christina Ricci fares less well as Katrina. the role is a thankless one and she never really tries to act it. Delightful support is provided by the wonderful 4 town elders played to perfection by Ian McDiarmid (Star Wars evil Senator/Emperor Palpatine),Michael Gambon,Jeffrey Jones(Amadeus's Emperor Joseph),and Michael Gough (of Hammer film fame). I would have liked to see these men have more screen time but it was worth losing more of them to Christopher Lee's great pre-credits cameo. Christopher Walken and Miranda Richardson also provide fine support as the Horseman and the haughty Lady Van Tassell respectively. This is by no means Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow, it is Tim Burton's child and shows all the traits of its brilliant parent. do not try to compare the two they are seperate stories altogether. Both are well worth the visit.",7,0,0,29 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Good Star Wars film,Adequate Conclusion.
","While by far and away the weakest film in the first trilogy it has some things going for it. The opening scenes with Jabba the Hutt were very well played.The scenes are intense and gripping,Michael Carter's cameo as Bib Fortuna is a delight,and sorry anyone not pleased by the site of Carrie Fisher in the Slave costume must be embalmed. Its not the only reason to watch Fisher though, her performance in those scenes is very ,very, good. its a shame that she,along with Harrison Ford are barely utilized for the remainder of the film ! Ian McDiarmid is a joy to watch as Palpatine, this expert actor from London's Almedia Theatre is one of the finest additions to the Star Wars universe. ( as good as he is here he is even better in  Phantom Menace). With all the good things happening in the first two films though it seems that Lucas needed not a trilogy but a 4 part series, part 3 should have delt with Han's rescue and Luke completing his training. pt. 4 should have been the downfall of the Empire and Anakin's redemption.still its by no means a bad film but more,how should I say, a quick and enjoyable wrap up. Oh, Well its highly watchable but not near as well done as the first two films.",7,0,1,29 October 1999
Bridget Jones's Diary," Highly Enjoyable
","To begin with,I have not yet read the book that this film was based on so my opinions are based only on the film itself.On the plus side I found the film to be quite well cast. Renee Zellweger is outstanding as Bridget. She perfect adapts a British dialouge and fall so deeply into the role that You forget she is an american.She is perky,caustic,cynical and quite fetching. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are priceless as the objects of her affections. Grant finally gets another chance to stretch his acting muscles as a vapid womanize who prove quite unloveable...and Firth finally gets another big screen role to equal 'Valmont' or his stage performaces.He develops his character slowly and deeply throughout the film. Special attention must be given to the wonderful Jim Broadbent as Bridget's Dad.Although not on screen for any length of time,It is another well drawn character in his ever growing list of great portrayals. On the down side I can only state the under developed nature of some of the supporting roles,I would have liked to see more of Bridget's friends,Mother and family.",8,1,1,21 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Amazingly Filmed,Splendidly Acted.
","There is not alot that I can add that has not already been said. Peter Jackson's film adaptation of 'Fellowship Of The Ring' is an astounding cinematic experience. I will point out a few of the high points of this wonderful film. The casting is perfect. Sir Ian McKellen's enigmatic performance as Gandalf leads the accolades. appropiately wise,humorous,stoic and above all..real!Christopher Lee is utterly chilling as the fallen wizard Saruman.Although on screen less than McKellen this veteran actor holds his own in their scenes together and leaves you wanting more (which we will indeed get in 'Two Towers'.) Sir Ian Holm gives us a very 'human' Bilbo Baggins. his is the most touching performance in the film, and Sean Astin captures Samwise's personality from his first appearance on screen. The location shooting,special effects and cinematography are some of the finest ever put on film and at nealry three hours I still wanted to see more. Many people have complained about some minor changes from the book.I for one felt the changes were perfectly acceptable for a screen adaptation. The written word and a motion piture are 2 different mediums and you cannot film a novel verbatim and hold an audiences interest. Film is a visual medium and must be approached as such. Hre is looking forward to Part II!",10,0,0,20 December 2001
In the Name of the Father," Political Nonsense.
","True it was a well made film with strong performances from Postelwaite and Lewis, however the one sided story favoring the Irish was nothing more than a film makers political agenda. I am sick and tired of films making Great Britain out to be the villians and the Irish holier than thou martyrs.Just once I would like to see England defended in one of these big budget films.No one country is innocent.The obvious Irish sympathies in this film make it unwatchable.Not once is England portrayed in this film as anything but a stock villian! Wake up people this film is nothing but Irish propaganda.",1,21,76,23 December 1999
Spider-Man," Strong Acting Strengthens Film.
","While rather light on plot,the acting talent in 'Spider Man' elevated it from the average into a highly enjoyable film with many emotional moments. With a cast as talented as Toby McGuire,Rosemary Harris,Cliff Robertson,Williem Dafoe,Kirsten Dunst and J.K.Simmons and a screenplay that was not afraid to be touching,'Spiderman' becomes more than just a superhero film.The relationship between Peter and his Aunt and Uncle are especially well developed. Tony winner Harris and Oscar winner Robertson were the perfect pair to bring Aunt May and Uncle Ben to life.Dafoe gives us a villian that is so much more tormented than the standard scenery chewing maniac,and Dunst gets to show us the honest acting talent that we have known her capable of when given a well written script. While others have comented on the special effects and the action sequences,this is not what I left the theatre thinking of.I came away thinking of the bonds between family and the struggle to keep going in a changing world.",8,0,0,6 May 2002
The Exorcist," Masterpiece of Horror
","For sheer emotional and mental terror,'The Exorcist' stands alone as the single most frightening film ever made.Nearly 30 years after its premiere it still never fails to deliver.The screenplay and direction are one of the films major strengths,Friedkin knows how to build tension,he also knows how to develop realistic characters.The late, great playwright Jason Miller turns in the finest performance of the film (and of his career as an actor) as the doubting and troubled Father Karras. Miller shows us a very human and struggling priest,full of the desire to believe yet held back by his own inner demons. He was appropriately honored with an Oscar nod for this performance. Also strong is Max Von Sydow as the Un-nerving and Staunch Father Merrin,while Lee J. Cobb provides steadying support as Detective Kinderman. Without spoiling the plot and outcome,Von Sydow and Miller provide an intense climax to the film during the exorcisim scenes, each one performance intensely showing what they are willing to give to free Regan from the possession. Overall an incredible film that has not dated or aged with the years.",8,1,2,6 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Worthy Second Installment!
","Two down and One to go...and so far Jackson's adaptation of the Ring trilogy shows no signs of diminishment. I won't go into heavy plot detail since others have covered it here quite well,but I did want to point out some high points. First off the film is smooth...it moves quite well with no lulls in plot,action or characterization. Some outstanding new performances come from Miranda Otto as Eowyn,Brad Douriff as the creeepy Grima Wormtounge and especially Bernard Hill as the conflicted King Theodin.Hill is by far one of the most welcome additions to the cast...always showing you a real human being beneath the crown.Hill's most moving moment is his 'So it Begins' speech about the futility of war. Returning actors Sir Ian McKellen,Sean Astin,Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee continue in their finely tuned portrayals and Orlando Blooms Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli are at last given more to do. Their relationship is well presented. The way Jackson presented the voice over speeches by Galadriel and Elrond was quite effective,and Blanchett sand Weaving use their wonderfully emotional speaking voices well.  Here is looking forward to Return Of The King with great anticipation!",10,0,0,26 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Exciting and Innovative!
","Moulin Rouge is a spectacular piece of entertainment. Its fun,visually stunning and totally engrossing. I was a bit leary considering the fact that director Bar Luhurmann was responsible from the assinine 'Romeo and Juliet' adaptation several years ago.But my fears were put to rest with this charming film. The true star is Catherine Martin's awe inspiring design work. No film has ever looked so visually beautiful.The performances,of course, are nothing to sneeze at...the fetching Nicole Kidman is sheer delight as Satine and posseses a singing voice that was quiete appealing.She turns in a sexy and stunning performance. Ewan McGregor is equally fine as the poet, Christian. Jim Broadbent steals every scene he is in as the Moulin Rouge's boisterous owner and M.C.,Harold Zidler.Broadbent is one of today's finest actor's and here he pulls out all the stops. I will say that I am not a fan of some of the music used in the film,(Roxanne,and Zidler's first song)however as reinterpreted by these fine actors, they are quite enjoyable. Luhrmann deserves applause for this fine achievement in cinema.",10,1,2,26 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," not just a film, an inspiration
","What can I say about this film that has not been said before? nothing. it is such a well done production . it takes us back to the days of arthur and merlyn but also ahead to a fantastic world never captured in film,book or imagination before. The cast fits the characters so well, Peter Cushing was never more chilling than as the Evil Grand Moff Tarkin. with his menacing glances and his Bull dog, Vader he keeps the outer rim sector in his tight grasp.Harrison Ford gave us an anti hero a la bogart and created an icon for young boys everywhere. Alec Guiness . like the force, binds the film together, emotionally and in terms of the plot. a great actor in a great role. Carrie Fisher gave the girls someone to look up to, a pretty but gutsy heroine quite capable of handling herself ( and a blaster!) its impossible to sum up in this paragraph the films allure, mystque and staying power ,so lets just sit back relax and let Mr. Lucas take us back along time ago to a galaxy far, far, away....",10,0,0,11 October 1999
