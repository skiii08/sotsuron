The Ring," I don't scare easily
","The Ring disturbed me.I have never been 'scared' by a movie but every now and then one comes along and gets close, The original 'Cape fear' was one, Fail Safe another. It touches on aspects of psychology and the perception of reality in just the right way. Tho the leads ex hubby is a bit stupid about the distorted photos. I would have started worrying big time after super mart camera scene. The whole distorted photo line is damn excellent. it gave me a shiver. As Brando said...'The horror'And i too was caught flatfooted with sons comment on Samara. The turn around. Not a victim but a thing of evil. Well doneThe ring stands alone for me as an example of how to make a scary movie. Fail Safe was another. But that's my generation.The fly on the screen... simply wonderful concepts...8/10",8,3,4,20 May 2010
Watchmen," Core originality
","Simply said. I can find nothing about watchmen to bitch about. It took me through a world view and left me wanting more.The parallel world of watchmen where Nixon is a defacto Hitler.. is right out of fallout3 game and we all need a mod cons bunker. If you have no imagination or desire to know history. don't watch this.In its way a revelation. I am asked to produce 10 lines of text.. so i will expand. The movie does not need 10 lines . Like 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.It is a work of art as a whole. A story worth telling. So few movies like this exist.We argue to and fro about aspects of this or that film. But movies like watchmen, Mockingbird, Phenomenon, are art.'I am not locked in here with you, you are locked in here with me'Now THAT will become a catch aphorism for all the wannabee heroes. Rorschach became real to me with that line. His vigilante stance is now backed by raw power even if his stance leads to destruction he has earned it in willingness to fight any odds. A nice sub text to NUKE war and 'where are we now' all missiles forgiven global warming the enemy.Mommy.. whats a 'red' and why are they under my bed?",8,2,7,20 May 2010
Centurion," sad
","Lets be honest. Production, not bad but it's all fiction. So we get this Brit eyed view of history as it was not. The accents are enough to make any thinking historian laugh out loud I was expecting .. gotta fiver ? There is in fact very little history at all in this film. At least in Gladiator those roman Legions 'leggio' DID fight at those places like Teutoburg forrest An ongoing project by a fading empire to convince us that Britain DEFEATED ROME. The servants of dour england just WISH they had a Thermopylae. They did not. Not even close. Rome left. it was not driven out. It left for same reason so many brits have left. To get away from drizzle and bad food. The British empire was not about conquest, it was about escape.Like Iraq.. history is made by any damn fool who speaks first A British righthand job",Null,1,5,15 December 2010
