Hereditary," Watch this movie!
","I've been waiting to watch a good horror film for quite a long time. Like many of you, I too became tired of the innumerable copy-paste horror flicks filled with jump-scare elements and easy to guess plots, and was looking for a piece which would give me the taste of old classics. I wouldn't say I was completely satisfied (this is not an Exorcist), but it's the closest it could get in a very long time, I think. The movie starts like a normal drama and builds suspense for a long time, not neglecting to release the tension intermittently, but the last half an hour or so is like a roller-coaster. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's a masterpiece, but fans of the genre: Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.",8,2,4,24 June 2018
Last Flag Flying," It hurts to see a good idea being executed poorly
","I agree with one of the commentators here: I think the movie originated from a great idea but it was executed poorly. More than three decades later, three Vietnam veterans get together again after the son of one of them dies on duty in Iraq. All three men have different personalities and add their own flavor to the plot and this is all good, but a lack of seriousness disturbs you throughout most of the movie. It's nice to see Steve Carrell out of comedy movies, but his character seems too relaxed for a father who just recently lost his son. Bryan Cranston is shining in his portrayal of the care-free, live today think tomorrow type character, and I felt like Laurence Fishburne could do a lot better if his character was written with more attention.",6,0,0,20 July 2018
Mother!," 'I'll just get started on the apocalypse!'
","I've had a keen interest on Aronofsky's work since 'Pi', and this is one of those movies where his obsessive biblical/occult interests resurface again. The movie left me baffled since it made me admire the metaphors on the one end, yet the overly explicit nature of those metaphors ruins most of the fun. The acting is quite dull (except for Michelle Pfeiffer), and most of the visual effects are simply meager for a movie of this caliber. Still, the movie manages to make you think once it's finished.And do I really buy environmentalist interpretation? I don't think so :)",Null,0,0,27 June 2018
