Casablanca," The best romance ever filmed
","I do not remember the number of times I have watched this film, but it is always the very best every time I see it. It is so much better than Romeo and Juliet. This is a grown-up movie. I never tire of it and the actors. Probably comparable to Enchantment and Tomorrow is Forever. Thank you. Florence Forrester-Stockton florriebbc@aol.com",10,0,0,9 January 2002
