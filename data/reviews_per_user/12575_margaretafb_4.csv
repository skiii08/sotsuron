Requiem for a Dream," A warning for all illusion lovers!
","I watched 'Requiem for a dream' at the end of last year just because I had seen Jared Leto's name in the cast and the movie is a drama. So, at first I didn't expect it will be such a powerful and impressing movie. I was passing through a bad period of my life, I had a different kind of addiction ( not drugs or things like that, I was addicted to a person and this is as well a very dangerous addiction). Of course that when you build your dreams on fictive bases nothing works at last and you'll find yourself drowning in despair. I had the chance to taste a bit of this failure, of course that not in such a tragical way as this movies's main characters did. I think it will remain one of those few movies that I will never forget till I die. Marion and Harry, two young people with dreams and hopes for the future lose almost everything for the sake of drugs. Their addiction transforms them into shells void of purpose. But what impressed me the most was that even drowned in misery, their love to each other was the only thing that kept them alive, the only thing that humanized them. I mean, from all other points of view they became only some lame animals controlled by their instinct of getting drugs, but love saved their souls somehow, if this was possible.After all I don't think the message of the movie is the common: 'DON'T DO DRUGS!'. No! It's way more than that. 'Requiem for a dream' represents a real warning for all illusion lovers, for all the people who avoid the real world to flee into a feigned one!",10,0,1,1 July 2012
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best teen dramas
","This movie impressed me in a way that I didn't really expect. Unfortunately I haven't read the book but I want to do it as soon as possible. From the first moments when Charlie started to write his letter I felt a strong empathy for him. I recognized myself in his way of seeing life, his fear of the others...and of the whole world actually. He made me remember my own fears from the time when I entered high school. I'm also a 'wallflower'. I'm the one who always keeps quiet, observes and understands facts. Logan Lerman's character made this movie so worth watching for me. I found myself even in his mental illness too, because, after all, it is a symbol of the 'ghosts' which haunt each of us, the drama that lies behind our appearance. I think every teenager in this world should see this movie! It presents all the forms of anguish, anxiety, queerness and peculiarity that take over us. This story was made to show us that we're not alone! and that we're not some creepy aliens!I'm only 19 but at the end of the movie I felt so very old! It made me want to stop the time and remain there...at that moment when Charlie had finally touched the apogee of this adventure called adolescence!",10,9,13,29 December 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," Fifty shades of Greyish
","Like at least half of the couples from the entire planet, I and my boyfriend went to watch the contradictory 'Fifty shades of Grey'.I decided to go there with an open mind as I had read both positive and negative reviews. I didn't have great expectations and I used to joke by saying to people that I was just curious how it feels to watch porn in a full cinema hall. The truth is I really wanted to see if the book and film do have substance or an underlying message, a sort of philosophy or at least a coherent story. It all started nice, very usual, with the two meeting, the flickers in the protagonists' eyes, Anastasia's shyness and Grey's boldness. The first part was entertaining - if we try to leave aside the boring clichés- because of some cute and funny moments that got people giggling.But as the film advanced, the cute funny moments vanished and the clichés started to pile up to build a weird and sick story that can hardly be called a story. Mr Grey, one of the most wanted men on the planet, falls in love with the cute little student, Anastasia, who is, accidentally, a virgin. Seriously? Of course it was that kind of romantic 'love at first sight', and Anastasia couldn't stop thinking about him and he always shows up when she's least expecting it. Oh, come on! These people really got on my nerves. It's clear that Grey wants the girl because she's the 'rare bird' and he's used to get everything he wants. All he does throughout the film is psychologically pressing Anastasia to surrender to his will and so be his sexual slave. And there's also Anastasia who knows that if she doesn't agree to 'play' with him, they won't ever see each other. So, we have a guy who is sentimentally blackmailing a girl to be able to put into practice his sick sexual perversities.I really regret having watched this on 'Valentine's Day'. I've searched for love in here. I have. And I have only found a maimed specimen of it. But thinking better about it, I realize that maybe this is what 'love' means in this century: sex&money&perversities.There were also a lot of scenes that I've found creepily hilarious such as the one in which Anastasia is spanked by Grey. Also, the explanation of Grey's behaviour - that is his tormented childhood and adolescence- felt very unnatural, very clichéd. He struggles to look charming and mysterious but I don't buy it! I don't believe him! And he didn't make me care about him. I went to watch this because I was curious. I don't regret doing it (except that, as I said before, it had to happen on Valentine's day). Anyway, while I heard some people went out of the cinema hall ready to spicy up their intimate lives, I felt the opposite effect on me: disgust for sex ( when is implies disrespect and blackmail).",4,4,11,14 February 2015
The Truman Show," Fake smiles or real tears
","Far from being a masterpiece, this film has something special to offer to the viewers. It's really enjoyable, fun and smart. Besides subtly criticizing the media and it's ways of manipulation this film was a true lesson to me. It made me think about the importance of living, knowing and discovering. Some of us fear change and can't easily get out of their comfort zone. I think it's a big deal to have the courage to leave your home, that place that made you who you are to face the world and get to know yourself better. The human mind is a very complex 'toy' but also fragile. Sometimes we prefer living a lie because it gives us sort of a sense of security, sometimes we reject new experiences just because they are...new, sometimes we like to live in our own little universe for fear of the others. This film has many morals and it's up to each of us to discover one. For me, the moral was: It's never too late to escape from the perfect little world you've created or the others have created for you and start to LIVE for REAL!",9,0,1,17 September 2013
