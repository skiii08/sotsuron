The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," If you know to expect a 'Part 1' you won't be disappointed
","I went to this movie knowing that it will be a filler movie. This Part 1 thing wasn't a problem for me. I was expecting a good set-up movie for the Part 2 and that's what I got. It had emotion and humor mixed well. The story however is slow, probably too slow for some, but the great performances save the day. Jennifer Lawrence, Philip Seymour Hoffman are especially good. Not to forget other cast members.The movie also gave some wonderful moments. Partly thanks to the great soundtrack by James Newton Howard. I noticed some parts of the soundtrack to be the same from the first film and it was great that they used some of the same music because the first Hunger Games film's soundtrack was amazing.The movie will need the second part however and I am looking forward to it. The part 2 will surely make this one look better on some viewer's eyes as well.Concerning the source material. To those who have read the books: I think this movie stays more true to the source material than the earlier ones. Even more than Catching Fire. So in that sense this is my favorite movie of the series. In the sense of a stand alone movie, not so much.If you liked the first movies you will surely like this one as well. If you didn't like the first ones, well you were probably going to pass on this one anyway so I don't need to tell you to do that.BUT if you are a new viewer to Hunger Games as a whole, watch the first two first or this will confuse you very much.",8,4,21,4 December 2014
Black Swan," Amazing film
","Black Swan was a chilling film. Natalie Portman gives an amazing performance as a young ballerina named Nina. She is given the desired role of Swan Queen in the Swan Lake ballet. However she starts to lose her mind under the pressure of the playing the part. The film gives us an behind the scenes look to the life of a ballerina. And from what I've heard about ballerinas, the film is fairly accurate. The rivalries between the dancers are bitter and the pressure is really hard when competing for the best roles.Black Swan is well directed and edited, with a good score. As Nina descends more into madness and starts having hallucinations I felt like I was watching a horror film. I thank director Aronofsky for his kind direction and warning us about jump scares in advance. Beyond the jump scares the film was a terrifying experience. Nina's whole story arc is a nail biting experience.The film's whole story acts as an allegory for the Swan Lake ballet, where likewise in the film the main protagonist descends into the darkness of her own mind. The foreshadowing isn't very subtle, but the film stays suspenseful and intensive till the end. Black Swan is definitely one of the best films of 2010.",9,2,4,23 January 2015
Zodiac," True stories are not always good on film
","Yeah so the film is about the mass murderer called the Zodiac Killer and the manhunt for him. He kills innocent people and the authorities are trying to find him of course. The film is a true story. It follows closely the real events and the characters are real as well.That's one of the main problems with it. The film is far too long and slow. There is not much excitement apart from couple of scenes. But in those scenes you already know the outcome because this is true story. That's the problem with films following true stories very closely and not embellishing the story to fit it better in a film. I wasn't keen on the cinematography neither. The film is about a dark topic but that doesn't really reflect from the film. The setting is always bright and almost happy even.When watching this film it didn't feel like I was watching a feature film, but more like a documentary. Because honestly this is how it feels. And who would be interested in watching a documentary that runs 2 hours and 45 minutes. As sometimes in the film, the characters lose faith in finding the Zodiac Killer, I myself lost faith in having interest in the movie.So the film was too long and dull, but there was some quality acting. Performances were good all around and there is nothing bad to say about Fincher's directing. So the film wasn't bad but it wasn't great neither. Something between.",7,0,0,10 December 2014
Southpaw," Yes and no
","Southpaw reminds me of Fury. That's because, both movies tell stories that have already been told before. I have more or less seen Southpaw even before watching it, just with different cast and directors.I don't have anything against that by default. IMO same or similar stories to each other can be told as many times as long as they entertain the viewer again. For example, Fury was very generic and clichéd, but it had some good moments of it's own and it kept me entertained.Southpaw was generic and clichéd as well, but the truly great moments lacked.The feels the movie tried to push at me felt far too artificial. When the protagonist Billy Hope's wife Maureen died, it was too soon and it didn't have an impact on me. It was so artificial, cause obviously I will feel sorry for the guy, because his wife died, but solely because she was his wife. The movie didn't make me feel anything in regards of her character. I barely even got to know her.Billy's progress through the movie was too superficial and didn't make me feel anything below the surface. That's why the ending felt stale, even though it should have been a happy moment.So story wise the movie is a big no no. But the acting from Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing. For what it's worth his performance made me watch the movie till the end. Rachel McAdams was lacking and she wasn't even in the movie for that long. Forest Whitaker wasn't even close to what he was in The Last King of Scotland, but he was still fine. And Naomie Harris surprised me! She was great in a small role.The score did get on my nerves sometimes, the piano was nice, but the string instruments went too far at times. Music was used quite copiously even when dialogue was going on, or at least it felt like it. I wasn't a fan of that.So a plus for the acting and a minus for the rest of the movie.",5,1,1,5 October 2015
Blood Diamond," This is Africa
","I watched Traffic the night before I watched Blood Diamond and I can't help to notice the similarity. Both movies have a substance, that makes money for some and makes others suffer for it. In Blood Diamond's case it's, surprise surprise, diamonds. Blood Diamond is more of a popcorn flick movie than Traffic was, but Blood Diamond doesn't lack any of the emotion or depth. Actually I think Blood Diamond had much more emotion than Traffic. Blood Diamond is a great film with good, but at times too convenient, story for my taste. The movie's story is fiction but some of the events happening are/have been real. There is a great mix of fiction and true story blended in.Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing in the leading role as a smuggler who beneath the rough exterior has a deeper side. Djimon Hounsou is good as well. Both of them were nominated for an Oscar I saw. Jennifer Connelly wasn't too shabby neither.Real deal however is the beauty of Africa. The film was really filmed in Africa and the result is wonderful. The movie almost feels like a tourist tour to Africa's nature. Also, I have been very pleased with James Newton Howard's scores. Most recently in The Hunger Games series. And this score was once again nothing more than amazing.",8,1,1,8 December 2014
Sicario," Loved it
","I can't be bothered to write detailed long reviews anymore (not in English at least, it's not my first language) since I don't have the time and or interest in writing them. But I like to blurt out stuff so here we go.I had waited for the movie a long time and it didn't disappoint. I liked pretty much everything in the movie. The acting, the direction, the suspense, the score, the visuals. The plot was not as amazing as the rest of the movie, but it was good.Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro were both amazing in the movie. Josh Brolin was good as well. I don't like Jon Bernthal, but he played a role that really suited him and he was surprisingly good.Directing and cinematography were great. The movie had a lot of great visuals. Sometimes it felt like I was watching a documentary about Mexican/Texan landscape, but I didn't mind that. It was great. It was something different. The direction really mixed well with the score. The score goes up and down and creates great tension and suspense.I'm gonna say that this is my favorite movie of the year.I have never seen a movie by Denis Villeneuve before. I will most likely check out his previous work.",10,2,5,1 October 2015
Lucy," I just can't
","I really don't know what to say about this movie. I just know that I didn't like it. The story sure is something different than you would expect from an action movie. But a different or a daring story doesn't automatically equal a good story. And in my opinion the story in Lucy is completely ridiculous. Weird story, with below average action and terrible characters equals a bad movie.I say the characters are terrible, cause in all honesty they are. Besides Lucy, everyone else in the movie is just insignificant. Nameless henchmen, vapid villain, useless cop sidekick for the all powerful Lucy. Lucy herself said that: The more knowledge she acquires, the more she loses her human emotions. Or something along those lines. That really summarizes my opinion about her character. As the movie went on, the less I found myself caring. After she became a superhuman, her whole character just got more and more boring.Only time I was even remotely entertained during the movie, was when at the very start Morgan Freeman was giving his presentation about our cells and whatnot. Of course the whole thing was absolute bullcrap, but just Morgan Freeman alone made it worth listening. But just for a brief moment.",3,1,6,12 January 2016
The Sixth Sense," Didn't work for me
","The Sixth Sense is the movie that put certain M. Night Shyamalan to the map. I heard that this is an amazing movie and maybe my expectations were a bit high cause I didn't enjoy it.It's about a boy who sees terrible visions and a child psychologist who is trying to help him. I didn't like the story. I know Shyamalan tends to have twists in his movies, but the twist in this one didn't impress me. Maybe I spoiled the viewing experience for myself since I knew to look for the twist. Maybe I should have seen this movie when it came out to enjoy it more. Much of this comes down to my personal preference. And to be honest I don't like Shyamalan's directional style. The long takes were not that good. I didn't like his framing either.The movie was okay on the acting front. I liked Haley Joel Osment's performance. Bruce Willis and the rest of the cast were okay. M. Night Shyamalan made a brief appearance, which didn't really make me hold my breath.The good thing about the movie is it's overall creepiness and sense of fear. There were couple of jump scares that made me cringe. Having too much jump scares isn't necessarily a good thing, but the movie doesn't rely on them. Sometimes this movie reminded me about Shining with the hallucinations and everything. And no surprise here: I thought Kubrick did it much better.Some things don't appeal to everyone and this movie is an example. I just couldn't make myself to like it.",4,6,11,12 December 2014
The Purge," An interesting theme, but a mediocre movie
","The Purge certainly takes place in an interesting future. The premise was really interesting and during the first half hour I was confused why this movie had such a low rating. After the half hour mark I began to understand the low ratings. The movie turned into a mediocre horror thriller, and the backstory was more or less forgotten.Ethan Hawke was great from the start. So was Lena Headey. They had great chemistry as a husband and a wife and they shared some good moments, in my opinion. But they couldn't save the movie.The kids however were completely opposite to their parents. The son was perhaps the most annoying character in a horror movie ever. And how he got away with everything he did was just irritating. His character was there basically just to move the plot forward and have some kind of conflict and danger befall on the movie's family.The movie wasn't all that well made either. The jump scares were painfully obvious and were more of an annoyance than actual scare. The movie did feature one brutal fight scene, which was well executed and shot and Ethan Hawke really shined in it. It's a shame that the rest of the second half was so bad.",4,0,0,17 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Adrenaline boost! (for the most part)
","Boy what a ride! Crazy action and visuals. But the movie is far from perfect.The first hour of the movie was simply amazing. The movie dives straight into the world of Mad Max. I didn't question anything I just enjoyed the view. And for the first hour of it's runtime the movie more than delivered.It was in the second half, where I encountered some problems. The movie is essentially a 2 hour long car chase. The action doesn't revolve around the plot, the little plot this movie has revolves around the action. This was fine and I didn't even care about the lack of story, until the action stopped. Due to the lack of the story I was incredibly bored when there was no action. And I'm not even an action junkie. There simply were no substance apart from the action.It would seem that Charlize Theron's character Furiosa would be the most interesting character since she is the one who had perhaps the biggest story arc out of all the characters. But having the biggest story arc in this movie is not a whole lot. I actually found the title character Max by Tom Hardy the most interesting. His actions and his rough exterior fits him right into the movie's brutal world.Max was a lot better character than Furiosa. Her character was trying to have some emotional depth, but ultimately it fell short in my eyes. Probably due to the lack of story in the movie. Max was just a real fighter and a survivor and the filmmakers didn't even try to make the character anything more. I really liked that! Despite what their characters were in the movie, both Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy gave good performances. Tom Hardy sure knows how to grunt.Even though the action was amazing, I became a bit numb to it towards the end of the movie. The climax didn't have the same paralyzing effect to me anymore, like the first half of the movie did.Overall, it was an enjoyable movie. But I can't even think how awful it would have been if the action wasn't as good as it was.",7,0,4,7 October 2015
Macbeth," So much red
","Macbeth is visually stunning. Great landscapes, shots, everything. I didn't like certain slow motion scenes, particularly in the beginning of the film. The very beginning is actually the worst part of the movie. The movie takes some time to get started and it definitely gets better as it goes on. The third act and especially the ending is breathtakingly beautiful.My biggest problem with this movie is the old English they are speaking. English is not my first language, nor are my academic goals in English literature. It is nice to see that they stayed true to Shakespeare's writing but I can't make myself to enjoy the dialogue when it's spoken.Other than that the movie is good. Acting is great and the constant ambient score was nice.",8,6,8,10 January 2016
