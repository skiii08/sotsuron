Sucker Punch," Very Disappointing (This Will Be an Unpopular Opinion)
","I've wanted to see this film for years. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the execution. The cutaways between 'reality' or (mid-reality) and the fantasy fight sequences were abrupt, intrusive, and disjointed. I did not care for these sequences at all - they were uninspired and flashy but lacked depth and did not seem to fit with the flow of the film. I found myself only half-watching and waiting to return to the main plot. I think they would have fit in a different film (pure video-game or comic genre) but the contrast did not work for me at all. It was like watching two different movies that did not meld together. There could have been much more effective and satisfying ways to create fantasy worlds/alternate realities without cutting to contrived supposed 'dance sequences' that were never shown in lieu of a random collection of overblown battle/mission scenarios.All of this is before the letdown 'twist' ending. This movie could have been great in the right hands. I couldn't say if the problem was the script, direction, editing. It just didn't work for me on any level. The narration throughout the movie did nothing to help its cause and seemed like a pathetic attempt to bring higher meaning to a meaningless story.",3,1,6,7 May 2020
50 First Dates," Cute Movie
","I didn't have high expectations coming into this movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have great chemistry in this film, just as they do in 'The Wedding Singer.' The premise is unrealistic, obviously, but the characters are so colorful and likable that you are willing to suspend your disbelief and become involved in the story. I am a big skeptic in general, yet the movie managed to draw me in! There was a lot of warmth and real emotion in the movie in addition to the usual comedic performances by Sandler and Rob Schneider, who seems to present in every one of Sandler's movies in one form or another. The supporting cast also does a good job. Overall it is definitely enjoyable and worth watching :)",8,0,0,17 June 2005
Fight Club," I Hated This Movie
","I ordinarily don't take the time to comment on things of this nature, but this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! Fight Club had absolutely no plot and no message to give to the audience. It was replete with violence, sex, gore, all with no purpose whatsoever. The movie said nothing - it was just film and actors. If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be gratuity! There was gratuitous sex, violence, and blood and guts. Apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie, and I don't know what that says for our society and how easily we can be entertained. This movie is a waste of anyone's time. I highly recommend that you stay as far away from Fight Club as possible!",1,14,38,5 February 2000
The Babadook," Grotesque and Cruel
","Any movie that shows unwarranted harm to an animal automatically loses a number of points in my book. (I would have probably given the movie a 5/10 due to the incessantly annoying nature of the child, Samuel. I like kids but I couldn't help hating him, far before the Babadook ever entered the picture.) But, portraying the vicious murder of a defenseless dog was disgusting. It had already been depicted in the book - there was no need to have it play out in the movie, especially so graphically. The death of the dog wasn't necessary, but they especially didn't need to SHOW this scene. It could have been implied to even greater scare-factor. Shame on the filmmakers, and shame on viewers who use the defense 'it's only a movie.' That is never an excuse. 2/10 due to annoyances and animal cruelty",2,2,10,19 May 2015
Mamma Mia!," Entertaining But Lacking Depth
","This movie was enjoyable to watch in terms of the entertainment value (singing, dancing, musical numbers) but I found myself wanting more throughout the experience. For much of the movie I held the impression that the songs were placed merely to utilize yet another ABBA song, and did nothing to move the plot along (e.g., Christine Baranski's number on the beach, a few of the male character's numbers, the group numbers with Meryl Streep and the other two women). For example, although I love the song 'Dancing Queen' it seemed very contrived to have it performed by the three women in the hotel. Don't get me wrong - I liked the singing and the movie was quite visually appealing. Amanda Seyfried in particular was charismatic and had a beautiful voice. She was by far the musical star and I wished there were more numbers with her and not as many with the other characters. Meryl Streep did okay but she is ultimately not a singer and she was overshadowed by Christine Baranski and Julie Walters in the group numbers. One of her solo numbers 'Winner Takes it All' was painful to listen to. She does not have a very strong voice on her own, especially not in the softer ballads. Pierce Brosnan's attempts were quite unimpressive and somewhat comical. It would have been better if they had selected more actors that could actually sing, rather than selecting them for their name and reputation. Even so, I did like most of the songs and found myself considering purchasing the soundtrack or at least trying to track down the original versions.However, when I watch a movie, even a musical, I expect more than minimal scenes and character development to occur in between the numbers, such as what occurred in older musicals like 'Singing in the Rain.' Even a more modern tale like 'Grease' is better-developed because all of the songs fit with the same theme and the same characters and work to advance the story. In 'Mamma Mia' it was obvious to me that some of the songs were used just to be used but didn't necessarily fit. I don't know ABBA songs well enough to be able to tell you which ones these were, but it seemed like the script was loosely connected to incorporate much of ABBA'S repertoire, and many of the numbers were superfluous and didn't work with the storyline. I wanted to learn more about Sophie and Donna and didn't care as much about the peripheral characters, yet they performed many of the songs in the movie. I really wanted to see more of Amanda Seyfried, since she shined, but she wasn't on screen or singing enough for my taste.As another note, there were parts of the movie that didn't make much sense to me, possibly because there was not enough plot development (as I mentioned earlier) or else too many scenes ended up on the cutting room floor to make room for the musical numbers. At the end of the movie, when Rosie (Julie Walters' character) sings to Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), I was confused. Where in the world did this come from? I'm sure she was infatuated by him but the fact that she would put herself out there like that seemed to come out of nowhere. In addition, when Sam (Pierce Brosnan) spontaneously proposes to Donna (Meryl Streep), I was once again caught off guard. I understand they had this deep passionate affair, but how are we to believe that he would have held a candle for her all these years? All we are told is that she was in love with him and he said he was in love with her, but he was engaged, and he left to get married, and broke her heart. The singing scenes between to two of them prior to this point didn't do enough for me to make this believable.I realize that my opinion may differ from many others who watch this movie. I may be in the minority in that I had not seen the Broadway version and was not familiar with the songs and the story. Maybe I was harder to please because I didn't have a previous attachment to it. This movie may work better as a stage musical because you want everything to be fast-moving and entertaining and the actual story in between may not matter as much. When people go to see a Broadway Musical, they go for the music, and the story may be a distant second. But with films, they should still be movies along with musicals. This is my point of view. The movie musicals I most enjoy not only have great musical performances, but also have good acting, plot, and character development. That makes a well-rounded story. No, I don't expect every movie I watch to be Oscar caliber. I am perfectly content to be entertained by action movies or thrillers or comedies that may not emotionally touch you. However, in order to fully enjoy a movie and want to see it again, I find that I need to have some kind of connection with the characters and the story. In this case I am more likely to listen to the music than watch the film again, because, despite the major names and players, that's essentially what is was for me â€“ great musical numbers with a little bit of film in between.",6,0,2,17 January 2010
The Descent," Why Does Everyone Love This Movie?
","I don't quite understand the hype. Just watched it, finally, and had many expectations given a 7.3 rating here. To me, it wasn't outstanding or remarkable in any sense. The characters were mostly annoying. The movie was longer than it needed to be, and the scenes establishing the core group of women were too long and unnecessary. It was visually hard to watch due to darkness, abruptness, etc. After the threat was established, it was very repetitive (and repetitively gruesome). We saw the same fight and kill scenes over .... and over ...., and over. How many times do we need to see someone almost get eaten? How many different ways do we need to see creatures get killed? It was a gore-fest for sure, but that's not a positive attribute in my book. I guessed at the beginning that Juno was cheating with Sarah's husband, and even if you didn't, the movie certainly provided enough hints prior to this 'revelation.' Given the betrayal, I expected Juno's poetic end. The fooled-you ending was okay, but at that point, I didn't much care what happened.Note: I realized I happened to watch the unrated version. I can't speak for the content of any other versions, but I imagine the gore factor might have been somewhat lighter.",5,4,7,27 January 2015
