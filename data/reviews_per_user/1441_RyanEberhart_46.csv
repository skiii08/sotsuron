Angels & Demons," Superb!
","Angels & Demons is yet another movie which I liked very much. It is a sequel of The Da Vinci Code, but The Da Vinci Code is barely alluded to. Only mentioned as 'recent events' or some other vague wording, but I guess that is by design.Angels & Demons is very good because it deals with the murder of the Pope and the kidnapping of four Cardinals. The Cardinals are being held captive and the kidnapper has said he will execute them one at a time starting at 8 pm and then at 9, 10 and 11. At midnight a antimatter device will obliterate Rome.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is back and asked to find the antimatter container.He is joined in this hunt by Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) because she is the scientist that created the canister to hold the antimatter, and she can change the batteries of the container to prevent the explosion. Langdon and Vetra are also joined by Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) because he believes that Langdon is the best hope in finding both the canister and the four Cardinals. Carmelengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) and Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) round out the top of the character list, well except for the assassin (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) who doesn't have a name or at least it is never revealed.My favorite scenes are fairly good scenes. The first is the scene when Langdon saves the final Cardinal from being killed. Langdon witnesses the Cardinal being thrown into a fountain to drown. Jumping into the fountain, Langdon dives under the water but is unable to help the Cardinal alone because he has been strapped to a dolly with weights. Langdon grabs tube that is pumping air into the fountain to give the Cardinal SOME air. Eventually some nearby pedestrians come to Langdon's aide.The second scene I like is really a collection of scenes. I like Langdon's search for all the alters of science in or at which the Cardinals will be sacrificed on. At one time Langdon basically tells Commander Richter to, basically, help or get out of my way. Langdon also tells them all that he was asked to help by them, he implied that he would stand by or go home if they didn't give him some mutual help.The third scene I liked was when Langdon enters the archives of the Vatican a second time. This time Vittoria is not with him, but Chartrand (Thure Lindhardt) is present to make sure Langdon behaves himself this time. Alluding to the first time Langdon and Vittoria are in the Archives and Vittoria rips a page out of a pamphlet. Anyway, this time when Langdon and Chartrand are in the Archives they are trapped inside one of the sealed rooms when the power is being turned off in an effort to find the antimatter canister. The power being turned off turns off the air being pumped in the room. Chartrand tries to call for help on his two way, but the room is lead lined blocking any signal. Langdon topples a large shelving unit against a window hoping to break the glass, it doesn't work. Langdon then grabs the hand gun of the unconscious Chartrand and shoots the glass, it too doesn't appear to work. Langdon climbs up on the shelving unit in frustration and passes out. The glass has been weakened by the weight of the shelving unit, Langdon and the shots from the gun, and eventually breaks, allowing air to flood in to the room.There are other scenes I liked, but I won't describe them here. The reason I won't describe them here is because I would much rather you watch the movie. The script if very well written. Dan Brown's research into the practices of electing a new Pope is great.I can't wait until the next Robert Langdon adventure. The next one should take place in Washington, D. C. and a couple of other places along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Unfortunately there is no information on when The Lost Symbol will be released.I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars, for the storyline and all of the action.",10,1,6,4 September 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not One of the Best, But Still Good
","I have to say that I am surprised at the reception of the prequel trilogy. Many fans of the original trilogy were reluctant to accept these movies. Some thought that they took something away from the original movies. I disagree.I liked episodes 1 through 3 just as much as I liked 4 through 6, maybe even more. I like that the first three tell the story of Anakin Skywalker and what leads him to become Darth Vader. But beyond that it is the story of Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and her relationship with Anakin.Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a favorite but not at the top. Based on a 10 star rating I give it a 7. The story was pretty good, but the script and acting seemed a little forced at times.I do have many favorite scenes.The first favorite is when Quigon Jin (Liam Neeson) and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) first meet Jar Jar Binx. Quigon supposedly saves Jar Jar's life. The antics that follow make for some pretty good comic relief.My next favorite scene is the pod race scene. The whole scene is pretty cool. It shows the Tuskan Raiders, the Jawas and even Jabba the Hutt. I like the different things that happen just before, during and at the end of the pod race.The third favorite scene is the final fight scene between Qui-Gon Jin, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul (Ray Park). In the end Qui-Gon is killed by Darth Maul. But, Darth Maul is killed by Obi Wan Kenobi.The music is great. Especially in the pod race scene and the final Darth Maul fight scene. John Williams did a phenomenal job.I have already given my rating of this movie. What is yours?",7,3,5,3 October 2013
The Expendables 2," Way better than the first...
","Expendables 2 was a lot better than the first movie, the number of action stars who were cast in this movie increased and for the better. I like the addition of Jean-Claude Van Damme, Liam Hemsworth, Chuck Norris and Nan Yu to this movie; as well as the expanded roles of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. The plot was better than the first movie as well.The script itself could have been better, at least as far as some of the duologue, but for the most part was pretty satisfying. I have mixed feelings about some of the actors saying lines that the another actor said in other movie series. For instance, Bruce Willis says 'I'll be back' to Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arnold says 'Yippee-ki-yay.'I have several scenes I like in this movie, but I will only describe three.The first scene I liked, or really the first part of a scene I liked was the end of the rescue scene at the beginning of the movie. The Expendables are sent to rescue Dr. Zhou (Wenbo Li), they complete the mission, but also rescue Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger). To escape the compound that Dr. Zhou was being held hostage in the Expendables use some power lines as zip lines. Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) end up on the ground surrounded by enemy soldiers, they are ordered to drop their weapons and they do, Barney holds his index finger pointed out like a gun and does the motion of shooting the soldiers with his finger. The soldiers are shot but by a sniper named Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth).My next favorite scene is when the Expendables are on their plane heading to Albania. Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) attempts to flirt with Maggie (Nan Yu), but she rebuffs him. Maggie, however, befriends Billy the Kid just to spite Gunnar. Billy tells Maggie why he left the Army and it pretty much effects every member in the exact same way, not a dry eye was had within ear shot.Another favorite scene is after Billy is killed by Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) the Expendables vow to hunt Villain down. The Expendables end up staying the night in a mock-New York City training center somewhere in Eastern Europe, probably a hold over from the Cold War. The next morning as everyone is getting ready to attack Villain's group, Gunnar is still asleep on the floor snoring away. Barney yells out and wakes Gunnar up, to which Gunnar bellows 'You Rang'. I found this to be very hilarious.I won't tell you how this movie ends because it was that good. I will tell you that Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis played a huge role in the finale of the movie.I give this 9 stars out of 10. The blood still looked fake.",9,0,0,25 September 2013
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Awesome!
","Again, I love these movies! Milla Yovovich is back and better than ever, especially when the movie starts with multiple Milla Yovovich's in the character of Alice as clones of the real Alice.Resident Evil: Afterlife tells the story of the last of the human population that remains after the undead takes over planet Earth. It's not a story of defeating the enemy, it is the story of surviving. Some survive longer than others.Because this is the fourth movie of five, with a sixth one in the works, the fight scenes have to be more elaborate, the story has to be more involved, and the rest of the movie has to be action packed with little breathing room... and that's what we get in Resident Evil: Afterlife.Alice is back and she has a few friends, at least at the beginning. Alice brings several clones with her to attack the base for Umbrella in China. They are successful in gaining entrance to the facility and killing at least a hundred or two of Umbrella's Chinese contingent, but their main objective is the chairman of Umbrella himself, Albert Wesker. Wesker, played by Shawn Roberts, escapes the facility, setting off a cleansing explosion to rid him of the Alice clones and hoping that Alice herself is among them. Unfortunately, or fortunately, whichever way you decide to see it, Alice lives. She attacks Wesker as he is trying to escape, but Wesker has a surprise. Wesker injects Alice with a serum that neutralizes the T-Virus and reverts Alice back to being JUST human. Alice thanks Wesker. The plane they are in crashes and we see only Alice has apparently survived. Of course this is my first favorite scene, but you knew that.My second favorite scene is a short one. It's the scene where Alice and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) are in the Yakovlev Yak-52, a Russian aircraft, and they are attempting to land on the roof of a prison in Los Angeles. They are successful, but just barely. Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) helps by running across the prison roof in time to jump up and grab the tail of the plane pulling it back down before the plane topples over the edge of the roof. Pretty good scene.The third of my favorite scenes is when Alice and Chris Redfield, Claire's brother, go to the armory of the prison. To do this they have to swim down two floors and over several yards because the sump pumps need electricity to work and the electricity has been out for a long time. They are joined by Crystal, played by Kacey Barnfield, and make it through the water. Before they can get away from the water too far, Crystal is attacked and taken. Alice and Chris (Wentworth Miller) make it to the armory; Alice is impressed.Since my second favorite is a short scene, I'll give a bonus favorite. My fourth favorite scene is the fight scene between Alice and Wesker, along with Claire, Chris, Bennett, and two infected dogs that Wesker seems to be able to control. Alice ends up knocking Bennett (Kim Coates) out and kills both dogs. One of the dogs is killed when Alice kicks a large piece of falling glass towards the dog who has jumped towards Alice. The glass impales the dog, killing it instantly. Alice then defeats Wesker, and leaves with Claire and Chris, leaving Bennett locked in the room with a seemingly defeated Wesker.A short bonus favorite scene is when we see Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) for the first time since the second movie. However, she is only in the final scene of the movie. Jill is the commander of a strike force sent to the ship Arcadia to recapture all those on board, especially Alice.I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. I loved it! I thought it was the best one yet. How could it get better? Read the next review on Resident Evil: Retribution to find out.Oh, I forgot to mention the scene with the eight foot tall mutant. It takes place in the shower. At some point the mutant knocks some water pipes out and water is flying everywhere. This scene is awesome because Claire and Alice are now fighting the mutant in skin tight wet clothes. AWESOME! Hey, what can I say, I'm a guy. Get over it!",10,6,13,1 September 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Palatable
","As a historian it is hard for me to like this movie, but I did find this an enjoyable movie. Not as good as Bram Stoker's Dracula with Gary Oldman, but still a pretty good vampire movie. The action is pretty good, the vampire hunting is excellent.The pace of this movie pretty fast as we begin our story when Abraham loses his mother. She was poisoned by a Vampire named Barts. His father makes him promise not to go after Barts. Abraham promises but only keeps this promise until his father passes away.The movie is different from the book as there are many things that have been changed. There is no mention of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather being killed by vampires. There is no mention of Anne Rutledge, although in the book she plays a major role but is killed in the same manner as Abraham's mother. Willie Lincoln's death in the movie is attributed to the same sickness that killed his grandmother.Another scene that should have been in this movie was that John Wilkes Booth had been turned into a vampire. Abraham Lincoln was shot and his friend Henry turned him into a vampire instead of letting Lincoln die. However, Lincoln was turned at a time when nobody was around so everyone thought he was still dead.The novel idea that Abraham Lincoln was a vampire hunter and had killed several vampires over the years is a pretty good idea. It is an amazing twist that the Civil War was fought to free the slaves because the vampires used slaves as food. It was not only humans that fought on the side of the south but vampires as well.As a movie based on a book that is complete fiction wrapped around historical fact this is a very good movie. I would give this a 7 out of 10 stars, simply because the action and story is fairly well thought out. Timur Bekmambetov did a very good job directing this movie, and adapting it from the book of the same name. But, as a historian, I can't bring myself to like this movie too much.",7,0,1,8 August 2013
Star Trek," Excellent!
","Being a Star Trek fan does not mean you have to be a geek or a nerd. It just means you like one of the most profitable Science Fiction franchises of all time, only rivaled by the Star Wars franchise. I understand that there are some people out there that will say that they hate one of these two franchises, I am going to say something that will make them vomit. I am a fan of both franchises. Why can't you be a fan of one and a fan of the other?That being said, I actually liked Star Trek. I think J. J. Abrams did a fantastic job breathing new life back into this franchise. He took all that we know about the universe of Star Trek and turned it on it's ear. J. J. Abrams was very smart about it, too.I don't want to give too much of the movie away because I think that it should be experienced rather than read about. Therefore I will give a couple of scenes that I like but I won't give too much detail. That said I will only tell you about scenes from the beginning to the middle of the movie.One of the best scenes of the first half of the movie is when young James T. Kirk (Jimmy Bennett) is driving his step-father's (?) vintage automobile, basically joy riding, when he is about 12 years old. The step-father calls on the in-dash phone and starts yelling at James to return the car, James hangs up. A police officer (robot?) gives chase and tries to pull James over, James takes a side road. The road he is on now ends at a deep ravine. James turns the steering wheel to the left, opens the driver's door and leaps from the car. The car falls over the edge into the ravine, but James is safe and as he stands the robo-cop asks his name. The way James answers is pretty funny as he says his name with dignity, and a little haughtiness.The next scene I liked was when James meets Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Bones (Karl Urban). James meets Uhura in a bar. Some Star Fleet cadets intercede in his attempt to get to know her better, yeah like that would have happened, by starting a fight with James. James was able to handle himself pretty well, at the beginning, but eventually the six on one odds caught up to him. He is saved from a severe (severer?) beating by Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Captain Pike offers James the opportunity to join Star Fleet, but the offer is refused. Thinking it over James joins Star Fleet. When he joins the other cadets on the transport ship he sits next to Bones and they strike up a quick friendship.The third scene I like is the one in which James beats the Kobayashi Maru. The Kobayashi Maru is a un-winnable test in which the crew of a star ship has to rescue the crew of another, but there are several enemy ships surrounding the crippled ship. James has taken this test twice before but he has gained an advantage... he cheated by reprogramming the test. James wins, but he is brought up on charges of cheating and breaking the honor code of Star Fleet. James asks to face his accuser, Spock (Zachary Quinto) comes to the front of the auditorium. The scene ends not long after this, but I still like it. It's also two scenes.I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. The graphics are beyond phenomenal. The plot and script was great. As I said before, J.J. Abrams was able to breath new life into this franchise. Also, it doesn't hurt that Leonard Nimoy had more than just a simple cameo role as Spock Prime.",10,1,1,21 September 2013
The Hunger Games," Excellent!
","The Hunger Games is one of the best movies of the last few years. Released a year and a half ago, The Hunger Games has grossed nearly $500 million; with a budget of $78 million. Suzanne Collins, with the help of Gary Ross and Billy Ray, wrote the screenplay for The Hunger Games using the book of the same name as a guide. The screenplay is as close to the book as possible given that the author is Suzanne Collins herself.Suzanne Collins created an amazing story about a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capital. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part Entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Penem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. (The Hunger Games storyline, IMDb.com)Since this movie is more than a year old I can safely describe my three favorite scenes and not feel guilty about giving away any surprises.The first scene I liked was the when Katniss volunteered to take her sister's place as tribute. All the teens assemble in order to be selected as tribute. They are selected by lottery, with each having their names entered at least once, many several times. Katniss is worried that Prim, who is only 12, would not be able to survive the brutal combat. In order to save her sister when her name is called, Katniss volunteers to go in Prim's place. It is an emotional scene, as is the scene in which Katniss is saying goodbye to Gale, Prim and her mother.The second scene I liked was actually the sequence of scenes that each district representatives are in training. It is here that Katniss and Peeta gain allies and support. My favorite part is when Katniss shoots an arrow in the direction of the judges. It is not well received.My third favorite scene is when Katniss kills Marvel. Marvel, the male tribute from District 1, attacks Katniss and Rue. Katniss dodges Marvel's spear and shoots an arrow at Marvel killing him. Katniss turns to Rue and sees that the spear she dodged had instead impaled Rue through her chest. Rue dies in Katniss's arms. Katniss decides that to honor her friend and ally she would decorate Rue with wildflowers. Rue's family and the rest of District 11 appreciate the sentiment that Katniss showed. Upon seeing the last of his daughter before her body was taken away, Rue's father and many of the other men in District 11 start a riot.I loved The Hunger Games. The graphics were amazing. The storyline was awesome. I could see how some of the things in the story could actually happen.I would, however, suggest that before you watch any of the movies in The Hunger Games series, please read the books.I give The Hunger Games 10 stars out of 10.",10,2,6,25 November 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Excellent!
","For the Star Trek purists out there Star Trek Into Darkness must have been a slap in the face. I call it a masterful rework of a classic in which one of the evilest characters to come out of the Star Trek universe, ever, was once again matched up against the Enterprise crew and her captain. J.J. Abrams outdid his work in the first movie of this new series when he reworked the script of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan to create Star Trek Into Darkness.As this is a movie that came out this year I will not tell you how it ended. But, what I will tell you is that if you watched The Wrath of Khan and then you watch Into Darkness, you will either be pleasantly surprised at some of the reversals in what happens to some of the characters, or you will be angered beyond compare. I doubt there is any in between.What I will do is tell you about three scenes from the beginning of the movie up to about the half way point. I liked that the same cast from the first movie was back with some additions that were pretty good as well as visually appealing, I'll explain that later.The first scene I liked was when Dr. 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban) and Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) are supposed to be observing a primitive alien species. Unfortunately, a volcano threatens to destroy the planet and it is decided to 'freeze' the lava before it can do it's job. In the process of stopping the volcano Spock (Zachary Quinto) is trapped inside the volcano. After escaping the indigenous peoples of the planet Kirk violates the Prime Directive by directly affecting the development of the civilization when he reveals his ship to them. The primitive aliens abandon their religion and begin to worship the Enterprise. This is pretty funny. Spock says the line 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few.' This line was said by Leonard Nimoy as Spock in Wrath of Khan, and Leonard Nimoy said it again in The Transformers Dark of the Moon as Sentinel Prime.Another scene I liked was when Spock mind-melded with Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood) as Pike lay dying. Pike had been wounded by John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who turned out to be Khan. Later it is revealed that when Spock did his mind-meld with Spock he felt fear, anger, confusion, loneliness and that he had felt these emotions before when Vulcan was destroyed. He vowed never to feel these emotions again which is why he couldn't comprehend why Nyoto Uhura (Zoe Saldana) was upset with him for taking the risk he did to stop the volcano.Another scene I liked is when McCoy and Dr. Carol Marcus (Eve Alice) attempt to see what is so special about the photon torpedoes they were given to launch at Khan to destroy him. I won't tell what was so special, just know that this was a nice twist. At the same time, I think it was amazing what Kirk sent Scotty (Simon Pegg) to investigate. Again I won't give away what he found.Eve Alice is what I meant by visually pleasing. She was the lead actress in one of my favorite comedy movies, She's Out Of My League. Very funny. She is very attractive and in my opinion an underrated actress because of her attractiveness.Again J.J. Abrams brings amazing graphics and rewrites a script to make a masterful epic movie.I give Star Trek Into Darkness 10 stars out of 10 stars.",10,2,7,22 September 2013
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Pretty Damn Good!
","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is based on a video game, but this is more than a video game homage. In the previous movie I reviewed Jake Gyllenhaal played a political cartoonist turned amateur detective. In this movie he plays a prince who is capable of incredible gymnastic feats.The movie begins by talking about the Kingdom of Persia. Persia was an empire that existed long ago. Many of the stories about Persia are a part of myths and legend... this included. But of course the creator of the video games and the writer for this movie did a pretty good job researching Persia in order to create a realistic looking story.Prince Dastan (Gyllenhaal) is an orphan and street urchin as a child. As a young boy he saves a friend from being beaten by a guard for stealing an apple. The way he does this is performing his incredible gymnastic flips and jumps. The king of Persia, King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), witnesses this act of courage by Dastan. After hearing the Dastan doesn't have parents, Sharaman adopts Dastan as his son and raises him as his own to be brother to his biological sons.Years later, Prince Tus (Richard Coyle), Prince Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Prince Dastan along with their uncle, Nizam (Ben Kingsley) and their army attack Alamut. A spy reported that Alamut was supplying weapons for the enemies of Persia. Dastan does what he does best and allows the Persian army to enter Alamut and conquered it. In Alamut, Dastan discovers not only his destiny but the truth. He also discovers Temina (Gemma Arterton), Princess of Alamut.Prince of Persia is not only a fantasy story, it is also a love story. For in this movie Dastan and Temina fall in love as the story continues. However, in the end Dastan is the only one who remembers.There are many scenes I like about this movie. I like Dastan's gymnastic abilities. I love the fact that Gemma Arterton was cast to play Temina; she is very beautiful woman.This movie gets 9 stars out of 10 from me.",9,0,0,3 January 2014
Terminator Salvation," Great movie! Great special effects! Great Action!
","Terminator Salvation is my second favorite movie of this series. I like it because it actually tells the story of the war between humans and machines, or at least a little part of that war. However, I was a little upset that John Connor (Christian Bale) was not the leader of the human resistance, just a unit leader, but by the end of this installment that will be rectified.The special effects and graphics are very good. The fight scenes are pretty awesome. The script and plot are very good. I like that the scars on John Connor's face we have come to see on all the actors who have played him are explained.According to IMDb.com fans have given Terminator Salvation an average score of 6.7 stars. I actually give Terminator Salvation 9 stars, I couldn't wait for the war between humans and machines to be depicted. That is why this is my second favorite of these movies. Perhaps the scores have been so low because time-travel wasn't a part of the script, or was it? How did Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) die in 2003 and wake up in 2018?There are many great scenes in this movie that I liked, however, I will only describe three (as usual).My first favorite scene is when Marcus meets Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and Star (Jadagrace). It's a little sparse as far as action or speaking go, but it is the first time we see Kyle as a teenager. And really it is the first time we have seen this character since the first movie. Although, there was a scene in T2 that didn't make it to the theatrical version where Kyle comes to Sarah in a dream.The next favorite scene is when Marcus escapes from John Connor's resistance compound. He is helped by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). He has to escape in order to rescue Star and Kyle, but really he has to escape because it has been discovered that he is a Cyborg. But he is not like the Terminators we have come to know. Marcus has a human mind and heart, but everything else is robotic. John Connor goes against everything he believes in in order to save his father, Kyle; John lets Marcus go hoping that Marcus can help save Kyle.The last favorite scene is when Marcus gives John his heart. Marcus had been a convicted murderer in 2003, and was sentenced to death by lethal injection; which was carried out. However, he was revived by CRS aka Skynet, to infiltrate the resistance. But, Marcus redeems himself, both as a human and a machine by giving John his heart. I believe this is where the salvation comes in. Marcus is the salvation of everything; he helps save Kyle, he helps save John, and he ultimately helps save the resistance.I almost forgot. Kate Connor (nee Brewster) is played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Bryce is Ron Howard's daughter. I think this was a great casting choice. I have liked everything that I have seen her in. It doesn't hurt that she is a redhead, which is my favorite hair color. Or, more accurately, she is usually a redhead.These are my thoughts on this damn good movie. What do you think?",9,0,2,30 September 2013
Resident Evil: Extinction," Excellent!
","I love this series. I love some of these movies more than the others, and for different reasons. I won't go into those reasons, I'm just glad I can talk about another Resident Evil movie.I will tell you that I am happy that Milla Yovovich is back in this third Resident Evil movie. In this movie though we see multiple Alices, as Umbrella has cloned Alice in an attempt to figure out why the T-Virus reacts the way it does in Alice. Unfortunately for Umbrella without the real Alice, they can't complete their research.Joining Milla Yovovich is Ali Larter as Claire Renfield, returning is Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera, and joining the cast is Spencer Locke as K- Mart. The story line is pretty good in this Resident Evil. Paul W.S. Anderson did a very good job creating a story line that catches and keeps the viewers attention; only a little absurd toward the end when we get to Dr. Isaacs becoming a mutant.My favorite scenes begin with when Alice joins Claire Redfield's convoy, about 10 minutes or so into the movie. The convoy has stopped at an abandoned motel for the night. When they wake in the morning it is to find a couple hundred crows all over the camp site. At one point K-Mart notices the eyes of a crow and asks about them. Claire replies that the birds have been eating infected flesh; crows being carrion birds. However, the best part of this scene is that the crows start attacking the different vehicles and are successful in many respects as they kill several characters. But it is when Carlos runs the protect a young girl from the crows and then a flame thrower that Alice joins in the fight. Alice stops the flames from reaching Carlos and then turns the fire against the crows, killing them all.I loved the scene closer to the beginning of the movie where Alice goes to an abandoned radio station. Alice gets ambushed by what appears to be a family of degenerates. One of the men attempts to prove how much of a man he is by attempting to rape Alice. Unfortunately for the man, Alice kicks him in the face and kills him. One of the other members of the family knocks Alice out. Alice wakes in a pit, and realizes that there are some infected dogs. Alice avoids the dogs and uses some electrical cables to tie them to a support post holding up the floor the family are on watching the events below. The dogs are pulling so hard that they pull the post down causing the floor to come crashing down. The family are deposited for fodder for the dogs, and Alice escapes.My next favorite scene is the fight scene between Alice and Dr. Isaacs, or I should say the mutated Dr. Isaacs. Everything that Alice does to try to kill Isaacs is a futile attempt because Isaacs can heal himself. However, Alice and Isaacs make it to the corridor with the lasers where Alice attempts to sacrifice herself in order to kill Isaacs. Killing Isaacs is successful, but an Alice clone saves Alice by turning off the lasers.A bonus scene I liked was when the different department heads are 'meeting' with Albert Wesker to discuss the different items going on around Umbrella, especially in North America with Dr. Isaacs. After deciding to writing off the North American facility and deciding to transfer all data to China, Alice crashes the meeting (holographically) and warns everyone that she is going to hunt them all down. When she leaves the meeting, the camera pulls back and you see how many clones of Alice Umbrella has made.I give this 10 out of 10 stars. The story is great, especially depicting Las Vegas being reclaimed by the desert. The fight scenes are more elaborate. Milla Yovovich teaming with Ali Larter in this movie just increases the eye candy; it doesn't hurt to have Spencer Locke either. And for the ladies, you have Oded Fehr and a few others.",10,4,5,30 August 2013
Zodiac," Pretty Damn Good!
","I like crime dramas that make you think and Zodiac certainly does just that. For those readers of this blog Zodiac is based on a real life crime in which a serial killer in California in the late 1960's and early 1970's killed at least 7 people and wounded 2, those were confirmed. Another five victims are suspected of being committed by Zodiac. The reason this is such an interesting story is because of the mystery and that the crime has never been solved.The movie, made in 2007, follows pretty much all of the actual events. Some of the victims were switched around. There is a lot of the story that pertains to the personal lives of the newspapermen and detectives.Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) catches the amateur detective bug when he sees the first cipher the Zodiac killer sent to The San Francisco Chronicle in 1969. Graysmith was a political cartoonist turned true crime author. Because of the Zodiac case Graysmith changed careers; in the movie it almost became an obsession to the point that it cost him his marriage, or so it seemed.In the movie, Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) catch the case of the attack in San Francisco. They consolidate all of the other attacks and pretty much take over the investigations. Eventually Inspector Armstrong leaves the investigation because the investigation has gone cold. Inspector Toschi is eventually removed from the case because he was accused of writing one of the several letters The Zodiac sent to one of the newspapers.One of the prime suspects, Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), is investigated several times. All the evidence pointed to Allen, especially after Graysmith began his investigation and started piecing everything together. One of the clues was a phone call that Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) received, or rather his housekeeper, the caller, presumably The Zodiac, mentioned it was his birthday. Graysmith figures out that the date The Zodiac called was December 18th, which so happens to be Allen's birthday. However, before Allen could be brought in Allen died of a fatal heart attack.I actually liked this movie. All the actors played their roles pretty well. I give this 9 stars out of 10.",9,1,1,1 January 2014
The Terminator," Excellent!
","The Terminator is a classic! Yes, I said a classic. Of the four movies so far this is my third favorite, behind the third and fourth movies.The graphics are just what you would expect from a movie that was made in the early 1980's. At the time the graphics were state of the art. However, today they are antiquated, which makes this a classic.The story was unique. Before 1984 there were scripts and plots that had robot that looked robotic, or monsters that looked like monsters. In 1984, James Cameron gave us The Terminator, a machine that can't be 'bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.'The script revolves around Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who is the mother of John Connor, a future leader who fights and eventually defeats Skynet. Skynet developed technology to travel back in time in the hopes of killing Sarah Connor to prevent John Connor's birth. The human resistance sends Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to save Sarah Connor and stop, if possible, the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger).As always I will list my three favorite scenes. As this movie has been around for nearly 30 years I have no issue in including any scene from the beginning to the end.The first scene I liked was when Sarah is in the nightclub waiting for the cops. She is being followed by Reese and the Terminator. When the Terminator walks by the table Sarah happens to drop something on the floor and bends over to pick it up. The Terminator eventually sees Sarah and moves in for the kill, but Reese intervenes.The second scene I liked was actually all of the flashback scenes for Reese. They were flashback scenes for Reese but would be flash-forwards for us. It gets a little confusing for when you talk about time travel.The third scene I liked was the final scene when Sarah defeats the Terminator. Reese is killed when he puts a pipe bomb in some of the Terminators gears. The resulting explosion kills Reese, cripples the Terminator, and injures Sarah. Sarah defeats the Terminator by crushing it.Before I finish this review I do have something to say. I could have gone my whole life without seeing the naked asses of either Michael Biehn or Arnold Schwarzenegger.I give this 8 stars out of 10.",8,0,1,27 September 2013
Gettysburg," Excellent!
","Movie Review - Gettysburg: This is one of my all time favorite movies. It was released in 1993 and stars Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, Stephen Lang and Jeff Daniels. For those that aren't history buffs or Civil War buffs this movies tells the story of the Battle of Gettysburg fought during the Civil War on July 1 through July 3, 1863 in Gettysburg, PA. For those that are history buffs or Civil War buffs you might agree that there are some discrepancies but not enough to make this movie a complete disaster in the telling of this battle.Gettysburg is based on a book called Killer Angels written by Michael Shaara, published in 1974. Michael Shaara passed away five years before the release of Gettysburg in 1988. Usually the adaptation from book to movie is quite different, names are changed, scenes are changed, but this is not the case with Gettysburg.It would be counterproductive to give a detailed account or retell the whole story about this battle based on what is depicted in the movie. I say this because the movie is four and half hours long. I will point our the three scenes I find most poignant.The first scene I like is actually a collection of scenes that lead up to the death of Major General John F. Reynolds, played by John Rothman. A Union Calvary unit under Brigadier General John Buford has engaged the Confederate Army at Gettysburg and has held his ground waiting for Reynolds to bring his unit to Gettysburg. When Buford finally sees Reynolds' unit arrive Buford visibly is relieved.The second scene is of Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain's 20th Maine Infantry defending their position at Little Roundtop. After several hours and successfully repulsing the Confederates at least a half dozen times the 20th Maine Infantry is dangerously low on ammunition; this prompts Chamberlain to make the decision to have his soldiers to fix bayonets and charge down hill into the Confederates. Do this catches the Confederates off guard and many surrender.The final scene I like another collection that depicts Pickett's Charge. I won't go into detail about this scene as I would like very much if you watch the scene for yourself. I will say that in 2010 I took a course for my Masters in which we took a tour of nine Civil War battlefields in seven days. Gettysburg was the final battlefield we visited and we walked the route that was used for Pickett's Charge. It is a march of more than a mile over open ground, in which the Confederate soldiers were within range of Union Artillery. Imagine walking more than a mile wearing wool in heat, probably near 90 or 100 degrees, with high humidity and high dew point.I recommend this movie highly for those that are interested in Civil War history or history in general. I recommend this movie for those that even like war or action movies. There are some very graphic scenes, especially after the second days fighting is done and General Longstreet is walking through a makeshift hospital where amputations are being depicted.",10,0,0,23 July 2013
The Expendables," Could have been better
","Expendables was not exactly my favorite but I would have to say that for the most part it was a decent action movie. With the amount of actors that were cast in this movie that had huge success in other franchises it was a little bit of a disappointment for me to see this movie at the level it was. I would have expected better.That being said, there are a few scenes that I found pretty good. Incidentally these are the most action packed scenes of the entire movie. Go figure.The first scene I liked was when Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) fly down to Vilena, an island in the Gulf of Mexico (fictional, of course). They are doing reconnaissance for a job to take out the dictator of the island. Ross and Christmas witness local soldiers terrorizing the citizens of the island and being directed by James Munroe (Eric Roberts) and Paine (Steve Austin). The best part of the whole scene is when Ross and Christmas escape the island, but end up taking out the dock area they landed their plane. The do this, Christmas first fires Browning M2 Aircraft machine guns quad-mounted into the nose of the plane. Then fuel is dumped on the dock, dousing the remaining soldiers and Munroe and Paine, Christmas then fires a M8 Flare Pistol at the dock to ignite the fuel.The next scene I liked was when Christmas gets home he goes over to his girlfriend's house only to find that she, Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) is seeing another guy. Lacy explains that she only moved on because even when Christmas was home he wasn't really home, and that she really didn't know him. But the best scene for this little triangle is when Christmas goes to Lacy's house and discovers that her boyfriend, Paul (Hank Amos), has hit Lacy. Christmas and Lacy get on his motorcycle to go have a chat with Paul. Paul is playing basketball with a five or six other guys when Lacy and Christmas show up. Christmas takes out every single one of them, leaving them alive, but tells Paul that the next time he comes near Lacy and lays a hand on her he will deflate all of Paul's balls.The best scene by far is the scene in which Ross and Christmas, along with the other members of their mercenary force, storm the President's Palace on Vilena. They are doing this to take out the dictator, General Garza (David Zayas), as well as Munroe and Paine. They are also trying to rescue Sandra (Giselle Itie'), General Garza's daughter. Near the end of the scene Munroe has a gun pointed at Sandra and he asks Ross why he was coming after him; Ross answers that he was coming for the girl not him, and then shoots Munroe several times before Christmas throws a knife through his chest.Another great scene is the chase scene through the city the Expendables live in. I hate that the 1955 Ford 100 truck that Barney Ross was driving got destroyed, I like older vehicles like that one. The fight between Yin Yang (Jet Li) and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) at the end of this chase scene was pretty cool.I think I named all the headliners. Oh wait! I forgot Bruce Willis as Church and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench, they weren't in the movie for very long, a total of about 7 or 8 minutes.Anyway, this could have been a hell of a lot better. The graphics, especially the blood splatter from gun shot wounds, was exaggerated; probably to allow for better visual effect, but it looked fake. I guess that was the point. A lot of the weapons were pretty cool. I like the weapon that Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) used. Sorry, I forgot a headliner.The script was OK. Tool's (Mickey Rourke) story of being in Bosnia (?) was touching, especially when he started to get choked up.Anyway, I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars. It could have been way better.",7,0,1,24 September 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Pretty Good
","The second installment of the new Star Wars series was far better than it's predecessor. However, I didn't like how they portrayed Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) as a petulant child. This portrayal was carried over to the next movie where is always whining that 'it's not fair.'Star Wars, Episode II: Attack of the Clones adds onto the story the was started in Phantom Menace but takes place ten years later. Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is no longer Queen of Naboo, instead she has been elected Senator. As Senator she represents the planet of Naboo in the Galactic Senate. Anakin Skywalker has progressed in his training as a Padawan Learner in the Jedi Order with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) as his Master.Even though they portrayed Anakin as a whining child, I did like this movie.Of course there are scenes in this movie that I like more than others.The first scene I liked is when Anakin and Obi-Wan are chasing Zam Wessell (Leeanna Walsman) after her second attempt to assassinate Padme. The chase scene is pretty elaborate and kind of fun. In the end Zam is killed by another assassin before she can reveal anything to Anakin or Obi-Wan. The other assassin turns out to be Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison).The next scene I like was when Anakin goes in search of his kidnapped mother. He finds her just before she dies. In his grief, Anakin slaughters the Tusken Raiders who have held her captive. Anakin didn't just kill the men, he killed the women and children too. This is the event that begins Anakin's path to the Dark Side and to his new identity as Darth Vader.The last scene I liked in this takes place after Anakin and Padme are captured on Geonosis. They are taken to an arena where they are to executed along with Obi-Wan. They are joined in their fight by several Jedi, including Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and eventually a clone army. At the end of the scenes on Geonosis Anakin has been wounded by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) when his arm was severed.I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars. The graphics were pretty good, especially Yoda's light saber fight with Count Dooku.",8,5,8,6 October 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," Great movie! Great special effects! Great Action!
","I thought this movie was very well done. I liked the special effects, especially with Chris Evans as Steve Rogers before he is transformed into Captain America. The action scenes are great. I liked how Captain America rescued nearly 400 POWs almost single handed. This seems to wipe away any animosity Col. Chester Phillips may have had towards Steve Rogers.Captain America's love interest only connects at the end of the movie when Peggy Carter finally kisses Captain America before he jumps onto a plane for the final show down with Red Skull. After defeating Red Skull, Steve Rogers/Captain America has to crash the plane because it is carrying bombs that are due to destroy New York and several other major cities along the eastern seaboard of the United States. He completes his task of destroying the plane but he is talking to Peggy through the radio and promises to meet her for a date.After crashing the plane, it is assumed Captain America is Missing in Action. He is found and revived after spending 70 years in a sort of cryogenic stasis in the Arctic.Great movie! Can't wait for the sequel in 2014.",9,0,2,16 July 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," Awesome!
","If I had to choose one of these films I would definitely choose this one as my favorite. I didn't choose this one because the action is great. I didn't choose this one because the chase scenes are pretty damn good. I chose this one because Julia Stiles plays a much bigger role in this one than the other two together. I have a crush on Julia Stiles, sue me.Let's get my favorite scenes out of the way. The first scene I like is the train station scene. I like how Jason Bourne tries to help Simon Ross, a journalist. Simon Ross is writing a newspaper article about Bourne, Treadstone, and Blackbriar. The CIA tries to take out Simon Ross and, despite the help of Jason Bourne, succeeds.My next favorite scene is when Jason and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) take a trip to Tangier. Jason and Nicky get separated and an assassin is sent after both of them because they were trying to get information from Neal Daniels. The assassin, Desh Bouksani, kills Daniels and thinks he kills Bourne. Bourne realizes that he and Nicky are now in danger and chases after Desh to save Nicky. The best part of Bourne chasing after Desh is his running along the rooftops of Tangier and getting into a fist fight with Desh.The next favorite scene is Jason being chased across New York City. At one point he drives off the roof of a parking structure, which begins the chase. He steals a police car and is chased by another assassin named Paz. Paz forces Jason into a barricade and they both crashes. They both survive the crash and Jason aims a gun at Paz, but doesn't pull the trigger. Later Paz asks Jason why he didn't pull the trigger. Jason doesn't answer, but he asks Paz if he even knows why Paz is supposed kill him.I suggest watching all of these movies. I give this 10 stars out of 10.",10,2,3,11 August 2013
The Bourne Identity," Love it!
","I love this movie. I like the action, the drama, and the especially the chase scenes. Matt Damon does a phenomenal job bringing this character to life as only he can. Like so many other actors in so many other roles it isn't easy to imagine someone else in those roles.I have listed favorite scenes in other movies, but not all movies I have reviewed. I have three scenes that I especially like.The first scene I like is when Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franke Potente) leave Bourne's Paris apartment. They are cornered and Jason decides to run, but he is trying to get Marie to leave. Marie doesn't want to leave so Jason brings her along for the ride. And what a ride it is!Jason drives an Austin Mini Cooper through the streets of Paris to escape the Paris Police. One of the best parts is when he drives the car down a set of stairs. He escapes the police and does so with flare. Can you imagine having a high speed car chase in a Mini Cooper? I think it is funny as hell.The next best scene is when Jason confronts The Professor (Clive Owen), another agent like Bourne. He does this with flare as well. Bourne blows up a large propane tank to distract The Professor. Then Bourne runs into a field and is able to shoot and wound The Professor. After getting little information from him, Bourne watches as The Professor dies.The last of my favorite scenes is after Bourne confronts Conklin (Chris Cooper), his former boss. Bourne hits Conklin and renders him unconscious, seconds later Bourne must fight his way out of the apartment building by killing four agents. One agent he kills by shooting through the forehead while falling through the air and landing on the body of one of the agents.I do have some advice for those that want to read the books by Robert Ludlum or Eric Van Lustbader. Don't read the books thinking that you will be able to follow the movies. I have only ever read the first book. The only similarity between the first book and the first movie is as follows: the title, many of the character names, and Jason Bourne's amnesia. The rest of the book is completely different from the movie. I have to say that that was probably as it was supposed to be, since the book was released in 1980 and the movie came out 22 years later.I give this movie 10 stars out of 10.",10,1,2,11 August 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Best of the Four (so far)
","Of the four Terminator movies this is my favorite. I like Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines because it actually tells the story of how the machines takes over. I get that the first two movies are an important part of the story but to me they were a shadowy prelude to this movie.The graphics are just as good, if not better, as the graphics in the second movie. And a hundred times better than the first movie. The premise of this movie is very well thought out, especially when the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) explains that the apocalypse was only delayed not averted. The Terminator says that the apocalypse is inevitable.According to Internet Movie Database movie fans that have rated this movie has rated in on average 6.4 stars. I however, have to give this 9 stars out of 10. I gave it 9 stars because the evil Terminator was a woman this time, and she was hot. Also, there were many great scenes, even the one where the good Terminator has to get clothes. Yes, I know Arnold is naked in this scene and I shouldn't be talking about this, but it is funny that he goes into a local strip club... on ladies night. The Terminator scanning for appropriate clothing is hilarious. However, I did like the evil Terminator looking for clothes more to my liking.The three best scenes are as follows, at least in my opinion.The first scene I liked was the scene in which the evil Terminator (Kristanna Loken) tracks down John Connor's lieutenants, before they become his lieutenants. I don't like that she is killing these people. What I like is that she is so methodical and cold. The best part is when she comes to the animal clinic looking for Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), but finds John Connor (Nick Stahl).The next best scene takes place just after the first favorite. It's the chase scene where John is driving the animal clinic's truck with Kate in the back. The evil Terminator is driving a Terex-Demag AC 160, better known as a crane truck. The good Terminator is driving a motorcycle. The good Terminator is knocked off the motorcycle but ends up hanging from the end of the crane. However, he ends up getting knocked off the crane by a fire engine. The sequence of this scene is nothing short of remarkable.The third and final best scene is when the two Terminators are fighting at the airforce base Kate's father, General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), is commanding and in charge of Skynet. The fight scene is fairly awesome and a little drawn out. There is a breakaway scene that shows Kate and John escaping, Kate grabs a machine gun and shoots a mini-plane robot thing. Kate looks at John and says 'what?' John replies, 'You remind me of my mother.'",9,3,5,28 September 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Could have been better
","Though I love the Terminator series, this is my least favorite of the four movies. Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes place about twelve years after the first movie. In this movie we find that John Connor (Edward Furlong) is living with foster parents because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) is in an asylum for trying to blow up a computer company.The graphics for this movie were far better than what the graphics for the first Terminator movie were. They ought to be, the budget was just over $100,000,000 compared to $6,500,000. That is quite a lot of difference.Anyway, even though this is my least favorite of all four movies I do have some favorite parts. But, before I list them I want to say that I could have gone a lot longer in my life with out seeing the naked asses of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. That said I think I can list my favorite scenes without ever having to reference those scenes again.My first favorite scene is when The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) walks into the road house to get clothes (oops, I'm referring to Arnold being naked). The Terminator takes out five or six bikers. One of the bikers pulls a knife and the Terminator disarms him and stabs the biker through the shoulder and pins him to the pool table. After the Terminator gets clothes and takes a motorcycle, the bartender come out to stop him with a shotgun. The Terminator disarms the bartender and takes his sunglasses, but leaves without further harm to anymore humans.My next favorite scene has to deal with when The Terminator and the T- 1000 and when they first find John Connor. The fight between the two terminators is pretty good. However, I like the chase scene through the storm canals better.The last scene I like is the scene when the T-1000 is defeated. It's a pretty drawn out elaborate fight scene that sees him fall into a vat of molten metal. Unfortunately for the Terminator, and John, that isn't the end of the movie. The Terminator must be destroyed, so he is lowered into the same vat of molten metal.I give this movie 7 stars out of 10. I didn't like how Sarah Connor was extremely butch and gung-ho, I understand it, but I didn't like it.",7,1,6,27 September 2013
Die Hard 2," Least Favorite
","Of the five Die Hard movies this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it is still a great movie. It is the return of one of the best action characters of the second half of the 20th Century... John McClane.Bruce Willis his role as John McClane, a police detective in the right place at the wrong time. This time he goes up against ex-military mercenaries in an airport. The mercenaries are trying to help in the escape of Ramon Esperanza, a general from the Republic of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for drug trafficking. McClane is, again, trying to save his wife who is on a plane in the skies above Dulles International Airport.Again the action starts out slow, but picks up as soon as John McClane gets involved in the action. He runs all over the airport in his quest to save his wife. John is thwarted several times along the way. One poignant scene is of McClane trying to avert a plane crash of a British Airways flight. He makes makeshift torches and runs out on the tarmac to signal to the plane that they are in danger. McClane is unsuccessful as the British Airways flight crashes into the runway killing all aboard. This shows the futility of the situation McClane finds himself in, but he doesn't give up. Quit just isn't in McClane's make-up.There are three parts of the movie I like the best. The first is when Richard Thornburg (played by William Atherton) is in the lavatory on the same plane as Holly McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia). Thornburg is in the lavatory on the phone giving an account of the terrorist situation to the news station he works for; Holly uses the tazer of the lady next to her and breaks into the lavatory where she zaps Thornburg.The next favorite scene is when McClane is trying to save the British Airways flight.My third favorite scene is when McClane figures out a specific piece of information and brings it to the attention of Captain Carmine Lorenzo (played by Dennis Franz), of the Dulles Airport Police Department. Lorenzo, in his inexhaustible fashion, doesn't believe McClane. McClane takes his evidence, a machine gun, and proceeds to empty the clip at Lorenzo. The bullets in the machine gun are blanks.Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars.",8,0,3,9 August 2013
Resident Evil," Excellent!
","For those of you that played the video game of Resident Evil I am sure you had a lot of fun playing. Unfortunately, I don't think I ever did play the game, at least not outside of an arcade version. Certainly not on Playstation or Sega or Nintendo. Yes, I am that old.Anyway, I love these movies. There is not any one part of any of these movies I don't like. If I could watch them all the time I would. Not because of the walking dead, but because Milla Yovovich is hot! It doesn't hurt that we see Milla almost nude a couple of times and there is a nipple glimpse; I won't call it a nipple slip, it was there on purpose.Anyway, like I said, there is literally nothing about any of the Resident Evil movies I don't like. However, as has become my custom in my reviews I have to list my all time favorite scenes. There are three I absolutely love.The first is the scene where the group of soldiers along with Alice (Milla Yovovich) and Spence (James Purefoy) attempt to turn off the Red Queen. Four of the soldiers enter a corridor which leads to the Red Queen's mainframe; after opening the door to her mainframe, the Red Queen closes the doors at both ends and traps the four soldiers. The Red Queen activates her defenses, in the form of lasers; first one that travels along one line, then one that moves up and down depending on if the soldier jumps or crouches, and finally a laser that turns into a grid and slices through the last soldier.I like a lot of the scenes where Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is the macho soldier. At one point she tells another character to 'blow her', hilarious. Several scenes into the movie after being bit, Rain is taunting the zombies by dripping blood from a wound in her hand down from pipes the group (Alice, Rain, Spence, Matt and Kaplan) is crawling along.The second scene I like is when the remaining members of the group, minus Kaplan, figure our that Spence is the one who released the T- Virus. Alice attempts to stop Spence's escape but he does so anyway, after a long speech how he did everything for Alice. In the end Alice doesn't buy anything that Spence says and he leaves. But Spence doesn't get far. He is soon killed by a Licker, a mutated monster that is hunting the survivors.The final scene I like is when the Licker attacks the train as the survivors are trying to make their way out of the Hive and the Mansion. The Licker claws it's way to the control end of the train, scratching Matt's arm in the process. When it reaches the controls of the train it attacks Kaplan and kills him, then goes after Alice, Matt and Rain. While Alice and Matt are fighting the Licker, Rain finally turns into a zombie. Now Alice and Matt have to fight the Licker and Rain. Alice traps the Licker's tongue with a pipe and stabs it with another pipe trapping it, yelling to Matt to open the doors to the undercarriage. Matt does this by shooting Rain in the forehead forcing her back into the button for the doors. The Licker falls through the door and from the electricity of the third rail catches fire. Alice closes the doors and cuts the tongue of the Licker letting it tumble away from the train.I said it before, and I'll say it again. I love these movies. I give this one 10 stars out of 10.",10,2,3,27 August 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Wow!
","I have one word to describe this movie... WOW! The story is not what I remember from the only time I read the book, but Hollywood being Hollywood, I am OK with the creative license for this movie. I am glad that Peter Jackson brought back Ian Holm as Old Bilbo and Elijah Wood as Frodo. Martin Freeman was a great choice for Young Bilbo, he was fantastic in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.I loved the landscape of the movie... I want to go to New Zealand now just to explore all the places that were used for this movie and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Can't wait for the next installment which will be out in December this year and the final installment due in December 2014.",10,0,3,15 July 2013
The Bourne Legacy," The Legacy of Bourne Continues... Beautiful!
","Of the four Bourne movies this is my second favorite. Only because it doesn't have Matt Damon or Julia Stiles. However, to make up for it not starring Matt Damon they brought in Jeremy Renner. The director and producers didn't bring Renner in as a replacement of Matt Damon. Matt Damon decided that if Paul Greengrass wasn't the director on this movie that he wouldn't be in it. Tony Gilroy directed Legacy, so the producers were forced to go in a different direction. They did so by bringing in a new character, Aaron Cross.Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, is similar to Jason Bourne. He is an agent of the CIA, black-ops kind of stuff. However, Aaron suffers from a learning disability. Well, at least his alter ego does.Again I have to list my favorite scenes. The first is Aaron removing the tracking beacon from his hip. He lures a wolf in and forces the beacon down the wolf's throat. The wolf takes off in one direction, Aaron in another. Unfortunately for the wolf, with the beacon in it's stomach, a guided missile blows it to smithereens. After this scene Aaron gets to a small airport and steals an airplane.My next favorite scene is when Aaron saves Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz) from being taken out by a CIA assassination squad. He kills each member of the squad and then helps Marta to burn her house down with the bodies still inside before escaping through the woods to an awaiting car.I of course like the chase scenes in Manila. They are separated only by a few minutes but they should considered a continuous chase scene. The first part is of Marta running away from Manila Police and Aaron running along the rooftops in order to catch her and save her. Which he does. The second part is when another assassin, only referred to as LARX #3, chases both Aaron and Marta through the streets of Manila on motorcycles.I would still choose Jason Bourne over Aaron Cross. I would also choose Julia Stiles over Rachel Weisz. Although, I do have to admit to having crushes on both Julia and Rachel. I can do that, can't I?Anyway, I give this 10 stars out of 10.",10,5,9,11 August 2013
Transformers," Pretty Good
","In 2007, Michael Bay brought to the silver screen a favorite cartoon series of mine from when I was a kid in a live action version of the Transformers. Many people have found fault in this movie and the two subsequent movies. I like these movies in their entirety.The first movie introduces the audience to the different characters. Who, men mostly, wouldn't have wanted to meet Bumblebee, Optimus Prime or even Megatron; I'm sure there are a few women out there that can say they would. We also meet Sam Witwiky (Shia LeBeouf), Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), Captain William Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Agent Simmons (JohnTurturro).It is hard to think of these movies as serious or action movies when there are so many jokes, comic relief scenes, and prat-falls. Shia LeBeouf is very good at doing prat-falls and having a that kind of background help him be able to play his character very well. However, I think that as you move from one movie to the next you start seeing Sam Witwiky become more mature.My first favorite scene is when Sam finds out that his car is in actuality a robot that can transform into a Camaro. At one point Sam tries to escape his car because he doesn't understand that the car is a friendly robot, not yet anyway. Sam grabs his mom's bike and tries to outrun his car. At one point he doesn't see a crack in the sidewalk; he ends up flipping over the handlebars right in front of Mikaela, who he has a crush on. It is only when the Camaro saves Sam and Mikaela from another robot that can change into a police car that they begin to trust him. Later Sam finds out that the cars name is Bumblebee.Another favorite scene is the awkward scene when Sam is looking for his Great-Grandfather's glasses. The other Autobots are anxious to get the glasses and they end up taking out the electricity to the entire neighborhood. Sam's parents come up to his room because they wanted to make sure he is OK. Sam's mom, Judy Witwicky (Julie White) asks him if the reason he had locked the door was because he was masturbating. It is after this conversation that Mikaela reveals herself hoping the conversation would stop being embarrassing... it doesn't.I like this movie because it brings to 'life' a favorite cartoon from my childhood. I try very hard to make up my own mind about movies and other entertainment without reading reviews of others. I have read articles describing what some reviewer or another had to say about this movie but I take it with a grain of salt. I like what I like. I try not to write a bad review if I can help it.That said, I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars. I don't know what could have made it better to get that last star.",9,4,5,17 September 2013
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Superb!
","Milla Yovovich is back as Alice in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. YES!!!!!!This movie is a continuation of the previous movie, almost as if no time has passed. Alice wakes up in the hospital with needles in her arms and head. Whatever they, The Unbrella Corporation, were pumping into her enhanced her abilities.Apocalypse revolves around the virus escaping The Hive because The Umbrella Corporation just wouldn't leave it alone. Umbrella opened up the Hive because they wanted to know what went wrong. The team that went into The Hive was attacked and left the doors open allowing the zombies out.The zombies escaping prompts a protocol for Umbrella where some of the top scientists and executives are evacuated before the civilians can be allowed to leave, assuming that they aren't infected. One of the scientists is Dr. Ashford, played by Jared Harris, who is taken away, but anxious to get his daughter out as well. The vehicles that Angie Ashford, played by Sophie Vavasseur, is in is hit by a semi truck. The two agents that were with Angie appear to be dead, while we see Angie move her fingers telling the audience that she is alive.Using his computer, Dr. Ashford locates his daughter, but there is evidence of zombies in the area. Therefore, Dr. Ashford looks for recruits to help save Angie.Before we get to this point though, we meet Terri Morrales, Jill Valentine, L.J., Carlos Olivera, and Sgt. Peyton Wells. It is a combination of these characters and Alice that eventually locate Angie and bring her to safety.My three favorite scenes are pretty cool, two of them have Alice fighting the creature from the Nemesis Program.The first scene is when Alice and Nemesis fight for the first time. The best part of the scene is when Alice escapes down a trash shoot in a police precinct. While falling down the shoot one of Alice's fingers gets caught on some fencing and either brakes or dislocates. Nemesis fire a rocket down the shoot, but Alice escapes anyway. The end of the scene is when Alice fixes her finger.The second scene I liked was the scene when the rescuers get to the school that Angie has taken refuge in. As they search the school for Angie, Terri is attacked by several children who have been turned into zombies. L.J. is attacked by a zombie, but Carlos saves him. Jill locates Angie and tries to reconnect with the others from her group. Jill takes Angie through the Cafeteria not knowing that there are zombie dogs loose in the school. They get trapped in the kitchen and Jill eventually turns all the gas burners of every stove on intending to blow up the kitchen with the dogs inside. The book of matches Jill throws into the kitchen fails to set the gas off, but Alice arrives and throws a lit cigarette in... KABOOM!The third scene I liked was the final fight scene between Alice and Nemesis. Umbrella wants to see who is better. Between the two the fight is pretty evenly matched. Alice, however, impales Nemesis on a piece of steel. Alice eventually realizes that Nemesis is Matt, the only other survivor of the battle in The Hive from the first movie.I won't give away the ending of the movie. Suffice it to say that Alice 'survives' yet again. If that is too much of a spoiler alert, I apologize, but you would have figured that out if you looked at the cast for the next movie in this series. Hint, Alice is the central character for the movies, she survives through the end of the fifth movie... and beyond.I give this movie 9 Stars out of 10. The fight scenes are better and more elaborate. Milla Yovovich is sexy as hell, even as a zombie killing machine. Sienna Guillory is another sexy zombie killing machine and is perfect as Jill Valentine. Oded Fehr is another great casting choice for Carlos.",9,2,2,29 August 2013
Clash of the Titans," Pretty Good!
","Gemma Arterton also starred in another fantasy movie in 2010... that being Clash of the Titans. In Prince of Persia she played a Princess who was charged with a sacred mission by the gods. In Clash of the Titans she plays Io, Io in Clash of the Titans is the protector of Perseus. Io, according to the movie, rebuffed the advances of an unknown god and was cursed with immortality.Perseus (Sam Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Danae (Tine Stapelfeldt). Danae was tricked by Zeus as he was disguised as Danae's husband, Calibos (Jason Flemyng). Calibos is enraged that his wife is impregnated by Zeus and kills Danae and her child... well he tries to kill the child. Perseus survives. Calibos is hit with a lightning bolt as he attempts to toss Danae's casket into the sea. The lightning bolt disfigures him.I know I say this a lot, and I mean it a lot, I really like this movie. Although, the creative license that the writers have utilized in creating Clash of the Titans has been pretty extreme. Don't believe me. Look up Io or Perseus or any of the other characters online. The way their lives are depicted in Clash of the Titans is pretty different than what the ancient Greeks believed. Fortunately for the writers, these characters are made up... so they can use as much creative license as they was in order to make the kind of movie they want.I liked a lot of the fighting scenes. Especially the scene when Perseus and his fellow travelers are fighting Medusa. Perseus is successful in chopping her head off which was his mission to begin with. However, it cost him his companions... including Io, who he had begun to fall in love with. And the bitch of it was... she loved him also.Because I love mythology and everything that goes along with it I loved this movie. It didn't hurt that Gemma Arterton was in it... she is quite beautiful. I give this movie 10 stars out of 10",10,3,6,5 January 2014
Taken," Pure Genius
","Liam Neeson is one of my all time favorite actors. I have many of his movies, I would like to have them all. I even have Krull, which will be reviewed sometime in the future.The actors in Taken are some of my favorites as well; Famke Jensen and Maggie Grace are just two of them. I thought the acting by these two and Neeson were phenomenal. Some of the best acting I have ever seen.The script was awesome. The subject matter was pretty daring. The action itself was great. The only negative that I saw was when Liam Neeson was running. But I can't fault him too much, I don't run well either. But enough of that.I give Taken 10 stars out of 10. From start to finish Taken is just a great movie.Liking this movie as much as I did I have a hard time picking three of my favorites scenes. But The three that pop into my mind right now are some of the best of the movie.The first scene is a difficult scene to watch. It's the scene where Amanda (Katie Cassidy) and Kim (Maggie Grace) are kidnapped from Amanda's cousin's apartment in Paris. Kim is talking on the phone with her father, Brian Mills (Liam Neeson). She sees through a window that a couple of guys have grabbed Amanda and she relays this to Brian. Brian tells Kim to go to the next room and hide under the bed. Brian talks to Kim calmly and explains what is going to happen and what he wants her to do. Kim is taken, but as she is being taken from the room she yells out things she sees. When everything is quiet Brian hears someone pick up the cell phone and hears breathing. Brian explains 'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for, I will find you, and I will kill you.' The response is 'Good Luck'What a great scene. Even if it was difficult to watch.The next scene I like is when Brian finds out where the girls were taken to in order to get them hooked on drugs and turned into prostitutes. He enters the house on the pretense that he is part of the local police force and he is now in charge of collecting the 'shake-down' money for not putting a stop to illegal activities. At the end of the conversation Brian asks the five men in the room to translate a phrase he has on a piece of paper, it's in Albanian. The phrase is translated and said out loud by one of the men, who says 'Good Luck.' At that moment, Brian realizes that that man was the one he talked to on the cell phone that his daughter had. That is when he takes those five men out, along with all the other members of the gang that are in the house. Unfortunately, Brian finds Amanda in one of the upstairs rooms... dead from an apparent drug overdose. Then he finds one of the men alive and tortures him by strapping him to a metal chair and hooking up what looks like jumper cables to the light switch and turns it on. When Brian gets the information he wants, he turns the switch on and leaves it on walking out of the house.Awesome sequence of scenes. It shows that a father will do almost anything to find and protect his children. That being said, the sequence of scenes that lead to Brian rescuing his daughter says that he will do everything possible to save Kim. That is an awesome sequence.Brian Finds out that his daughter is going to be sold because she is a virgin. He finds out through a man he thought he was a friend that the man he needs is St-Clair and where to find him. Brian enters St-Clair's house and finds the auction rooms in the basement. He gets one of the buys to buy his daughter in order to save her. But Brian gets captured and sentenced to death by St-Clair. Brian escapes and kills St-Clair. He then follows after Kim and her 'owners' in order to rescue her. He kills everyone on board the boat his daughter has been taken aboard. When he finds Kim she is being held at knife point by Sheik Raman (Nabil Massad). Raman attempts to negotiate, but Brian is in no mood to negotiate, so he puts a bullet through his forehead.There are other scenes I could have talked about. Like when Lenore (Famke Jensen) tries to browbeat Brian into signing the permission form for Kim to go to Paris because she is under 18. Or the scene when Brian goes to his so called friend, Jean-Claude (Olivier Rabourdin), in Paris by going to his apartment and shoots Jean-Claude's wife... in the arm. Or I could have described the scene where Brian saves Sheerah (Holly Valance) from some crazed fan who attempts to stab her after a concert.Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen wrote one hell of a great movie. And Director Pierre Morel did a phenomenal job creating one of my favorite movies.",10,3,4,8 November 2013
Jack Reacher," Just saw Jack Reacher
","Just saw Jack Reacher. LOVED IT! I thought it was great. There was a lot of action, but it had some great comic relief. Jack Reacher's interaction with everyone bordered heavily on comic relief. There is a scene when Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is in his hotel room with Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) and she asks him to put his shirt on, but he says he only has one. Several minutes later he says it's late and they should get some sleep, Helen mistaken thinks that he is suggesting they sleep together and then realizes her mistake. The whole interaction is very funny but delivered in a straight faced manner, at least on the part of Jack Reacher. Many of Jack Reacher's other encounters throughout the movie are along the same lines as this. The uncomfortable interactions between Reacher and Sandy, played by Alexia Fast, are particularly amusing as all he wants is information and she keeps offering herself to him. After Sandy is killed and Helen is kidnapped the comic relief is done.All this talk about comic relief by no means refers to the first ten minutes of the movie. A sniper sets up across the river from PNC Park in Pittsburgh and kills six people. The act is believed to be done by James Barr, played by Joseph Sikora, a former Army Sniper. He is arrested and in interrogation he writes one thing... Find Jack Reacher! When Reacher arrives in Pittsburgh Barr has been beaten to the point of being in a coma.That is all I will say about this movie as far as the plot. I give this a vote of 9 out of 10. Tom Cruise should think of making the other Jack Reacher books into movies.",9,13,19,15 July 2013
The Da Vinci Code," A Great Suspense Thriller
","There are few movies or books that are as controversial as this one, and this one doesn't even have nudity or much swearing in it. Dan Brown did a wonderful job weaving a fictional story with historical facts to tell the story of The Da Vinci Code. Some of the historical facts are true, some of them have been interpreted in such a way in order to tell the story. The Da Vinci Code is of course a novel and now a movie.I love this movie because it has suspense, murder, mystery and history. I love the historical twists that have been added in order to tell this story. I love how Dan Brown tries to tell the story by showing that Jesus could have been married and had children, or at least one child, and that that child survived to adulthood and had children and so on. It also tells of the story that that child's bloodline, Jesus's bloodline, survived to the present day.The first scene I like is the scene where Silas (Paul Bettany) hunts down Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) and kills him. The reason I like this scene is because after Silas shoots Sauniere, Sauniere leaves a message that only Robert Landon (Tom Hanks) could decipher. Landon does so with the help of Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou).My next favorite scene is when Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) is trying to get the Shadow Council to give money to pay for the information that would lead to the Holy Grail. It is surprising that Aringarosa and his fellow council members are aware of what the grail actually is, Mary Magdalene. Aringarosa vows that once he gets the location of the grail he will destroy all documents as well as the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene.My most favorite scene is when the heir of Jesus is revealed to the audience as Sophie herself. I like this scene because it shows her lineage and those of the group that has protected her line for over a thousand years, including the man she thought of as her grandfather, Jacques Sauniere.I know this movie and the corresponding book has drawn the criticism of many critics because it calls into question the divinity of Jesus. I ask, though, why couldn't Jesus have had a wife and a child and still be divine?I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars.",10,1,2,4 September 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Amazingly well done!
","I had a friend who worked at a movie theater during the releases of the first two Harry Potter movies who kept getting asked if he was hired as a look-alike for Harry Potter. He hated it. But that is not to say that he didn't like the movies, or at least the ones I know he watched.Anyway, I loved these movies. I liked how we got to watch the characters grow. I mean why not, there were 8 movies covering 7 years of growth. We got to see the three main characters go from awkward pre-teens to very talented and strong adults.In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone we meet all the characters. Well, the most important characters for the whole series and many others that played big part throughout. We meet other important characters in later movies that play important parts.The graphics are great. I especially like when some of the different characters are shown flying broom sticks. I thought that having Hagrid driving a flying motorcycle with a sidecar was a nice touch. Speaking of Hagrid, I liked how the Special Effects Department made a 6'1' actor, Robbie Coltrane look 8'6'.My favorite scenes may not be what you think they should be. I like the big scenes, but my favorite scenes are not the big scenes.The first scene I liked was when Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and the Dursleys go to the zoo. Harry's cousin, Dudley (Harry Melling), is celebrating his birthday. Harry, Dudley, Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) are in the reptile house at the zoo. They are looking at a Burmese Python and Dudley wants it to move. Uncle Vernon knocks on the glass to try to get it to move, Harry yells that its asleep. After the others leave, Harry begins talking to the snake... and it understands him. Dudley turns around and sees that the snake is moving. He runs over and pushes Harry out of the way. In anger, Harry makes the glass disappear and Dudley falls in. The python escapes, but Dudley is stuck inside the python's exhibit. Serves him right!The next scene I liked was the scene of the first Quiddich Match Harry was ever in. I won't describe the scene in detail, but I will tell you that it is amazing to watch. The best part is when Harry catches the Golden Snitch to win the match. He does so by catching it in his mouth.The third scene I like is chess game Harry, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) play in order to stop Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) from getting the Sorcerer's Stone. It's a giant chess game in which the three young wizards have to play as pieces. There is a scene earlier in the movie when we see Harry and Ron playing Wizard Chess and this is exactly like that only bigger.Of course I am going to give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 10 stars out of 10. I liked everything about this movie.",10,0,1,8 October 2013
Thor," Great movie! Great special effects!
","I finally got to watch the movie Thor with Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth. While I was never into comic books growing up I do like how the Marvel comics have been brought to life over the last few years. Being a historian and one that likes the different cultures of the ancient world, I liked how the Norse Gods were interpreted in this movie. According to the movie there are nine realms, Earth being one, and Asgard being another. The Norse Gods, as we know them, are protectors, of a sort, several hundred years ago these gods fought a war and won, protecting the other eight realms from Jötunheim, a frozen planet, whose inhabitants want what all evil wants, control. I won't give the whole plot away, IMDb has done that already, all I will say is watch it. It's pretty good. Special effects are great. Anthony Hopkins makes a great Odin. Hemsworth is a great Thor. Can't wait for the sequel to come out this November.",8,0,1,15 July 2013
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Perfect!
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second installment of J.K. Rawlings phenomenally great series that has been adapted into a movie. The series is so great in my opinion that I will go ahead and post right now that all of them get a score of 10 stars out of 10. Don't worry, I'll remind you of the scores for each of the next 6 movies.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets builds on the first movie. After all, the movies are supposed to follow Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) as they attend school at Hogwarts. In this movie we meet Guilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Lockhart is full of himself and is an inept wizard; it's amazing he has made it as far as he has in life and being so inept.As I did for Sorcerer's Stone in giving my favorite scene I won't describe the big scenes, though they are some of my favorites. However, I have other scenes that I like that will be listed below.The first scene I liked was when Ron and his twin brothers, Fred (James Phelps) and George (Oliver Phelps), come to Surrey, England to rescue Harry. Harry has been put on lock down in the Dursley house because of something he didn't do. Dobby (Toby Jones) the House Elf has taken it upon himself to save Harry Potter from a plot against him. Dobby drops a cake on Uncle Vernon's boss's wife's head. When Ron, Fred and George come to rescue Harry they do so in a flying car. When they get to the Weasley home we meet Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) and Molly Weasley (Julie Walters), parents to Ron, Fred and George. We also meet Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright).The second scene I like was the dueling scene between Harry and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). They are supposed to only disarm each other, but Malfoy cheats (shocker!). Harry retaliates, but Malfoy comes back with a spell that produces a snake. Harry talks to the snake trying to convince it to not attack another student, this shocks everyone because talking to snakes is not a common gift.The next scene is one of the funniest scenes. It's when Harry and Ron 'accompany' Lockhart into the Chamber of Secrets to save Ginny. They see a snake skin on the ground and Lockhart faints. However, this is a ploy in order to steal Ron's wand. Lockhart attempts to erase Harry's memories, but Ron's wand was broken near the beginning of the movie and he never replaced it. The spell Lockhart tries to use backfires and causes a cave-in, it also causes Lockhart to lose all of his memories.I already scored this movie, how would you score it?",10,1,2,8 October 2013
Die Hard," Classic
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Bruce Willis is amazing as John McClane. Alan Rickman is perfect as the quintessential bad guy as Hans Gruber. These two characters facing off makes for a perfect mixture, adding in the roles of Holly Genero McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia), Sgt. Al Powell (played by Reginald VelJohnson) and Karl (played by Alexander Godunov).I watch this movie at least once a year because, even though it was released 25 years ago, it is a classic. This is the one that started the Die Hard franchise. And has continued to be built on since the franchise is now up to five movies.The movie is fairly slow until Gruber and his cohorts take the 40 story Nakatomi tower and everyone inside hostage. This includes John McClane and his estranged wife, Holly; John is a NYPD detective on vacation visiting his wife and children for Christmas. When Gruber and company take charge John is thrust into saving the day and taking out the terrorists. Amazingly, he does this all while barefoot.This movie made Bruce Willis's career. Without this movie in his portfolio there is no telling where he would be today. On the other hand, without Bruce Willis there is no telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have been. Alan Rickman also made the perfect bad guy, and there is no telling how well this movie would have done with someone else in that role.",10,3,3,8 August 2013
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Pretty Good
","I liked this Transformers movie better than the first movie. Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen has a better plot line than Transformers, regardless of what other people say. There are actually two plot lines in this one; one where Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) and Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) delve deeper into their relationship and the other the continued civil war between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Yeah I know, not the best combination of plot lines, especially for a Sci-Fi movie.In Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen we learn more about what started the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons. A long time ago Optimus Primes ancestors visited Earth in order to harvest energon, which comes from the sun, any sun. However, when it was discovered that there was life on Earth, the Primes decided to leave Earth alone and find a new source for energon. Unfortunately, one of the Primes refused to accept this decision and tried to harvest the sun anyway. The other Primes defeated the one, forever after known as the Fallen, and to prevent him from ever turning on the machine again they decided to hide the matrix. The matrix is pure energon and it is what powers the machine that would harvest the sun. To hide the matrix the remaining Primes sacrificed themselves and entombed it in a mountain cave.Yeah, I know. It's called Science Fiction for a reason.Now the parts of this movie I like have a lot to do with Sam Witwicky. During the first half hour of the movie he finds a shard from the cube that was destroyed in the first movie stuck to the shirt he was wearing at the time. He kept it as a souvenir. He gives the shard to Mikaela for safe keeping before going off to college. When he gets to college he finds out that his roommate is an alien robot paparazzi wannabe, but decides to go with the flow... especially since he can't get another room assignment. Sam and his flatmates go to a party where Sam meets Alice (Isabel Lucas). Isabel is extremely interested in Sam, apparently. Bumblebee, in Camaro form, comes to warn Sam that the Decepticons have located the remains of Megatron and another piece of the Cube. Sam refuses to get involved. The next day in an Astronomy class Sam reads his text book in less than a minute and attempts to correct his professor... he is asked to leave. Sam figures out that when he touched the shard from his shirt the information was somehow transferred to him. Also maybe some superhuman abilities.Again, I know. It's Sci-Fi.Another part of this that I like the take charge side of Sam that emerges as he tries to figure out where the matrix is. He enlists the help of his girlfriend, Mikaela, even though she is upset that she caught him making out with Alice. Fortunately for Sam, Alice turned out to be a robot that could change into human form. I think Mikaela forgave Sam for that indiscretion. Sam also enlists the help of his roommate, Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez), and former Agent, Simmons (John Turturro). Together, with the help of Bumblebee and a couple of other Autobots and a turn-coat Decepticon they figure out how to read the symbols that Sam keeps seeing. They end up going to The Smithsonian Air & Space Museum near Washington, D.C. to take to Jetfire (Mark Ryan). Jetfire turns out to be a reformed Decepticon and helps Sam and the others by transporting them all to Egypt.The next scene I like is when Sam is trying to get to Optimus Prime to revive him. First he has to get his parents to safety and tells them to take Mikaela, but his dad, Ron Witwicky (Kevin Dunn), tries to stop Sam from going. Sam's mom, Judy Witwicky (Julie White), tells Ron that he has to let him go. Mikaela refuses to leave Sam, so they run to Optimus. Along the way they are picked up by Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and his team. While they make a run for it Sam runs in the direction of Optimus as everyone else goes a different direction. As he is running a Decepticon is shooting at him, one of the shots hits the ground near him and blows him off course, and apparently when he hits the ground he is dead. As he is lying there with a medic trying to revive him, with Mikaela crying over him, Sam has an out-of-body experience where he takes with the Primeval Primes (Say that 10 times fast!). The Primes tell him that he has the ability to revive Optimus, he always had it. At that point he wakes up. It's not all of this that I like, technically it is, but what I really liked was way back at the beginning of the movie Mikaela was trying to get Sam to say 'I Love You', but he wouldn't; as he is laying there, apparently dead, she says it to him, then he wakes up his first words are 'You said it first.' Sucker! A lot that I am not describing is pretty damn funny, so I would suggest watching it. You know some critics don't like Michael Bay because he puts beautiful women, sometimes too many, in his movies. I just say that that is our society. I bet you the same critics, mostly women, who complained about the beautiful women in these three movies had no complaints about Twilight with Robert Pattinson or when Taylor Lautner was walking around with his shirt off. Hypocrites!Anyway, I give this a 9 out of 10 stars. I don't know what could have made it better.",9,6,9,19 September 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Just as Good as the Original!
","John McClane is back and better than ever. He is back in New York and currently on suspension. That is until Simon plays his game.Simon has McClane and Zeus Carver traipsing all over New York playing little games. McClane and Carver play along until McClane figures out that everything that Simon is putting them through is nothing but a wild goose chase.Simon turns out to be Simon Gruber, brother to Hans Gruber. Hans as you remember was killed by McClane in Calafornia several years before. Simon is bent on revenge... and gets pretty damn close.McClane does what he does best. He figures what Simon is really up to... the same thing that Hans was up to in California. Basically it's a heist, but the way everything is done is what makes the story so great.Bruce Willis brings his best to this role, as he has done twice before. I still maintain that if Willis had not been cast in this role there is not telling how successful the Die Hard franchise would have done. Bruce Willis IS John McClane.Jeremy Irons brings a different aspect to the story as Simon. The revenge angle has been done before but with the twist of the heist is a bit different. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver was a great move. Imagining someone else in any of these roles is unimaginable. The pace for this movie from beginning to end is fast, barely letting up for a breather.I give this 10 stars out of 10.",10,0,0,9 August 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of this Trilogy!
","Well, this is a continuation of the previous movie, Anakin is still portrayed as a whining brat. At least at the beginning. At the end his temper tantrum is almost epic.In this installment of Star Wars, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) are married and are expecting a child. Actually two children. They are keeping their relationship secret, as well as, who the father of Padme's children are.The graphics are very good. I especially liked the event that Chancellor Palpetine (Ian McDiarmid) was attending when Anakin went to meet with him. Many of the battle scenes are pretty cool. I thought it was great that Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) was brought into the movie. The fight between Yoda (Frank Oz) and Emperor Palpetine was amazing, even though Yoda lost.There are many scenes I liked, some of them I have already mentioned. But I will describe at least three more.The first scene I liked was the scene in which Anakin and Obi-Wan are sent to rescue Chancellor Palpetine. Palpetine was kidnapped by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and General Grievous (Matthew Wood). Anakin and Obi-Wan confront Dooku. Obi-Wan is knocked unconscious. Anakin cuts off Dooku's arms at about the elbow. Dooku is helpless and on his knees. Anakin has both his and Dooku's lightsabers crossed in front of Dooku's neck. Palpatine eggs Anakin on to execute Dooku, and Anakin does. Anakin immediately regrets his action.The next scene I like is the fight scene between Obi-Wan and Grievous. Some of it is funny, especially when Obi-Wan kicks Grievous. This was a stupid move since Grievous is a cyborg(?). In the end Obi-Wan succeeds in defeating Grievous by shooting him in the chest and destroying his heart. Yes, Grievous had a heart.The third scene I liked was the fight scene between Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and Palpatine. Palpatine reveals that he is well versed in the Jedi arts. Anakin comes in and attempts to help Windu bring Palpatine under arrest, but ends up helping Palpatine defeat Windu. This is the act that causes Anakin to become Darth Vader, but he needs to complete one task for Palpatine... Kill all Jedi in the Jedi Temple, including younglings. It would be this act of killing younglings that would kill the relationship between Anakin and Padme.I give Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith 10 stars out of 10. What do you think?",10,2,7,7 October 2013
Halloween," I LOVE this movie!
","I love this movie! Halloween is the best horror movie made in the last 35 years. Yes, I said 35 years! If you don't believe me watch it and see for yourself. I have seen this movie at least 20 or 30 times. I won't exaggerate, because there is no need to.John Carpenter and Debra Hill took a budget of $325,000 and created a franchise that has scared movie goers for 35 years. The franchise estimated budget, according to different sources, is somewhere around $80,325,000; this covers all ten movies, including the two Rob Zombie versions. The total gross income for all ten movies is over $366,000,000.Over 115,000 IMDb.com users have voted that puts Halloween at 7.9 stars out of 10. I of course believe that this is one of the scariest movies ever made and give it 10 stars. John Carpenter used many different tricks of lighting and shadow in order to create this masterpiece. He used many tricks of psychology in order to feed the movie goers fears of what might happen next. The tricks that Carpenter used are so simple.As I said before I have seen Halloween many, many times. So yes, I know what happens. But, knowing something is going to happen and the anticipation of it happening is enough to make anybody jump even just a little.I love Halloween from beginning to end. But I will describe my three favorite scenes from the movie.The first scene I liked is when Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) are driving up to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. They are talking as they drive up to the hospital and all of a sudden they see several patients wandering around in a storm. Dr. Loomis orders Chambers to drive up to the gate, he gets out of the car to inspect the gate house. As Loomis does this, one of the patients climbs on top of the car and then forces Chambers out. The patient, later determined to be Michael Myers (Tony Moran), drives off.The second of my favorite scenes is one that has been talked about before on other reviews. It's the scene where Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes) is going to pick up her boyfriend. She goes out to her car and tries to get in, but the door is locked. She runs back into the house to get her keys and comes back and gets into the car... without using the keys to unlock the door. She goes to put the key in the ignition and notices the windows are fogged up. As she tries to wipe off the condensation she is attacked by Michael Myers, wearing his now famous mask. Michael eventually cuts Annie's throat. Of course, the fact that her throat is cut is not why I like this scene. I like this scene because Annie doesn't even pay attention to what she is doing, but a real movie fan would have picked up on the fact that she couldn't get into the car and then about 30 seconds later she can.Before I describe my third favorite scene I want to tell you about my favorite line. Dr. Loomis explains 'I met him, fifteen years ago; I was told there was nothing left; No reason, no conscience, no understanding; and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes... the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.'The third scene I liked is when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) goes to the Wallace house to see what is keeping Annie. She walks in and searches the house, but doesn't find anyone until she gets to an upstairs bedroom. When she enters the bedroom she finds her friends Annie, Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Lynda's boyfriend, Bob Sims (John Michael Graham) have been killed. She runs from the Wallace house to the Doyle house, across the street, in an attempt to call the police. Laurie is pursued by Micheal and then the real fun begins. Michael pursues Laurie several times; I say 'several times' because Laurie stabs him with knitting needles and a few other items, but he gets up after each. It is only after Dr. Loomis shoots Michael several times that he seems to be stopped.Yes, I know, I gave away the ending of the movie. There aren't too many ways that someone could have never seen Halloween. Giving away the ending of a movie that is over 30 years old is not a bad thing. Like I said before it is the way the scenes are set up that make the movie anyway. The psychology of fear that John Carpenter used to scare everyone.I already gave this movie 10 stars out of 10. What did you think?",10,0,2,1 November 2013
Despicable Me," Masterpiece
","How could anyone not love Despicable Me? I couldn't stop laughing long enough to actually watch the movie and understand the plot. But I did.I am by far not a Steve Carell fan, but I am learning to love his movies. I liked Evan Almighty and 40 Year Old Virgin, they were pretty funny. Unfortunately, and I am probably in the minority, I never could get into The Office.Anyway, I loved this movie. There aren't any parts of this movie I didn't like. I thought the animation was awesome. The script was great. The voice overs were exceptional.The best part of the whole movie is... the minions. How could you not love these guys? I thought it was hilarious when the minion who floated out of the skylight kept showing back up. Or the three that went to the store dressed as a mother, father and baby to get a unicorn for Agnes (Elsie Fisher).My favorite scene of the whole movie has to be when Gru (Steve Carell) gets talked into stopping at the amusement park. I couldn't stop laughing. The best part of that whole scene is when the three girls are trying to knock over the spaceship, but can't. The Carnival Barker (Jack McBrayer) makes condescending comments about how they can't knock over the ship. Gru takes it upon himself to win the top prize... a unicorn bigger than Agnes. Gru pulls out what I can only describe as a laser pulse cannon and fires at the spaceship. He basically disintegrates the whole booth and says, 'Knocked Oooover!' Awesome!I can't even pick any other scene I liked because I liked them all. Well, I didn't like the end. You know where the credits start rolling and you have to get out of the seat or turn off the DVD player. That was my least favorite part of the whole movie.I give this 10 out of 10 stars.",10,0,0,20 September 2013
Taken 2," Almost as good as the first...
","Usually the second movie in a series is not as good as the first, but Taken 2 is almost as good as the first. Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, who wrote Taken, followed up with a spectacular sequel. Set in Istanbul the families of the men that Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) killed in Paris have come calling for revenge. The tagline on the DVD I have says 'First they took his daughter, now they are coming for him.'Bryan is working as a body guard in Istanbul and has invited his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), and his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Jensen), to join him as a get away for a few days once his work is complete. The families of the men Bryan killed in Paris are trying to track where Bryan and his family will be... they find him. On the morning of the first full day Kim and Lenore are in Istanbul the men attack, but they only get Bryan and Lenore. Kim had stayed at the hotel to swim in the pool and relax, claiming jet lag.Just like in Taken there is almost nothing about this movie I don't like. However, in Taken 2 there is a scene where Bryan and Kim are racing through the streets of Istanbul in order to get to the U.S. Embassy. Bryan is yelling at Kim to drive faster. Kim is yelling back that she can't. The thing that I didn't like is that at every turn Kim whines that she 'can't'. But as we see she certainly can.When you like the whole movie it is difficult to choose which scenes you like and want to talk about. But I'll try.There is a series of scenes that I like that have to deal with when Bryan and Lenore are taken. Bryan tries to get Lenore to safety by telling her how to get back to the hotel, but that doesn't work and she is captured. Before Bryan finds out that Lenore gets captured he is ambushed and fights about five or six different guys, maybe more. Bryan finds one of the guys guns and points it at one of them threatening to 'blow his brains out'. Another guy then shoots his 'friend' three times. That is when Lenore is brought to the courtyard and Bryan calls Kim. Bryan tells Kim what is going to happen and what he wants her to do. The next scene I like is the car chase Bryan and Kim lead through the streets of Istanbul, despite Kim whining most of the time. The aggressiveness that is required to avoid not only the guys trying to kidnap them, but also to avoid the police is pretty cool. At one point during the chase Kim and Bryan are driving through a train yard; they dodge a train but one of the bad guys trucks isn't so lucky. Just after this Kim and Bryan make it to the Embassy, though they have to drive through a hale of gun fire by U.S. Embassy guards. Bryan calls his friend, Sam (Leland Orser), to make sure they are safe.The final scene I liked is when Bryan goes after the rest of the group who have Lenore. Bryan now knows that the man in charge is the father, Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija), of the man he electrocuted in Paris. When Bryan and Lenore had been taken earlier that morning, Bryan paid attention to sounds and turns in the road. He followed those sounds and turns until it lead him to the house Lenore was being held in. Once he gets there... all hell breaks loose. Bryan kills every last one of the men in the house and tracks down Murad and another man, who have left the house with Lenore. Bryan tracks them to a bath house. After killing the last man, Bryan decides to leave Murad alive if he would just go home and live the rest of his life caring for his remaining sons. Murad has other plans and still tries to kill Bryan. Bryan shoves Murad's head into a coat-hook which penetrates the base of his skull.Taken 2 is a great movie, almost as good as the original. Even though I say that sequels are almost never as good as the first and that I gave Taken 10 stars out of 10, I also give Taken 2 10 stars out of 10.",10,1,3,10 November 2013
Tombstone," Amazing!
","If I were to list my all time favorite Westerns, Tombstone would definitely be at the top. I even love the director's cut that was release not to long ago that explained some missing pieces. Some critics have compared Tombstone with Wyatt Earp, which came out a year later. I believe this is an unfair comparison since Tombstone dealt with the events that happened in Tombstone, AZ and Wyatt Earp spanned more of Wyatt Earp's life before Tombstone, his life in Tombstone, and a little of his life after Tombstone.I love this movie because everything was made to look authentic. The facial hair was real, which is awesome... no fake hair on these guys faces. There is a scene with a thunderstorm that roles in and... it's real.One of my favorite scenes is when Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Morgan Earp (Bill Paxton), and Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) first meet Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). In this scene Wyatt is dealing a faro game and he has just signed an autograph for a patron. Curly Bill grabs the autograph out of the man's hand and reads it. Ike jumps in and says that 'law don't go round here.' Wyatt informs him that he is retired. Johnny Ringo joins the conversation by looking at Doc Holliday and saying that he must be Doc Holliday. An exchange between the two ensues that could have gone wrong when Ringo draws his gun and begins spinning it. However, Doc uses a cup to diffuse the situation by spinning it in the same manner Ringo did.Another favorite scene is when Ike and Frank Stilwell (Thomas Arana) follow Wyatt and the rest of his family to Tucson to take Morgan's body to California. Ike and Frank are tasked to kill Wyatt and Virgil. Before they can complete their task Wyatt kills Frank. Wyatt walks up to a cowering Ike and takes his spur and cuts him at the corner of the mouth. Wyatt informs Ike that he is now a U.S. Marshall and that he is going to hunt down every Cowboy and kill them.The scene at the OK Corral is amazing. It is as close to what really happened as the film could get it without going back to October 26, 1881. I won't describe it because I wouldn't be able to do it justice and I want you to watch the movie if you haven't or again if you have.There are other scenes I liked as well. The movie itself is very good. This would have to be my absolute favorite Western movie of all time. I like this movie so much that I have remembered many of the various lines. Many of the lines Val Kilmer spoke as Doc Holliday are great, including, 'I'm your Huckleberry'.I give this 10 stars out of 10. I love this movie. I also recently read an article that told a story in which the original director was let go from this movie. A new director was hired and the production company whittled the script down significantly. Kurt Russell is also responsible for rallying the other actors and crew to finish the movie, said the same article.",10,0,1,17 September 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Best of the Best!
","This is perhaps my favorite Die Hard movie. Mainly because it has John McClane trying to rebuild a relationship with his children... one at a time. In this case he is trying to have a relationship with his daughter, Lucy.Just like the other three movies the pace starts out slowly but after about ten or fifteen minutes the action picks up. It's not so fast paced that you miss anything. Or that the movie is faster than the other movies. The pace of these movies is one element that makes them so enjoyable for me.Bruce Willis reprises his role as John McClane. Lucy is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Joining in the fun is Justin Long who plays Matthew Farrell; Timothy Olyphant playing the role of Thomas Gabriel, the bad guy.If you remember, in the first movie John had to thwart the efforts of Hans Gruber in stealing money from a corporation by taking over a building and the occupants of the building became his hostages. In the second, John thwarted the efforts of a paramilitary unit from helping in the escape of a drug lord while holding an airport hostage as well as the many airplanes in the skies above. In the third movie, John must thwart the efforts of Simon Krige, better known as Hans Grubers baby brother, from stealing millions of dollars worth of gold.In this movie, John must stop Thomas Gabriel from stealing the entire countries wealth. Gabriel tries to do this by forcing what is known as a 'fire sale'. A 'fire sale' is where a hacker or a group of hackers take over three or more of the countries infrastructures. This can be banks, electricity, natural gas, or some other modern necessity.Eventually, Lucy is kidnapped, so the task for john becomes one in which he must rescue her. Matthew Farrell helps John along the way, but eventually is captured as well. John comes in in the nick-of-time to save them both and kills the bad guys. But the way he kills Gabriel is probably the best I have seen in a long time.I give this a 10 out of 10 stars.",10,2,5,11 August 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Excellent!
","Sequels have a hard time even equaling the success of their predecessor, but The Hunger Games: Catching Fire does give the first movie in this series a real run for supremacy. Why? The story just keeps building upon itself, with many twists and turns that keep the viewer kept off guard the way through. If you have read the books, you know what is going to happen, but bringing the book to life is what amazes me.Suzanne Collins wrote an amazing book, that was turned into a first rate script by screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt. The cast brings to life the characters that Suzanne Collins created for her dystopian world. Donald Sutherland plays President Snow very well in both movies, in many ways he is the perfect villain. Jennifer Lawrence does a wonderful job bring to life Katniss Everdeen, and has run the gamut of emotions in both movies; in every sense she is the perfect heroine.Because this movie has only been in the theaters for approximately 3 days at the time of this writing I won't describe in detail big amounts of scenes. I would like to encourage you to watch the movie as soon as possible. I will give my rating now though of 10 stars out of 10; really just to get it out of the way.I will tell you three things I liked about the film.First, I liked the emotional roller coaster that each character had to travel over the course of this film. Each character, from Katniss, Peeta Malark (Josh Hutcherson), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), Snow, Johanna and Finnick (Sam Claflin). Taken as a whole the roller coaster of emotions makes sense, and they are a big part of the movie. Every scene invokes a different emotion and sometimes more than one at the same time.Second, I will describe one scene because it has nothing to do with the plot of the movie. After all the tributes are introduced in the parade, Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch are making their way to the District 12 apartments, Johanna Mason from District 7, joins them in the elevator. Johanna is disgusted by the dress her stylist makes her wear and begins disrobing in front of the others. She asks Peeta to unzip her dress and then peels it off, leaving her naked. Katniss is visibly disturbed by this. Haymitch and Peeta give admiring glances. Don't worry, nothing is shown. It is a PG-13 movie after all. It's just the idea of Johanna Mason (Jenna Malone) disrobing is... exciting.The third thing I liked was the graphics. The graphics in Catching Fire play a big part in the film and were excellently done. Since the graphics play a big part in this film I won't describe them, however, I will say that without them the whole series would probably be very boring.",10,2,25,25 November 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Excellent!
","Of the three movies this one is by far my favorite. I like this one because it actually has more intrigue than the other two. I say that because in this one we find out that there have been many secrets kept both from the Autobots and by the Autobots. Of course there have always been secrets on the side of the Decepticons, but why wouldn't there be when they only exist to deceive.One thing I didn't like about this one was Megan Fox wasn't in it. However, Michael Bay made up for it by casting Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in a new role as Sam Witwicky's (Shia LeBeouf) girlfriend. So my disappointment is short lived, especially with the shot of Carly (Rosie) walking up the stairs wearing, what I believe to be, Sam's shirt over just her in her panties. After all Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was a model, and presumably still is, so this is something she has done in the past.I don't want to give the ending away so I'll just describe the scenes I liked in Transformers: Dark of the Moon.The first scene I liked was when the assassin robot named Laserbeak kills Jerry Wang (Ken Jeong). Laserbeak throws Jerry out of an office building window. As Jerry is falling he falls right by a window that Bruce Bezos (John Malkovich) is looking out of. Bruce immediately heads for Sam Witwicky and tells him that he won't mention anything that he may have seen in the men's room. (Don't ask, just watch.) Moments later Laserbeak, who had transformed into a photocopier, transforms and starts attacking humans. Laserbeak is specifically looking to either kill or capture Sam. But Sam escapes.The next scene I liked was when Sam attempts to save Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy) from being captured by the Decepticons. Unfortunately, it is not known by NEST, Sam or Optimus Prime, that Sentinel Prime had joined the Decepticons. The line he uses is 'You simply fail to understand, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.' I couldn't figure out where I had heard that line before, then I thought of who said it. Leonard Nimoy said that exact line, well not the 'You Simply fail to understand,' part, but the rest, in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Don't you love when they recycle lines like that, especially making the actor who said it nearly 30 year before say it again?The rest of my favorites are when Sam, Lennox (Josh Duhamel), Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and several others infiltrate Chicago. They are trying to stop Sentinel from bringing Cybertron to Earth, basically turning Earth into their new Cybertron. There is a scene where Sam, Epps and several others are in a sky-scrapper that has been partially knocked over, that is a pretty cool scene.All I have to say about all three of these movies, and the new set of movies Michael Bay is putting together with a different main cast, is if you can't find something about these movies to like, then you might not be the Science Fiction, Action or Transformers fan you think you are. Not saying you to be any or all three to like these movies, but it helps. Hell you could be a fan of CGI and get something out of this movie you like.I give this 10 out of 10.",10,5,7,20 September 2013
The Bourne Supremacy," Superb!
","The pace of these movies are fast. If you look away from the screen for a second you miss something. This movie doesn't disappoint. I love these movies. None of these movies have outdone any of the others. They have matched each other in every way.Matt Damon reprises his role as Jason Bourne. Back again is Franka Potente as Marie; Brian Cox as Ward Abbott; and Julia Stiles as Nicky. New characters are Pamela Landy, played by Joan Allen, and Kirill, played by Karl Urban.Two years after the first movie Jason Bourne is drawn out of hiding, well hiding in plain sight, because he is set-up as the fall guy. Because of the set-up Pamela Landy is set on Bourne's trail and she is relentless. Relentless until she figures out that Bourne had nothing to do with what went wrong with her operation.The chase scenes are really what make this movie worth while. Those and the rest of the script. So I would have to say that from start to finish this is a great movie... just like the others.Just like Identity I have some favorite scenes. And guess what? They are all action scenes.The first is the scene where Jason and Marie are trying to get away from Kirill. Kirill is the one who has set Jason up that screwed up Pamela Landy's operation. Kirill goes to India to kill Jason, but he kills Marie instead.The second scene I like is when Jason goes to Moscow to apologize to the daughter of the couple he killed in his first assignment. He was only supposed to kill Vladimir Neski and make it look like natural causes. However, Neski's wife arrives unexpectedly and Jason has to change his plans. He set it up to look like Neski was killed by his wife and then shot herself.Another favorite scene is when Jason and Pamela have their final phone conversation. Pamela tells Jason what his real name is. This scene shows at least some familiarization or a friendship brewing between Pamela and Jason.I love these movies.I give this 10 stars out of 10.",10,1,3,11 August 2013
