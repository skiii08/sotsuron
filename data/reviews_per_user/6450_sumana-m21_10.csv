The Ring," A Masterpiece of horror!
","The Ring is simply one of my all-time favorite horror movies. It lives, breathes and dies with horror. Most movies seem to lack certain elements that don't serve to bring a lasting impression on you. But this is just the kind of horror movie that will leave you feeling utterly helplessly creepy even days after you have walked out of the theater. The disturbing scenes, the creepy music, the cabin in the woods setting, everything seems just right enough! Rent it, not alone of course, enjoy it with a group of friends. It's definitely worth watching if you are a true horror fan! WARNING: If you cannot handle psychological horror mixed with ghostly images, creepy settings,intense thrillers, then this is NOT the movie for U!!!",9,1,1,30 May 2009
Knowing," May not be sutiable for 13+
","There are many things which need to be underlined in this movie. It's not suitable to watch for teens who cannot withstand horror/thriller. I am 25 and I was spooked by some of the scenes in the first half of this movie. So I'm guessing it should be categorized under mystery/horror/thriller. There are some slight tense sequences. As the title suggests, it started out very well, plot seemed really good but when we reached the middle of the movie, something seriously went wrong. It was almost as if they targeted young adults to watch the beginning of the movie, then drastically altered the storyline introducing some weird people who layed stones and towards the end of the movie, it was good for 8 yr olds to watch. I mean, it was kind of senseless. What could have been a beautiful mystery movie, turned out to be a pathetic SCI-FI horror mixed with some crude jokes and mindless sentimental scenes.I suggest you not waste your money or time watching it.",2,3,8,30 March 2009
Insidious," Not scary, funny at times, lame storyline
","5.5/10Darn, this movie was not scary. I read into all the good reviews here and was biting my nails as the movie began. I was so tensed and stressed out even before it began. I watch horror movies all the time. With regards to this movie, if you are 8 years old you will be scared no doubt, but not for adults. And I even saw a bunch of 8 yr olds walk into the theater and then I knew something wasn't right. It was more like taking your kids to the carnival to see some scary looking clowns. My husband and I were bored half way through, we just wanted it to be over. The script started out pretty well but the writer went overboard. In this day and age no soul would believe the things which the folks in this movie believed. There's got to be a decent scientific explanation to everything, you can't just close your eyes and vanish into the 'Further'.",6,3,10,22 May 2011
Gran Torino," Beautiful movie!
","You have to wait till the end. Because that's the beginning. OK maybe I'm wrong in the way I word it. But, just when I thought this movie was going to be boring, lame, silly, stupid, I was caught in suspense, anger, simply a wide range of emotions running wild inside me. You have got to see it to believe it. It's just an ordinary film, not much action involved, more or less a high profile drama. And if that's what you crave for, you'll love this one! It starts off at quite a slow pace and speeds up rather slowly, embarking one of the most karmic adventures you would ever take in one's life. In other words, go watch it!",10,0,6,20 June 2009
Paranormal Activity," It's not very scary!
","Don't trust the hype. I was really scared to watch this movie, my husband bought the tickets and I was still hesitant to sit through this movie and that's because I'm a total wimp when it comes to horror movies. Anything related to the supernatural scares me for days and sometimes even weeks. It just physically affects me. So hearing, reading all the hype that came out of this movie, I was holding to my seat as it started. The first few minutes into the film, I did not feel relaxed, rather was building up tension thinking this is going to be it. But, but but, as the movie progressed I only felt calmer and more relaxed.Let me spill out some pros and cons related to this movie: Pros: 1. For the low budget cost of this movie, its pretty well done. 2. It's not really that shaky like others have mentioned, at least I didn't feel much of it. 3. This movie will scare young adults (13 - 17), but will be a good laugh for anyone over 20. 4. The movie has a lot of jokes and it's not that boring.Cons:1. It's not scary, let me repeat this. It was not scary. If you get scared by the slightest noise in your house, then you maybe scared. 2. I felt the movie was too short, it's almost as if I wanted a really suspenseful ending, but it wasn't good (something which I expected)! 3. I watched this movie, came back to my house, was sitting in my room and I heard a thud thud thud and lights flicker, and I know, I was just laughing like crazy! :-) I give it a 7/10 since it might scare teens, and it was pretty well done.",7,0,1,2 November 2009
Taken," Superb fast paced action thriller!
","I give this movie a straight 9/10. All I can say is, you need to go and watch it if you haven't already. It's not just some action movie, its got a solid storyline depicting something which is happening for real in today's world. It's sad how so many innocent young women get trafficked each year. It is simply a must see. Although its a PG 13 movie, some scenes may not be suitable for 13 year olds. But it's a movie every parent should watch and be alert with their children. And for others to be aware. The acting is pretty good, although the teenagers did seem to be a little too overexcited (not sure if that's typical of every teen). But the movie is on the move 10 minutes into it. You won't get bored at all!",9,0,4,22 February 2009
Drag Me to Hell," What has happened to the Horror genre?
","I didn't like the movie at all. Where was the horror? Simply having loud noises boom at your ear every once in a while shouldn't be the factor to make you jump. In fact you don't even need loud sound effects to creep you out. Once in a while it's okay, but not throughout the movie and for every scene. I just got bored of it. The movie was very dragging, sort of similar to it's name, I guess. And you could sorta guess how the ending would turn out to be, DUH! Horror + comedy + goo simply don't go well together. They should be kept apart in the scenes at least. It's only going to grose you out to the point where you will feel like throwing up if you're eating something. Save yourself the money and watch this sometime for free, like in a few years maybe. Oh and btw, your 13-14 yr olds might get scared with the sound effects being so harsh. So beware!",3,32,69,30 May 2009
Super 8," Super CRAP
","I did not have any expectations when I went to watch the movie and even then I thought it was a complete waste of time. The plot just got dumber and dumber and finally it ended. If you are a 6 yr old who has never seen a monster movie in your life you might like it. Other than that it's just crap. If you have seen the trailer you have seen the best parts of the movie, so don't bother watching it. I'm not even clear how Steven Spielberg could make such a pathetic movie?? We are not in 1980's anymore so he should stop bringing in those elements. It just doesn't work. Not with the sci-fci genre.In short, the film starts out with a bunch of kids wanting to make a movie, they experience a horrible train crash and then everything goes awry from there. The monster/alien is supposedly attacking people, but when he approaches a kid and gets a 5 min sensitive talk the alien packs his bags and leaves earth??? That's got to be lame. On top of that, put in a couple of sleazy jump scenes with loud noises and that's about it. The only positive thing about the movie is the train accident scene.",4,5,9,18 June 2011
Rosemary's Baby," More like mystery/drama and not horror
","If this movie was made in 2011, it would have received a 5.5/10 rating. Please don't be fooled by the genre listed in as horror because it simply isn't. I was not scared, no chills or thrills, just plain bored. If you want to watch horror, I'd recommend the classics Exorcist, Omen or The Shining. Now watch that and see if you can sleep with your lights on. I was all fired up to be on the edge of my seat, but as the movie progressed I felt there wasn't going to be anything scary, a little bit of mystery yes since Rosemary does not know whether she is delusional or her neighbors are really out to get her baby., but that's about it. The ending is a little lame too. After a watching a movie for nearly 2 hours long you will expect a scarier ending.",6,0,2,8 June 2011
Final Destination," Death by Design!
","I loved the idea of 'Death by design'. It brings out the necessary fear in each one of us if we were to believe that we were all somehow interconnected, sitting on this chain of destruction awaiting us. Yet in this movie this interconnected web is a small group of friends who have happened to have escaped death the very first time around.Although the whole plot gets way too unrealistic towards the end, it still manages to capture your mind and keep you guessing what's next and where this is heading.Nobody knows why they are born and where they will go after death or even when they will die etc. Many questions lie unanswered by science only to suggest the idea or even the very notion of - if or whether someone can predict death/destruction coming towards someone or themselves.Its not a great movie, if you like horror or thriller too much you may not enjoy this one, it just taunts your mind with sculpted ideas.6.5/10, acting wasn't good, ending was boring and a little cheesy. Good for a Saturday afternoon flick!",7,1,1,24 January 2010
