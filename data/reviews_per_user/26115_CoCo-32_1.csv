The Blair Witch Project," Totally empty movie...
","I found this movie totally empty. The story is ultra simple (and you discover nothing more than what is already told by the critics, there is absolutely no suspense related to the scenario), the characters have nothing special, pictures (photographs) are null, as bad as the music (there is NONE), and it is not even scary because you see absolutely NOTHING, everything is suggested... I have the most difficulty to understand how the directors were able to trap that many movie-watchers to get them say that there is any interest in this movie. From this point of view, they really are genius...I consider the directors of this movie the Micro$oft of the cinema !!",Null,0,0,18 September 1999
