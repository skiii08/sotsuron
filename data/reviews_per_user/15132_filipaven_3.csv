Blade Runner 2049," Really slow, boring and quiet
","I saw the movie in the cinema tonight. The movie is really slow-moving, with long scenes with limited story and much reflection. Often the scenes are without any music/dialogue. The movie is way too long based on the actual story and should be shortened by minimum 75 %. I was personally very bored by this movie, and from my perspective this is the worst movie I have seen this year. Some sporadic music without any logic to the story development; the music could indicate something happening, and then nothing happens. In my opinion this is an awful movie, unless of course you are a intensily dedicated Blade Runner fan. A suitable category description of this movie would be: slow, quiet, reflection drama.",1,7,13,25 November 2017
Dunkirk," Strong movie
","Strong movie with high intensity: Remarkable nerve in this movie with significant exciting story. Top quality music in the whole film. Even though the story of Dunkirk is well-known, this movie has found a few individual stories that are highly interesting. Highly recommendable. The movie is for adults, and in my opinion it is best for war-interested people.",10,1,11,25 November 2017
The Mist," Really bad
","Good story in the start and middle. Intense and intriguing. Plausible characters. Too much crazy Christian characters for my taste. The monsters were great. Sone of the plot is original, however some is quite ordinary and common.Really bad ending. Destroys the whole film",1,2,12,1 April 2017
