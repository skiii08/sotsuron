The Monuments Men," History lesson
","I wanted to see this for the actors in the movie. So many good performers in a film based on truth. I especially liked Cate Blanchett's performance as the woman who eventually gave the soldiers the information they needed. She portrayed a hesitant woman in a dangerous time - she knew her life was in danger if found out and was careful about saying anything. The unlikely group, with little military knowledge were at times comical but always believable. The mission they were given was so important for the art world and the individuals the art was stolen from. If it weren't for these men we would not be able to enjoy the Madonna and Child by Michelangelo, the many paintings in the Lourve and families would not have been reunited with their paintings. At times the movie seemed a little slow, but the acting is well done and the history lesson is important for all. Hitler had instructed for all the collections to be destroyed if he lost the war - we have many reasons to be thankful to these Monument Men.",8,13,26,9 February 2014
Rocketman," They say biographies do not make good movies -WRONG
","Two years in a row - great movies about great musicians. This film is introduced so well and the telling by Elton John of how he got where is was in the different timeframes - well done. Also the music connections to what he was going through at the time - well done. Learned so much about his life - two uncaring and incapable of caring parents, but thank heaven for his grandmother since she was the only one in the house who encouraged him.
Another movie about the hard time a gay person has when trying to be themselves. Yes it deserves the R rating and I am glad Elton Joh insisted that he had not led a PG-13 life.
Stay for the credits - so worth it. Hope this gets the oscars it deserves.",10,3,6,22 June 2019
A Star Is Born," No spoilers for me
","I have now seen the three remakes of A Star is Born -and this one is fantastic. Kudos to Bradley Cooper for an amazing success in directing, writing and starring in this movie. His talent is incredible and shown so well in this film. I so appreciated his use of the closeup filming - right in the actors faces and making it so intimate for the audience. The concert scenes were so fun - made you feel you were there.
Lady Gaga - a new film star and hopefully Oscar nominee. Besides her voice being a huge part of the film, she has developed great acting skills. Her emotions were right on through out the film.
Sam Elliott - so much fun to see him in this role - and no matter your age he is a pleasure to see and listen too.
This is one of the best films of the year and I really hope those who worked on it get the honors they deserve.",10,0,1,10 October 2018
Gravity," beautiful cinematography
","The movie goer is transported to a place the vast majority of us will never go. I now have a greater respect for astronauts -besides the technical side of their work - the personal side comes out, and the working with other nations in space. Ryan is the newbie - a medical trained astronaut who is running from a sad event in her life - as she says 'she drives'. With an experienced astronaut they are subjected to a happening that probably could happen. Their dependence on each other and then the training that makes for the rest of the story - they are smart. The best part of the story is the cinematography - the filming is amazing and I admire the director and all who were able to do this film - it is one of the best. Even though there are some things not true - you do believe it when you see it. I have read about this and admire the actors for what they did - I'm sure it was a challenge in many ways. I really liked this file - but with what I consider a really great film, I cannot get it out of my mind for several days. I saw this yesterday and that has not happened with it. But the cinematography did- it is worthy of an Oscar.",8,8,11,27 October 2013
The Impossible," The Impossible
","A incredible movie of parental and family love. This obviously loving family settle in at a resort in Thailand, celebrate Christmas, and then the most horrific event happens. The tsunami hits the coast of Thailand and their lives are changed to survival. I could never imagine the force of the water that hit the coast -the movie does a great job of giving you that feeling. Then the people - the destruction of families is so hard to watch - the hope of families survives. This family was so fortunate and obviously have a deep love for each other. The father searching for his wife and son, and at the same time sending his other boys off to safety. Tom Holland who plays Lucas is terrific - the connection between him an Naomi Watts is believable. He gives a great performance. Naomi Watts is equally good as the mother - wounded in many ways and still not giving up. She knows what is happening to her body and tries to hang one and have hope. At times this was a hard movie to watch but I think it is truthfully presented - being a nurse the conditions of the makeshift hospital - it was horrific. And yet given the conditions - life went on. The people searching for loved ones is well presented. A good film of a sometimes hard to watch event - good work coming out of Spain.",9,1,3,23 January 2013

",An well done depiction of the struggles Jackie Robinson went through to just play baseball. I think all the casting was well done -especially Chadwick Boseman and Harrison Ford. It was hard to see the discrimination then and knowing how it continued for many years - but that was the time of my parents and it was true to the time (so sad). I think Harrison Ford should get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor - it is such a good performance. I totally forgot who the actor was and got into the personality of Branch Rickey - it was all about the best for the baseball team - but he had a heart too for his players. It was fun to see J.R.Knight in a film again - I have always liked him. I liked the music (I grew up with it) and the costuming was accurate. The sets were well done and the language - that is the way it was - not tolerated now thank heaven. Jackie Robinson was a man of honor and strength - an admirable man.,8,4,4,6 May 2013
The Danish Girl," Well told
","This true story is not for everyone - some will never get the struggle that a person like the main character goes through. And they could learn but the their own misunderstanding would keep that from happening. This takes place in the 1920's - both the main characters are artists and they truly love each other. Alisha Vikinder is amazing as the wife- her acceptance of her husbands condition is so well shown, her love for him and willingness to help is so evident, and then her frustrations with the course things take. Hers is an amazing performance. Eddie Redmayne is an actor who is willing to take chances and he took one with this role - he is amazing and so believable. I'm sure an Oscar nomination is coming his way - again. I recommend it for anyone with an open mind - it is a story well told.",9,0,5,5 January 2016
Knives Out," Excellent
","Such a fun and good movie with an exceptional cast. There are standout moments for all the actors but this is an ensemble cast.
The individual stories come out slowly, the gothic home has so much to see and I wish the camera would have stayed longer on some of the scenes. Each possible family member as a suspect is played so well - Don Johnson, Jamie lee Curtis, Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer - all are so good.
The twists and turns come quick - the piano note by the detective - a good mystery. Like a game of clue - with many suspects.",10,1,5,2 January 2020
Concussion," Will Smith shines
",I come from a medical background - I have read about CTE because I have a grandchild who plays football - I had to see this movie. Will Smith gives a great performance as the forensic neuropathologist who sees the changes in the brains of several Pittsburgh Steeler players who died before they should have. Of course this takes him on the journey of trying to get the NFL to recognize the dangers of concussion. Not a battle he wanted - he just wanted to help keep CTE from happening. I have to confess - I do not support pro sports for many reasons - the main one being that they focus on the money - not the player. The NFL did not want the players to know the dangers - even when they knew them. This is well portrayed in this movie. I admire this doctor for what he did and the fact that he persisted. At the end of the movie it is stated that it is believed that 28% of professional football players have CTE - that alone should wake the public up.,9,3,9,5 January 2016
Molly's Game," Better than I thought it would be.
","I really liked this film - better than I thought it would be. I liked the fast pace, the actors, the fact that this is a true story and the reality of it.
Idris Elba's performance as Molly's attorney is so good - when you think he will say no - it becomes yes. Jessica Chastain is so believable as the main character - and this it through her ups and downs. The scene with her father is real.
A very good afternoon treat.",9,1,4,14 January 2018
Lion," 80000/yr. lost
","An amazing film on so many levels - the story, the cinemaography, the acting and the ending. Based on the true story of a young Indian boy who is separated from his brother and end up 1500 miles from home. He is adopted by an Australian couple and thereby rescued from a orphanage with horrendous conditions. In his twenties he starts a search for his mother and brother - aided by the electronic help of Google earth. Of course this becomes his obsession. And finally he finds the street where he lived and returns to his village. You want a happy ending and there is one. And at the end you find out that his adoptive parents also visit India. This is a quiet film - told a lot by just facial expressions. It does not need much dialogue - the photography is well representing the face of India. And that this is a story of many children - only this one has the happy ending. Dev Patel's performance is so well done - he is a talent.l",9,0,0,5 February 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," No perfect but SO entertaining.
","Like being at a rock concert with hundreds of people. So entertaining with so much of the backdrop story - and that is not all perfect or timely - but well done..
Fun to see the work that went into the creating of such good music. I think all the people in the theater were tapping their feet and silently singing along.
A very entertaining film and with an excellent cast - do not expect the timing in the last half to be totally accurate - and do not care about it either.
This is not a documentary and just enjoy the music, the reality of what it must be like to travel in a rock band. You get to see the humaness of the bank too.
I will see this more than once - a great way to spend 2+ hours.",9,3,4,5 November 2018
Dallas Buyers Club," 2 Amazing performances
","I remember when the AIDS disease became the epidemic in the 80's - I worked in a hospital and the education we received was very involved. To watch the reactions by Ron Woodruff's friends with the news of his diagnosis is accurately portrayed. The film does a good job of the things that those with AIDS went through. The frustration of the victims in getting treatment, of having the respect they deserve as a human being. Matthew McConaughey is not my favorite actor - but this performance is incredible. He shows his anger, frustration, his weaknesses and his smarts - and it is all so believable. Jared Leto gives an award winning performance - he does an incredible performance of another troubled man in this imperfect world. He deserves many more acting roles - such a good talent. An incredible movie about an imperfect person who made a difference and so well presented.",9,2,2,17 January 2014
Jackie," Camelot told again
","Two main reasons for watching this film for me - I was a freshman in college when JFK was killed and I wanted to see how Natalie Portman portrayed her. That is a day I will never forget - yes the Kennedys were the royalty of the United States - a handsome President, A beautiful wife and young children. The sudden change in her life had to have been incredibly hard for her to endure and all in the public eye. The nation was mourning but nothing could compare with HER grief. Portman's portrayal is so good - the grief, the mothering, the trying to have her husband honored, and of course there is the Kennedy family wishes and then she is homeless. She was not able to grieve alone and that would have been so hard. Everything she did was so public. I like the way the story is presented - an interview with a reporter and of course she had control of how it would be presented. The usage of old film to help tell the story was done well - soon the young will not know the story as I do. The White House must hold so many secrets - wish the wall could talk.",8,2,6,21 January 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," True to the book
","I read the book several months ago and have been anxious for the movie. So this grandmother went with her 16 yr old grandson who had also read the book. We are both happy with the adaptation. The story of two teens with cancer who meet in a support group for teens, neither want sympathy and both knowing they will die - want to live life. They exchange books and because of the ending of one and the questions they have - they email the author in Amsterdam. Because he had not used up is 'wish' they end up being able to go there and have the chance to meet the author. Willam Defoe portrays the alcoholic author so well - you do not like him. Gus also tells Hazel something he has been keeping from her. Gus and Hazel have their ups and downs and knowing their time may be limited their love is fresh and true - and presented so well. All the acting is good, the sets, the music -and there is a lot of music but I did not notice most of it - a sign of a good movie score. I volunteer in a hospice facility and it was so good to see the presentation of their cancer as real. Their feelings of what they are going thru as real. I will read the book again and see the movie again - it is worth it.",10,45,81,6 June 2014
The Favourite," Impaired Queen
","Queen Anne - ill and quick tempered has given power over to her friend Lady Sarah. She is making the decisions about war and running the country. Enter Abigail to the household and the competition begins between the two. Interesting glimpse into the activities of the queen household - not the upstairs/downstairs king. Power struggles.
Good acting, beautiful costumes, 17 rabbits and a lot of back biting. Guess how it comes ends!??!",8,3,6,11 January 2019
The Theory of Everything," Awesome biography
","An amazing movie - Eddie Redmayne's performance is so real that you forget he is an actor - he is Stephan Hawking. The preparation he must have done for this part has to have been gruesome - the changes in his facial features, the things the disease did to his body - so well portrayed. I forgot he was an actor - he is Hawking. The story is important for many reasons. The focus on the disease and its progression, the affects of it on their marriage, and the genius of his mind was not affected. Felicity Jones is just as good as his wife - never knowing the course the marriage would have to go through - she was devoted to him through it all - even though she was loosing the sense of herself. In reality, you wonder how she was able to raise three kids and take care of Stephan and always be there for him. Her performance is worthy of awards too.The movie is well casted, well written and I hope there are many awards coming its way.",9,4,7,29 November 2014
Room," so well done
","This is a movie that I wanted to see and at the same time knew it would be hard to watch. And it was. The acting by Ma and Jack is so realistic and has been rewarded so many times for Brie Larsen. Jacob Trembley deserves more awards but I look forward to seeing this young man again and again. To put a story of a woman who is kidnapped at 17, and has a child, and finds a way to get him out of the Room - on the screen could not have been easy. The ability of Ma to keep Jack curious, to teach him, and protect him - to well presented. The script is so good. You are presented the aftermath of the events and they are presented with such probable truth. To go back to a world that is different that you had at 17 and then a 5 yr. old being able to experience it for the first time - well done. I am glad I saw it - wish I had seen it when it first can out - but will never forget this film.",10,0,3,4 March 2016
Hidden Figures," Excellent representation of the 60's
","A well told story of the 60's - fashion, seriousness of the space competition, but more importantly the contributions of 3 women in a time where they were not even given the credit of having a brain. Why this has not been known for many, many years - that is a sad state. Thank heaven the daughter wrote the book and these women will have the credit they so deserved. A good showing of the discrimination shown the black people in the 60's - it was well represented but the story took front page. I love these women - they were mothers, wives and eventually recognized as experts in their field of math and coding. I grew up in the late 50 and 60's - so impressive that the three did not let anything hold them back. They did it quietly and with respected results - but this story should have been told in the 60's. The acting is excellent, the sets are so believable, the culture is there - thank you Theodore Malfi for a an entertaining and educational film. And Pharrell for the music.",10,104,209,13 January 2017
Coco," Excellence in animation
","Such a tribute to the Mexican heritage - shown so well in the history of the family, the history of the family problem, the legends of the Day of the Dead. Not only a movie that teaches about families and history - it is beautiful.
The animation - as expected from Pixar - is incredible. So colorful and I love the explanation by the three Pixar contributors is so good - will make the average person who does not understand animation - appreciate it and all the work that goes into it.
And then there is Remember Me - truly deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. For once there is a song that I will remember too. A fun film beautifully done.",10,2,4,2 January 2018
The Imitation Game," a story that needed to be told
","I had read about this film and became more curious about the story. It is told so well with flashbacks to the main characters time in school, to the 1950's, and back again to the main story. These five people broke the code used by Hilter and as reported, probably ended the war 2 yrs. earlier than if the code was not broken. This is a story of the breaking of the code and more importantly the story of Alan Turing - a very interesting and brilliant man who struggled with who he was. The performance by Benedict Cumberbatch is so good - no wonder there is Oscar talk. You see the internal struggle and learn so much more about him. Kiera Knightly is excellent as the only woman in this group - in a time when women were only allowed to be secretaries. All of the characters are well portrayed. In a year of many films made on true life people this one stands out. I hope the past history of the Academy - to not honor biographical movies - changes this next award ceremony. I will be thinking of this movie for a long time.",10,4,12,24 December 2014
La La Land," Charming BUT
","I can only give LaLa Land a 6. With all the hype I really thought I would be more entertained. The story has been told so many times. The dance scenes are fun - not quite old Hollywood but close. The special affects were fun - like the dancing in the stars - actually quite beautiful even though you can tell how they did it. Very little dialogue -and that was OK but it was missing something to me - cannot quite put my finger on it. The colorful costumes were fun, the music was good but I do not think I will be humming any song tomorrow. John Legend was good - and he did write some good songs for the movie. So to me, it was an interesting movie and if the Oscars had a musical best movie award - it would probably get it since there is little competition. I do not see it as a best movie for 2016. I do not think I will be thinking of this film in the next week and to me, when I am still thinking of it later then it has stirred something in me to make it memorable. I know it took a long time to get this film made and I respect the diligence of the director to do that. But it just did not do it for me.. Sorry- I think I may be in the minority but that is my opinion..",6,5,9,20 January 2017
Woman in Gold," A story that needed to be tole
","I have been looking forward to this movie because of the story and the art. I have always liked the Woman in Gold - I have done needlework that also represents his style. This movie is quietly told - no yelling, no fights, just legal arguments about why the artwork belonged to Maria Altman. I liked the way the flashbacks were presented throughout the whole movie - I felt her pain in those memories. I have read negative reviews of Ryan Reynolds performance and disagree with them. He portrays a lawyer with no practice who learns more about himself as this case goes on and on, and it leads him to the supreme court and back to Vienna. I appreciated the quietness of this film - I think it is a movie that should be shown to teenagers, and watched by those of us who know the backdrop of this story. It is a fact of history but the story of what happened to families is so important to not be forgotten. Well done.",8,2,3,10 April 2015
Les Misérables," Les Mis
","First of all I have seen the stage version 3 times and love it. However I feel the movie was good, but not great. My negatives are Russell Crowe when he sang, Amanda Seyfried also. Anne Hathaway was good - not great. Hugh Jackman was better. I feel Sacha Baron Cohen was miscast, but Helena Bonham Carter was good. However the best to me was Eddie Redmayne - his version of Empty Chairs and Empty Tables was the best I have ever seen. My main problem with the movie is how it was filmed - it is a movie of close -close ups and it was hard to watch after awhile. When the camera went back to the whole scene - or half of it- it was easier to watch. I much prefer being able to see the whole scene - not just the face of the main character at the time. The music is fantastic - the orchestrations were worthy of the music. There is so much going on in each scene and I think Hooper could have done that better. I will see the stage version any chance I get - but not the movie version.",7,0,1,16 January 2013
Murder on the Orient Express," Beautiful in many ways
","This film is amazing in so many ways - the cast, the cinematography, the costumes, the flow. Knowing the book - this is still a newly told story. You feel the cold where the train is stopped by an avalanche. You feel the tension of each passenger, and slowly the story comes together. Watch the credits - the beautiful song at the end is written by Branagh and sung by Michelle Pfeiffer - a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this film - a delight to watch.",10,4,12,26 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Not my dogs
","I was looking forward to the release of this movie -previews for such a long time. So waited to go till grandkids were available. and it is not as good as other animated movies released this summer. I did like Max and Buddy - Buddy because I have a dachshund. One of the best things in life is to see a creature that wants to see you so badly when you get home. Back to the movie - the home scenes were fun. The underground bad dogs - not so The references to the crime like people - so over done and how appropriate for young children - that is very debatable. I realize that many children would not understand it and it is the emphasis on the wrongness of bullying - not appropriate. They may not understand it now, but it is in their minds. So some fun things but on an adult level no so good. The animation was OK but being up against the BFG - no contest as to which is better - the BFG. This is not a movie I would have on hand for any future viewing.",6,1,1,2 August 2016
Finding Dory," Deep blue sea search
",Having grand kids we definitely wanted to see this film - and we are happy we did. I think that the feelings for the original film about Nemo is still there - just has another focus this time around. Dory still has her memory problems and this time you really want her to find her home. I love Hank - the animation of him is incredible - stay for the ending credits as they are so much fun. As Pixar usually does these well. The animation of Dory appeared to be more plastic to me - we did not see the 3D version but the last movie was better in some instances because of that. The notion that Dory was looking for her parents and slowly remembering things was good for kids. They cheered when she found her parents - the shells were a great way to have her find home. A well done animated movie - just not the same as Nemo.,8,2,9,30 June 2016
Parasite," best International movie/ not best movie
","Curiosity about this film - two families - one very rich and entitled and one very poor with little hope for the future. The poor family appear to be street smart and the rich just more entitled. Slowly the entire family become entwined with the rich based on lie after lie.
As the story evolves it become certain that this will not end well - and because of the birthday party, unlike any I have ever seen on screen, that happens.
The ending is tragic except for one member - I won't say who. The film is a tragedy on as many levels as there are in the home.
The star of the film for me is the home of the rich - confusing writing of the film - one place states it was a set built for the film and another talks about the house as though it was not.
I have to be very honest about this film - I would never watch it again. I strongly feel that it probably deserved the international film Oscar. But as for best movie Oscar - no.",7,2,5,20 February 2020
The Big Short," Well told true story
","As a person who understands how this housing bubble burst (not affected personally) - this is a well told story. The acting is great - the inserts of a chef explaining things, and a pop star - very interesting tactic. The individual characters are all well acted and developed. Many people do not get that the banks play games with the average person - as it says at the end of the movie - they just use different words for their products. The main focus of the bank is to make money - not help the consumer and this was rampant in the 90's. People need a place to live - do not put down your income-or lack of. Leave some of the questions blank - no one will care by the time it gets passed off and passed off and passed off and approved. ARM's - to me an automatic money maker for the mortgage holder and not the homeowner - oh that is right the mortgage holder owns the home. This is a movie that more people should see - the acting is great - the story is told well and all need to watch what happens in the future.",9,17,23,5 January 2016
Green Book," Good picture of the south in the 60's
","Two men from vastly different backgrounds come together as a pianist needs a driver for a tour of the south in the 60's. Constantly at differences and constantly learning from each other - they ended up good friends in real life.
A really good cast portraying complicated people and presenting the south of the 60's ( not belying the fact that some of this remains).
A good film of the story of two men - and not seen in any movies. I really enjoyed it. M. Ali so deserved the Golden Globe award for best supporting actor. Loved the growth of both men.",10,1,3,11 January 2019
Incredibles 2," Fun movie
","Ok I started watching this movie on a cruise ship - we were outside, it was windy and cold, so I only watched half of the movie. Then on the flight home I watched the second part - so actually I saw the whole movie.
It is fun - the mother becomes the main character and hero, the father is the house husband with the three kids while discovering the powers of the baby.
Comical, fun and entertaining - good vs. evil and of course you know the winner.",8,1,1,7 January 2019
Joy," Some Joy
","I was looking forward movie - and with all the pre-release hype - I thought I would 100% like it. Well not so. the character development of her family left them as looking like squatters in her home (I think it was her home) - the mother, father, ex-husband. To me they had little redeeming characteristics, and with the strength of Joy - I got frustrated with her keeping them there. She was used by all of them. Possibly this is a New Jersey thing - but it bugged me. Joy had a great idea - got in over her head initially and learned so much as she grew as a business woman. The movie, in the beginning states that this is for women who are -- I forget - those who are trying to make a go of it?? So this is an OK movie - not great - and if you really want to see it - Redbox it. My only disappointment in Dec. was this movie.",6,0,4,5 January 2016
Her," the future??
","I know so many people who do not like this film but I really liked it. I was fascinated with the electronics - the games, the ability to tell an OS what to do and have it done in minutes. I am not electronic savvy and don't know if I ever will be and one of my pet peeves is the ways people are so plugged into their devices and do not communicate with each other in person. I strongly feel that so many people are missing out on REAL people. Joaquin Phoenix is so good as Theo - and it is easy to see why he is falling for Samantha. He is going through a divorce, he is very introverted and has no life. He just writes computer generated letters for others. Samantha gives him a life when she wants to learn more and see more and he becomes dependant on her, for him to have a life. I loved his apartment but wanted to decorate it. The room sized gaming looked so fun - but it also got frustrated with him. This movie generated some very interesting conversation afterwards. Mostly talk about the differences in the generations and how fast things are changing and is it worth it to loose the in person communication between people.",9,1,3,12 January 2014
