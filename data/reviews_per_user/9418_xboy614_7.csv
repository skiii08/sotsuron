Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes- brought the child out in me
","The new Sherlock Holmes, which had huge boots to fill from the first one had clearly stuck in my mind. Action, comedy, a little mystery, it was just brilliant. It brought back the child in me. It had everything you wanted in a film, romance, great fight scenes, a twisting plot and a shocking end, big guns, witty lines, a great theme tune I couldn't stop humming after wards, this is the type of movies that should get five stars. I liked Stephen Fry in the film, he was just superb as Sherlock's older brother, Mycroft. People may complain that it is really different from the Conan Doyle books and that the BBC series is better, Sherlock Holmes is probably in the top five best Sherlock Holmes movies of all time, maybe even number one.",8,1,2,15 January 2012
Skyfall," James Bond is no Shawshank Redemption....
","I've heard lots of negative comments coming from this film. Someone said that they weren't going to watch this film because he heard that the film had, 'too many plot holes and was overall tried to be arty.' I'm having none of that and I forced him to watch it and the guy enjoyed it immensely. Just like I guessed. The truth is, the film is terrific, it is powerful as a stand alone film with the much needed elements which make a Bond film so enjoyable in the first place. You really feel like the Bond team have put everything they've got into making a film for the 50 Year anniversary of the Bond film franchise. It really pays off and during the ending credits my mouth was wide open. Daniel Craig gives another show-stealing performance, his dark and moody looks mixed in with his funny one-liners will remind you of Sean Connery. M as Judi Dench gives her best performance of M out of the seven films she's been in as playing Bond's boss. I would also go as far as saying that it was one of her best performances full stop. Raoul Silva played by Jarvier Bardem might give you flashbacks of the Joker, but he brings his own twist to the character and he would of stolen the movie if the other characters weren't perfect. Bill Tanner gets a decent amount of screen time and you get to understand his character in this movie. To tell the truth, there's more characterization and emotions shown in this movie then in all of Roger Moore's 7 Bond films. It works, really well and that's all that is important. People have heard about this and are expecting Shawshank's level of themes and ideas. But, no, the film has a slight melancholy theme and the film approaches the idea about sometimes old is better then new but this just improves the storyline. If you haven't seen it, get it out now! It has enough in the film for Die hard Bond fans (like me) to get excited about little scenes and references as well as pleasing action movie fans. The action is really good and clear. No shaky-camera Bourne stuff in the film. The score, by Thomas Newman done the job well and reminds me a little of the great John Barry and the Adele song is sure to be another Bond song great up there with Goldfinger by Shirley Bassey and For Your Eyes Only by Sheena Easton. Best Bond film ever? Quite possibly on many people's lists.",10,3,9,31 March 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spiderman has kept up it's name-Amazing
","I enjoyed this film and I prefer it to the old film. Ryhs Ifans is really good as the villain and I cannot believe it is the same man who played the idiot 'Spike' in Notting Hill. Andrew Garfield is great in the role as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He adds humor to the role with sarcasm unlike Tobey Maguire's serious version as Spiderman. The actors are good, the action takes awhile to come but is at the level of a Superhero film, and the 3D is average until the fight scenes where you can go, 'Oh, yeah I forgot it was in 3D.' Nice to see the return of the web-shooters instead of just using his hands. This shows Parker's inventive side, I never you it existed in the other films. His parents have gone missing, something I brushed over in the old film but in this film it suggests that Parker came from a family of 'extra-ordinary' people. Nice to see that Aunt May doesn't look like a frail grandma who you expect is going to die any minute like the old film. But enough criticising the old film, this one is very different to the other one. it doesn't feel like a normal superhero film, and is up there with Avengers. I very much enjoyed this film, I recommend it to you if you want a nice night out at the movies",7,1,5,5 July 2012
Quantum of Solace," An underrated gem of a Movie
","Many people are throwing trash at this movie. The directing sucks, the characters are dull, there's too much action and that Craig seems wooden and that the Title Song is awful. I feel that many people don't have anything nice to say about this film. Which is a shame because I love this movie, for all its worth. I know I cannot get people to start liking this movie so I'll give you Five Reasons while its worth watching. 1. The action is awesome. It's so brutal that it is really cool. Bond is beating people senseless in this film. There is one particular fight scene in a Bell Tower which will leave you gasping for breath and smiling at the same time. The shaky camera can get annoying but it seems to work in these fight scenes for some reason, I think it's just the tone of the movie which fits in the camera. 2.This film does not feel contrived. It feels so fresh and it is definitely the most different Bond film of them all. With this in mind, it works. It may not be as good as Casino Royale, but it has this interesting level to it which will keep you wanting to watch it. 3. The villain factor. Not wanting to spoil the film, but the central villain may seem a little bland, but he works in the sense as he reveals these other villains which could be used in Bond 24 or 25. You just have to watch it to understand my drift. 4. M and Bond. If there was a movie just of Judi Dench's M and Daniel Craig's Bond interacting for two hours straight, I would watch it and enjoy it. The interaction here is perfect. 5. Casino Royale story properly finished-It finishes the Casino story properly and you can't wait for Skyfall after seeing this film. So watch it, I like it a lot, a worthy entry.",8,0,5,31 March 2013
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Ice Age 4-A worthy sequel
","I loved Ice Age the first one to death when I first watched it. I own it and every once and awhile I go to my DVD cupboard and pick it up and watch it. I disliked the sequel, Ice Age: Meltdown. The second sequel i hated too. They added new characters and I missed the chemistry and the funny lines that happened between just Sid the sloth, Manny and Diego the sabre tooth tiger. They added new characters which were sometimes funny but I missed the same three from the first one. In this third sequel the team must have realized this by splitting Sid, Manny and Diego with Sid's funny, odd grandma sloth away from the others on a race to get back to the herd and to get rid of these pirates. The pirates are entertaining as ever and very funny, the monkey played by Peter Dinklage is really good and the main plot flies along at a terrific pace. The jokes are fresh (most of them) and funny and you can't help liking this film. The side plots can get a bit clich√© but I ignored them.",7,25,36,5 July 2012
Casino Royale," A Story Telling Masterpiece...
","Many people felt discouraged when Daniel Craig was declared the sixth actor to wear the tuxedo. The five men before him, Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan seemed to have gained the critics and Bond-fans respect far easier and quicker then the first Blonde Bond. The people who grumbled and moaned about the new Bond had to be proved wrong by the first Craig film coming out in 2006, Casino Royale. Let's just say, anyone who had any doubts about Daniel Craig's performance was proved wrong as soon as the pre-titles started. Craig is Bond, he doesn't need to look like Sean Connery to prove that. I think the important factor is that Craig wasn't trying to be another Bond. He didn't try to be Connery or try to be Dalton, he tried to be Fleming's Bond with a mixture of his own style in it. Keeping away from spoilers here, Q or Moneypenny do not appear in this movie, Bond doesn't have any gadgets, any awesome cars with machine guns hidden in the boot. What the producers, Barabra Broccoli and Michael G Wilson is saying is that these things do not make a Bond film. You cannot say that it is a Bond film because Q's in it, because there are gadgets, and Moneypenny flirting scenes with last name first introductions, a Bond film is defined by the central character and how he reacts and does his assignments. On to the characters, Vesper Lynd as the Bond girl is utterly superb. Eva Green is super attractive in her own right but her character is more complex then any Pussy Galore. Her interactions with Bond are the best in the series as far as Bond/Bond girl relationships go. In a few scenes they actually feel like a team. Mathis, a character lifted straight out of the Ian Fleming novel is another good character and memories of From Russia With Love's Kerim Bey can't help but appear in my mind while I watch it. The villain, Le Chiffre has earned my respect as a Bond villain. His plot may not be like Hugo Drax but he does seem evil and someone to start loathing midway through the film. M, played again by Judi Dench has been lifted from the Brosnan era and is terrific. She didn't really had that much to do with Pierce, not counting the world is not enough, but she has lots of stuff here! Enough of the characters, watch this movie. The action scenes are amazing and Bond has taken a giant leap from Die Another Day territory.",9,2,5,31 March 2013
The Truman Show," Truman Show is a wonderful piece of cinema
","Peter Weir has casted well-known comedians into serious roles before with Robin Williams starring in Dead Poet's Society. We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.",10,0,1,30 July 2013
