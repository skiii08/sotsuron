The Incredible Hulk," Incredible Enough
","I've never really been a fan of The Incredible Hulk, and Ang lee's was definitely not my cup of tea. From what I had seen of this movie in the previews it looked like it might just redeem what Ang Lee had hoped to do. I think it did exactly that. It was entertaining, and action packed. The overall look of the Hulk was not cheesy like I found the other movie to portray him as.I thought the story was better, although I did find myself getting bored with the love story, and then again in the end fight scene. It had it's points of humor, and Norton was great. I would recommend this movie to someone who likes action movies. The very end scene is worth waiting around for.",6,4,7,16 June 2008
The Happening," If you actually have a unique thought in your head...
","I really don't understand how everyone thinks this movie is so awful...I thought the story was beyond original. MNS is one who is known for taking risks. I think he definitely did, and whether or not it's believable...it's something creative...something to think about. Movies are about getting your mind active, and taking a look at the impossible, or maybe not so impossible. I think he did just that.Here in Canada this movie was not rated R, although I wish it was. It tends to weed out the annoying girlish squeals, and the pre-pubescent laughter as they pretend they're not scared or disturbed. I thought it should have been rated R. I found some of the imagery very disturbing, there is one part that really defined the horror of this 'epidemic.' A group of unaffected civilians are driving when they see a bunch of gardening equipment on the side of the road, then rows of ladders...the next thing you see is numerous bodies, hanging from the trees. Screams filled the theater, and though people may deny later, these were genuine screams of horror.I do think some of the dialog could have been better, and I could have done without the mood ring. I think some of the acting was pretty bad, but overall this movie was a hit for me. Hopefully if you're reading this, and expecting to go to this movie and see Bruce Willis, and that creepy kid and hear 'I see dead people'....Spare everyone, and don't go! However, if you have an open mind, and understand that MNS tries to make Original movie ideas...then go, and enjoy.",8,5,12,14 June 2008
