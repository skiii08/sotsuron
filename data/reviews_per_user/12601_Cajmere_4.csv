The Devil's Advocate," Nice but not original; can you say 'Rosemary's Baby?'
","This movie was an interesting movie to watch.  I thought the acting and the cinamatagrapy were super...but, this movie lacked originality.  This movie is a combination of 'The Firm', 'The Omen' and 'Rosemary's Baby' (and it borrows heavily from the 1968 classic 'Rosemary's Baby')--like the part when the Reeve's wife changes her look to please her husband, so does Rosemary, and the part where the wife goes crazy because no one believes what is going on with her, so does Rosemary, and the part where Reeves almost sells out to the devil's firm, so too does Rosemary's husband; except he sells out to a satanic cult.  Nevertheless, 'Devils Ad' is worth watching twice, esp. the part where the lady is changing dresses and she changes into something else!",7,0,1,18 October 1998
Scream," Scream vs Halloween vs Prom Night
","Before Kevin Williamson came along I was avoiding horror movies like the plague because of the lack of originality the later 80's slasher movies had, i.e. Nightmare on Elm St. 2-4, and Halloween 3-6.  The whole genre was becoming tired and over-used.  Kevin's 'Scream' was what the genre really needed.  I think that Williamson's clever add-ons from 'Halloween' and 'Prom Night' are delightfully on-point, i.e. remember when young Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) tells Tommy and Lendsey to go to the McCensey's and call the police because of the killer, now, remember Cassey Becker's father tell her mother to go to the McCensey's to call the police because someone has killed their daughter. And remember when Tatum gets stuck in the garage while trying to flee from the killer, remember the girl in 'Halloween' trying to climb out of the window from the washroom and she gets stuck. Oh, and remember the principal Mr. Himbry expelling the kids and remember the Mr. Himbry from 'Prom Night' (also starring Jamie Lee Curtis) expelling kids from his school.  In a nutshell, the humor is very hidden with in the plot of 'Scream' and Kevin Williamson did a great job writing this movie.  But, if you haven't seen 'Halloween' or 'Prom Night' in a while rent them and see for yourself.",10,0,0,18 October 1998
Halloween," Childhood Nostalgia
","Oh the memories!  I was 9 years old when I first saw this movie on HBO with my younger cousin and older brother....it was about 1980.  It was so creepy. When the movie went off me and my cousin were too scaried to go to bed so we stayed up until the infamous 'Night Tracks' went off on TBS (REMEMBER NIGHT TRACKS??).  The 'Halloween' Movie Theme stayed with me for years. Everytime I hear the theme I think back to when I was a kid.  I would often dread when my parents would go out on the weekends and let my older brother babysit me.  I just knew that Micheal Myers would know that my parents were not home and kill me. In my opinion, a movie should stay with you long after the movie is over. That's what 'Halloween' did for me.  Each Halloween night, I remember back to 1978, when 'Halloween' came out.  I think of the young scared child that I was and how good the first 'Halloween'movie really was!",Null,6,6,3 November 1998
The Matrix," Did someone say Total Recall? or Dark City?
","This is fun entertainment.  I enjoyed watching the movie, not only for the F/X, but I wanted to know how the ending was going to turn out. The Matrix did its best to keep you in suspense, and it worked....but, I do believe that it could have done without the romance part.  Some of the other comments have stated that they felt this movie left things unexplained....I for one didn't find anything that needed to be explained, I think the movie did a pretty good job in explaining something that is kind of tricky to explain.The Matrix cleverly borrowed from other movies of this genre, i.e., Dark City and Total Recall, and it packaged it quite nicely with astounding special effects....to tell you the truth, I think The Gap commericals were instrumental in the freeze-frame-camera-motion effects.  But, nevertheless, I would watch this movie twice..and to be honest with you, I think the writers made this movie a bit confusing so that people will see it twice, thereby increaseing the net profits of this movie....pretty clever!One last note, If you enjoyed this movie, I suggest you rent Dark City.",10,0,0,16 May 1999
