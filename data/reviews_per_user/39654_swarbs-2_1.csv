Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Best.
","Great action, direction and acting (of course), but I love the fascination of the Ark and it's power and history. Some of my favourite scenes are the ones of Indy in his college, especially that big hall scene. It's probably the best of the three because its the original and without Last Crusade's more silly slapstick.",10,0,0,21 December 2001
