10 Cloverfield Lane," Over rated and fake reviews. Waste of time.
",A hollywood template movie that doesn't do justice to any genre. Looks like the director had no clear picture on how to take the movie forward with such a terrible plot in hand. Thriller/Horror/Sci-Fi is all you experience in the 100 minutes but it leaves you incomplete because of the abrupt genre switch and an absolute half baked story.,2,0,0,28 February 2018

","Avoid this garbage at all cost. Annoying characters, absolutely disgusting cast and easily one of the worst movies ever produced by Hollywood.",1,2,7,6 October 2019
