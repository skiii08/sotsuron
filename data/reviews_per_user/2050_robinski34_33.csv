Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Keep Calm and Carry On, Watson
","After a good, solid first outing by Guy Ritchie featuring excellent cut-and-thrust chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law, and a suitably mysterious and involving plot, I was unsure what to expect from the sequel, but there is no dip in form here, 'A Game of Shadows' is excellent, its canvas is the whole of Europe, Moriarty is on the move and the game is afoot! The action is well-paced, Holmes and Watson's relationship is under strain and darkness and daring abound as a spate of bombings shakes Europe.The introduction of Stephen Fry is inspired; he provides an excellent second foil for Downey Jr. and also a degree of gravitas that was missing before. Noomi Rapace is superbly cast, a pity she was not given more to do, but excellent to see her in a big circulation movie, hopefully more to come. The stand-out performance however is Jared Harris, oh how different from his meek and mild-mannered role as Lane Pryce in 'Mad Men', his Moriarty is superb; not a blustering caricature of evil, thank goodness, but the best kind of villain, a super-intelligent man of strong desires and no morality. The scenes that he shares with Holmes are riveting, none more so than the last one, which is superb cinema.To conclude, despite the very tacky strap line 'A Game of Shadows' IS bigger, it IS better and it IS funnier, but not at the expense of an excellent Gothic action thriller with a tremendous denouement.",9,0,2,15 September 2013
The Prestige," The Mesmerising Mr. Nolan Works His Magic
","The Prestige is another masterful directorial outing for Christopher Nolan who has not put a foot wrong yet. The film is sandwiched between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and serves to once again highlight the wonderful diversity of his work. That he was overlooked for a directorial Oscar nomination for 'Inception' is to the eternal shame of the Academy. The rivalry between Jackman and Bale's characters is loaded with intrigue at every mesmerising twist and turn, and they are supported by a superb cast of characters each presented with an engaging part that the audience cannot fail to invest in. But it is the story that is the true star, brought to life by Nolan, but beautifully imagined by author Christopher Priest. The tricks are all explained but will enthral you nonetheless, as will this excellent film.",10,0,1,3 July 2014
The Expendables," The Incomprehensibles
","The subtitling of a Somali pirate's English in the opening scenes of The Expendables is understandable, it's just a pity that they didn't keep the subtitles going for the other 100 minutes, because a substantial portion of the grunting and growling that passes for dialogue is unintelligible. This would be a problem if anything that was being said was important or required for understanding of the plot, but it isn't, because the plot is a straight line from A to B, entirely one dimensional, so you can fill in the gaps yourself, if you even notice them. On the subject of sound, it is even more uneven than your standard Hollywood blockbuster, but you are not missing much by dialling things down to save your eardrums during the action sequences. There's an amiable buddy-buddy bonhomie running through the script that is enjoyable, and the action well done, and includes the best water plane escape scene since Raiders of the Lost Ark, but overall The Expendables is clichéd and predictable. That's all very well, regrettable, but not objectionable, and it seems clear that this was the film's low-set aspiration anyway, however when you are literally falling asleep during the 'climactic' assault on the evil general's headquarters, I think you can safely say that the film's value as mindless entertainment, it's only real selling point, is limited.",4,2,4,27 September 2013
The Town," My Kind of Town
","Switches from 'seen-it-in-Point-Break' to some genuinely tense moments, and from occasionally jarring accents to some sharp and sassy dialogue. A good cast is headed by an on-form Affleck and an engaging Rebecca Hall, with a solid and likable Jon Hamm, and a suitably on-the-edge-of-control Jeremy Renner – but they are all outshone in his brief moments on screen by a peerless Pete Postlethwaite. It's a good crime drama, not centring on the mechanics of the job, but on the personal relationships that drive events, and that elevates 'The Town' above other crime thrillers of recent years, making it highly watchable.",7,0,0,31 August 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: World Police
","As the Marvel superhero with the richest history, and linch-pin of The Avengers, Captain America was perhaps the most eagerly-awaited of the comic book behemoth's properties to come to the big screen. The First Avenger resoundingly delivered on Cap's pathos, even pulling off the re-branding Chris Evans from hothead Johnny Storm to the steel-nerved Steve Rogers, chief among an across-the-board casting masterclass, from the spunky Hayley Atwell, thru square-jawed Sebastian Stan; gravel-toned Tommy Lee Jones; specky Toby Jones; via fatherly Stanley Tucci; and dashing Dominic Cooper to Hugo Weaving's devilishly evil Red Skull. Joe Johnston's film nicely evoked a never-say-die attitude and drab wartime aesthetic to the benefit of it's jarring final scenes. So how to follow TFA's success? The challenge was to now deal with a contemporary Cap, and directors The Russos (from the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely - who also penned The First Avenger) manage that with aplomb, not laying on the 'this is weird' shtick too thickly, while still reminding us where Cap has come from. But easily the smartest thing that they did was side-stepping the heroic trappings and big CGI (at least until the second half) to adopt the trappings of the political thriller, to great success. Why make a superhero movie at all? Why indeed, and to this end the presence of Robert Redford is a masterstroke. Scarlett Johansson is also on great form and sparks nicely with Chris Evan's Cap, while Sam Jackson's Nick Fury gets more to do in any Marvel appearance so far as the web of lies plays out. We can only hope that Avengers 2 and Cap 3 can bring such a fresh approach.",8,0,1,28 June 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain Courageous
","Woa there, hang on a minute, Chris Evans is Johnny Storm a.k.a. The Human Torch, what the heck is going on here?! Initial concerns are quickly swept aside however since Mr. Evans was clearly born to play the iconic Captain America, whether in initial pint-sized and weedy form, or once transformed as if he's been chiselled out of Mount Rushmore. Great turns from an excellent cast, especially the hard-bitten Tommy Lee Jones; the deliciously frosty Haley Atwell; a gloriously malevolent Hugo Weaving, and the myopically intellectual Toby Jones – and not forgetting excellent work by Dominic Cooper as 'old man' Stark. The film is chock full of glorious rock 'em, sock 'em comic book action, and 'Cap' hits all the nails square on the head, from the frustration of his employment as a War Bond figurehead, to his fearless forays into the heart of enemy territory with his own band of brothers, all present and correct.It's actually quite refreshing to meet a hero who is not flawed, as seems to have become the norm over the decades. Steve Rogers isn't dark, he isn't conflicted, nor is he guilt ridden (yet), he's just out to punch old Adolf in the eye – although as it turns out he has bigger problems to face. The emotional centre of the film is nicely handled, not overplayed, there's a war on after all and duty comes first, but there is still time for some brief, tender moments that add a romantic strand which is nicely played by Atwell and Evans.The toning down of Cap's costume is a wise move and allows the use of a more muted pallet of tones that helps to root the film firmly in the forties, and the production portrays the period beautifully. All this helps to set the film apart from the Marvel fare that we have been served up to date, and adds all the more to the enjoyment of it. One of the greatest pleasures however, as with 'Thor', is the anticipation of something greater, and there is a jarring closing sequence which is very well handled, another promise of things to come. Good, solid, square-jawed fun.",8,0,2,2 August 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Older, More Intelligent (Swedish) Sister
","(I meant the film) To start with I have to eat some words. I said in another review that I wouldn't see this film because I didn't want to tarnish my memory the superlative Swedish original and as a (very) minor protest against the crassness of Hollywood in remaking it, but I did see it after all.It's an excellent cast, even if there are only two Scandinavians (the superb Stellan Skarsgard, and Yorick van Wageningen as Bjurman) among the main players. Daniel Craig is, thankfully, not all action, which would have been inappropriate. Christopher Plummer is faultless as Henrik Vanger, and Steven Berkoff delightfully mysterious as his lawyer Frode. Skarsgard's portrayal of Martin Vanger is also superb, although the character's more subtle traits have been lost between book and script.The inevitable question is how does it compare to the original film? The answer, pluses and minuses. Rooney Mara's performance is excellent, but I found her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander a bit too repressed, almost dispassionate in places, compared to Noomi Rapace's definitive original, and I was not entirely convinced by Yorick van Wageningen's take on Bjurman, although it must be an exceedingly difficult role to play. Craig's Blomkvsit has much to recommend it, but I think he is too dynamic compared to Michael Nykvist's original. As a whole I think Fincher's version is a bit too slick, diluting the sense of dogged investigation that serves the source material better.Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's soundtrack for Fincher's last, 'The Social Network' is note perfect, here I found it invasive to begin with, and although the musical interludes settle down, the soundtrack is close to dominating in places where the drama should have centre stage.All in all I am glad I saw it, it's a great film, but more a remake of Niels Arden Oplev's 2009 screen version than a new adaptation of Stieg Larsson's book, nonetheless well worth seeing if you can handle some violent scenes – but do wait 2 or 3 months then see the original Swedish films too (if you haven't), they are superb.",8,1,5,15 September 2013
The Intouchables," Can't Touch This
","Delightful and surprising drama starring the ever excellent Francois Cluzet and the conquering presence that is Omar Sy. Unlike so many difficult-to-watch and hard-to-love dramas dealing the subject of physical disability, 'Untouchable' handles the subject with a belligerent acceptance that is far more relatable than the worthy wringing of hands that seems to be the standard technique. The direction of the film's writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano is assured, with hardly a missed step, and they explore many interesting and novel ways to cast light on the protagonist Cluzet's difficult situation. Sy is a revelation, a fireball of energy and charm, and both are impossible not to root for straight from the gripping opening sequence. For those who think they don't like 'foreign' films, this would be the perfect introduction.",10,0,0,14 February 2014
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Death Becomes Him
","Rather grim and joyless tale from writer / director Andrew Dominik, starring Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. There are powerful performances from the leads and a talented cast of players, but the real star is Roger Deakins' cinematography, and it is just as well that the film looks and sounds beautiful, because there is little to admire in any of the characters, despite what are clearly skilled performances. No doubt, this can be considered a suitably accurate portrayal, but does it make for rewarding viewing and a positive audience reaction? Setting aside the ability of Hollywood to repeatedly cast gangsters as colourful rogues, or at best, misunderstood or conflicted, rather than the killers and thieves that they are, there is still no-one here to root for, so when this or that character meets his end from time to time, don't be surprised to feel little but an abstract curiosity about the mechanics.As the film rolls on into another hour, even Mr. Deakins' beautiful pictures lose their ability to redeem the unrelieved uniformity of the pacing, and when there is an injection of tension at the promised conclusion, the discovery that this was not the end, but only an end was, for me, a disappointment. It is easy to admire style, but for true enjoyment, there must be substance, conflict, emotion. Where these are attempted by this story, it usually misses the target, and the surfeit of moodiness and brooding disquiet becomes wearing after a while.The script is unremarkable, and few of the cast are given much to do beyond spitting out some western stereotypes in a studied drawl. In the end, it seems reasonable that we take from the piece that the old west was a cruel and dangerous place, with more than its fare share of cruel, dangerous and greedy individuals, unwilling to make their way in the world through honest toil, and unwilling to respect the lives and property of others, but watching them kill each other for 160 minutes, no matter how beautifully filmed, is not an edifying experience.",6,0,1,15 June 2013
Remember the Titans," A Titanic Struggle
","Disney films have a tendency to be laden with schmaltz but Remember the Titans is not overly hampered by that sickly sweetness. There are genuinely uncomfortable scenes in the first half - with pithy dialogue and plenty of confrontation. The lines and sentiments are very clearly drawn. An inspirational performance from the masterful Denzel Washington holds together what is a moving portrayal inspired by real events. Grid-iron fans should find the football scenes, where many such movies fail, reasonably convincing, and the second central relationship between Julius (Wood Harris) and Gerry (Ryan Hurst) is well handled and sensitively portrayed, every bit as convincing as the rivalry between Washington and Will Patton's characters. The second half does become a bit worthy, and sometimes clichéd, treading the same ground as the majority sports movies that have gone before, but Remember the Titans has an advantage over these in that it confronts much bigger issues. Well worth a look.",8,0,1,28 June 2014
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Four Thumbs Up
","Beautifully constructed morality tale from Rupert Wyatt featuring some really remarkable visuals. The effects work and the actors' interactions with their 'props' are so assured that the outcome is convincing to the point that you won't notice the join, and it's a great accomplishment that should deservedly catapult Mr. Wyatt into the big leagues.It's a good if rather predictable story, but satisfying to spot the carefully placed traces of continuity that link to the later (in time-line) phases of the PotA franchise. In the first half at least John Lithgow is the emotional heart of the film and his performance is very touching and effective. James Franco's is a strong turn too, and Freida Pinto provides a strong counterbalance to his character's increasingly reckless pursuit of his scientific goal. It's also good to see Tom Felton casting off his robes and discarding his wand (although just as nasty as ever).In relation to Caesar and the other apes, it is difficult to comprehend the skills that must be necessary to perform effectively with what must be highly invasive technology. Andy Serkis is obviously a skilled actor in his own right, as evinced by his performances as Ian Dury and in The Prestige, Brighton Rock and Little Dorrit (tv) to name a few, but is he really the only guy who can play these marquee motion capture roles? I don't mean to be critical, far from it, I think Mr. Serkis will be remembered as the first and possibly greatest exponent of this newest branch of thespian-ism, but possibly only because of him stepping out from behind the virtual mask and making the transition to 'live action'. It is interesting to consider whether any of Serkis's fellow mocap-ers will ever have the profile that he has deservedly achieved, and if not, why not? In the end, RotPotA is a very enjoyable effects romp, but is best, perhaps unusually, not in its big set pieces but in the personal interactions at the film's heart.All four thumbs up - bring on the Dawn...",8,2,4,31 August 2013
Drive," Far Beyond Driven
","Jaw-dropping piece of cinema from Nicolas Winding Refn, there isn't a weak link in the chain from the top-billed performances of Gosling and Mulligan down to the knuckle-dragging henchmen, everyone brings their A-game. Refn has a unique voice as his previous work (including Bronson and Fear X) ably demonstrates and this must be his strongest outing to date. Gosling's performance is beautifully empty, the epitome of 'spare' while Mulligan effortlessly illuminates the screen, making it impossible to tear ones eyes off her in much the same way as in 'An Education' (or anything else she's been in).These two performances alone would make an excellent film, but it is in the 'supporting' roles that 'Drive' is elevated from a good movie to a definitive piece of modern cinema that will stand out for years to come as a beacon of what can be achieved with total belief in a good project. Ron Perlman and Christina Hendricks know how to captivate an audience. Hendricks owns every one of her scenes in the peerless 'Mad Men' and Perlman is the godfather of the twisted soul, but thankfully is given the chance to play it straight up here and does so to brutal effect, whereas Hendricks delivers a nicely judged if brief appearance transitioning from bravado to a much truer, baser emotion.These four performances are to be expected from the individuals in question, but the standouts are those ones that come from left field. Albert Brooks was for so long the straight man in funny movies but who knew he had this in him. His turn as Bernie Rose is every bit as menacing as De Niro at his best/'worst', but Brooks' foil is possibly even more surprising. Brian Cranston, for so long delivering howlingly funny slapstick comedy as Malcolm's dad, in 'Malcolm in the Middle', turns in a beautifully nuanced performance as Gosling's mentor Shannon. None of the main characters is entirely good or evil, with the probable exception of Mulligan's 'Irene' and Perlman's 'Nino' and it is perhaps that facet that makes 'Drive' as enthralling as it is.'Drive' could be seen as yet another demonstration that so much that is exciting in modern storytelling is coming from Scandinavia, however I think it is actually a vivid illustration that the best cinema comes from the melting pot, with no barrier preventing directors, actors, writers and all the other creative fields from coming together. It's strong stuff in places, but if you can get past that you are in for one of the most memorable films in the last 20 years.",9,2,6,2 August 2013
22 Jump Street," 22 With a Bullet
","Sometimes, after you've transcended the reality of physical existence; experienced two-faced deception from a companion and witnessed a 500 foot monster lay waste to the western seaboard, you're ready to sit down in front of a balls-out comedy and laugh your a** off. Enter 22 Jump Street, the latest somewhat manic creation directed by the somewhat manic Phil Lord and Chris Miller of 21 J.St., Meatballs and Lego fame. There's no rocket science going on here, but the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum carries the film, delivering belly laughs aplenty. The screenplay by Michael Bacal (Scott Pilgrim, Project X, 21 J.St.), Rodney Rothman (Grudge Match) and Oren Uziel is chock full of side references, adopting a heavily meta approach that is not new, but has never been so blatant or effective (staying through the end credits is essential). The script on its own could not carry this, and the 'waffer-thin' plot verges on insulting, but that is not the point of course, it's all about the gags and Hill & Tatum deliver these with gusto as their relationship is put under the spotlight to hilarious effect. Lord & Miller deliver a pacey, punchy film that is just plain funnier than any other comedy this year. It's perhaps a tad baggy in places and suffers slightly from a couple of gags stretching beyond the punch line (you know, that awkward moment of standing looking at each other for an instant), but this never detracts from the whole, which sweeps logic and structure aside in a glorious typhoon of uproarious laughter. Don't analyse this film, just let yourself go.",8,1,5,1 July 2014
Unknown," Where's Liam?
","'Unknown' is a solid espionage thriller with a very good cast and excellent locations in Berlin, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, and preceded by the Spaniard's third film 'Orphan'. Liam is a rock (not The Rock) in the lead, now thoroughly established as a main man in the action movie business, and he has excellent support from Frank Langella, Diane Kruger and January Jones, but it is Bruno Ganz who steals the show in terms of acting chops as a former Stasi officer, indeed the short scene that he shares with Langella is the film's most tense and poignant, superb acting. There's something of the feel of Roman Polanski's 'Frantic' in the perilous pursuit through a European capital, although this is a grittier affair and probably the better for it. Not to be confused with 'Taken' which is a completely different animal.",7,2,2,27 July 2013
Black Hawk Down," Batten the Hatches Down
","What an extraordinary production BHD is, the attention to detail is everything that you would expect from a Ridley Scott film, and is astounding. It's an extensive and interesting cast too, with Sterling work from Eric Bana, William Fitchner and Josh Hartnett; although arguably it is Jason Isaacs (Hello Jason) who has the most to work with in terms of his character. Clearly the groundwork for BHD was laid by the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Thin Red Line', each released three years earlier, and BHD is more of a frenetic onslaught of near-constant combat than either of those game changing war films. It is also the most jingoistic of the three, managing to paint the ill-fated raid in the colours of victory despite the fact that it appears (I admit I'm no expert) to have been misguided and ultimately fruitless, and required the UN to bail the US troops out. In my opinion BHD is every bit as one dimensional as 'The Hurt Locker'. BHD lacks the questioning stance of films like 'Syriana' and 'Body of Lies', although it is a different animal, and being a historical piece BHD perhaps has to be forgiven for that lack. For all its failings BHD remains highly watchable if you are not put off by the constant tinkle of shell cases.",7,0,0,31 August 2013
Super 8," 10 out of 8
","A superlative film from J.J. Abrams, clearly channelling the work of producer the fabulous Mr. Spielberg, Super 8 takes the joyfully freewheeling sensibility of ET and brings a darker more adult tone to a story that borrows several themes from Earth-bound Science Fiction, but Abrams takes these and makes them his own. Hinging the story around the youngsters shooting a movie is a clever and affecting touch, evoking memories of childhood dreams in the audience, and the young stars have a great chemistry that makes the whole premise engrossing. But it would not work so well if the adult performances did not anchor events in the 'real' world of grown-up cares and concerns, and good turns from Kyle Chandler and Ron Elard do just that, especially in the opening scenes where the film's emotional level is established. The youngsters are not upstaged however and the leading lights of the cast-within-a-cast, Joel Courtney, Elle Fanning and Riley Griffiths are entirely believable, but it is Fanning who steals the show in the key train wreck scene, which is fraught with tension and excitement even before the train arrives and, like a certain scene in David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' featuring Naomi Watts, is a highly effective illustration of what proper acting looks like. Super 8 is essential viewing for fans of Abrams, Spielberg or just plain wonderful movies.",10,0,3,22 June 2013
Limitless," The Living End
","Bradley Cooper's character does not evoke much sympathy in the first act, but that is probably the point, he's a rather tiresome nobody, suddenly transformed by the wonder drug that he acquires from his brother-in-law (isn't it always the way). Neil Burger crafts a pacey, good looking film from Leslie Dixon's screenplay from Alan Glynn's novel 'The Dark Fields' stimulating some interesting questions in the viewer, as the best films do. It's an interesting idea, played out with great style and high energy. Cooper's narration is well handled, managing not to annoy, allowing us to concentrate on the action. There are some dizzying visuals that are highly effective, adding to a feeling of freshness. The main characters are all engaging, with good support from Robert de Niro (not stretched), Abbie Cornish, Andrew Howard, and the very watchable Anna Friel. There are perhaps a couple of minor gripes - for one thing, there's a feeling of rampant wish fulfilment about some of the sequences which, even in a fantasy film, seems a bit of a stretch. Also, as any writer knows, blank page syndrome in the very literal way it appears here, is utter nonsense. If you are sitting in front of a blank page in the past clichéd way that Cooper's Eddie Morra does here, you are not a writer, but again, maybe that was the point. This film is well worth seeing, meanwhile, I'm off to the pharmacy.",7,0,0,19 July 2014
Thor," No Thor-prizes
","Pretty straightforward adaptation of the comic book from the House of Marvel, Chris Hemsworth is suitably young, dumb and full of bravado as the Mighty Thor and there is a good performance from Tom Hiddlestone as the scheming Loki. Anthony Hopkins is effortlessly god-like as Odin, but Natalie Portman's role is off-the-shelf action heroine - which she could do in her sleep I'm sure. The presence of Stellan Skarsgard is reassuring as is Clark Gregg's return as Agent Couslon, and a brief cameo by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, the last two being preludes to great things to come (we hope). There is clunkiness to some passages of dialogue, but there are also many nice touches. Asgard is beautifully rendered; the juxtaposition of the different modes of speech works nicely and Stan the Man makes his habitual Hitchcockian appearance. Kenneth Brannagh makes a great job all round including generating a feeling of great distance between Earth and Asgard. The Earth-bound scenes seem narrow in scope, but that's a minor quibble, in the end it's all good comic book fun and whets the appetite for the main event – 98 days and counting!",6,0,1,15 September 2013
The Departed," Infernal Goings-on
","Wonderfully edgy and powerful remake by Martin Scorsese of Wai-keung Lau and Alan Mak's 'Infernal Affairs' (Hong Kong, 2002), an all-star cast is led by Leonardo diCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson, and features Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone and Vera Farmiga. Among a raft of great performances, diCaprio stands out as the severely stressed undercover agent, while Damon reprises something of the supremely cold performance that we saw in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'. Jack Nicholson verges on over-the-top at times, but is good value as the gangland supremo, while Martin Sheen exudes integrity as Captain Queenan. It's a tour de force with some great sequences and plenty of intrigue, and Scorsese is predictably adept at infusing the piece with lashings of slow burning tension. Well worth seeing if you haven't.",8,0,1,27 September 2013
Shooter," Disarming Entertainment
","Shooter comes over as a slick, exciting action movie, Mark Wahlberg gives a strong if largely emotionless performance and Danny Glover is suitably menacing, with Elias Coteas playing his trademark man-on-the-edge-of-sanity. Ned Beatty is deliciously evil as the morally bankrupt man in high place and Michael Pena steals numerous scenes as the unassuming but determined FBI agent. The female roles are, as with so many action films, cardboard cut-outs. The problems start when you break the film down and realise that the message is that shooting people solves the problem, which is, of course, a contemptible message to be peddling. It's too late to rescue America's soul, but the rest of us are hopefully not beyond saving - however movies like this do not help.",4,4,8,28 June 2014
X-Men: First Class," X Marks the Spot
","Take everything that was excellent about the first trilogy and put those ingredients in the hands of someone who knows exactly what they are doing with the comic book genre, then sit back and enjoy the results. Superb entertainment delivered by Matthew Vaughn of Kick-ass fame, directing an engaging and dynamic cast. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are entirely convincing at Xavier and Lehnsherr, and they have strong support throughout a well-constructed story from both A-listers and up-and-coming young stars alike. Jennifer Lawrence is again worthy of great plaudits essaying the troubled Mystique and January Jones is the screen equivalent of super glue to the eyeballs. Kevin Bacon has no trouble convincing as the personification of evil and the action hinges around his hideous masterplan, which is straightforward in its scope, but as usual with X-men it's the personal relationships where most of the real fireworks are flying. Great stuff - essential viewing for hero fans.",8,1,1,2 August 2013
Win Win," Everyone's a Winner Baby
","We really should not be surprised anymore when Paul Giamatti delivers another winning performance in a movie that nobody has heard of, the man is a class act and elicits a heartfelt and tender reaction from his audience, whether he is at the centre of an insightful family drama such as this excellent story from Thomas McCarthy (first time director of the excellent Station Agent) or chewing up the scenery in his cameo in The Hangover Pt.II, where he was a welcome touch of class (and I enjoyed H pt. II). Win Win is every bit as delightfully oddball as Sideways, but places family rather than fraternity at its heart. Young Alex Shaffner's performance is wonderfully low key and makes the film, but it's well played all round and Giamatti is front and centre, and we root for him despite some questionable decisions because we know his heart is in the right place. Gently humorous and engaging from start to finish, highly recommended.",9,1,2,2 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Chris Nolan Rises
","By now it must be irrefutable that Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest film-makers working today, and I would argue till I am blue in the face with anyone who says he has made a single feature that is not a superb example of the film-making art. He can do it all, complex, thought-provoking, exciting, adventurous, heart-rending, challenging, cerebral. He has taken mind-bending art-house conception and made it mainstream with 'Memento', he has taken crime drama and elevated it to art with 'Insomnia', made recording slight of hand an unexpected delight with 'The Prestige', but the greatest trick that he ever pulled, his greatest achievement to date must be his realisation of the cinematic holy grail, the one thing that everyone from the business men to the punters; the technicians to the marketeers; the film buffs to the thespians have been craving for decades, an action trilogy that is good all the way through, an action trilogy that is intelligent, surprising, rewarding and successful. With Batman that is what he has done. Okay, it's not perfect, no film is. In this latest instalment there is still a quibble or two. Bane's voice is annoying. Presumably the queer Dickensian tone was chosen to draw a distinction between it and Bale's gravelly drawl, but there is no obvious rationale for such sub Carry On comic accent. Also, Warner Brothers can expect a class action suit for whiplash after the tirade of cuts in the last 15 minutes, but these are quibbles, when the whole is an audaciously grand construction of a scale dwarfing most blockbusters, beautifully capturing the feel of the Batman stories, and not drenching them in stultifying darkness as has been done before, but having the courage to shine a light on the man behind the mask. Because Nolan knows that a blockbuster is just a big empty shell if it is not peopled by living breathing characters. They are here in abundance, and it is the very personal loves, friendships, rivalries and hatreds between them that drive the movie, that fill Nolan's magnificent construction with life. And in the end it all pays off, the huge set pieces, the fights, the flashbacks, the feisty dialogue, the human relationships, every element is resolved, tied up and presented to the viewer with a big bow on it. Nolan knows what we want, he knows how to present it to us, and he provides it to us in spades - satisfaction.",9,3,7,15 September 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Moonrise Serenade
","At first 'Moonrise Kingdom' seems to try too hard to be eccentric and often has a very stagey quality, no doubt deliberately, which characteristics mark it unmistakably as the work of Wes Anderson. There are a couple of moments in the third act that stretch the audience's willing credulity, but it would be a heartless viewer who was not willing to forgive these flights of fancy, which highlight the film's fairy-tale quality, reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands or The Truman Show, and are consistent with the Am-Dram sensibility running through it. The film's greatest strength is a heart of pure gold, a delightful melding of the innocence and earnest enthusiasm of Arthur Ransom's 'Swallows and Amazons' with the sassy grit and knowing irreverence of Tarantino's 'True Romance'. The central relationship is delightful, his-and-hers quirks and skewed affectations of adulthood, not in the least annoying (which is an achievement), a tribute to the work put in by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward in the central roles. Edward Norton is outstanding (we expect no less) and Bruce Willis' turn is nicely understated. Tilda Swinton is also a standout, and thankfully used sparingly, otherwise her character would have overpowered the gentler souls around her. Other Anderson stalwarts are also present, including stalwart-in-chief, Bill Murray, and erstwhile leading lad Jason Schwartzman. At only 94 minutes, it's tempting to expect that the film would feel lightweight, but the arc of the story is well served by the film's compactness, and by the time it reaches the end there is nothing left unsaid. Moonrise Kingdom deserves to be considered among Wes Anderson's finest work, and there are plenty of characters here to root for. Hooray for Uncle Wes!

Godzilla," Everything is Awesome
","With his first Monsters, Gareth Edwards proved that he is a capable and inventive film-maker, and it was very pleasing to see Hollywood recognise this so quickly and give him a shot at a major motion picture so early in his career. Edwards has rewarded that confidence by bringing all the skills apparent in his guerrilla debut to a very large property indeed, and making a highly accomplished and enjoyable film. Godzilla has, of course, seen numerous interpretations over the years, but Edwards' take is still fresh. He recognises that the human aspect is how the audience relates to the film and its hero, and there is no better actor working today at carrying the audience's empathy than Bryan Cranston, whose presence and performance ensures that the viewer is on board. The relationship conveyed by Cranston and Juliett Binoche in a few short minutes of screen time is immediately convincing and provides an emotional platform for the film. It's a pity that Aaron Taylor-Johnson does not seem capable of taking this emotion forward, and his stock action protagonist and relationship with his doctor wife Elizabeth Olsen is the most disappointing aspect of the film. Thankfully, we need not dwell on this, as the main event is Edwards' highly effective handling of the monsters. Their design is excellent, clearly the subject of careful consideration, but Edward's peerless talent is in his recognition that these creatures are governed by the same biological imperatives as humans - eat, reproduce and compete. The Mutos' laying waste to human cities is just a by-product of this,. It is the key to the film's success, and the reason Godzilla deserves to be seen, as much for the monstrous performances as the human ones.",9,2,6,29 June 2014
Looper," In The Loop
","Enjoyable SF effort from emerging auteur Rian Johnson, writer and director of the excellent 'Brick' and the very good (but not excellent) 'Brothers Bloom', 'Looper' is a challenging time-travel yarn, which finds Joseph Gordon-Levitt trying to unpick the tangled plot strands that run through what is a stylish future thriller. The make-up work to alter JGL and make him more Willis-like is remarkably good, and there's a functional matter-of-factness about the technology of the future that makes it easy to accept, a believable near(ish)-future, and the whole thing looks wonderful thanks to DP Steve Yedlin. But 'Looper' is not without issues. Being told more than once not to think about the implications of time travel felt patronising, even when it is the very excellent Jeff Daniels doing the telling - and Mr. J. could have done a lot worse than take a leaf out of the book of the superlative 'Primer' (find it, watch it) and Shane Carruth in that regard. It all goes a bit 'Witness' in the third act, but there is sufficient chemistry between Emily Blunt and JGL that the tension is maintained, and the climax is impactful and highly satisfying. What higher recommendation can there be for Mr. Johnson's abilities than the fact that he has delivered three episodes of the seminal 'Breaking Bad'? We should be awaiting his next project with bated breath.",7,1,3,6 September 2013
Cloud Atlas," The Weight of the World
","Cloud Atlas is an audacious avalanche of ideas that it took three directors to deliver. Arguably overlong and of uneven tone, perhaps the film's greatest strength is that it begs the question 'Is it not more important to have ideas than to have successful ideas.' Then again, it is too easy to dismiss novel projects in this vein as being over-complicated when they should be lauded for taking the risk to attempt something different. As ever, Tom Hanks hardly puts a foot wrong in what seem to be the most testing of roles, and Halle Berry is equally effective in convincing the viewer to swallow some huge conceits. Jims Sturgess and Broadbent appear comfortable with the tall notions that abound, and there are equally effective turns from Ben Wishaw, James D'Arcy and Hugo Weaving, who always looks like he is having tremendous fun. Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, Keith David and David Gyasi also deserve a mention for their significant contribution, but it's hard to argue against Doona Bae being at the film's heart, her performance in the futuristic Neo Seoul capturing fragility while showing strength, and displaying both dignity and determination. Bae and Sturgess deliver as many emotional scenes as Hanks and Berry, and deserve high praise for it. Viewing Cloud Atlas, I would argue that, in cinema, the end is not necessarily to present a coherent outcome, but to generate contemplation of what the outcome might be, or of the path followed to reach it. In the end, Cloud Atlas could be seen as being failing under the weight of too many cinematic genres, with the comic strand in particular tending to jar against the drama and tension around it, but the writers and directors are to be commended for attempting such an ambitious project, that delivers much in the way of thoughtful cinema and compelling performance. Multiple viewings seem bound to reveal more dimensions.",7,3,5,8 June 2014
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Pitt / Slater
","Before there was True Blood; before there was Twilight; before Buffy, Angel and Vampire Diaries (pah!), there was Interview with the Vampire. An excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's first novel, Tom Cruise's 'Lestat' leaps off the page in all his pomp and swagger. Pitt's 'Louis' is the ideal foil, righteous and idealistic, their partnership melded by Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia' – a terrific performance at the age of twelve.Neil Jordan has a good cast and employs them all well, brilliantly capturing the scope of the story and the essence of its characters. The soundtrack also deserves star billing, a spellbinding collection by Elliot Goldenthal that captures not only the action, but the locations and the era.To me the cleverest layer in Rice's story, from which she adapted the screenplay herself, is the commentary on the inability of some vampires to change with the times, ably highlighted in the closing scenes and the final moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, one of my favourite uses of popular music in film, and so very, very right for that wonderful closing line reprise. There is beauty and ugliness in equal measure, and a grand sweep of storyline that beautifully captures the span of time and the weight of years, the excitement and the ennui.Interview... is a great watch, a thrilling journey full of anguish and melancholy, glamour and guts – showing that vampires are by no means the 'youthful', glossy, beautiful creatures that the networks and studios now want you to believe for the purposes of prime-time. So many 80's movies do not stand the test of time, but this is one that will never grow old – a must for your list if you have never seen it.",8,0,0,15 September 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," If You Go Down To The Woods Today...
","Set expectations to 'stun' (not stunning) for this not particularly scary, but interesting effort. I'm not a big horror fan, so I'm not sure if this is post-Scream or post-post-Scream post-found-footage, but it's an entertaining enough film with a twist at the start that runs through it. The proceedings are unremarkable, although there are decent turns from the leads. Chris Hemsworth is convincing as the ubiquitous jock, and Kristen Connolly is engaging as the heroine in peril, but it's the underlying premise and the presence of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford that will prevent you from turning off after the first fifteen minutes. And for me the story does offer something in addition to the usual tired horror clichés, even if the payoff is disappointing, not least down to the introduction of the CGI equivalent of claymation and polystyrene. You should be entertained, somewhat, if you are willing to go along for the ride.",Null,0,2,22 June 2013
The Runaways," Life In The Fast Lane
","The Runaways is an entertaining story of the rise and fall of the eponymous band, with good lead performances by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning as the mainstays of the group, Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. The story itself is a familiar one, no less so because it is probably largely true of the arc of many rock bands, an arc lampooned brilliantly by This is... Spinal Tap, and you will see comparisons between this film and that comic fiction, but what Christopher Guest did not stretch the limits of his fiction to are the wild-eyed antics of crack-pot impresario Kim Fowley, brilliantly played by Michael Shannon. Among the many fresh faces on show is an older one who was the child protégé of her day, Tatum O'Neal (ask your mum), daughter of Ryan O'Neal (ask your gran), as Cherie's mother. Enjoyable stuff, if not exactly family fayre, and definitely not one to watch with your 16 year old daughter (eeuw!).",7,2,4,28 June 2013
The Social Network," 'The New Socialism'
","Have you ever wondered what a collaboration between all your favourite creative people would look and sound like? To be honest I had not - it's such an improbable event, the chances of such a thing happening are so remote, that it's not even worth thinking about... (Roll VT)...I am sitting in the superb Grosvenor Cinema in Glasgow's West End about to enjoy the latest offering from David Fincher, 'The Social Network'. I know that it is scripted by Aaron Sorkin - he of West Wing fame - either one is a strong recommendation on its own, but both together bodes very well indeed, I am anticipating eagerly. Trigger Street Productions - ah, an unexpected bonus, my favourite actor of the 90's (and probably the other decades too) Kevin Spacey (Glengarry Glen Ross (92), Swimming With Sharks (94), Se7en (95), Usual Suspects (95), LA Confidential (97), American Beauty (99) - an incomparable body of work in such a short period) has produced, truly a stamp of quality.Even now a full house has not even entered my head, and then the opening bars of the soundtrack creep from the speakers as the camera tracks up the stairs, only the first handful of notes are required, it's only Trent flaming Reznor who's written the soundtrack, prophet of an alternative generation and my touchstone for musical inspiration. Right from the opening lines you have to run to keep up. Sorkin's dialogue is as snappy and intelligent as the West Wing or Studio 60 ever were, it's nasty, smug, angry when it needs to be, but always, always, very, very clever. Who do you pick to write a script about a computer 'genius'? A scriptwriting genius of course.The central performances are all good, Jesse Eisenberg in particular as the anti-hero Zuckerberg, excellently portrays a detached and somewhat bemused persona that I would imagine most computer 'geniuses' have, while Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake provide excellent foils for our 'hero's' single-minded petulance. The protagonists all have their faults and none of the characters elicited any sympathy in me. That's usually a cue to switch off, but 'The Social Network' transcends the characters and the plot, which is largely irrelevant, in the sense that we all know how the story ends (to this point at least). But the script holds everything together and I found it impossible to take my eyes off the screen.On paper this is a turkey, a movie about an Internet billionaire and the contractual and legal fog that surrounded his success? It could not be a better example of what true genius can deliver to the screen. As a child, like most children, I used to think that the actors did all the work, and I wondered who all the other people in the credits were - if ever there was a lesson in how naive that childish view is it in the team that brought us 'The Social Network'.",10,1,1,9 June 2014
Princess Mononoke," King of the World
","Princess Mononoke is a delightful anime from the man who has come to define everything that is best about the genre, arguably, this was Hayao Miyazaki's calling card to the world outside Japan. The English voice cast boasts Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Jada Pinkett Smith, Gillan Anderson and Keith David - a considerable volume of talent for an animation back in 1997 (Toy Story was 1995), arguably marking the beginning of another trend - for big names to be heard and not seen. There are familiar anime tropes here, but all handled with such sensitivity and style that they still feel fresh on viewing today. The theme of environmentalism is strong, but not stereotyped - character motivations going far beyond cardboard cut-out in their complexity, and it is refreshing and enjoyable that Miyazaki finds room for nobility and honour in his protagonists given the present penchant for anti-heroism. Cinema is the poorer for the recent news that Miyazaki has retired at the age of 73. Here's hoping that the art of animation and of film-making properly acknowledge the debt that it owes him.",9,0,1,8 June 2014
Up in the Air," Turning Things Downside Up
","Up In The Air is a highly enjoyable and thought-provoking drama starring George Clooney and Vera Farmiga. Clooney's corporate 'hit-man' is gloriously uncaring, but still exudes charisma in a way that is difficult to take one's eyes off. Clooney's chemistry with Anna Kendrick's character is very entertaining, and the corporate (and personal) carnage that they wreak, while wince-inducing, is inventively captured by Jason Reitman through the device of talking heads. This is a superb follow-up by Reitman to the excellent 'Juno' , almost looking at the opposite end of the human condition for its inspiration, it should send you off to look for Reitman's other films 'Thank You For Smoking' and 'Young Adult'. There are clever and thoughtful twists in the third act; it is ultimately a very satisfying and enjoyable film that should leave you with something to think about if you are on a professional career path.",9,0,1,21 June 2014
