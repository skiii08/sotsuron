Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A most imaginative film.
","'Episode One' is possibly the best out of the four Star Wars movies todate. Of course, one cannot resurrect the freshness one felt at seeing 'A New Hope' for the first time, but the film  radiates the fact that (for the first time) Geroge Lucas is able to actually put on the screen what resides within his imagination.This film is responsible for setting the stage for the moral battles to come, and it does so beautifully.  The world of 'Episode One' is populated with exotic cities, grasping trade federations, and noble aliens (the Gungans) who fight to save their culture and that of the Naboo.The movie is worth seeing over and over again for its rich visual effects, its excellent sound design, and for fight sequences that are amazing to behold.
Go see it.  It's a must.",10,0,0,31 May 1999

Ratatouille," Possibly the best Animated Film Made to Date
","and certainly on a par with the best from Myazaki and Classic Disney. The Academy should think out of the box this year and nominate this film, in addition to Best Animated Film, for awards in Sound and Sound Effects Editing (perfect balance and amazing Foley), Best Score, Best Cinematography (Brad Bird actually has a cinematographer on his animated films, even though there's no 'photography' involved), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing.If you haven't seen it yet, seek out a theater and do so. If you read this after it's left the theaters, definitely buy the DVD or Blu-Ray disc.",10,0,1,6 September 2007
