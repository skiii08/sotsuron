United 93," One of the best movies ever made
","I saw Paul Greengrass's 'Bloody Sunday' and was very impressed. However when a movie that dealt with America's most horrible day was going to be directed by him, I got very nervous. I didn't feel that he was the best to direct this movie. Oliver Stone or Steven Spielberg seemed like better candidates instead. However when Greengrass's documentary style of filming was used it created such an unsettling mood, which only added to this great drama. The acting was incredible and actually, some of the actors in this film were actually portraying themselves on 9/11. I can't begin to visualize how much pre-planning Greengrass had for this movie. Every shot is perfect. This movie, might be a modern classic. I feel it has its moments that rival films as dramatic as Schindler's List. In short, this movie is destined to become a classic, and is one of the best movies ever made. This movie will be a definite Oscar contender this year and if it is not, I will be very disappointed. I also sense a definite Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Ensemble for this movie.",10,2,5,6 August 2006
