Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Just amazing!
",Really really amazing. I think this movie is really underrated. Incredible casting choices; RDJ and Jude Law played they roles perfect. Story is good and Guy Ritchie did it again in his own twisted way. It's really amuses you and it's quality cinema at the same time. I hope we get a third one. But for this one all I want to say it is brillant.,10,3,5,31 October 2019
