Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I really enjoyed 'Phantom Menace' and I plan to see it again.
","I thoroughly enjoyed 'Phantom Menace' even though I am not what you might call a 'Star Wars Person'.  I went to see it just because everyone else was, but I was pleasantly surprised by the whole movie.  The acting was great and the story was very interesting, especially having seen the original 'Star Wars'.",10,0,0,25 May 1999
