Marie Antoinette," Vanity Project?
","This movie seems to be a fictional romp wherein Kirsten Dunst gets to play the beautiful, legendary and seemingly vacuous Marie Antoinette. The story portrays her personal trials and tribulations and yet, never points out the horrendous social crime she is committing by living the imperial high life. France as a whole was stewing in desperate poverty and starvation. The intolerable living conditions eventually result in a revolt and creation of a nation of iron democrats. This story and the French relationship with the about to be created United States is a fantastic and sadly, in this film, an untold story. I found the lame plot that was the film to be boring and lacking in any characters I could relate to or be interested in.",2,3,6,9 November 2006
