Ghost," A movie that can't make its mind up what to be
","I went into watching Ghost thinking it would be just a soppy romantic fantasy drama. I was wrong. It offered so much more. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver.I was confused by which direction the movie wanted to go. It fell between too many stools. At one point it tries to be all out, serious romance, then thriller, then fantasy comedy then slapstick comedy. It fails to nail any of these sub-genres and ends slightly messy.For a film that tries so hard to get you to accept Swayze walking round as a ghost, it fails to convince in many other areas such as: are we really meant to believe Swayze's best friend would get him bumped off just for money? Plus, was there supposed to be mystery around who was behind his killing? Let's look at the characters we've been introduced to so far; Sam, Molly and Sam's friend....well, it doesn't exactly take Sherlock Holmes to deduce who it is! The execution of the whole plot line with Carl getting Sam killed is so poor I feel it lets the whole film down. The special effects in the film also sail close to the wind. They are particularly poor with the demons who come to take bad people down to hell. These black blobs with their wailing are more comical than frightening.The character of Carl is a curious one indeed. Waivering between a total wimp and a would-be killer, it just becomes a muddled study of someone who never really gives much resonance his role in proceedings.And as for some great love story? It's OK, but for more than half the film Sam can't really interact with Molly, just through Oda Mae, which is just too madcap to be taken seriously. Goldberg, as with Swayze and Moore, delivers a competent performance but no more than that.After viewing this film I am bemused that it is held in such distinct regard some 17 years on. A decent film elevated to something it isn't and is ultimately a letdown.Shame.",6,2,7,5 November 2007
The Ring," Solid start, poor middle, good end!
","**********POSSIBLE SPOILERS***********
This movie has one of the best chiller openings since 'Scream' (1996). We then get to see the infamous tape which is a supposed death sentence to all who watch. The imagery on it is truly bizarre and quite disturbing. Just like a nightmare. The cinematography is so saturated the movie feels like it's all abit of a dream (don't worry, it isn't, it's not like they all wake up at the end or anything). The main actors play there roles well, and I must say the Naomi Watts is damn attractive! The little kid looks freaky and is perhaps too much of a Hayley Joel Osment clone. He's still good though. Anyway, I digress. Be prepared to jump out of your skin a few times too....aswell as having your skin crawl. This is a very strange film that will clench your nerves. Be warned though, if you're expecting a more teen orientated stalk and death movie as I was from the trailer, prepare for disappointment. This is more 6th Sense than it is Final Destination.
HOWEVER, we get to the middle chunk of the movie and we have this rather slow and utterly confusing investigation into the tape and who's on it etc etc. This was over an hour and the film became very stagnated. I began to get bored because no matter what new information was uncovered, I still couldn't understand alot of things. Such as; who made the blooming tape? What was so wrong with the girl that she brought trouble wherever she goes? Why was the well actually nowhere near the island yet horses were running around near there? Why were the girl and her mother there? The cabin had been built over the well, but that cabin looked more than 24 years old. How in the name of God did the little boy know about the girl down the well? And why did she keep on killing in the same style after she had been 'set free. These bewildering questions prevent this movie from being anything above a 3 star movie. I was scared during it though, and the images of the girl coming out of the well will haunt me for a while yet. The ending is good but drags on abit. Just as you expect to see the credits, another scene is played out, then another, then another..........so much you just want it to end. The Alternate Versions illustrated on the Imdb would have been interesting additions, and I don't think we will get to see them on the DVD which is a bummer! Nevermind.Anyway, watch this movie. I recommend it. But prepare to have your brain melted thinking about it afterwards. If anyone reads this and can explain the plot-holes I outlined, feel free to e-mail me and set me straight. Thanks, adios amigos.",Null,0,0,16 February 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Greatest Movie of them all
","Films, movies, motion pictures...whatever you want to call them, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the best.Indiana Jones is the iconic hero of every generation; rough, tough and always on the good side. Played by Harrison Ford, we have the perfect match as he is the iconic, square-jawed actor of every generation.This is what movies are all about; ballsy action, exotic locations and more cliffhanging close shaves then you can crack a whip at. When you look up the term movie in the Oxford English Dictionary it should read;Movie: See Steven Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'...RIGHT NOW!Who wants emotional schmaltz fests, dizzy romantic comedies, complex sci-fi gobbledygook, kiddy pleasing animation features and laborious 4 hour epics when you can have a 2 hour gun slinging, boulder avoiding, horse riding, snake dodging, Ark retrieving, Nazi fleeing, death defying cliffhanging Hollywood EXTRAVANGANZA!!!!!!!To say Raiders is 'basic' seems abit flippant. But that's what it is. Back to basics in the most powerful way possible.How could it go wrong anyway? You have the two genius filmmakers of the 70's and 80's in Spielberg and Lucas carefully crafting an audacious adventure flick. It was a nailed on success. In their 90's and 00's moods though, it is highly doubtful they would have made the picture as good as this. But that debate is for another time.Oh and yeah, it has a score by John Williams, the most gifted movie composer of them all. As he did with Superman and Star Wars, he elevates 'Raiders' to more than just a movie. It's a truly awe-inspiring experience that grabs hold of you and stays with you long after the end credits have rolled.Spielberg, Lucas and Williams. The dream makers of the late 20th Century really do make your wildest fantasies come true in Raiders of the Lost Ark.See it now, then again and again. You will never be disappointed.",10,0,0,12 July 2003
Heat," A movie that deserves to be labelled 'MODERN CLASSIC'
","I have watched this movie for the first time since I initially reviewed it in September 2003. Back then I lambasted it for being too long and not answering enough questions, accused the two leads of over-acting and put down the achievements of director Michael Mann amongst other gripes.Now though, I have to say my opinion has changed tremendously. This is a truly outstanding film. A great take on the tried, tested and sometimes boring genre of heist movies.In my original review I stated that Robert DeNiro was easily out-acted by Al Pacino. I still maintain that Pacino is the better of the two, but I reckon DeNiro is pretty spectacular as the main villain.The great thing about this movie is the way in which it portrays the characters as real people with real problems. Pacino is the steadfast, no-nonsense cop with his finger on the pulse, but has a crumbling marriage and suicidal step-daughter to pre-occupy his supposed 'free' time, DeNiro is the compulsive criminal who wants to get away from crime and set up a new life with the woman he loves. But the inescapable fact for these two is that no matter what criminal they arrest or what crime they commit, their working life will never, ever be truly satisfying. Mann plays the characters off brilliantly as two sides of the same coin, each with partners who try but will never fully understand the life they lead away from home. Pacino just wants his wife to be there for him, but she places demands on him that are too much for him to shoulder after a countless bad days at the office.Whether you are watching a heist or witnessing DeNiro and Pacino having a late-night coffee, the scenes in this film bristle with superb underlying tension; great credit to Mann there. The scene wherein Pacino and his men are carrying out surveillance on DeNiro and Kilmer from the back of a truck is excellent; with hardly any movement from the characters or much dialogue, the tension cranks up ten-fold.Everything about this film, from the sets to the actors, oozes class. An absolutely superb cast fill each and every role with well defined persona's and you actually care about all of them.***************SPOILER*************** I still do have a gripe with the fact that Kilmer got away, why was he so special? **************END SPOILER************* One of the great films of the 1990's, Heat deserves branding as a modern classic.",Null,0,2,13 June 2005
Heat," Good...not great
","********************SPOLIERS**********************************
Ok, this is a good movie. But that's where the praise ends. It ain't great. In fact, it's seriously flawed. Mann obviously couldn't harness DeNiro and Pacino, and as a result you often feel they take over way too much.And what's with them 'holding' hands at the end. It's almost as if Mann daren't show DeNiro to be all that bad. Or couldn't have Pacino to seem to be so much better than him.Also, what the hell happened to Val Kilmer?! He just got away? To say the film is 2 hours 45mins, it sure as heck leaves alot of stuff unexplained.Anyway, the much hyped DeNiro vs Pacino match is easily won by the masterful Pacino. He just kicks DeNiro all over the place in the acting stakes. Truly superb actor.",Null,0,1,7 September 2003
