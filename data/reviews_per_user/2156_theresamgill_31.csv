Skyfall," Not just the best Craig Bond film, this is the best Bond film ever. Period.
","This is truly the pinnacle of Bond films. Although perhaps not the best opening action sequence overall, it succeeds in introducing the tone of the film-- one that fits perfectly with the narrative. It also introduces Naomie Harris who is a welcome addition to this revamped cast. And maybe the animation sequence doesn't tell the best story, but it's so clever, and when matched with Adele's titular song, it is definitely the best theme.Early on Daniel Craig briefly sports a scruffy look. He doesn't come close to passing the physical. The psychological examination is clever. All of this and more builds on the approach Sam Mendes beautifully takes this film. And it's all backed behind a stellar cast. Ben Whishaw plays one of my favorite (if not favorite actually) characters in the young and arrogant techno Q, and of course adding Ralph Fiennes into the mix is awesome. This also marks the best narrative given to Judi Dench as the aging M (although give Judi Dench credit because she looks great for however many decades old she is).If you didn't know it was coming, I had to save Javier Bardem for last. He is a powerhouse actor who became familiar to American audiences with his villainous turn in No Country for Old Men (I'd describe his character as the combination of Joker and Two Face from The Dark Knight). Also shout out to his starring role in Alejandro Inarritu's foreign film Biutiful. And if you need any more evidence of his quality acting, look no further than his malignant and sophisticated role in this film. His introduction and monologue is memorable, his actions are remorseless, and unlike Christoph Waltz's antagonist in the sequel, the execution of his plan is smart and scary. Easily the best villain of this series.Something I haven't really discussed much from the other films but that is so vital to the success of this film is the cinematography. The film lost out to Life of Pi at the Oscars, but the shots of Shanghai-- in particular the silent action scene in the skyscraper is one of my favorites of any film-- are such a gorgeous combination of colors bursting from the dark surroundings (hmm, even a bit like the tone of the film).This movie is the perfect blend of old and new Bond. Throw on top a great character-driven story, and not only is this my favorite film of Daniel Craig's series, it's my favorite Bond film (admittedly, I need to re-watch many of the classics, especially with Sean Connery). And not only is it my favorite Bond film, it's just a tremendous film on its own. Multiple scenes always pop out as memorable, and the climax is simply fantastic. Even if you haven't seen Casino Royale, or any Bond film for that matter, I can't stress enough that to anybody and everybody I give a high recommendation to go watch Skyfall.

Deepwater Horizon," Well-executed, thrilling, and a true story
","Don't be confused: above all else, Deepwater Horizon is a disaster film. Unsuspecting characters mingle harmlessly and provide exposition about themselves and their surroundings to allow a second-half non-stop action fest. There are movies that follow the formula conventionally and do a good job at it, others do a poor job at it, and even some others try putting a twist on the formula. This film-for the most part-is successful. For a clear disaster film, what works the most is actually the beginning. It takes awhile for the action to start happening, so this means we have to care about the characters so that we're worried about their fates when death closes in in the second half. The writing is solid and engaging, Wahlberg has chemistry with everyone, and Kurt Russell brings the soul and spirit into the film. John Malkovich plays a rather conventional white collar antagonist, but needless to say, the buildup for the inevitable is really well done. If you've been living under a rock for the past decade, I'll quickly explain the point of this film. In 2010 an offshore oil rig exploded and resulted in the worst oil spill in U.S. history. This is the story of the workers on-board when it happened, and how pressure from executives to meet deadlines and cut costs ultimately led to the explosions that tragically killed and injured too many. The set for the film is basically the biggest ever used in a film, and it certainly adds to the film. There are plenty of shots of ordinary workers doing their job when mud and oil rumbles and rumbles until it finally blows. And it's presented without holding back. This is a very strong PG-13 film as you watch workers blown back, saved by their helmets; they desperately try containing the oil that blocks their vision and slips them up. I'm simplifying the action and don't want to describe everything that goes on, but trust me when I say that this film is engaging from start to finish. The climax was predictable, and therefore lacked some tension, but your heart will race as you root for the characters you spent the first half of the film getting to know. The movie won't revolutionize anything, but that doesn't have to stop it from being a solid film. It's a disaster film you will enjoy watching, only amplified by the well-known fallout that took place afterward. It's a testament to tell the story of real people in an unbelievably traumatizing situation, and for executing it with confidence and poise, I applaud the filmmakers and their efforts.

John Wick," Just Straight Up Some of the Coolest Action
","Keanu Reeves will always be known for The Matrix, and this movie reunites him with his stunt double from those films who takes a shot in the director's chair. The film basically has 2 directors (and one is scheduled to direct Deadpool 2 so there's that), and since both come from a background of doing stunts from dozens of your favorite action movies, this film gets boiled down to its essence. They aren't going to try wowing you with a special plot; no, they're going to deliver high-octane action. And really it's quite successful. Keanu did some major training for the highly choreographed scenes and performs most of his own stunts, and the result pays off. Expect a high body count, and expect many of them to have some really cool kill shots. This film knows its goal is to entertain with cool, quick action, and that's exactly what it does. I will say, however, one of the best and worst parts comes from the beginning. The film honestly almost takes an Up approach of giving the audience all the exposition it needs in a small time without much dialogue at all. And I love that. But it-along with just a few action moments-gets heavy-handed. Like at one point Keanu is grabbing all his guns and gearing up, and the movie blares a rocking song about guns and killing and it feels a bit too obvious. I wasn't going to talk about the plot because, well, who cares for this film, but it leads to my other critique. The film gets a nice supporting role from Willem Dafoe and gives way too little screen time to John Leguizamo, but the plot gets going after a mob boss's son steals from John Wick and leaves him for dead. This son, Iosef, is annoyingly stereotypical. He's brash, arrogant, and above all else, completely inept. He fits the bill of all the stereotypes, and it just makes you wonder how long it will take John Keanu Reeves Wick to hunt him down. It's been awhile since an action film has had this much style to it. It overcomes typical shortcomings by thoroughly delivering in well-executed action scenes.

Chinatown," The Pinnacle of how to Write a Great Script
","What we have here today is truly a powerhouse of a film. Chinatown is a drama about a private investigator Jake (Jack Nicholson) who gets hired by a Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) because she believes her husband is having an affair. Jake quickly gets to work, but when Mr. Mulwray turns up dead and Evelyn not possibly actually being Evelyn, the movie starts messing with you in the best possible way. Before I discuss anything further, I have to talk about the script. It's truly amazing just how good the writing is. It kills me not to discuss any spoilers, and I won't, but you learn just the right amount of details from every scene as the depth to the complexity of the story and the characters slowly unwinds in metaphorical wonder. If there aren't classes that already do this, then scriptwriting classes should always point to this movie when discussing how to essentially write a perfect script. No joke, as experienced of a writer I am, this script is almost as well-written as these reviews. Anyways, Roman Polanski directs this film, and one of his most notable contributions is the tone. The dude had a rough past, especially with where they shot the film, and admittedly this is a formula that does not equal out to a rainbow and smiles kind of movie. And this has got to be the most normal character Jack Nicholson has ever played, and the best thing to say is that it's just a joy to watch an actor take the protagonist and make it his own. The supporting cast shines-I shouldn't even have to say it, but this obviously includes the brilliantly complex performance from Faye Dunaway. Obviously, the most famous line is the one I reference in the title; however, that's not actually my favorite line of the film. What's so much fun is that I actually can't tell you what it is because it'd be too much of a spoiler, so all I will say is that the line is a big reveal I did not by any means expect in the latter half of the movie. It's some deep subject matter, and I say with a smirk that you have to watch the film to understand what I'm talking about. I understand that some movies I review and recommend will not exactly put you in a good mood after watching them... And yeah, this movie isn't different. But if you're prepared for a slow-burner that will shock and entertain you (but not put a smile on your face), then watch Chinatown. Well, that's all from me.

Wind River," Overall, pretty good
","'We have to drive 50 miles to go 5. Welcome to Wyoming.' Not only is this a cool line of dialogue, but I believe it perfectly captures how much the land and the environment affect the story, pacing, and tone of Wind River. The movie starts with a girl running panicked through the wintery woods before collapsing in the night. She is then discovered frozen by Jeremy Renner, a trained tracker who knows his ways around these parts and with these people-even if he is a white outsider. It's obvious he has some sort of troubled past that hunches on his back despite his efforts to push forward. This mysterious past motivates him to help the young FBI agent Elizabeth Olsen with the case; and coming straight from Las Vegas, it's obvious that she needs the help of a local. The movie has ominous undertones of the dark side of humanity sprinkled within the glistening snow of the beautiful landscape. The serious, almost straight-forward approach to the simplistic story kept reminding me of Sicario, and I didn't realize until afterward that it's the same writer. This writer Taylor Sheridan, who previously was lauded for both Sicario and Hell or High Water, both writes and directs for this film. He's definitely imitating aspects from Denis Villeneuve, and if there's a director to imitate, he's one of the best choices. With that said, I think the production, editing, score, and cinematography are all ultimately better than the decent directing. On the surface the film is about a murder investigation on an Indian reservation with an FBI agent receiving help from a skilled tracker/hunter. And except a nice turn from Jon Bernthal, there's nothing really surprising here. Some shocking moments, but nothing surprising. But that's rightfully not the focus of the film. And neither are the decently developed characters. Wyoming takes the starring role here. There's enough snow in sight to freeze a polar bear, and despite how little that analogy may make sense, it's true. And it's used to full effect with blistering wide shots mixed with shivering closeups of the characters. The setting is an obstacle, a visual splendor, a kickstarter for the right moments in the plot, and an underlying motivation. Without Wyoming, this movie is nowhere near the same. As much as I praise the setting for this film, you do still have to knock the film a bit for the story. The unflinching storytelling-almost reminiscent of Prisoners-will work for some, and may be a slight turnoff for others looking for a more upbeat movie. That's not really the issue. Olsen and Renner run into new characters, potential suspects even, and it's pretty easy to tell from the get-go how all these encounters are going to go. To keep with the Prisoners comparison, there's no Jake Gyllenhaal to do detective work here. And to Taylor Sheridan's credit, he plays up the mood, setting, and characters to focus on them because he can't rely on a plot twist filled story to keep the audience engaged. This film really does try to replicate a lot of the successful tension built in Sicario. It works to some degree, and the filmmakers do an admirable job trying to coverup any other shortcomings this film has. It's not the best film, and it certainly isn't a joyous film, but if you're trying to think of something to watch, this is a better choice than plenty of other movies. Heck, it definitely won't put you in a merry spirit, but it's got plenty of snow to be a movie to watch over the break.

Fight Club," You Do Not Talk About Fight Club
","All the clues are there-- probably every frame analyzed by huge cult followers. Fight Club is a film that is almost begged to be rewatched, yet there's still something that compels me to not give it all the credit it has garnered. There will be plenty of you that are huge fans of this film, and those that haven't seen it may end up really enjoying it. So, I will make sure not to give away the mind-numbing twist, unlike Rosie O'Donnell (she spoiled it on her talk-show).Let's start with the main ingredients (of the cast and crew, not for soap). Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliantly cast for their roles. Norton fits the insomniac 100% even if his narration dulls slightly after two-thirds of the film, and, along with his iconic wardrobe, Brad Pitt has the perfect look of a rabble-rouser type of friend. And when is Helena Bonham Carter not awesome? There are also fun parts for Meat Loaf and an unrecognizable Jared Leto. Needless to say, I have no issue with the acting.As regards to the skewed time line, I have zero complaints about the first 45 minutes or so (Pitt's monologue for the fight club is pretty dang cool) of the film. The setup is all there with some clever dialogue, especially for subsequent viewings, and David Fincher employs a certain craftiness to how he envisions the film to play out. It's not so much that the film had too many issues, but my vision and expectations for what to come were basically on the opposite spectrum of what did happen. What I can say that is that the writing started becoming as crazed as the protagonists portrayed in the plot that followed. To pinpoint a little better what I am trying to get across; basically, I felt the film took a turn for the worst as soon as Project Mayhem was mentioned. I was fine swimming with the sharks in the deep end the movie was already in, but they lost me when the water started to fall off the side of their flat perceived world.It's becoming a much bigger problem than I anticipated to discuss this film (despite explicit directions to not talk about Fight Club) the way I should be able to, but to do so is too compromising to those that haven't watched it, so hopefully I can refrain. As I say that, let's talk about the ending without talking about it: I'm not a fan of it. The anti-establishment campaigns of the cult army club thingamajig went too philosophical in its uprising message. The most basic way to express my opinion on it is to say that it bit off more than it could chew. I believe a smaller payload with a different direction for the fight club could have made the twist more rewarding. In its strange defense, the ending is exactly what was needed to propel Fight Club to the level of cult status (ironic and satirical for an ironic and satirical film, I got that). Achieving this cult following does not cement a film to greatness necessarily, but it causes viewers to at least try understanding better the effects and results from the film. With that perspective, I do understand the brashness of the storytelling that captivated a set of audience. In fact, I would probably admit to recommending this film because of iconic moments and the uniqueness of its entirety; however, I will keep my outsider place of personally believing it is overrated in what it accomplished.

The Hunger Games," A solid book-to-screen adaptation
","Let's start with a positive: This cast is star-studded. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the stars do a good job, but it's a start-- and luckily for us, they do a tremendous job. Jennifer Lawrence enters the celebrity life coming out of her role as Mystique from X-Men, and perhaps for another time to discuss, I hate that character. With that said, she was also coming from an Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone-- a lifeless film that nobody need bother to see unless you're just compelled enough for the one bright spot of the film which is her performance. And Jenny from the block is handed the role of Katniss Everdeen, a persistent heroine sure to have inspired girls everywhere. Needless to say, she had big shoes to fill, for everybody would be judging whether she fit the mold of the character envisioned from the book. And emphatically I will tell you that she succeeds. You root for the gender role breaking Katniss at every step. Perhaps even more impressive than Lawrence are the people she is surrounded by. The unrestrained costume designs for the Capitol work so well with Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Bank's characters. But easily my favorites are the hilarious Woody Harrelson and Wes Bentley's beard.Undoubtedly, you guys know the basis for The Hunger Games. Even so, it is important to at least talk about the structure. There are two distinct halves in the film: the ceremonies before the Games, and the Games themselves. And in the off chance that you have no idea what The Hunger Games is, I shall briefly clarify. A future dystopia consists of 12 districts. In order to keep the threats of revolt at ease, fear is struck by an event known as the Hunger Games that takes place annually. Everybody ages 12-18 have their names put in to be drawn at random with two tributes from the 12 districts, a male and female. And for those of you counting at home, that's 24 tributes every year.Katniss lives in District 12 with her sister and mother. This district is mineral based, and thus, also hard-working and poor. To the credit of the film, lots of this can be inferred through visual context instead of pointless exposition. The film is 140 minutes, and even though I think that could have been reduced through some cuts, it reminds me of what happened with Jurassic Park. Just like author Suzanne Collins, Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton also had a hand in writing the screenplay for the film adaptation. And he explained what he did by saying that about 10% of the book made it to big screen, and this is simply because that's all that could be fit into it. Similarly, there's details I wished to have seen made it to the movie, but there's only so much that can be done. With all that they had, there's nothing huge that got excluded to cause any outrage.Something becoming familiar ground is a love triangle in these dystopian teenage novels. And there's certainly glimpses of this in this film, but I'm glad we aren't swarmed by it (can't speak for the sequels). One of my negatives follows from this. I have been a fan of Josh Hutcherson, but to be a little hypocritical, he is not what one imagines as Peeta. The best way to describe his performance is just 'good,' nothing more, and really nothing less. And completing the triangle is Katniss's childhood friend, Gale. And I'm not sure how much there is to think about for Katniss, for when I have the chance to pick either Josh Hutcherson or Liam Hemsworth, you know I'd take Liam any day... What, I'm getting off track? I do apologize.As I said before, there are two halves to this film. And separately, they both work. And they are necessary together, but it is pacing that simply is designed better for a book. The ceremonies are fresh and entertaining, but it's a lot of build up for what will end up turning into another half of the film. And this again plays into my belief that ten minutes or so of run time could have been cut to flow everything better. In regards to the Games themselves, I think what was accomplished is pretty astounding. I was so curious how you transfer weeks of survival in the forest into an hour of action-packed fatal adventure. There's never a dull in the action, yet no scene is forced. And the brilliantly harrowing setup for Collins's plot is transferred to the screen by shaky cams that bring the audience to the arena while giving glimmers of wonderful nature in, ultimately, all that the Capitol and its citizens see, a reality show-like game. Gruesome? Absolutely. Stunning? Well, not on the same level of some beautiful films, but for the sake of compliments, yes, stunning.

500 Days of Summer," 500 (Days of Summer)
","As the narrator tells the audience, this is a story about boy meets girl. But you are mistaken if you think this is a story about love. Now we all know the rom-com formula, so say it with me: Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl breaks up with boy, boy and girl make up. Yay. Happy ending. And you find these aspects in (500) Days of Summer, and it certainly does fall under this category, but if I were ever to suggest a rom-com to one of my fellow brethrens, this would be the one (well, maybe Midnight in Paris, but that's not truly a rom-com either). The point is that if you didn't know better, a quick check on IMDB for a summary of the film would make it sound forgettable, but I am here to tell you that there is a bunch worth watching.Right from the start the film sets the quirkier tone of the humor to play out. And not only is it pretty darn rootin' tootin' funny to me, but the overall clever framework and setups have a broad paint stroke on who it will appeal to. To get the basis down, the film jumps back and forth through the 500 days, and it quickly shows the breakup around day 290. Well, if it just skipped to step #3 of the 4 in rom-coms, why should we bother watching the entire film?Now I could be cheesy and say, 'Oh, but the story of how they fell in love is worth the watch!' Now that wouldn't want you to watch it, me to watch it, or really anybody who has a better way to spend an hour and a half. Luckily, as the narrator suggested, that's not the point of the film. Yes there's solid chemistry between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel (even if she plays the same carefree, do whatever she wants type of girl in every film), but really the money hits the mark in a couple of standout scenes. I'm talking about the dance number and the expectations vs. reality. And you may have no idea what I'm referring to if you haven't watched the film, and that's okay. All I'm trying to say is that there is actually a script here that takes a story told a thousand times and projects it in multiple appealing ways.From beginning till end, you will be watching the film happily instead of either taking a nap and pretending to have cared about the past hour or preparing the tissues and triple chocolate ice cream. It's an enjoyable film with a good soundtrack-- not much more you can ask.

Man of Steel," A Bit Derivative, but Still Fun
","Along with Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe is undeniably awesome to watch as Jor-El, Superman's actual father. The rest of the cast all look very pretty in their scenes, but their purposes are only very slight, and add a little characterization to this other-wordly feeling movie (I'll elaborate more when I get to the director). But in all honesty, the likes of Amy Adams and Laurence Fishburne don't add any big acting chops for this film. Michael Shannon proves a worthy foe as General Zod. And on that note, I must make a slight aside. I was quite impressed to come into this film and not hear any mention of kryptonite or Lex Luthor (yes, there's an Easter egg, but hush up). One of my biggest flaws with Superman is that literally his only weakness is kryptonite; thus, the story lines get dragged on too much. General Zod is a great change of pace, even if he is similar to Iron Man or Hulk villains in the sense that the villain features very similar powers to the superhero (one huge upside to the Batman universe).Then we have the man of the hour. Probably the biggest praise I can give this film is Henry Cavill. To me he represents the perfect Superman: the hair, facial structure, body physique (ladies, be ready for an absolute beast of a body), deep voice, and ever so slight mannerisms mainly seen in a comforting grin. He truly is the Man of Steel.If I'm being honest here, I have to give it up to Zack Snyder. He takes this CGI-filled movie, and he allows his decisions to dictate what you see. The opening sequence on Krypton is a little much for me, granted, but there's a lot of really power-packed shots like the sun glowing between the fingers of Superman. Furthermore, such sequences such as Superman testing his limits on flight show just how great a reboot is supposed to look.Zack Snyder isn't perfect though. There were one too many shots of a broad landscape only to zoom in on a speeding, flying object. His message of stepping back and looking at this from a perspective of a human suddenly finding signs of aliens works well, but it was used just too much. The action sequences look great, but I do wonder if Batman vs Superman will address the amount of damage caused to Metropolis. Like, that economy is down the hole. And take it whatever way you want, but the final fight reminded me so much of The Matrix Revolutions.The final issue I take with the film is in its essence. At the core I feel like Superman doesn't fit into a darker world that Batman embodies and embraces. I understand the reboot and the direction the producers wanted to take it, but there's a part of me missing John William's 'Superman Theme.' Sorry, Hans Zimmer, there's just a few composers even you can't beat. There's plenty of merits on the film from the director, main actor, and top-notch special effects, but the separation of this reboot from previous Superman movies mirrors Batman's reboot to a fault.

Captain America: Civil War," Captain Avengers
","Which side do you take in this star-studded cast? Before I answer that question, let's establish the ground rules. The political intrigue is very similar to Batman vs. Superman, and you can't really fault Civil War for coming out just a couple months later. Basically, after the opening action scene causes much destruction, the government wants to take over the wheel and pin some accountability and control over these meta humans. After montages of previous Avengers moments and some sob stories for personal reference, Tony Stark thinks for somebody besides himself and signs with the government. This is supposed to put a band-aid over the rift and still allow for safety; Steve Rogers disagrees. If they have to obey a superior officer to give the green light, it may be too late, he argues. And both have valid points and the rest of the superheroes take their sides.That's the gist of it. And I mentioned the opening action sequence. Well, I kinda lied because first a flashback to how Bucky became the Winter Soldier was needed to create another divide in the heroes. I'm not sure if a simple flip-flop would work, you would probably need an additional scene before the transition, but to have a flashback and then an opening action scene is like you wanted to open the movie with one of them but needed both scenes and decided to simply put them back-to-back.Now, the biggest flaw of the film is staring down all of us. Captain America: Civil War... Wait, so what point am I making? There's a dozen heroes or so in this film, but the title is still technically a Captain America movie. What this does is try balancing two aspects: a personal focus on Captain America, but also providing a broad stroke with all the Avengers. The result is slightly muddied and not as crisp as it should be. And the reason I may be being a little tough could be contributed to The Dark Knight Rises. I love that film; one aspect it couldn't control (although I thought Nolan handled it so well) was the fact that it had to follow The Dark Knight. Similarly, the previous installment The Winter Soldier is easily in my top 5 superhero films, possibly and probably top 3. It's smart, crisp, and full of terrific action. And Civil War hits most of the marks-- just not as many as the previous film and that's okay and understandable.What the Captain America movies have always succeeded at the most in the hand-to-hand combat. This movie continues with those great fighting scenes. Before we get to the obvious showdown, I do still have stuff to complain about. With the Winter Soldier acting as a fugitive for large portions of the film, there's a couple chase scenes. And the movement of jumping from a building into a cartwheel to avoid impact doesn't look smooth; this continues when Black Panther is introduced and there's a big chase with cars in a tunnel. The movement isn't fluid-- this hearkens back to the sub-par CGI from the first Captain America movie.Okay, okay, my heart isn't completely spattered with black ink spots. The showdown excels on every mark. This isn't nearly as dark and fatal as Batman v Superman, so the dialogue that ensues is full of pep and hilarity-- and yes, Spider-Man is one of the funniest along with Ant-Man. Of the newest additions to make their appearance, my favorite goes to Black Panther. His motivation is pretty typical, but I think he was handled really well and with an overall air of coolness and royalty. Additionally, Captain America's suit looks really good, and the way all the different superpowers clash is a blast to watch.Behind the back-and-forth between our heroes, there's a story that keeps itself going, but again not to the same power and tenacity as Winter Soldier. And after the initial action, there was too much exposition afterward that lulled on. As I described the more light-hearted aspect of the fighting, I said that it helped that there wasn't really a fatality aspect involved. And this is absolutely true, but it also affects the climax briefly seen from the trailer. The grittiness of Dawn of Justice had more tension in wondering how far these characters might go, but with this film no matter how bloody a face might get, there wasn't really a concern that a major death would take place.All in all, there's a couple scenes in the film that make the entire film more than worthy to watch. And it's a solid piece in its entirety, but there's still cracks in its framework that prevents it from being one of the best. It's been awhile since I've seen Age of Ultron, but if I were to compare it to that, I'd easily recommend this film more. It doesn't surpass Winter Soldier, but there's enough to hold its own-- and setup future installments for that matter.

Quantum of Solace," The Worst Daniel Craig Bond Film
","To understand this film, think of it as a trigger-happy Bourne film. And I mean that in one of the worst ways possible. The editing is atrocious. The film takes a Matrix Reloaded approach and stacks action on action; however, it's not even as successful as that film. The opening action sequence has one decent moment, but anyone able to follow the rapid edits deserves an award. What such rapid editing tends to correlate with is weak content to begin with. Some well thought out long shots could've worked effectively, but the truth is that there just isn't anything special about the action set-pieces besides perhaps locale. And don't even mention the parachute opening 10 feet above the ground. You can't walk away from that without an injury.Although I can appreciate some of what Jack White accomplished with 'Another Way to Die,' Alicia Keys only takes away from the song-- making it and the corresponding animation the worst theme as well. The Bond Girls are the worst as well. Let's see, what other worsts does it have... Oh yeah! The villain is so uninteresting. And it's so obvious during the climax that there's no way he could even put up a fight against Bond.Despite going for the darker, remorseless tone, I actually felt that Daniel Craig brought some of his greatest charm in this film. Even though there really isn't any cool dialogue to accompany him, I feel that after already having one round as the famous Brit, Craig was tailored in his approach to the character, and it's one of the aspects that pays off for the film.But enough praise. The film has annoying characters, and even when trying to fit elements from the previous film, the plot is so basic and not memorable in any way. But when you have an action flick, almost all can be forgiven with quality action. And the film just falls flat. Not only is this the worst Craig Bond film, it just isn't a quality picture. It's a misstep, and that probably contributed to the gap between this film and the next one.

Batman Begins," The Great Beginning to a Darker Bat
","Batman is back in black! Last seen about 8 years ago in the disastrous Batman & Robin, Christopher Nolan took it under his wing to reboot the franchise in a darker, fresher manner-- he showed the crew Blade Runner before shooting to give an idea of what he wanted to do. Now it's the norm for superhero movies to be darker and more realistic (and James Bond films for that matter), but Batman Begins is where it starts.It's not until after an hour into the film where we truly see Batman in all his glorious armor. What was going on beforehand? An amazingly told origin story in typical non-linear fashion from (my favorite director) Nolan. The film starts with hundreds of flashing bats, and from there we are transported into a world with a Gotham we haven't seen before. Wayne Towers is at the center of this crumbling city as the Waynes do their best to help however they can with such acts as building a cheap train that loops around the city. We also travel to the beautifully cold Tibet where Bruce Wayne trains in ninja-fashion to not just overcome his childhood fear of bats, but to embrace it under the guidance of the superb Liam Neeson, a mercenary following orders from Ken Watanabe's Ra's al Ghul.Christopher Nolan hails from Her Majesty's nation, and he brings plenty of actors with him. Christian Bale utilizes the new tone with a unique Batman voice that may put some fans at unease, but a voice that I believe perfectly captures the idea behind the franchise. And on that note of an idea, what marvels (sorry, wrong comics) me is how Batman is approached. He is so much more than a vigilante in a mask-- he is a symbol of hope for the citizens, and of fear for the criminals. This carries through the fear-driven film and throughout the trilogy to unseen levels of depth in a superhero story. But back to the characters, Michael Caine is the most charming Alfred imaginable (but I do look forward to Jeremy Irons), and Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman provide trustworthy allies in Lucius Fox and Jim Gordon, respectively, that drives the franchise past the shortcomings of even Tim Burton's Batman with his fat, pointless Gordon. I will admit, Rachel becomes much better after Katie Holmes departs after this film. And I must include mention of Cillian Murphy, playing as Jonathan Crane aka Scarecrow, who brings such energy and crazy charm with his hypnotizing blue eyes (seriously, Nolan made him take off his glasses whenever he could just to show off his eyes).The scenes are well-developed, especially Batman's drug bust and capture of Falcone. With the fight scenes, the super-fast editing shows the quickness and stealth and blink-and-you'll-miss-it aspect of Batman, but it also makes it quite difficult to understand what's going on. While I understand what you were going for, Mr. Nolan, I do appreciate that you dropped this technique for the sequels.Outside of the fight scenes, what you can depend on Nolan for the most is the excellent dialogue. I have complimented previous films for the subtlety and what is said without saying anything, but with Nolan helping out with the script as he normally does; we are treated to lines that are never wasted and complimented by awesome one-liners (utilized better in the sequels too).I think there has been some lost appreciation due to films later like Iron Man, and of course The Dark Knight. The failing, light-hearted, toy-heavy franchise truly came to life in this reboot. It is not the best from Nolan, Hans Zimmer, and regular actor Michael Caine, but it set the bar and the tone to scramble the gears of how these films were perceived; and thus setting up not only one of the best superhero movies, but one of the best ever in The Dark Knight. But do not overlook the clever first entry in The Dark Knight trilogy.",8,1,2,12 June 2018
Twilight," Sparkling Vampires
","Twilight is garbage. I'm not sure if there's been a film that I have cared less about. Like, I'm not even sure how to do a review; I guess I will list some of the blatant negatives, and maybe near the end I can scavenge for some redeemable quality.I was so bored. I couldn't make it in one sitting; I had to take 2 breaks so that I didn't fall asleep. Now that I am typing that, I am regretting I didn't just sleep through it. I mean, I understand movies galore have an expositional setup for the first 15 minutes before getting into the meat of the film. Considering these vampires that drink the blood of animals are vegetarians, there's no meat on the bones of the film. To get a little more specific, as soon as Bella enters school halfway through the semester, everybody flocks to her and seems to know her already. Why?? I don't know! And to think that Edward would be compelled to Bella over Anna Kendrick may be the most glaring fault of all. Plus, the dialogue that goes on - and the directing with it-- is the least realistic thing I have ever seen. Nobody acts like they do. And I'm definitely looking at you Kristen Stewart, you sighing, breathing, half-laughing introvert you. For a girl that enjoys being alone, you spend the entire film with other people.I was able to release a couple of chuckles at the movement of the vampires. Oh man, it was so cheesy...And they shine bright like a diamond.Seriously, what was this movie even about? I was about to dedicate this paragraph to the plot, but I have nothing to tell. If I wasn't zoning out at points in the film, I wish I was.There's no motivation for the film, and it uses about 1 hour and 30 minutes to build a bond between the leads, establish friendships and villains, and put hints at conflicts to come; but really, it was just pointless because I didn't believe any of it. But Bella did. Oh, Edward, you've been watching me in my sleep for the past couple of months? That's cool. Before Bella figures out what Edward and his family really are, she pointlessly asks so many questions. It turns out she's right to have been questioning of everything, but she would've been an obsessed crazy person in any other normal situation - correction, in any other situation. Also, the first 45 minutes of gazing into Edward's eyes at school? I'm not sure if it was supposed to be mysterious or intimate, but it was just weird and uncomfortable.I'd like to end on some sort of a high note. You somewhat find it in Bella's dad. I honestly believe he was the only rational character in the whole film. So kudos to you, Pops.

Avengers: Infinity War," Overhyped
","I swear I'm not a cynic that wants to watch the world burn. I liked the movie; in fact, I might see it again, but is it deserving of the box-office Hulk smashing and saying it is the best Marvel film over the past decade? Well, I don't think so. I've contemplated doing a ranking of the Marvel films, but we can save that for later. Also, with so much going on and so much safeguarding that has happened, I'll do my initial review and then clearly mark a spoiler section afterward where we really discuss the juicy stuff if you're one of the 12 people left that hasn't seen this film. I saw it a week ago, and I still felt like I was late to it. So many characters. It hurts trying to think of everybody that appeared in this film. Some shined more than others. The directors did a wonderful job of making sure the tone of each franchise was appropriate. The improv heavy Thor: Ragnarok shown through with Thor and Hulk, the galaxy guards felt right, and Black Panther and Wakanda all made sense. So they got the vibe down. But not all individual characters were consistent. Let's try to go down the list:Iron Man: Tony is mostly a success in this filmThor: I'd argue that Thor is the star and is given some of the greatest moments. I do have to say, however, that there is a fight scene where Thor flies up and the half second shot of him was the most egregious CGI in awhile.Captain America: He does his part. Nothing else to note reallyBruce Banner: Really tried putting on the cheese, and I think of all the humor, his missed the most.Doctor Strange: Plays a nice role, but Tony Stark honestly does overshadow him.Spider-Man: More hit or miss than in Civil War, but I'm still a Spidey fan.Black Widow: Would be totally forgettable except that it's impossible to forget Scarlett Johansson. God bless.The Guardians: We'll discuss controversy with Star-Lord later, and despite some good moments, he also had his own missteps. Drax was the best part about Vol. 2, and he was the funniest thing about this movie as well-love the big dude, especially when he plays comedically off of Mantis (one of Drax's funniest lines about Gamora was also improvised, just fyi). Groot and Rocket Rabbit Raccoon are great. I like Gamora, but I was hoping for more depth.Vision: I'm a Paul Bettany fan, and he dominated the previous Avengers film, but he was trash in this film.Scarlet Witch: She brings good contrast to Vision.Black Panther: Not given enough screen time, but he's a bright side. There are others like Nebula and Falcon, but I just can't do anymore. Oh, but one more character of note is Peter Dinklage. That guy is great. Okay, enough about the heroes. I'm looking forward to seeing Cable in Deadpool 2, but Josh Brolin is fantastic as Thanos in this film. I do get a bit tired of his motion-capture face with all the other CGI that goes on during the impressive film, but he represents a real threat-and as a fully realized character. It's truly a joy to watch, and you never know what to expect when he appears in a scene. Look, here's what I'm most upset about the film. It didn't quite bring the magic I wanted (not talking about Strange either). When The Avengers came out and we watched that cast save New York, that was a blast. There are glimpses during some of the fights of enjoying what can happen when all these heroes come and fight together, but it never fully engaged me. And the way the story plays out, there was never really a chance for it. I could tell there were some strange transitions due to trying to cut the film down, but I was mostly impressed by the editing. It's a gargantuan film and not an easy task. Like refrain from the large soda because it is a long movie, but it works out decently well. I will discuss more in detail the spoiler section below, but I had problems with the opening, and the ending did not affect me all that much. It's a long, CGI filled movie with so many stars that mostly are balanced out. It's entertaining, and it really is fun to watch in theaters. But is it still overhyped? Yeah. Yeah, it kinda is.--SPOILERS- I hate what happened in the opening scene. The idea behind it is obviously that hey, Thanos easily attacks the remains of the Asgardians, and it is supposed to set the tone for the rest of the film. RIP to Idris Elba, a great part about the Thor trilogy, but I'm not 100% yet that Loki is dead. He's died before, and even Thor contemplates about it. But anyways, 2 big players die in the opening. That's supposed to set the tone for the rest of the movie and wants to say to the audience, hey, this is the kind of Avengers film this is going to be. Get ready to say bye-bye to many of your heroes... But then, that didn't really happen. Gamora had her green blood spilt, and Vision was destroyed, but that was really it. One of those was a latter half death and the other was in the climax. They almost killed Tony, but they chickened out of that death and made Doctor Strange give in (a nice emotional moment, but no deaths). If they don't clean up their act and actually kill big people off next year, I will be upset. People are speculating all over the ending, but I'm honestly just a bit meh over it. Firstly, after thinking it over, I don't blame Star-Lord for going berserk on Titan and ruining the plan. Like the love of his life was murdered, so I don't blame his reaction. Side note-the biggest glimmer I talked about earlier with the fight scenes was the fight with Thanos on Titan. Like Spidey jumping through Strange's portals and delivering blows with one-liners is fun. And earlier seeing him use Stark gadgets to aid him in the fight is cool too. But alas. The biggest reason I'm not concerned over what the ending really means or what will happen is that Black Panther is one of the ones that dissolved. We all know for a fact that Black Panther isn't actually dead, and that alone is enough to convince me not to worry about half the population being disintegrated. And since I wasn't all that worried, it didn't really hit the emotional level it wanted me too; however, of all the characters, Tom Holland's disappearance was really well done. Also, when Doctor Strange was looking at all those futures, he mentions that of the millions of possibilities, they only won once. And right before he disappears, he tells Tony that this was the only way. So again, I have no idea how the Avengers manages to fix this, but I know it will happen somehow, and as the end credits tell, we're not done with Thanos yet-even if he is currently watching his sunset on his summer break. Predictions for Avengers 4: I honestly have done very little thinking on this, but here goes. Unlike popular belief, Captain America won't die; he will probably hang up his shield though. Since they scared us once in this film, Iron Man won't die either. Maybe someone like Bucky, er Winter Soldier, er White Wolf will sacrifice himself. Uh, Black Widow still hasn't gotten a solo film, and I think the origin films are getting a little old, so maybe she won't die. I think Marky Mark Ruffalo will get some moments as the big green guy, but he ultimately dies. I'm not sure how stuff gets reversed, but it could have something to do with the Time Stone. What I'm really trying to say is that I have no idea what will happen. I'm not losing any sleep over it, but I will be sure to check it out next year.

Across the Universe," Just a Failure as a Musical
","Jude and Prudence show up to town to allow some more songs from the Beatles to be played. Yes sir, Across the Universe is a musical throwing it back to the 60s for a love story of sorts torn away with war and strife and LSD. If this isn't making too much sense, you're not alone. Despite a couple 5 minute naps, I will attempt to review the film as a whole.I think the movie took the easy route right from the start, and it never recovered from the decision. What I'm talking about is story structure. Obviously, all the songs are already there. So how did they make the movie? They took the songs, and they attempted to branch a story out of them to fill in the gaps. The result is high-quality music videos with small periods of 'story' in between.'Well, Mr. Smarty Pants, do you have any better ideas?' I do, but it's harder to pull off which is why I said they went easy. There are two types of musicals: Those that have the songs in mind and try creating a story around them (like Across the Universe), and those that have a story already in place that will be propelled forward by the songs. Personally, I feel the latter is almost always the better formula to work with, but even then it's not a perfect system. I'm just saying that it could have been a huge turn-around for this film. I mean, there might be a decent story in there somewhere, but I didn't really find it nor have the patience to put effort into searching for it.As this is a musical, we should definitely talk about the songs. Give credit to the film for trying to give modern updates to the songs with flashy graphics to help, but the characters don't add anything because nobody cares about them through the story. I will say, however, one of my biggest issues is that I think most of the songs are worse versions than the originals. Maybe that's a personal bias, who knows. My prime example is 'I Want to Hold Your Hand;' the film version slows it down. That ruins the entire beat, and the lyrics aren't powerful enough to carry the weight of a slower song. The vocals of the majority of characters is great, but not everyone hits the right notes, and vocals alone aren't worth an update of these songs.Despite my inner Scrooge to humbug at these modern folks and their attempts to reminisce on previous times, I still found myself singing along with such classics as 'Come Together,' 'Revolution,' and 'Hey Jude.' I wouldn't even call myself the biggest Beatles fan, but those that claim to hate the band probably just haven't heard the right songs.This 2 hour + movie is not worth it for the few notable songs featured. The story drags on, and it ends up giving you the feeling of 'Oh, is this the last song? Nope, here's another scene.' And thus it goes on and on. Maybe I should just let it be. I don't know.Not sure where it would have fit in, but not seeing 'Yesterday' featured was a big bummer. There are a couple other songs I would have preferred, but I honestly am not sure if this was album-based or what and I don't care enough to research it.Just did a little research, and I'm still unsure of how each song was chosen to appear in the film. Oh well.",4,0,2,12 June 2018
The Hurt Locker," About as good as they come
","As with most really good war films, the movie is full of zooming shots and hand-held cameras. And you get the occasional soldiers acting as fools in the barracks to show character growth; however, that's basically all the similarities there are to other war films. Which is a positive to the first female best director and picture winner Kathryn Bigelow (beating out ex-husband James Cameron). The movie doesn't have a great flow to it, for it's not meant to be expressed as a story progressing; rather, setting the tone from the first scene, the audience is left guessing as to what will occur next with every encounter with explosives. Even if you are able to predict the outcome to some of these situations, the film still jars you with the suddenness and briefness of life. Now, it is not my favorite war film, but the execution is still a huge accomplishment to behold.Since the film showcases life on the bomb squad, there has to be a dynamic relationship among the characters. It's honestly pretty typical after Guy Pearce's short run as leader: cocky leader who's great at what he does with little regard to danger (Oscar-nominated Jeremy Renner-- not the best performance, but a career-making performance), Mr. Ol' Reliable who follows the books better (Anthony Mackie-- personally enjoyed his performance the most), and The Kid (Brian Geraghty-- he got this role because of Jarhead). What I do appreciate the most, however, is that the characters are portrayed not by the typical banter thrown back and forth, but how they interact and have each other's back every single day in the field. And it's worth mentioning that Lord Vold-- excuse me, He-Who-Must-Not-- er, Ralph Fiennes, has a great cameo thrown in the midst.In case anybody was counting, the movie won 6 Oscars and was nominated for 3 more. Did it deserve all that acclaim? No, of course not, but that's just how the Academy works. Nominated for best score, but I hardly noticed any music throughout (which is actually for the better), and nominated for all those technical Oscars. What it rightfully won was sound mixing/editing; for the record, those are two different awards, but it doesn't make too much of a difference to a simple-minded man such as myself. There's a great sniper fight about halfway through with whizzing bullets, and all the explosions throughout will release chest-hair manliness in anybody. What takes the cake is the opening sequence. It is hard to find a cooler shot than the gravel-and-Hell-raising, slow motion fatal explosion that makes the audience pay attention right away.The Hurt Locker's greatest strength comes from the guidance of Kathryn Bigelow, who would amaze audiences again with Zero Dark Thirty. Yes, the movie is a war film, but there is little ground to compare it to. You may not come out of the film happy, but you will not be dulled, and you will have a new found appreciation for daily tasks of those who risk it all to protect us.

Ex Machina," Proof that you can make a quality film on a limited budget
","This film was the directorial debut for Alex Garland who garnered attention for writing 28 Days Later and Sunshine (and even Dredd). The movie really didn't get much love at the box office (unlike that fast-movie car franchise), but it rightfully received some Golden Globe nominations for the acting. Even more impressively, it beat out films like Star Wars, The Revenant, and Mad Max for the Oscar for best visual effects. When you look at the aforementioned movies and see their 100 + million dollar budgets, it only makes it all the more impressive that Ex Machina won on a budget of 15 mil. All this talk about the awards and talented film crew is fine, but what really matters is what happens when you sit down (you can stand or squat if you want, I'll only slightly judge you) and actually watch the film. This film is 1 hour 57 minutes long. Why should you care? Well, if writer/director Garland wanted to provide crummy backstory and exposition at the beginning, he very well could have. Lucky for us, this man understands story structure and character arcs, and this understanding is why this movie is under 2 hours. So what is the story? Gleeson plays Caleb, a young programmer chosen to visit the remote house of the company's CEO Nathan (this takes up probably the first 2 minutes-keeps the pace going, the mystery of the story intact, and the ability to fully develop the characters through their actions in the film itself). Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac who was with Gleeson in Star Wars playing Poe (and he's been in numerous other hits), introduces Caleb to Ava. Ava is a female AI, and Nathan wants to see if she could pass the Turing test, using Caleb as the human element. Very briefly, this test basically has a human interacting with a cyborg/AI/robot. If the human can't tell that the person they're talking to isn't actually human, then the AI passed the test. The film essentially consists of 2 elements: Caleb and Nathan's interactions, and Caleb and Ava's interactions. Nathan is a peculiar, eccentric genius with a love of women and alcohol, and Caleb is much more innocent and reserved. The scenes with Caleb and Nathan function in many ways; for example, the slightest of foreshadowing is given through their allusions to classic mythology, literature, and philosophy. Also, the talks switch between being inside and out. And both the technologically enhanced house (unlike some sci-fi films, all the futuristic stuff is logically placed and actually is put to practical use) and the isolated surroundings are beautiful in stark, contrasting ways. The house has the slick, clean white look with vibrant, almost neon red and blue lights used throughout; and the world outside takes us away from any claustrophobia and allows the audience to relax in the lush greens, the flowing streams, and the warming sunlight. And in case you started getting lost in all of my explanations, above all, Caleb and Nathan's conversations are fun, well-written, and smart. When the 2 boys of the house are done talking, it's time to get down to business. Alicia Vikander plays Ava, and her performance is breath-taking. As much as I enjoy Scarlett Johansson, as far as anything related to cyborgs are concerned, Vikander's performance takes the artificial cake. Caleb and Ava's sessions start off basic, but as the questions become more relevant, layers upon layers are pulled back-both on an intellectual level and an emotional one. Does Ava's responses constitute as her consciousness replying? Sorry, ya spoilbrats, you'll have to watch the film for that answer. And it's an answer well worth watching for. The visuals are outstanding, the acting is superb, and the story structure is brilliant. It all adds up to one of the smarter and better films you watch with an ending that will probably surprise you (for better or worse). Heck, nerdy little me even applauds this movie's sound mixing. Seriously, pay attention any time Ava moves her body-- that noise alone is synthetic supremeness. We've seen the dumbed down side of robotics in I, Robot, and we've seen cyborgs integrated well in the Alien franchise. What we get in Ex Machina is the cyborg we didn't know we needed. It's simply an engaging and interesting movie in general, and for one that flew past the radar of nearly everyone in its theatrical release, it's high quality stuff. Check it out. And then check out the other films I mentioned in this review. I named a whole bunch of great films. Except that stupid franchise that has Vin Diesel saying 'I don't have friends... I've got... family.' Take my advice, Vin. Stick to lines like 'Superman' and 'I am Groot.'

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," One of the best Star Wars yet! First half of review is spoiler free, then the spoilers are clearly marked
","I'm surprised to hear about all the criticism this film is taking. It only seems fair then to start this review off by looking at what the general criticisms have been and my take on them, and then we'll move on to the rest of the review. And for anyone who hasn't seen the film, most of what I'll talk about can be gathered from the trailers, and I'll save any spoilers for the end and mark them off clearly, so you can read on without a nervous eye. With that said, although the trailers don't ruin the film, I was glad I avoided them before watching the film (and the first thing I did after watching was go back and watch the trailers to see if I did in fact make the right decision).Fan Criticisms:路 Rian Johnson ruined the character of Luke Skywalker!!!What's been getting publicized is Mark Hamill's comments about his character, the director's vision, and the film itself. And it's interesting because his comments actually kind of relate to how I felt while watching the movie. Hamill reportedly told Johnson (the writer and director) that he fundamentally disagreed with him on his character, but he would go along with his vision to the best of his abilities because that's his job. Under speculation is how a jedi master from The Return of the Jedi became a cynical hermit that was on the breach of murder. Now then, everything from that previous statement is blown out of proportion and not well thought out. After 2 years of waiting what Luke will do when Rey extends her arm out to offer his lightsaber, his reply I find to be both awesome for the film, and a great way to almost undermine J. J. Abrams. Before anyone gets too upset, I'll be coming back to the transition of Jonhson from Abrams' The Force Awakens. But after this quick exchange, Luke exclaims that the jedi must end. If you leave it at that, well, that does sound kinda cynical and cranky; and at that point, all we still know is that Ben Solo turned evil sometime while training under Luke. I feel like fans became toddlers once their beacon of light hero suddenly has a conflicting outlook, and the toddlers tuned out the rest of the movie afterward. If you actually watch the film, I think the character motivations are explained and work well, and it presents interesting themes that result in new territory for this historic saga.Mark Hamill later regretted his public disagreements because his goal was to make a great movie, and he believes Johnson achieved that and more. And I think he might have said that he was wrong. I was hesitant at the beginning of the movie, but this new Luke Skywalker is a deep, unique character that is played wonderfully by Hamill's talents. We could have taken The Force Awakens approach and just ripped off like Ben Kenobi from A New Hope and have Luke be that, but this film shows that even he in his wiser years still has stuff to learn. I mean, Luke is the best part about this film. He's awesome, Hamill's awesome, and I'm about to start fanboying so let's move on.路 We still didn't get the background stories we wanted from the big characters.Most of the question marks apply to Supreme Leader Snoke. Who the old bloke is, where he was during the first 6 movies, the scar on his forehead, how he turned and trained Solo into Kylo Ren, yada yada. Everyone knows The Force Awakens is a copy of A New Hope, so it seemed reasonable enough to receive an Empire Strikes Back treatment from The Last Jedi. To me what we receive instead is a combination of elements from episodes 5 and 6, and even parts from the prequels, and it's blended together and poured over a new dish entirely. This film does a great job of limiting the times it hearkens back to the previous films, and it builds on what exists so nicely. Snoke was such a boring character in 7, and with the help of the magical Andy Serkis, I think the character is worked into the story in a surprising way. It won't answer fans' questions about him, but who cares because I think it worked well from a narrative standpoint.Other questions are how Maz got Luke's lightsaber in the first place and who Rey's parents are. For the former Maz only has a limited role in this film, and I find that to be the better. She doesn't fit into the story all that much, so I'm fine with it. Plus, there's like a visual novelization that explains how she got the lightsaber. Remember, The Last Jedi is 2 and a half hours long. I'm fine if we don't get scenes of pure exposition regarding the new characters brought in from 7. Staying true to my word, all I'll say is I'm happy with Rey's background. I don't want to say I knew it, but I think my primary guess is what she ends up figuring out, and it again unveils strong themes for the characters to work with.路 Not enough Captain Phasma again!Phasma has little more to do than have a short but relatively cool fight with Finn. It gives both of them something cool to do, but that's basically it. I do understand how after the promise to give her a larger role went sorta unfulfilled, but I'm under more of the impression of eh, who cares. My issue with Phasma is how she managed to escape a planet that was about to explode when she was thrown into a trash compactor. She had a cool costume, but what else in the film would you want from her?路 The humor just didn't feel right.I wasn't bawling out from cracking up during this film, but there were some good jokes. Maybe it was a different kind of humor, almost to a lesser degree the kind found in the later Harry Potter films, but I wouldn't call it an issue. Not all jokes hit their mark, and I can agree that some were placed in a couple strange moments, but I feel the ones that did work stand out more than the ones that didn't.And now that we've addressed most of what is already being talked about, time for more of my own take. I wrote my final persuasive essay for my ENGL 336 class on some themes and and issues I had with The Force Awakens, and I received an A on the paper. Just like his Star Trek films, The Force Awakens looks nice from the onset, but it doesn't hold up under scrutiny. And Abrams loves those light flares on the camera too much. That boy really does love his flares... Anyways, there are 2 points to this. One that people will probably like, and one that they won't. I felt that Rian Johnson took all the right measures in disregarding some of the ideas Abrams presented in the new trilogy. From the opening with Luke to the character arcs to the story progression in general, it's a much different take. Johnson took the existing world and expanded both in scope and in technology in a great way in my view. And the second point is that since The Last Jedi is the first sequel to take place immediately after the events of its predecessor, I still would recommend watching The Force Awakens before seeing The Last Jedi in theaters (where it's meant to be watched).With the possible exception of Finn, I enjoy the direction all the characters took. I can't praise Luke enough because he's awesome in this film, and Kylo Ren exemplifies the ways Johnson takes this universe to surprising grounds, and I think it works. For as long as the film is, we don't get that many scenes of Rey training and honing her abilities. It's one of my criticisms, but she's still an enjoyable character besides that. I think they went too much of a 'princess power' image for Leia (I'm talking about the scene near the beginning that just looks weird), but it's still nice to see Carrie Fisher's final role. And to my knowledge she is getting the Heath Ledger treatment for episode 9; her family gave the studio the rights to use her likeness, but I think they'll just avoid it altogether.As for the new characters, they come with some of the highs and lows. I enjoyed the porgs, and those that didn't are just part of the toddler group of fans. I loved Benicio del Toro, and he's a godsend for this franchise. But my least favorite part of the entire film is Rose. She's annoying, boring, and I was hoping for her death in the climax.Unlike Maz's cantina hideout temple whatever, the casino in this film is awesome. It highlights the great ways the universe expanded, John Williams has fun with it, and I believe Mark Hamill even does some CGI work for one of the creatures in it. I was hoping for some pod-racing, and even if those fathier horse creature things look pretty fake, they're still fun. And the casino works well for both the cinematography that is some of the best, and the costumes that are also some of the best. Like what stuck out in my mind were the updated palace guards that surround Snoke. Those guys are cool. And I haven't talked about Luke enough, so I need to mention that his costumes are awesome as well. The subtle switches made to Rey work well too.Much of the tension of the film is supposed to be created by the necessity of Poe, Finn, and Rose to work out their own plan without Laura Dern and her purple hair finding out, and they must accomplish it under I believe 16 hours. I actually liked Laura's character, but she did make things unnecessarily difficult. And people give Finn and Rose's mission flak, but I think it serves well in both expansion and in tying in with the central themes. I must say, however, that I find the 16 hours pretty arbitrary with how long I feel the mission would actually take. I guess a time under a day creates more tension, but with many of the personal complaints I have, it's whatever and not all that big a deal.
I had some small editing qualms with the opening sequence, and the film also suffered slightly with tonal issues in the first third of the film, but all things considered, I personally only have small gripes with the film. It's 150 minutes long, and it will have you engaged the entire time. The climax is just awesome...

Love & Mercy," Good Beach Boys Because of Paul Dano
","It's time to kick off the summer of reviews! And what better way to do so than with Beach Boys? And so we begin with Love & Mercy, with Paul Dano and John Cusack portraying Brian Wilson in his younger and middle years respectively. I have been a fan of Dano ever since I saw his haunting acting in Prisoners, and he has worked his way up in movies such as 12 Years a Slave. And boy does he shine through here. Not only does he look and act the part, he also sounds the part. And when doing a musical biopic, sounding the part is pretty important and impressive.Now I am a casual Beach Boys fan and really didn't look into their career before this film, but there is really a story to behold. The Dano years of the 60s experiments with LSD and all the typical band stuff from that decade, and it shows the complex mindset of the spontaneous and wonderful mind of Brian Wilson. And you get plenty of good vibrations because you get to listen to a lot of great songs.Go forward a couple of decades to the slightly eccentric Cusack who buys a car from the beautiful Elizabeth Banks who switches up from her usual comedic roles to be a more serious, 'good' character without too much depth (she's not the focus, but is a driving force and provides romantic connections). Gradually, as she dates the divorced Wilson, she discovers the manipulative therapist Paul Giamatti who has kept Wilson away from all of his family for a solid 2 years at least.These scenes switch back and forth, and it is a solid dynamic to keep the interest fresh for what might be off-putting to some when they hear 'biopic.' You will be engaged and committed, especially if you're like me and are unfamiliar with Wilson's life, but you will also see some missed potential. At just over 2 hours, not all scenes hit the mark and tiptoe through the area marked fluff. There isn't always the intensity wanted in the Cusack scenes, so the powerful moments are toned down just a bit. But, then again, hearing Paul Giamatti yell 'SLUT!' over and over can't be all bad.Generally speaking, the Dano scenes are better and what I continued to look forward to in the movie. He does the best acting, and watching his methods to find the perfect melodies while his domestic life has its struggles is engrossing and worth the watch. And again, listening to the formulation of the songs is a big treat.There isn't much to boast about directing, but the incredible performance by Dano and the more suppressed and gloomy Cusack are attention-grabbing enough if for some reason Beach Boys wasn't. Ultimately, you'll come away with new appreciation and curiosity about the band that was briefly even more popular than The Beatles, and that is always a success in the mind of a filmmaker.",7,1,2,12 June 2018
The Shape of Water," Good arthouse fun, but not all that great of a film
","This is very much an arthouse film. For you young guns out there, all I mean by that is that this movie will be appreciated more by cinephiles. It has enough plot structure to be enjoyed above the surface, but it's really looking for the focused to dive into the deep end to find the subtleties and metaphors about. I don't find this to be a masterpiece of storytelling, but let's simply look at its elements by themselves. The story builds up Sally Hawkins' deaf character's mundane routine as a janitor at a research facility for about the first 20 minutes. Although del Toro's directing is at its most prominent, it also could've been shortened down a bit-especially when you consider the story that still has to be told. Also, to backtrack a bit, the very opening sequence is absolutely phenomenal-but anyways. Soon, a mysterious creature led by the always-evil Michael Shannon is transported to the facility for some testing. While everyone views it as a monster that has to be taken care of in some way or another, Hawkins starts to see the other side to the amphibious creature. I don't think they ever specify what it is, but for all intents and purposes, let's call it a merman. To avoid spoilers the plot follows this thread for a little over halfway, then it switches over to a different type of plot to finish the film out. Basically, it switches the main objectives of what needs to be done, and with the time it takes to properly develop each of these story elements, some of the added stuff I feel should've been cut down more: namely, the opening montage and actually getting to the reveal of the creature, and eating some lovely nasty pie at the shop (but I'm sure Richard Jenkins needed the boosted screen time to put him contention for a best supporting actor nod). Speaking of Jenkins, the characters are mostly good. Jenkins fills his role admirably, Hawkins is obviously amazing, Shannon is just playing the role he always plays, and Octavia Spencer turns in a great supporting role as Hawkins' janitor friend. But with the exception of Hawkins, everyone is still second fiddle so that the merman can shine. The characters are all interesting and all developed, but they fill the necessary gap and not too much more. And in the hands of Pan's Labyrinth (and Pacific Rim, but that doesn't help the guy here) del Toro (who also wrote), the fantastical mythicalness of the merman shines through. It's really quite a spectacle that fits perfectly within his realm

Mystic River," Dark, Brooding, and Brilliant
","I could tell you Clint Eastwood adds sure-handed direction for this film, and while that is true, it doesn't actually tell you anything. What I can tell you is to watch the eyes. This is a story told by the eyes, and the subject matter couldn't have been approached any better.The plot is fantastically construed, but I believe a slight disclaimer is in order. This is a dark film. Don't come in with expectations to be cheered up after a rough Saturday night when Jimmy left you for hot Chris or whatever-- this isn't that film. And hey, a lot of the best films are very dark in nature. If you end up watching Mystic River and think to yourself, 'Wow, that is such an awesome film!' then I also highly recommend the more recent Prisoners. That movie absolutely deserves a review, but not now.Anyways, we are introduced to the 3 principle characters-- Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon-- when they were kids and loved street hockey. Two 'officers' come up to them and take Dave (Robbins) in their car. It's never shown but rather highly implied of what they do to poor Dave. Flash forward to their adult lives, and all three of them have issues. Robbins is still uneasy from the childhood experience, Bacon is a detective whose wife left without a word and calls frequently (without any words either), and Penn is an ex-con. Within the first 30 minutes, Penn's 19-year-old daughter is murdered, Bacon is assigned to the case, and Robbins becomes a suspect. It's a compelling setup with all the ingredients mixed in for a great mystery, and it achieves that but with added emotional punch as well.Anybody who says their heartbeat was normal after viewing this film is flat out lying. Penn is dynamic and on edge, Robbins is a very disturbed character whose own wife questions his sanity, and Bacon rounds it out as the sympathetic old friend. In other hands the film could have even turned sappy with all the crossing paths, but this movie is the exact opposite. It is intense in its calmness. All this combines with a score Eastwood did himself with help from his son and an orchestra.Mystic River. It's a pretty ambiguous title that fits perfectly. There's closure to the film, but so much is left open for interpretation to the audience. And that's what Christopher Nolan films and Lost in Translation, among others, do so well that become my favorite types of movies. Throughout Mystic River is well-developed, well-thought out scene after scene that doesn't want you to see it again the next day or even the next week, but in a year or so, you will be dragged back to the film with the eagerness and anticipation to understand the puzzle fully even if it's missing one piece. Perhaps I have not said enough about the film, or did I give just enough context to make you watch it? Who knows, I'll leave it up to you.

Edge of Tomorrow," I Live, I die, I live again!
","That may be a line from Mad Max: Fury Road, but it fits this film perfectly.
If you are familiar with Groundhog Day and Source Code, then add war and aliens and you get this movie. You have to be very, very careful with this as well. Basically, Tom Cruise is an inexperienced (yeah, that's a first) officer who is afraid of blood, and he gets thrust onto the front lines. It's supposed to be a great victory, even having the name Operation: Downfall. Instead, the Mimics set it up for the world to throw all their soldiers right into an ambush. Then Cruise ends up getting an Alpha's blood mixed in him, granting him its time-manipulating powers. It becomes his job to relive every day, and slowly learn how to defeat the enemies. He meets Emily Blunt, the only person that will believe his situation, and she trains him to be able to defeat the aliens. Since the whole movie has the same day, same scenarios repeated, it's crucial to show enough to the audience without it looking repetitive. And I think this video game-like movie succeeds tremendously.Hardly ever has an editor's job been more important or difficult. The result is very humorous at first at all of Cruise's deaths, but as he grows closer to Blunt and witnesses death every single day with little ability to make a significant impact, the dreading of having to do this again with no escape hits really hard.If you're unfamiliar with Tom Cruise films, I may shun you at first; but do not worry, for I will gradually show more and more of his films (and so many are quite good). It's much more understandable to not know of Emily Blunt. And that is a shame, for she is a talented actress in some great films like The Adjustment Bureau and Looper (okay, she's probably known most for The Devil Wears Prada). Sadly, outside of these characters, there's nothing to cheer over with the supporting cast. But the focus is on the 2 stars, and that's the way it should be.A cool addition to this sci-fi action flick is the exoskeletons worn by the soldiers. Resembling what was seen in Aliens, for the most part, the actors are actually doing stunts and wearing these. There's enough to figure out that it takes a couple of resets to be familiar with how to operate them.One scene I particularly remember in Groundhog Day is Bill Murray at the bar, and slowly he finds the right words to say to make the conversation work; similarly, Cruise suffers many deaths only to be more aware for the next shot where he gets past the obstacle. The pacing is quick, but it also settles down for pondering the dire situation at hand. It's a combination of emotions that I think works very well. All in all, it's just such a fun and smart film that I'm really pleased to see made right.In concludeIn conclusion, this is a good film.In conclusion, this is a film that blends a hearty amount of action, comedy, and drama. I look forward to seeing more films from both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.",9,0,1,12 June 2018
Arrival," A strong film because it was placed in the right hands
","I would honestly compare Villeneuve's visceral punching, yet subtle vision-driven storytelling to that of Alejandro Inarritu (The Revenant, Babel, Birdman). If you want simply solid films built with tension and sometimes delivering thought-provoking plots, Villeneuve is a good choice.So what is Arrival? 12 alien spacecraft vessels with strange, black, oval-like shapes touch down (well, they hover above the ground) around the globe. And one of my favorite things about the film is that it knows people don't want 30 minutes of exposition explaining the backgrounds of the charcaters and why they've been chosen; Amy Adams is a skilled linguist professor, and she's headed toward the spacecraft in under 20 minutes with an established background already setup. She is taken there by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) and accompanied by theoretical something physicist with toned muscles Jeremy Renner.One of the strongest aspects of this film-just like the visually stunning 2049-is the logical flow of events in the film. It makes sense why Adams and Renner are needed for communication, and the way they go about everything is just smart and practical. I'd prefer not describing how they interact with the aliens-even if that comprises a large bulk of the movie-but just know that the plot structure is much more sophisticated than a typical Hollywood summer flick.For a film centering around alien contact, it is incredible to see how rooted in humanity the story is. Much of the conflict arises from trust issues from around the globe and especially China's thinning belief that the aliens are here for peaceful reasons. Their turn towards more aggressive tactics and other countries following suit is where the pickup in pacing comes from. And it's also where the film deviates even more from the norm. If you're watching this film in a personalized setting like on your laptop, put some headphones in and crank that volume up. There's a big reason why this film won an Oscar in sound editing; the effects have to be so precise when so much of the plot relies on a linguist trying to figure out how to properly communicate with mysterious aliens that are humorously named Abbott and Costello (Who's on First reference) by Renner. And instead of having a huge, Hans Zimmer score punctuating the action, there's a much more surreal feel from the lack of Johann Johannsson's score (who works with Villeneuve on practically everything). For example, Adams needs to take a breath of fresh air from the stressful work environment, and as she is outside in the beautiful Montana landscape and she reflects on past exposition regarding her family, the touching flashback only has the sound of wind blowing on the tall grass that Adams is sitting in. The minimalist approach brings the audience in closer to this intimate scene, and we hang on every frame.So this is like a masterpiece? Well, not exactly. Again, technically speaking, it's near perfect like how Inarritu is. But that doesn't necessarily translate to simple entertainment value on screen. These are wonderful kinds of films that can be discussed for hours, but that's not the point of this review. To keep it relatively simple, Arrival is a good film that will keep you intrigued for its duration. But you won't really walk out after the credits and be like, 'Wow, that was great!' Actually, the effect it will have is probably closer to a desire to go get a mocha, sit by a rainy window of a wooden table with comfy, contemporary furniture at that hip coffeeshop that will have a name like The West Side Coffeeshop or Hot Coffee with Cool Friends, and you'll just want to think about life. I will say with about 20 minutes left, the movie had me worried about what strange, complicated direction it was going to take, but then it fooled me and went somewhere else. It's a clever, cool looking film that is logical at every turn (unlike all teenagers in horror movies)-but I'm not sure it's enough to be classified as 'one of the greats.'

The Silence of the Lambs," The Silence of the Praise
","The Silence of the Lambs is only the third movie to win all 5 major Oscars (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is another): Best Picture, Director, Actor (and Anthony Hopkins has some of the least screen time for a best actor winner), Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It is the only horror film to ever win Best Picture, and it made all sorts of money-- staying on top of the box office for like 5 weeks and already having made back its budget in the first. So the data coming in would say that I would probably write a review on how good Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were, and how this is such a landmark horror film that would rival The Shining as being the best ever. But I'm not going to. I believe this movie has been highly overrated, and if you allow me to explain, perhaps you'll end agreeing with me too. When you think about this movie, the first thing you think of is either fava beans or Hannibal the Cannibal. But the star is Jodie Foster... What's her character's name again? Clarence, Karen, Carly? You know what, doesn't really matter. We'll save Jodie Foster for later because Anthony Hopkins is really what this movie is known for. And there's a lot of good to indeed say. His looking right at the camera as his character is introduced, his improv mocking of Foster's accent, his unblinking eyes and famous lines. Oscar Winner? Sure. It's all there. My criticism will be discussed later when we talk about the director. What I will say, however, is that Ted Levine is vitally underappreciated as Buffalo Bill. First, I'm glad to see Teddy in a role that isn't a sheriff or cop. Buffalo Bill's luring of women and skinning his victims already made him a viable villain, but it's his dancing in front of the mirror that takes the crown and serves as the creepiest thing in the film.  Okay, I can't hold back any longer. Gotta talk about how this movie suffers. Over the course of filming, I have no issue with the directing. It's not too special, but it's not bad; the camerawork is a different story. It's inconsistent, sloppy, and moves around too much. It tries creating a style that just doesn't work for the film. The exception is Dr. Lecter's scenes. Everything works there, but it seems like the film basically was built around what happened there. Which brings me to the actual story and the editing. We start with Jodie proving herself in the FBI and toughing it out as a female there. It's brief, and some exposition is quickly thrown in to establish her character because, after all, we have to hurry up and get to Hannibal. Which still doesn't seem totally logical. They go to one of the most dangerous and cunning psychiatrists to help catch the notorious Buffalo Bill, and they send an FBI agent who hasn't even graduated? That doesn't add up for me. Fast forward a scene or 2 and we get introduced to Buffalo Bill. It's a disturbing scene, but now we know who everyone is looking for. So the small amount of film dedicated to detective work really hardly serves any purpose because, after all, let's just get back to Hannibal. However smart the Hannibal scenes may be, they're also predictable. And the music really is more nonchalant than anything, and when you mix it all together, you get a film that really isn't all that scary. It's a cop story with a good, not great, female lead and an unremarkable story, so it all dwindles down to Hannibal. And he's truly a pretty great movie psycho, but surround him in a film that is surrounded around him, and the result is just eh.  The climax has predictable moments, but it was leading up to the tense finish I was hoping for the entire film. And then the decisive moment happened and it was so lame. The redeeming part is how the movie ended because despite my criticism from before, I thoroughly enjoyed the ending. So there is that. But if you want an actually scary film with a cool, strong heroine, go watch Alien, Zero Dark Thirty, or just something else.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Better than what people say
","Dark and brooding. This describes both Batman and Superman. It's also very similar to how the film is shot. This colossal movie takes the opposite approach to Marvel and The Avengers, but that's pretty much how they want to compete with them anyways. A follow-up to Man of Steel, Zack Snyder is once again at the helm. I'm thinking his visual style should be the opening topic.First, let's talk about the introductory 10 minutes. The opening credits is a stylish way to bring Batman's story back, and I enjoyed how it was kept brief with only the highlight moments (if you consider a double-homicide of his parents a highlight) since we all know the story already. The slow-mo works well in opening credits, and it's certainly cool, but Snyder definitely gets excessive with it. My favorite part of the film is what follows immediately afterward-- excluding the fact that Bruce Wayne was driving a Jeep Renegade. My favorite shot as well is in the 9/11-like destruction during the Man of Steel climax, but this time from a different perspective; and as the people dash away from the rubble, Bruce rushes towards it. The entire sequence, in fact, is powerful, for the film does a great job of playing off of one of my biggest complaints about Man of Steel, the destruction. Not only does this introduce the political aspect, but it also provides sound motivation for Bruce as he is unable to save the innocents from the crashing towers. This type of storytelling worked well, and maybe Snyder tried using it more in the form of those dreams/premonitions, but the vague references to comic book story lines didn't pull through in those scenes that may have been added just to put in the trailers. I will say, the one awesome moment is in the Batcave, and off to the side is what is presumed to be a Robin costume with a message from the Joker; don't worry, Snyder, I see you being clever.All right, let's talk us some superheroes. The movie toys with interesting moral dilemmas with Superman, and I still love Henry Cavill, but the overall impact isn't there. There are some cool shots with him still: the people surrounding him with their arms outstretched, and then when he's in space with the sun behind helping to rejuvenate him. On the other side of the two-headed coin (Batman reference), I mean, c'mon, Ben Affleck is awesome. I have always been a firm believer that his directing is far superior to his acting, but don't let that take away from what he does. With the Dark Knight himself, I love the branding. I'm all for it. I was slightly taken aback, however, by the free-spirited use of lethal force employed to take out the goonies. Maybe more interaction would have me more willing to simply say bye-bye to the baddies, but it does retract a little from what Batman usually represents and is used more of a way to set up conflict with Superman. I have no issues with the bulkier suit either; it makes more sense to me as they play with this older version of Batman. Which reminds me, I wasn't as much of a fan as some of my friends were and how they will say how awesome it is, but watching The Dark Knight Returns (animated but still dark) is highly suggested to get more of a full circle of Batman. Oh, and brief shout out to Jeremy Irons. You weren't fully utilized as Alfred, but I look forward to what you will give us in the future.Now we all know this sets up Justice League. And I was the most skeptical about cheap, forced ways of introducing the rest of the lineup, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was smart and to the point. Not sure how their looks are going to turn out, particularly when they get stand-alone films, but that will be a discussion for when the time comes.The other very, very smart move was having Gal Gadot be Diana Prince for the majority of the film instead of Wonder Woman even if how it was handled still felt clunky in areas. The reveal worked in to their favor. But it does leave much to look forward to with future outings.One of the issues I've noticed people have been most split on is Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. The best way I can describe his performance is as unconventional. At moments he was trying too hard to bring a more psychotic, schizophrenic approach, but in the context of the film it was a contrast vastly needed.And that ties into the next topic: Hans Zimmer. When we last saw him in the previous caped entry, his dull performance led me to miss the John Williams theme. One of the best parts of the movie was Zimmer bringing out his creative soundtrack; each superhero got a unique theme, and Luthor's blend of quick violins was pure awesomeness and was a redeeming grace to every scene featuring him because it brought out the character Eisenberg desperately tried to portray.To go back to the visual style, the film is too bleak; the lack of lighting renders some scenes as less effective, like the climax I will describe later. It caused too much straining to know what was presented on the screen instead of doing something like drawing attention to details to treat the observant, smart viewer. There are moments, but there's still a feeling that Snyder had to make sure he appealed to a wide audience, so the more hopeful viewer ends up being dumbed down to size to fit with the marketing. This isn't a dumb film, but a lack of deeper meaning behind visuals doesn't do much to stretch the brain.Before we move closer to the climax, lets talk about Batman scenes versus Superman scenes. I enjoyed Snyder's use of Bruce. Sure, some scenes dragged the run time out a little, but you could tell he was having fun working with such a different character. This is most evident in the action sequences. You know what I'm talking about from the trailers when I say I loved the Batman: Arkham style fighting. As a slight downer, in one of those weird vision scenes, there's a really long, circling take where Batman tosses bad guys all around as they take him on one at a time for the most part. While the long takes are always appreciated, the delicate nature of not wanting to mess up the fight choreography did lead to a held-back effort from the stuntman and actors. With glasses-wearing Clark Kent (still find the disguise lame, but I've had it explained that donning the glasses changes Kent's entire appearance, making it full disguise-- I like that explanation more, but it still seems kind of half-hearted), you'll get your fill of Diane Lane, Amy Adams, and Laurence Fishburne; but nothing better than from Man of Steel comes out, only scenes to propel the plot.Maybe this is a slight spoiler coming in after 2 hours, but if you don't know that Batman and Superman fight and that Doomsday makes an appearance, then you're already a lost cause. Go be like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but change up the story and stay on the island. And now that I have tossed out the people that must have put life on mute for the opening weeks of the film, let's talk. This movie has my favorite use of kryptonite. It makes sense, and Batman uses such a cool array of gadgets during the fight. I will say that the fight was totally unnecessary, but if I'm like anybody that paid to see this, I wanted a fight, and a pretty darn good one I got. I also enjoy the idea of putting Doomsday in. But if you've seen Godzilla, King Kong, or even Clash of the Titans (not the laughable original, doesn't count) and its older brother Wrath, then nothing new is added honestly. Big, huge, ginormous, CGI creature with a menacing roar threatens total destruction. I guess teaming up on him can satisfy the nerd in us, but it went too far over-the-top.I am pleased with the outcome of the film, but the end has its predictable moments. If I had to summarize in one sentence, I would say that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a large improvement over Man of Steel and a very entertaining watch, but it doesn't hold the substance seen in The Dark Knight.",8,3,3,12 June 2018
Blade Runner," More like Blade Jogger, but still obviously influential
","I gotta make sure I throw this disclaimer in near the beginning: Blade Runner is not an action sci-fi flick. Yes, it's from Alien director Ridley Scott who would later give us movies such as Gladiator and The Martian. But Blade Runner is much different. It certainly has sci-fi appeal and influence-- video games such as Final Fantasy VII and Mass Effect clearly took notes from the film, and directors such as Christopher Nolan have cited this film as inspiration, but it also doesn't fall into the trippier territory of films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Based on the cleverly titled book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick (he died before the release of the film, but praised what he saw which was about the first 20 minutes), this movie is much more philosophical. Perhaps Blade Jogger would be a more fitting title-the pacing is very deliberate and not at all what I was expecting. The movie stars Harrison Ford who was determined to not wear a hat because he was just coming from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The year is 2019 and genetic engineering has advanced so far as to create androids, or replicants, that are superior in intelligence and physicality. Their telltale sign is their responses to questions that are supposed to evoke human emotions. Created to work as slaves, replicants have rebelled in off-world colonies (remember this is 3 years from now) and are declared illegal on Earth and are to be terminated (they use the word retired) if found. This is where Ford comes in when it's discovered that 6 replicants have returned to Earth. Obviously, this has all the ingredients to be a thrilling action flick. But it takes a much different direction. Replicants are designed with a failsafe that automatically retires them after 4 years. It produces cool, thinking quotes like, 'It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?' Ridley Scott liked the idea of Ford being a replicant, but Ford has stated that he despised that idea and said that before filming Scott agreed with him that his character is definitely human. Now I won't spoil anything, but I will say that it's a question toiled with during the film. Also, if you watch the movie, watch the director's cut version (which technically isn't fully Scott's cut) because the ending is much much better than the theatrical cut of the film. Really, above sci-fi or philosophical or whatever, I'd describe this film as weird. I'm not sure what you're expecting from the film going in, but it's not what you're going to get. There isn't ever a clear tone established, and this just adds to the difficulty of describing just what the film is. Even the highly-regarded score switches from slow, dark melodies to jazzier moments. I will say, however, probably the most consistent element of the film is the lighting. It's certainly always on the darker side, but all the ways the light comes through in every scene is skillfully crafted. In all honesty I can't even say I'm much of a fan of this film. I didn't care for how it was edited, and some of the sub-plots really were weird. The movie succeeds in getting you to think, but it also makes you wonder what you just watched. I'm not sure how many times or how precisely I can say it, but it's a strange film. Not strange like drug-fueled Trainspotting, and not confusing like Stanley Kubrick, but more cerebral like the very ends of the films 28 Days Later and Sunshine. I can't say you will enjoy this film (possibly because I can't say I enjoyed it), but I'm extremely curious about the sequel, and for that alone it might be worth checking this film out. And in case of rain, make sure to grab yourself a light-up umbrella. Those things are so cool.

Casino Royale," Daniel Craig is Great
","I love love love the opening to Casino Royale. It's a perfect blend of infusing classic Bond while showing the world hey, this is the new direction we plan on taking this series. Admittedly, Daniel Craig is an unconventional look, but his charm will win you over. The parkour of the action sequence is really fun to watch (and Johnny English Reborn basically spoofs it and it's hilarious), but it's the opening scene that puts this as the best intro. The theme is a good song, not great, but fits well; the animation is clever and works well, and that's what puts 'You Know my Name' as the 2nd best theme.It doesn't matter who you are, if you prefer blondes over brunettes, or whatever it may be. Eva Green is the best Bond Girl in the Craig franchise. She brings the wit to match the man in the tux at every step. I'm a fan of Mads Mikkelsen, and he would be the best villain if it weren't for the #1 pick. Judi Dench is a solid choice, and she actually is reprising her role as M from the previous series. Jeffrey Wright also brings quality to the film, so I believe we've settled that the cast works well.As far as story is concerned, there is a lot of good and a little bad. If you have establishing shots of well-known areas, putting title cards to tell you where the characters are currently at is cheap and dubs down the audience; this is something this film avoids even if it's brought into Quantum of Solace solely to make sure that sequel was a disappointment. The point is that you'll almost always see me praise subtlety. That really isn't the case here. I'd probably recommend subtitles actually for this film because details are sometimes given in low voices that's hard to pick up. The plot moves to a new action scene, or the characters suddenly display new motivations; and if you aren't paying attention to everything going on, chances are there will be something confusing. In fact, this was probably around my third viewing of the film and I picked up on new ideas while still being in the dark about others-- there are movies like Inception and The Prestige that work these details and foreshadowing effectively (both obviously Christopher Nolan films), but it's more of an annoyance here. And as we're on the topic of story, the writing and dialogue gets half-credit. The movie is way too choppy, but there are still some great quips:Bond: Vodka-martiniBartender: Shaken or stirred?Bond: Do I look like I give a damn?And my favorite:Vesper (Eva Green): Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?Bond: No, don't worry. You're not my type.Vesper: Smart?Bond: Single.On a final note for the story, I'm a sucker for well-constructed scenes like the development of the poker hands, and the torture scene is one of the best in any film. The confusion I've been referring to is mainly in the last 30 minutes. I'll say no more than that, but it's kind of hard to put a finger on what the goal was or what went wrong. These closing scenes aren't bad-- the climax is an awesome set-- but I don't believe it works to the degree the movie hopes for. Overall, the cast is all solid, but it's not the film's fault that the #1 pick has a better ensemble; what really brings the film down to the 2 slot is some choppy scenes and a confused plot. And if those are the critiques I have to give it, that should tell you that this really is a good film. It gets my recommendation, and if you're somebody who hasn't seen a Daniel Craig James Bond film, there's no better place to start than here.

Spectre," Had potential and had its moments, but there are better Bond films
","Sam Mendes returned as director for the fourth installment of the Daniel Craig James Bond series. With everything from questions of how long Craig would be doing this to what a huge budget the film had, there's lots to discuss.Arguably the best place to start, lets talk about the beginning. Production values are imminent from the opening shots. Although there is hardly a cut or a word for the first five minutes, there isn't really anything special that happens. And this ends up taking a toll when the run-time is just under 2 and 1/2 hours. There's some cool helicopter stunts (with some disbelief of reality put aside), but I still consider this action sequence only the third best. And then you also have to talk about Sam Smith's 'Writing's on the Wall.' His voice is fantastic and the relevance of the animation in accordance with the story is appreciated, but there's some lacking quality that doesn't seem to fit in with a 007 film. And the animation overall didn't strike me as impressive, so I still rank this theme as third best as well.Spectre attempts to tie in the previous films into this plot. I guess there's points for effort, but it doesn't really have a huge emotional connection to pull it off. And there were multiple instances where a scene could've been tidied up or even cut entirely. But no. This movie just had to make it to 2 1/2 hours. It's just really long and a little draining.I think I was still fine with the film up until a snowy mountain sequence where Bond ends up driving like this cargo plane. And as problems arise, the sequence goes into the most Pierce Brosnan-esque style of action-- so over-the-top that it's just like c'mon man.Lea Seydoux adds a nice touch, and Monica Bellucci certainly adds a bit of a surprising element for Bond Girls. Really have no issue there. And then fans of Sherlock will recognize Andrew Scott in the film. Having gained attention as Moriarty, I was intrigued to see him step into a different role... That didn't happen. Pretty sure the producers told him to act almost exactly as Moriarty had. The result is nothing surprising, which is a disappointment and also a little frustrating.But lets talk about what had the most potential overall for the film: Christoph Waltz. After having Javier Bardem kill it as the villain in the previous film, I think Waltz is an excellent choice to bring new elements. But this is easily the worst aspect of any Daniel Craig Bond film. Which pains me so much to say because there's a good deal of build-up. His introduction has great camerawork and lighting, and it creates a mystical veil around the organization and his role behind it. And this lasts for lets say 8 minutes. Then the movie basically forgets about it for a good hour. He's brought back, and it could still be very interesting despite a drop in fanfare. But what was supposed to be a tense, high-production action set-piece is set back with a surprisingly boring backstory for the villain filled with ideas that say 'This is the bad guy and he's bad and he does bad things because he's bad' and unbelievably predictable action. And I guess they make it appear he's dead, but everyone knows that's not the case--even if the run-time is padded already. The climax reminds me of Mission Impossible Rogue Nation if that climax was also filled with cliches. And what I mean by that comparison is that Rogue Nation kind of has their climax setup like a heist, and you don't really feel any tension because you feel like it all is part of the good guys' plans. Spectre is similar to this, and the ignorance and stupidity that leads to the demise of the villain makes me think that the writers just couldn't think of any other logical possibility for a death.Spectre isn't all bad, like the returns of Ben Whishaw as Q and Ralph Fiennes as M were very welcome, but it's a very flawed film that certainly had potential.

Mad Max: Fury Road," Pure Adrenaline-Filled Awesome
","Perhaps the blood rushing constantly doesn't allow you to fully process what you actually just saw, but after checking out the bonus features, you have to realize that besides digitally removing certain things and enhancing colors, every stunt you see was actually performed-- and usually at top speed. I'm talking about blowing up huge trucks, flipping cars, motorists jumping over vehicles, and so much more. Easily my favorite are the pole-rider guys; you may remember them from the trailer on these huge poles to swing from one vehicle to another. Yeah, guys trained for weeks to be able to do that. And I might as well say, kids, no matter how cool it looks, I only give you permission to attempt these stunts as long as you capture it on video so that I can laugh at you later.Now I can go on and on about these epic stunts and explosions and kills and action and fighting, but even that doesn't give the movie full justice, for it is one of the most fully-realized movies ever. George Miller had this brilliant vision, and the product is a story told with hardly any lines spoken by the main character-- or other characters for that matter. The women are given strong roles to emphasize their importance, not feed on weakness, and the message Miller gave his unit was loud and clear and wonderful: Even though this is a post-apocalyptic world, that doesn't mean it has to be bleak and lifeless and bland. This movie is vibrant and beautiful. To put focus on how humans would actually scramble to find remnants of beauty in a forsaken world is a great twist that enhances the story and the experience.Now let's talk about the Oscars. And there's a lot to talk about. This film won 6, all these very technical awards including his wife winning for editing, and nominated for 4 others. Not only did Fury Road win these Oscars, but it had to beat The Revenant to do so. Granted, that masterpiece beat it in directing and cinematography, but that's rightfully so. I think a lot of people were questioning why an action flick was winning all these awards from an academy that is known for excluding action, superhero, and blockbuster flicks. I am so glad it was recognized that this high-octane movie had such a vision that came together like nothing else. It's so hard to compare it to the other Oscar nominated films, but it is also really hard to compare it to action films in general. Generally, you have the opening action sequence, background of characters, perhaps a twist halfway through, then a balance of action scenes and talking scenes with a huge climax. And that is not Fury Road. My favorite vehicle from the armada is the huge cargo truck hybrid with drummers beating on the back and a guitarist suspended with strings jamming out and unleashing flames (it's an actual flamethrower guitar). That to me embodies the movie. A weird, weird world full of rocking characters on a chase set to a score with an equal amount of pounding drums and quick guitar jams. It's so cool, but still so intricate with the suicidal half-lives who follow Immortan Joe.This film changes the game. The progressively more intense sequences keep piling up for some of the most fun you'll ever have at a movie. Will other movies follow suit? And more importantly, how does George Miller create a respectable sequel after this?You can check this review and dozens of others out at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com",9,4,8,12 June 2018
Macbeth," All Hail Macbeth
","If you have ever seen a Shakespeare production, well good for you; but except for understanding the language, it does not prepare you for this ambitious Macbeth. I will include it in the first paragraph because it plays a role more important than any character, and that is our friend Atmosphere. This film utilizes what a stage production could never achieve, and it creates such a distinguished atmosphere.Say, Mr. Gill, what exactly do you mean by atmosphere? I'm talking about mood, I'm talking about tone, I'm talking about presentation! There is a lot of fog and mist to go around, and the camera hardly moves, painting picture-like shots of characters in front of a wide background. It's so visceral and bold and unexpected. Above all, it works. It fits the puzzle beautifully with the vision in-hand.There are plenty of smart choices, such as reducing the lines and spirit of the crazy 3 witches. Instead, they add such a mystical element that's almost taunting to the ticking and complex Macbeth. There's other noticeable changes, but before you traditionalists call foul, don't worry because it's not a change from the source like pre-good DiCaprio Romeo + Juliet is.Okay, the film is perhaps stylish to a fault. If you recall the iconic scene in Mission: Impossible where Tom Cruise sneaks into the white room, you will remember that any sound above a whisper would trigger the alarm. It felt like (with the exception of scenes like the haunting dinner) the entire cast was set to this mode. Although it adds a coolness to many of the lines, I kind of wanted to yell at the screen just to see if the characters would yell back. Oh, and I can't imagine watching the film without the use of subtitles. And on that note, I think every Shakespeare movie is probably enhanced with subtitles to help understand the lines and think them through more thoroughly.I don't think I have talked about makeup in movies as much as I should, so I will add it here. The battle makeup and makeup on Lady Macbeth stand out in a good way, and that is a big accomplishment to the people in that department.Now you just know I wouldn't do a review without mention of the acting. Hey, Harry Potter fans, Lupin is in this film! Okay okay, let's talk Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard. Fassbender is a powerhouse actor, and I think a little more variation in voice would clean up one of Shakespeare's best characters. And one of Shakespeare's best female characters, if not the best, is played by the French Cotillard, an interesting differentiation from the rest of the Scots. Combine these two experienced actors with incredible lighting, and we're back to the atmosphere.I must say how I was engaged for the entire film. It's impossible not to give huge credit for this Shakespeare adaptation that perhaps stands out the most from any of the movies of any of the plays. And yeah, the fighting is like Zack Snyder, but with more purpose. I don't think the opening and ending sequences could have been done better, and for the squeamish, there is enough blood to quench a vampire; but as I stated earlier, it is more meaningful and again adds to the atmosphere. If there's any way to get millenials excited about what a dead guy wrote years ago, it is through this film. And that statement could easily have its downsides, but even the shall we say sophisticated can appreciate what is done. I'd say this film is like Zack Snyder meets Gladiator meets European art, and on most notes, that is pretty good praise.

Sully," Captain Sully
","January 15, 2009. Many remember the date for the 'Miracle on the Hudson.' Crew and passengers totaled 155 as birds flew into the engine of the plane, forcing the captain to land in the Hudson River. Heralded as a hero, people who haven't read the book (including myself) that Chesley Sullenberger proceeded to write about the incident may not be familiar with everything that happened after the memorable day.There's different ways of approaching the material, so let's see how they decided to do it before analyzing the contributions of the individual. The beginning sets up how Sully never embraces the role of a hero and how his mind is tormented about how he saved the lives of everyone, yet the flight committee pushes to know if it was the best and safest decision; Sully reported that he lost both engines and thus wouldn't have thrust to return to a runway, but simulations and data engineers put together state otherwise. The beginning also sets up how Sully has always had a passion to fly and is an experienced pilot with over 40 years under his belt.It isn't until about the 30 minute mark that we get our first glimpses of the day in question. From then on there's a good deal of Sully contemplatively running through New York and reliving the day and the possible outcomes, and then different views of the 208 seconds of fateful flight.This is not the most thrilling movie. It just simply can't be. And it doesn't infuse the amount of enjoyment that Moneyball did with subject matter that could've bored audiences. Nevertheless, that is not to say the movie is boring. Clint Eastwood directs, and he more than anybody ever can direct with such a cool hand. And his directing when it comes to the rescue scenes on the river may be overlooked, but it's truly strong directing. And in typical Eastwood form, expect a lot of subtle piano playing in the film (Eastwood is credited with the theme for the film). It's also worth mentioning that even though many glimpses of the crash (or as Sully puts it, 'forced water landing') are presented throughout the brisk hour and a half, it doesn't get old. There's purpose every time it's shown, and the right amount is shown every time.Tom Hanks stars as the captain who misses his family and truly believes he was just doing his job-- nothing overly heroic. There's some internal demons to battle over the course of the movie, and it may not be Hanks' finest performance, but the everyday-charm and subtleness is still quite a performance. Aaron Eckhart is the clear supporting role, second fiddle character. He's really meant to be the comic relief, and, not all the jokes are the most well-written, but again there's charm for the guy that has his captain's back every step of the way. Laura Linney is never on the screen with Hanks at the same time, but as the distressed wife, they share plenty of phone calls together.Again, this really isn't the most thrilling movie, and there shouldn't be hopes of it being one either. But it is a film shot almost entirely in IMAX cameras and the shots of New York are great; the acting is basically between good and great, and the final act shows the most humanity. Perhaps the film could be likened to Lincoln-- well acted without the most compelling of stories, but instead of Lincoln's ensemble cast, Sully places its bets on the focus of a few individual and that helps it retain the identity of an enjoyable film. It probably doesn't raise to the level needed for any Oscar nod, but it is an enjoyable film. And when you can enjoy a film or the film succeeds in the purpose it set out on, that's a win in my books.
