Black Swan," You have got to be kidding
","This is the worst film I have seen this year. It was annoying, and just awful, The director in his usual ham-fisted 'style' gave us 3 options: It is a disappointing ballet movie, it is part horror and part dance movie and it is a pyscological thriller? It fails completely like all film school-like directors films and is so heavy handed it makes you want to walk out. Ms. Portmans acting consists of 2 expressions grim and crazy grim. The dancing is infantile, with arm waving and spinning around substituting for the real thing. As is true of amateur directors and screen writers, there is NO background given of the lead part, so we have no idea if her actions are real or fiction. It would however make a great film to show film students a showcase film with terrible writing and even worse directing. The dance director is not written skillfully and he is an ass and we have no hint as to why he is the great artist-director of dance, None of the characters are fleshed out as human beings, they are all stock human beings. When one is asked to GUESS what this movie is trying to be, mystery hysterical girl part horror or dream then it is simply not worth wasting your time on.",1,52,132,18 December 2010
Midnight in Paris," Warm wonderful a classic
","After seeing 2 crappy movies Meeks crossing and some Italian so-called thriller (both of which I wanted to walk out on) It was a thrill to see a Woody Allen classic. Owen Wilson was just great, and who would have thought that. The cast was uniformly superb and the issues of life were so very compelling. The theory of the movie was that we are all unhappy with being in the present and wish we could return to a 'perfect' era. Thus does Wilson LOVE Paris and Paris at Midnight which leads to some wonderful escapades,This is a master at work, and in the full prime of his talent. This will be a classic. Both my wife and I would like to see it again, which we never do.",10,3,12,27 May 2011
Closer," Really, Really BAD!!!
","I have been in a committed relationship for many many years-IE I am MARRIED--I thought I could never HATE a movie as much as this one. I hardly know where to start. This movie has no concept of what real men-women relationships are like. The script was disjointed and clumsy, it had no concept of how to do flashbacks, the story line was so confusing but even MORE irritating. If the great Mike Nicols was a filmstudent I would gleefully give him an F--he should be ashamed of himself. I never once thought the 4 actors were REAL HUMAN BEINGS--I thought if them as Jude Law, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman--it is of course no surprise to me that Julia Roberts is a miserable Actress with no range or ability to convey emotion or any other human feeling, but I kind of liked Miss Portman before this movie, but she was so AWFUL she made the star of Showgirls seem like a superb actress--this performance should be placed in concrete, never to be seen in the world again. This movie should a lesson for all pretentious film students--it should be shown to every film student in the world as one of, if not the worst Hollywood movies ever made--filled with god-awful claptrap. As for the playwright=screen writer I never want to hear or see any of his work ever again.",Null,1,3,20 December 2005
Capote," A great film
","A beautiful film, A great cast, with an award winning performance by PSH, a tourdeforce of capturing the essential Capote without making him a cartoon{which is what he came across as in his public appearances, people laughed at him and cringed at his persona}. Katherine Keener is as always a solid professional with a wide range of talent. The photography is simply breathless, capturing the vast lonely fields of Kansas. The only false note was Perry Smith--the actor portraying him was too pretty and sensitive. By far the better performance was by Bobby Blake who brought forward the menance and cheap criminal aspects of this guy, The actor in Capote except for the scenes in which the murders were portrayed came across as a simpering, weak zero. I didn't believe for one second that this person was a killer. As for the other criminal he as deeply portrayed in the earler fim. This movie was therefore unbalance but I suppose the director wanted to emphasize the relationship between Capote and smmith. One warning I am not now nor ever have been a film student-- therefore I don't like some films regardless of who made them.",Null,0,1,7 October 2005
Disturbia," It falls apart
","I saw this flick on net flix. I rented it primarily because of Shia Leboeuf. It started out interestingly as a thriller, starting slowly and developing some tension following the Rear Window routine, gradually letting the audience in on various secrets. David Morse was good as a suspect, affable but menacing. It also, in the first two thirds of the movie avoided gore blood, etc. I like the characters except for SLs friend who I think was grossly over the top and way too fey. The girl lead was intriguing, but not fleshed out enough as a person. THEN at the last one-third of the movie it fell completely apart degenerating into an obvious slasher--just awful. I say don't see this movie,unlike Fracture it just isn't interesting enough to waste your time on.",4,1,3,13 August 2007
Unknown," A terrible awful movie
","My wife felt this is one of the worst films we have ever seen, I agree. I am tired of Hollywood whiz and bang and this was the worst. Car after car after car was destroyed (yawn) and the plot line was repeated over and over and over again. The ending was stupid made no sense whatsoever and as usual in Hollywood action films NONE of the characters were given any background and the writing was simply horrendous. Taken was a mildly enjoyable thriller, but this was just garbage. Neeson had a particular profession but seemed to lack any knowledge when pressed for answers. This is just one of the stupid aspects of this god-awful film and the crash scenes were very poorly executed. We both felt that this movie should contain a warning about it--do not waste a precious 2 hours of your life on this piece of absolute crap.",1,8,18,21 February 2011
The Illusionist," An entertaining though flawed film
","I was in the mood for a period piece, so I enjoyed the costumes and Prague scenery. My wife doesn't like them and said she had no sense this was the 19th century and that Norton and Giamotti were too modern. I thought it was VERY old fashioned with a typical Hollywood ending. There was no passion or spark between Biel and Norton and I didn't feel anything real about their relationship. The villain was pretty good, evil without overacting. There weren't too many other characters involved so it was more like a stage play, and there was a great deal of action. The effects were not great. It wasn't pretty enough to see on a big screen although we always enjoy the ARClite. Wait for the rental.",Null,1,1,18 August 2006
There Will Be Blood," A strange absorbing film
","P. T. Anderson makes an old-fashioned film completely different from his other films. This is a story of an oilman around the turn of the last century, a man who is driven by ambition greed, and hatred for his fellow men. He is really a huckster conning landowners out of their mineral rights by the sheer strength of his personality, and his ability to answer any question they might ask, and satisfying their poverty-driven greed by promising them untold wealth. He is opposed only by an impossibly young preacher who tries to help his people, but fails. The movie revolves around the evil,power struck, hater of men played by Daniel Day-Lewis. His morality knows no bounds and he is willing to do anything, including cold-blooded murder to gain what he wants. The film is great in showing the plight of the land-owner and working class of Americans during this period. It is epic in all places, acting writing directing music, photography. PT Anderson and Lewis are GREAT film-makers. Everyone should see this film.",9,2,9,3 January 2008
American Gangster," Not as good as I expected
","After all the hype, I expected more. It is way too long for a simple story. It is too derivative with steals from Godfather, Good Fellas and number of other gangster films. The revelation to me was a great performance by Crowe, probably his best. He played it perfectly--an underplayed restrained but in the end a magnificent job of acting. I never realized how really good he is as an actor, He plumbed the depth of this good cop and yet made him all too human, showing his angst as well as his moral certitude. For once he did not rely on his persona and charm. Acting students should see him if they want to see a big star show how really good a star can be!! I admire him for stopping to give such a great acting job in the middle of a star-laden career. Denzel also gave a wonderful performance. Even though he relied on his superb electric personality. Any film he is in is usually worth watching. He is at the top of his craft, here going from suave polished kingpin to savage killer.But the rest of the cast except for Brolin is wasted. He gives another amazing acting job and shows he is a top professional. The film was poorly edited and Zalians script was Disjointed and character development other than the leads was non-existing. It is surely worth seeing for the two stars work but because of the poor writing and editing it doesn't rise to the level of the great crime films.",7,1,7,3 November 2007
La Vie En Rose," A mish Mosh
","The only thing more annoying then Edith Piof was the movie itself, It made no sense what soever, and other then her awful childhood, gave us NO understanding of EP as a human being, I got the distinct feeling from watching this movie that she had NO redeeming qualities as a person. One would think from her earlier life that she would have sympathy and understanding of others, but she spent the whole movie acting like an awful screaming spoiled rotten child. She spent her career using dope and alcohol and issuing demands to her agent and her staff, though it is hard to understand why anyone would work for her. Her relationship with Cerdan seemed completely unreal and not close to her character. They completely ignored her WWII history where it has been intimated she was a collaborator, with Mauric e Chevalier. The way the movie was put together was completely confusing-- without a doubt the WORST biopic in the modern era. The actress did well, because she was annoying too. When she started screaming a name of someone, I felt like yelling 'shut up' ASs usual with auteur the movie was too long. Save over 2 hours of your life and don't see or rent this really BAD french dud.",Null,4,12,22 June 2007
Moonrise Kingdom," Another wonderful indie
","I wish that Hollywood made entertaining films and I always look forward to films Like Marigold Hotel, safety not guaranteed and this quirky classic. I've admired Wes since Bottle Rocket and I really think this is his best. From start to finish, not a single false note was present, and like the other 2 films satisfying with a capitol S.. The cast is superb. The thing that sustains me is there are film makers who tell stories which relate to us as people. This film is a fairy story, but the 2 kids are so wonderful its easy to think it is real. To have stars like Bruce Willis and others lend their talent to a film like is simply wonderful. None of these 3 films are copycats unlike the endless crap like John Carter, a film that cost 250 million, and yet the imbeciles who made it didn't have enough brains to make a title. John who cares. The mind numbing garbage 3D films that have horrible scripts and do 11 sequels. Guys like Anderson and many others can write like their old film counterparts. Now it is techs who use phony cgi as the backbone of their bottom feeding garbage My wife says thank heavens there are men and women who can write and who care about film as art!!",10,2,4,15 June 2012
Munich," Spielberg has lost it
","Another disappointing effort from the director of Schindlers List his last good movie. Private Ryan started fantastic then fell apart, Now, ALL of Spielbergs movies are way way too LONG,he has become a classic egoist and makes no attempt to edit his flms or make them taut. Although not as horrible as Ron Howard whose sugary pap and inability to restrain himself, and whose goody morality is really awful, Spielberg has become a ham-handed movie-maker who makes a point, and then with contempt for even the general audience, makes it over again to make sure they got it. If ever anybody is riding on his reputation it his guy. The movie fails even on the basic thriller level, the background of the agents is shallow, and though many boring minutes are spent doing nothing, explaining the reasons why these agents do what they do is lacking. That the main protagonist would be sent by the toughest agency in the free world to do what he is s ent to do is ridiculous. A really fake Hollywood agent. I can say do not see this fim except by rental at home--this doesn't even rise to the level of a good t.v. movie. Perhaps, after seeing the New World before this film, made by a master of wit,sensetivity artistry and of unitingsound music and picture and with real genius was too much and overwhelmed Spielbergs pedestrian skills.",5,3,15,29 December 2005
