Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid was directed by George Roy Hill in 1969 during the New Hollywood era of film making. This American western is full of action with added subtle slapstick comedy intertwined. Starring Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy) and Robert Redford (The Sundance kid) as two bank robbers trying to survive the only way they know how. The message being transmitted is the importance of friendship and loyalty. Through the good and the bad, the two outlaws are in it together never to leave the others side until the end. This isn't a typical western, the screenplay was written to focus on more than just violence and criminal life, but also in-depth character development to really feel like you know them. The finished product is unique, giving the early 1900's a more modernized feel.",8,0,1,7 December 2010

Once they reached the 'promise land' (california) they find that it wasn't promising after all. the work and living conditions they find could be compared to the concentration camps during the Holocost. They are slaves in a free world and don't know enough to walk away. The Grapes of Wrath is a long and depressing movie.,6,0,1,24 October 2010
