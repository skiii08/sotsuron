Howl's Moving Castle," I'm about to get slammed, but.....
","I just don't get it. Like Stephen Hunter, I don't understand what all the fuss is about.I'm the first to admit that I simply don't care for this style of Japanese animation (not that it is different from the style of animation in most similar animated movies.) It's simply substandard and inadequate for the depth of feeling in the story. Sorry! After all, I'm the guy who can't watch 'Spiderman', or 'The Hulk' or any of the newer films that rely heavily on CGI because it looks so fake and unnatural. The same goes for this film. It's just an intolerable style of animation framed with a so-so story. I keep expecting Speed Racer to come to the rescue.Sorry! Flame on!",4,7,21,12 June 2005
The Big Lebowski," I just don't get it.
","TBL is not a terrible movie, but I apparently just don't get it. My lady-friend's daughter is always telling her that she should see TBL in order to understand some of the 'in-humor' and comments of her generation. I kept telling my friend that I really didn't think that the movie would be what she expected, but we watched it together anyway. (I had already seen it a couple times.) My friend was flabbergasted, as she couldn't identify any phrases, humorous scenes, or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughter's group use. She didn't like the movie, either, and was actually checking to make sure that it was the same movie her daughter had recommended.I feel the same way. Frankly, this movie is boring and pretentious. I love most of the Coens' work, but not this film. It goes into a category, along with 'Young Frankenstein', of movies about which other people make a fuss and I just don't get. Maybe I'm slow.Anyway, if your idea of fun is watching a laid-back dude drink White Russians and a lot of unnecessary one-dimensional characters get layered on, go ahead. It's just not my cup of tea.",4,43,82,9 March 2009
Hostel," Better than expected, but much too tidy.
","I expected a non-stop gore-fest, but (thankfully) the gore was reasonably limited and confined to a small portion of the movie.On the other hand, Roth seems to have given in to his producers...or paid too much attention to the results of the advance screenings, it's hard to tell which. The film is much too tidy and works too hard to dull the effects of the gore by tempering it with a sense of poetic justice.The skanky addicts who lure the victims towards their horrible and lingering deaths? Don't worry...we'll run them (all three) over on the way home through town.The sadistic Dutch businessman? No problem...we'll have a chance to slit his throat during a chance encounter in a public restroom.Offended and sickened by the twisted American businessman? Never fear...he'll be in he first torture chamber you escape to (after he's thoughtfully turned his handgun over to you).And so forth and so on....All in all, the exact opposite of the 'Saw' movies.",5,1,1,1 May 2006
Public Enemies," A bit of a disappointment....
","You've been living under a rock if you don't already know quite a bit about Mann's latest film.I'll just add that I was disappointed in several aspects of the film. This is unfortunate, as I consider myself somewhat of a fan of Mann's.The first negative is the emphasis on overt melodrama. (This is quite ironic, since there are several scenes from 'Manhattan Melodrama,' the last film that Dillinger saw, in the movie. It's almost as if Mann was overtly telling the audience that this would be a MM for the 2000s.)Also, I wouldn't mind the cornpone storyline so much if it were historically accurate. Unfortunately, it is not. It is one thing to fantasize about characters in a fictional story (as in 'Heat'), but Dillinger, and virtually all the other characters in this movie, were real people and they did real (and, in most cases, historically verifiable) things. The non-fictional aspects of the Dillinger story are exciting enough. Why was it necessary to jazz them up for this movie? It certainly wasn't done to improve the pacing of the story.Finally, what's with the sound and the cinematography? Mann, and others associated with the film, state that the quality of the digital photography was deliberately chosen and used for effect. What? The rectangular digital anomalies (like photocopy screening) were deliberate? What was that supposed to represent? Wire news photos? This just looked bad...and cheap. Plus, the sound is terrible. Forget the mumbling and just turn on the captions. As for the sound overall and the sound FX, they were nowhere near as convincing as in 'Heat.' The weapons used in 'Heat' sounded like actual weapons being fired on the streets of LA. The weapons in 'Public Enemies' sound like canned sound FX bought on-line. You never once believe that a shotgun or Tommy gun is being fired.Other than my complaints, not a bad movie. Depp does a pretty good job, as do Crudup and Bale. (Though they should have just given up and told Bale to drop the accent.) Everyone else is pretty forgettable.Frankly, I prefer John Milius' 1973 version of the Dillinger story with Warren Oates. Check it out.",7,2,4,6 January 2010
Spider-Man 2," How bad can CGI get?
","I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but I suspect that many of you have been watching too much anime. The CGI work in this movie is possibly worse than that in 'The Hulk', which I thought had set an all-time low. The lack of attention to detail and the cartoonish characteristics of the CGI images are just appalling and reflect a total lack of any concern for realism. As I have said in other reviews, it IS possible to do good, realistic, seamless CGI. Check out the now-venerable 'Jurassic Park', which made every CGI dinosaur a work of art.With that said, the acting is good, the plot is superior to that of 'Spiderman', and the pacing is very good.Just, please....stop hurting my eyes with 10-cent CGI! Sam, whatever you're paying for the FX, you're paying way too much.** out of ***** due to incredibly inept CGI",5,1,3,16 April 2005
Troy," My, my, my...aren't we a bit prickly about this film?
","And I thought that the people writing about Halle Berry's 'Catwoman' were defensive.It seems to me that we have several camps of critics reviewing this film. Mr. Ebert represents this film as an insult to Homer and a bastardization of a legendary piece of literature. Others complain about the screen time that Brad Pitt has as Achilles. Let's just address these two issues for now.First, let's admit that Homer's work is based on legend and that most legends have at least SOME basis in fact. I think that Petersen does a pretty good job of filming a story that may have been the basis for the legends: The siege of Troy lasts several weeks, but is soon exaggerated to 10 years. Achilles is the greatest warrior, but is mortal like everyone else and dies in a manner that gives birth to legends about his parentage. The war itself is built on the pretext that Agamemnon is upholding Greek honor after Helen is stolen, while actually providing the excuse he needs to expand his kingdom. What's wrong with that? At least Petersen isn't depicting blue-painted Pict women fighting alongside the men.Second, Achilles IS a major character. He was a major character in Homer's poem and is a major character of Greek mythology. But I really don't think that he gets that much more screen time than do Hector and Paris. He's egotistical, a braggart, and a vicious fighter, all qualities I would expect in a famous warrior. Virtually all films 'based on events' must focus on one or two individuals. Otherwise, you end up with 'The Longest Day,' where all the characters enter and leave in just a few minutes.Now, I do have some criticisms. Whereas Petersen tries hard to stay realistic about in portraying the basis for the legend, I think he makes a mistake in depicting 'a thousand' Greek ships. After all, just beaching the ships with minimum spacing between them would take over 4 miles of beach.I give this film *** out of *****.",6,1,2,10 January 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," OK, let me throw in MY little complaint about the movie.
","Granted, the whole massive-climate-change thing is ludicrous, the hike to New York on what must be at least 30 feet of snow is crazy, and the huge waves that come into Manhattan without doing much damage to the buildings is unrealistic.BUT, what I want to know is this: Why do people freeze so fast? The air can't be THAT cold. Cold air has to come from somewhere, it's not just manufactured by elves down in caves somewhere. The coldest air available to be swept down into the lower latitudes would be polar air, which rarely gets cold enough to freeze exposed skin instantly and kill a person. Even if we got some butt-freezing arctic air, it would be warmed at least a little by ambient ground temperature, the Atlantic Ocean, and the little bit of sunlight that gets through the cloud cover. But that's OK because Dennis Quaid seems to be immune to it anyway.** out of *****",3,0,2,4 January 2005
The Prestige," Darn...I really wanted to like this movie.
","I have not read the book and so I suppose I should so I can give the story a fair shake. But the whole 'Tesla and His Miraculous Achievements' aspect of the story, which is absolutely crucial to the plot, just turned me off like one of Tesla's bulbs.With all due respect to a great man, Tesla was largely a showman...just like Edison and many other inventors and scientists of his day. Self promotion was the rule and, given the opportunity, they would gladly explain (or imply) that they could power vehicles at great distances, create earthquakes, and perform similar miracles. The idea that Tesla either discovered some natural force or designed an elaborate machine (remember, while there were some primitive vacuum tubes in development prior to 1900, it was only after the turn of the century that they became practical for use in electronic circuits) to accomplish 'The Prestige' is so bizarre that it basically doesn't even rise to the level of deus ex machina.So, as we say here in NC, the movie was 'fairly well ruin't' for me at that point.I was also disappointed in the basic absence of any period magic or sleight of hand. There were a few examples here and there, just the minimum to try to establish credibility, but it was pretty tame and not at all of any interest.As far as the production and acting, that's the only reason it got as high a score from me as it did. Jackman was a so-so, Bale did OK (unfortunately, you really need to watch through to the end to appreciate his acting), and Bowie was a surprising, but good, choice as Tesla.Definitely not a DVD to purchase and I'm not sure that I would even rent it if I had known a bit more about it.",4,3,6,22 February 2007
Final Destination 2," Out-Omens 'The Omen' and 'The Omen 2'
","A much better film than it has any right to be.  As other reviewers have stated, the FX and the DVD video transfer are excellent.  The first FD actually made an effort to philosophize about death and the inevitability of fate, but FD2 quickly dispenses with that and heads straight for the fun buffet.Now, down to the nitty-gritty...doesn't everyone see the homage to the 'Omen' movies here?  Damien was always knocking off his enemies in the most surprising and convoluted ways.  Remember the 'elevator cable' scene?  FD and FD2 simply extend this a bit and build a different framework around the death scenes.  There's also more than a bit of the 'Dr. Phibes' movies here. We enjoy seeing the imaginations of the director and writer(s) at work, as they concoct more an more outrageous scenarios for Death to get back in the game.(Now that I think about it, that same approach has kept the James Bond films coming long after the franchise should have been put to sleep.)Last, but not least, I really don't have much patience for anyone who's complaining about how unreal or contrived the death scenes are.  For Pete's sake, people, we're talking about a movie that personifies Death as having purpose, motivation, excellent planning, and great recovery! If you can buy that, then you shouldn't be complaining about flying barbed wire.I give this a 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,21 August 2003
Alien," I don't normally respond to other reviewers, but...
","Kristine's (kristinedrama14@aol.com) comments puzzle me a bit.  She admits she found this movie to be 'creepy,' that the acting is 'good,' and that Sigourney Weaver 'kicks ass.'  However, the movie is apparently ruined for her because of the technical errors, which are apparently not up to some undefined standards (Star Trek: TNG, maybe?)She points out some issues she has, especially the presence of 'gravity' on the ship, and then states that she could have told the film-makers how to make more than half of the movie much better.OK...I'll bite, Kristine.  What would you change?  I'm genuinely interested.Regarding your other issues, I agree that the presence of 'gravity' on the ship is indeed a bit of a stretch, but I think that you would have been just as upset if there had been some long discourse on how they achieve this at that point in the future.  (I don't recall that 'Solaris' ever took time to explain THEIR gravity.)  As far as your other complaints....Any planet with sufficient mass is going to have gravity similar to earth's. Why would they need 'super suits'?The Nostromos is a space-going tug.  It is SUPPOSED to be in minimal condition, with water leaks, faulty lighting, undependable systems, etc. One of the director's goals was to show 'unglamorous' commercial activity in space.  It's the equivalent of an old ocean-going freighter with a pick-up crew.So, lighten up, Kristine!OK, with all that out of my system, let me say that this is a classic movie. It is one of those rare movies that is much better in the theater with other viewers, since their reactions feed your own.  DO NOT MISS THIS RE-RELEASE!!",Null,0,1,31 October 2003
The Polar Express," Creeepy, creepy, creepy...
","The crummy PC story (changed substantially from the original book) is bad enough, but the characters are so creepy-looking in the 'semi-animation' that I can't stand to watch them for more than a few minutes at a time. This movie is genuinely scary and I can't believe that there aren't quite a few kids who have been having nightmares that are populated by these...whatever they're supposed to be. Thankfully, this movie has not started a trend in this direction and I'm spared having to watch a remake of 'Charlotte's Web, as acted by the patient population of the Home for the Criminally Zombified'.An experiment with a bad animation technique that turned out only slightly better than it deserved.Watch 'A Christmas Story' Instead.",4,2,5,16 March 2006
Burn After Reading," A bad Coen Brothers movie is still better than most other movies.
","If this film weren't identified with the Coens, it might have rated a bit higher, both in my opinion and in the opinions of other reviewers. But the Coens have a lot of talent, making some extraordinary films, and we have come to expect more from them this.BAR is all clever and no polish. The casting is OK, but nothing to brag on. (Most actors would sign-up for a Coens film without giving it much thought or even reading the script.) The acting is about average for the star-power involved, with Pitt (surprisingly) being the stand-out. The cinematography is just ho-hum. Long-time Coens collaborator Deakins is sorely missed. Several of the scenes have a sense of desperation about them that seems out of place. (For example, the scene with 'the chair' is just not very funny and really doesn't contribute anything to the story or character development. And it seems totally inconsistent with Clooney's character.) The clever plotting and story-line are what save this from being rated much lower. Everything ties together pretty neatly and leaves you feeling smug and self-satisfied. (I think the scenes at the CIA office are priceless.) Recommended for people who enjoy black comedy and clever crime capers, but be warned: BAR seems more like it was written by the Coens and handed over to someone else to direct and edit.",6,3,5,30 January 2009
The Thing," An amazing piece of work!
","'The Thing' and 'An American Werewolf in London' demonstrate what you can do with some puppets, latex, fake fur, and red syrup.  And I mean this in the most respectful way.Undoubtedly Carpenter's greatest accomplishment, 'The Thing' is a different sort of horror movie.  For one thing, there are no female roles...none, nada, zip.  In fact, there really aren't even any 'weak' male parts. There are no individually identifiable victims or threatened individuals.  Instead there's a strange 'socialism of terror' that comes out in teenage slasher movies and Twilight Zone episodes about the end of the world.  It's also different in that the special effects DO (as stated in several other reviews) drive the plot.  The crew of the station react to the terrifying (and often bloody) situations with a stunning combination of mystified disbelief, bravado, terror, and resignation.The beauty of this film, and where it differs from the earlier version, is that the threat to the crew is based in what is also their strength.  Up until the very last frame of the film, the men must desperately rely upon each other for their safety and security.  Yet the threat in their midst is so dangerous precisely because it preys on this need to trust others.  The men are able to destroy the creature by various means, but only when they can identify it.I won't bore you further.  See this film.  The DVD version with the commentary and features on the making of the film is a 'must-have'.",Null,0,1,14 May 2003
"I, Robot"," CGI Goes on Rampage, Viewing Public Loses
","To paraphrase a famous jurist, I may not be able to define 'too much CGI,' but I know it when I see it. And this movie has too much CGI.When 'Jurassic Park' was released, it defined a new level in CGI. The dinosaurs were of high quality and moved in an appropriate manner. But then every producer got on the CGI bandwagon and we soon had movies like 'Spiderman,' where the CGI is quite obvious. 'The Hulk' was probably the lowest point for CGI as the main character was rendered in a manner only slightly superior to Saturday morning cartoons.In addition, directors and producers completely abandoned the laws of physics, permitting characters to make completely unrealistic actions with regards to momentum, inertia, and kinetic energy. (In 'Jurassic Park,' great care was taken that the creatures moved in a manner and at a speed commensurate with their physical size and mass.)Sad to say, 'I, Robot' is the most extreme example of this trend that I've ever watched. The CGI effects are shoved right in your face. They are distractingly cartoonish, with little effort made to render surfaces and motion in a realistic manner. Human characters take falls that are simply impossible to recover from, while taking corners at g-forces that would pop your eyes right out of your sockets.When CGI becomes THIS intrusive and unrealistic, the move shares the same fate.",3,3,6,4 January 2005
Jarhead," Perhaps it helps to remember...
","that 'Jarhead' is based on a book written from one man's point of view after serving as a Marine. I suspect that the movie (and book) say more about Swofford's personality and what was meaningful to him during his service than what the Marines are actually about. I have not served in the military myself, though many friends and acquaintances have. They confirm many of the factual aspects of the film, but demonstrate a completely different understanding and perspective of the experience.Does military service include long periods of boredom? Sure. But just think, for example, of the number of troops in WWII who spent literally years away from home, with only written correspondence to connect them to friends and loved ones. Many of those NEVER saw combat and (quite frankly) may have had little or no effect on the outcome of the conflict. Not all Marines (perhaps not even a large portion) ever fire their weapons in anger at an enemy.Ultimately, my impression is that Swofford has the type of selective memory common to many college students, who seem to remember the drunken parties, the sex, and the fraternity hazings best. Other students remember the more valuable aspects of the college experience, especially when they appreciated the opportunities at the time they attended college. I suspect that Swofford is accurate and factual in most of what he describes, but it does not paint a complete picture of the Marine experience anymore than a John Wayne film does.OK, back to the film. It's also boring as hell and should never have been made by Mendes. There is no need to watch it.",2,4,5,4 November 2009
Collateral," Mann is still unable to end a movie strongly.
","---THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!!---Mann has made a very good movie, but, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the ending is clichéd and silly. His other movies share this problem. Inevitably, the protagonist survives and (usually) gets the girl.In order to make this happen, Mann has to invest Max with the most unlikely equanimity and a phenomenal natural skill with weapons. He also has to make Vincent, a practiced and well-trained hit-man, act like an idiot with suicidal urges.To be fair, this is really Stuart Beattie's fault. I guess he has been watching too many 'Die Hard' movies. But I would have thought that Mann would have insisted on a little more reality (hmmmm...maybe I mean a more realistic unreal plot) and authenticity. This is even more mysterious because Mann had no problem killing off main characters and love interests in the 'Miami Vice' series.I would have given this movie another star if Vincent had ultimately killed the prosecutor and then said something philosophical to Max before simply walking away. The evening and morning would simply bookend a night in which many characters enter Max's life, change it, and then disappear forever, leaving him a changed man.*** out of *****",6,57,108,31 December 2004
Cross of Iron," Poor effort on Peckinpah's part.
","I am dumbfounded by the great length of several of the reviews posted about this movie.It is a mediocre movie by a great talent.  Many of the philosophical and political comments made here would be apropros to the book upon which it is based, but the movie is a mere shadow of the book.  I see no profundity in the movie itself and none of the imagination of some of Peckinpah's other work.I can't recommend this movie to any but the most die-hard Peckinpah fan.  It has taken me several years to watch the movie completely through to the end as I simply fall asleep during the repetitive battle scenes and the poorly-written dialogue.",Null,1,6,29 May 2003
Aliens," I agree...this is a ***** out of *****
","'Aliens' was the movie my wife and I rented for our first date. It's 'our' movie. But I don't think that this is only the reason I love it so much.The FX are absolutely stunning. Virtually flawless and basically CGI-free. The attention to detail set a high bar that few other films have matched.The actors and actresses are excellent in their roles. Weaver is the most prominent, but you gotta love Paxton's portrayal of the smart-aleck Pvt. Hudson, who ultimately goes down in an almost heroic manner, fighting and defiant until the end. Henriksen is also spot-on in what will probably be his defining role as a supporting character.The script is a masterpiece. Every time I read the 'Quotations' in the IMDb entry, I just crack up.Do yourself a favor and rent or buy the Special Edition and watch it on the biggest screen you can with true 5.1 audio. You absolutely won't regret it.***** out of *****",10,1,2,17 January 2005
Saw III," Tiresome....
","I suppose that, on a technical level at least, this is a competent movie. It just doesn't seem as if the Saw series is going anywhere. The motivation in S1 was a bit novel and interesting. In S2, it got to be pedantic and overextended. In S3, it just seems pointless. OK, OK...we're ultimately teaching people how to care and be compassionate. I get it. The slight variations and twists that S3 holds for us are not enough for us to generate any genuine concern. Even the 'surprise' deaths at the end are just not of any real interest.Shawnee Smith is over the top and Mcfadyen (almost unrecognizable in this role) is pretty ham-fisted as a protagonist. Tobin Bell is, well, Tobin Bell...same as always.About the only difference in shading in this movie is that many of the deaths are not only bloody, but ultimately devoid of meaning or hope. I couldn't help but think about Final Destination 2. In FD2, the characters figure out that Death is coming for them, but in _reverse_ order from how they were originally supposed to die. In S3, the motivations of the primary killer are, unlike in the S1, actually based on a need for violence and vengeance. It's an attempt at a cinematic flea flicker play...and it doesn't come off.",4,3,5,22 February 2007
Quantum of Solace," I'm glad I'm not given to epileptic seizures...
","When are film-goers going to get a break from this silly shaky-cam school of shooting and editing action sequences? The cuts are so fast and so jumpy that I swear I should be on the ground with a rolled magazine between my teeth to keep me from biting my tongue. Once, directors and editors took pride in making as few cuts as possible in action sequences, or they went out of their way to hide the cuts. This enhances the credibility of the scene substantially, as well as providing suspense for the viewer, since he/she has a good 'feel' for the situation in which the protagonist finds him/herself. This approach has apparently been totally canned recently.Overall, this is not a really bad action movie (on the order of, say, 'Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crystal Skull) but it is not a good action movie. It is, however, a very bad James Bond movie.Not recommended.",5,6,9,4 December 2008
The Love Guru," Shouldn't we have Pro, Semi-Pro, and Amateur categories?
","Movies like TLG make me wish that we could rate movies on different scales, similar to Pro, Semi-Pro, and Amateur sports teams. (I think we could sneak a Schoolboy category in as well.) If we rated TLG in the Pro category, which I believe to be appropriate, it would get one star (or zero stars, if we were permitted to do so.) It is THAT bad and that much of a disappointment coming from Mike Myers. If, on the other hand, we ranked it in the Amateur category, it probably deserves five or six stars.But we can't do this. The only reason that I give TLG three stars is that there ARE much worse movies out there. But most of these have been made by dilettantes with cameras. TLG was a serious effort made with a serious budget.And I have to admit that I never really cared much for Myers, either in SNL or in any of his previous movies. (I'm one of the few people for whom Austin Powers does nothing.) But leaving that aside, TLG is just not funny and not even interesting.Not worth your time. Believe me.",3,1,6,19 December 2008
JFK," Of interest only to conspiracy buffs.
","At the beginning of Cocteau's 'La Belle et La Bete,' the director asks us to suspend our disbelief and to become child-like in order to fully enjoy the film.  Stone asks much the same of us here.I know that I will not be able to convince any conspiracy buffs that there are any factual errors in this film.  After all, if you set the bar for evidence sufficiently low, then you can prove anything you care to.This film achieve its effectiveness simply by dramatizing 'evidence' in the most non-critical way.  You can see the same thing done in reruns of 'Unsolved Mysteries.'  The producers of both this movie and that TV show have the luxury of re-enacting the incidents in any manner they choose. Indeed, this is exactly what you experience when you watch this movie.  You have the continuous feeling that you are part of a 'big act' that is constructed to ensure that you believe the party line.  The movie is really that unsubtle.(And I have to say that some of the other reviewers appear to have a rather odd definition of 'fact.')  Oliver Stone has done some outstanding work directing and writing.  I hope that he will not be remembered for this voyage into what is basically yellow journalism.* out of ****",Null,5,18,2 September 2003
The Hurt Locker," Unfortunately, somewhat of a disappointment.
","THL is a good movie, make no mistake about that. It's just not a great movie. Perhaps I was just expecting more, since so many people have talked excitedly about the accuracy of the movie. (Check the forums if you want to learn more about this.) Overall, while I enjoyed the storyline and got the point of the movie, the lack of realism in the movie spoiled it quite a bit.Now, I'm not talking about whether or not chevrons, patches and insignia were shown properly on the uniforms. I'm talking about the lack of security when the EOD team goes out on a mission, the stupid things they do, how they end up in completely unrealistic situations and (quite frankly) the bogus explosions that are used too often. These are NOT trivial problems, as the director and writer use them to emphasize the loneliness of the EOD techs and the rush they get. To me it's a cheap way to show something that could have been shown more accurately and , therefore, more realistically. I mean, I've never been in the military, but even I know that you don't send a three-man EOD out by themselves to wander around, or hold your squad in one place without any perimeter security.This exceeds the usual degree of make-believe in movies (e.g., having all the sprinkler heads in a building go off if you activate a single one)and reaches the level of bad cop shows, where investigators NEVER call for back-up or take uniformed officers along with them in dangerous situations.In short, definitely worth a look, but not award-worthy.",6,2,5,25 January 2010
Event Horizon," Don't you hate to see good money wasted?
","Well, actually, I hate to see bad money wasted, too, but you get my point. A lot of effort went into this film and it should have turned out better than it did. The SFX aren't too bad, and the sets look nice, but the primitive CGI is kind of obvious. The 'weightless' scenes are also pretty glaring. (Take the lead from the Alien quadrilogy...don't show weightlessness if you don't have to.) Unfortunately, there were a lot 'clang' moments in this movie. If a ship and its crew travel to a place of utter 'chaos,' how could they come back in the condition that they did? I mean, chaos is, by definition, disorganization. It takes an awful lot of organization, the opposite of chaos, to accomplish what the ship (or the evil entity, or whatever) did. And what trained crew member, no matter how he feels, is going to think, 'Oh, that must be my kid, who I know is actually 47 million miles away, running down the corridor of my sealed spaceship'? It's just hard to identify with the characters.Other than that, it's kind of OK. Anderson does a pretty poor job of editing and you end up confused about where you are at anytime, but I attribute this to his wanting to keep the viewer disoriented.Worth viewing, but it falls short of its potential.",5,0,1,12 May 2010
Paranormal Activity," Lots of 'clang' moments....
","This is a Blair Witch wannabe with way too many 'clang' moments. 'Clang' moments are when the film doesn't ring true, often because of very small details. But these moments can spoil a film just like a bad performance or script can.For PA, one of the 'clang' moments (actually, a steady stream of them) is that Katie wears a bra all through the movie. It's not that I want to see her braless, it's that I know that well-endowed women don't wear bras ALL the time. My mother is busty, my sister is busty, my first wife was busty, my girlfriend is busty, and I've dated a lot of other busty women. Contrary to what's shown in these 'home movies,' you'd have a hard time keeping a busty woman like Katie in a bra at all when she's at home. She certainly wouldn't be wearing one when she's asleep in bed, brushing her teeth right after arising in the morning, or making love. It's a small thing, I know, but this is supposed to be actual amateur footage and that's a key to the success of the movie.There are plenty of other similar problems. All in all, it's a good effort, but it does not match the subtlety or coyness of Blair Witch.",3,2,3,15 October 2010
Into the Wild," Beautifully photographed story about an empty life.
","If I were granting stars on the basis of the story of Chris McCandless and his 'personal journey,' I would only be giving this film one star (or less, if I could.) However, I have to admit that Penn did put together a good-looking movie, so I gave it a couple extra stars.On the flip-side of Penn's work, is...crap. (I'm going to assume that everyone knows the basics of the McCandless story and is at least aware of Krakauer's excellent book.) Penn has made some very poor decisions in his direction. The voice-over narration by Jena Malone as McCandless's sister is irritating and completely unnecessary. Penn's general attitude about the government, society, and the place of personal self-discovery is pushed in your face, all the more curious considering how much he owes his personal success to the people he is apparently angry with. (Just how many of the inevitably kind, honest, and friendly hippie-types/free-spirits in this film are likely to have invested in producing his films or even bothered buying tickets to see them?) I also have to make a leap of faith here and assume that Penn in some way admires, or at least empathizes with, McCandless's personal quest and is trying to show us that there is at least something that is worthwhile about it. If this is true, then Penn has really screwed up as a director, since McCandless is actually portrayed as a self-indulgent, narcissistic, ego-centered, foolish, and totally unpleasant young man. (I guess my theory is wrong if Penn actually INTENDED to depict McCandless in this way.) Overall, an average movie about a person who doesn't deserve one. (Read Krakauer's book, as it is much more rewarding and, in fact, more neutral in its tone.)",3,7,11,15 December 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The most fascinating thing about ESotSM is why people like it.
","I am sincerely curious as to why so many people seem to like this film. Does it awaken their own desire for 'endless and unquenchable' love? Have they tired of '12 Monkeys', 'Total Recall', 'The Butterfly Effect', and 'Irreversible'? Do they want to feel hip? Is there a Carrey/Winslett cult out there? Do people want to see their primal fears about exactly what medical personnel do when they are undergoing a procedure? But, let's get back to the movie itself and some of its major flaws.First, as many reviewers have pointed out, Carrey and Winslett simply have no chemistry. Zero. Nada. Zip. This lack of chemistry makes it very difficult for us to believe that Carrey would be so tenacious and, presumably, unique in fighting the memory manipulation. The fact that he does can only reflect the weakness of character and the dependence he has on others for any meaning in his life. Basically, he's one degree removed from being a stalker.Second, there is no plot. There is a cute concept - not original, but cute - around which a whole movie has been made. Compare this to 'The Sixth Sense', which was also a movie built around a single 'trick,' but which redeemed itself through the rich characterizations and growth of the main characters. ESotSM has none of this.Third, the ONE actual piece of plot involves a very silly deus ex machina the writer uses to get out of a clumsy situation. It is unbelievable, irrational, and unsatisfying. (I'm referring of course to the 'subplot' involving Dunst and Wood.) I find it quite insulting.Last, it is just plain boring. The acting is flat and the characters simply don't earn our sympathy enough for us to care what goes on in their 'dream or reality?' sequences. In 'Groundhog Day', most people actually come to care for the self-centered and boorish Bill Murray as he repeats that single day ad infinitum. You won't do that in this movie.In summary, this is a slightly classier version of a Harlequin romance: True Love is too strong to be denied, even using the strongest force (technology) available to us. Now that I think about it, Fabio would have been good in Carrey's role, since Carrey can't seem to master that look of longing he needs.* out of ****",Null,1,3,27 December 2004
The World's Fastest Indian," Couldn't finish it.
","I wanted so much to like this movie, but it just got to be too much to bear. 'Crazy but Sweet' Burt gets on your nerves after the first 10 minutes and it becomes a challenge to grit it through the hackneyed situations and corny dialogue.The gratuitous menagerie of 'California Flakes' that Burt encounters on his trip to the USA is also way over the top.The only reason this movie got any stars at all was that the motorcycle scenes are above average, though the manipulation of the film speed is pretty irritating.Sorry, but this turns out to be a big yawn.",2,10,40,16 June 2006
Super 8," 7.3 stars (as of this date)? Really?
","'Super-8' isn't an awful movie, and I will freely admit that the child actors do a much better job than most, but how could this be rated as high as it is? To me (and to use an old aphorism), there's no there there. This film doesn't really have anything to say, other than that the producer and director liked to make films when they were younger. This would have been a MUCH better film if it had omitted the SF/alien angle completely.As it stands, it is an uneasy melding of 'E.T.', 'Cloverfield', 'Stand By Me', and 'The Goonies.' Furthermore, it contributes nothing that we haven't already seen many times before. I know it's up to the producer to decide what the money gets spent on and which films get made, but this was a terrible miss by anybody's standards.Finally, I have to mention the CGI and FX, which are uniformly dull. This worked for Abrams in another film when the action took place in space, but the same thing doesn't work for Small-town, USA. The train crash, for example, is excruciatingly long and unrealistic, and the viewer begins to wince after the first five seconds or so because it is just so embarrassing. (As usual, I blame gamers for this, as they seem willing to accept the most mediocre CGI as long as it looks about what their games look like.) It's not thrilling and certainly not realistic.But I drone on. This is an adequate movie, but it's not a good one.",4,4,7,28 November 2011
National Treasure," Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.....
","I am not a 9-year-old, so this movie seems a 'bit dumb' to me.I was, however, quite amused by the statement of one character that, 'If it has secret writing, there will be a mark in the upper right-hand corner.' Guess I missed that rule when I attended the School on Secret Writing.This is simply an unbelievable and very insulting bit of trash. Avoid it. If you want a better Bruckheimer film, watch 'Ronin'.Harvey Keitel, I'm embarrassed for you.Nicholas Cage, have you, too, reached the nadir of your career?Oh, yeah, sensors (on the container for the DoI) that actually sense heat, motion, and cold don't GLOW! Spend some money and hire somebody that actually knows something and has an IQ of more than 80!!!This is a complete waste of money, both in the making and the viewing..",2,9,18,2 July 2005
The Happening," Why did Ebert like this as much as he did?
","'The Happening' is a sad and pathetic film. Throughout the movie, I was thinking, 'Does MKS really think the world and 'nature' are like this? Where did he go to school? Does he ever read actual, real books about science, physics, and subjects other than film?' Of course, it was easy for me to think these thoughts because the acting is totally and uniformly awful. There are NO good acting roles in this film and every single actor just tanks it. Wahlberg is terrible in a Snidely Whiplash fake way in the first scenes and just goes downhill. I've never understood Deschanel's appeal and she makes Wahlberg look like Gielgud. My only hope is that MKS really does understand how stupid the whole story is and was trying to create a grand metaphor for, for...something else, I guess. Can't imagine what. Don't waste your time on this, even if you just want to see how bad it is.",1,2,6,1 May 2009
Zombieland," THIS is what passes for a good movie nowadays?
","It is a sad comment on moviegoers in general if this piece of junk has done as well as the trade publications claim. I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this film, other than the fact that it had better production values than most indies. It's not that it's offensive. In fact, it's pretty darned bland. It's just a lot of nothing. (I gave it three stars simply for production values.)To start with, all four of the leads are unlikeable. (And Woody 'leads' the list.) I never gave a flip what happened to them.Add to that the total lack of originality in the script and shooting. Whole scenes were taken from other films (survival films, zombie films, vampire films, road trip films...take your pick) with predictable results. There's a total absence of originality, quirkiness, or any other aspect that might make this movie memorable.The movie does make a lame attempt to provide some 'guidelines' or rules for survival, but they are idiotic at best. Furthermore, the lead characters all commit egregious errors time and time again, placing themselves in those wacky comedic situations as their lives are once again endangered. ('Hey, dude, you were surprised once before. Don't you think you ought to be careful this time and look behind the hay bales?') Finally, I felt so sorry for Bill Murray. I really do hope that he got a great paycheck and that he can afford milk for the rest of the year.Oh, yeah...the CGI is about average for most video games. Are we EVER going to get back to practical FX in movies?Watching this movie lowered my opinion of many of my fellow moviegoers yet again. A lot of people in the theater (which means about 10 out of all 25 people) were laughing at the stale jokes and puns like they had never heard them before.",3,31,61,12 October 2009
The Wrestler," Sadly, a snoozer from Aronofsky.
","TW is not an awful film, but it's certainly not in the same league as Aronofsky's 'Pi', 'Requiem for A Dream', and 'The Fountain'. These films exhibited some style and originality, but TW just retreads 'Rocky' and half-a-dozen other films about washed-up athletes. All the mandatory clichés are there...estranged daughter, stripper with a heart of gold who has a rule about dating customers, unsuccessful attempts to hold a regular (non-wrestling) job, and so forth. It might as well have been titled 'Wrestler: The Rehash'.Again, unlike his previous films, Aronofsky does not demonstrate any real style in filming the story. It's workmanlike, and the editing is pretty good, but there's absolutely no pizazz to it.Some people will go to see this film thinking that it will give you insight into the world of professional wrestling. While it's true that you get to see a bit of what it's like backstage, you never get the feeling that you understand it that well. It's similar to walking through an auto factory and expecting to understand the auto business.Finally, we come to Rourke's performance. Now, I like Rourke as an actor as much as any guy. This is one reason that I squirm when I see what he has done to himself over the past 20 years. Fortunately (or unfortunately), the combination of substance abuse, face lifts, and botox does a pretty good job of preparing him to look like a washed-up wrestler who has abused his body beyond the point of endurance. As far as the actual acting, not so good. And Tomei is never convincing as the dancer who is his romantic interest, either.In conclusion, not an awful film, but not up to Aronofsky's other work.",4,4,9,20 July 2009
Inception," So, the 'tricky' is now 'deep'?!?
","I doubt anybody will read this review, since it's neither a 'fan rave' nor a 'hated it.' The movie gets four stars from me primarily because the CGI is not as bad as most other recent movies and Leo actually does some decent work. (Gordon-Levitt is also quite good, but he's canceled out by Ellen Page, who is, as usual, barely tolerable and not at all believable in her role.) Frankly, I just don't get the hype over 'Inception' as metaphor, and it sure doesn't impress me as being a truly deep or complex movie. It's more like the level of the well-known character explaining how our solar system could actually itself be an atom, with the sun as the nucleus, etc.Actually, I take that back...it IS a complex movie. Needlessly complex, I might add. The whole set of rules for entering into (and out of) someone's dreams are so ridiculously complex that they obviously exist only to set up the action sequences. Unfortunately, this makes it necessary for all the characters to explain them to each other throughout most of the movie. (Why is this? If they're professionals at doing this sort of thing, why do they all need to have it explained to them each time? That's like reminding a soldier how to take the safety off his weapon just before exiting the personnel carrier.) Furthermore, the dream world is not dream-like. It's more like the virtual world of 'Tron.' If I were shown the action sequences with no exposition, I'd guess that the characters were in a virtual world, or in another dimension, but not in a dream.Finally, in spite of some good performances, I didn't give a lickspittle about the characters. What they are doing (or attempting to do) is immoral and unethical. And what risks they face are basically virtual as well. Who gives a flip? There's no redemption, no character development, no introspection (at any substantive level), and what you're left with is a mixture of pop psychology and 'the solar system itself may just be an atom.' This may be a good film on some levels, but I didn't care for it.",4,12,21,27 July 2010
Signs," What an offensively shallow and stupid movie!!
","****Minor Spoilers!****Yes, I WISH that I could pretend that everything that occurred in this movie was actually the daughter's dream, but circumstances lead me to believe otherwise.I have seen movies that demonstrate a director's religious/philosophical beliefs, but I really hope that Shyamalan thinks at a slightly more profound level than this film suggests.This film is shallow, naive, theologically inconsistent, and stupid beyond belief.  The dialogue and action are completely ridiculous and unbelievable. There is no point in recapping what some other reviewers have said, so let's just say that I worry that there might actually be some people who believe this kind of junk and ACTUALLY VOTE IN ELECTIONS!!!There is no doubt in my mind about what this pretentious movie is saying, since it is completely unsubtle, but this film offers no arguments as to the validity or benefit of such beliefs.Fortunately, the director has couched his suggestions and statements in a genuine mess of a movie, with physical inconsistencies, gargantuan jumps in logic, and completely unbelievable characterizations.  This means that you simply can't take them seriously. In spite of that, I found this movie far more offensive than some slasher movies.  At least they make no pretense in their efforts to shock and titillate.  They have no ulterior motives.I think that you should see this movie just as an exercise in learning about other people's muddled thought processes.  In this respect, it evokes tremendous depression, so you will at least have SOME reaction to his work.",Null,4,6,11 May 2003
The Cabin in the Woods," I feel like the high ratings on this film have redeemed me.
","I've caught some crap from other reviewers and in the forums on this site because I like a certain two films: 'Thir13en Ghosts' (2001) and 'Darkness Falls' (2003). I gave each one a pretty decent rating. This has made me a BAD PERSON and a TERRIBLE REVIEWER.The high ratings that 'The Cabin In The Woods' has received so far make me feel much better about myself, since this is basically a pretty mediocre movie and lots of people think it's a great work of art. It's sort of interesting in parts, but you can only plug so many homages into a single film without it feeling like it's just patched together from other people's films. I can't think of a single original scene or plot point in the whole movie.I think what disappoints me the most is that TCITW tries to be lot more than it can be. The two other movies (see above) I mentioned are pretty small and compact films, with moderate budgets and limited aspirations. TCITW tries to be a lot more. One of the most disappointing things about TCITW is the lousy CGI. It opts for extended CGI sequences that would require a lot of work (and money) to get right. And the move doesn't get them right, or even believable. You feel like the director and producers are saying, 'Isn't this a great concept to have all these classic creatures in a single scene? Too bad we didn't have the budget to make it impressive on the screen, but the idea to do it was cool.'So, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch this. Just don't expect a very scary (or impressively different) film.BTW, I'm a massive Whedon fan.",5,2,6,25 September 2012
Contact," Good movie of a very bad book.
","To be fair, Sagan's 1997 book was astonishingly bad and this movie makes as much of it as one could. In later life, and perhaps under the influence of his wife, Sagan got...well, 'flaky' is the only word that I can think of. (To be fair, aging politicians and actors do exactly the same thing.) I used to console myself that perhaps the book, 'Contact', was simply one of Sagan's jokes. Perhaps, I thought, he set about writing a book which was the exact opposite of his own beliefs, especially those he discusses in 'The Demon-Haunted World'. Unfortunately, both the book and now the movie have persuaded me otherwise.What drives the characters in this move are some peculiar (and unsettling) types of motivation. For example, I, for one, can honestly say that I don't feel lonely and isolated from the universe because there aren't intelligent beings on other planets. In fact, I doubt very much that the knowledge of intelligent life existing elsewhere in the universe would help my loneliness (or any aspect of my life) one bit. I would find it interesting, but ultimately irrelevant to the meaning of life. Yes, this movie promises that one day there will be communications and travel between worlds that include Earth, but it also suggests that this won't happen until humankind is ready for it, which seems to be a bit after my life is likely to have ended.Sagan often wrote about claimed encounters with alien intelligent beings and was quick to point out that the aliens invariably delivered sermons on the need for peace, or reassurances about humankind's place in the universe. The 'little green men' never give a human an indisputable piece of physical evidence, or impart knowledge (such as the proof for a theorem that has puzzled mathematicians for centuries) that might actually persuade others that contact has actually been made. In 'Contact', Sagan does exactly what he preaches against. The protagonist 'meets' with a representative of a far-advanced culture/species and is told a bunch of New-age pablum that is intended only to make her feel good. 'One day, your species will be ready.' Makes me want to barf.Finally, this movie is like the proverbial river that is half-a-mile wide and one inch deep. The characters are always spouting off about the 'meaning of life' and conflicts between science and faith, but they have absolutely nothing to say about them and no new points of view to contribute. It's like using 'high-tech' talk in a science-fiction movie without there being any real scientific underpinnings. Sure, people DO search for meaning in their lives. But there are many types of meaning (purpose, significance, worth, etc.) and they are not interchangeable. The dialogue here just tosses about a bunch of nonsense phrases and expects shallow-thinkers to be impressed.Overall, a very frustrating movie (and book). Just think how much better this would have been if Sagan had been in his prime (and if his wife had stayed out of it.)",2,10,23,13 October 2008
Donnie Darko," Frustrating, yet oddly satisfying....
","Go to one of the many websites dedicated to the the DD 'mythos' if you want to know exactly how the TU came to be, or whether Frank is actually real when he acts as a 'messenger,' or why Donnie has to do what he does to set things right. But if you do, I think you're missing a great experience. This is definitely a Top 10 Movie of all time in my book, but I can easily understand how many viewers would not like it at all.Watch the film and form your own conclusions. It is very touching and personal on several different levels. (I'm a sucker for 'Mad World'...I cry every time I watch the montage at the end of the movie.)Once you've watched this movie, go back and listen to the director's commentary on the DVD, You may be quite surprised at what you learn.This is definitely a must-see film.***** out of *****2005 Update: After watching the new Director's Cut a couple times, I have to tell you that I have mixed feelings. The film does indeed flow better and is visually haunting, but I believe that, overall, the DC is for the worst. Here are a couple problems I have with it:1. The movie is now a little TOO accessible. The insertion of the passages from TPOTT are a bit much and are really pushed into the viewer's face. The additional scenes are also too high-tech, as if they are supposed to simulate God or DD's consciousness as a computer, video recorder, or radar screen.2. The additional scenes also slow the movie down quite a bit. It was compact and terse in the original version.3. Last, and most important, the viewer gets to see hints, information, and foreshadowing that are not accessible to Donnie. In the original version, the viewer gets to see only the basic information that is available to DD, so we empathize more with his confusion. In the Director's Cut, we are less empathetic and view DD more from an detached, more omniscient point of view.I STRONGLY recommend that you view the original version first and then, after some thought, go ahead and view the Director's Cut a few months later.",Null,0,0,4 November 2003
The Island," 'Underrated!'?!?
","Probably the least-subtle movie made in the last five years.Can't ANYBODY get the future right? We use push-plates on glass doors because it looks awful when you leave palm prints on glass. Voice-command for computers is impractical. The idea behind a mouse (and any other GUI that relies on hand motions) is to MINIMIZE the motion required, not maximize it. To disconnect a complex and expensive piece of equipment from a bio-organic assembly, you use bolt-cutters to cut the tubes??But enough of that. Bay is fascinated with blue eyes. EVERYONE has blue eyes. EVERY SINGLE close-up features blue eyes. Hey, Mike! The majority of people in the UK and US (judging the local of the movie by accents) have non-blue eyes. Therefore, the majority of people in this movie should have non-blue eyes. Unless it's income-based...which I guess it would be.Oh, yeah, and if you have any competition between a male and a female, have the female win, because, in spite of all the advances made on behalf of gender equality over the last 100 years, it's still shocking to have a female best a male. It's contrary to expectations, right? Boy, Mike, you sure are some master of building tension!! I used to subscribe to the Scholastic Book Service when I was in the 4th grade. Some of the books were great and others were too simple even for a 4th-grader. This movie is too simple even for the SBS.In summary, a stupid and pointless movie...much like this review.
