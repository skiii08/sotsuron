Deepwater Horizon," Too much technical stuff and good vs bad prevents it from being a perfect emotional ride
","Yesterday it was time for a visit to the cinema, it's been a while. The film I saw was Deepwater Horizon, the story of the oil platform that started leaking in 2010 and caused one of the biggest oil disasters in modern time. In the film we get to follow Mike Williams, played by Mark Wahlberg. He is an electronics technician onboard the platform and leaves his daughter and wife (Kate Hudson) to go and work for 21 days. Kurt Russell is also in the film playing the manager of the platform and the top ranking employee. After what they first believed would be three normal work weeks, things take a turn of events when the platform explodes from the oil pressure.At first I could not understand what kind of film Deepwater Horizon wanted to be. Many family emotions, friendships and relationships at the beginning and after that a very technical part begins. About 20 – 30 minutes of the film is about technical aspects of oil drilling which frankly I think goes straight by most of us. Sure It's a little exciting when they are talking about oil pressure and performs test whether to start drilling or not. BUT, the problem is that we already know that everything will go to hell. Therefore I think that when they are building drama and tension on things that really should be standard procedures onboard an oil platform, it gets a little cheap. I'm convinced that had we not known the outcome of the film, these scenes would feel strange and over exaggerated. To but it simply, they are building drama on pure trifles just because we already know the outcome. Clever and viable, but still cheap and boring.I think it's a shame how black and white Deepwater Horizon is. It's crystal clear who's good and bad. Despite everyone being soaked in oil and mud, BP's logo is still clearly visible on the 'villains' helmet. Somewhere here they touch a very sensitive subject without ever really developing it more. Who's fault was it really? Political and environmental impact? The reactions of the world? None of this is included in the film. Now I've arrived at the things that I actually think the film does really well and what could have made it even better, had it been even more focused. Somewhere in the middle of Deepwater Horizon I realized what kind of film this is and should be. A strong emotional drama. We get to know these people and their families. We follow them onboard the platform and gets affected in the same way they do. We suffer, feel their pain, their loss and eventually at the end we also also get emotional scars. This is the real strong points of the film. To take us on an emotional journey that plays out our whole register, from laughter to crying. Skip the politics, the parts too difficult to understand and the good vs bad. Show us, don't tell us. Finally I want to say that the sound in Deepwater Horizon was also one of the things that impressed me the most. So good and strong sound quality that the speakers in the theater barely could play it. Thumbs up for that.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,2,5,12 October 2016
Zootopia," An animated animal film about today's social and racial issues that hits the right spots
","Imagine a world like the one we people live in, only we are all animals. And not just some animals, all animals together. Zootopia is one of Disney's films from this year and it has really become an international success. In this world of animals, a lot of them grow up into already decided places and positions. If you are a bunny, you should become a carrot farmer. Judy Hopps is exactly that kind of bunny, born and raised outside of the city of Zootopia. She decides at an early age to become something more. After graduating from the police academy as the first bunny ever to do so, she moves to the big city. She soon discovers that it is a long way to the top and not everyone in the animal world is getting along as well as she thought. She is quickly drawn into kidnappings that go higher up than anyone in Zootopia could have imagined. Great voice actors lent their voices for the film, such as Jason Bateman, Idris Elba and Ginnifer Goodwin.Firstly I got to say that I was positively surprised. Partly due to the fact that the film was awesome, but also because it really wasn't at all what I expected. Sure it is a family film but forget the standard family film formula. We are talking Swedish Beck and Wallander combined with American police films. Sometimes the film is actually scary and exciting, but most of all it is well thought out. We follow mostly Hopps and and Nick Wilde the fox, as they struggle to discover who or what's behind the mysterious kidnappings. We are even offered some plot twists and just when you thought we were getting close to the end, the film takes another turn and becomes something else. Very strong and bravely done by Disney.Zootopia's strongest points lies in the relationship between the animals. It is a 'the small person against the big' film. Hopps is a small herbivore among predators that for a long time ago used to eat animals like her. Anti-racial messages and tolerance is clearly visible in the film. It does not try and hide the fact that we may all look different and have various preferences, but we are all equal and deserving of a chance in life. When you sometimes think that the film will end, the filmmakers does not hesitate to twist it one more time and deliver another punch to our heads about moral and value. Zootopia could be Disney's most political and strongest equality praising film to date. It will certainly remain for a long time in my memory because it dares to ask us these difficult questions and also to venture outside of the frames of the family film genre and sometimes become almost a thriller. Very high level of surprise and entertaining for a family film. Disney Animation Studio's best animated film in yearsDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",7,0,4,13 July 2016
The Danish Girl," A beautiful portrayal of a transgender man and his wife
","The successful British director Tom Hooper, who made big films like The King's Speech and Les Misérables, here takes on the true story about one of the world's first sex changes. Eddie Redmayne plays Einar Wegener who changes his sex and becomes the woman Lili Elbe. Alicia Vikander plays Einar's wife Gerde. They both deliver fantastic Oscar nominated performances. The Danish Girl is an important film not only about a sex change, but also LGBT rights and above all transsexual people's right to a life of their own choosing.The main focus of the film is actually not directly on Einar/Lili, and we as an audience sees most of it all through the eyes of the wife Gerda. I am a bit divided in my opinion about this because it makes us a spectator, but when the main plot focuses on Einar/Lili and we follow it through Gerde's eyes, we still barely get to know her. She functions mainly as support to Einar/Lili. It would have been interesting to make the film entirely from the perspective of Einar/Lili. Make us the audience become her, feel and understand how she feels. Gerda could have been a supporting character on the side. This also becomes more clear with the fact that Redmayne, nominated for the leading role has less screen time than Vikander who is nominated for a supporting role.I think The Danish Girl is a good film you must see. It does take certain liberties with the story, compared to the truth, but most likely to make it more exciting on film. This does not bother me because the film's message is more important than an exact truthful story. I do however think it would have been better if we were to follow the film more from the perspective of Einar/Lili than Gerde. Make us really enter her head, make us understand how she feels. Otherwise, the film is incredibly beautiful to watch. The costumes, the production design and the cinematography is extraordinary, plus beautiful music by Alexandre Desplat. I am hoping for a Swedish Oscar on Sunday.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,1,2,7 April 2016
Creed," Stallone's comeback as an aging mentor
","Rocky Balboa is back and this time as old as the hills and the owner of a restaurant in Philadelphia. Rocky's opponent Creed is long gone but his illegitimate child Adonis Creed lives. He decides to become a boxer like his father and looks up Rocky in Philadelphia and asks him to become his personal trainer. Creed is the first time Rocky is back on the big screen since 2006 and makes it the seventh film in the series.Boxing movies is often very much the same when it comes to the story and I personally think it needs something else besides the boxing to really raise these films above normal. Like a dramatic problem behind the sport. Creed succeeds in doing this. We really feel for the son of Creed and understand why he does what he does, because the main focus is the drama behind the sport. In the end it doesn't really matter whether he wins or not because the personal revenge is more important than the sport itself. The decision not to let Rocky box but become a trainer, is good and should perhaps have been made in the last film 10 years ago. Sylvester Stallone has probably not portrayed Rocky this good since the first film in 1976.Judging from the length of Creed, it certainly follows today's trend in length with its 2 hours and 13 minutes that actually makes it the longest Rocky film to date. Despite its length, the story goes on and is fairly exciting all the way through. It is a classic setup that still works, mostly because they polished and remade Stallone's Rocky into an aging mentor. I think that is the main reason why this film works so well. It is a personal revenge for the film series and also for Stallone who actually won a Golden Globe and received an Oscar nomination for his role.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,0,0,7 April 2016
Spotlight," A true story about the importance of free journalism
","Spotlight is the true story about how the newspaper Boston Globe revealed child molestation within the Catholic Church and how they tried to cover it up. As a student of journalism, I find this film to be particularly interesting, especially the investigative journalism. I mentioned Spotlight in a post last summer and said that I thought it could be Oscar material. Spotlight did win two Oscars on this years show, best screenplay and best picture. Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams does a fantastic job with great acting.Spotlight never leaves anything for chance. It is a well played drama and as the journalists digs up new clues, the film itself always moves one step closer to the truth. Even if we already know how it will end and just how bad it actually was, I still get pulled into the excitement. Films like Spotlight has a dramaturgy with a constant forward motion and rewards for the audience in form of small clues we gradually figure out. These films seldom feel boring and the same goes for Spotlight.The relatively unknown director Tom McCarthy has in Spotlight found a good balance between unwrapping the story with dialogue and by telling it in images. There's a lot of intense talkative conversations but they break away from them with longer montages of home visits and investigative journalism. Spotlight is definitely one of 2015's best films and a must see. I grade it a four.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",8,1,2,8 April 2016
The Hateful Eight," One of Tarantino's weaker films, but still not bad
","A lot of people were excited about Quentin Tarantino's new film The Hateful Eight. There's been a lot of gossip around this film, partly due to the script leaking online. Tarantino was furious and made threats about not making the film at all. Considering his two latest films, Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds' tendencies to violence and blood, I knew what to expect. With a great star cast with names like, Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth and Bruce Dern, I expected good acting.The Hateful Eight is an interesting western with elements of an Agatha Christie crime drama. A lot of different characters together in one small space makes for an exciting ending. I was genuinely interested at first to see how Tarantino would tie it all together. But, something happened about halfway through the film. Tarantino changed tracks and started pulling the film away in different directions. A bad narrative voice, long scenes of the past explaining things we already knew and strange character focus, took up too much space. It feels as if Tarantino has lost what ones made him so great to begin with in films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The ability to trust his audience and not proclaim us dumb by over clarify things and messages.The Tarantino I got to know as a young cineaste, made films like Pulp Fiction and completely blew my mind. Where is he now? Ever since the Kill Bill films, it feels like he is more interested in violence, blood and subtle one-liners. Still, the thing that Tarantino really did good in The Hateful Eight is the craft of the film itself. The original music by the legendary Ennio Morricone is brilliant and the incredibly beautiful cinematography, especially the snowy climate at the beginning of the film is breathtaking. Also, the acting didn't disappoint. As a whole The Hateful Eight is an OK film but I can't help feel that it could have been much better if Tarantino just would have trusted us as he ones did.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",5,14,31,7 April 2016
American Sniper," A war movie through the eyes of a sharpshooter
","American Sniper is an American war film directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the self-biography about the sharpshooter Chris Kyle. Chris is American who dreams of becoming a cowboy but after the events of 11 September, he decides to join the Navy Seals. Throughout the film we follow him on his trips to Iraq to fight against the terrorists, and we also see him during his trips home to the USA in between.American Sniper feels very American and patriotic. The film has more or less divided USA in two sections, while some praise the film for its portrayal of the American soldiers' heroic efforts, others feels it hails and embellish a devastating war. I feel there is some truth to both sides because on one hand it shows the brutality of the terrorists ways, even against their own population, but it also shows the American soldiers breaking in to homes of innocent people and using force and violence to get their way.Clint Eastwood has done well with the direction because we truly experience the soldiers' fear of never knowing who to trust, whether it's grown man or a small child. The war scenes are well made and they don't feel shaky or edited too fast just to force a feeling of action. Bradley Cooper does a really good job, probably the best I've seen of him so far, but I still wish we could have gotten to know his character even more. He's obviously a patriotic American but what really motivates him besides the love for his country, is sometimes hard to understand.Overall, I feel the film is OK and worth watching because it actually shows the brutality that was the war in Iraq, but I still can't help feeling that sometimes it seems Clint Eastwood had to bow down a little too much before Kyles' family. It appears they couldn't include some scenes just because his family didn't approve. As a story American Sniper doesn't feel unique or contributing in some new way for us, the audience, but I still feel you can watch the film and make up your own mind.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,1,11,7 April 2016
The Revenant," Man vs wild and beauty vs cruelness
","The director Alejandro González Iñárritu is back with The Revenant. After the success of Birdman, he returns with the real life story about the frontiersman Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Glass is left for dead in the wild and is forced to fight for his survival and at the same time he swears revenge on those who left him for dead. The Revenant is a renowned film, partly due to the difficulties during the making of it, but also because many feels it is finally time for DiCaprio to get his well deserved Oscar.The Revenant is incredibly beautiful, shot with only natural light. The film crew practiced the takes during the day, and shot them later when the light was perfect with only a few hours to spare. Iñárritu's demanding style and the different weather conditions, caused according to the rumors, many to leave the film. Perhaps understandable but nevertheless the result is stunning. Iñárritu's long takes and tracking camera movements are consistent. He rather shows us the action with brutal realism, than enforce it with fast cutting. Brutal realism really is the right word for The Revenant. Our eyes are not spared of anything, even if a hand gets cut in half or a person shot through the stomach. It really feels as though we are right in the middle of the film, rather than an audience watching from a platform.The Revenant is to me a man vs wild film. Other films, such as Deliverence, Aguirre, the Wrath of God and Into the Wild comes to mind. Terrence Malick's nature influences are visible. At the same time as the film is incredibly beautiful, it is also extremely brutal. In one scene we watch enchanting landscape and northern lights, but in the next we also see how cruel nature can be. Next to DiCaprio, Tom Hardy plays an Oscar nominated supporting role as the bad John Fitzgerald. The Revenant is really worth your time and truly something out of the ordinary. Prepare yourselves for a dramatic movie about how man and natures, cruel and beautiful paths cross. I grade it an 8.",8,1,2,23 March 2016
Bridge of Spies," A somewhat exciting but rather bland story of Americans helping each other
","Bridge of Spies is about a simple American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, who during the 60's Cold War defends a Soviet spy, played by Mark Rylance. Hanks eventually end up in the middle of East Berlin to negotiate a trade, the Soviet spy for an American pilot. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg which means that the two heavyweights are reunited once again, the last time being in 2004 when they collaborated on The Terminal. Bridge of Spies was nominated for an Oscar, among others in the category for best picture. Mark Rylance won surprisingly for best supporting role.Bridge of Spies is a very skillfully crafted film but with such a competent director as Steven Spielberg, I wasn't expecting anything else. What really stands out with Bridge of Spies is how great they've recreated East Berlin in the 60's. The production design, the costumes and the music is indeed top class. I was curious about the story itself, but at the same time I sort of suspected it to be a pretty one-sided tale of American heroism. I was right.The fact that Bridge of Spies is told from an American perspective is not a problem, there are tons of great films told that way. The thing that bothers me is the liberties they take with the truth, just for dramatic effect. Everything can of course not be true in a film based on real events, but this film steps over the line a couple of times. An example of this is the portrayal of how the Soviet treats their prisoners just to make them look worse. The other thing that bothers me is the pacing of the film and the fact that it never really takes off. It's sort of like watching a motion picture combined with a documentary where they twist and turn the truth. Hanks spends a lot of time in East Berlin without ever really finding out anything new and vital. With its 2 hours and 20 minutes, Bridge of Spies is simply too long and could have been made on or below 2 hours. The story is however interesting and the film looks good, 6 out of 10.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,0,1,8 April 2016
Captain America: Civil War," One of the most epic superhero movies ever made
","Yesterday it was premiere and time for the second big superhero film this year, Captain America Civil War. I really like Captain America as a superhero, mostly due to his lack of over powerful strength. He is a soldier who during WWII, was subjected to experiments intended to make him a super soldier. The result was superhuman powers but nowhere near the likes of Superman or the Hulk. Frozen down and later awaken in present day earth, he struggles to adapt in modern society where everyone he has known or loved, is gone. In Civil War he is pinned against Iron Man. The government of the USA, forces the Avengers to sign a contract stating that they have to obey and work under supervision of the leaders of the world. Iron Man is convinced that it is the right thing to do while Captain claims that they will be forced to do things they don't want to.I really liked Captain America Civil War and I would say that it is one of Marvel's and overall among the best superhero films ever made. Forget Superman's or the Avenger films' extremely over powerful enemies that practically can erase the earth with a wind blow. Here it is brains before muscles and I like it. The film practically has more in common with James Bond and the Mission Impossible films, than with other superhero films. The spy theme is pretty constant throughout the film, with for example a hunt for a terrorist through several countries. There is also focus on terror acts which feels both modern and disturbing considering today's world situation. The other thing that the film does really well is balancing the characters. Civil War contains a lot of superheroes and it is at times hard to keep track on everyone. But with finesse and a prioritized focus, they choose which ones will run the story and which ones will figure as background characters. Very smart and thought-out. With most focus on Captain America and then Iron Man, they succeed much better than the previous Avenger films and most of all the latest Batman V Superman.The biggest question we all had before the film was, how will they put Captain America against Iron Man? Where Batman V Superman totally failed to motivate why those two giants would even fight each other, here they succeeded better from an even more difficult position because Captain America and Iron Man are friends that becomes enemies due to ideological and psychological differences. Overall the characters' actions are really well motivated. They have worked hard on giving every character a believable back story that drives them forward. Aside from the main conflicts and the superheroes, it is an incredibly well made film. The battle between the superheroes is so good looking and well choreographed that I can't think of an equal. Also the tempo and editing of the film works well towards it pretty long but still good runtime. The film constantly moves closer to the truth with small surprise moments and turning points along the way. It is perhaps necessary to have watched some of the other Marvel films before this one, but I still think that this works well on its own and that you should definitely take the chance to watch it in the cinemas because it is really exciting, good looking and well madeDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",8,28,56,28 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," An engaging beginning, but a bit unfocused on story and characters to deserve a higher rating
","Time for the awaited prequel to the Harry Potter films, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The film is set in the 20's, long before Harry Potter's time. It's about the young Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, who arrives in New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures. Unfortunately some of them escapes and he is force to go and look for them together with the muggle (non-magic people) Jacob Kowalski and the witch, Porpentina Goldstein, before they wreak havoc all over the city. The film is the first in the Harry Potter universe that isn't based on a book but an encyclopedia of magical creatures. J.K Rowling has written the script and also decided to keep the long and complicated title, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Seriously, couldn't they have thought of something better?At first we are greeted with a lot of news articles before ending up with Newt Scamander as he passes through the gates to New York. Honestly, the film has a slow beginning. A lot of the Harry Potter films begin quite dramatically with an evil dementor, a difficult house elf or a quidditch tournament. Here it takes a while before I'm starting to feel that the film really takes a hold of me. It also makes me wonder what's it really about? Newt is chasing his animals with the company of a muggle and a witch but at the same time we also find out that the American wizard world is quite different from the English one. Apparently there is some sort of interesting cultural conflict that we never really get the answer to. Pity!After a few fat jokes, a strange mating dance and a long almost completely animated scene in a suitcase, it actually starts to happen something. The evil in the film appears more and you start to understand the conflict. Unfortunately I don't feel that this evilness or the conflict is motivated or developed enough. It lacks a clear vision and a path already from the beginning. What does Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them really want to say? Whose story is it? Newt Scamander's, the muggle who wants to bake, the USA vs England conflict or the American ministry's fear of being exposed and start a war? Also in all this, add John Voight as a political leader with a son who likes to bully boys. Very strange.Behind all these questions and strange things, there are actually a lot of things to enjoy. The director David Yates continues in the same style as before, however with much more animation. It is charming to see the American wizard society and the 20's New York look good. Also the acting raises the film with Ezra Miller as a strange boy and Colin Farrell as an evil ministry man. All in all, an okay beginning of a new series, but what the next films will be about and what characters will fit in, especially considering that it is said to be set in Europe and eventually include Dumbledore, I really can't say. As I said, an okay beginning but it could definitely have been better.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,5,19,16 November 2016
It Follows," Scary in a Blair Witch Project/Halloween kind of way
","A lonesome girl sitting in a classroom, looks outside on the schoolyard. A moving white shape can be seen far away. The girl doesn't at first notice anything odd about it, but after a while it's clear that the shape is a human being heading straight towards her. In panic, she grabs her things and quickly leaves the classroom.It Follows is written and directed by the relatively unknown David Robert Mitchell. It's about the girl Jay, who after a sexual encounter with a guy, 'gets infected' by some sort of curse that starts to constantly follow her. It Follows is a low budget film made with only 2 million dollars, a small sum in today's measurements. Interestingly though, Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project were made with only about 20 000 dollars. Money isn't everything in the world of horror films.In the beginning of It Follows we follow the story mostly from a distant. The camera never really gets close and we feel more like a spectator, not really involved in the story. Later in the film we get drawn deeper in and our spectator role changes to a subjective perspective. Joy's perspective. This enhances the effect of the curse that's following her. In the beginning we were one in the crowd, watching, but later we turn into the one looking for the stalker in the crowd. The music in It Follows is very electronic and feels like a mix of David Lynch's companion Angelo Badalamenti and Giorgio Moroder. It really enhances the creepy feeling that lies like a cloth throughout the film.It Follows leaves me both impressed and disappointed at the same time. It's well crafted and the for me totally unknown cast does its job acting like typical teenagers in a horror flick. But, I still think the film falters a bit in the middle, and then even more towards the end. Once the story is laid out for us, it's like the film gets stuck. Where should we go next? This in turn seems to lead to more classic horror film clichés being used, which is a pity because the film started rather unconventionally. The ending does save the film, and without saying too much I do like it when a film leaves room for interpretations and personal thinking.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,4,7,28 March 2016
Room," Claustrophobic, scary and brilliant
","Room is the incredible story about Ma, played by Brie Larson, who at 17 years of age, gets abducted and imprisoned in a shed at her perpetrator's house. Now 7 years later, she has the 5 year old boy Jack, played by Jacob Trembley, who lives with her inside the shed. She does everything in her power to make him feel safe. The Irishman Lenny Abrahamson directed this hard and claustrophobic film. The first impression of Room is that the film is rather comfortable. Ma and Jack enjoy each others company and do things that a mother and son usually does. They bake, eat food, celebrate birthdays and watch TV together. After a while as we get more into the story, their relationship changes and becomes more and more tumultuous. Jack by the age of 5, is forced to face and take action against things that no human being ever should have to.Room is really divided in two parts, the first one in captivity and the second one in freedom. The interesting thing that Abrahamson does with this film, is that he in an incredible way asks very daring questions to us. With a life in total captivity, is it possible to feel freedom afterwards? When the safe base a 5 year old has felt his entire life just disappears, what happens then? How does the public react when something like this gets out in the open? Some parts really reminded me of the film Gone Girl where we see in the same way, how the media exploits the suffering the family is going through, only for their own self gain. These moral and psychological questions is the foundation of Room.The best thing about Room is these questions Abrahamson stirs up by not prevaricate, embellish or avoid delicate subjects. He shows it just like it is, no matter how brutal. The second thing that really enhances this film is the amazing acting by both Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley. Their chemistry is truly amazing and Larson even won an Oscar for her performance. If their relationship hadn't felt real, the film wouldn't at all work in the way it did. Room is perhaps one of 2015's most provocative and thought-provoking filmsDavid Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",8,1,3,28 March 2016
Selma," A story that could have been better with more focus on Martin Luther King Jr.
","The year is 1965 and every citizen in the USA still don't have voting rights. In the small community of Selma in Alabama, a woman tries to use her rights as a citizen to go and vote. She is unable to do so because according to the government of Selma, she doesn't have the right skin color. The political activist Martin Luther King Jr. hears about this and decides to do something. Selma is about the march that King initiated for voting rights for all African American people in the USA.David Oyelowo plays the lead role as Martin Luther King Jr. and the supporting cast includes Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Common, Carmen Ejogo and Oprah Winfrey. Selma has been the topic of debates all over the USA, due to its political context, its historical view but also because it was overlooked at the Oscars. David Oyelowo does an astonishing job in portraying the political leader and I do think it is a pity he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Carmen Ejogo also did a great job portraying King's wife and was in my opinion also worthy of a nomination.Selma is very moving in many ways and also quite horrible from a human perspective. At one point or another, brutal scenes are mixed with a happy home environment, perhaps to say that there is happiness and hope even in all this madness. I think the weak spot of the film is the lack of focus. We get a glimpse of King's private life and the hardship he and his wife endured, but at the same time the film shows the political and the historical context of it all involving the governor, the local sheriff and the president. In the middle of it all we have the Selma march.The film has also been questioned from a historical point of view because some critics feels that the portrayal of president Lyndon B. Johnson, isn't entirely correct. Personally I would have liked to see more from King's private life, and a deeper character development. I think a film more focused on the psychological aspect and not the political, would have made a greater impact.Selma is still worth seeing for what the march actually did for the USA as a nation. It is always important to look back and see where we have been, before we look forward to see where we are going. The film is an important life lesson for all of us, but I think it would have been more effective if it were a more personal film. The debates around Selma have mainly been focused on its historical context instead of actually discussing human rights, and I think that's shame.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,0,0,7 April 2016
Sicario," To fight evil we have to become evil
","Sicario is about the war against drugs and the drug cartels in Mexico. The FBI agent (Emily Blunt) gets hired by the CIA for a secret mission to bring down a drug lord. She will together with a special force working directly under CIA's special departments, cross the border into Mexico and bring back a powerful ally to a drug lord. Joshn Brolin plays a supporting character as a cocky CIA leader and Benicio Del Toro plays a mysterious hit-man whose participation for a long time remains a mystery. Sicario is raw and contains a brutal realism that really reflects the reality it is supposed to represent.The film starts immediately and Kate who works for the FBI, stumbles across a huge find that takes her to the CIA's special departments. Soon she works under strict secrecy and is forced to question her own morale values. It is here that Sicario starts to get really interesting. Everybody in the CIA has a pretty relaxed and cocky tone, despite the serious and sometimes brutal things they actually experience. I get the same thoughts and feeling as I got when I watched humans being tortured by relatively normal and not particularly affected people in the film Zero Dark Thirty. How far are we willing to go to defeat this evil, and can we come out of this with our ideals and values intact?Sicario goes on i a decent tempo with only a few slow parts here and there. There is an incredibly exciting car scene about halfway through the film that contains a lot of action, but besides that aren't there really that many action scenes. It is rather the politics and the questions of how to fight this brutal criminality, that are central for the film. Sicario is definitely a film worth watching for the problems and thoughts it takes up. The plot sort of twists itself by the end and I feel content afterward. All in all a solid film, a strong 6 out of 10.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,0,1,14 April 2016
The Witch," A brilliant terrifying horror film that'll chill you to the bone
","Really great horror films doesn't come around too often. I read a little about The Witch for about a year ago and was immediately interested in the story. It seemed so simple and disturbing, a British family in the 17th century that has traveled to America in hope of finding happiness and success. Not agreeing with the local church, they leave the village they've been living in, to move out to the country and build their own house. Once they are settled in, strange things begin to happen and it seems that someone in the family is more than a human being. Relatively unknown actors and a feature film debut for director Robert Eggers.Witches on film have been portrayed before, like The Blair Witch Project. It is something disturbing and brutal about witches, especially if you think about our own history here in Sweden where we for a long time burned women believed to be witches. The Witch is a drama horror film that doesn't rush its introduction. A lot of the story is created from the mood and the music. Instead of telling the story and explaining things through dialogue, Eggers lets the music and the cinematography speak for themselves. Sometimes the camera sweeps around the forest with creepy music playing in the background. Also religion plays a big part in the film. God and the belief in him, is always there and gets even worse when the family thinks they've been cursed. To make it even more realistic and believable, the dialogue is written in old English taken directly from old real writings from the same time. That is if we are to believe the credits.Witches on film have been portrayed before, like The Blair Witch Project.

Steve Jobs," The half told story of a genius
","It's time again for a biography and another film about the IT- entrepreneur Steve Jobs, who passed away just a few years ago. He was portrayed on film in 2013 by Ashton Kutcher in Jobs, but now the famous screenwriter Aaron Sorkin picked up the story again and wrote a new script. Danny Boyle directed it and Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet stars as lead and supporting role. Steve Jobs is not really about the entrepreneurs' whole life, but divided in only three parts. Each part is about the game behind the curtains prior to different product releases. We follow him in these three moments through two decades, just the half hour before he steps up onto the stage.Aaron Sorkin is known for writing very talkative scripts, like The Social Network or Moneyball. Steve Jobs is no exception. Fassbender fights and argues with Winslet, his family, his employees and his bosses. Every episode is suppose to represent and portray Jobs through different stages in his life, his distance to his family, his employees and his conflicts with the company Apple itself. Here is where the true strength of the film lies. There is much to take away from the dialogues and we can tell a lot just by listening and of course enjoying first rate acting.Steve Jobs still becomes a bit boring. After you've understood the episode parts and how the story is told mostly through dialogue and not images, nothing more really happens. Steve Jobs is in the film and was probably in real life, a very difficult man to understand. I don't really feel like I know more about him than I did before watching the film. His problematic character and the constant driving forces are there but what really motivates him. There are a few parts that explains this, like his childhood, adoption and so on, but I still think that more scenes from several years of his life, would have been more interesting. Steve Jobs is still a smart film and I like the idea, bit to get more than three out of five, something else would have been needed.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,0,0,8 April 2016
"Hail, Caesar!"," Communism or capitalism?
","The Coen brothers, the directors responsible for films such as The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Fargo. In their latest film Hail, Caesar! we follow a movie producer played by Josh Brolin, who during the 50's struggle to make films and at the same time handle difficult actors, directors and journalists. The film has a comical attitude much like their earlier film Burn After Reading, which I didn't really like. My expectations before watching this film, was that the brothers would find their way back to the fantastic comical timing they had in The Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Unfortunately they didn't succeed in doing so.Films about old Hollywood and its filmmaking are interesting and funny because they usually contain a lot of hilarious tributes to people in the industry. Here the Coen brothers makes parody on the likes of Charlton Heston, Gene Kelly and the successful director Vincente Minnelli. Hail, Caesar! fires wildly in all directions. Angry journalist threats, unwanted pregnancies and the constant communist menace. The problem with this is that I don't really know in which direction the Coen brothers wants to go, or what they really want to say. Communism versus capitalism and that not everything is black and white? I guess you should also see it as a sort of parody on Hollywood's paranoia towards communists during the 60's and 60's.Hail, Caesar! is a fun film. The production design and construction of Hollywood in the 50's is very nicely done. It also takes another turn when George Clooney's character in the film is shooting a picture of the old Roman Empire and also draws parallels to communism. I do however doubt if the Coen siblings really meant for it all to blend together in the diffuse way it did. I wonder if they actually had a more clear plan from the beginning. It probably would have raised my grade for the film if its focus and direction were better. However, I still think it is an interesting and funny picture and therefore I still grade it a six.",5,0,1,22 March 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," The Toy Story of animals
","The Secret Life of Pets is about pets and their world. Just like in Toy Story, the animals can speak and have a life of their own when the humans aren't looking or are away at work. The dog Max is living a quiet life with his owner Katie. One day she gets a bigger dog called Duke and immediately they start to fight to win her love. After having argued and fought out on a walk, Max and Duke gets lost in the underworld and meets other animals that don't live a fancy pet life like they do.The Secret life of Pets is a film like many other animal films and yet it succeeds in entertaining in a charming way by taking us on an adventure where we get to see life from their side. Films like Oliver & Company, Babe and Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey, comes to mind. Animal films are far from new and often contain a worn out story but despite this The Secret Life of Pets really delivers. I think one of the films central elements is the balance in the humor. There is clarity in the dialogue that is easy for children to understand, but there is also another dimension clearly meant for adults. This is often the thing that family films are having difficulties with, to be appealing for both children and adults. The latest Ice Age film that I reviewed here did not succeed in this. The other thing that I really think is the key to the success of this film is the tempo. With its one hour and 27 minutes, the film is not really that long but the time is well disposed and few scenes contains unnecessary things. It also makes us the audience wanting to see more of these animals when the film is over. I am not so sure that we would want that, had the film been 20 minutes longer and slower.The characters in the film is well thought out and shaped to fit this kind of road movie where someone travels forward. They usually include some sort of leader, someone who is a little stupid, someone who is a bit dangerous and also someone who is cocky and perhaps too brave. The Secret Life of Pets has all of these characters and also a villain, a white bunny. Perhaps a hint to Monty Python's evil bunny in the The Holy Grail and also ironic because a bunny is usually seen as cute and harmless. Quite fun, much due to Kevin Hart's great voice acting. The film summarizes itself well towards the end with several morale plot parts. Don't judge people (in this case animals) based on their appearance, comradeship, the ability to share and also that certain things that you want are often found right in front of you if you just look close enough. Definitely good messages for a family film, very often already told, but if delivered properly and in a new way like here in The Secret Life of Pets, they are worth telling several times over again.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,1,1,5 October 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An inventive portrayal of a fallen hero
","Birdman, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu and with Michael Keaton in the lead role. The film is about washed-up actor Riggan, who earlier played the famous superhero Birdman. In an attempt to revive his declining career, Riggan puts up his own Broadway play but at the same time battles family issues and personal psychological problems.Birdman is an incredibly well made film and really pulls you into the story from the start. It is shot to be experienced as one long take, which means that the camera sweeps around in the theater, creating a claustrophobic and stressful feeling. We follow the characters as they venture up on stage, behind the scene and in to their personal dressing rooms. To further expand the stressful feeling, Birdman's film score only contains percussions.In supporting roles we see Naomi Watts and Edward Norton as fellow actors in Riggan's play, but also Emma Stone as his daughter and Zach Galifianakis as his agent. Several of the actors, including Michael Keaton, have said that making the film was one of the hardest things they have done so far. Alejandro also stated that a lot of people around him thought the idea was crazy and would be extremely difficult to finish.The funny thing about Birdman is the subtle hints to reality. Michael Keaton himself is an actor who previously played the superhero Batman on screen, and the film includes small references to this. Edward Norton has a reputation for being difficult, which they also more or less joke about.Birdman was awarded an Oscar for best picture, cinematography, screenplay and director. Especially cinematography and the direction are clearly working together to create the style of the film. Each scene probably had to be planned to the smallest detail, for it to be able to work. I can speak about Birdman for ages, but I don't want to spoil too much and also to really understand what I mean, you should watch it and experience it yourselves.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",8,0,1,7 April 2016
The Big Short," Should have been made as a mockumentary
","The Big Short is based on a true story of how investors predicted the financial crisis of 2007, and earned money on betting that it would actually happen. The film is based on a fact book with the same name. The film includes big names such as Brad Pitt, Steve Carrell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling. It was nominated for several Oscars including best picture, and it did win for best adapted screenplay. Director Adam McKay has prior to The Big Short, mostly done comedies with Will Ferrell so the step in this direction and the Oscar nominations was definitely unexpected.To be perfectly honest, I didn't care that much for the film. The financial crisis is fascinating and I understood that the film was to be about advanced house mortgages. Also, to make it easier for us the audience, they made Ryan Gosling into some sort of narrator who from time to time face the camera and explains to us what different things means. The biggest problem I had with The Big Short is that after you understood what it's all about, the financial crisis and how they made money on it, there's nothing left to rely on. The characters and their personal development is minimal, except for a couple of clichés by Carrell and Pitt, where they begin to moralize so that we the audience don't feel like everyone in the film is a greedy moron who makes money on other people's suffering. A boring mistake. Look at one of the most famous characters of all time, Michael Douglas' investor in the film Wall Street. He is a greedy moron but he is also a great character.I personally would rather have seen this film as a sort of mockumentary, a documentary with a touch of parody. The Big Short wants to be comical but at the same time to be taken seriously and I don't think this really works. A shorter documentary about the crisis with a comical approach would have been more interesting. We would have gotten rid of all the over the top moral cliché scenes. Strange is also that at some point in the film the characters travel to a private owned house and question the tenants about their house mortgage, and later come to the conclusion that they should bet against the entire USA economy. The scene only exist to make the situation more understandable to us but at the same time it just makes the characters look dumb and not believable investors. The Big Short was a good idea and it was interesting until I understood what it was all about. After that it just became predictable and boring. Practically no new information is revealed after about half of the film, and the entire film is over two hours. I grade it a 5.David - Filmografen",5,1,2,23 March 2016
Fifty Shades of Grey," A poor sexual movie from a mediocre novel
","Earlier this week it was finally time to watch the much talked about film, Fifty Shades of Grey, based on the book by the same name. For those of you who are not familiar with the story, it is about young Anastasia Steele who gets the opportunity to interview the billionaire Christian Grey. Their meeting creates heavy sparks between them and they later meet again and start to develop feelings for each other. But, Christian Grey is not like ordinary people. He has a very special taste when it comes to sexual activities, which Anastasia will soon discover.This film has been such a big topic for the last year and it has practically been impossible to avoid hearing about it. For instance, the director Sam Taylor-Johnson will not return to direct the sequels because apparently she constantly fought on set with writer E. L James about the dialogue and details from the script. In the leading roles we see Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey.Before I start to talk about the film I will say that I actually started reading the book, but I did not finish it. My first reaction now after I've seen Fifty Shades of Grey, is that it could have been made better. I feel that the film didn't go in the direction I think it was intended to. To my understanding, Fifty Shades of Grey is supposed to be about feminism and encouragement for women to also be able to explore their sexuality. I am uncertain if this message really did go through to the audience. In the film Anastasia seems to be eager to please others but rarely appears to do anything for herself. Perhaps this is the point of the film, but I feel that it could have been made differently to create a greater impact.This leads me directly to the second big problem of the film, the characters. There is no doubt that Christian Grey has a permanent scar from his teenage years, which makes him unable to love anyone else. Jamie Dornan actually makes him pretty insecure and we clearly feel that there's something else behind his hard shell. Perhaps this is the reason why some people have criticized his performance, because they feel that Christian should be more self-confident and macho. I however liked it and thought it made him more human. Dakota Johnson's take on the character Anastasia is harder for me to get. I feel like I never really understand why she falls for Christian in the first place, or whatever motivates her at all.There was of course a few things I did like about Fifty Shades of Grey. The music was almost always very fitting, except for Danny Elfman's film score, which at times felt a bit repetitive. Beside the music, I did like Seattle as a background and a lot of the production design was very well made, especially Christian's apartment. To summarize, I really don't know how I feel about the film. It does feel like it is too faithful to the book, despite the fact that the script excludes some plot lines. Perhaps it was E. L James constant interfering at the set that prevented director Sam Taylor-Johnson from having more creative freedom. I guess in the end I would have rather seen more character development than helicopter and glider flights, even if they did look good.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",3,2,4,7 April 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Legendary superheroes wasted on a messy mediocre script with over the top effects
","Last night it was finally time for it. In the words of Lex Luthor 'The greatest gladiator match in the history of the world'. I don't think an aggressive meeting between the two probably most famous superheroes of all time, can be described in any other way. So what did I expect from this film? I wanted a deep film about how Batman and Superman's paths cross and explode into a fantastic fight. Then they have to unite against a common enemy and form the foundation of Justice League. Henry Cavill returns as the man of steel and Ben Affleck takes on the part of the dark knight. Jessie Eisneberg plays the mad millionaire Lex Luthor, who's main goal has always been to destroy Superman.The truth is that Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is one big mess. My expectations about a deep fight between Batman and Superman went quickly down the toilet when a lot of other stuff took up space. It was Wonder Woman, Lois Lane the damsel in need, some sort of senator and of course a couple of weird dreams about the future, or was it the past? I didn't quite get that. Already there is an obvious lack of focus in the script. How hard can it be? Batman vs Superman and one enemy to fight. If you try anything else with more characters, you better know what you are doing because very few succeed when they try. Even Christopher Nolan didn't succeed in his last Batman film The Dark Knight Rises. In Batman V Superman it always feels as if they know that they are building it all up for the next great film with more heroes and greater conflicts. The result is that this film takes a beat, becomes unfocused and because of that, even worse. It contains a lot of small details that just went wrong. Tiny details usually shouldn't do that much harm to a film, but when we don't even know why Superman is angry with Batman or why Wonder Woman doesn't do anything besides stealing technical stuff from Batman, you are approaching deep water and playing with huge parts of the plot that because of that doesn't work.Lex Luthor is a good enemy. He is young, smart, a millionaire, a little sick in the head and not a strong man. Yet he can do so much harm and be very disturbing. The film scrapes on the shell of this character but we never understand why he is the way he is, or why he does certain things. Why does he hate Superman? Beats me. The film has strong parts that at times, lift it. Jeremy Irons as Alfred, stabs and quarrel quite humorously with Batman. I also personally as a journalist student, think that it is incredibly fun to watch Laurence Fishbourne as a crazy newspaper editor obsessed with coming up with good headlines for his stories. Very entertaining. Well to summarize, I will admit that it is a superhero film and it shouldn't be taken too seriously and most of all not immediately be compared to Nolan's Batman films. It is an entertaining film with nice computer effects and great acting. Perhaps at times too much computer effects, but I can look past it because after all it is Superman. However, I still feel that a more clear and simple idea back in the process of writing the screenplay, would have given the film a more deep focus and the result of that would have been us understanding the characters and their actions. There are more to wish for, come on Warner Bros.David Lindahl www.filmografen.se",5,4,8,31 March 2016
Deadpool," An odd and fun parody on the genre
","Deadpool, this crazy superhero that mercilessly kills and refuses to call himself a hero. Wade Wilson is an ex special forces operative who after his service works as a mercenary in New York. He meets the prostitute Vanessa and falls in love, but cancer forces him away from her. After voluntarily signing up to a clinic that claims to be able to cure his illness, he is deceived and tortured until his body deforms and mutate so he gets superhuman powers. Ashamed of his new appearance and driven by revenge, he takes the alter ego Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds plays the red avenger that half mad kills his way through the underworld of New York, looking for his creator.Deadpool joins Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, as Marvel's latest more comical superhero films. The humor has always been there in the Marvel films, but these three films at times, belongs to the comedy genre. Deadpool is really a sort of parody that both mocks and salutes the superhero genre. Movie references and classic clichés are fired in all directions when Deadpool also turns to speak directly into the camera. Also sometimes the film completely stops and our hero narratively and humorously explains exactly what is happening. It's sort of playing with the genre and mixing different styles, matching Deadpool's crazy personality.It is Ryan Reynold's interpretation of Deadpool that is the driving force of the film. Many scenes last quite a while so that we all can get in on his jokes but the rest of the film actually isn't that long. I guess that's the weak spot of it. When we've understood Deadpool as a character and the parody around the genre, there's not that much left to lean on. The British villain's motive to mutate other people and his personal grudge against Deadpool's sassy attitude, eventually gets tiresome. Even Deadpool's jokes are at times childishly foolish and also the brutal violence loses its meant effect after too many decapitated heads. The best thing about the film is actually the short romance between Wade and Vanessa at the beginning. I want to see an entire romantic comedy with just the two of them. However, I don't think that Deadpool should be taken as serious as other superhero films. It is a small and odd contribution to the Marvel family, meant to provoke and take other paths than their big flagships. Light, odd and smart.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,6,17,30 April 2016
Spectre," The classic Bond formula is back and I like it
","Last Friday it was finally time to go and see the new James Bond film Spectre. Daniel Craig returns for his fourth run as the British spy 007 and this time he brings Christoph Waltz as his nemesis. Sam Mendes also returns as a director after the success of Skyfall which of course raised my expectations even more. Craig's Bond films have been formed by a rethinking concept both for the good and bad. With Casino Royale they tried to restart the series with Batman Begins as the main inspiration. In Skyfall they wanted to make Bond even more personal by digging in his past.Spectre is in a way the first real Bond film that Craig has done, and it delivers. The film does return to the more classic Bond concept that's been around ever since Goldfinger in 1964. A classic villain, technical gadgets, Bondgirls and exotic places. Craig also brings his a-game when it comes to charm and humour. In Spectre I really feel that he is just as cocky and confident as James Bond is supposed to be.It shall be noted that Spectre is the most expensive and the longest Bond film to date, and sometimes I feel it. With its 2 and a half hour long running time, there are definitely parts that feels slow for an action film. In the cinema I did notice it from time to time, but its nothing that really bothers me. Possibly it could have had a tighter and faster editing at certain parts, but on the other hand those slow moments builds up the tension and expectation of what's to come next.I was impressed by Spectre and despite its long running time I think it will eventually be a classic. In my opinion it is definitely together with Skyfall the greatest Bond film Craig has ever made. It really feels as he brought the character of James Bond to the exact point where he wants him to be. He also gets good help from a most scary performance by Christoph Waltz as the villain and also the fantastic Léa Seydoux as Madeleine Swann. Spectre is definitely worth your time.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",7,1,6,8 April 2016
Joy," Like all David O.Russell movies, too much character focus and not enough plot
","Joy is based on the true story about Joy Mangano who designed amongst else the Miracle Mop. David O. Russell is directing, and as always he has gathered his usual group of band of brothers, Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro. Joy, played by Lawrence, is a young woman who is forced to take care of her ungrateful family as they expect her to do everything for them. When she one day comes up with the idea of making a mop that wrings itself, she goes to her father, Robert De Niro, for help to create a business.Joy is unfortunately a pretty boring movie. The idea of a woman who becomes an entrepreneur and creates her own business empire, is very interesting but O. Russell throws it all away on strange side stories, such as her father and his demanding girlfriend, a strange TV guy who apparently doesn't know how to sell things despite it being his job. There's also the jealous sister and their strange mother who does nothing else but watch soap operas all day long. If O. Russell really wanted to tell a great story about a successful woman he should have toned down the side characters substantially and focused more on Lawrence's character as a struggling mother and entrepreneur. We get that the family is weighing her down after about 10 minutes into the film, but O. Russell continues to go on and on about it through the entire film.The film is almost exactly 2 hours and it feels way too long. A film like Joy, should be able to stress for 2 hours and still feel interesting. That is if the script had been more interesting. I also really think that O. Russell needs to mix up his choice of actors. To see Lawrence in yet another role she looks way too young to play and De Niro with Cooper in strange supporting roles, are just tiresome. It feels like I'm watching the same film over and over again. Don't get me wrong, director and actor collaborations can work. Just look at John Wayne and John Ford, or Leonardo DiCaprio with Martin Scorsese. But if so, the director and the actors must show more range or stick to a winning concept. That's not the case with O. Russell's latest movies. The thing he does well is choose great music, costumes and production design, but what good does that do when the movie itself is boring. Too bad, because the story about Joy is interesting. I grade it a four.David - Filmografen",4,1,3,23 March 2016
Warcraft," Lacks character motivations but succeeds in creating a fantastic world of conflict
","After several years of back and forth, the game giant Blizzard finally united and chose Duncan Jones as director and leader of their first film, Warcraft: The Beginning. It is based on the first Warcraft game from 1994. Azeroth is the world where the humans for several years have lived in peace together with the other creatures. The orcs are forced to leave their dying world Dreanor behind and travel to Azeroth to survive. The crazy orc Gul'dan lead them into battle with the help of the warcheif Blackhand. But all orcs are not impressed with their thirst for blood and their lack of respect for life. Conflicts appear in several directions. I have played these games when I was younger and I am also pretty familiar with the story because I've read some novels and facts about it.I will start by saying that Warcraft is an incredibly good looking film. The computer made effects combined with real actors, makes for a nice contrast very fitting to the style of the film. However, the characters of the film are a bit messy. It is a lot of characters on both sides and also certain ones who hasn't chosen a side which makes it even harder to keep track on everyone. We are quickly thrown into the story without a proper background explanation which is a pity and may cause confusion before you really understand everything. I like the fact that they have chosen to focus on both sides of the conflict. It makes the battle so much more interesting when we can follow it from two angles with two perspectives.The big weakness of the film also lies in the characters and their at times lack of development. Sometimes we are quickly cutting from one scene to another without ever really staying long enough to get to know anyone. This forces the filmmakers to use cliché dialogue to quickly make us understand what's going on. They've also added a forced love story. The thing that's really good about the film is the story itself. The conflict between the humans and the orcs who just invaded their world is very interesting. I personally really like following the orcs. They have everything to gain after leaving a dying world behind. When we follow them we also see their family situations with children and life mates. I care about them. Medivh, the guardian of Azeroth is also very interesting when he uses his magic. Warcraft is like I said, a bit messy and at times clumsy edited with strange short scenes and fading black screens. I do however like the world and the conflict itself so I forgive these blunders. It's no masterpiece but definitely an entertaining fantasy film.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,4,9,1 June 2016
Me Before You," An emotional ride taking a serious subject a little too lightly
","I Went to the movies recently and saw Me Before You, the film based on the novel with the same name by the author Jojo Moyes. It is about the eccentric girl Louisa Clark who lives in an English village with her working class family. After getting fired from the small café she works in, she desperately accepts employment as a caretaker of the paralyzed young man Will Traynor. He is a wealthy ex business man who got paralyzed when he got hit by a motorcycle. Will is bitter and unpleasant towards everything and everyone around him. Me Before You is directed by the relatively unknown Thea Sharrock and this is her first feature film. Emilia Clarke, known from Game of Thrones plays Louisa and Sam Claflin, mostly known from The Hunger Games series, portrays the paralyzed Will.First I want to say that Me Before You is really a British film. Working class meet upper class, they clash and break down social barriers. I also think that Louisa is a pretty typical British 'film girl'. She wears extremely colorful clothes, is constantly happy, a bit weird and often quite oblivious to the serious situations around her. When she meets Will it is at first very tense, he mostly ignores her and she desperately wants to get out of there. They of course soon become attracted to each other because they really are each other's opposites. She is fascinated by his world, his personally and also in my opinion a bit by his disability. She in turn for him becomes a happy, clumsy and carefree girl like no one he ever met before in his organized and sterile world.The director Thea Sharrock relies very much on close-ups and reaction shots. This is good, and sometimes not so good. Too much close-ups on a face can easily remove the body language and also make us interpret every single facial expression as something very important. Sometimes we stay to long on Louisa's face. Her smile and her tilted gaze always seems to want to say something and I wonder if that really is what they were aiming for. However they succeed very well in a certain face shaving scene I consider as one of the best ones in the film.Me Before You is a very heavy film and touches a very sensitive subject that shall remain unknown because it is a major spoiler. I do think that the filmmakers take this too lightly and offer a very simple answer that in reality should be a lot more complicated. Also, the film doesn't go all the way and actually chicken out during what I believe was a very defining moment. A bit weak actually. But the film and especially the author should have credit for daring to speak about it. The overall impression is that they actually manage to finish the film in the way they planned. Our entire emotional register is played out during these barely two hours. We laugh, we get angry, confused and we cry. Not a dry eye in the theater. But for me to become more involved and drawn to the story, it would require more focus on the sensitive subject. Offer no direct answers, ask us the audience questions and let us sit by the end of the film with our heads filled with thoughts. That would according to me have given the film more depth. Also the clichés and the music would have to be toned down. The music was at times very bombastic and tiresome.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6,0,4,6 July 2016
