Angels & Demons," Shame...
","Ron Howard and his 'editors' only had one job to do... Follow the guidelines of the book which was 'rich', 'mysterious', 'moving' and highly cinematic in its approach! What they did? They changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What is left is something that has no right being called 'Angels & Daemons'! I really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for 'this' film.I really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made, it is pointless.......",6,9,14,31 August 2009
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Art of making money out of nothing..
","Let me state that I enjoyed the first two movies and actually thought that there was something of value in the story behind the silly teenage action flick..This movie (and I suppose also the book) is a complete let down and a total failure. They built a promise and let it die at the end, when they should have pushed forward the story and create 'something' of value.In world where the authority demands, oppresses and ruthlessly punishes by death thousands of common (unarmed) folk we spend 2h+ wondering what will happen to Peeta (or whatever the hell he is called) and if he will survive... Katniss fake romance with one of the most sleazy and obnoxious characters in film history takes new heights in this latest installment. Katniss is 'so much in love' with this troll that she can't walk straight in this whole movie which turns it to a complete parody. I never liked this character from the start but I was willing to let go. Now his presence (and the importance bestowed upon him) is simply unbearable to watch. Another thing that is really lame in this film (which kind of worked in the previous ones) is the fact that the fate of the revolution depends on whether Katniss will wear leather of silk this evening and whether she will have a ponytail... As I said in the 1st one it had it's place but now it feels completely ridiculous! People die left and right and the presidents spend their time trying to convince a bunch of teenagers to come to their side.. The obvious fact that every finale MUST be split into 2-3 parts to maximize profit does not even warrant the need to comment on.. even when the story itself cannot even cover 90 min.I agree with most people saying that I will not watch p.2!",2,16,22,22 March 2015
It Chapter Two," Where is the tension? Where is the Horror?? The atmosphere???
","I knew it was going to be bad (even though I hoped it would at least have some creepy moments) because the 1st one was also bad. But I still could not help myself.. Still hoping for a worthy adaptation of a king novel (there are a couple).The cast is good, acting ok but the 'scares' are hilarious. The scene at the Chinese place was straight out of a star wars circus.There is every cliche in the book with extra pointer to make sure 'you get it'.. Blasphemous references to actual cult films (Alien, Shining, The Thing, Nightmare on Elm St, etc) that feel more like an insult than homage.
NOT ONE moment of tension. NOT A SINGLE scene with atmosphere...Enough said, I can only blame the 'director' for this screw-up.",3,6,14,6 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The repeat strikes back..
","For me JJ Abrams is a synonym to quality productions, not memorable or full of sentiment movies but quality, illustrious, polished end- product. And Episode VII is just that. A polished version of the previous films. And in that aspect it is very good indeed. As for the plot and the neoterisms that it brings to the franchise then I must admit it fails miserably..It is a common knowledge that Hollywood hasn't got the ability, anymore, to produce what we used to call 'Movies'. Instead you get brain-dead action sequences that make anyone, who is above 8-9 years old, roll their eyes or at best laugh.. Characters are 'in the way' of a good blockbuster and story also. So why should EpVII be any different? Well it isn't.The Director/Producer decided instead of pissing off the Fans like he did with Star-Trek and change the whole history of the saga by 'whipping out' the future to play it 'safe'. What is safe?? Just repeat whatever come before and worked at that time..1. The elderly/wise character that tries to bring down evil with nothing more than his open heart and dies on the hands of the villain (always at the 1st part of each trilogy).. It remains to be seen if he also comes back as an astral projection like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui- Gon Jinn.2. There is a small R2D2 like robot that carries the most important info and is sought by the bad guys.3. We have, yet again, another Death Star like EpIV & EpVI which of course is bigger but easier to destroy than the previous ones.4. All the Heroes/Villains tend to originate from the same family tree... The force is indeed strong in them :P5. The new Darth wears a similar outfit and helmet and has a similar voice even though it is not supported by any cause, the original Vader had health issues that supported his outfit and helmet/voice.6. The new DS can only be destroyed by taking out a specific part that can only be attacked when the shields are down from the planet surface (rings any bells??).7. We get the same intergalactic bar full of the whole cast of Muppet show, 'for the fans'.., which was cheesy even the 1st time I saw it and more so now 25 years later..8. The Empire is destroyed but the new Empire (whatever it is called) has the same Battleships, the same StormTroopers, the same Tie Fighters and the new Vader also has the some ship......9. Even though the 'Empire was destroyed' the rebellion is still called the rebellion (who were they rebelling against.?) wear the same outfits and fly the exact same aircrafts that they used 40 years ago... I guess being the Rebellion does not produce enough revenue for some basic R&D.10. The Wise Jedi master lives secluded on a desert planet after having failed to inspire his pupils to follow the Light side.. 1st Yoda now Luke..The unknown protagonists are a good thing and they pull of their parts quite nice. I don't mean the new Vader who I have to agree with others that he should have never removed his helmet.. talk about anti- climax..It is fun to watch but it fails to introduce anything new to the saga, something that would breathe some life into a 30 years old corpse.. It is a same when considering the amount of resources at their disposal and the technology factor that makes it easy for them to accomplish anything they would..",6,4,11,21 December 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," The Retarded Cabin in the (so called) woods!
","This brain dead film scored 7.6 in user IMDb ratings and, believe it or not, 90% in critic ratings (RT)... 90%, yes, Really!!! We have a movie that troughs in the blender some of the most iconic horror images and scenarios and presents it all as NEW, Refreshing and 'Black Comedy'.. In order to pull something like that off you must first know what material you are using, 2nd you must Respect the material and 3rd you must have some talent... These guys have none of the above!!!!Spoilers Follow!!!The 'movie' starts as an Evil Dead rip-off, then continues to incorporate a 'Truman Show' element (far too early to have any impact..), then it decides to through in some zombies and later on all kinds of crap to 'make it stick..'. The most idiotic and completely stupid fact is the whole 'show' thing that has been going on (for ages). A show that goes on worldwide and nobody sees! Except perhaps for the overseers themselves. Around the world sacrifices are being made for some OLD ONES (here comes Cthulhu) but not as any intelligent person would choose to (get them, kill them and use their blood..) but through a parody where these individuals are lured into a so called cabin where they choose which monster or atrocity will kill them.! Because Cthulhu doesn't want a simple sacrifice but to see them suffer (and they can only suffer in the hands of zombies, ghosts, werewolves and other creatures that are conveniently tucked away in a nearby storage area). And these monster are REAL, not some androids made to look like them but the real deal.. mmm OK. Then comes the CUBE element, where all these are stored and operated in a cube like structure inside glass cages (and we all know how easy it is to store ghosts and other spirits inside an elevator).We also have the girl from Silent Hill, and a dude that refers to Pinhead. And yes they even have a Cracken inside one of these 2m x 2m champers!! .ok And then comes the crown jewel! The sacrifice chamber where they need a 'HO', an 'athlete' , a 'scholar', a 'jester' and a 'Virgin' (who has been screwing with her professor as we first learn in the movie..) to appease Cthulhu! One question for the enlightened minds that wrote this crap, and the critics that praised it, which one of the elementary school Japanese girls (from the Tokyo show) is the 'Ho' and which is the 'scholar'???90% approval by official critics Lameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",1,14,30,21 August 2012
