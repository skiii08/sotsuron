The Devil's Advocate," Yet Another Al Pacino 'By The Numbers' Movie. All 'Shtick' And CGI
","Behold! Al Pacino, over-acting! Behold! Al Pacino engaging in loud, bombastic and long-winded speeches! Behold! Keanu Reeves looking so puzzled, for LONG stretches of the movie, when the obvious has been made clear to the viewer, early on! Behold! Al Pacino lipsyncing to Frank Sinatra's, 'It Happened in Monterrey,' while prancing about a very large room, filled with computer generated images of heavenly (and not so heavenly) statues, engaged in all manners of horseplay! Behold! A stupefyingly LOUD musical soundtrack, filled with heavenly (and not so heavenly) religious symbolism, and STILL Keanu Reeves doesn't 'get it!' Behold! Uber-Babes, Charlize Theron and Connie Nielsen, disrobing to full-frontal nudity! Behold! More F-words than even 'Goodfellas!' Oh, my God (pardon me, He's implied in this picture, but He must've missed His cue), I could go on and on with the 'Beholds!' Look, THIS movie is 144 minutes of Al Pacino ranting, raving and over-acting. THIS movie is for the myriad of high school and college students, out there, that got by with 'crib sheets.' I mean, unlike Roman Polanski's FAR superior, 'Rosemary's Baby,' and Paul Wendkos, 'The Mephisto Waltz,' there is absolutely NO subtlety expressed in this film, WHATSOEVER! It just continues to beat you over the head, until you are so thankful when the end credits FINALLY roll. For the benefit of cretins who STILL don't 'get it,' think Beelzebub, Satan, Lucifer and 'Old Scratch.' NOW do you 'get it?' Good, it only took Keanu Reeves 143 minutes to arrive at the same conclusion! If you want good Al Pacino (and not heavy-handed schlock), rent 'The Godfather,' 'Dog Day Afternoon,' 'Scarface,' 'The Godfather Part II,' 'Carlito's Way,' 'Donnie Brasco,' 'The Insider' or 'Insomnia.' In 'The Devil's Advocate,' he's just phoning it in. TOTAL prostitution. Just in it for the bucks, so he can afford to play Shakespeare, off-Broadway.",4,2,6,6 January 2005
Ghost," Good show!
","This movie was released in July of 1990, it cost $22,000,000.00 to make, and it has returned over $517,000,000.00 in profits. If 'Striptease' was the nadir of Demi Moore's film career (thus far), then THIS has to be considered her apex! Look, Patrick Swayze runs the acting gamut from 'A' to 'B' (thank you Dorothy Parker for that put-down!) - he has all the charm of a wooden Indian - but he helps make the movie work. Just like he did in 'Dirty Dancing.' Hey, THIS movie doesn't just 'work,' it SOARS! Bottom line, I'm a guy, but at the first refrains of the Righteous Brothers' hit song, 'Unchained Melody - and the first appearances of teardrops under the eyes of Demi Moore - I LOST it! Okay, SO it's a 'chick flick,' we should ALL get in touch with our feminine side, sometimes!",Null,3,5,13 July 2004
Pretty Woman," I admit it, I'm a sucker for a 'pretty woman!'
","No, I don't 'follow' the reviews of 'autumnshowers' (the preceding reviewer), but I read his/her (?) account of this movie and found it utterly pretentious and completely wrong. Before I begin with MY review of 'Pretty Woman,' I have to warn you, I'm biased:  This movie is one of my Top Ten Movies of All Time.  Why, you ask?  1)  Julia Roberts in a star- making role.  2)  Richard Gere, who must've realized somewhere during filming that he was playing second fiddle to a young woman in a star-making role.  3)  Jason Alexander at his smarmiest best.  In his eventual obituary (a LONG time from now, we hope!), they'll probably recap that he once slapped Julia Roberts silly in this movie (I know, HISSSSS!!!). 4)  Laura San Giacomo in yet ANOTHER great supporting role.  5)  Hector Elizondo (a fixture in movies directed by Garry Marshall) at his all-time scene-stealing finest.  I love to watch this movie (I've seen it between 50 to 100 times - I know the dialogue by heart) just to see the looks on Elizondo's face when he shares a scene with Roberts.  They run the gamut from reproach to pity to acceptance to admiration and finally to warm respect.                                          {SPOILER WARNING}The scene at the end of the movie in which Elizondo (as hotel manager, 'Barney' Thompson) kisses Roberts' hand, when she extends it for a handshake, and says, 'come back and see us, again, sometime,' never fails to tug at my heart.  I mean, these two have  really gone through some character development, together.  In Elizondo's final scene in the movie, he agrees to return a necklace and matching earrings, given to him by Richard Gere, to the store he borrowed them from.  Elizondo opens the jewelry box and says, 'it must be difficult to part with something as beautiful as this.'  Of course, he's not talking about the jewelry, he's talking about Julia Roberts who parted company with Gere (reluctantly) the day before.  This sets in motion the BIG reconciliation scene on the fire escape of Roberts' seedy apartment.  Yeah, I know, this movie is about as believable as the Red Sox winning the World Series, but - to me - it's a veritable delight from beginning to end.  No matter how low I feel, this movie ALWAYS brings a smile to my face.  So, WHAT'S so wrong with that?  As a matter of fact, Cinemax is showing this movie TWICE, tomorrow - at 6:15 a.m., and again at 4:00 p.m.  I'll be in the viewing audience, too.  Why?  'It's the best!'  I know what you're thinking:  WHY doesn't he just tape it?  Well, I did.  However, I like it better when I know OTHER people are watching it at the same time as me.  You know, like sitting in a movie theatre?  The best part is knowing that at least some of these people are watching for the first time. How I envy them!",Null,16,19,5 August 2004
