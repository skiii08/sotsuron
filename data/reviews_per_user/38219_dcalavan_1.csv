Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worst Movie ever
","This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. This man doesn't know when to stop. He has no concept of respect or responsibility for ones actions. This movie cost one innocent person in Mississippi their job already, exploited the poor in Romania, and disgraced the art of film making forever. The people in this film are unwitting participates in the awful excuse for a movie. I am sorry that I even spent money to see this movie and if I were able to see it again for free, I wouldn't waste my time.It is completely fine to make a satirical film and pick on everyone, which Cohen did, but there is a line between satire and complete and total distaste. This movie was so uncomfortable to watch I wanted to leave it and despised the fact that I was in there the whole time. I'm not sure how long the movie is, but it seemed to last an eternity. The only reason I stayed is because I was with a friend, and he had the keys.Please do not waste your time or money on this terrible excuse for entertainment and film. Russia banned this movie, and the citizens of the U.S. should too.",Null,6,12,15 November 2006
