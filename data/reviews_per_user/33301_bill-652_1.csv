Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Six thumbs and one tentacle up!
","How long has this movie been out, 2 years? It weathers well. This film is a fine blend of action and real plot intrigue, and there are no dead spots to wade through. Something about that pod race that sucks you in every time. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman, who can in fact act their way through a wet paper bag, do very well at not bringing more than they should to their roles. You catch just the hint of self-amusement in all of them, enough to make the movie that much more enjoyable. How the heck do you do a scene interacting with characters that will be drawn in later? Beats the cheese out of me, but everyone pulls it off. Perhaps the Stars Wars films, with the exception of Return of the Jedi, will be the charter films of the SciFi/Western genre.",Null,0,0,17 January 2001
