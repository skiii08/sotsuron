The Blair Witch Project," I waisted my money
",I couldn't believe how poorly the movie was made. There was nothing scary about the film. This is the only movie I have seen where the whole audience boo-ed at the end. Don't waste your money. The movie was really a disappointment.,1,0,1,6 November 1999
