Ford v Ferrari," Riveting reenactment of a remarkable race
","Back in the 1960s, Ferrari's racing team was the one to beat on the track. This is the story of how Ford Motor Company took on Ferrari in 1966 and won, with the help of automotive designer Carroll Shelby and race driver Ken Miles. The Ford team constructed the formidable GT40 which emerged victorious at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Those who were previously unaware or oblivious of this juicy bit of history will find themselves captivated by its reenactment on celluloid. The film runs two and a half hours, yet it does not drag, thanks to a tight script and solid performances, superbly-edited racing sequences along with a music score that enhances the action onscreen. Matt Damon once again proves why he is one of the finest actors of his generation; he is absolutely spot-on in his portrayal of Shelby as a man with passion, confidence and determination. I love watching him in movies like this one and also Invictus. Christian Bale's performance as Ken Miles, while a little more mannered, still manages to beautifully capture the character's extremes of tenderness and cockiness. Also noteworthy is Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II; he shows that the magnate can have a commanding presence yet break down upon experiencing an epiphany. Ford v Ferrari brings a nugget of racing history to life through this well-assembled movie which is worth catching especially on the big screen.",9,6,16,14 November 2019
Kung Fu Panda," He's funny, he's adorable; he's The Incredible Bulk
","Po (voiced by the incredibly talented Jack Black) is a fat panda who likes kung fu but never dreamed that he would one day be chosen as the Dragon Warrior. He also never imagined having to fight the fearsome Tai Lung (Ian McShane), who is as mean and vicious as villains come. The reluctant fighter gets help in preparing for his showdown from Master Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), and the interaction between teacher and student provide many of the laughs. There's a lot more going on around this simple storyline, and the movie is filled with comedy and action from start to finish. The animation is brilliantly done, the characters' facial expressions are priceless while the kung fu action is flawless. Although much of the humor is action-based, there's also much wit and satire in the script along with a good dose of tenderness and heart. Among the many lovable characters, my favorites are Po, Master Shifu and Master Oogway, an even older and wiser teacher who decided that there's no reason why an ordinary panda cannot be a superhero if he just believed in himself.",8,3,6,20 June 2008
Rocketman," Thanks for sharing Your Song, Elton John
","I grew up listening to Elton John songs. His hits came out just when i was old enough to appreciate them, and so his songs have bookmarked my life. I have always admired Elton John as a performer so when Rocketman was released, i made sure not to miss it. And i am glad i didn't. What a treat for a fan. The songs from the first half of his career are in the movie, woven seamlessly into the storyline so that this really is a musical biopic. The actors do a great job, especially Taron Egerton who sings just like the Man himself; the portrayal is really on point. Songs like Crocodile Rock and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road transported me back to the days of my youth. Thanks for the memories!",8,2,3,15 June 2019
A Star Is Born," A kinder, gentler version of a showbiz tale
","So this is yet another version of the ever-popular story of a showbiz star helping a newcomer in business and then becoming the has-been.
Compared with the earlier adaptations, this one by Bradley Cooper is kinder and gentler in tone (there's even a dog!), though i find the one by Frank Pierson more gripping and enjoyable.
Cooper's Jackson is definitely more charming than Kristofferson's John Norman, but Lady Gaga's Ally doesn't blow you away like how Streisand's Esther did. Still, one finds these characters actually likable while the ones in previous versions were far less sympathetic.
The songs in this new version are just okay, while the ones sung by Streisand and Kristofferson in 1976 were more catchy and I remember how i just couldn't stop listening to that soundtrack then. Maybe 'Shallow' sticks a little better, because of the hook.",8,2,5,7 October 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek's stunning superior sequel
","I enjoyed the Star Trek reboot that was released in 2009, so much so that i thought that would have been hard to top. This superlative sequel proved me wrong. Kudos to the writers for a character-driven action screenplay that is laced with smart humor. Director J.J. Abrams nicely balances the action, suspense and drama without losing any steam in the middle but with regular edge-of-the-seat moments. The cast is a fine ensemble, but Chris Pine's standout performance as Captain Kirk confirms him as one of the finest actors of his generation. Also adding to the movie's attributes are the special visual effects, well-choreographed fight sequences and the sublime music score. A truly spectacular effort that exceeds expectations.",8,3,6,23 June 2013
Us," A spooky tale for the ages
","Eerie, creepy and spooky. Forget about the storyline logic, or lack of it, and just get in for the ride. And what an unpredictable ride it will turn out to be. The cast is excellent, each character playing two versions of themselves, but the standout is definitely Lupita Nyong'o who just wows as both main and tethered personalities. The cinematography is spot on, and so is the music score. This is a horror movie that will make your skin crawl more than have you jumping out of fright. But writer-producer-director Jordan Peele definitely laid out a tale that will win him respect from his peers and which horror movie fans will turn into a cult favorite.",8,2,6,8 April 2019
The Flowers of War," A tale of tragedy, sacrifice and hope
","This Zhang Yimou movie on the Rape of Nanking starts off unevenly, but thankfully, everything begins to fall into place by the halfway mark. At first, it is hard to care about the characters, as they are not introduced properly. However, we get to know each of them as the story slowly unfolds and, towards the end, one might even be choking back some tears. The acting is superb throughout. Christian Bale's casting is meaningful because his first movie was Empire of the Sun, which was also about the Japanese invasion of China. In the space of 25 years, we see him at the beginning of his career in master-director Spielberg's Empire, and as a seasoned actor in master-director Zhang's Flowers. The film is beautifully shot, and the music score also features solos by Joshua Bell. Suffice to say, production values are top notch.",7,0,2,25 April 2012
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tim Burton takes on a Broadway masterpiece
","Tim Burton is one of my favorite movie directors, Stephen Sondheim is my favorite Broadway composer/lyricist, while Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are among my favorite actors. So you can imagine how eagerly i was awaiting to enjoy this version of Sweeney Todd, the Broadway masterpiece, on the big screen. Well, was it up to my expectations? The first time i saw this movie, i was expecting too much because i was already so familiar with the stage version. However, the second time i saw it, i appreciated it a lot more. I had another chance to examine the movie's strengths, which there are indeed. The look is classically graphic, while the orchestrations involve Paul Gemignani and Jonathan Tunick - two experts on works by Sondheim. Yes, some numbers were unnecessarily cut off or shortened, including No Place Like London and Ah Miss!, both of which would have nicely added a softer, more humanistic, touch to the otherwise relentlessly gloomy proceedings. The By the Sea number was also sadly shortened and poorly edited. Although A Little Priest was not my favorite number of the musical, it was the best presented in the movie despite it also having been shortened. The acting is overall really superb, even if Helena Bonham Carter was a little too subdued as Mrs Lovett, although that makes you really feel for her character. But then, Mrs Lovett is supposed to be vile, and unlike Angela Lansbury's stage incarnation who spits her words out while chirpily enjoying manipulating Sweeney Todd, here Bonham Carter tries to sing melodically and as a result, she deprives the character of the oomph befitting a lead role. Nevertheless, she is still deliciously good, while Johnny Depp is amazing. The film is superbly edited too. And the way the blood in the movie spurts and gushes out is really reminiscent of the horror movies of old, which Burton and Depp supposedly love.",8,1,3,24 January 2008
Life of Pi," Life-affirming tale that resonates
","I should first confess that i have not read Yann Martel's novel, am not a vegetarian, and do not believe that all religions are the same. All that notwithstanding, i love this movie with the inspiring message that if life throws you lemons, make lemonade. When Indian boy Pi Patel faces taunts in school, he turns that to his advantage. When, as a teenager, he becomes shipwrecked and shares a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger, he learns to deal with the situation and because he never gives up hope, he gets to be amazed by the wonderful experiences brought about by his predicament. Suraj Sharma injects his performance with a combination of innocence and tenacity, while the virtual tiger named Richard Parker is an impressive work of art. Both complement each other beautifully. The screenplay is sharp and observant, while the music score is striking yet unobtrusive. Yes, director Ang Lee has delivered yet another masterpiece.",8,1,3,15 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," From one cliffhanger to another
","What an ending for a finale of the final trilogy for the Star Wars saga! Here, we see the return of the original characters including Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO, Lando Calrissian and Palpatine/Darth Sidious along with newer ones like Rey, Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, Finn and Poe. There is never a dull moment with so many twists, surprises and cliffhangers from start to finish. Everyone acted well, and the visual effects were impressive. What a ride this has been, and now there is compelling need to watch the entire saga starting with The Phantom Menace. Let's roll!",9,3,7,2 January 2020
The Last Legion," A little too fantastic to be believable
","This movie kind of reminds me of the lower-budgeted Greek and Roman lesser epics of the 1960s -- still watchable as long as your expectations are not too high. I'm sure much of this film's budget probably went to its A-list cast, which i have to admit was the main reason for my going to see it. That said, the best performance came from young Thomas Sangster as the boy emperor Romulus. He more than holds his own against his veteran co-stars, and he delivered all his lines perfectly. As for delicious Aishwarya Rai, she looks good and fights well enough to justify being given the part of the woman warrior. Rather disappointing were Colin Firth, who looked like he was having second thoughts about taking the role, and Sir Ben Kingsley, who gives his philosopher-sorcerer an Indian accent as if he was another Gandhi. And the great Harry Van Gorkum is masked throughout the movie so you don't even get to see him until the very end. Story-wise, while the first half of the movie is almost a snooze, at least the last half-hour picks up and it ends quite satisfactorily.",6,1,3,19 October 2007
Ratatouille," A most delicious Ratatouille to be savored many times
","Let me declare this outright, Brad Bird is pure genius and on top of that, one with a lot of class. Here is an animated feature with EVERYTHING: comedy, suspense, satire, an engaging story, brilliant artwork and superb voice-overs, a fine music score (although no Randy Newman song *sniff*) and all that topped up with LOTS of Pizazz. As a critic, i always look out for flaws; as a movie-lover, i tend to be forgiving. In this case, there are hardly any flaws to speak of and so, nothing to forgive. Animated rats have always been cute, but the ones here are not only lovable but very realistically characterised as well. While this animated feature may have been made with the adult viewer in mind, there is more than enough of the fun factor thrown in so that the younger ones will find it appealing as well. At the same time, many life lessons were included as part of the story; thankfully, these were not imparted in a heavy-handed way. This is indeed a hearty feast for all the senses, and one to be savored over and over again.",9,2,3,16 August 2007
Yesterday," Interesting concept but too ambitious in execution
","First, what i enjoyed most in this movie is Kate McKinnon's delightful performance as a ruthless agent. Hers stands out among generally decent performances from the rest of the cast, and deserves an Oscar nomination for supporting actress.
The movie as a whole is a pretty shameless piece of work, perhaps not unlike McKinnon's character Debra Hammer. While the concept is interesting, those behind it try to take on too much and end up spoiling everything. One is allowed to be far-fetched up to a point and beyond that, the whole premise falls apart.
One suspects the whole idea behind this project is to make money from songs by the Beatles. On a positive note, at least it may introduce some new fans to the body of work. However, Yesterday the song was not rendered well, and including Back in the USSR is totally out of place and meaningless.
On the whole, one would give the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt and believe that their nostalgic intentions are good. One just wishes that they were more restrained and just focused on the sweet love affair in the middle, without wrapping it with so much ribbons, glitter and confetti.",6,1,2,28 August 2019
The Favourite," Refreshing life breathed into historical characters
","You don't have to love history to enjoy this movie, but this movie will make you more interested in history. The script is deliciously written, and is based on the intimate relationship between two women using power and influence, and a third one who comes in to disrupt that relationship. Emma Stone is amazing, Rachel Weisz is excellent, and Olivia Colman is great fun to watch. Nicholas Hoult, always impressive, has never been better. After watching this movie once, you will be haunted by it and want to watch it again.",9,7,13,28 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 1969 Hollywood, Tarantinized
","Real and fictional characters populate actual and imagined situations in Quentin Tarantino's mind-blowing saga aptly titled Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. For older viewers, it's a nostalgic trip back in time while many references may be lost on those who are younger unless they are themselves well-versed with that period in movie and TV history. The main real person in the movie is Sharon Tate and while we all know her story, we still wait with bated breath to see Tarantino's take on what he would have liked to see happen. Brad Pitt's character Cliff Booth is given the best lines, and they are all delivered with immense charm. Pitt is in top form here, and he is the movie's brightest spark. Leo DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is a more complicated role, a character riddled with self-doubts and who constantly needs reassuring, yet in his element at all other times. The movie is filled with interesting supporting parts, many of them played by veteran actors including several who had not been working for some time. This being a Tarantino movie, the viewer should not be expecting conventionality; the writer-director plays fast and loose with the facts and reality so much so that the phrase 'it's only a movie' becomes almost an understatement. My advice to first-time viewers is to just sit back and enjoy the ride; there will be a lot to take in, so a second viewing may be helpful. As long as you watch with an open mind, you won't end up too disappointed.",7,1,2,21 August 2019
Aladdin," A feast for the eye, mind and heart
","This live-action version of the Disney animated musical based on the story from the Arabian Nights provides enough spectacle and drama to please the eye and mind. Mena Massoud is a very winning Aladdin; the character's singing and choreography are impeccable. Will Smith is brilliant as the Genie; Robin Williams did a great job voicing the character in the animated version, and Smith takes that job up one level. Marwan Kenzari is a suitably threatening Grand Vizier; it is delicious watching him lap up the role. And Naomi Scott and Nasim Pedrad make a delightful pair as Princess Jasmine and her handmaiden Dahlia. Oh, and Abu the monkey is super great fun to watch, even for one who is generally not fond of monkeys. My three favorite songs in the movie -- One Jump Ahead, Friend Like Me and A Whole New World -- were well-executed and did not disappoint. All in all, a more-than-satisfactory entertaining two hours.",8,0,2,30 May 2019
Stardust," A magical tale with twists and surprises at every turn
","It's a long story, as one often says, but in this case, the ride is well worth it. Stardust is a wonderfully inventive fairy tale, filled with twists and surprises at every turn. If you enjoy movies like Ladyhawke, then you will like this one even more. And for a film that is just 127 minutes long, it sure packs a lot. The engaging storyline, accompanied by a rousing score, unfolds like a gift being teasingly unwrapped; and by the end, the package is neatly tied-up again, topped off with a resplendent bow. Young Charlie Cox leads a starry cast, and they all gamely deliver deliciously off-beat performances. Stardust is a visual feast, and a tale that satisfies both the mind and the heart.",9,1,1,10 November 2007
Lincoln," A time in history well worth recalling and remembering
","Here is a time in history that's well worth recalling and remembering. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln focuses on the final months of the great president's life, when he worked with rivals and supporters in government to pass the 13th constitutional amendment -- that's the one that emancipates the slaves. It's a handsome well-mounted production, with the drab look reflective of the period. Once again, Spielberg extracts superb performances from his mostly celebrated cast. Daniel Day-Lewis portrays the beleaguered president as a dignified and at the same time, very human, figure. However, my favorite character was Tad Lincoln played by the young Gulliver McGrath; amid all the (necessary) conniving and manipulation taking place in the capital city, he comes across as so innocent and carefree... until the tragic moment at the end. See this movie as a lesson on how clever political maneuvering by the wily president enabled the successful passage of a controversial bill.",7,0,2,10 March 2013
World Trade Center," An intimate perspective of what happened 'that day'
","In its own quiet way, Oliver Stone's World Trade Center grips the viewer as unimaginable events unfold around two ordinary men working in the security department of the port of New York. We all know what happened that day, and most would also know the outcome of what happened to these two men. The 9/11 event was, after all, one of the most widely covered by the media. Yet for those of us who think we already know it all, there is nothing like revisiting that fateful day through the eyes of those who were right there in the thick of it. Here, the recreation of Ground Zero is impressive. It is as if the viewer was right there on the Tuesday morning of 9/11, and also with the victims following the attacks. Nicholas Cage gives a suitably subdued performance as befits his screen character John McLoughlin, while feisty newcomer Michael Pena as Will Jimeno shows himself to be an actor with much promise. Overall, the film is superbly cast, and both Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal inhabit their wifely characters of Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno so well that they take your breath away. Donna's hugging scene near the end with a mother who was missing her son will bring lumps to one's throat. Unlike in other Oliver Stone movies, there is no posturing in this one. I was even compelled to see this movie twice, and i have to say that i cried more the second time around. This is maybe because the first time, i was just getting acquainted with the characters while the second time around, they were already like familiar friends. While what the suicide terrorists did on 9/11 was both evil and stupid and sickening, director Oliver Stone has helped to bring about some healing - local as well as global - through this movie. World Trade Center shows that the worst kinds of events can still bring out the best from those affected. On a more personal note, this is my favorite Oliver Stone film to date, and i never thought i'd see the day when i would even consider liking any film by this surprising director.",8,1,4,27 October 2006
The Hangover Part II," A sequel that is very hard not to like
","The hangover boys are back, and this time, they're in Bangkok. Sounds like a great location for a follow-up. I liked the first Hangover, though i found the story far-fetched, over-the-top and way too surreal. This sequel actually plays out more believably, believe it or not, despite a more convoluted plot. I was prepared to find fault, but i just ended up liking this movie far more than i expected. The wolf packers are as funny as ever, and i especially love the droll acting by Paul Giamatti. Ken Jeong is funny as ever, although less outrageously this time, while newcomer Mason Lee comes across as highly likable. One also can't help but grin when seeing the photographs shown during the end credits.",6,0,1,30 May 2013
Hotel Mumbai," Getting to relive a real-life ordeal
","This film manages to put the viewer in the thick of action during the attacks on Mumbai in November 2008. You follow the terrorists as they move from the harbor through the city and into the plush hotel, wreaking havoc wherever they go. In the hotel, you follow various guests and staff members as they try to hide and escape from the perpetrators. A truly compelling experience, like as if you are part of what is going on. The whole siege is well re-enacted and chillingly depicted with accuracy. By the end, you feel relief but also sadness over what had unfolded. The acting is uniformly superb. Dev Patel and Armie Hammer provide some star power, but everyone is impressive down to the bit parts.",8,12,32,6 May 2019
Avatar," A lame fairy tale for the gullible
","Avatar is a lame fairy tale, boring and cringe-worthy, that will appeal only to those who are gullible and easily taken in by an attempt to be fantastical. I love movies and sadly, this one not only bored me to tears but sitting through it was sheer torture, nothing less. And this from James Cameron, whose Terminator and Titanic are my two favorite movies of all time and whose many other films i have seen, loved and admired. The great Sigourney Weaver, who is a class act, delivers a serviceable performance at most. Sam Worthington fares better, although one wishes at times that he had a little more of the charisma of a Leo DiCaprio or a Johnny Depp. Then there is the villain Col Quaritch who is so cartoonish he might have come straight from the pages of a comic book. The biggest tragedy of Avatar is that after all the years and money invested, the final product is so insipid, unoriginal and uninspiring. The music score doesn't come anywhere near John Barry's Dances With Wolves or James Horner's Titanic. And what is most scary is when Hollywood starts making crap movies like this, there is no hope left for mankind.",2,17,42,23 December 2009
La La Land," Ooh la la! A timeless classic is born
","This movie has stolen my heart! I went into this movie with high expectations, and it soared above them. Thank you, Damien Chazelle, for a movie that can be savored over and over. Thank you, Justin Hurwitz, for a brilliant score that has stayed with me and replayed endlessly in my mind. Thank you, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, for being such a great screen couple, especially in the musical numbers. From the first frame to the one that says The End, i was hooked by this tale of romance filled with one of the most infectious soundtracks i have ever heard. Not since Titanic have i cried so much in a movie. The movie is cleverly edited, and a what-might-have-been sequence towards the end is just dazzling to behold. I boldly predict that this movie with its timeless theme will remain fresh for many generations to come, and become a staple for cultists everywhere.",9,3,8,22 January 2017
Les Misérables," A literary classic, a stage sensation, and now -- a screen gem
","I went into this movie quite determined to love it, if not like it as well. It's one of my favorite musicals, and the cast includes some of my favorite actors, so my bias is there. Well, i love it, and like it quite a bit too. It is a wonderful big-screen realization of a wonderful stage production. The cast does outstanding work, and the orchestration is superb as well. This film deserves Oscar nominations for acting, scoring, art direction/set decoration and costume design. I thought the editing could have been somewhat tighter. And i was put off by the new song that was included in the middle of the movie, which slowed down the plot development unnecessarily. In fact, i wished instead of the new song, the more enjoyable Little People number could have been used in full. Stand-out song performances included Anne Hathaway (I Dreamed a Dream), Russell Crowe (Stars), Hugh Jackman (Who Am I?), Eddie Redmayne (Empty Chairs and Empty Tables) and Daniel Huttlestone (Look Down). Those who are not familiar with the story may wish to check out the non-musical Les Miserables with Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush first, before catching this musical version.",8,6,9,25 December 2012
It Chapter Two," It Chapter Two needs more than just brilliant Bill Skarsgard
","Bill Skarsgard, who was brilliant as Pennywise the dancing clown in It, reprises the role in the sequel. Although the character is nonsensical, Skarsgard has fun with it and he is fun to watch. Other than Skarsgard, i can't think of any other reason why i would even bother to go see this movie. The story itself is rubbish and, at three hours long, is two and a half hours too long; the half hour worth watching are those scenes with Skarsgard's Pennywise. This is not to discredit the cast of veteran actors and their younger counterparts who all show their acting chops as well, but the material they had to work with was trying too hard to be compelling and engaging and ending up neither one nor the other. This movie may be better than the recent Scary Stories, but that's not saying much.",4,2,3,9 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," A so-called comedy that is not worth hailing
","I love the Hollywood movies from the 1940s and 1950s, so i was really looking forward to seeing this Coen brothers' effort. Sadly, i was extremely let down by a movie that had no charm, not wit and no humor. I enjoyed many earlier Coen brothers' movies including Raising Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy, Intolerable Cruelty and Burn After Reading, so maybe i had high expectations. This one was however dismally trite. The only actor who provided a bright spark was Channing Tatum. Unlike the classics from that period, Hail, Caesar! will not stand the test of time.",3,1,3,1 February 2018
Sherlock Holmes," Meet the great Sherlock, warts and all
","I've always enjoyed Sherlock Holmes on film, and this is surely one of the most competently-made versions ever. Hats off to Guy Ritchie, who gives us a Sherlock Holmes that is quite different from previous versions, yet still faithful to the original idea. I never thought i'd like a movie by Guy Ritchie this much, but this one is SUPERB in every way! Robert Downey's amazing performance makes him my Best Actor of 2009, and Jude Law's Dr Watson is most endearing. Mark Strong gives us a wonderfully diabolical villain that makes Avatar's Col Quaritch merely cartoony. The script is also very witty and the plot believable, two essential qualities if a Sherlock Holmes movie is to be credible. There is much wit to be found in the music score as well. The art direction and set decoration for this movie's Victorian London are also more visually impressive than the efforts made for Avatar's planet Pandora. One viewing of Sherlock Holmes is definitely not enough, because there is just so much to take in.",8,5,14,24 December 2009
The Conjuring," 40 years after The Exorcist, here's a new classic
","Like The Exorcist made 40 years earlier, this feature is based on a true story, taken from the case files of husband-and-wife paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. Although the set up is familiar enough, the execution and delivery are solid and assured in the capable hands of director James Wan. The screenplay nicely balances the drama and suspense, and unlike many other offerings in this genre, has hardly any gaps in logic. The acting is superlative; Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor are especially affecting as the wives/mothers particularly vulnerable to the proceedings. There are horror movies like Jeepers Creepers that just aim to scare and succeed in that department. The Conjuring, on the other hand, is not just about being scary but leaves the viewer gasping because what took place really happened and can happen to anyone. Let this therefore be a cautionary tale as well.",8,0,2,4 August 2013
Casino Royale," Is this the beginning of the end for Bond?
","Welcome to the new James Bond, who enters the franchise through the first book of the adventures of the British superspy by Ian Fleming. Sadly, that's about as exciting as it gets. The filmmakers seem to be trying to reinvent Bond according to the Jason Bourne mold, which is fine. Except they left out the fun aspect of the earlier Bonds, while the pace here is not as consistently thrilling as what you get in the Bourne series. I miss Goldfinger, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and The Spy Who Loved Me, and Die Another Day, and even The Living Daylights. I miss the Bond girls with charisma like Ursula and Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg and Jill St John and Jane Seymour and Barbara Bach, to name some. I miss the larger-than-life villains, and i even miss Q and Moneypenny. Thank goodness Dame Judi is still around to save the day as M. Daniel Craig is a potentially good Bond, but he needs better material to work with. The story here is lame, and it's not helped by the lack of more memorable characters to make up the fun factor at least. In the Jason Bourne series, the villains are low-key too, but at least the movies pulsate with gripping action. Here, the action sequences come in spurts, and there are more witty one-liners from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie than one would find here. Sorry for having to make comparisons like this, but i am just trying to comment within the context of the movie's genre. While one does not wish for more of the same done-to-death formula exhibited by some of the earlier Bonds, the next Bond movie with Daniel Craig again needs to have better plot and character development, with the former being more involving and the latter being more engaging. Otherwise, this new start may just spell the beginning of the end for this lucrative franchise.",6,16,30,17 November 2006
Cloud Atlas," An amazing, astounding and astonishing Atlas
","The Wachowskis have once again come out with a mystical masterpiece, co-written and co-directed by Tom Tykwer. Cloud Atlas interweaves several stories set in different times and locations, but which turn out to be linked. It is a breathtaking experience to watch what starts out as unrelated narratives being introduced one after the other, and their respective plots then taking turns being unveiled layer by layer. This device has been employed on film before, but Cloud Atlas' intricate editing really takes the cake. Adding to the fun are the actors playing very diverse characters in the different stories. The movie is a visual delight and despite its three-hour running time, one feels the length is justified.",7,1,2,29 January 2013
Sully," A timeless story of humanity pulling together
","Sully is a timely movie. Watching it makes one feel proud to be part of humanity and, on the eve of September 11, relieved to know that not all planes flying in the vicinity of New York's skyscrapers have evil intentions behind them. Here is a true story about a passenger airliner in trouble, the pilot delivers an improbable landing on water that resulted in no fatalities. The air crew and passengers are cooperative and live to tell their miraculous near- death escapade. The air traffic controllers tried everything they could to avert any disaster. The first responders were quick on the scene and so efficient that the rescue mission was completed under an hour. And happily, no politician tried to claim credit or steal the thunder from these true heroes. Tom Hanks is solid as always, this time as the calm, composed, almost unassuming pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger. It may not be a showy role but Hanks nails every moment, from that of making firm split-second decisions to those of quiet thoughtful ones. Director Clint Eastwood takes us behind the scenes of this real-life drama, from what was happening within the plane to the interrogation of the pilot and co-pilot by officials, providing moments of tension throughout the movie. Even if this story is familiar to the viewer, it is still great to be reminded of how wonderful it feels when everyone involved plays his part and does the right thing. Thanks, Mr Eastwood, for a movie that is not only timely, but timeless.",8,1,5,8 September 2016
