First Man," Cinematography on POINT
","A well-known story told in a way that still manages to create major moments of tension alternated with subtle scenes of sorrow, conflict but also laughter.The cinematography within this movies was phenomenal. It manages to create just the right amount of panic, confusion, control and excitement. It never gets tedious with its shot selection and keeps finding new ways to express moments of certain emotion.Ryan Gosling delivers a stunning, claustrophobic but subtle performance...... of course as expected!A close friend reviewed this movie with the caption '15 minutes in and it already captured my childhood dreams and grown-up fears' and I can't agree more. The stories about space exploration, NASA and heroes such like Neil Armstrong have always been one of my major interests and biggest dreams. It delivers perfectly by giving me these moments of pure joy, excitement and rushes of adrenaline.Personally I would give this movie a 5 out of 5, but critically it would be a 4.5 out of 5.",9,1,4,5 November 2018
