50 First Dates," Slow start, wonderful ending
","Let me start this review by admitting that Adam Sandler is at the bottom of my 'funny people'-list. The guy just doesn't do anything for me. I don't think he's funny at all. I think Drew Barrymore is absolutely hilarious though and she carries every single movie she makes.The first ten minutes of the movie are awful. Every cliché in the books passes us and Adam Sandler is simply horrible. After the first ten minutes something changes though. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe I learned to appreciate the humor or maybe the movie got funnier, I don't know, but...what a great movie it is.I won't bore you with the story of the movie, but this is it in a nutshell: Henry (Adam Sandler) meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a diner and the two really connect. The next day she doesn't remember him though and Henry finds out that due to a car accident, Lucy suffers from short memory loss. Meaning that everyday she wakes up under the impression that it's still the day of the car accident. She does the same thing every day, over and over again, not remembering what she did the day before. Henry believes Lucy is worth fighting for and every single day he manages to make Lucy fall in love with him. He hopes one day she will wake up and remember him. This of course never happens. He stays true to her though and the two get married and have a daughter.What surprised me about the movie is that it's definitely not just a comedy. Sure, it's funny at points and even hilarious sometimes (Like ten-second Tom for example), but...it's just very romantic. There's just something deep behind the whole idea of 'falling in love with someone over and over again'. This movie deals with that in the literal sense and there's just something beautiful about that.Conclusion: Drew Barrymore shines as always in this movie that goes a little deeper than your average romantic comedy. And Adam Sandler? He's not all that bad.I give this movie 8/10 stars. I loved it.",Null,36,47,6 May 2005
Finding Neverland," Beautiful movie, brilliant acting. Simply Magical!
","I'm a 16-year-old teenage girl and I suppose most other girls (or guys for that matter) won't enjoy this movie as much as I did. My two friends that I came with proved that, since they kept sighing and saying 'Oh my God...' throughout the entire movie. However, this is one of the most wonderful movies I've ever seen.It's a movie with a heart that just makes you smile. Not because it's a funny movie, but it's just a very sweet and magical movie. You feel like you're in James Barrie's mind and that's very interesting, since everything is in one way or another fairytale-like to him. James truly was Peter Pan and this movie showed that over and over again. He was still a little boy and it's wonderful to see how he expressed that. His relationship with the Davies family was so extraordinary to see and I loved every single second of it.Let's not forget the brilliant acting. I didn't expect otherwise from Johnny Depp, since he's my favorite actor of all times and he convinced me once again that he deserves to be called 'the best actor of all times' by me. Kate Winslet pleasantly surprised me. I always thought she was a great actress, but I never really enjoyed any of her movies. Now I had the chance to see what a great actress she is and I loved how she played her character and her commitment to her family. The children are all played by very talented kids and especially little Michael made me laugh, although I believe all three of them have something special. Like the boy that played little Peter. He was amazing.I think every adult (and probably some teenagers too) will enjoy this movie and it might remind them of the little child inside of them. I give this move 9 out of 10 stars. I loved every single second!",Null,5,6,10 February 2005
The Notebook," Absolutely amazing
","If the clichés 'love at first sight' and 'true love', don't mean anything to you, don't even bother watching this movie. You'll probably be bored out of your mind and find this movie truly ridiculous. However, for the true believers among us, this movie might be one of the best ever seen.Sure, the story is sweeter than sweet. We're talking mountains of cotton candy and care bears as far as you can see-sweet here. It's a beautiful story though that will captivate you from the very first second and will bring a smile on your face that's not going to be easy to wipe off.The movie is about a summer love between two 17 year olds. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) lives in a small town with his father. Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) is a poor, little rich girl as some would say, from the city. Her relationship with her parents is far from good, but she seems to be happy. She spends the summer in a small town. Yes, that's right: the same small town Noah lives in. They first meet at the carnival. The second Noah laid eyes on Allie, he knew he had to have her, so he did everything he could to accomplish that. Of course they fall in love and although their love is an improbable one, the two really appear to be a match made in heaven. Allie's parents however, do not approve. They think she can do so much better than a lowlife who makes barely 40 cents an hour. This is what eventually breaks the two up. Allie is going back to the city, leaving Noah behind.Of course this is not where the movie ends. They can't seem to forget about each other, but due to unforeseen circumstances (a.k.a Allie's mom), they don't stay in contact. Allie manages to move on and after a few years she gets engaged to Lon (James Marsden). Lon is a good guy who is very much in love with Allie and Allie really seems to be in love with Lon as well. Everything seems to go well, until Allie past starts to haunt her.What will happen next? Will Allie discover that Noah is the love of her life after all or will she realize that maybe the memories between the two of them are stronger than their love ever was? Will she marry Lon or will she end up with Noah? I'm not going to give you the answer to that, but I can promise you the ending is going to be worth it!Ryan Gosling very much surprised me. I knew he was an okay actor. I've followed him ever since his appearance on 'Breaker High' and 'Young Hercules'. But I never thought he was this good. He's a great, talented young actor and I can't wait to see more of him. Same goes for Rachel McAdams. She's a wonderful actress.Last but not least: in this movie I saw something I hadn't seen in quite a while. Not really anyway: On screen chemistry between the two main characters! Ryan and Rachel's chemistry is undeniable and part of this movie's charm.I give this movie 10/10. Why? It's simply perfect for a sucker for romance as myself!",Null,0,0,19 April 2005
Edward Scissorhands," Weird, but so incredibly good!
","I think that pretty much sums it up. The movie is without a doubt one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen, since it's about a guy with scissors for hands, but at the same time it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's an extraordinary, timeless movie and it surprised me in so many ways.Johnny Depp is simply brilliant as Edward. His clumsiness, his facial expressions, the way he moves...everything was just brilliant. No one could have done it better, I'm sure of that.I think Edward Scissorhands will always be one of my favorite movies...at least in my top 5. It's a strange, but wonderful movie!",Null,0,3,24 December 2004
The Terminal," An absolute masterpiece
","This movie really is an absolute masterpiece. With Steven Spielberg directing it and 'big' actors as Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones starring in it, I hadn't expected otherwise, yet I was still very much impressed by the movie. Tom Hanks plays a guy from an East-European, fictional country, who hardly speaks any English. It's unbelievable how convincing and with how much charm he presents the part, which made me instantly love the movie.The story itself is of course brilliant. It follows a guy who hardly knows the difference between yes and no in English, around JFK airport, because he's stuck there since his country has gone to war and technically no longer exists. Victor Navorski's clumsiness, but irresistible charm and inventive nature, combine both humor and drama into this amazing film. Add Catherine Zeta-Jones as a possible love interest for Victor and the film is complete.Without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in quite a while, not in the last place because of Tom Hank's brilliant acting. 9/10",Null,8,17,23 January 2005
A Walk to Remember," A movie with a heart.
","A walk to remember is a movie based on the book by Nicholas Sparks. However, I didn't know that when I first watched the movie, so I never compared the movie with the book, which might be a good thing. Not because the movie is bad or the book is bad, but because they are both very different and comparing the two would do injustice to both the film and the book.The movie stars Mandy Moore as the sweet, religious daughter of the minister with a horrible sense of style (she only owns one sweater), but a heart of gold; Jamie Sullivan. Shane West plays Landon Carter, the dark, mysterious bad boy whose life revolves around his own popularity and group of followers. Two people that have absolutely nothing in common. However, fate brings them together when Landon is forced to participate in the spring play, which means working closely together with Jamie. Things change from that moment on. Landon changes from that moment on.'A walk to remember' is simply a beautiful movie that shows an impossible love-story between a boy and a girl that are so different, but so alike at the same time. They manage to make their impossible love possible, only to learn that their love-story will inevitably come to an end. Like I said before: this is a movie with a heart. It's an emotional movie that will make you think about certain things you've probably never thought about before.The movie isn't flawless. No movie is. However, I was willing to look beyond those flaws and what I saw was the sweetest, most beautiful movie I've ever seen. The chemistry between Mandy Moore and Shane West is undeniable and both of them have done a really great job on this movie. They were better than I expected.To me, this is my favorite movie of all times. I love every bit of it and I can watch it over and over again. The movie always brings me to tears and hopefully that will never change.Conclusion: If you have a heart and you enjoy love-stories with a not-so-happy ending, then you will like, probably love, this movie. It's great. Give it a chance.10/10",Null,3,4,9 March 2005
