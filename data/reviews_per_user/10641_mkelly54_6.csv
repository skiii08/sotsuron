The Monuments Men," Not your average war movie
","This is one of the most rare war movies I've seen. I read Robert M. Edsel's book with the same title, so I was anxious to see the story on the screen. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't disappointed. Just think, in the hell of WWII the President of the United States assigns a group of artists, art restorers, architects and a sculptor to save as much of the art stolen by Hitler throughout Europe. No small task, to be sure. What George Clooney (writer, director, producer, actor) produced is a series of vignettes with team members seeking the stolen pieces and working to recover them, much like 'The Longest Day' and 'A Bridge Too Far' adaptations of Cornelius Ryan's non-fiction works with the same titles were produced as vignettes of various characters. While the film does not focus on firefights, tactics and strategy, it does focus on the detailed search for Western Europe's most prized possessions, it's art. The story also provides insights into the friendships, humor and struggles encountered throughout The Monuments Men's pursuit of stolen art. The acting is good to great, and the script, though scattered with vignettes, is solid. Some viewers may not connect with the stoic nature of the personalities. I can attest to its authenticity as my father served in the war and always maintained a quiet demeanor while describing his experiences  even when there was humor to his tales, it was delivered in an understated manner. And many of his veteran friends had similar persona.The story also provides a glimpse at the approaching Cold War with the Soviet Union, with a team from Russians seeking the same artistic treasures, with Clooney and Company scoring one for the good guys near the end of the movie. Again, this isn't your average war movie. It's better; with a true story on one of the most under appreciated and unknown aspects of the European Theatre.",Null,3,6,10 February 2014
The English Patient," A Devotion to the Emotions, Tragedy and Turbulence of World War II.
","The most impressive aspect of The English Patient is its devotion to the emotions, turbulence and tragedy of the time, World War II. With the world turned upside down by a war and the end of Europe's royal class, viewers are taken on a visually stunning journey of love, betrayal, constant loss and the ever-so-slow passing of the central character, Count Laszlo de Almasy, brilliantly played by Ralph Fiennes. Many reviewers term this a 'reader's movie,' and so it is. It's also a movie of the visual and musical arts, with scenes throughout the work stretching the bounds of fixed concepts. I often listen to the soundtrack by Gabriel Yared, with wide swaths of themes reveling in the adventures of archeologists in the Sahara and discoveries of Italian monastic art. Countering the classic themes are popular jazz and big band pieces from the 1930s and 40s, with de Almasy renowned for knowing the lyrics to every piece from the era. The characters throughout the story are classic, which weaves an enduring tableau of emotions, memories and the realization that as much as many view each era as different, there is always a sense of the retelling of stories, best stated with Casablanca's song, As Time Goes By. Lastly, there's a simple reason The English Patient earned nine Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Anthony Minghella: It's one of the best movies of all time.

The Book Thief," An Understated Classic
","No extended fight scenes. No unnecessary pyrotechnics. Simply a story of ordinary people conducting themselves in extraordinary fashion when faced with the hell of Hitler's Third Reich and World War II. The literary vehicle of Death as the Narrator is a masterstroke, as is the overall emphasis of words/books/art overcoming evil. And it's all done with compassion for children at their best and most vulnerable, and adults bypassing the convention of the era to display kindness, caring and understanding.An understated classic, there aren't enough movies like this being produced.And that's a damn shame.",10,301,359,28 November 2013
Interstellar," Perfect example of filming making at its best!!
","This is what I'm always looking for in a movie: amazing and thought-provoking script, finely detailed and imaginative cinematography and CGI, inspired and believable acting and a soundtrack (Hans Zimmer) that connects viewers with the story, adding tension, passion, soul scouring drama and pause through well crafted music. Unlike many science fiction movies, Interstellar goes the extra light year to bring home the themes of family, loss, unfathomable exploration and dimensions beyond our scope of reality.Leave everything at home and experience this tremendous work of art! Hell, make it a holiday present to yourself and everyone you know. I know there are a lot of excellent movies that will be released between now and the end of the year, but this is an absolute must see!",10,9,19,18 November 2014
The Waterboy," Classic Comedy/Football Farce
","It's obvious many people think too much of their film critic credentials, and they miss the overall point of 'The Waterboy': There isn't a shred of 'serious' to the story, simply a spoof of all things related to big time college football, the deep South and over-bearing mothers. To see it as anything else is to lose grasp on the human comedy. Much like folks misunderstanding the camp nature of 'Starship Troopers,' 'The Waterboy' is a classic in its own right, with a flip of the finger to anyone who doesn't comprehend the intentions of the production. In fact, if they don't understand, they should take mama's place in the hospital bed!",8,1,1,6 December 2013
Amélie," Perfectly perfect in every way
","I originally saw this movie when it was released in the States five years ago, and I watch my DVD version from time to time. The only thing I can add to the other submissions is that American screen writers need to learn more from this director and his writers.There is a real sense of whimsical creativity here that is touched on in A Very Long Engagement, even though it is a story of war time horror and rebirth.However, like one other writer mentioned, Amelie is a creation of the human comedy. While many folks always take the blue path in life, there is much comedy even in the darkest hours.In fact, when I originally saw Amelie, I was in a dark mood following the death of my 9 year old son after a two year battle with leukemia ... and Amelie set me on the road to recovery ... especially by allowing me to pull great practical jokes again.Afterall, what is life without practical jokes?",10,3,8,4 July 2006
