The Blair Witch Project," We want a sequel!
","My friend and I saw The Blair Witch Project the night it opened. I admit that I'm a wuss and could barely WATCH the last 10 minutes of the movie, but my friend wants a sequel. There's nothing 'new' to the movie that can't be found on the website, with perhaps the slight exception of a certain discovery in the woods.There has to be a sequel -- this is only half of the movie. It doesn't answer any questions, it only raises them. And there are plenty of questions to be answered in the future.Should there be a second movie, my advice is to STOP JERKING THE  CAMERA AROUND. It makes people motion sick, and had I had the courage to watch during the scary bits, I might have been among those who got ill. Yes, it's a nice effect, but it gets old.Ideally, TBWP should be viewed in a remote town so that you pass by woods on the way home. Seeing it in a city doesn't have the same effect.",8,1,1,30 July 1999
