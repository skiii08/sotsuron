Raiders of the Lost Ark," A look back at a forgotten genre
","The adventure genre, often used, but truly destined for only a few films out there. Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, is one of these films. The 1981 classic captures your cravings for adventure that you haven't had since you were a young boy or girl. It plays into imagination in a way that no movies succeed in today. Harrison Ford plays a timeless character, which is even more scruffy looking and bad-ass than his previous iconic role as Han solo. Beyond the dusty surface of Raiders, lays a deeply genius film. Embedded with great shots and wonderful techniques used in film making. Still very enjoyable today, Raiders truly stood the test of time.",7,0,1,30 November 2017
