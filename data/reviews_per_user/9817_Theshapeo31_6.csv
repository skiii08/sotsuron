Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," WORST Star Wars movie
","This is the WORST Star Wars movie I've ever seenJust because I have a disdain for this movie doesn't mean I'm one of those people who hate the Star Wars prequels. The reason why I hate this movie is because this is one of the most boring films I've seen to date. Is it the worst movie ever made? No but in my opinion it's one of them. Now one reason why people hate the Star Wars prequels is because in the original films (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, & Return of The Jedi) it was all about war, rebellion, & trying to bring peace & freedom to the galaxy yet here in the prequel films (Phantom Menace, Attack of The Clones, & Revenge of The Sith) it's about taxations, trade routes, & politics where if anyone wanted to watch that they'd just tune in to fox news, CNN, NBC, ms-NBC or any channel of the topic. The main problem with this film is that there is no character development and this is supposed the most important of the trilogy films because you want to pull your audience that was born in between the 60's & 80's back in along with a new generation and they succeeded to a certain extent. The characters missing development that needed it would be Obi-Wan Kenobi (my favorite character in the prequel trilogy) despite that in my opinion that Ewan McGregor is the perfect choice for the role but he's underdeveloped and does nothing until the last 20 minutes in his battle alongside Qui-Gon & Darth Maul and speaking of those 2 characters they had the same problem they're both cool but are completely useless and serve no purpose, they don't do anything to advance the story of the prequel trilogy but only advance the plot of this one movie.The character of Anakin (who would've of course become Darth Vader) doesn't get Todd character development and when he shouts 'YIPPIE' you just want to take a gun and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger. Also his pod race scene which is 10 minutes of boring stacked on boring stacked on boring stacked on boring stacked on boring and that 10 minutes felt like my first day of Junior High School. The only things I find redeemable about this movie is: The Dual of Fates score, the character of Darth Maul a cool Sith Lord who can hold his own against 2 Jedi and of course his battle against Obi-Wan & Qui-Gon. Also I forget to mention Jar Jar Binks. Everyone hates the character but I honestly didn't mind him, I'm not saying I liked him but to me he wasn't there. This whole movie is just one big mess that I give a 5.5/10",3,5,10,12 August 2012
Skyfall," Overrated... But does me saying that mean its bad? Read to see
","I've been a fan of the James Bond franchise since I was 7 so 10 years I've been a fan with the first I've seen being Die Another Day (which ironically is one of the worst). When I heard about Skyfall this year in May, I couldn't wait for it and got excited to a new Bond movie on the big screen. However lately this movie has been getting a lot of praise as 'the best Bond movie ever', 5 Star ratings & considering how bad the last Bond movie was (Quantum of Solace) I had high expectations.After watching this movie opening weekend I confess myself to be disappointed. But with me saying that does it mean it's bad, not necessarily because most of the time that is the case but this is one of few exceptions. I do like this movie but it's overrated for all of the buzz it's been getting: Daniel Craig on Saturday Night Live, various T.V. Commercials, & 3 minute long trailers and disappointing because it's not the best Bond movie and doesn't live fully to expectations. I was ready to say this is the best Bond movie or in my Top 5 Bond movies but overall this scores 9th place. The basic plot of the movie is James Bond after being accidentally shot by his partner is presumed dead but really he's been living on some undisclosed island for 3 months and has come back to help after seeing terrorist attacks on MI6 Headquarters. But at first he doesn't get to help because after being M.I.A. for 3 months he has to go through his tests again testing his stamina, accuracy, & physical strength which he fails scoring a 40. So th movie is focusing on James Bond having been out of action for 3 months: is he rusty? Can he still get the job done? Has he lost his touch? Our Bond villain Roaul Silva (portrayed by Javier Bardem) isn't all really interesting, he has his cool moments every now and then but doesn't stand out as a Bond villain. Even when we learn who he is and his intentions (a former MI6 agent under M's command who was captured and tortured by the Chinese who wants revenge on M and his main goal is to kill her). Hes just one of the lesser villains he's no Dr. No, or Blofeld or Goldfinger. Also when we first meet him he comes off as a homosexual in a homo-erotic scene with Bond. I said in the Beginning that this movie is overrated and it is, this isn't the best Bond movie ever Goldfinger still holds on to that honor and overall this is Daniel Craig's best performance as James Bond but this isn't a better Bond movie than Casino Royale but it's almost on Par with it. This movie does have its share or pros such as: the return of the Aston-Martin (the car from Goldfinger with machine guns on it), Javier Bardem's performance (while his character was bland and uninteresting he does a good job in the role). Also the story of Bond trying to get back into action is interesting but could've been executed and written better. But me saying this movie is overrated doesn't mean it's bad, it's a pretty good and fairly solid but in the James Bond franchise it takes the 9th best prize and overall is the 5th best movie I've seen this year and I'd rate this a 7.5 or at best an 8 or at least a 7. It's up to you whether you want to see it or not but I'll admit at some parts I was bored but overall it was worth the matin√©e price of admission I paid.",8,1,4,15 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Now I know how people who hate The Star Wars prequels feel.....
","I give this movie *1/2 Stars Out of *****OK I'm 17 and I grew up with the original Spider-Man trilogy with Toby McGuire in the role of Spider-Man, along with my parents who were big Spider-Man fans growing up and my dad had the comics and I read them and I know that this is more based off the comics than any movie in the original trilogy and is more realistic but that doesn't save the movie.On to the review, I was looking forward to this movie for a while from the time I heard about a reboot I was excited and on my birthday I saw it in theaters and what I saw was FAR from satisfying. Now I knew that Andrew Garfield wouldn't be able to touch Toby as Spider-Man but I didn't expect him to be that bad. Now the story is Peter Parker is being dropped off at his aunt & uncle while his parents go off, fast forward into the future he's in high school, he's picked on like in the original trilogy and all of that, he's in love with Gwen Stacy (who was his first girlfriend in the comics) rather than Mary Jane. He sneaks into Oscorp. To see her and is bitten buy the genetically enhanced spider and gets his powers and fights crime in the city and later Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. That's basically the plot of the movie and here are the problems I have with it.Now the acting in this movie isn't bad at all or being close to it. To me the highlight actor of the movie would be Rhys Ifans (Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard) when you see his conversation with Peter you believe he's just an underachieving scientist who wants to learn more about reptiles, to learn their secrets on regeneration and find a way to give that same ability to humans so he tries on himself but it goes awry. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy: I love seeing on-screen not just because she's beautiful but because that Emma Stone is a good actress I loved her in flicks like: Zombieland, Superbad, & Easy A & I thought she funny when she hosted Saturday Night Live and this movie was no exception I LOVED her performance as Gwen Stacy. Martin Sheen & Sally Field as his aunt & uncle were great parental figures to Peter (especially Martin Sheen, however I didn't hear 'with great power comes great responsibility'). And last and may possibly be least is the man behind the mask Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man: now as Peter despite that I liked Toby better because I grew up with him in the role, & he showed a little bit more emotion than Andrew I still think that he was almost on par with Toby as Peter but as Spider-Man I HATED him (despite the few occasional funny moments) his costume was horrible, he looked like he was CGI at times, & he couldn't shoot his own webs. Now I know that this is more based off the comics and more realistic but I thought it was cooler that Toby could shoot webs by himself and not a power glove like web shooter, and his inhuman strength was amped to over the top as scene in the bathroom scene & when he got his powers Andrew just seemed like he already knew he had powers, what to do with them & as if he wasn't surprised, Toby seemed like he was freaked out by his powers and took him sometime to get used to them. The action scenes weren't much to me to at all, in the original his fights with the Green Goblin were fun to watch, in Spider-Man 2 his fight with Doc. Oct was spectacular & in Spider-Man 3 his fights with Harry, Venom & Sandman all of those fights were great but his fight with The Lizard was just boring. Well despite the few occasional funny moments & the very keen acting for a superhero movie this is the worst movie I've seen all year. Is it the worst superhero movie? No, I still think that The Hulk of 2003 holds that prize but this is a definite second.",3,2,5,12 August 2012
The Bourne Legacy," You'll miss Damon but Jeremy barely pulls out a good job
","I'd give this *** 1/4 Out of *****Now I love the original Bourne trilogy that centers around Jason Bourne and when I heard that this wasn't going to have Matt Damon in the role I thought it wasn't going to be good but however after seeing that Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye in The Avengers) will be in the lead role and that brighten my mood but I still thought he couldn't save the movie & I ended up eating my words along with my popcorn. But I should point out that if your a fan of the Jason Bourne character I hope you'll be happy with just hearing his name & seeing a couple of his pictures because he's not in this movie. I also should point out that this movies story is a lot more complicated to understand than that of Jason Bourne because like I said he's not in this movie and it focuses on Aaron Cross or Agent Outcome #5. Now the plot in a nutshell about this movie is Outcome #5 is like Jason Bourne he was a test experiment and with that being said he has the same inhuman qualities and advanced fighting skills as Jason Bourne and he shows that a few times (and it doesn't disappoint) but he need green pills to keep himself stabilized so he saves Marta Shearing (Rachel wieitz) an Outcome scientist who was meant to be killed by the CIA who has killed every Outcome Agent & Scientist (except Aaron Cross, herself, & Jason Bourne) so he convinces her he's on her side and he'll protect her of she helps him. So they go to Manilla where we learn his real name is Kenneth¬†James Keitsom a private who was seemingly killed in the Iraq war. So she injects when the drugs he needs and is cured but keeps his enhanced physical abilities and they're pursued by LARX-03 an assassin then in Matrix: Reloaded like chase scene that was very entertaining and kept my attention they get away from him, seemingly knocked him out, and escape via a boat to parts unknown ending the movie. Now like I said this story is very hard to understand and it wasn't until about an hour and a half until I understood everything (that I will say was boring and almost had me asleep) they jumped 5 gears and satisfied me. The ending does make you angry because your expecting more but if we get a sequel we'll see it. Is this movie of the year? No but it's FAR from being the worst.",7,2,7,12 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Improvement over the Previous Installment....But not much...
","I've been a fan of Spider-Man since I was a kid, watching the animated series and eventually Sam Raimi's trilogy. I was excited for a new movie in 2012, then I saw it and it sucked HARD. This movie is improvement but not much, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a perfect example of Hollywoods false advertising. The trailers of this movie were packed with action scenes of Spider-Man fighting Electro, Rhino, scuffles of Peter and Harry Osbourne (also that one scene in the trailers were Peter said Oscorp has had Peter under surveillance isn't in the movie at all.....). There really isn't much action in the movie really only 2 or 3 fight scenes as the movie is primarily about the relationship of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy which isn't too bad and is actually pretty good (Emma Stone was really the only thing I liked about the 1st film, and she's no exception to being good here). Really the only good things in the movie: 1. Gwen Stacy & Peter Parker's relationship 2. Jamie Foxx as Electro 3. Electro vs. Spider-Man (Round 2) and that's about itCons of TASM2 1. Dane Dahaad as Harry Osbourne (over the top and unbelievable) 2. Green Goblin and Rhino (both were pretty pointless, The Green Goblin shows up RIGHT at the end JUST to kill Gwen Stacy than gets knocked out before she dies, and Rhino just had no business being in the movie at all). 3. The ending (The movie should've ended with Peter at Gwen's grave and consider retiring from hero work)The movie I can't really explain in full detail with 1,000 characters but you should get the point. The movie is improvement but not much I still prefer Sam Raimi's trilogy (even the underrated Spider-Man 3) over Marc Webb's trilogy. The ending really hurt the movie, it would've been better off ending at Gwen's funeral and Peter contemplating his life as a superhero and the end credits could've been something that foreshadows Venom or the Sinister Six as the next villains of the sequel.",5,3,10,16 May 2014
Psycho," Rarely any horror film in my opinion as ever toped this
","There have only been a small handful of horror films (in my option) to have toped Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' (The Shining & Halloween I & II). Well what can I say about this timeless classic? Nothing really but I'll try. But first I HAVE to start off by saying that Alfred Hitchcock truly is the master of suspense and this truly is his masterpiece and he has had MANY great films and a handful of them have made Damian's Top 250 Movies of All-Time (The Birds, Vertigo, & Rear Window to name a few). But anyway there's nothing I can really think of to say about this film so I'll have to go into the story which EVERYONE knows.The story starts off with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend waking up after an afternoon of sex. Then she goes to work and has to drop off $40,000 at the bank (also with inflammation that's A lot of cash almost or about $250,000 in America's currency). But she decides to runaway with it and stops for the night at Bates Motel where she meets nervous but the seemingly gentle Norman Bates who keeps her company and has dinner with her and gives his famous 'A boys best friend is his mother speech'. Then after that we ALL knows what happens next Marion goes to take a shower and the famous 'shower scene' happens (and I could imagine how it was for people in theatres). So after she's killed by what was seemingly Norman's mother Norman finds her dead body and cleans up the bathroom and puts her body into her car and pushes it into quicksand. So then the second half of the film is basically Marion's sister, boyfriends & detective Abergast trying to find her but he's killed and the. They find that Norman's mother is skeleton and the one that's supposedly 'Norman's Mother' is Norman himself!!!! So they apprehend him and Norman is taken away and the film ends there.Now like I said Alfred Hitchcock (may he rest in peace) truly is the master of suspense and this really is his masterpiece and my favorite of all of his films. The acting in this movie is amazing Janet Leigh (mother of successful actress Jamie Lee Curtis who would star in the John Carpenter classic masterpiece 'Halloween' that was heavily influenced by 'Psycho') was excellent as Marion Crane, but the real star of the film is the late and great Anthony Perkins (who tragically died of AIDS may he rest along with Mr. Hitchcock) who portrayed Norman Bates PERFECTLY he really seemed like a nervous, shy man who was afraid of his own shadow he played the part down to the T (hell of a lot better than Vince Vaughn in the remake that shall not be spoken of). Hitchcock's brilliant writing and directing has made this one of the greatest films I've ever seen to date and on Damian's Top 250 Films of All-Time this ranks at #29. This film really is amazing. I've only seen this a few times and the VERY first time I saw it the suspense just had me glued to the film and I couldn't look away again and I have to say one more time: bravo Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins may you both rest in peace. ***** Out of ***** Stars",10,0,0,13 August 2012
