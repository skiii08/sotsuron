The Ring," Thrilling & Chilling
","I absolutely loved the movie.  I found the first few minutes hard to bear, but keep watching and you will love it.  A few scenes really made me jump. Not your scream out loud horror show but definitely worth your time to watch.  I give it a 9 on a scale of 1-10.",Null,0,0,6 March 2003
The Mummy Returns," Excellent--better than the first!
","I thought 'The Mummy' was excellent but without question 'The Mummy Returns' is clearly better.  Rarely will a sequel outdo the original but with 'The Mummy Returns' the job is done.  Great plot, acting, and action.  This is one movie you will want to watch again and again.",10,0,0,16 November 2001
Tombstone," A truly GREAT western!!!!
","Tombstone is a movie that doesn't disappoint.  When I first heard about this movie, I was very sceptical.  I just couldn't see Kurt Russell or Val Kilmer as cowboys.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday is absolutely spectacular.  Watching his character is chilling. Kurt Russell is very believable as Wyatt Earp.  All the characters are very likable.  This is a must-see western.  John Wayne would have been proud!",9,0,0,5 March 2003
