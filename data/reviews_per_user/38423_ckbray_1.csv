Hereditary," A New Definition for a Horror (Horrible) Film
","This movie was incredibly s-l-o-o-o-o-o-w!!! Followed by several minutes of gruesome. No redeeming qualities at all. And there you have it. Don't was your money, go see something else.All the good reviews have to be from the cast and crew.",1,82,164,18 June 2018
