Whip It," So much better than the plot description
","I had no intention of watching this at first because it looked like a typical 'girl from nowhere becomes big star' type of film.And roller blading? Really?I guess singing, dancing and erm, dancing on tables have finally been deemed 'done' (guess someone forgot to tell Ms. Aguilera...!) The actual plot itself is clichéd at times but when it is, it's still executed extremely well.One thing I noticed (interestingly) is that this is possibly the first time I have watched a chick flick where none of the jokes fall flat...really.In fact, I even laughed out loud - really hard - quite a few times.I ultimately decided to watch it because I am a huge fan of Juliette Lewis and have never seen her in anything bad, I typically enjoy all of Drew Barrymore's films (even the ones that aren't exactly classics) and Ellen Page is someone who's star is rising so I couldn't imagine she would sign on for a bad script at this point in her career.There are only a couple of moments where the script becomes a little obvious but clearly with this genre of film, a couple of hokey lines here and there are acceptable.I enjoyed the film mainly because it is hugely and consistently entertaining throughout, it genuinely had my adrenaline going during the inevitable 'big game' and the lead doesn't get everything she wants which is very refreshing (and rare in films such as these).Whilst Whip It clearly is a chick flick; it has more than enough substance for a much broader audience to enjoy - don't let the naff plot description put you off!9/10",9,0,4,17 December 2010
10 Cloverfield Lane," Stop reading reviews and go watch it
","I haven't reviewed anything for a very long time despite having watched many excellent and deserving films. I try to avoid trailers and reviews because they all too often ruin my enjoyment of films, either by giving too much away or just by increasing my expectations too much.So I'll keep it short: the first ten minutes or so were boring and had I not read a glowing review and seen the first film already, I likely would have turned the film off. It's when Howard (John Goodman) and Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) finally have a conversation that I felt engaged. Every scene from that point onwards was riveting. There's something for everyone in this film and it feels modern (i.e. Michelle doesn't do anything stupid...maybe one thing...) and there's nothing gratuitous.There aren't many films of this calibre being released so stop reading reviews and just watch it.10/10",10,1,4,13 May 2016
The Equalizer," Same old but REALLY satisfying
","I love Denzel Washington. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with some of his latest films (Safe House was a joke and Unstoppable was pretty horrific) but nevertheless they are always entertaining. I loved 2 Guns and I was really looking forward to this one; The Equalizer. It's definitely one of the better action films released in recent years.Some bad stuff: I really don't think Chloë Grace Moretz was suited for this role. Also, her relationship with Denzel was fake as hell.A lot of the film (all of it) was highly manipulative: Denzel is everybody's saviour, sad music at all the right moments (and there're a lot of them), waaay over the top slow motion usage etc.The bad guy was super cheesy although I do like the actor in other films.Good stuff: The action. The kill scenes are epic and although Denzel doesn't really pull off action scenes, it doesn't matter because they are filmed superbly. Frankly this was more of a torture-gore film than an action film once it got going.Overall, this was typical Hollywood cr*p but done REALLY well and a must watch for action/gore fans.8/10",8,1,3,13 December 2014
Iron Man 3," Excellent comic action film; watch it!
","It took me ages to watch this because of all the conflicting reviews. I thought it was going to be as bad/boring as Terminator Salvation or The Dark Knight Rises.This film was fantastic! Easily the best of the Iron Mans (although the first will always be 'the best', this one is repeat-watch-worthy).Now that I know how awesome this film is, I think the negative reviews make more sense: they seem to focus on things like 'but the bad guy isn't the same as the comic' or 'that's not believable' etc. so let's ignore those because that's just irrelevant. The film can still be good without sticking 100% to the comics! I can't believe some people complain about the realism when we're dealing with magic and flying iron man suits but okay, let's mark the film down because the hero didn't break his back quite enough in that scene?! I've given this a ten because the story progresses brilliantly, there are so many extra scenes included that you would normally expect to be edited out to keep the running time down but the fact that they're left in means the film has a well-rounded feel to it. Contrary to some opinions, I like that the woman has the chance to save the day instead of 'just' being eye-candy (Gwyneth wears the most amazing white office power-suit ever; congrats to the designer), it is a bit patronising to just have one scene of saving the day but it's better than nothing. One of the bad guys (Guy Pearce) is building a great profile for himself as being someone to watch out for as he might just steal the show! This film had it all, yes there's a cute kid, but this is Iron Man so it never gets cheesy and actually there are some hilarious scenes between Robert Downey Jr and the kid. There's loads of humour and the action is great.Everyone gets just the right amount of screen time in my opinion and I'm actually going to watch this again which is rare for me.10/10 as it's an excellent film - not perfect but excellent.",10,19,31,10 December 2013
John Wick," Kill All The Things
","Keanu Reeves always comes back with a little gem but this one is his best film in ages.It's a pure Kill Film, nothing more and nothing less. Keanu, as John Wick, has the only two things he has left in this world taken from him at a time when he has nothing left to live for and so, entirely understandably, he decides to take revenge. Keanu then proceeds to kill a significant amount of people.Here's what I liked about John Wick: clearly, whoever was in charge, really loves film and/or knows exactly how to improve upon every mediocre revenge film out there. The clichéd bits seemed almost deliberate like a teacher showing his or her film students how to make a tired and overdone scene interesting and unique.I won't expand too much on this point other than to say that there is something engaging about every scene no matter how often it has been done before.What I really want to talk about is the fight scenes. This is the first time since the Bourne films that I feel someone has done something different and unique with fight choreography. All the fights seemed to be filmed in one take and without stunt doubles. There was one extended fight scene in particular in the middle which was stunning. I genuinely can't think of another actor who would have pulled off Keanu's character and choreography as well as he did.During the inevitable 'sit-down' with the bad guy and his men, they missed an opportunity to mirror a previous scene with a 'captured' female assassin, nevertheless; Keanu gets an opportunity to really let go and bring some much needed emotion to his character. I thought he could have gone further and this could have been more poignant but he delivered the scene really well.I think it's time to officially acknowledge a new genre of film: the kill film. I wouldn't label it as action because I expect action films to include action as part of the main story not the other way around. If you want to watch a good revenge/kill film, this is definitely the one.9/10",9,26,50,14 January 2015
The Maze Runner," Worth a watch but nothing special
","This was basically a very low-key version of Divergent.I wasn't particularly impressed but it's entertaining enough so I'm just going to give a brief overview of the good and bad points.Bad points being that it literally is a low-key version of every tween film ever made - I think they spent about 5 seconds quickly pointing out all of the gangs and establishing which was the 'cool' gang. It's all about 'being chosen' and 'being special' which I think is very damaging to young children's personal development because that's not how life is. The white guy is the saviour of literally everyone. They all seem a bit too well adjusted for people who have been kidnapped, no insanity or OCD habits and ticks. As usual the monsters have this weird thing where they are extremely agile with lots of legs and extra tentacle-claws so theoretically they 'should' be able to catch and/or kill the people they're chasing fairly easily but movie logic ensures they can't. At least until the script requires it.Good points are that enough things happen to keep the viewer's attention and while it's not believable that there weren't more arguments, this actually made the film easier to watch because it's annoying when there is too much opposition. One bad guy is enough. The scary monsters were genuinely scary and I thought the twist(s) at the end were good.I'd watch a second film but this one is so unoriginal that I have to give it a 6.",6,29,57,28 November 2014
The Hunger Games," Good but not great
","I put off watching this for ages and couldn't decide because reviews were either 'it's amazing' or 'it's the worst film ever'.It's not the worst film ever.If you're a fan of the books (I haven't read any) then you'll love this no doubt. If, like me, you had never heard of this before then you will likely think the film was good but too clichÃ©d.I think if the next film has a much bigger budget and they make it more 'Transformer-ish' in terms of slickness in the production then it might be a lot more exciting.I watched it when bored and I didn't turn it off. I have seen a LOT of films though so I'm quite cynical of films that repeat what has gone before.Well worth watching but you won't rave about it if you haven't read the books.6/10",6,0,2,18 August 2013
Aquaman," Spectacular superhero film
","In a nutshell: if you're looking for an entertaining blockbuster, this is it. The world of Atlantis in particular was beautiful and I hope future films focus on this and expand a lot more on the people and sea creatures.Surprises: the acting was great from everyone and the storyline made sense (some tropes of course).The reason the film lost a star for me was that some of the writing was super lame. I understand these hero films don't want to take themselves too seriously but the acting was so good and the story so engaging that some more earnest and sincere responses would have been appreciated instead of lines like 'what a d*ck'. I also didn't like that they made Aquaman come across as a bit of a douche. This is a guy who (thought he) lost his mum as a child and has seen some horrific stuff while saving people's lives but comes across as some carefree surfer dude. I hope the next film shows him exploring Atlantis, taking on his duties and really seeing what it means to be King - perhaps also losing either his mother or wife in some tragic way so that he can grow as a person and change his character's personality in a legitimate way so that the writing can improve as well. As it stands, Aquaman is like a watered-down, less-funny version of Thor and needs his own unique personality.Minor issues which can be fixed in subsequent films. I'll definitely be watching sequels.9/10",9,1,2,2 January 2019
The Town," Good all round but the ending ruins it
","I would like to give this film 8 or 9 out of ten but unfortunately I felt the ending really let the film down.I am aware of Ben Affleck's talents as a director / storyteller so I was already expecting to be thoroughly engaged in the film and was really looking forward to watching it.The film is an excellent mixture of character driven story lines and action / romance, it builds tension and the car chase / robbery scenes are simply superb. I really couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it is actually one of those films you don't want to end because of how enjoyable it is!***Spoiler***Unfortunately though, I felt that the people responsible for putting the ending together seemed to be at loggerheads over how to do this. That is the impression I got because it ended up being a bit messy i.e. they seemed to not want to go for the happy ending or the sad one so they just kind of went 'in between'. It may work on some films but definitely not this one.Worth watching for the main experience but I cannot outright recommend a film that will likely disappoint at the end...let's hope the DVD ending is more decisive.7/10 (rounded up from 6.5)",7,0,5,3 December 2010
Interstellar," Must watch
","I watched Interstellar after completing my third re-watch of the Farscape series. As soon as talk of wormholes kicked in, I couldn't help but think of John Crichton and I felt sorry for all other Sci Fi films and TV series once Interstellar explained that they'd been depicting wormholes incorrectly all this time! In fairness, wormholes are only theoretical so I say each to their own interpretation.The film is extremely long. I actually don't mind when an excellent film is very long but I do mind when I spot lots of scenes that could easily have been edited down. One example being: do we need to watch someone climb all the way down a flight of stairs? Especially when they have no more dialogue? I would have expected more characters to have time to be developed but despite the nearly three-hour run time, I have no understanding for why Cooper's son turned out the way he did and there was barely any backstory for the majority of the main characters.Having said that, there was plenty of time to fully explore the Sci Fi aspects of the film which is what we're all really here for. I remember thinking that Interstellar is what Contact (1997) should have been as opposed to the massive anti-climax that it was. In fact, it's what Gravity (2013) should have been what with all the fuss over it. Contact was a great film but a bit before its time I'm guessing, whereas Gravity felt more like a test run before releasing Interstellar. I'm sure it wasn't, it's just that Gravity was such a bad film; nothing happened! The storyline had been done a thousand times before, only this time it was set in space. And that appalling ending!Interstellar gets so many things right. It doesn't shy away from the meaty Sci Fi stuff that people like me want to see. We actually get to see the wormhole, black hole, dimensions and planets. There's an intense atmosphere generated throughout the entire film and I was constantly in full hyper-alert mode for extended periods of time. I loved the backstory of why people on Earth were suffering because they kept it simple and believable. Occasionally, a ridiculous plot twist or explanation would trigger my 'as if' reflex but later, it would be explained so that it was no longer daft, for example; they would make an assumption which would later prove to have been wrong however, although this provides immediate relief for the part of you that's still screaming 'what?!' at the screen, it doesn't change the fact that you just spent half an hour or so silently seething about the stupidity of the plot.I enjoyed so much of this film but I do have to take a moment to acknowledge the poor casting. It's a pure Hollywood vehicle of course and one of only a handful of genuinely incredible films that have been released in the past few years so of course everyone and their best pal is going to want a piece of it. They slowly introduce new characters so it's never too much of a shock to the system when a familiar face appears but one or two were just badly miscast. Matt Damon for example, has this weird thing where at first, he is Matt Damon; same look, same voice and same mannerisms, but then something will happen and he'll end up acting everyone off the screen with his ability to make you empathise even when you shouldn't. His role here is no different. My reaction to his appearance started out as 'well, this film's ruined' and ended with 'only he could have pulled that off'.It has to be said: Matthew McConaughey needs to calm down. There are some signature mannerisms that he's taken to and it all comes across as quite egotistical. I think he accomplished something in his career that few ever have or could but I reckon a lot of his success was down to his humility and great personality which translated to people wanting to help him but the more aloof and serious he acts (literally), the more this puts me off him as an actor. No disrespect intended, but McConaughey has never changed his accent (as far as I'm aware), has never done any character acting and has essentially been playing the same character in every film for years. It seems that he's worked out that talking really slowly and keeping a serious scowl on his face for two to three hours, makes people take his performance more seriously and mistake that for 'great acting'. I would rather he went back to having an approachable demeanour and worked on his ability to transform himself than take the lazy route of just being super serious all the time. It gets old. Also, the fake tan was out of control and actually quite distracting.Once you've watched Interstellar, you'll be Googling things like 'gravitational time dilation' and wondering when you will next have a spare three hours to watch the film again. Flaws and all.9/10",9,1,7,16 March 2015
Divergent," Best tween film in ages
","I'm glad I got around to watching this, I'm not sure who's writing the negative reviews or what they were expecting but I can honestly say that this is the best tween film I've seen in a long time.It IS a tween film, it's blatantly aimed at young girls and as a 'twenty-something' youngish female, I'm not embarrassed to say that I really enjoyed this film. It's pure fantasy fodder of course but here's what I liked about it:<ul><li>the relationship between the two leads develops naturally i.e. they don't see each other and go 'you're my soulmate', in fact they don't really get on at first so this is believable and refreshing</li></ul><ul><li>the lead actress (Shailene Woodley) playing Tris is extremely natural and one of a very few actors I've ever seen who has convinced me that they are grieving (usually grief in films is just 'oh, they're dead, I'm so upset' ... swiftly moves on with their day..) - Actually both of the leads (Theo James as well) play their roles really well</li></ul><ul><li>I loved the point of view shots like when Tris looks at Four during the training and you see it from his perspective and then the camera cuts to his face to get his reaction to the look she gives him (there are other similar scenes) and it just adds to the effect of feeling like these are real people and I empathised with them more as a result </li></ul><ul><li>Yeah the background story for the city is quite thin but who cares, stranger things have happened in the real world and what I like is that we're given a sense of 'this is what they've been told but is that what's really happened?'. I'm not sure if that's in the book or if the film makers wanted to add some realism for us grown-ups but when they question what's out there, I got the feeling this might be similar to The Island (2005) - that's not a spoiler it's just my opinion and probably totally off base</li></ul>I have now watched this film about 4 or 5 times because I really liked so much of it: the fighting was believable for me because I think we've all gotten used to flashy choreography and sound effects but that's not what real fights look like or how they sound so for me, these fight scenes are really good. I liked the weapons because they kept it simple and for training, they're a good idea.Probably the thing I liked the most is the fact that 'it's not all about Tris'. I mean, it IS all about Tris but it's not 'totally in your face, the world revolves around Tris and no-one else matters' all about Tris... What I mean is that there are some 'films' out there which spend their entire running time having the supporting actors running around warning the lead actress not to have sex with her boyfriend lest he destroy her vagina but in this film, the lead actress often shares centre stage with her new best friend, there are a lot of scenes where she is in the background looking out as opposed to a lot of shots of her standing alone / in the centre and we see her friend fighting too; the focus is just not 'always' on her. Having said that, I do think that there could have been even 'more' focus on the people around her. First of all, had we gotten to know her friends better, we might have empathised with them more (trying not to include spoilers!) and also, this will sound harsh but it needs saying, I'm sick of seeing 'ethnic' people in minor or reduced roles: what a waste of Mekhi Phifer! I wish that Zoë Kravitz had been given more to do, yes she had a decent amount of screen time but I would have liked to maybe see her 'fearscape' and... that's about it for ethnic characters I think... yep.I liked that Jai Courtney's character didn't go overboard as the villain but again, his character was a little one dimensional and I would have liked to have seen some more interaction and dialogue between him and Four just to flesh out their background story.Kate Winslet honestly did the best she could with her part and it's a massive credit to her that she managed to make me severely dislike her and believe that she was evil with just a few odd lines here and there. Her role is to literally just pop into the film every now and then to be a bit menacing and give off a female-Hitler vibe (bright blonde hair). But she pulls it off in my opinion. There's no point in elaborating on why someone is pure evil, we know this exists, it's happened in the real world and it's still happening so her role didn't distract from the believability of the story.Overall, I liked the subtlety of the story. There is no sex, no profanity, no overt 'I love yous' yet it didn't come across as 'after-school-specially' at all. Also, I never groaned out loud once or cringed or had to hide my face behind a pillow while someone professed their undying love for someone they just met a week ago. The dialogue was realistic with occasional over-rehearsed acting from some of the supporting cast but I really loved this film. Go into it knowing it's a tween film and that there won't be a lot of intelligent scientific explanations for things and you'll probably enjoy it as much as I did.9/10",9,55,86,29 July 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Good but the inconsistencies are too distracting
","My general summary is that this is a 'good' film with lots of action, 'some' great acting and is overall well worth watching.Unfortunately, I can't give this more than a 7 (much as I would like to as I love X-Men) because for me, this was as good/disappointing as the Breaking Bad finale.The good:Obviously the 'real' leads: James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Gripping acting from them as per usual. I liked the Sentinels. And Peter Dinklage.That's about it.The bad:I'm not sure there's any point in listing the plot holes and inconsistencies because I'm not very observant so I'm sure people will spot way more than I did and the internet has lots of hilarious pages dedicated to finding the faults. Also, I don't usually care about plot holes but inconsistencies really wind me up because it's so lazy. Decide if you're following the comics or not. If not, make damn sure you follow the events of the previous films. You have to reckon that even if the writers had never heard of X-Men before, 'someone' at some point would have seen the script and gone 'noooo, that can't happen because...' but no. All the way through this film I was rolling my eyes and groaning and shouting and asking 'HOW??', 'WHY??' and the millions of inconsistencies kept taking me out of the film and ruined the experience for me (hence the 7).Jennifer Lawrence. I was never on the bandwagon and I don't hate her either so (that proves?!) this criticism is genuinely an honest opinion: really bad casting. The original Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) moved like a serpent (I mean that in a good way) and had a low sultry voice but Jennifer just looks and sounds like a sulky teenager in most of her scenes. James and Michael are so convincing in part because they nail the accents. Jennifer doesn't even attempt to change her accent or voice. The first time she played Mystique I could overlook it because she was just playing 'the kid version' and wasn't the real Mystique in my eyes but now that she's played her twice, I feel like they want us to think of her as much as being the real Mystique as we do of James and Michael being the real Professor and Eric...but that won't happen until Jennifer drastically improves her acting. She needs to work on her voice and body language.The choreography and costumes: sorry to pick on Jennifer, this is probably wardrobe's fault but maybe the actress requested it? She is blatantly wearing a leotard! Like, 'blatantly'!!! If you're going to play such a proud and distinguished character, you should do it properly and just have the body paint. Isn't she supposed to be naked? i.e. refusing to disguise herself in any way? I've never read the comics but Jennifer's Mystique looks so fake and again, it's distracting. Instead of going for a big name, why not go for an actress who's willing to play the part right?Regarding the choreography throughout the film: There were loads of fight scenes that felt rushed or unfinished or poorly edited...not sure which. Like the sound effects weren't properly added. They weren't always convincing.Why can Kitty Pryde (ridiculous name) send people back in time?? How did the Professor get his body back?? Why is it suddenly acceptable to provide important plot points in DVD commentary? NO, NO, NO! Plot points essential to the development of a story MUST be provided in the film otherwise your film is SH*T!!Tangent: Someone online explained the theory i.e. 'not spoiler' that the Professor got his body back by using the paraplegic's who happened to be his identical twin brother (I don't remember them being identical from the news story in the other film but whatever) and that his twin was in a coma because the Professor's psychic abilities overwhelmed his brother's mind in the womb. Two things wrong with that explanation: 1- The Professor states in this film that he only developed his powers at around 9(ish). A foetus would almost certainly not have reached puberty and would therefore not have been exhibiting any mutant abilities. 2- Even if there was some weird 'developing-foetus glitch' and the Professor did in fact manage to exhibit mutant abilities so powerful it knocked his twin into a coma: 2b- Why has his twin been kept on life support for the last 60 years or so since birth?? 2c- Would that even happen in real life?? 2d- Given that his twin also has to have the exact same abilities otherwise the Professor would now be in a non-mutant body without powers, why would his twin be affected if he has the same genetics and same psychic abilities? I suppose it's possible he just wasn't having a developing-foetus glitch that day like his brother. Unfortunate for him.The point is that if you take over a project and disagree with the death of someone, bring them back in a way that makes sense and also: ACTUALLY EXPLAIN IT !!The ending was great on the one hand because of a reason I can't say but disappointing because it reminded me of the happily ever after of Breaking Bad. Also: that's how you could have brought the Professor back. But whatever.If it wasn't for James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, I would have given this a 6. Just FYI.7/10(I have to ask: why couldn't Bobby/Iceman fly them all away on his ice skateboard whilst Logan was off fixing the past? Or at least just Kitty and Logan?)",7,4,5,25 September 2014
Gone Girl," Engrossing and compulsive viewing
","***The spoiler is in the final paragraph***The film is really long (two and a half hours) but given that there are about three or four stories to tell, it never seems that long.I say the film is engrossing and compulsive viewing because you definitely can't stop watching it but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is good viewing. I kept trying to figure out what the theme of the film was. At various points I thought the story was about gender equality, then I thought it was about how events become twisted in the media and how people are villainised and scrutinised by the general public, then I thought it was just a murder mystery until finally, I realised that there really weren't any genuine themes to the story. It's completely all over the place and basically a cr*pshoot hoping that something will stick. It's impossible for this film not to generate hours of discussion and dissection amongst some people because almost every theme imaginable has been superficially included.Ben Affleck's character behaved very strangely during the investigation - even if you're not happy in your marriage (which is explained at the beginning) this wouldn't explain his lack of engagement with the police and the lack of emotion he displayed. There was absolutely no shock or sense of urgency on his part and from the way the film played out, it appears that this was the case only to keep the viewer guessing about certain issues. Essentially: some things happened only to enable the script to keep the viewer guessing.There were a few random women-hating comments thrown in, likely just to kick up a discussion with feminists, yet at no point was this expanded upon and at no point did I feel that Affleck's character was actually a woman-hater so this character flaw of his made no sense whatsoever.Absolutely terrific acting by Rosamund Pike. I thought everyone involved produced some fantastic acting but especially Rosamund. I think she committed really well to every scene. I didn't understand her character's motivations though. Her narration tried to explain them but it didn't make sense and the blanket, and frankly lazy, excuse of 'psychopath' only explains one or two actions she committed, but certainly not one of the planned events on her calendar.I do feel that too many themes were included making the film a bit of a mess in terms of having a serious point of discussion for viewers, however; after about ten or fifteen minutes, the story is simply too engrossing to worry about any of that and I actually like that the long run time allowed for more story development and crazy things to happen.The ending did feel a bit like 'ok, two and a half hours is enough, let's leave it there now' because nothing extraordinary or interesting happened at the absolute final scene. In my opinion, it would have been a better ending had Affleck's character had a heart to heart with his sister about doing the right thing, and as a result then practised his speech in the mirror while Rosamund's character then made her big announcement during the live interview at which point, there would be serious tension and a terrific acting opportunity for the main characters whilst Affleck's character decided on how to react.Ultimately, it's a must-see yet instantly forgettable so 7/10.",7,0,3,21 December 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," About an hour too long
","Whoever was in charge of this mess needs to never make another superhero film again. I got so angry watching this because even I, knowing nothing about film making, knew that so many scenes should have been edited out or not filmed at all.Much of it felt improvised and badly planned and I cannot believe that in this day and age, Hollywood is still making movies with an all-white cast and a token black (/blue) villain. At one point, another villain actually called him his 'fairy godmother'(!)The script wasn't rubbish but it needed editing. Instead, every single idea, line and scenario suggested during development was included in this ridiculously overlong film.The only saving grace was the action but that got extremely boring because it kicked in from the very beginning so there was no room for progression. It's like Hollywood just said: cute kid, love stuff, action scenes every 5 minutes, a few bad guys (one black/blue) and we'll make a few hundred million.I'm not impressed. I've already forgotten half of the film (the rest will be gone by morning).Tangent-rant: What is the point of a Spider-Man who cannot shoot webs out of his wrists (or body in general)? Without that ability, any villain could create that technology and Spider-Man would no longer be unique. This Spider-Man only has strength, speed and sticky feet. That does not a Spider-Man make I'm afraid. The only justification for the name Spider-Man is having some spider-specific feature built in which he currently does not have.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone obviously had fun together but I only saw the spark between 'them' and not between their characters. This might be because Andrew Garfield has zero screen presence.I don't think it's worth more than a 5 but the effects were great and I wasn't totally bored throughout so I'll give it an extra point.6/10",6,0,3,22 January 2015
Ex Machina," Mostly superb Sci Fi mystery
","I love Sci Fi. I love well-written and well-acted character-driven films and Ex Machina mixes both, albeit with some considerable faults.First off, if you're a fan of this genre, definitely watch Ex Machina. You won't be disappointed. But be warned:The opening sequence was distant and cold and didn't fit the tone of the rest of the film. The first 15 minutes were so unbearably slow and unremarkable that I decided to stop watching. But being such a huge Sci Fi fan, at the last minute, I decided to skip ahead to see if things would get more interesting. I'd skipped to just past the hour mark and I can confirm that 'things would definitely get more interesting'! I skipped back to the scene I'd abandoned and realised that if I had kept watching the second session with Ava for just 20 seconds longer, I would have been fully hooked so my advice: keep watching!From that point forward, the tension was palpable as the interactions between Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) and Nathan (Oscar Isaac) were intensified and there was so much investment in the outcome of the experiment, not to mention the subtle twists and turns of the plot.What really lets the film down is the ending. There is so much anticipation building, so many clever ideas thrown around and it does start off incredible, actually becoming powerful and it seems like it will all pay off in this wonderful climax and then... devastation. Like when your bowling ball is heading towards the gutter and you're urging-pleading-begging it to curve in the opposite direction, but it doesn't.======= ======= =======***SPOILER***(I confirm if Ava lives or dies, I hint strongly at Caleb's fate but there is one shocking twist at the end which I don't discuss.)======= ======= ======= After a powerful scene involving Ava, I realised what was intended for Caleb and I distinctly remember shouting at the screen: 'No!', 'Don't you dare ruin this film!' - Caleb's fate is infuriating because it's not even certain what 'does' happen to him. As it stands, we're clearly expected to believe one thing (otherwise, why bother going to the trouble of filming those events?), but the very first thing that pops into your head is: 'The secondment was for a fixed period', 'Someone knows about this place', 'This guy is a computer genius and has access to all of the best technology'... so it's hard to care when the scenario is so flimsy.Finally, everything we'd been led to believe about Ava's artificial intelligence fell apart the moment she left. Sociopaths are not human, they are machines. The only real test of a human being is our inexplicable ability to feel compassion and show mercy even when it's not expected of us. Is this random? Is this also socially conditioned, or 'programmed', just like everything else about us? I'm not sure, I'll leave that to the experts. But regardless, I would have preferred an ending where Ava walked outside; saw, heard and felt the world, 'turned human' (referencing an earlier conversation in the film) and then went back to Caleb and when asked why she returned, she'd reply (with something less trite than): 'I don't know'. This final interaction would 'prove' her artificial intelligence and they would both leave together.As it stands though, I suppose the chosen ending left them with the option of filming a sequel. I would definitely watch a sequel, but please don't sacrifice a powerful and logical ending to set up another film!This deserved a 9 until the end.7/10",7,2,7,14 May 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Good film, bit cheesy but worth watching
","This film has all the same problems that a lot of Disney films have: I'm not just talking about the family friendliness of them and the inevitable cheese that brings; they also seem to have problems with their values. They always feel 'old-fashioned' like they haven't realised that the world is changing and we don't expect to see men behaving like stereotypical 'gentlemen' or 'players who meet their soul mate and change their ways'. We don't need to see the woman be saved by the man and the protagonists don't have to be white (or brown but covered with green paint). I just think that Disney need to get in touch with today's reality.Also, the CGI was fairly bad in a lot of places and the story and script were very predictable most of the time.So it seems that when you have a cheesy, predictable, old-fashioned and clichéd story to tell, the answer these days is to make sure it's funny.Which brings me to why I've given this a 7 and why I would recommend watching it: it's genuinely funny! I laughed out loud a fair few times and I was never bored.There's no real character development, most of the characters are one-dimensional but it's fun! I think this should be a TV series although the amazing Firefly didn't last long so I doubt this would either.7/10(and bring back Firefly please)",7,2,7,13 November 2014
The Imitation Game," Superficial and lazy
","This was fairly bad. If you choose to make a film which focuses on one character, it should really be an in-depth and detailed character study but unfortunately, I found this to be a very superficial 'made for Oscars' type film.I didn't learn anything about the Turing machine itself, for example; the engineering aspects, the design, literally no information whatsoever about how it worked was given and this was something I was really interested in. There was only one aspect of Turing's childhood included and nothing more about his life at home or university. We don't see any of his (then) illegal 'interactions' and the historical detail was fairly sparse.In terms of detail, it felt like the script was written after a brief consultation of Wikipedia.I'm a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I really am but he's not a strong actor and never has been. He's fantastic in Sherlock and Star Trek but I don't think he plays 'real' people very well. In fact, Turing, as depicted here, seems to have the exact same sense of humour as Sherlock...Keira Knightley was the biggest surprise here, she genuinely transformed herself into a completely different person yet I doubt she'll get the same recognition that Cumberbatch will. She once mentioned as her character in London Boulevard (2010), that women are often written into films purely so that the male lead actor has someone to discuss all of his problems with - for the audience to hear. That's something I now pay attention to in most films I watch and this one is no different. I think we see one scene related to her own personal life (at home with her parents) and then it's swiftly back to Cumberbatch.There's a lot of posturing, posh accents and generally interesting subject matter but unfortunately, I learned nothing about Alan Turing, nothing about the workings of the machine, and in terms of entertainment value, I would probably have got more enjoyment from reading about Turing on Wikipedia.6/10",6,2,8,16 January 2015
Les Misérables," Not as good as it should and could have been
","I'm going to start by saying that I'm reviewing this film as someone who knew nothing about this story before the film was released. I haven't seen the play / read the book etc. so I am only reviewing the film.I've read some comments that 'you have to know the background to understand' etc. and this really annoys me. By that logic, all films are fantastic because we should be able to fill in the plot holes ourselves and we should expect to have to continue a storyline in our own minds to make sure the film makes sense...The main reason for giving the film 6 out of 10 is that anything I don't switch off i.e. anything I watch all the way through, gets an automatic 5 and then if there are any good points on top of that, I will increase my rating.The film gets a 6 from me because (as you'd expect with this type of Oscar-bait film) all of the actors give their best and we get to see some fantastic performances from everybody involved.My problem with the film is that it just wasn't a very good story.Again; I'm sure the novel went into so much more detail but that's not what I'm criticising here. The story as depicted in the film is extremely bare and jumps from one 'monologue' to another with some grand scenes and often random musical numbers in between. A lot of the time the singing is annoying because the songs are not particularly memorable (a few are very good) - sometimes people just start singing their lines without there being a real song. I'm not sure how to explain that but it's annoying!It feels like in order to give every actor their '15 minutes' they don't have time to really develop each plot. Some things happen that just make absolutely no sense and are not explained - I don't care if it's explained in the book - if you want to make a film then try to make a good film; don't make a bad film and tell people who criticise you that they should read the book!There are many great elements in this film as mentioned already; the acting but also some of the musical numbers really are great and clearly a lot of effort went into this but given that they had two and a half hours to develop the plot, I don't think there's really an excuse for the lack of plot and character development.Congrats to them for finding a young girl to play Cosette who looks almost identical to the portrait on the original novel (or so says my limited Wikipedia-research). The poster for this film is really eye-catching. Now, when you have higher praise for the marketing team and casting than the film makers, you know there may be a problem.Worth watching but not the epic it's made out to be and whilst the actors and set designers etc. deserve awards, the film itself does not I'm afraid.6/10",6,1,2,19 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Huge disappointment
","What a let down.I have no idea how this film has gotten such high ratings.I would have given this a 6 but I was just waiting for it to end about halfway through and that's never a good sign. It wasn't very entertaining. Someone has already mentioned on the message boards that the film was really shallow with bad acting and nonsense scenes. Well, I can't say that there was anything wrong with the acting but the story was a mess, most of it didn't make sense or wasn't clear enough.A lot from the previous films in the franchise was re-done here like repeated one-liners, actors and past events which made it feel less original.There was no character development and the film was nowhere near as funny as the other films. I didn't laugh once, I didn't care about this film at all and it was all just very unoriginal and uninspired.The fight scenes were boring and poorly choreographed.It took itself far too seriously and I hope they make one more which mirrors how fantastic the first one was with a clearer villain and storyline, funny moments and cooler fight scenes, maybe Bourne-style!But this one was just a mess and extremely boring.I did like the introduction of two 'Batman' characters and I hope this is developed more in the next film, if there is one.5/10",5,4,10,19 November 2012
The Purge," Typical but really good home invasion thriller
","If you like home invasion films (Panic Room, The Collector, Hostage) then I don't see any reason why people wouldn't like this.From what I can understand, the over-the-top negative reviews (1 star?!) are from people who felt misled by the hype so I suppose this is a reason to avoid watching trailers and reading too many reviews as your expectations will greatly affect your enjoyment of a film. For example, I loved Pain and Gain (2013) and it really is funny but I talked about it so much at work that my friend didn't enjoy it as much.So I'll try to be concise about why this film is good without going overboard with my review:<ul><li>It's a home invasion film. Nothing more, nothing less</li></ul><ul><li>As with all heavily 'genre-d' films such as rom-coms, there has to be a unique premise for the film and with home invasions, the reason the home is being invaded is the unique factor</li></ul><ul><li>There is genuine tension in the film</li></ul><ul><li>I liked the family but there could have been more character development in the beginning... but do we really care? Well, yes because the more you know and care about the family, the more tense it will be but it doesn't let the film down</li></ul><ul><li>There was maybe one moment where I groaned out loud at a dumb thing a character did, but for the rest of the film the characters were allowed to make realistic decisions and not be idiots like in other films (you know, where someone does something no-one would ever do in real life just to set up the next scene)</li></ul><ul><li>Not all elements of the ending were predictable</li></ul>This was a fun and entertaining way to spend less than an hour and half, just go in with the knowledge that it's home invasion with a new, interesting premise. That's all.My vote, 8/10",8,1,2,3 November 2013
Looper," Wow
","Truly excellent.I'm sure there are plot holes and I'm sure there are weaknesses but it is rare that a film like this comes along.Pretty much anything with Joseph Gordon-Levitt is going to be great (see; 'Hesher' 2010) and I love Bruce Willis so I was really excited about this film.It has everything; action, story, love-stuff, scary bad-ass kid, great acting, shocks, guns, witty dialogue...I can't even be bothered trying to remember any critiques. I usually put a few in for authenticity but too many fantastic scenes keep coming back to me.The violence was sometimes a bit shocking right from the opening scene but it wasn't gratuitous. If you shot someone in real life, I'm sure the person wouldn't daintily fall to the ground with glitter pouring out of the bullet hole so no complaints from me there.There were times when the script became more serious then slapstick then comedic then violent and this occasionally jarred a bit but I decided I ultimately liked this because some films get stale part way through because it's the same thing over and over but with 'Looper', I never got bored and each scene offered something different. Sometimes we have funny moments in life and sometimes we get serious so this is more true to real life than films that stay deadly serious all the way through to attain the 'serious film' tag.I don't often give films 10/10 (think I've done it once, not sure) but this deserves it. It wasn't perfect but IMDb rates a 10 as 'excellent' and that it definitely was.10/10",10,2,8,14 November 2012
