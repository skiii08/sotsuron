Captain Phillips," The internal struggle of a true leader
","The way that Captain Phillips leads the crew through the unlucky event is inspiring. A real leader trusted by his crew in the case of danger. The internal strugle of a man trying to stay strong and take the right decision for his life and the lives of others on each turn is captivating. I found the mental breakdown in the end very real. Needless to say, another great performance by Tom Hanks. I also found the dynamics in the pirate gang very interesting.",8,0,0,6 June 2020
