Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Most overrated film of the year
","This is one of the worst films I've seen this year. I was recommended this movie by people who normally are on the same wavelength as me, but are obviously not if they consider this a good movie. They said the movie was hilarious. At best I'd call it mildly amusing. I have to question the IQ of anyone who calls this movie hilarious. I thought racist humour like calling black people 'chocolate faced' died years ago but apparently not. If you like racist, sexist, discriminatory jokes than this is your cup of tea and when the DVD comes out you can add it to your Roy Chubby Brown collection. Hopefully now that he has released a movie of Borat, hopefully Sacha Baron Cohen. Hopefully he'll try something new instead of using his provocateur interviewing exactly like his Ali G character which he copied directly from the likes of Dennis Pennis.",2,23,45,27 November 2006
