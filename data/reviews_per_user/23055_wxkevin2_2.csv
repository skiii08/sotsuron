The Blair Witch Project," 8 out of 10
","I think I had such high expectations that I was kind of let down. Overall the concept is awesome, the story is great, the ending was spectacular. What I didn't like was that half of the dialogue was 'What the f*** was that!' It was spooky, but I don't think it was scary per se. It is a good movie though.",8,1,1,3 August 1999
Moulin Rouge!," Amazing!
","My wife and I were pleasantly surprised that one of the inflight movies on the way to our honeymoon in Hawaii was Moulin Rouge. We, especially her, had been wanting to see it for a while. After the movie was over, we were spellbound! The music was tremendous and catchy. We literally could not stop singing the songs all week while in Hawaii. On the way back from Hawaii, guess what movie was playing again! We both looked at each other like 2 little kids and quickly grabbed our headsets so we could watch it a second time. The story is beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. I highly recommend seeing it with an open mind. Seeing this movie with a closed mind will ruin its beauty. Remember, 'All you need is love!'.",10,0,1,5 October 2001
