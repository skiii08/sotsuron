Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," It's elementary Watson: this movie sucked, was it Grand Theft Sherlock?
","It is ironic that Sherlock Holmes uses deduction and logic and this movie throws that out the window in favor of a confusing mess of roller coaster images.'bullet-cam' worked very well in Three Kings but only for a few instances and brilliantly. Ritchie has invented 'roller coaster cam'. Guy Ritchie seems to think a 'bullet-cam' should be used constantly even for the slightest scenes. It is not clever but tiring and way, way, way overdone.The plot is weak at best and confused by constantly noisy effects and over loud music and soundtrack, and a somewhat muddled dialog track.Sherlock Holmes in the old, old movie with Basil Rathbone, engaged the audience with clever deduction, logic, verbal bantering and clever writing and editing.Ritchie decides to make Grand Theft Sherlock, to the horror of fans who love the subtlety of Doyle. Ritchie really needs to read Doyle before making another mess. Read the original stories folks, you will be richly rewarded.Within a few months you will have forgotten you saw this mess, and when the third ones comes out, you will have forgotten the messy early ones.Oh,the plot, something about world war and saving the world and war is human condition, yada, yada, yada...I think Ritchie's mom gave him a camera for Christmas and he said, 'Look ma, I can take one second shots of everything and people will think it is a movie'.",4,44,93,29 December 2011
Molly's Game," Yak athon non thriller
","If you like a movie with constant yaking...this is for you.
If you like a movie with boring characters on the screen exchanging boring
dialogue or voice over with boring details...see this film.
Geez. I fell asleep 4 times.
Injured skier turns to creating a high stakes poker game.
There it is..That is the story line
That is the elevator pitch. What a concept!Oh, and the gamblers are boring too! Oh, they were movie stars,and
rich folks...whoopee doo.If 'Molly' didn't wear high heels, tight skirts, show lots of cleavage, and
wear red lipstick and blue eye shadow...the movie wouldn't last 10 seconds. But even that isn't enough to keep viewers interested. Her lawyer was the most
interesting character. He should have dropped her case as soon as her saw her and her arrogance.Molly is a non stop talk fest with voices that are better than sleeping pills for making you doze off.
Molly has the same MONO TONE voice through out the entire film,
and what she says is equally boring.Want a thriller?
Try: Catch me if you Can
Now You See Me 1 & 2.Molly was a talking head video without any compositional interest.
And the ending was Say What? After all this?This is the Cliff Notes version or cartoon version of Silkwood, a REAL movie
about a very courageous women who help stopped a nuclear disaster.
vs. women who starts high stakes poker game. Really? What a career goal.
Wait...maybe this was satire on movies like this....ah..nah.",1,3,8,16 May 2019
Nightcrawler," Zoom in and check out this flick
","Although most of you know the plot by now, I found the story to be very accurate as I did work as a 'stringer' for news stations in Indianapolis awhile ago.Jake is great as an up an coming 'if it bleeds it leads' camera prowler looking for a story. Reminds me of the famous Wee Gee who covered the police beat in NYC in the 1930s with his trunk full of camera gear and a police scanner. Coverage and the need for a 'bleeds it lead' story hasn't changed much.Jake really fills the role of an up and coming, 'wannabe' news night time stringer. His performance reminded me of the great performance of Robbin Williams in One Hour Photo. Truly stunning jobs by both of them. Bill Paxton was wonderful as the grizzled Nightcrawler.Lots of news satire in this movie and the great line of course is from Rene Russo (hot) when she says 'we are interested in the uptick in suburban crime and how crime is spilling out to the burbs.' I just sent an email to 5 of my friends to watch this movie.However, I think the dialog was a bit too wordy and more like an essay at times and dragged the story down a little. Remember For a Few Dollars more and the man with no name and little to say. There seemed to be a little too much psycho babble by the character and his actions made a lot of the points anyway. I didn't think that at the end he needed to say to his partner who just died in a shoot out that he was just a story lead, it was obvious. So less verbosity would have really made a better movie, I think. Sometimes too much dialog is like hitting the brake on an Indy Race Car before it crosses the finish line.But all in all a wonderful cast, great visuals, good direction, great writing, cool subtle soundtrack, and current absorbing storyline.There was another film, Paparazzi, that viewers may also want to check out.",8,0,0,19 March 2015
The Mist," Weather: Heavy Mist not Fog, stay indoors and see another movie
","Fog was a much superior film, directed by John carpenter.The Mist, at best merits about 1/2 hour in the Twilight Zone.The Mist is created by some Army guys messing around with different dimensions resulting in a 'mist' with giant bugs. The action centers around folks caught in a supermarket.Far too much of the film is in the supermarket with inane dialog and a crazy fanatic bible thumper. It is supposed to represent 'the human condition' but is totally predictable with all the people bitching a each other.In reality, most folks come together in time of crisis and do not squabble over petty politics and polemics. Witness the floods in the mid west several years ago and how everyone helped everyone. Or witness the cooperative behavior of good folks during the tornadoes in southern Indiana last year.Most crisis create cooperation not conflict.The 'religiosity' theme would have worked in the 50's but is lost in the modernity of the new millennium.I can't believe that Darabont, who directed The Shawkshank Redemption, a truly great film, wasted his energy on this garbage. Yes the acting was really good, too bad no one had much to say. The usually scary tactics were played out as usual but the CGI bugs, were really not bad. How this movie cost 26 million and takes place in basically one location, the supermarket, is beyond me. Don't tell me it cost 22 million in CGI. It seems to take place in Portland, OR which could be better off with a 'mist' to eliminate some of the smug, herbal groovy, sustainable religious folks.Ending is unsatisfying, yet meant to be a 'shocking' and 'ironic' twist on a usual plot, but you could see it coming a mile away. Oh, and the music sound track at the ending is way overwhelming..they should have used something much less ponderous, like maybe Glassworks, by Phillip Glass. I hear that pseudo Monkish, Russian sound way too often over trivial concepts.The Mist could easily be reedited to 1/2 hour and (Twilight zoned). I say, keep Frank in a prison not a supermarket to reveal his real talents.",5,0,3,24 June 2012
The Hurricane," The Hurricane not a TKO
","That this movie is finely crafted is beyond doubt. The acting is good, and it is nicely photographed and edited, but when it belies the truth it drops several notches down.According to many posters and factual material, the story line takes great liberty with the facts of Carter's life. A similar story was told in I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG with Paul Muni. Innocent man goes to jail, escapes, gets caught, goes back to jail. Only he was innocent and Carter seems guilty of a lot of antisocial activity.In a sense the movie is racist because it portrays facts that are seemingly untrue for dramatic effect and to sell the film to 'gullible' audiences searching for racism everywhere.One of the lines in the movie is by the kid who is 'adopted' by the Canadian couple, 'are you helping me because I am black or do you have pity for me', all too often the answer is yes, which is a demeaning attitude. During an interview, Tracy from SNL, was asked about Loren Michael hiring him and he said that Loren said, ' I am hiring you because you are funny, not because you are black,' and Tracy said that made all the difference to him in his career.This movie really serves to fan the fires of injustice not to shed light on it. In the Heat of the Night and The Shawshank Redemption are much better examples of racial injustice and interracial friendships.Perhaps if were called Round One, and been totally fictional it would have been more inspiring.",6,0,0,17 April 2011
The Conjuring," jump out of your seat happenings
","I went to a sneak preview and the audience liked the movie as did I. Almost did not go because of all the terrible paranormal TV 'reality' shows which kept hammering the constant theme of 'what was that'? OMG. > commercial < 'oh it was a cat'. This is a real movie. With a real script. And real actors. And real drama. And a coherent story.Big difference.I thought the unfolding of the story was well done as were the paranormal happenings that kept increasing. A couple with several kids move to a house that they bought at an auction only to discover that it is 'haunted' with the ghosts of people who were murdered or took their own lives.Slowly they come to realize that there is some presence and get some experts in paranormal behavior to come and see and maybe perform an 'exorcism'. And yes, it has echos of other films like Exorcist, Amityville Horror and others.Well structured with thrills and mystery, it is a good film and a logical extension to the 'Paranormal' security camera series of films to something more dramatic and with more camera angles, lighting and camera movement.Enjoy.",7,15,31,16 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Boring plot, bad villains, Dark Knight sinks to new low
","Sure this is a visually bombastic movie and will leave you hearing impaired for several hours after listening to the banging drums to spur on boring sequences. But the movie flops with a brutish character and McGuffin that was used in the 1983 Octopussy. You know the OMG nuclear bomb threat. Thankfully Roger Moore stopped that bad Russian guy. Bain is a bad guy right out of Road Warrior, without the butt cheeks showing. Send Bain back to Road Warrior where he belongs.Nolan drops the ball and goes for pure visuals not story telling. Did anyone understand that murky dialog through that 'Lecter Mask'. Perhaps Nolan was making a spoof on Batman, or it seemed so. But plot is not important when you plan on sales to Asia not America.And guy arming the Nuclear Bomb, was....drum roll, a Russian. Even tho in real life the Iranians are planning a nuke. Why are they never the bad guys. Oh, of course Nolan is worried about being PC, where Russians and Germans are typically stereotyped as the villains. He needs to movie the Batman ethos 50 years ahead to today. He is afraid like Hollywood to name extremist 'religious' radicals and Iran as the bad guys. Go with tried and true Germans (who are saving Europe financially) or Russians (dealing with US bases surrounding them). Wait tho, did Bain force the Russian to put his hand there? Can't remember.The only visual thing I remember is the coat flapping in the wind as he rides that all too cool motorcycle....and and..oh how hot Catwoman is in her little black tight dress. That is the 'take home' visual.Did everyone catch all the 911 allusions. They could have called this movie 911 Redeux. 3,000 police trapped in a tunnel, debris everywhere, etc. Oh, and the trite reference to Katrina on the bridge with the cops and kids. All to obvious a Rip off riff.There was way too much screen time wasted on Batman recovering from the jail cell and is right out of Clint Eastwood, Fist Full of Dollars where he is beaten and has to recover to shoot the bad guys.The Dark Knight Rises is nothing more than a re hash and copy of several films already out there...but you will enjoy getting away from the thumping sound track pounding..pounding to get your blood going, when you leave the movie.Rehashing tired old borrowed plots does not make a modern movie. Nolan should have stayed with memory issues not go into Spielberg territory and big story telling. Maybe he should go to HBO where he can do great stuff like Momento and Insomnia, really great small films.As the cop says at an accident, 'Keep moving folks nothing to see here'.",6,2,8,3 October 2012
