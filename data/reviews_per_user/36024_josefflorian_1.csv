Requiem for a Dream," One must be as OBJECTIVE as possible
","I've read a lot of reviews on this movie, most of which highly praise it with a few others highly criticizing it, albeit with valid points. In this review I will try to be as objective as possible.The general feedback by the non-praisers was that the film is 'over the top'. Come to think of it....yes the movie is over the top in some of its parts. There are various actions done by characters in the movie which are clearly unrealistic or exaggerated, especially throughout the last 30 minutes. Also, by characters i do not simply refer to the 4 main ones.On the other hand I have to be true to myself and realize that I (like many others apparently) didn't notice these flaws on the first viewing. And why is it that these highly apparent flaws have gone unnoticed? My explanation is that this movie is not primarily focused on reality and facts, but rather on drug sensations. As a person who never took drugs, I still felt nauseated, confused, psychologically afraid, and with no sense of time throughout the whole movie. Everything from the music, editing, lighting, camera angles, acting and continuity, made this movie a drug in itself. Its a movie which should not be compared to Trainspotting or Blow which emphasize completely different points. Being so 'high' with just watching the movie, it was very difficult for me to notice such clear flaws.Is this necessarily a bad thing? Well it depends on how the director wanted us to feel, and also on the viewer. If Arnofsky wanted this movie to be like a drug experience felt in his viewers, then I have to give this movie an 11/10, with 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' a close second. If on the other hand, his aim was to be realistic, depict drug usage circumstances and facts about drug culture, then this movie delves very little in these areas and might not appeal to you.Others criticized the movie for having too much of a simplistic message (Don't do drugs cos they're bad for you. Look, this is what'll happen to you if you become a dealer/junky). But then again, when is it that film making has become primarily storytelling as opposed to creating a mood? It may be true however that this movie might be offensive to drug users or others who know about or are involved in the business, possibly due to some images shown and the circumstances of the characters, possibly being stereotypical and somewhat clich√©. It may be the case that Arnofsky used over dramatization/unrealistic circumstances to enhance the mood, (some may argue that this dramatization was not needed) and if so, he has managed well. (Remember Kill Bill Vol 1? Exaggerated graphic violence to create the anime mood?) Finally on a personal, subjective note: I loved the movie because of the way it is packaged. I especially loved the acting, the way the director used the shots, the fast editing and sound effects, lighting, and the music! I think this was a package to create and compliment the mood and feeling the movie is trying to create...and hey...it worked for me at least!",9,1,2,8 January 2008
