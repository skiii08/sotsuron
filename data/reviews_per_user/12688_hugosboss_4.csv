Hereditary," You'll wonder who's writing the reviews on here
",First off...this is NOT a good film. Or average. Gabriel Byrne is wasted but I guess The usual Suspects pt 2 isn't coming out. Or millers crossing. The story is convoluted. You won't try to guess what's going on...you just won't care. If 'weird' is the new 'good' maybe this is there. But save your money.,1,28,66,8 June 2018
Terminator Salvation," mcG?
","the producers should be ashamed to think mcG could handle this movie....this was very disappointing.mcG is a music video director, no more. i'd sooner trust one of the pixar directors than mcg.the action sequences are good...that is a given, but i really don't care about the characters and we know how the story will end, so you HAVE to spend more time with the characters. the Sam Worthington character had ENORMOUS potential that was wasted, like the movie.i hope to god they get James Cameron, or anyone else to do t5. i'd vote for Guillermo del toro...Wolfgang Petersen...Alfonso cuaron...me.",1,16,40,27 May 2009
Deadpool 2," Low expectations.
",I'm not a fan boy. But I'll be directWinter soldier > Deadpool 2 = guardians 1 > Deadpool 1 > avengers infinity > Thor rag > black panther > guardians 2,10,1,2,23 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Meh.
",It's like graffiti on a Jackson pollack painting while listening to a Mozart opera at a Chinese buffet. Individually...great parts. Some better than others. All together...too jumbled.,7,1,8,26 April 2018
