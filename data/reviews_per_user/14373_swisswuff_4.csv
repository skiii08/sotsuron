Minority Report," Builds on 'insights' (attn: contains possible spoilers)
","Minority Report builds on some apparent 'insights', that, once you know those, will unravel the movie even before 10 minutes are over. Two important dice have already been rolled beforehand, and you will recognise them so quickly it makes your seat hurt. Dice one. ' good hunter of murderers, deep down, must be a murderer himself'. This 'wisdom' walks the earth with many faces: social workers, that have vast experience as prisoners themselves; pediatricians that once were repeatedly children patients and know the ins and outs of hospitals themselves; and of course the 'hunted turned into hunter'. This leads - with the flick of one eye - to the person behind the whole thing, the murderer who covers everything up. It also underlies Tom Cruise's character's motivation, that makes the movie goer believe that subliminal revenge is a good means as motivation to become a police officer. Dice two. 'Release the underdogs'. In Spielberg movies, one particularly important and prevailing element of portraying 'goodness' comes about by 'releasing the underdogs'. That element prevails in many of his movies in various forms (including Jurassic Park, but also many others), and adds to everybody 'feeling good about' the movie when walking out. Which is why, of course and surely, you will guess the fate of the pre-cogs to begin with. In combining the two elements above, one will immediately realise that a third principle emerges: the victim of a child murder can never be 'bad' in such a movie. That's why it is so blantantly obvious that Tom Cruise's character as well as that character's wife end up on the 'good' side in the end of the movie. This, again, leaves only one interesting suspect. In other words: the basic assumptions, the world view, this movie builds upon, are gridlocked against each other in a way that the script itself can compile only to one possible solution: the one we get to see. While the basic counter argument to this pre-crime-scheme apparently is the killer sentence 'You still have a choice', the movie itself does not follow that form. The script of this movie is gridlocked by basic assumptions that leave the viewer with nothing to hope or worry about after learning the basic setup of the story. The one thing that varies with Spielberg movies, that use a very limited and small set of 'assumptions' that - logically - will lead every viewer to the right conclusion very early in any of his movies - is maybe the core target audience. In Minority Report, the target audience is probably everybody who works in hierarchies whose members may have hidden agendas. Have you been set up by your boss? What is your motivation for your job? etc. This is another one of a whole sequence of 'movies according to the world of Spielberg', and there is nothing wrong with it. As such, it is not possible to compare this movie to anything else - because Spielberg movies simply don't compete. One may add that the effects of this movie are nice.",Null,0,0,5 October 2002
Lost in Translation," Cultural bias is the essence of the movie.
","People debate whether the possibly 'deep' portrayal of both main characters and the contrasting 'superficial' and distorted view Japanese culture constitutes some type of cultural bias or even racism. I can not see why this is a question, as this film is heavily culturally biased. In essence, that is how this film works, but cultural bias is not the focus of this movie. To blame this movie of it's most important tool would be missing the point.We are presented this movie through the eyes of the main characters Bob and Charlotte. Both are white American citizens who seem to share views on what one would like to achieve in life.Their real problem is their inability to connect to other people on a larger scale. Their marriages suffer from their inability to connect to their spouses. Their own soul suffers from their inability to even connect to themselves. They lack interest in current affairs of other people who are different - and at present, Japanese people, which they perceive exactly as they are portrayed in this movie: loud and unsophisticated. So, Bob and Charlotte regard Japanese people in a loud and unsophisticated way, which is why they are portrayed that way. All of these clues show that Bob and Charlotte suffer from some human and cultural inability that spells out as 'un-able'.The movie does not say that all Japanese people behave superficial, loud and grotesque, and the movie does not say that all Americans are culturally unable - all the movie says is that Bob and Charlotte are two Americans in Tokyo, and they have a lot of problems.Yet, these two un-able people connect through being as unevolved as they are, because through their clumsiness, similar problems occur to them, similar life experiences form, and that is how they find out that they 'share' things. They don't set out to learn Japanese. They don't attempt to meet Japanese people who are normal (instead of being superficially loud and grotesque). They don't do anything to leave the beaten path of their white American average culture. And see what missing out on all this does to them! One can not describe their personal situation as 'suffering', as they are not truly 'suffering'. They live in a 'self-made hell', or rather, a hell that comes about by not doing anything oneself. Both Bob and Charlotte suffer from a high degree of lethargy; no wonder, cynicism and an enhanced longing for passive understanding are consequences. They find that in sharing all of this, they 'belong' together and since they lack any positive common definition of fun, they go through 'deep' moments.Both Bob and Charlotte would lose their common ground if they went ahead to be more active. Charlotte could start playing a more active role in her husband's life. Bob could hang out with some Japanese friends on the weekend, maybe invite them to the USA for a hiking trip later. Both could start trying out whatever there is in Tokyo to do - and it is hard to imagine that such could not fill at least two movies. But by doing that, they would find out differences between each other, and they would have to bridge interpersonal gaps they already had problems to bridge with other people beforehand.It does not surprise that legions of people that share such difficulties think that this is a great, and 'deep' movie. Many Americans and Europeans define themselves as 'not this' and 'not that', but negative cultural definitions never bring about much common ground, and that can truly be felt.Now, this is 2005, and life should have much more to offer than sharing cultural inabilities. Bob and Charlotte should be investigating museums, shows, food, culture, people, language, scenery, agriculture - whatever. Yet they don't do that.Indirectly - without direct translation, if you remember the title - we perceive in this movie that ultimately, the beauty of this piece lies in the weight that this 'belonging together' ends up being attributed: it is only a weak tie that forms between the two protagonists. They obviously define themselves - and each other - over what they can not do, and that does not suffice to make them, or for that part anyone else, a couple that can face challenges and venture out into the unknown of different cultures. Too weak to handle life, too weak to go together, drowning in passivism, unable for anything else but distorted cartoonish views on other cultures. Any other director would have had Bob and Charlotte have a most dirty affair with each other - but not so Ms. Coppola. And that is the true beauty of this movie.",4,1,4,30 May 2005
Hancock," Clearly discriminating and disdainful
","I watched this movie in a rather well filled cinema.When we left, people really stared at me. And their stares were not friendly.This movie makes fun of the violent loss of first one, then the other hand, of a villain. And the villain then gets to wear a hook prosthesis.Guess what. I went to that movie wearing a hook prosthesis myself.The appearance of the villain is sneering and cynical. However, the humor is cheap and foreseeable and that is why I wonder why they could not have left such tasteless discrimination out? I did not like this situation at all.",1,7,20,28 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," What Anakin really suffers from (possible spoilers)
","Despite the Star Wars double trilogy to contain a range of plot holes, there is no doubt over a deeper meaning of the motivation for Anakin turning over to the dark side. This may need to be pointed out verbally here, because a great number of people miss this crucial point of Anakin's character: there is no 'logic', however, as one either knows about this human condition, or one does not. Growing up in an emotionally cold environment with subsequent early - and possibly violent - loss of loved ones, can, in fact, cause a person to exhibit the very behavior that makes Anakin Skywalker later known as Darth Vader rage through these sequels. One hint Lucas gives us, is the emotionally cold interior architecture that surrounds much of Anakin's adolescence. Anakin clings to his Padme. Anakin's biography and his actions show that he longs for emotional support and he will offer everything else gladly: his skills, his presence, his alertness, his own health. He suffers from not being accepted as a Jedi master, he second-guesses himself as well as others. And for good reasons: Anakin is in fact exploited and betrayed by all of his friends in various degrees - the chancellor, the senators, anyone - as they all sense that he can be exploited as he is emotionally wounded, and as they see this weakness as an advantage as much as they see it as a risk. Anakin will take any risk - he is severely injured which does not mean too much to him - in order to get his emotional uproar back to normal. No one in his immediate environment - his wife, his friends - find a way to tell him upfront, that he is a hot shot but that he needs to get serious therapy first. Not making an effort to finding a way to tell him constitutes betrayal on their behalf - that is why they 'deserve' their later fate. Typically for an emotional void, the later Anakin Darth Vader will exhibit a focus on technical gadgets to a degree that makes every middle aged guy's career crisis pale in comparison - and still, he suffers. Anakin is the poster boy for a modern generation that turns to materialism, that is super at fixing bodies but sucks at fixing souls, and that may not take as much time to process emotions, love, and loss any more as necessary.Similarly to Anakin, persons in similar situations do not process dilemmas well, they do not perform well in difficult negotiations, there is a lack of outward emotional orientation (emotions are mainly scanning the own soul), and if there is one thing Anakin longs for, it is to be emotionally accepted without having to negotiate it over and over again. He wants unconditional love as an adult since he never seemed to have it as a child. He will take any risk and does not mind getting bruised or injured - if only he is shown love and acceptance. He can not even deal with self respect - let alone respecting others - as he is still fighting to get back what he missed since the day he was born: unconditional love and emotional warmth. It turns out that the only person to offer him the illusion of love and acceptance in a half ways acceptable way is the chancellor and later emperor: he sticks with his plan of giving Anakin what he thinks he needs. The emperor fails Anakin on a number of occasions, and that will be his ultimate demise - but again, it is typical for people growing up emotionally neglected or abused, who go through a number of losses, to turn into edgy characters with an all-or-nothing response, who will do everything for one person while walking over anyone else, as long as their expectations are met.This is the dire reality of many people alive. Despite the absence of hints as to any ways out of such situations, this makes the movie so watchable, and Anakin such a key person to these Star Wars episodes, far more than other characters that do not deal with such problems. Yes, Anakin's body is severely wounded but that is nothing compared to the wounds he carries - and already carried - in his soul. These emotional wounds are a big motor for this movie. If you think about Anakin getting himself some helpful support by sitting through talks with some Jedi psychiatrists, and if you think about him getting his emotional problems sorted out at an early age - all of the following drama would not have occurred, and he would have been the proud father of twins in a peaceful place somewhere in the future.The way out of such soul traps, however, is not just to turn to a religion or to turn to some type of Yodaism. These are a mere breeze to a tormented soul. What it really takes is a psychological or psychiatric analysis, it takes professional talking, and as for all other large wounds: it takes attention, devotion and time. One must accept that a wounded soul sometimes can not 'just heal' - one must take active steps. To feel one's own emotions and to find ways to walk a path with other people, to yield, to focus, to listen - that is what one must seek to learn, and it is hard enough to live through situations even then. As in this movie, reality deteriorates too at times: some people can not listen, they walk emotionally wounded, they end up getting exploited, they will become hateful and revengeful for good reasons, they only focus on themselves in absence of better guidance, violence ensues, and from a certain point on, there is no way back.",10,3,9,22 May 2005
