It," Not creepier than the original
","The original cannot be beat, and Tim Curry was, as expected, not beat. The original just has that funny+creepy touch this one can't live up to, and the costume is not satisfying. I tried but was unable to dive into the world itself and become that kid. The original managed to bring me in that way.It was good of course. The actors did well, nice cinematography, Bill did well (and the ending is better than the original), but it just didn't haunt me as the original did. He didn't look and perform as creepy, even though he was creepy. I just got the feeling of a typical modern horror movie, which has its flaws. Definitely worth a cinematic watch. Do not let this horror movie slip through and end up on a small computer screen. One of the better horror movies of the decade.",6,20,39,11 September 2017
The Notebook," Not that romantic. Disappointed.
","This movie is highly overrated, and Allie is pure trash. She was with a kid for a month, went on with her life for like 10 years. She met another guy, was with him for years and engaged, for then to run off to boink the other guy and slut herself. How is that romantic? It was such a non-romantic way to play the movie. She could've met him again, feelings arising, for then to decide and break it off, for she goes on to shagging the guy. What the ...The Notebook is only a bit romantic when you isolate events. As a whole, Allie is pure trash. Even as an adult she commits disgusting adultery.",5,4,6,16 February 2017
Get Out," Mediocre - do not follow the hype
","Its concept was riveting, and it started out really well. During the build-up I felt compelled to keep watching, but it all went downhill the moment he started stabbing everyone, enduring deadly wounds and stabs like they were nothing. As if he was a trained special ops on steroids, mentally tempered for every situation (from being a frightened little boy).The ending though ... was bleak at best. A total let-down. Anti- climactic.",5,3,10,19 April 2017
It Chapter Two," Boring
","Just as boring as Part 1.The original brings out the true creeps. Tim Currys version is just extremely creepy in comparison. I think they ruined the whole experience with the ridiculous outfit as wll. IT doesn't look like a clown in these adaptations, he looks like a demon in some combination-suit. You don't get the clownish creepy feeling at all, which in the original was mixed perfectly with comedy and horror.This is just another modern age evil-grin demon 'horror' movie. Evil and anger, that's it. It's so boring, we've seen it so many times.A disappointing 2/10",2,1,2,9 September 2019
