Walk the Line," yes, you should see this movie
","I knew very little about Johnny Cash and pretty much nothing about June Carter Cash before seeing 'Walk The Line.' I was aware June had died recently, and that Johnny died soon after of a broken heart (but not before releasing an excruciatingly beautiful version of NIN's 'Hurt,' along with an equally waterworks-inducing music video). As a music and movie addict and a sucker for a great love story, these tiny nuggets of information provided enough incentive for me to shell out the $9 ticket fee.With that said, this movie gave me goosebumps like very few movies ever have. From the pounding bass line permeating Folsom Prison at the beginning of the film to the closing shot acknowledging Johnny and June's recent deaths, director James Mangold takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster, albeit one you never want to end. Aside from two or three slow points, the movie flows well and remains engaging throughout its entirety.Let's move on to the acting, shall we? I'm not exaggerating when I say that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon both light the screen on fire. Phoenix almost always gives great performances, but Witherspoon's transformation from cute girl-next-door to Jaw-Droppingly Talented Dramatic Actress is a revelation on the level of Elisabeth Shue in 'Leaving Las Vegas' (minus the whole hooker thing). And despite (probably false) reports that the two actors supposedly didn't have the friendliest off-camera relationship, you would never know it from watching them on screen together. Their chemistry is off the charts. Watching Phoenix and Witherspoon sing to each other in front of thousands of people, it's crystal clear how Johnny and June's love story inspired someone to make a movie about it.The music is pretty amazing as well. Phoenix doesn't sound exactly like Johnny by any means, but he sounds similar enough to believably and respectfully inhabit Cash. Witherspoon herself is great, with a sweet voice just this side of twangy, which manages not to turn off audience members like myself who generally don't listen to country.I really can't say enough positive things about this film. You should be standing in line right now waiting to buy tickets. Or call Fandango, whatever. Just go. Now.",10,0,2,28 November 2005
