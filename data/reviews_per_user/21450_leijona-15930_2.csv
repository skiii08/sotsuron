Hereditary," Ridiculous movie, I can't find anything good in this...
","The film has all the old cliches of horror movies (spiritualism, teen parties, a cottage in the middle of forest on the mountains, slightly deformed weird child etc.) and not really anything original. The plot was a complete mess and just got worse as the movie went on. The movie achieved its climax quite fast and after the first 30 minutes or so I mostly hoped that something a bit more interesting would happen - but it didn't.I got scared - a bit - just once during the film, when something was suddenly thrown on the screen. There were similar 'whoaa silence is interrupted by lighting fast boogieman on the screen' moments several times, but as I said, I got scared only once... Acting was rather dull, too.I'm not sure if the ant infested dead bodies should have been scary. But nowadays people see the real thing - deformed bodies, bloody bodies, burned bodies etc. - really easily in internet, so that kind of special effects don't really have any real potential to add suspension to any movie nowadays... maybe in the 1970s those would have been cool.Maybe, just maybe, the movie get some additional fame later on, because it was just so ridiculous...",1,1,2,20 July 2018
Interstellar," Utter disappointment
","I just saw the 70 mm version of the film (I hadn't seen it before) and I had high hopes of it. After all, in many reviews it was compared to the Holy Grail of science fiction, Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey. But instead of cosmological Beethoven I saw a rather ordinary rock'n roll space movie.Sure, many scientific facts were correct and special effects ok, but the athmosphere of the movie collapsed to the normal cliches of Hollywood movies. The hero was a rough corn farmer turned into a space cowboy. The end was underlining and giving all the answers instead of rising any questions. Driving of the space ships seemed to be rather easy feat, and surely you got those chases with them with some explosions, too...Perhaps the worst thing in the movie was the complete failure of painting the space as a huge place where we are just tiny grains of sand. In Kubrick's Space Odyssey even the journey to Saturn was an extreme journey taking the whole movie to complete. In Interstellar humans are jumping to other galaxies in just minutes of movie time. In other solar systems the journey between planets is not even worth showing... What's the hurry? Instead of describing the feelings of crew in the middle of nothing there seems to be always a great hurry to the next scene of action...After a couple of hours I almost fell asleep. Only when our space cowboy entered the black hole did the movie turned into something of bit interesting, but just when it would have been a terrific spot to end the movie it just went on until the ridiculous end.",3,3,4,11 November 2018
