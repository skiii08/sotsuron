The Blair Witch Project," pretty good
","pretty solid independent cinema. the movie gives chills in certain situations, but the last ten minutes are what give me favorable praise for it. the way the characters were dehumanized by the woods was very believable, but the ending is what truly makes the film stand out. i think the film industry has overhyped this one so much because of the film's concept more than the quality of the film itself, but that's understandable when rubbish tongue-in-cheek horror movies (the faculty, scream, h20, the haunting) keep filling our theatres. so..i recommend the movie, but lower your expectations. it's not the scarriest ever.",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," respect their authority!
","raunchy, tasteless, and biting irony all at the same time. but unlike a guy named austin, cartman, stan, kenny, and kyle deliver some genuine funny schtuff. AND the movie delivers a clear message about censorship, free will, parenting, etc, satirizing musicals and scenes from popular movies in the process (clockwork orange, saving private ryan, butch cassidy and the sundance kid, i think). if you have never seen the show, you will probably be repulsed and ready to scream. if you have seen the show before, you will love it, for the most part. too many musicals make it a little too long, and the cussing gets a little old. but by the end of the movie, the message is loud and clear. IF YOU ARE UNDER 16, YOU SHOULD NOT SEE THIS. you will be lost or not completely understand some of the adult situations. a little disappointed that chef, officer barbrady, and jesus were not involved in the story since they are typically active characters in the tv show. otherwise, very solid movie that will leave people howling. demands repeated viewing. can't wait for the video.",Null,0,0,16 July 1999
American Beauty," sticks with you
","finally saw this after all the attention it's received. when i saw the trailer for it recently, I had the feeling that I had seen this movie before, 'the ice storm', which is one of my recent favorites. it has been compared to 'storm', but this movie is not as dark and twisted. it's more about loneliness and insecurity than sexual confusion. the characters in 'beauty' are also funnier and more redemptive. you feel cleansed at the conclusion of the movie. spacey reminds one of a young deniro. brilliant actor. bening and the supporting cast members also held their own, even though some of their personalities we've encountered before in other movies. it should garner acting nominations by the academy, but the relationship between ricky and jane was very predictable from the start, taking the writing a notch down in my mind. still an excellent movie that deserves the attention it's receiving.",Null,0,0,2 October 1999
Being John Malkovich," whacked-out
","First of all, i'm surprised that this movie is even playing in town. we never get anything independent, but we do get the double jeopardys and the american pies in every theatre around town. second of all, i'll have to see it as many times i can before it gets shoved out of town. this movie definitely is everything you heard earlier: hilarious, thought-provoking, bizzare, chock full of ideas and themes, and least of all, brilliant. all the actors are terrific. ebert is right with this one. this has to be nominated for a best picture come oscar time. but it probably won't simply because not that many people will see it. i don't want to talk about it in case of spoiling it, but just GO SEE IT.",Null,0,0,7 November 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," interesting; but no dr. strangelove
","finally, about three weeks ago, kubrick gives the film world his final opus, eyes wide shut. after seeing it a couple of times, i enjoyed the film, but it's definitely not as good as dr. strangelove, 2001, full metal jacket, or a clockwork orange. it's very reminiscent of barry lyndon. the stunning set designs, color, photography, lighting, and glacial pace. the grainy film was interesting, too. it made you feel as if you just woke up from a nap and are looking around. cruise was serviceable, as he appears in virtually every minute of the film. but at times he seemed to try too hard for melodrama. kidman was very impressive as his wife, and should have been more involved in the film. the editing felt uneven towards the end of the film, and there was one scene in which the shadow of a crew man entered the picture. surprising errors from a kubrick film, since he is notorious for his meticulousness. if he was still alive, i'm sure these would have been improved on. the ending felt forced and abrupt, especially the pool scene where they tried to answer some of the questions posed. the movie would have been more effective if there was more evidence of distrust between the couple. the message kubrick is implying about infidelity may seem dated to many, especially in the late nineties. some darkly funny moments that seem to poke fun at the media who question cruise's sexuality e.g. college homophobes, hotel clerk, hooker's friend. and last, it was just 20 minutes too long, but i never really felt bored. in conclusion, eyes wide shut should be seen by any serious film buff. i recommend 'after hours' by scorsese, which depicts another man lost in a surreal sexual underworld. it's funnier and more poignant.p.s. pay attention to the scene where cruise is in the coffee house. you'll be surprised at who you see sitting.",8,0,0,9 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," good movie
","this movie has been the talk of the film world the past two weeks, especially for the ending. i will sound like a broken record, but it's true. willis and haley joel osmont had a terrific relationship as doctor and patient. neither of them has ever been better, and they may possibly never be. only two minor complaints i have: i wish the female characters had just a LITTLE more depth and i felt the pacing was just a little too slow. but it didn't really change my feeling of the movie. well-written and directed also. i have one question about the emergency room scene? was the director making a cameo as the doctor? if anyone knows, e-mail me. thanks.",Null,0,0,12 August 1999
The Thin Red Line," in due time.............
","excellent, resonating movie. the polar reactions of hate or love to this movie definitely make the thin red line intriguing in itself. some movies gaining this reaction e.g. pulp fiction, fargo, 2001: a space odyssey, rushmore typically hold up under repeated viewing, and even turn some initial naysayers into fans. all these filmmakers had the guts to put out an unconventional piece of film, not visuals that shove emotion down our throat, waiting for us to say we're sorry and that americans are the only people that can supersede the evils of war (spielberg). film is an art, a movie is set up to entertain or inform. that's the main difference between 'the thin red line' and 'saving private ryan'. art has to be carefully observed to see all the nuances, and when you gain a general understanding of a piece and what it means to the artist, you feel more deeply gratified. i've seen the movie twice, and found some different things that i missed the first time. don't get me wrong, i liked saving private ryan. the action sequences in saving private ryan have opened up groundbreaking possibilities in the action of the war film genre, similar to how star wars brought in special effects and style back in '77. but i've seen that twice too, and i think that's more than enough. usually spielberg movies don't hold up after seeing them a couple times. some people feel that star wars is the reason for the decline in the number of quality films, emphasizing eye candy and style over character development, existentialism, and human nature, which the phantom menace shamelessly does. whether saving private ryan does the same for the war film genre remains to be seen.",Null,0,1,6 July 1999
