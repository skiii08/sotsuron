Mission: Impossible III," Dull, Bloated, Disappointment.
",Not even worth the matin√©e price. I'm now convinced that critics have to be getting paid off by the studios. The positive reviews that this film has received made me excited to see it. Did they really juice up a dried out franchise? A non-stop action good time? This movie was just so damn bad on multi levels. What Action!? Shaking Michael Bay style camera work where you can't make out anything. That is not an action sequence. This flick is shot so dark you can't see whats going on. When is the Dept.of Consumer Affairs going to step in and offer people refunds on bad movies? The audience that I saw this with was So ticked off . By the 3 reel the screen heckles began. Great. Another 2 hrs (and cash) wasted.It's going to be a long Summer.,2,2,6,5 May 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Jaw-Dropping Terror.
","It's all about the zombies...Pure and simple. And they are truly scary...Thousands of zombies...Brutal as it should be. OFF THE HOOK zombie attacks!    Unreal images and sound design. (The screening was in a great place) It works on a master horror film level. A  homage to the orginal 1978 version in every way. Relentless from the opening to the end. (Let me just say the zombies tear you apart as your on your back, kicking like a turtle, Voice box being torn out while your screaming) What a screening!! To hear a packed house scream again made the night. This film will be considered a classic down the road and will be a huge success.",10,1,1,6 March 2004
The Mist," Fantastic tale of terror. Best film of the year. PARENTS DO NOT BRING KIDS!!
","Blew me away, along with the rest of the audience. When the sirens sound and the camera moves, The film kicks into gear... Low, High, Overdrive.Great pacing+Great acting= Masterpiece.SFX are used to forward the story, Sound design was the best I have heard in any movie period.This film is for adults!I saw parents with children and the kids were crying softly behind me. Bringing a 6 to 12 year old to a film like this is so wrong. They will be terrified with nightmares for god knows how long.Parents PLEASE DO NOT bring your Kids. They will be scared for life. Truly they will. Its a hard 'R' film.",10,5,11,23 November 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," A Post Modern Masterpiece! So Well Done!
","This film was fantastic! From a technical level, as good looking a film as I have ever seen. The editing and pacing is breathless. The sound design was coming from everywhere in the theater. Relentless action. As exciting a film experience I've had since 1986's 'Aliens'. But also as much loopy zombie fun as 1985's 'Life Force'. A true new modern classic and dare I say it, One of the best films of 2004. Milla Jovovich running lost in a deserted city as every pay telephone on the street starts to ring is a new classic moment in modern cinema. Man, the majority of the film critics miss the boat on this one.Hope George Romero's up coming 'Land of the Dead' packs the same kinetic style as this trippy flick.",10,3,6,17 November 2004
The Sixth Sense," Shattering-Moving-One of the summers finest entries.
","Just left a sneak preview. A sold out show. A packed house. When the lights came on EVERYONE was weeping. I thought I was the only one trying to hide the sweeping emotional pull that this movie delivered. Yes its spooky (Very). Yes it's a slick production, a summer movie. But THE SIXTH SENSE unmasks itself in an ending that is totally unexpected and shattering.The bad news, a glaring technical flaw about twenty minutes into the film (A boom microphone is CLEARLY visible in TWO shots) that drew a roar of heckles from the audience and came very close to wrecking the movie up to that point.
Even with this flaw, the film was STILL able to deliver a knock out-have to see it again to get the full effect-experience.Makes me wonder...How could the film makers not SEE THAT MICROPHONE!It looked ready to pop Bruce Willis on the head! It's hanging close to dead center of the screen for what seems forever! One scene, Willis ACTUALLY SAYS 'I feel like I have something hanging over my mind'. Yea, the boom microphone! Could they not re-shoot the scenes? Crop the picture? Re-move it digitally? They were simple scenes in what was happening (Room Conversation). If someone knows, drop a line.For this reason ONLY I give it a 9 out of what would have been a well deserved 10.
See it with someone you love. You'll know why when the lights come up.",10,0,0,31 July 1999
