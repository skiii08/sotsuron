Sucker Punch," Misleading Commercials
","If you have no knowledge about this movie going in you would probably expect an action packed thrill ride, based on the commercials. The commercials really sell this one short though, they make it seem like the movie will be centered around action, and that just isn't true. The movie does contain spectacular sequences of action that will satisfy anyone's hunger for action, but it has a story too. The story is the main part of the movie, not action, as the commercials may lead you to believe. It takes a true master to be able to balance action and story as elegantly as they are balanced in this movie. Zack Snyder is a master of action, we all know 300, but I honestly didn't expect such a compelling story in a movie directed by him, but I was pleasantly surprised. I recommend seeing this movie, you will be surprised too.",9,8,17,29 March 2011
