The Blair Witch Project," Hype Hurts a Decent But Unspectacular Film
","I applaud the unique, un-cliche-ridden approach that the filmmakers took with their 'Blair Witch Project'.  It is very refreshing to see a horror film that doesn't breakdown into all the predictable and ridiculous situations ('Don't back into that dark room alone!!')  There is nothing particularly ORIGINAL about 'Blar Witch', although it is an unusual approach and one that is rarely done, let alone done well.However, the hype surrounding this movie leaves me baffled.  For one, it really hurt to know certain details beforehand (these details have been crammed down our throats via TV and radio for a month or so, now).  There are so few points in the movie where something creepy actually happens, that to know of them before the lights have even gone down strips them of any eeriness.  But more than that, it created expectations for this film which were unrealistic.  Is it a good film?  Yes, if you can technically call it a 'film'.  Is it a GREAT film?  Not by a long shot.The movie is more creepy to think about than it is scary to watch, and I don't regret seeing it.  Just think twice before you join the mobs downtown who are waiting for hours to get in.",7,1,1,25 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Disenchantment of Star Wars
","Keep in mind while reading my comments that I am - and always will be - an avid Star Wars fan.  The first three films helped define my childhood and have stayed with me into early adulthood.  The themes and the sheer FUN of the trilogy are truly rare in this day and age.That being said, 'The Phantom Menace' is perhaps one of the worst films I have ever had to sit through, and a disgrace to both Star Wars and Lucasfilm.  A true embarrassment, I was near tears through most of the film. Seeing it on opening night, I was thrilled as the trademark intro script scrolled up the screen.  Everything that followed was truly horrifying, starting with the most ridiculously stereotypical Asian alien bad guys this side of Ming the Merciless.  Add to that a completely dreadful script, way too many effects, no discernable plot line, and dreary 'action' sequences, and you have yourself a real stinker.  And I won't waste any space talking about the apocalyptic disaster that is Jar Jar Binks.Poor Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and Natalie Portman!!  Three of the finest actors to grace the screen today, and they have nothing at all to work with. Meanwhile all the dialogue goes to Jar Jar and Anakin, played awfully by Jake Lloyd.  Sidenote:  Am I the only one concerned with the fact that through the whole movie everyone calls the future Darth Vader 'Annie'???Darth Maul would be a formidable villain, assuming, of course, that he had any lines, which he doesn't.  He is silent during his entire lightsaber duel with Neeson and McGregor, eliminating the verbal duel that was at the heart of Vader's fights with Luke in the original series.  His role seems detached and his presence does not seem to effect the sequence of events in the least.And let me say this:  there are too many effects.  They are not even that impressive, not for a lack of technical wizardry, but because the action they portray is either confusing or non-existent, and there is none of the tension in any of the battle scenes which is even close to that found in its technologically ancient granddaddy, 'A New Hope'.  In fact, considering the technology available, the scenario of the battle scenes seems pretty ho-hum-ish if not trite.There is not enough room to write all the terrible things about this movie. They even reduce the Force to microscopic organisms that live in the bloodstream.  This was the most disappointing movie experience I have ever had.  Mr. Lucas, if you or any of your people read this, please take to heart the ramblings of a disgruntled but faithful fan in order to make Episode II much better.",1,445,805,27 May 1999
Glory," one of the great all time war movies
","Without mincing words, 'Glory' is one of the greatest war movies of all time.  It shines in every category, with no weaknesses (except maybe Carey Elwes).  Mathew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, and especially Denzel Washington all give magnificent performances.  The cinematography is terrific.  While it is not as impressive technically as 'Saving Private Ryan', the script is much tighter, and it is overall a better picture.  How this movie wasn't even NOMINATED for Best Picture is beyond me.See this movie.  You'll love it.",10,0,0,19 September 1998
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Poor narrative choices and pacing kill a monster of a movie
","Off the bat it must be said in Peter Jackson's defense that the Lord of the Rings is simply too large and sprawling a tale to condense into even three three-hour films.  While I have read and enjoyed the books, I am in no way a LOTR fanatic, and was more than prepared for changes to the book in order to streamline the story. That out of the way, The Fellowship of the Ring makes some bizarre narrative choices which ruin what could have been a tremendous accomplishment.For some reason, Jackson and company have decided to spend far too much time on the build-up to the forging of the actual fellowship.  A good half-hour is wasted in Hobbiton, and the slow trek to Rivendell eats up a good hour and a half of screen time.  This part of the film lags badly, and is equally hampered by some poor story-telling decisions, such as: why is Saruman suddenly working FOR Sauron?  If you're going to add more to Arwen's character, why make it so sudden, random, and pointless?  And most importantly, why undermine the mystery surrounding Aragorn?  This last point is the most egregious error, in that the actual lineage of Aragorn is in question through the original trilogy, whereas here it is one of the very first things we learn about him.By the time Jackson gets to the actual journey of the Fellowship, he has run out of screen time, and so the actual traversing of Middle Earth's painstakingly described landscapes is condensed into several swooping longshots cut back-to-back.  There is no time to become attached to the Fellowship before their eventual break-up.  This is a serious story-telling error on the part of the filmmakers.  It is here, during their travels, that there was an opportunity to flesh out the cast of nine characters, as well as divulge the exposition surrounding the origin of the Ring of Power more fluidly and naturally.  Instead, Jackson has decided to cram the entire backstory of the Ring into a very awkward and hoky prologue.Other pet peeves which are more subjective are the irritating overuse of slow-motion and the heavy-handed urgency which is given to every scene (thereby undercutting any actual dramatic moments as the story reaches its climax).  The film's score is dreadfully overwrought and completely washes out the incredible sound design.  Astoundingly there are points where it even drowns out the dialogue (not that this is a bad thing, considering much of the chatter that goes on).On the plus side, most of the acting is quite good, esp. Ian McKellan as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Sam Gangee, and Sean Bean as Boromir.  Many of the other characters suffer from underwritten parts, and Cate Blanchett is given very little to work with as the Lady Galadriel.  Most of the settings are beautifully rendered, although there is a bit too much CGI at work in many of the larger sequences.  A necessary evil in most cases, considering the scope of the books.Overall, the film was a big let down.  There is a breath of hope for The Two Towers, however, inasmuch as the characters are split up, which should allow for personalities to develop unhindered by the sheer number of characters onscreen in this first chapter of the trilogy.  While expectations are now tempered, I have faith that the two follow-ups in the series will at least be enjoyable romps.  Still, given the efforts put into The Fellowship of the Ring, a few smarter narrative decisions could have made for a breathtaking spectacle.  Pity.",6,1,4,23 December 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's Swan Song an Ugly Ducklnig
","I love 2001.  I love Full Metal Jacket.  I like A Clockwork Orange (for the most part).  Here's what I don't love or like:  Eyes Wide Shut.  What a stinker.  Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't completely awful or shoddily put together.  It was just far too long, and ultimately misguided.  What starts out as a semi-surreal exploration of sex, the subconscious, and the merging of these things degenerates (after the infamous orgy scene) into a dull, plodding, unsuspenseful thriller that peters out rather than builidng tension.  The final explanatory scene with Sidney Pollack deflates what little mystery there might be left.  It is a dreadfully generic way for such a pioneer as Kubrick to end what started out as a promising film.  Tom Cruise is decent in the lead role, but unfortunately, Nicole Kidman is wooden.  At least when she has her clothes on and is talking.  Kubrick's visual style is as breathtaking as ever, especially during the costuemed orgy and whenever he lovingly frames Kidman's perfect body, but the script is bad, and some points downright laughable.  Too bad this is the last taste of Kubrick we'll ever have.",4,1,2,26 August 1999
The Iron Giant," Brilliant, Touching Tale
","Can it be that the best film of 1999 is....a CARTOON?  I would have to say yes.  This is perhaps the best animated feature in the past 10 years (or maybe even further back than that.)  What makes it so great?  First of all, it is a visual marvel.  The film contained some of the smoothest animation ever, with CG elements flawlessly incorporated into the traditional elements.  Vibrant colors and wonderfully expressive characters make the movie much more than a cartoon - it is merely animated life. 	The story is a gem.  The hypothetical question 'what if a gun had a soul?' lies at the heart of the plot, and issues, of spirituality, redemption, and sacrifice make the plot much more substantive than anything Disney churns out to make a quick buck.  There are parts where I actually teared up.  Yes, I admit it, a strapping young man such as myself actually cries at films if they deserve it, and this one does.  The fact that very few people actually saw this film is very upsetting to me.  It is the perfect movie for parents to take their children to, because not only will their children be wildly entertained by the endearing, larger-than-life title character, but they as parents will also enjoy a rich movie experience - thanks to a script which pokes fun at Cold War hysteria and propaganda, among other things. 	This review might ramble, but let's wrap it up like this:  This is a fabulous movie for the young and old.  If you are a parent, PLEASE show this movie to your children.  And if you don't have kids, watch it for yourself. You won't regret it.",10,1,2,2 February 2000
The Deer Hunter," Real people in Reel life
","Michael Cimino's 'The Deerhunter' is, quite simply, a masterpiece that ranks as one of the greatest films of all time.  The strength of this movie does not lie in its subject matter (as we all know, Vietnam movies are a dime a dozen), but in the presentation.  The characters are all *real* people. Conversations are natural and fluid, and actions are believable because the characters have been portrayed as capable of carrying them out.  Also, they *look* like real people.  They sweat, they are rumpled, etc. All performances in the movie are wonderful, standing out are Christopher Walken, John Savage, John Cazale, and of course, the MAN, Robert De Niro. 
The movie flows very naturally, while the plot structure is not wholly open, it does not have the artificial, closed structure that is commonplace in Hollywood movies.  This allows you to accept the film as a real course of events, 'real' life which becomes 'reel' life.  The movie is long and at points slow, but this is not a weakness.  The strength of the film is that it does not simply manipulate emotions to elicit a response.  It is subtle and touching, and rather than being shown how you should feel, you come to an understanding with the characters on your own.  You empathize, not just sympathize.  You have to be in the mood to sit through 'The Deerhunter', but if you do, you won't regret it.",10,0,0,18 September 1998
