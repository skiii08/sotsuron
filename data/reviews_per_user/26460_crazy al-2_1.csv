Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wow
","I have been waiting for this day for the last 4 years.  To make it short, it was worth the wait.  I am as big a Star Wars fan as they come, and I can say that this was one of the greatest movies of all time.  The critics can say all they want.  But, to the little people like us, who enter the theater to seek entertainment, and not for a job, this movie takes us back to that galaxy far, far away.  It takes us to worlds that are alien yet strangely familiar.  We did not go to the theater to analyze why Jake Lloyd says 'yippee' all of the time.  We went because there is a little Star Wars in all of us.  It is one thing that people from around the world can relate to. It has become more than we ever expected and I was privileged to see it. Now if you haven't seen it yet, go experience it for yourself. May the Force be with you.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
