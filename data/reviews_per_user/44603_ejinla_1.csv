Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Darth Maul is no Vader
","I really missed the presence of a Vader like villain.  Darth Maul doesn't hold a candle to Vader and as a result the film is unbalanced toward the silly side.  The movie is a visual feast, but the story doesn't entertain adults.  Still a must see though.",6,0,1,20 May 1999
