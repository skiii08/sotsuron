Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3: Interesting, But With Mispalced Humor
","Be Warned: Spoilers ARE included.Iron Man 1 was a wonderful light film with lots of laughs. Iron Man 3 however didn't do much for me. I thought that the humor was misplaced and even if some of it was entertaining, i wasn't very amused because I was so tense. I just felt that this was much more serious and dark. The fact that Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) could breathe fire was absolutely insane and I thought it was much too outlandish. I suppose the whole 'Extremis' idea didn't really appeal to me. I thought it was much too outlandish for my taste. The first 2 Iron Man films were strange perhaps but almost plausible and maybe even believable. However, this one is totally impossible. When Pepper Potts falls into the great pit of fire, I think it would have been better for her either to die or to have been caught by Tony before. It was WAY too predictable that she would live and I think the best endings should be bittersweet. They shouldn't all end happily ever after and even though I really like her character, I might have enjoyed the film more if she had not lived. Anyway, i rated this a 6 and I hope some of you agree with my viewpoints. Thank you.",10,1,2,12 May 2013
