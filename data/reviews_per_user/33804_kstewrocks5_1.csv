The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," i'm dreaming or something ? finally a real VAMPIRES/Werewolves movie
","I just saw this movie last night and wanted to take a few before saying anything on it. It is a very moving and powerful movie that shows the power of loss and love This is a great one , this is the best twilight so far the haters can say what ever they want i don't give a .... this movie amazing i thought eclipse was the best one but no breaking dawn is the best , mix of romance and horror at the same time also the acting was great from Rob and Kristen . Taylor Lautner was pretty good in the beginning but he failed almost in the whole movie , Kristen did an amazing job in this movie she was so emotional and very very good even the haters should admit it . especially at the birth although this movie got some critics from some clueless reviewers like the potter-fans that have no idea about the movie . this is why i hated Harry Potter because the critics are so fair with Harry potter but when its came to twilight this gave the movies 0/10 like always , this proves that they got paid to hate on every twilight movie actually i read the reviews in RT and then i went to see the movie with a bad idea about it because of them but this time they failed i really enjoyed the movie and i give it A+ and i'm a guy , this is the best twilight despite the critics .. congratulation for Bill and the twilight fans and the cast",10,12,51,16 November 2011
