The Mask," A movie for everyone
","I disagree with the other reviewer, when I first saw this movie I was 16 and I thought it was brilliant. I am 22 now and I still like it. The only reason you should avoid this movie is if you dislike Jim Carrey's style of overacting and being silly (I know some do). Otherwise he is great in this and without him I don't think the concept would work at all. There is a balance of story with all the comedy and while it isn't a life changing movie it is fun and well made, the effects are great for a film of it's age and stand up OK even 10 years later. The characters are ideal, the two detectives are the perfect double act and Cameron Diaz is both incredibly beautiful and talented in her first big role. In summary, I think adults can enjoy the silliness and the comedy as much the kids and the plot, acting and effects knit the whole lot together really well.",9,0,0,20 February 2005
