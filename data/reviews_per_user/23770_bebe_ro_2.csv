Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I am amazed by your comments
","I red a lot of comments here (not all of them, of course) and I am amazed by the viewers incapacity of understanding what the movie really tried to be.The movie is NOT about how a citizen of Kazahstan reacts when arriving in US. An it's not about the way that the citizen of Kazahstan actually live.It is about how the US citizen would think that such a stranger would react in front of them. And the way that the stranger would see their American Way.When Borat says at dinner that his sister is a prostitute, the important thing to see is the reaction of the other people, not the statement itself.The whole movie is NOT about Borat, is about the way that America reacts at the sight of such character. The reaction of the crowd when he says that Kazahstan fully supports the war against terrorism and the Iraq invasion. And the same crowd that is stunned by Borat's subsequent affirmation about killing all the people of Iraq.This movie is a mirror that Sascha Baron Cohen has placed in front of the people from US and A. And if you don't see it, then I might say we live in a very dangerous world. Idiocracy is close.I laughed with bitter tears...",9,0,6,11 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," which Spidey is this one?
","Well, the movie didn't pass the class for me...Spidey has no sense of danger. He gets kicked with no warning from his 6th sense throughout the whole movie.The characters keep showing their real faces like we're dumb and we quickly forget who's who.For me, Spidey is a nerd that got spider powers, says jokes from time to time and beats up his enemies mainly by using his brain, rather than his muscles.And this movie is almost nothing about that. All I saw was useless violence, stupid and senseless romance and bad acting. Ah, I saw some good special effects, but that's only a tool, you know...",4,2,5,8 May 2007
