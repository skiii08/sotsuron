Mission: Impossible III," Action All the Way
","As an action thriller, it entertains you right from the start. There are a few moments, which are totally unbelievable, but this film is in the same genre as 007. Don't take it too seriously, just enjoy! Just like True Lies, MI3 leaves James Bond standing.The only thing that lets this movie down is the typical happy/clappy ending you get in almost every American made movie. Its as if Americans are scared to be confronted with the darker side of life or is it the Hollywood movie houses? Forget about Tom's private life and what he believes in. It has nothing to do with his movie talent. He's proved once again that he has the golden touch and as long as he entertains, I'll keep going to see his movies.",8,2,4,20 May 2006
Inglourious Basterds," A Very Entertaining and Compulsive Viewing Experience
","I didn't have any expectations when I went to see this film, but I was impressed how Tarantino took the WW2 story and turned it into his own fictional portrayal of the Nazis in France.While demonstrating the evil of the Nazis, mainly via the great acting from Christoph Waltz, he introduces a level of dark humour that flows in and out of the film very well. It's like eating a fine meal and finding a new taste in every bite you take....making you want more and more. 2.5 hours goes quickly and you feel stuffed, but very satisfied..As always with these type of films, you become sceptical with the marketing bandwagon used to promote the film. But, in this case it was justified. Brad Pitt does a great job of being the gung ho American leader of a group of professionals sent into France to kill Nazis in Tarantino's realistic style. Melanie laurent plays the lady who earlier escapes a close encounter with the Nazis who kill her whole family. The story used show how she gets her revenge is an original idea for me and just adds to the magic of the film.I saw this film in Sweden and the film is a mixture of French, German and English. Even though my Swedish is not perfect, I managed to follow the Swedish subtitles for the non-English conversations and it had no affect on my enjoyment of the film. In fact at the start of the film, the languages used are part of the film, which is cleverly used by Christoph Waltz as the Nazi general.So, go and see this film. Even if you're not a Tarantino film, you will enjoy the story, but you may have to cover your eyes for some scenes if you don't like that kind of thing. But, really, those scenes compliment the film and are much less than in the likes of Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction. In fact in felt like the films I grew up with where the acting and the storyline made the film, not the special effects. The filming style reminded me of the older generation films gone by. It is one of the few films I have attended where people applauded at the end. That says it all in a nutshell.",9,3,10,30 August 2009
