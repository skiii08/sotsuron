Vertigo," Boy, was I obsessed!
","<ul><li>possible spoilers-</li></ul>Does anyone need another comment on Vertigo? I don't think so. I'll be brief, sort of. Vertigo is the story of an illusion, of something that cannot be had. Scottie falls in love with a woman that doesn't exist so he's bound to lose her every time he falls for her, chases her or simply tries to make somebody else into her. It's not unrequited love or doomed love, it's just love, period, the idea of love, there's nothing else because there is no one to love, just Scottie entrapped in this sexual obsession with no object that can never be satisfied and from which there is no escape. I think that's Vertigo, sort of.So what about Kim Novak? Miss Novak is Hitchcock's MacGuffin, the master's bait, the poisoned ghost he gives to Scottie to feed his imagination but at the other end of the ghost there's a woman, Judy, and she suffers the consequences. If there's a haunted soul in Vertigo is not that of Madeleine but Scottie's. Madeleine is the haunting ghost.Vertigo is a very strange movie for Hitchcock. The plot has more than one hole. Vertigo makes sense for the eyes rather than the ears. But not always in a rational way, not if you think of Novak's make-up. The Carlotta subplot, for instance, are we to believe that Hichtcock is making a supernatural thriller with a Shyamalan twist? If we go along with everything is because we look through Scottie's eyes. To show us what Scottie sees Hitchcock displays a surreal feast worthy of Bunuel accompanied by an aesthetic refinement that would make Visconti eat his heart out. He was no stranger to either surrealism or elegance but I don't think he had ever abandoned himself to his visual instincts in this way. And he had a couple of master cards up his sleeve: a devastatingly beautiful Kim Novak and a peerless James Stewart. Stewart never was a heartthrob, he was the 'everyman'. Could some 50s hunk or some contemporary 'everyman' have done what Stewart did in Vertigo? I don't think so. He makes accessible what is twisted, rich what is baseless.",10,3,6,9 September 2004
Collateral," not the best Mann, but still a man to watch
","I agree with all those reviews that pan Collateral's script, there's simply nothing in it that you haven't seen before and that you didn't expect. Worse still, you expected it crisper, taut. It's hard to find enough tension going on between Vincent and Max because there's no interplay between Vincent and Max, there's Vincent playing with Max, poor Max is taking it up the derrière most of the time.How Max can manage such docility is hard to get, because Vincent, after all, is a pro but not a brute, he's a gentleman round the edges, which ends up marring the whole thing. Neither fish nor meat. The actors are good, though and although Mann doesn't seem particularly concerned with improving the script's underdevelopment he's got enough talent in him to make it a watchable and occasionally warm thriller. And there's LA... Never been there but the mann sure looks at her with a lover's eye but does he trust his woman?",6,0,0,30 August 2004
Before Sunset," late magic in Paris sunset
","At first these two seem too successful and idealistic and cliché to care much about them. It's kind of sweet, but kind of naive too. So I said to myself, this whole thing needs pathos. Then the pathos came but I couldn't muster much emotion either, so I apportioned the blame to the director, the writers and the actors in equal shares, which are basically three shares , Linklater, Hawke and Delpy. And then, when I didn't expect anything else, came the magic: Julie Delpy sings a waltz, and it stays with the movie for the few minutes that are left. I don't know if that's worth the price of admission but it's kind of mean to regret having paid it.",6,2,6,13 October 2004
