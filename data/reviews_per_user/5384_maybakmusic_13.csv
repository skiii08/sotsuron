Sucker Punch," Better, and smarter, than they say
","I think you should know, that actually these types of things happen a lot; corruption in state or federal funded facilities, coping strategies/defense mechanisms. But one thing that is very rare, is a young person (the antagonist) having as much power and influence as the dude in this movie had. That is unheard of. I am sure the writer of the movie has just never been in the system before, or just knew he had to make the character young for the movie to work.As u know, the girl has fantasies as a coping strategy as she decides to escape the looney bin. The story alternates between the fantasy viewpoint of her escape, and the real life version of the escape. The movie is just strange. I get it, but I think the fantasy view was just too far fetched and irrelevant. The fantasy also left some questions unanswered. I think the general idea of the movie had potential, but it got lost somewhere in production.This movie is better than people say. I think most people also aren't aware of how common psychosis and defense mechanisms are. That also played into why so many people didn't like it.Give it a chance, it was worth watching, but there is merit to the criticism you have heard.",7,2,4,1 December 2013
Source Code," Just another flick to me
","This is a movie about data extraction from the human mind. When a person goes into a coma (for example), technology and professionals use a technique to gather information from a person who is unable to communicate. The information is gathered through tapping into the mind, to communicate with the mind of the person. A simulated world is created for the subject to walk around in and interact with (think of it like Avatar, but for people who are physically disabled throughout the entire body, except their mind). Then, the person has to accomplish some goal, because doing so is the only way their mind can communicate with the extractors. This is in part because they barely remember anything. So the problem solving, ends with a solution that is actually what the mind was trying to tell the extractors.But, it was just a decent movie to me. The ending is anticlimactic. It was also trying to have a twist, but for the wrong reasons. The writer was trying to be cute, rather than entertaining. The movie is kind of another 'protagonist reliving the same day over and over until they do something right' story. It was like the writer realized that it actually wasn't too unique after all, so they tried to make the ending bizarre. It just came across as an awkward movie. I think this could have been better. But it is decent, and worth watching once or twice. I feel that an average rating of 7.4 on IMDb, is too high for this movie.",7,0,3,29 November 2013
World War Z," Big budget Hollywood meets cool zombie flick
","I was surprised at how good this movie was, and how much it exceeded my expectations. Pretty boy Brad Pitt was in it, but other than that, I thought it was one of the best movies of the year. Definitely the best graphics for a zombie movie ever.The movie is 2 hours, which I think more movies should be now a days. The scope of how big budget the movie was, mixed with the fact that it has just as good a story as the best zombie movies ever, was what makes this worth seeing. Seeing entire cities being burned and overrun by hordes of zombies, has never actually looked convincing. All other attempts at this scenery pale in comparison.I really like Zombie movies, and vampire movies, and sci fi and such. As long as they are really good (examples off the top of my head: Bram Stoker's Dracula, Elysium, Minority Report, Alien series, Dusk Til Dawn). This is right up there with those movies.I honestly believe this movie will creep up in acceptance over a few years, unfortunately. People will have trouble opening up to it, but over time, they will give it a chance and see how great it is.",9,2,3,13 November 2013
Pacific Rim," Big Badass Blockbuster in your face!
","I watched this because it looked badass; I'll be honest. First off, let me say that this movie has some of the best graphics and visuals of any film in history to date. The fight scenes in this, during 2013, are like when you watched Jurassic Park in the mid 90s. It's just so good, so amazing, on a godlike scale, that it gets at least an 8/10 fresh out the gate.The story is pretty cool, but the family angle is played at a little bit, so some cheesy stuff is in the mix (girl like boy, boy has a bully rival, boy fight rival for girl, boy get girl). But it actually is badass how the overall story is made somehow acceptable. It is like Avatar - super far fetched, but everything is logical and in order, so you completely buy it.Everything was amazing, you have to see it if you like any movies at all. Only reason I didn't give it a 10, was because the writing could perhaps have been a little better. There was a scene with a 5-10 minute hand to hand battle between a giant alien monster, and one of the human guided Voltrons. Blow for blow, it is like a Mike Tyson fight. And then literally, when Voltron is about to lose the fight, one of the Voltron pilots says something like 'Oh yea, we have this giant sword that can pop out of the arm'.... and it does, and they kill the alien with one swing... Things like that, are not necessary evils that blockbusters with simple plot lines must lug around - that's what they want us to think. Good writing can always tie a fictional story together.But you can get past that - and you will, because it still is so far beyond 99% of all movies ever made, that you will permanently see life differently after watching it.",9,7,11,5 October 2013
Oblivion," A good sci fi movie
","This movie was good. In this film's aura and critical reception, I definitely noticed similarities to Minority Report (it was underrated). Without spoiling anything, it is clear that there are massive similarities to certain other sci fi movies... But maybe that is inevitable in this genre. It was very visual and sleek. The story was good, but I felt like it shouldn't have had such a family oriented wrap up of an ending. Plenty of movies that are legendary, ended with a bitter ending that better suited how humans actually are.One thing I noticed after watching this, was that blockbuster sci fi movies (this included) are becoming lame to me, because they are tending to assume that humans can't overpower the invaders, but must outsmart them with a million to one odds, and then throw a Hail Mary for the win. And/or change some high ranking enemy's heart to have them help the good guys. But it doesn't seem that far fetched that humans outsmart their opponents after a massive battle with huge losses, by adapting to their enemy and legitimately going over the top to destroy them. Is that really that weird? That is how humans beat everything else isn't it?Because this movie followed the popular paths, and also unjustifiably overlapped too much with other movies, it doesn't deserve a 10 or a 9. But if you like sci fi, you should watch this once.",8,1,1,18 October 2013
Man of Steel," As good as it gets
","After about 10-15 movie reviews on IMDb, this earns my first 10. I am not a fan of the Superhero movies that have been sprouting up over the past 5-10 years. I saw The Dark Knight, and the sequel to that. I also have seen parts of the Iron Man franchise. Those are all pretty good, but really Hollywood was just looking for a platform to serve up it's new and enhanced technology and techniques. They just needed a story - a shell. Dark Knight reigns supreme as the best of these new shells, but this was way better than The Dark Knight. For this to actually get to me, is a testament to the greatness of this movie.The size, and godlike scale of this movie, is a leap in movie power level - just like Jurassic Park or Terminator 2 was, or Avatar. If you watch this and don't consider it one of the best movies of all time, you are in denial and deluding yourself.You will be blown away, and you will be happy you saw this.",9,3,7,4 December 2013
Prisoners," Great, but Hollywood diluted it
","The only reason I didn't like this movie as a 9 or a 10, is because I felt like the story writers gave the audience what they wanted, rather than what the story wanted. It is as great as people say it is, but the standard Hollywood wrap up of a story is what you see at the end. Don't get me wrong, it was unique, and the ending was unique, you wouldn't guess it. But that really wasn't what would make the movie good. Sometimes a more dismal ending, is actually what would make the story memorable and cool, in some strange way. You will notice this if you watch this movie, you can tell that the writers actively steered the story toward a Hollywood wrap up, rather than where the story was taking the viewer, if u catch my drift.",8,0,0,21 November 2013
Elysium," Good Sci Fi Action Blade Runnin Goodness
","This movie is sick. Mr. Matt Damon has fallen into perfect circumstances to take on a Hail Mary mission with %1 chance of survival. He must become the hero that men rarely can be, to save himself and his lower- class people left to die. Bad ass fight scenes and survival action in a very well done Blade Runner like future. Halo comes to life in these fight scenes. Everything was believable and cool. The type of story was somewhat realistic in that it had believable actions of the characters. The actual sci fi setting is kind of far fetched, just because humans are still half good even though they are half evil. Also, people benefit from a balanced world, more than if it was a cruel dictatorship, for example. So for a slight story aspect that I felt could have been healed through story writing, I cannot give this a perfect score. For example, maybe there could have been more explanation given as to why the classes had become so stratified. Perhaps resource diminishment would lead to the world going into a natural and abrupt depression, causing a necessary evil of about half the population, on average, over no more than 20 years. I'm just thinking out loud.It was too good for words. You need to see this if you like Sci Fi movies or Actions movies.",9,2,3,6 November 2013
Mama," A horror movie worth watching
","I have no clue why IMDb has this at a 6.3 rating; or why IMDb has the new Evil Dead at 6.something rating. You shouldn't watch movies like these, if you don't like horror. This is a good horror movie (so was Evil Dead). Horror fans will like this.The basic aspect of the story is kind of cool, but the twists are really amazing. I actually would have enjoyed having the doctor guy's secretive involvement panned out more. We all know that it is the story of a ghost raising two children who were lost and abandoned in the woods; then they are found and rescued, and the ghost mother follows them and kills, hurts, or haunts, the people around the children. But the way that the human characters learn about the what the being is, and how they confront it in a way, and interact with it, is really good. It wasn't the best movie of all time, but it was definitely worth watching. One of the better horror films to come out in the last few years. I would give this a 9, because it really was that good, but there were a few cheap scares in this movie - you know everything is quiet and then SCREECH as something comes into the camera frame. I really dislike that when its done for that reason alone, rather than having it represent how the characters realistically would feel and interact (like when the boyfriend wakes up in the dorm room, in that movie Exorcism of Emily Rose :)",8,1,2,23 October 2013
Prometheus," As good as the first Alien
","I don't care what anybody says, this is as good as the original. Far better than all the sequels and branch outs.The most common criticism I hear, is people saying 'it didn't explain that much'. but that seems weird to me. This explained all the pillars of the story behind the Alien trilogy. Of course I can't 'spoil' things. But you should actually ask one of those critics to explain what they are talking about, because they make no sense.Ridley Scott is awesome. He helped make Alien, Gladiator, and Blade Runner. This movie is just super cool, dark, and slightly twisted; but just a killer movie. If you want a prequel to Alien, that is good and worth watching, this is it. If you hear anyone saying this isn't good, you should ask them what they expected walking into it. I can guarantee you that they won't say anything along the lines of what should be found in a Prequel to a movie. Ask them what Prequel to a movie was better and why; they probably will just stutter around and say some pointless arguments.If you like Alien, you should see this. If you never were an Alien fan in the first place, you will be one of the people who bash this movie.",9,1,3,11 November 2013
The Silence of the Lambs," Don't be tricked into thinking this is epic
","The media has a way of historical revisionism. They glorify past movies or music as if it was so legendary and sacred. As if it is beyond what we have today. But 10 or 20 years from now, they will do the same thing with what we have today.That is what happened with The Silence of the Lambs. It is good, but it isn't a perfect movie. There were some major plot holes. There were also parts that would be far better done by today's filming techniques. A plot hole is how Hannibal Lecter escapes... he was a life sentence prisoner. Anyone who has ever been to jail or prison knows, there is no escape. Because you're in a cage within a cage within a cage within a cage within a cage. and even when you are moving to a new cage, you are foot cuffed and handcuffed to a chain that is tied to like 15 other prisoners. All jails and prisons now a days also have drop off points, where giant cement gates close behind the car, as big as the wailing wall, before they let you out of the cop car. Jail is big business for the government.Also, he has some stupid way of escaping from the building that the cell was in. Totally unbelievable. The ending 'dilemma' between the protagonist and antagonist is very poorly done by today's film standards. Maybe they didn't have access to great technology and programs, but still it could have been better done. The camera view was supposed to be 1st person at one point, but it could have been more realistic to how a person would be acting in such a situation... far more.Worth watching, and good. but remember how the media tries to sell it's past to us.",8,0,0,11 November 2013
The Purge," The story of Anne Frank
","First of all, this movie is literally what happened to Anne Frank and her family. What we call a scary movie, is what German people actually did to other people. Of course, what British colonizers did to Native Americans was just as awful (and actually far more murders happened to them).So before I give you my thoughts, I definitely think you should know that real people have had this experience. So learn from what the suffering people had to go through. Good must prevail, and we must stand up to evil doers. All the people who stormed Normandy Beach made sure we could have this world.This movie was good, and I am baffled that some viewers gave it a low rating. It is exactly as advertised. The exact story is just what was advertised, and the plot really is what you would want. I would love to hear any disappointed viewer actually form a complete sentence about why this movie wasn't up to par.I can't give this a 9 or a 10, because there was a few plot holes in the story. In the purge era, people have intense security systems that bring up steel walls over the doors (and windows?). But any real person who knew about what the night was, would also probably have built shooting points in their home... like bunkers in war. Like how the Nazis in WW2 had the bunkers on Normandy Beach, where only mega automatic rifles poked through, with a small area for sight; I can shoot you, you can't shoot me... rather than what this movie did; I can't shoot you, you can't shoot me.Any real person would at least have some sort of plan for the scenario of a Purge. so that if people surround your house, you could post up on a roof top sniper spot and kill em or at least deter em. Or maybe death traps, near the entrances. Also, there was no Panic Room, in the home. Granted, the home itself was a panic room of sorts, but you would think that you would have a plan B, if murder was legal :D",8,0,0,10 November 2013
The Hangover Part III," worth watching, if u liked the others
","still one of the best comedies on the year. If you like comedies, you should see this. It actually was probably as good as hangover 2, but people are always pretty mean when they review sequels.Just don't be fooled by people's lame words about some 3rd sequel, not stacking up to the original(s). this isn't one of those cases. It is still pretty good and on par with the others. And it actually made more sense than hangover 2, in terms of believing the cooky aspects of the story line.It's good, and if you liked either of the hangovers, you should watch this. Hangover 1 was probably better, but hey, I would rather have a pretty good sequel than none at all. And it wasn't that much better, just a little bit. And, outside of comparing it to former hangovers, it still in the top 3 of all comedies of the year.",8,1,3,6 October 2013
