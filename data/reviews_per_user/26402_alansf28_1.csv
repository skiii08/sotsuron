Captain Phillips," Incredible Hanks in tension packed film!
","Hanks is the titular captain of the United States container ship MV Maersk Alabama, cruising along the coast of Somalia with a full load and heading toward the horn of Africa. Two boats of armed Somali pirates close in, ready to board the vessel.The film Captain Phillips had me on the edge of my seat through out, it had great tension all the way through and the acting was outstanding from Tom Hanks, showing exactly why he is one of my favourite actors in the final stages of the film and also a fantastic performance by all the Somalian pirates especially from Barkhad Abdi, (personally both deserving Oscars winers). Captain Phillips delivers a tight, action-packed story fraught with none of the usual missteps of the genre, and if it is indeed rewarded with the highest of honours, it will be well deserved!Defiantly worth a watch if you like real life, authentic characters, and a cast and crew that show up to deliver some of their finest works.",10,0,1,20 February 2014
