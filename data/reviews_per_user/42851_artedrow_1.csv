Sucker Punch," Greatly surpassed my expectations.
","I expected Sucker Punch to just be some non-stop action movie with girls, dragons, and guns. After seeing it, I was amazed at how far it surpassed my expectations. The visuals were great, no doubt about it, and so was the action. But the story was actually good too. Four girls trying to escape a mental institution, but there's more to it than that. The cast was great too. Emily Browning was a perfect choice and so were all the other girls. You felt a connection with them and really cared about what happened to them. Last, but surely not least, was the music. It was amazing how well it went along with the movie and it was just great music too. Overall, Sucker Punch is a great movie, that probably wont get as much praise as it should.",8,6,13,27 March 2011
