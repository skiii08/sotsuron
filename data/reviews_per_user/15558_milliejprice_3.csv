Ghost," Made me ugly cry
","Sweet late night film, Whoppi Goldberg is great. Cried a couple times then weeped at the end.",7,0,0,29 May 2020
Predator," yawn fest
","One of the most boring films I've ever seen. I know Schwarzenegger is like America's sweetheart but I've got no clue why. He acts dumb, barely strings 3 sentences together in a film. Predator is boring and so are his other films. The only interesting part was the first 20 minutes. Kudos to the originality through I guess. Waste of time.",3,1,14,15 September 2019
Joker," A must see
","I was not a massive DC fan, but this film might have just made me! Joaquin Phoenix gives an outstanding performance, his execution of Arthur Fleck chilled me to the bone. It's not often a character makes me uncomfortable, but the Joker did - it was incredible. It is not really a story so much with a beginning, middle and end, but more of an unsettling and deep character study. I speak for the whole theatre when I say it was shocking and surprising as well. (The woman next to me kept jumping out of her seat!) The character of Arthur Fleck is absolutely captivating and so so intriguing. He is fascinating to watch. The whole film has an off beat and uncomfortable tone, and Arthur's thoughts, feelings and pain is tangible and palpable. Joker delves into the characters mind like no other film.",9,4,6,12 October 2019
