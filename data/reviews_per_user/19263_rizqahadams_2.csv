Despicable Me," Not an Animation fanatic
","I, together with my English Major class watched this movie. I am not a huge fan of animation and therefore when I heard what movie we were going to watch I lost interest. As the movie progressed I enjoyed the humour and the story line. Since i have a four year old sister I am always skeptical about what types of movies she watches, but after watching Despicable Me i can definitely see why adults also have an interest in animation. The best part was watching Him grow throughout the movie, going from villain to good guy. He seems very embarrassed to show the softer side of him and with that came humour. The minions I would say were his first children, as even though there are so many of them he knows each ones names. One of the best animations I have watched thus far, certainly unforgettable!",7,1,1,26 October 2015
