Come and See," Warthe brutal...through hyper realism
","Warthe brutalthrough hyper realism! The movie begins when the thirteen-year-boy Flora enlists in the military. Since Flora is too young he couldn't be involved in the war. Finally he comes back to the village. However, the scene of village is simply horrible. From German military attacks, Flora loose his ear temporarily. After this, fear and confusion of war reflects through Flora's point of view. The movie projects the brutal war with long takes and sometimes follows the scene with steady-cam. The movie shows the horror of war in a realistic way. The movie seems to tell us, 'come and see how brutal'Mental and physical weak people should avoid seeing the movie. Otherwise, be ready to endure torture from what they see.",Null,1,1,14 December 2010
