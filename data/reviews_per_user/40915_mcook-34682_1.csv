First Man," Boring
","I grew up in the 60s watching every launch that there was. I used to get up at 3 a.m. and saw every Mercury, Gemini and Apollo mission take off. I wish I could say more about this movie, but for me it ties the record with 'The Road' as one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.
I really hoped for more.",1,10,16,20 October 2018
