Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Excellent comedy that showcases the weirdness of Americans
","For those familiar with Borat from 'The Ali G Show' this movie does not break much new ground. After all, the mannerisms of Southerners with delusions of grandeur have served as fodder for him before. But the movie blends fantasy with reality, forming a delightful little saga, peppered with American idiots.Baron Cohen is one nervy guy. It took serious balls to go through with the rodeo sequence, which took place in southwestern Virginia, particularly after the 'pep talk' and appearance advice he received from the rodeo organizer. Baron Cohen's guerrilla approach to the situations depends on his ability to stay in character and to continually step over the line, until his subjects rebel. The genius of his characters--for Ali G and Bruno perform a similar type of provocation--is that he really does nothing but present his small-minded targets with situations that elicit gut reactions from them. Politeness versus political correctness versus true feelings--this is the struggle that Borat's 'teachers' face. Some of the Americans are obviously uncomfortable with the racist or otherwise offensive comments of Borat, while others appear only too happy to have found a sympathizer with their own, barely-suppressed prejudice.For me, the most appalling of all the 'targets' were the fraternity brothers. The other audience members in the theater perhaps felt the same, because the laughter that had punctuated the showing of the movie up to that point (and that resumed afterwards) died out. Whether the drunken frat boy too much resembled some of the audience members, or if they were dismayed by the unflattering portrayal of the condoned and even celebrated drunken oaf of American culture, I do not know. I do know that the boorish, white male supremacist opinions of the frat boys, combined with their carefully cultivated, clichéd image (the rich trust fund baby who is too drunk and sloppy to comb his hair, but who opens up a fresh package of Brooks Brothers shirts every week) repelled me more than anything Borat could have done or said. The latest news is that these same frat boys, embarrassed by their own behavior, are suing 20th Century Fox, claiming that they were somehow duped into revealing their latent misogyny and bigotry. Poor, spoiled babies.This film is funny, provocative, and it will make you think about the differences between 'marketed' American culture and 'real' American culture. Highest recommendation.",10,5,19,14 November 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," An excellent children's movie--thank God they are believably English.
","I went into this movie not wanting to like it. I know the Narnia canon from front to back and, after seeing some disappointing changes made for The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, I didn't want my vision of Narnia to be tainted. But the reviews for this film were so strong that I gave in and paid my six dollars to see it. And it was excellent. For once the filmmakers (writers, really) have not taken license with the story but have instead just pared it down a little to make it fit into a timeframe. It was the CGI stuff that put me off in the previews but it didn't look too bad. I mean, occasionally it made me cringe (the fox) but on the whole it was not terribly distracting. Tilda Swinton, as the witch, steals this movie. She is not a typical Disney villain--she is a bad-ass, and while watching I remembered that, after all, she is Jadis, the warrior goddess from another world, and it seems that the writers remembered that, too. The characters in this film have older memories of Narnia: memories that go beyond the Pevensies' experience. There are enough pointed looks and loaded answers to make sure that we, the audience, are aware of their significance. The costumes and makeup in this movie are outstanding--better than Lord of the Rings, I think. The only thing I found slightly amiss was that, as per Pauline Baynes's illustrations, I had always envisioned the witch as a brunette, but she looks so totally cool otherwise that I am not complaining.",8,2,5,11 December 2005
Hot Fuzz," If you liked 'Shaun of the Dead' or 'Spaced,' you will love this
","I flat-out loved this movie. I was laughing, people around me were laughing--it was an overall great time. Terrific action sequences, which are staged to be over the top, but which end up being more realistic and gut-wrenching than your average Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay film. The 'Shaun of the Dead' team is at it again, and while this film is clearly related to that great zombie flick (mostly in that the characters seem to be progressing--even with awareness sometimes--through a giant video game), it is funny and exciting even if you are not familiar with Wright, Pegg, Frost, and the others. There is a little of everything in here--gore, humor, ass-kicking--they jettisoned the fluff, and kept the FUZZ! Highest recommendation-provided you are looking for a good time.",10,2,4,7 May 2007
Ratatouille," Delightful!
","'Ratatouille' is Pixar's best film, animation-wise, to date. It is truly remarkable for its visual landscape, and the story is charming. I went to see it with my family, and we all enjoyed it.The rats, generally viewed as disgusting creatures, are rendered adorable, but not too unrealistic (Disneyfied), on screen. And Paris is recreated with Pixar's amazing animation--the chase across the boats on the Seine is particularly stunning. Scenes with cooking and dancing rats are also enjoyable. This film is worth watching for the quality of animation alone, but the exposition about cookery, the scenery of Paris, the cute characters, and the endearing storyline should provide entertainment for almost everyone.",8,6,9,30 July 2007
Hitch," Thoroughly enjoyable
","As romantic comedies go, Hitch is as fun as it gets. Will Smith seems incapable of NOT being entertaining, no matter what he is doing. Some critics have panned this film for being predictable and/or clichéd, but why does one go to see a romantic comedy? To have one's mind blown, or to have a laugh at the awkwardness of humans in romantic situations? Hitch may not be exactly groundbreaking, but neither is it boring. Smith is a comic genius--I can't remember seeing an actor so at ease in front of the camera, so ready so mock himself, or so spontaneous in every situation. Eva Mendes is the perfect foil to Smith's overpowering personality--she holds up her end of the duo with pizazz. Chalk Hitch up with The Wedding Singer on the list of recent must-see romantic comedies.",8,0,1,16 March 2005
Blade Runner," Deep as an urban ocean
","Blade Runner is one of those movies you either get or you don't.  Some people find it bizarre and disturbing.  My father loves this movie and I watched it for the first time with him.  Blade Runner is complex and entrancing--the special effects still blow me away.  The gritty world created by Scott in this film is so believable that I wanted to become part of it.  Many fans of Dick's writing hold the movie up to the book, pointing out 'mistakes' and other changes the script makes to Deckard and to the plot, but I think this is an erroneous argument.  Scott's film shows us a realistic portrayal of what city life might become, and focuses less on the man vs. machine theme of the book.  The two should be enjoyed as separate works, for each is superior in its own way.  Scott's Blade Runner is film noir meets sci-fi, and the result is magical.  Vangelis' floating, mysterious score doesn't hurt things, either; in fact, without it, I dare to say that the impact of the movie would not be as great.",10,2,3,11 February 2002
Heat," Violent, but dreamy and mesmerizing
","Heat is definitely in my top ten favorite movies.  While it is imperfect and murky in parts, I gave it nine stars because of what it might have been, and its ambition.  I get the feeling that perhaps something went amiss in the editing process, but other than that the movie is perfect.  The soundtrack draws you in, until you are drifting in a haze above LA.  Heat reminds me in some ways of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner; while BR is darker, the two films share somewhat of the same mood.  Best seen on a large screen with surround sound (terrific action sequences, especially the bank robbery).",10,0,0,11 February 2002
The Pursuit of Happyness," Smith runs away with it
","'The Pursuit of Happiness' is a retelling of poor-boy-makes-good, or what some people like to call 'the American dream,' but it avoids the pitfalls of a clichéd storyline. Certainly, the audience can feel secure that Chris Gardner, the main character, will succeed in some fashion or else a film would never have been based on his autobiography, but the simple, sentimental score, well-written screenplay, subtle direction and, above all, Will Smith's acting make us strive with Gardner, cry with him, and hurt with him. Smith is a gifted actor, and this film really showcases his emotional range. His natural rapport with his son is in no way one-sided; Jaden Smith is believable and very charming. While I do not buy into the idea that a big house, fancy car, oodles of money made never mind how, and a high-stress Wall Street job equal happiness, to focus on the merit of Gardner's capitalist dream would be to miss the heart of the film; Gardner believes that becoming a stockbroker is his key for happiness, and we are here to appreciate his struggle as he claws his way out of the gutter. He doggedly completes his tasks each day, getting knocked down and staggering onward, sometimes taking his immense frustration out on his son, and attempting to keep up appearances so that he can go to the office. Gardner's tale is like 'Die Hard' for the masses; he has to endure being arrested, being evicted, fighting for a bed at the homeless shelter, trying to keep appointments and to study while holding down two full-time jobs with no car, sprinting all over San Francisco, attempting to keep himself and his son clean--it just does not stop. Watch Smith's face during the film--he shows us a man who only just manages to fend off despair. He bleeds and weeps because of the injustice in the world, with disappointment at how his potential has been wasted, with the weight of all his past failures, and with worry for his son. But he clings to the path he has chosen in the belief that it will lead him from this torment. One can actually see the dead look in Smith's eyes, the punch-drunk expression of one who is suffering, who is juggling so many burdens that his mind spills over with the effort, for whom a seemingly minor setback is a Big Deal. Smith gets it, and he makes us get it, too.Incidentally, were Will Smith not an actor, he could probably have been a stuntman or a professional athlete. He has had running scenes in many of his films to date, and in this movie he looks ready to set a new record for the 400 meters. Smith is a little too fit and energetic for a homeless guy who hardly sleeps and eats in a soup kitchen for much of the movie, but his running and carrying feats illustrate Gardner's bulldog tenacity, and how his own physical power and endurance aided him in achieving his ends. Smith deserves an Oscar award for his performance in this film. The movie itself is well made overall, but Smith's acting towers over everything. Well done.",10,1,3,17 December 2006
