Child 44," Must see if you're interested in the history of Soviet regime
","it's not about serial killer or manhunt. this move is one of those rare foreign pictures with attempt to reflect the horror, hopelessness, lawlessness of the soviet era in Russia. Scum and criminals like Vasiliy have been ruling this county for almost hundred year. Sadly, most people don't know their own history and thus can't learn from it..Actor's performance is brilliant. minor errors in small details are insignificant. we watched the movie tonight at Arclight and truly enjoyed it.thank you!",10,63,145,17 April 2015
