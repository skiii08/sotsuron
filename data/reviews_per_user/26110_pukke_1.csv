Marie Antoinette," A screwed up visual beauty
","I don't think it is fair to trash this movie completely.Yes it is not historical or political correct etc etc.They chose modern music for a reason, to match the modern look and pick of colors and the almost 'Moulin Rouge' atmosphere the movie has. Even the characters speak in a modern fashion and use words like ridiculous, great and such.None of the characters even have accents and even though Marie's daughter speak french, Marie doesn't (which was one of the few things I disliked about the movie)It is not a historical masterpiece to me but a comical, fashionable, fun and beautiful movie.And just for the splendid visuals I would give it a star. But since I also liked the way it was filmed and the music and overall fun little puns the movie got, I give it 6 stars.",Null,0,1,11 November 2011
