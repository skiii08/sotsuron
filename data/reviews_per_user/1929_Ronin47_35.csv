Kill Bill: Vol. 2," QT has done it again. (****)
","When I saw 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' last October, it was one of the most amazing experiences I'd ever had in a movie theater. Combining pretty much everything I've ever loved about movies since I was a little kid into one fantastic (half of a) film, it was like a blast of pure oxygen, a jolt of adrenaline that stayed with me for weeks. 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is not the same kind of film. The people who are saying that the two movies are very different in tone and style are correct. This is by no means a bad thing, though, because their differences make for a fascinating comparison. 'Vol. 1' is paced to kill, a movie that seldom pauses for character development or even dialogue, yet STILL possesses extraordinary emotional depth, mostly because of Uma Thurman's stunning, Oscar-worthy performance. The Bride (whose name is revealed in 'Vol. 2') is one of the most fiercely sympathetic characters in movie history. 'Vol. 2' is much more introspective and relaxed, more about emotions than violence (although there is plenty of it). I have a feeling that many will be bored with it, as they were with 'Jackie Brown'. But like 'Jackie Brown', I think this film will also reveal layers upon layers of riches upon each viewing, and will age beautifully. In 'Vol. 1', The Bride crossed O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) off of her death list, and now in 'Vol. 2' she has three people left to kill who played a hand in the Massacre at Two Pines: Budd (Michael Madsen), the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and of course Bill (a great David Carradine), none of whom are going to make it easy for her.
During a terrifying scene where the Bride is buried alive, the film switches to a flashback of her days as a student of the ruthless kung-fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). This sequence is actually my favorite part of the whole movie, and Pai Mei is hands down one of the most entertaining characters I've seen in a long time. When the flashback ends and we find out why the Bride was remembering his teachings at that particular moment, it has a remarkable emotional payoff (set to the gloriously triumphant 'L'Arena' from one of Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western scores). In the end, I think I slightly prefer the no-holds-barred mayhem of 'Vol. 1' to the more laid-back 'Vol. 2', but is it still a totally awesome and entertaining movie? Does the story come to a satisfactory conclusion? And is Uma Thurman's performance just as extraordinary as it was in the first film? Yes, yes and yes. Hell yes.",10,0,1,8 June 2004
Miracle," Nice, but nothing special (**1/2)
","Way too long, hurt by some very corny dialogue and a little too much flag-waving, this story of the U.S. hockey team's victory against the formidable Russian team at the 1980 Olympics is still pretty well done.
It's pretty slow going most of the time, but is worth checking out for the excellent final game sequence, which has been shot in an intense way that places you directly in the middle of the action, making it suspenseful even though the outcome is obvious. Kurt Russell is very good as the coach, though his character flirts with being unsympathetic at times. The team is played by a large group of unknown actors who all do good work, but only Eddie Cahill stands out as Jim Craig, a troubled player. Not a great movie, but it was alright.",6,0,3,6 March 2004
50 First Dates," Ok, but not a Sandler classic (**1/2)
","Once again, here's an Adam Sandler movie with a nifty idea, a likeable cast and all the potential in the world to be a good, fun comedy. But it doesn't quite get there. I really like Adam Sandler, both as a person and a comedian. The problem is, only three of his movies are any good: 'Happy Gilmore', 'The Wedding Singer', and of course 'Punch-Drunk Love'. The first two were just good comedies, plain and simple, while the third was a spellbinding, artsy, dark romantic comedy that utterly confused his core fans (maybe they were wondering why Rob Schneider never turned up in a stupid costume).
'50 First Dates' is by no means as terrible as Sandler's worst films, like 'Anger Management', 'The Waterboy', the hideous 'Mr. Deeds', or 'Along Came Polly' (oops, that was a bad Adam Sandler movie that happened to star Ben Stiller instead). But it's not nearly as good as it should be.
Sandler plays Henry, a ladies' man living in Hawaii who meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) in a local restaurant and they like each other. So he's surprised the next day when she doesn't even know who he is. The deal is that over a year earlier, she was in a bad car accident and has lost most of her short-term memory due to a head injury. She remembers everything up to the accident, but can't remember anything afterwards for more than a day. In an effort to keep her happy, her family and friends try hard to keep her re-living the same day over and over. There are a lot of good qualities in '50 First Dates'. The ways in which Lucy's family and friends try to keep her happy is really very touching, especially on her 'bad days', which they are also prepared for. And as they proved in 'The Wedding Singer', Sandler and Barrymore have good, goofy chemistry. They have a few genuinely sweet and romantic scenes together.
Unfortunately, the negatives almost equal the positives. There are tons of jokes and lines that fall dead flat (you could have heard a pin drop in the theater during some of the 'funny' parts), several annoying secondary characters, and the uneasy feeling you get when a movie is trying to be really cutesy AND cram in unnecessary toilet humor at the same time.
Still, it's not a bad time. Even the worst Sandler movies have great soundtracks (this one features Bob Marley, the Beach Boys, and some Cure covers), and there is surprisingly bittersweet ending, given a huge emotional boost by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's gentle 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World' (which was also used for the closing credits of 'Finding Forrester'). It's not all that good overall, but still, I have generally warm feelings about seeing it, which means the good stuff is staying in my mind longer than the bad, so I guess that counts for something.",6,0,0,6 March 2004
Monster," Not entirely flawless, but devastating nonetheless (***1/2)
","You may have read a lot about Charlize Theron's astounding performance in 'Monster' and her amazing transformation from being gorgeous and elegant to being haggard and rough-edged. Those reports have not been exaggerated. If she doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for her role here (and say, Nicole Kidman does for 'Cold Mountain'), I might not even watch the ceremony.She plays Aileen Wuornos, the highway prostitute who murdered six clients back in 1988 and was executed last year. Not giving a whole lot in the way of background, the film concentrates only on a short amount of time in Wuornos' life, shortly before the murders, during, and shortly after.
Though she was not herself a lesbian, she began a relationship just before the murders with a naive, co-dependent lesbian named Selby (Christina Ricci), simply because she was so achingly lonely that she was willing to be with anyone who liked her.Her first murder was in self-defense, and if it was anything like it's shown here (a extremely brutal beating and rape), it was well justified.
After that, she tries for a short while to go straight and get a real job, but fails miserably and goes back to hooking, killing some clients for money.Writer/director Patty Jenkins doesn't shy away from showing all of Wuornos' killings for what they were after that first one: brutal and unnecessary (not self-defense, as the real Wuornos claimed ALL her killing were). But she also takes great strides to humanize the character, giving her genuine feelings and a desperate romance (including a truly romantic roller skating scene set to Journey's 'Don't Stop Believin'') that arouses feeling of sympathy in us, which is surprising and gives her character (who really is a monster, there's no doubt about that) truly tragic shadings. We despise her for her actions, but feel sad for her about the hand she's been dealt in life.'Monster' may not be the feel-good hit of the year, but it's a harsh and powerful film that elicits strong emotional reactions and has one of the best performances to hit screens in years. In other words, highly recommended.",9,0,0,8 January 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Very good remake of my all-time favorite film (***1/2)
","There's no other way to start this review than to state that George A. Romero's original, 1978 masterpiece 'Dawn Of The Dead', about 4 survivors of a zombie plague setting up house in an empty shopping mall, is my favorite movie of all time. I remember the first time I saw it like it was yesterday.
A lot of the other fans of the original were upset at the idea of this remake, but I was excited. I'm not a purist, so as long as the makers paid respect to the original and made a good-enough movie that wasn't TOO stupid, I'd be happy. Well, I couldn't be happier to tell you that unlike the lame botch-job that was the 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake, this 'Dawn...' remake met my expectations...and then some. Technically, it's not being called a 'remake' but rather a 're-envisioning', because the characters and sequence of events are quite different. I didn't mind this, because it's far more interesting to see a reworking of a theme than an exact remake, and there is lots of interesting ground left to cover in Romero's brilliantly imagined post-apocalyptic society.
After the unexplained plague hits and proceeds to turn all of society upside down within a matter of hours, a few survivors, which include a nurse (great indie actress Sarah Polley), a cop (Ving Rhames), and a young man (Mekhi Phifer) with his very pregnant Russian girlfriend (Inna Korobkina), head to the local mall looking for shelter. Once they lock the entrances and it's clear that no help is coming, they proceed for a while to build a new life in the shopping mall. It's a fascinating concept, building an insulated, miniature utopian society inside this giant mall, while just outside, the whole world is crumbling.
The problem, though, is that there are far too many characters in this one. In the original, there were only four, and as a result they were each extremely well developed. Here, there's at least 15 people in the mall, and many of them seem to be just filling space. Though it's true that Romero's smart social commentary takes a backseat here to hard-driving action scenes, this is still a very tough and intelligent film. A few other critics and I picked up on an eerie, distinctly post-9/11 vibe, the idea of living in a burned-out, post-apocalyptic America (an American flag makes an ironic appearance near the end). Hmm, maybe the zombies are George W. Bush's followers? Ultimately, writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder have gone out of their way to make a really fine film here, and it shows. They don't stray far from Romero's vision or dumb-down the material, they retained much of his dark humor, they assembled a quality cast, and included several clever cameos and in-jokes for those of us familiar with the original.
So it's not Romero, but it's still a hell of a good time.And be sure not to arrive late. The first 10 minutes of this film (which includes what is bar none the best opening credits sequence I've seen in years), make for a powerful experience all their own.",9,0,0,28 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Johnny Depp is great, movie is weak (**)
","An 'adaptation' of a ride at Disneyland seemed like kind of a flimsy idea, so I'm not entirely surprised that this overblown entry in the 2003 summer movie season isn't all that good. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a humorously goofy pirate who walks with a constant, drunken swagger. Depp, as always, gives a fun and eccentric performance and gets some great lines in, but unfortunately he's the only thing worth remembering about this movie. The story and all the other characters are a total snooze. Jack is trying to get his ship, the Black Pearl, back from a group of skeletal ghost pirates (led by a hammy Geoffrey Rush) who have kidnapped the beautiful Elizabeth Swann (Winona Ryder look-alike Keira Knightley) in order to use her blood to bring them back to life. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is in love with Elizabeth, so he teams up with Sparrow. Bloom, from the 'Lord Of The Rings' movies and Knightley, from this year's great 'Bend It Like Beckham' are both interesting actors, but the characters they're playing might as well be cardboard cutouts. There is lots of action and some twists in the story, but I found very little of it interesting. In fact, Johnny Depp's likable performance and one-liners were all that kept me awake through the ridiculous 2 hour, 15 minute running time. It's directed by Gore Verbinski, and I guess it shows he can direct a big summer movie, but it completely lacks the small-scale style and effectiveness of his earlier films like last year's eerie 'The Ring' and especially the quirky, sadly underrated 'The Mexican'.
And when the army of skeletons shows up in the end, all I could think about was how much cooler it was in 'Army Of Darkness'. I liked Depp's performance, but in a nutshell, the ride is better.",4,1,2,19 October 2003
Bloody Sunday," Somewhat slow but gut-wrenching (***)
","The events in Derry, Northern Ireland on January 30th, 1972 are gut-wrenchingly re-created in Paul Greengrass' 'Bloody Sunday'.On that day, several hundred Irish people led a civil rights march that, somewhere along the way, became violent, and 13 Irish citizens lay dead by the guns of British soldiers (14 more were wounded, one of whom died later). To this day, what exactly happened remains cloudy. The British soldiers maintained that they were only returning fire initiated by armed marchers, but many facts seem to contradict this. 'Bloody Sunday' takes the Irish point of view, in which the British had no reason to fire upon the marchers, but did so anyway.The best thing about the movie is its style, which is that of a documentary. There are abrupt fade-outs at the end of every scene, there is no music, and the jerky, hand-held camera seems to be held by someone who is actually there witnessing these events. Many times, the camera follows behind characters as they walk, panning up and down, back and forth, as a person might actually glance around. This creates one of the most convincing 'you-are-there' feelings I've ever had while watching a movie. It's effective the whole time, but especially during the 20 or so minutes when the massacre is happening. These scenes are depicted with a rawness and realism that is absolutely horrifying, like being trapped in a nightmare you can't wake up from.The downside is that, even as intense and immediate as the film is, the first half (leading up to the massacre) drags in places. Also, the abstract 'documentary' form makes it near impossible to include character development, and as a result most of the characters never really grab us emotionally, except on a life-or-death gut level. The only character who truly emerges from the crowd is Ivan Cooper, a real-life Irish civil rights leader who is trying to lead the march in the non-violent style of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but becomes aware early-on that things might get out of hand, and they do, with tragic results. He is played by James Nesbitt in a performance filled with many intriguing layers, which is hard to do, considering the cold, observational style of the filming.One other thing, and of course it's not the filmmakers' fault, but the thick Irish and British accents made it hard for me to understand what the characters were saying much of the time. That said, though, it's never hard to understand what's happening.",Null,4,11,25 November 2002
The Girl Next Door," Should be a lot better, but it's alright (***)
","This is one of those times that the 3-star rating is mainly a sentimental one. There are many moments in 'The Girl Next Door', mainly in its first half, that capture that awesome 80's-ness of the best teen comedies of the 80's, but at the same time it's not nearly as good as it should (and easily could) be. Obviously heavily inspired by the 1983 Tom Cruise teen classic 'Risky Business' (even the score mimics the 'Risky Business' score at key moments), it's about an ambitious but indifferent high school senior named Matthew (Emile Hirsch, 'The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys') whose comfortable world is thrown into disarray when the stunningly beautiful Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert, from TV's '24') moves in next door. They strike up a relationship the kind of way that you only see in the movies, but it's very entertaining (and like 'Risky Business', it's more about teenage wish-fulfillment than reality), so I didn't mind. Then things get complicated when Matt learns, through his porn-addicted friend Eli (the hilarious Chris Marquette), that Danielle is a porn star.
In the first half, 'The Girl Next Door' is a lot of fun. It's well-paced, interesting, funny, and the soundtrack keeps throwing great songs at you. Unfortunately, the second half is dragged down quite a bit by the unnecessary addition of several non-entertaining subplots and characters that distract from what the movie should be about: Matthew's sexual awakening. Still, even though I almost stuck it with a **1/2, there are just enough good scenes and great songs to get a somewhat-shaky but solid recommendation from me. After all, any movie that makes good use of 'Under Pressure' by Queen and David Bowie AND The Who's 'Baba O'Riley' (two of my all-time favorite songs) will probably get my vote.",7,5,11,8 June 2004
Coffee and Cigarettes," A blast (***1/2)
","Talk about an appropriate title. This is a collection of 11 short stories directed by indie stalwart Jim Jarmusch ('Strangers in Paradise', 'Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai') that have been filmed over the last 18 years, all of which involve two or more characters simply sitting at a table, conversing over...yep, coffee and cigarettes. In the hands of a lesser director that might be extremely boring, but Jarmusch is a master of subtle understatement and great deadpan humor. This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. Almost all the actors play themselves, which adds a meta-theatrical, slightly surreal touch to it all. Among my favorite stories are one in which an overly eager Alfred Molina has a surprise in store for coolly arrogant fellow actor Steve Coogan and a great one in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke (to celebrate quitting smoking), Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil, and in the funniest casting, RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan sharing some downtime with, of all people, Bill Murray. I also like the one with Spike Lee's twin siblings, Joie and Cinque, dealing with an invasive waiter (a hilarious Steve Buscemi). Almost all the stories are excellent, but there are three that are very forgettable and pretty unnecessary, and they're all in a row, which disrupts the flow of the film. If those three had been taken out, 'Coffee and Cigarettes' would be just about perfect, but it's still really good. And those three are out of the way in the first half, anyway.
For the first hour the movie feels mainly just like fun. Straight-faced, deadpan, B&W comedy just like 'Strangers In Paradise'. But as it goes on, and strange connections are made between the stories, it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. The final story in particular, in which two old men in a dark room (Bill Rice and Taylor Mead) discuss life while on a coffee break that feels like it'll last forever, has a distinct 'Waiting For Godot' feel and ends the movie on a perfect note of haunting, existential sadness.
It was at that point that I realized I hadn't just watched a string of jokey short stories, but a string of jokey short stories that say a lot about human nature and life in general. And if that's not enough to interest you, how often do you get to see Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have a conversation? Or RZA, GZA, and Bill Murray?",9,92,107,4 July 2004
Troy," Ehh. (**1/2)
","Ehh, the (**1/2) is more a rating for a few select scenes that are pretty awesome rather than the whole, because as a whole, this movie didn't engage me very much. As Achilles, Brad Pitt isn't bad, but he looks like a surfer and sounds like one when he speaks. Eric Bana is pretty good as Hector, the most sympathetic character in the film. So two good fight scenes (especially the one between Pitt and Bana), a few good battle sequences, and a very good scene between Pitt and Peter O'Toole. That's the awesome stuff, everything else ranges from alright to dull (and the dialogue sounds like a medieval soap opera most of the time).
It looks really nice, but in the end it's more exhausting than entertaining.",5,1,2,8 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Dumb and cheesy, but it's entertaining and has great FX - hay, just like 'Independence Day'! (***)
","A couple weeks ago I wrote that 'Van Helsing' was one of the dumbest movies I'd ever seen, and not in a good way. Now here's 'The Day After Tomorrow', which is also monumentally dumb, but in a very good way. Though both are pretty stupid in concept, 'The Day After Tomorrow' is ambitious and entertaining, while 'Van Helsing' was dreary, dull and unimaginative.
Harkening back to the sci-fi disaster flicks of decades past with the word 'Day' in the title ('The Day The Earth Stood Still', 'The Day The Earth Caught Fire', 'The Day After'), 'The Day After Tomorrow' is a movie about mass-scale destruction with a point to make. It's about the devastation that could be caused to the Earth in the future because of global warming. But mostly, like director Roland Emmerich's 'Independence Day', it's about letting those special effects fly and showing us some crazy stuff.
Global warming causes the melting of the ice caps which triggers a huge and devastating climate change on Earth, causing, among other things, cantaloupe-sized hail in Tokyo, tornadoes that tear L.A. apart, and in the film's scariest sequence, a gigantic tidal wave that covers most of New York City. The L.A. and New York scenes feature some truly amazing special effects. Also like 'Independence Day', it features a large cast, with the characters grouped in different places, enduring different hardships. The only group of characters I found interesting were a teenager named Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal, looking a bit lost in his first big-budget, mainstream film but doing a good job), some of his friends, and some other people trapped in the upper floors of the New York public library. Along with tremendous special effects, 'The Day After Tomorrow' features great cinematography and a well-done sense of dread in its first half. To see thousands of birds flying south all at once because of something they know and the characters don't is an eerie sight. But oh boy, is it dumb. The dialogue is terrible, and there are many scenes where characters say something and then glare at each other while intense music plays and you half expect the actors to crack up. This is also a movie in which it's possible to outrun cold air (which actually makes for an exciting scene), and where even after New York City has been flooded by a tidal wave, there is still someone behind the information desk in the library to helpfully point out where the nearest phone is.
However, the dumbness of 'The Day After Tomorrow' didn't detract from my enjoyment of it, and in some cases even added to it. Besides, you don't go to a movie like this for character development or dialogue. You go to see some awesome sights, get a few thrills, and you're lucky if just 2 or 3 of the characters are halfway interesting, and on those counts it delivers.
This is a big, bold, cheesy theme-park ride of a movie, and if that's all you expect, you won't be disappointed.",7,0,0,8 June 2004
Alien," Not quite perfect, but very close (***1/2)
","Ridley Scott's 1979 classic is back on the big screen with a few minor changes, just in time for Halloween. Though it obviously has sci-fi qualities, 'Alien' is first and foremost a horror film, and it's a grim and relentless one. The giant ship Nostromo that it takes place on plays the role of a haunted house and the Alien is like the killer in a slasher film, picking off members of the cast one by one. However, its simplicity is exactly what gives it the raw charge it's always had. Like John Carpenter's great, underrated remake of 'The Thing' that came out 3 years later, it gives us a cast of likable, middle-aged working stiffs, puts them in contact with a hostile alien presence, and coldly observes as they scramble for their lives, resulting in nearly unbearable and uniquely realistic suspense. This was the first time I'd ever seen 'Alien' on the big screen (I was 1 year-old when it came out), and I really enjoyed it. Some of the special effects look a little cheesy now, but most of them still look great.
As for the monsters, the egg-laying spider creature is still one of the ickiest in movie history, and the H.R. Giger designed mother Alien is a vicious, slimy beast that is not quite like any other.
The cast is great too, especially Sigourney Weaver as Ripley (of course), Tom Skeritt as the ship's studly captain (he'll survive a long time, right?), and Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dead Stanton, who are immensely enjoyable as two constantly grumbling mechanics. 'Alien' is a great movie, but there a few slow patches and I've always felt that it takes a little too long to really start kicking ass. Those are very minor flaws, though, and are all that's keeping it from my 4-star rating.
As good as 'Alien' is, it would get dwarfed (in my opinion and many other peoples') by its 1986 sequel, James Cameron's astoundingly intense 'Aliens', a brilliant action/sci-fi/horror film that is so good it's renowned as a masterpiece in all three of those genres. Compared to that movie, 'Alien' looks downright humble. But it gets to job done, and done good.",9,0,1,1 November 2003
Elf," A Christmas movie that doesn't suck! (***1/2)
","Good Christmas movies are a rare find, great Christmas movies even more rare. At this point, I wouldn't yet count 'Elf' among my very favorite Christmas movies, like 'A Christmas Story', 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' or 'Ernest Saves Christmas' (that's right, I said 'Ernest Saves Christmas'), but I really loved it, and I think that it may join those other movies once it ages a bit. It really is that good.Will Ferrell is definitely an acquired taste, but it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't be amused and delighted by his very enjoyable performance as Buddy, a human who was raised by elves in the North Pole after he crawled into Santa's toy bag as a baby.Thirty-or-so years later, when Buddy has outgrown his elf surroundings, Papa Elf (a droll Bob Newhart) suggests he go to New York City to find his real father (James Caan).Naturally, there are no big curveballs thrown at the audience. There are lots of fish-out-of-water jokes, an innocent romance with a co-worker (Zooey Deschanel, who is great and looks much better with blonde hair than I expected), and a heartwarming ending, as expected. But this isn't the kind of movie that needs to be extra-original, and it more than makes up for its lack of originality with huge amounts of heart and charm.Having a pro actor/filmmaker like Jon Favreau directing (and not just some hack) is also definitely a plus. He gives a formulaic Christmas movie style and feeling, filling the soundtrack with lots of big band jazz and assembling a great supporting cast that also includes Mary Steenburgen, Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Andy Richter and KG! (Tenacious D fans will know who I'm talking about)All in all, this is a very fun, very pure movie that I heartily recommend to anyone who, like me, thinks that most Christmas movies suck. This is the real deal, and I know that because it made me feel like a kid again.",8,1,2,20 November 2003
Lost in Translation," Simple, funny and moving (***1/2)
","Isn't it strange how it's often easier to open up and talk about your life, the meaning of everything and your own deepest problems with a complete stranger, as opposed to someone you've known your whole life?
This little irony is at the heart of 'Lost Of Translation', a strange and funny comedy/drama set in the surreal neon jungle of Tokyo, Japan.
Bill Murray plays Bob Harris, an American movie star who is in Tokyo to earn an easy couple million by doing a commercial, as many American celebrities do. Bored, lonely, and feeling like a sell-out, he meets 19 year-old Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson from 'Ghost World') who is staying in the same hotel and is also bored and lonely, even though she is there with her husband, a neglectful, high-strung photographer (Giovanni Ribisi).
If this were a Hollywood movie, this would be the set-up for a cheesy May-December romance plot, but 'Lost In Translation' is much deeper than that. This is a movie about friendship between two people, decades apart in age but both unhappy in the same way, who are able to make the other happy for a brief time. It's about both the nervousness and freedom you feel when you're a long way from home in a strange place, interacting with a completely different culture. It's about looking out your hotel window, down to a city that is busily alive while your own life stands still. And it's funny, too. Bill Murray gives a performance that is funny, touching, and brilliantly deadpan - it's one of his best ever. And Scarlett Johansson does an amazing job forming such a convincing, poignant friendship with a man 34 years her senior. You really feel as if these two understand each other completely.
All vacations must end though, and both Bill and Charlotte have to get back to their regular lives, possibly never seeing each other again, which allows for one of the most realistic, moving final scenes I've seen in a while.
With all that, and a great soundtrack that features Elvis Costello, My Bloody Valentine, and the Jesus & Mary Chain, this is one of the best movies I've seen all year. This is only writer/director Sofia Coppola's second film (after 1999's creepy, enigmatic 'The Virgin Suicides') and definitely moves her up from 'very promising' to 'a sure thing'. I'll definitely be looking forward to her third.",9,0,0,19 October 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Lame (**)
","And....out goes the 'Matrix' trilogy. With a thud.'The Matrix', the original, was a brilliant movie. It was unique, creative, mindbending, exciting, and above all, FUN.'The Matrix Reloaded' was significantly less fun (too many dull, pretentious speeches) but it was a good movie, and the freeway chase is a phenomenal action sequence that will deservedly be remembered for a long time.And now we have 'The Matrix Revolutions', which takes everything that was bad about '...Reloaded' and magnifies it. The storyline (machines vs. mankind, etc...) that was interesting in the original because we only saw the edge of it all, has been stretched out to a ridiculous limit like string cheese, and rendered sloppy and meaningless. The further you go with this plot, the sillier it gets.Nothing has changed from the last film. There's Neo, there's Morpheus, there's Trinity, there's a bunch of dirty extras, there's the slow motion, there's a bunch of Agent Smiths, there's that same music. What's missing is any sense of interest in the story. The makers obviously just like to toy with our heads, which is evident in dialogue like ('Who is he?'/'He is you.' or 'What do you want?'/'I want what you want'). That's about as 'deep' as it gets.Naturally, I have to point out that the special effects are great. It's a great film to LOOK at, some of the time. But that won't carry a movie. With the exception of a few scenes, it's a repetitive, pointless movie that does nothing to advance OR conclude the storyline that was so good the first time around.And I haven't even mentioned the Zion Council who dress like Funkadelic, or the part where the good guy-controlled giant machines 'pump their fists' (which got a good laugh from the audience, as many parts did), or when Neo goes to visit the Wizard of Oz. You heard me. That's what it looked like.",4,0,0,5 November 2003
Cold Mountain," Well, the last hour is good (**1/2)
","Miramax's 'gimme some Oscars!' movie for this year, 'Cold Mountain' is a distant and rather empty movie, but does manage to become pretty involving in its last hour. You just have to get through an extremely bumpy hour and a half to get to it, which isn't really worth it if you ask me.
Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the several European actors trying on southern accents here (well, Nicole Kidman is Australian, but you know what I mean), as two southern lovebirds during the Civil War who barely let each other know of their feelings before Law's character, Inman, leaves for war. Kidman's Ada is then left home to fend for herself, after her preacher father (Donald Sutherland) dies and leaves her broke and hungry.
Near the start of the film is a huge battle sequence that in my opinion is not very well filmed, with its fake-looking, orange CG sky and comically overbearing choir music. Hospitalized soon after, Inman decides to desert and head home to Ada. And that's basically the meat of the story, we cut back and forth between Inman's journey on foot home (crossing paths with several would-be interesting people, but the only actually interesting one is played by Natalie Portman) and Ada's struggle to survive at home, with the help of a sassy local woman, Ruby (Renee Zellweger). After solidly disliking 'Cold Mountain' for a long time, I was surprised to actually become quite involved in the last hour, when the plight that Ada and Ruby are facing becomes genuinely interesting and suspenseful, especially when dealing with the intriguing neighbor played by Kathy Baker. Kidman's character finally becomes interesting and so does Zellweger's, who seemed overbearing at first, but suddenly becomes likeable and sympathetic.
In a nutshell, 'Cold Mountain' is pretty to look at and has good performances, but it's cold and remote for the most part, and only comes alive in a few isolated scenes. Pretty much like the other two Anthony Minghella films I've seen ('The English Patient' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'). One note of interest is that it does feature the first and not-bad-at-all acting performance by Jack White of the phenomenal rock band the White Stripes, playing one of the members of Ada's father's bluegrass band. That's pretty cool, I guess.",5,0,1,8 January 2004
Van Helsing," Worse than I imagined (1/2*)
","'Van Helsing' could very well be the funniest movie of 2004. The only problem is that the parts that are SUPPOSED to be funny aren't funny at all, and all the parts that AREN'T supposed to be funny are hysterical. This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and not in a good way.Hugh Jackman plays the famous titular character (who I don't believe was ever envisioned as a swarthy superhero, but oh well), who is sort of like the James Bond of whatever century this is set in (I didn't care enough to notice). He has gadgets, works for the Catholic church, and goes around killing monsters. While the original character of Van Helsing was only after Dracula, this Van Helsing also fights Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, and in the first horribly bad scene in the movie, Mr. Hyde (who is shown here as a sort of ultra fake-looking giant pudgy caveman). There are simply too many idiotic parts in this movie that I couldn't possibly recite them all. There's Kate Beckinsale's ludicrous 'gypsy' accent ('Ze Frankenstein monsta!'), Richard Roxburgh (who was great in 'Moulin Rouge') playing one of the worst Draculas in movie history, the terrible 'brides of Dracula' (one of them taunts Van Helsing with the devastating grade school put-down 'Too bad. So sad!'), the dopey comic relief, the complete over-use of (badly done) CGI... I could go on and on. And I haven't even mentioned Jackman bounding around in a loincloth, or the 'funny sidekick' played by David Wenham who I was dearly hoping would get killed.On the plus side, there are some pretty nice sights here and there, of mountains and castles and such. All completely fake of course.Some movies can be dumb in a smart way (like the 'Charlie's Angels' movies), or at least dumb in an entertaining way. 'Van Helsing', though it certainly has enough unintentional laugh-out-loud moments to make it slightly bearable, is so dumb and so long (almost 2 1/2 hours!) that it ends up draining the energy from you instead of giving you a surreal good time, like the best 'bad' movies can do. Combining all the classic monsters into one film is a nice idea, but it was already done in 1987, in 'The Monster Squad', one of my favorite horror movies as a kid. That movie was much scarier than this piece of crap, and was INTENTIONALLY funny. So rent that instead.",1,4,9,8 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Wow, and I didn't even LIKE the first two (***1/2)
","I was thoroughly lukewarm on the first two Harry Potter films, and though I was a little intrigued because this new installment was directed by Alfonso Cuaron ('Y Tu Mama Tambien'), I still wouldn't say I was looking FORWARD to it. Boy, am I glad I went. 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the most thrilling big-screen experiences I've had in quite a while. Harry (a quickly maturing Daniel Radcliffe, and all the better actor for it) is now in his third year at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and has just received word that a dangerous murderer named Sirius Black (an enjoyably berserk Gary Oldman) has escaped from prison. Black was a friend of Harry's parents who betrayed them, leading to their deaths, and now he's after Harry. That may sound like a pretty spare story, but it's all the movie needs. From beginning to end, it's one amazing, creative set-piece after another.
Maybe I just didn't notice before because I didn't really care for the films, but was Hogwarts School always this beautiful? The grounds of this school are absolutely breathtaking. I'd go to school there in a second.
Even though I was intrigued by Cuaron directing the film, I hadn't really expected his style (as opposed to the apple pie non-style of the previous director, Chris Columbus) to have an impact on such a mainstream, multi-million dollar commodity as a Harry Potter film, but I was thankfully wrong. In addition to the more whimsical and amazing visuals, Cuaron actually brings a lean and mean edge to the film. That's right, I said the new Harry Potter film actually has 'edge'. Not a whole lot, but certainly more than the previous films. The story moves quickly (even when it takes its time), it's genuinely exciting and sometimes scary, and what happens to the characters actually seems to MATTER. There's also a rather brilliantly done time-travel twist near the end, which is actually what's responsible for me raising the star rating by half a star. After this rip-roaring, exhilarant film, I'm actively looking forward to the next Harry Potter film, which has never happened before. At least I am if Cuaron's directing it.",8,0,0,4 July 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Not bad, but not that good either (**1/2)
","I'm no huge fan of Ashton Kutcher, but I feel sorry for the guy lately, what with the beating he constantly gets from the press. Far too many of the reviews that I've read for 'The Butterfly Effect' make mention of his oh! so! shocking! relationship with Demi Moore, which is not only beside the point, it's petty. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that Ashton Kutcher is not one of my favorite actors, but I think there are far worse out there (with greater 'faults' than dating a beautiful older woman), and I give him credit for trying something darker and different in 'The Butterfly Effect', even if the movie has a lot of problems. Kutcher plays Evan Treborn, a college student who is haunted by a troubled adolescence. Many traumatic things happened to him and his friends in childhood, but he always blacked out and didn't remember anything. Now he's found that by reading his old journals he can travel back in time to the moment of those traumatic blackouts and change things, altering history. How? Don't ask me. But the reason I more-or-less liked 'The Butterfly Effect' is because I didn't look for logical answers to questions like that. I simply looked at it as what it was intended to be, which is a 'Twilight Zone'-style meditation on how one small event can sometimes alter an entire life, and how sometimes when you save one person, you're only damning another. Evan keeps going further and further back in time to fix things, only to discover that by playing God, all he's doing is digging a deeper hole for himself and his friends. It's like a cross between a Stephen King novel (because of the childhood friends who share a dark secret...or two, or three) an episode of 'The Twilight Zone', and 'Groundhog's Day'. I basically enjoyed the movie, but in the end there are just a few too many parts that are lame or annoying, as well as some bad dialogue, mediocre acting (Amy Smart and Elden Hensen are very good, but Kutcher is hit-and-miss), and a really dull, dreary middle section.
I believe all of us can think of a moment in our lives when, had the events been even slightly different, our entire lives would be changed. 'The Butterfly Effect' doesn't really delve into that fascinating concept too deeply, but it's a moderately entertaining and occasionally even touching film. Nothing to write home about, but not that bad either.",6,2,6,31 January 2004
Seabiscuit," Boring, self-righteous Oscar bait (**)
","It's impossible to argue with the many people who will like this ultra-earnest, ultra-square true story about an undersized horse named 'Seabiscuit' who ended up proving all the naysayers wrong and won Horse Of The Year back in 1938. It's a terrific, inspiring real-life story, it's well shot and has a great cast. The problem is, I just didn't get into it. Instead of being interested or inspired, I wound up just sleepy, especially with listening to David McCullough's bedtime-story narration.
You definitely can't argue with the cast. Tobey Maguire, Chris Cooper, and Jeff Bridges all do nice work, but they don't do anything they haven't done in many movies before. Maguire as a smart kid with lots of inner turmoil, Cooper as the wise and benevolent guy to look up to, and Bridges as the over-confident but nice guy. They've all done this stuff before, and it all just feels kind of old, even if this particular story hasn't been told before. You can just hear everyone involved thinking 'Oh yeah, this is gonna get some Oscars'. It's also hopelessly corny. Even though I almost always prefer at least a little grittiness in my movies, I do like apple-pie movies from time to time ('October Sky' being an excellent example), but 'Seabiscuit' just pushed the corniness too far for me. Maybe I'm cynical, but I was rolling my eyes half the time. And whoever should have been there to tell the usually-great William H. Macy to rein in his annoying, gimmicky performance, wasn't.",4,0,4,19 October 2003
City of God," Jolting, epic and powerful (***1/2)
","The City Of God is a housing project in Brazil just outside of lush Rio de Janeiro that, to put it plainly, makes South Central L.A. look like a walk in the park.  Drugs and guns are a fact of life, dead bodies lie in the streets and kids barely into their double-digits carry machine guns.The film spans several years in the life of Rocket (played as an adult by Alexandre Rodrigues), a decent kid who first watched his older brothers' gang, the 'Tender Trio', meet with unfortunate ends.  Now, as a young adult, he tries to stay out of trouble but is unsure how long he can do that and still get by.This is a jolting, visceral movie ('raw' doesn't even seem to do it justice).  The camera-work is mostly shaky and hand-held, and it looks so much like a documentary at times that it's hard to remember that what we're seeing isn't real.  One scene in particular, in which a kid who couldn't be older than 12 is initiated into a gang by being forced to shoot a terrified, crying, even younger child is one of the most horrifying scenes I've ever seen.Yet one of the most amazing things about 'City Of God' is that despite nightmarish scenes like that one, it's actually an enjoyable film. 
To be sure, it is still a brutally realistic descent into hell, but it's one with several interesting (and in some cases, even likable) characters, dramatically satisfying plotlines, and even some warmth and humor outside all the blood and death.",9,0,2,20 October 2003
Hellboy," Pretty darn good, and that's coming from someone who hates comic book (***)
","I'm not a fan of comic books (or most comic book movies), so I wasn't too interested in seeing 'Hellboy' until I heard that Guillermo del Toro was directing it. When it comes to dark and intense films about creepy-crawly things, he's one of the best ('The Devil's Backbone', 'Cronos', 'Mimic' and especially the awesome 'Blade II').The hero of this story was a baby demon who slipped through a portal to hell that was opened by Satan-worshipping Nazis at the end of WWII. Under the tutelage of the kindly human professor (John Hurt) who raised him, he became a crusader against evil. It's a ridiculous story, but no more ridiculous than most movies based on comic books, and the well-developed characters make it seem almost believable.Hellboy himself (played to perfection by Ron Perlman) is quite a fascinating character. Raised by humans, he struggles to be normal despite his gigantic muscles, red skin, and huge horns (that he sands down every morning). He also has a wickedly sarcastic sense of humor (after putting down one monster he says 'I'm fireproof. You're not.'), and his pining for a fellow freak named Liz (a melancholy human firestarter played with the right dark-eyed loneliness by Selma Blair) is touching.Even though the characters are the best thing about this movie, I found the story pretty compelling as well, as it seems far more influenced by the gothic horror of H.P. Lovecraft and Clive Barker than those cheesy Marvel comic stories.Lovecraft's influence in particular is present here, his indescribably creepy, gigantic, tentacled monsters waiting in some dark dimension for their chance to take over the world. Barker's work is felt in the sprawling hellscapes, satanic machinery, and a grisly reanimated corpse used as a puppet.In a nutshell, if you like lots of action mixed with the dark and grotesque (basically if you liked 'Blade II'), 'Hellboy' will probably do it for you. 'Spiderman' it ain't.",7,0,0,8 April 2004
School of Rock," Awesome - one of 2003's best (****)
","'The School Of Rock' is the movie I have been waiting to see for a long, long time. After years of empty, unimaginative music consistently topping the charts, I am thrilled that now there's a movie devoted to that music that has moved me like none other ever since I was a little kid...ROCK. Just in those 4 letters lies the whole truth to my universe. Sure, I listen to lots of other kinds of music (everything from blues to techno) but, as Jack Black might say, I will always return to rocking. And will this movie turn all today's kids who are brainwashed by Christina Aguilera and P. Diddy into cool rocking kids? Probably not. But definitely some. Jack Black, the wild-eyed madman who is one-half of the brilliant satirical rock band Tenacious D stars as Dewey Finn, a hotshot lead guitarist who is booted from his band for being an embarrassment, and is right on the edge of being kicked out of his apartment by his roommate, Ned (Mike White, who also wrote the script). When Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack), the principal of an expensive prep school, calls to offer a job to Ned (who is a substitute teacher), Dewey jumps at the opportunity to earn some money and accepts the job, posing as Ned. Dewey doesn't have much to teach the room of little middle-school kids he is faced with, but when he finds out that they are experienced musicians, he decides to form them into a rock band. It will take some work though, because these kids don't know Led Zeppelin from Liza Minelli.
Of course you can see exactly where this is going, but in a movie like this, its predictability actually makes it MORE entertaining, because if the kids didn't play their hearts out at the Battle Of The Bands and if the movie ended unhappily, that would suck and you know it. His style may not be to everyone's taste, but to me, Jack Black is a comic genius. Every yell, curve of his eyebrows, and spastic motion of his body is pure comedy heaven. And the kids are great too; smart, charismatic and funny, especially Joey Gaydos, who is an amazing guitarist (and he's 10!) and Robert Tsai as the shy keyboardist. This is a great movie, one of the best of the year, so go. And besides, is there anything cooler that a training montage set to the Ramones' 'My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)'? Nope, I don't think so.",10,0,0,19 October 2003
8 Mile," Familiar but enjoyable and believable (***)
","First of all, I should start by saying that I'm not the world's biggest Eminem fan. I've generally liked several of his songs (especially 'Stan'), but not enough of them to ever buy an album. That's not to say I don't respect him. He's smart, talented, and I like anybody who isn't afraid to ruffle some feathers. He also seems like the kind of performer who would have a natural ability to be a good actor, and from the first time I saw a trailer for '8 Mile', I knew that was the case.I wasn't wrong. Admittedly, you can argue that he's more-or-less playing an earlier version of himself, but this ain't no music video. Eminem is more than a capable actor, he's an excellent one, able to do what he's required to here, which is anchor the whole movie and impress a lot of people out there (fans included) who would so quickly be naysayers if he didn't do a great job.It also didn't hurt that he had a really good director (Curtis Hanson, of 'L.A. Confidential' and 'Wonder Boys') and cinematographer (Rodrigo Prieta, of 'Frida' and Spike Lee's upcoming '25th Hour') leading the way.Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., an aspiring rapper who goes by the nickname 'Rabbit'. He and his family are poor, living in a trailer park with an eviction notice on the door. His mother, Stephanie (Kim Basinger) is loving but selfish and a hard drinker. Also living in the trailer is Stephanie's pathetic white-trash boyfriend, Luke (Michael Shannon) and Rabbit's kid sister, Lily (Chloe Greenfield), who is the only family member he feels genuinely close with. Lily, his music, and his friends are the only things that really keep him going.This kind of believe-in-yourself, dreams-can-come-true plot won't be unfamiliar to anyone who has seen a few movies before, but by the end of the film, we suddenly realize that the issues at hand have become more complex and deeper than that simple outline.It's not perfect. It's a little too long, the climax is too drawn out, and some of the comic relief is kinda lame. But this is a movie you go to for the feeling, the performances and the little moments and scenes that make you go 'wow, this is really good'. '8 Mile' has lots of those.",Null,0,0,25 November 2002
Shrek 2," Ok, but nothing special (**1/2)
","I was one of the five people who didn't completely fawn over the original 'Shrek'. I thought there were parts that were hugely clever and funny and it was beautifully animated and had a good soundtrack, but as a whole I found it uninvolving and despite its engaging, carefree spirit, a bit dull.
'Shrek 2' is pretty much exactly the same. Beautiful animation, quirky rock and pop songs on the soundtrack including a cover of an old Buzzcocks song (!), and there are some very clever jokes. But Mike Myers' faux-Scottish accent is still annoying, Eddie Murphy's voice is still PROFOUNDLY annoying, and once again, the story itself is uninvolving for the most part.
'Shrek 2' picks up just after the honeymoon as Shrek and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are getting home. They receive an invitation from her parents (the King and Queen of Far, Far Away) to come home so they can meet her husband. So it's basically like 'Meet The Parents' with fairy tale characters. I think they could have been a little more creative.
There's also a complicated subplot about a scheming Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and her dim son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) that isn't interesting enough to go into. One good new character is Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas), a witty little cat who can disarm anyone by turning on his big, weepy kitten eyes. Hopefully for 'Shrek 3' they could get rid of Donkey (Murphy's irritating character) and keep Puss-In-Boots around. There are some good jokes scattered around, such as a TV show that's like 'Cops' called 'Knights' and a scene where a giant gingerbread man is attacking a Starbucks, and the people inside run out and take cover in...another Starbucks right across the street. And once again there's some good songs (by artists like Tom Waits, eels, Counting Crows, Frou Frou). But they blow that in the end, because of all the songs in the world, they actually choose 'Livin' La Vida Loca' as the closing number (did ANYONE EVER want to hear that song again?)
So it's smart and pretty funny in places, but like the original 'Shrek' there's just something not quite satisfying about it.",6,1,1,8 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," In a nutshell, the best movie I've seen in 5 years (****)
","The day I saw 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' was the first time I've ever seriously contemplated staying at the theater and seeing it again right afterwards. That's because it is literally so stuffed with cool stuff that it was hard to mentally process it all. I remember that at one point near the end, I was literally trembling with anticipation of what was about to happen.
Quentin Tarantino (writer and director of 3 great movies, 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jackie Brown', and 'Reservoir Dogs') returns after a 6 year absence and if you need any proof that he's still got the magic touch, this is it.
Unlike his other films, which were all witty, tough-talking crime dramas, 'Kill Bill' is a martial arts movie. The ultimate martial arts movie.
Uma Thurman plays The Bride (her real name is kept a mystery, and is humorously bleeped whenever anyone says it), a former assassin who is beaten and shot and left for dead on her wedding day by her old crew. She wakes up out of a coma 4 years later, escapes from the hospital and sets out on a mission of revenge against them, and especially against their leader, and her former lover, Bill (David Carradine). That story is pretty old, but a good martial arts movie doesn't need any more. I simply can't describe how good this movie is. I haven't been this involved in a movie, from scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment since, well, 'Pulp Fiction'. The two films are very different, but both have the same shifting time-line structure, bad-ass attitude and utterly brilliant soundtrack.
Speaking of that soundtrack, I don't think I've ever seen a movie with so many moments that are a PERFECT match between picture and sound.
The performances are, across the board, perfect. Everyone (including Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu and Daryl Hannah as her enemies) is completely convincing, but obviously, this is Uma's show. Her character is one of the best in the history of kick-ass, vengeance-seeking good guys. Every smile, cold stare, punch, kick, and tear running down her face you feel all the way down to your soul. Yes sir, QT's still got the touch. Not only is it the best of the year, it's the most invigorating, soul-stirring, heartbreaking, exciting, awe-inspiring FUN time I've had in a theater in many a moon. As most people know, 'Kill Bill' was originally intended to be one movie, but was nearly four hours long and was cut into two 'volumes'. This was the right decision, because 4 hours of this and my head might have exploded. Plus, believe me when I say that where it ends truly leaves you chomping at the bit for 'Vol. 2'.",10,5,10,19 October 2003
Big Fish," Somewhat disappointing but still very good (***)
","Tim Burton's thankful return to making films in his own style after the dull, ordinary 'Planet Of The Apes' remake in 2001, 'Big Fish' isn't quite the fantasy masterpiece I wanted it to be, but is quite good anyway.
Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is what you would call a storyteller. All his life he has dazzled everyone around him with tall tales about his own life at the drop of a hat, and they are always the right story for the situation. According to him, he has worked in a circus, traveled with a giant, braved a haunted forest, met a witch with a mystical glass eye, found an Eden-like town in the middle of a forest where everyone is always happy, and much, much more. Now, though, he is old, with cancer, and about to die.
His son, William (Billy Crudup), was once just as dazzled as everyone else at his stories, but over time grew tired of his father constantly hogging the spotlight with his silly stories and hasn't spoken to him in years. He leaves with his wife from his home in Paris to return home and try to reconcile with his father. The elder Bloom has always maintained that every word of his tall tales are absolutely true, that he really did do all those things, but William finally wants to hear the truth about his life. Edward, though, is still resolute that all those stories are true, and as we see those stories for ourselves (with a fresh-faced Ewan MacGregor as the young Edward), we begin to wonder (hope, actually) that some of it might be true. If ever there was a story that was perfect for Tim Burton ('Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood', 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure') to tell, this story, about the power of imagination, is it. However, something about it just didn't come together for me. Some of the stories just didn't engage me very much and at times the Burton-esque oddness seems a little forced.
But there are tons of good qualities, not the least of which are good performances by Finney, MacGregor, Crudup, Jessica Lange (as the elder Bloom's wife and William's mother), and Steve Buscemi (as a traveling poet). And I freely admit to crying my eyes out in the last 15 minutes, when the entire film comes together beautifully. Suddenly, right then, I felt the Tim Burton whose style I fell in love with in 'Edward Scissorhands' back when I was 12, and that, more than anything, made it worth seeing.",7,0,0,8 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Powerful and original (***1/2)
","Yet another mind-boggling and inventive screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, who specializes in multi-layered stories that whimsically examine human identity, 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' is about the idea of memory erasure. Following a passionate but disastrous love affair, Joel (Jim Carrey) finds out that his ex, Clementine (Kate Winslet) went to a new organization called Lacuna, Inc. to have her memory of him erased. Angry and hurt, he decides to retaliate and have his memory of HER erased as well. As he did with Spike Jonze, Kaufman is working with a director here who does a great job of expressing his strange ideas visually. This time, it's Michel Gondry, who like Jonze has directed some of the most creative music videos of all time (Gondry's repertoire includes Bjork's dreamlike 'Army Of Me' and the Chemical Brothers' optical illusion-riddled 'Let Forever Be').
While Joel undergoes the procedure, most of the movie takes place inside his head (which allows for Gondry to give us plenty of bizarre, surrealistic visuals), as he is made to relive his memories with Clementine before they're erased. Going back to the good times, he of course realizes he doesn't want them to be erased, but it's too late. All he can do is savor the memories before they're gone, which is a heartbreaking situation.
Meanwhile, in the real world, an interesting little story of its own is developing among the memory technicians working on Joel (played by the interesting group of actors Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood). 'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' (the title is a quote from a poem by Alexander Pope) is not for everyone. It's a strange, confusing and unconventional film, but those with an open mind will love those qualities, and recognize its originality, excellent performances (Carrey has never been better), and unpredictability. The only slight flaw I can think of is that it feels a little too long, but that might just be a result of so many twists and turns that it's hard to mentally process it all. Not for all tastes, but I highly recommend it for people who like their movies to actually surprise and challenge them.",8,0,1,28 March 2004
The Last Samurai," Awesome (****)
","Akira Kurosawa's 1954 masterpiece 'Seven Samurai' is one of my favorite films of all time. The word 'samurai' is in my e-mail address. So I like this kind of movie. Still, for some reason I wasn't expecting much from this film. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that Tom Cruise playing a samurai, much as I like him, struck me as less-than-promising. Whatever the case, I'm glad I went, because not only is it good, it is one HELL of an amazing film. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a Civil War veteran who is known publicly as a 'war hero', but he is not proud of it. He is an alcoholic and is haunted by the memory of the war, particularly being ordered to slaughter innocent Native Americans. His new job is to go to Japan and train the Emperor's troops to wipe out the last of the country's samurai culture. In the first battle, though, he is taken prisoner by the samurai troops, led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Over a period of several months being their prisoner, Nathan gradually begins to understand their way of life and respect their dedication to honor and nature, and for probably the first time since before the war, he feels like he belongs somewhere. 'The Last Samurai' is, without a doubt, one of the most visually impressive films of the year. There are many shots that are simply stunning in their beauty, and even if some of them were computer generated, I didn't care. Even in the indoor scenes, the cinematography is perfect. The battle sequences are thrilling and terrifying, and the mournful, emotive score by Hans Zimmer evokes memories of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.
So on the surface, the film is pretty much perfect. Which would be pretty cool on its own, but thankfully the film goes deeper. It takes its time detailing Algren's slow change of mind. It feels realistic because we know that this man had literally nothing but pain in his life, and found something new to live for in samurai culture. Another one of the film's main assets is the moving friendship that slowly evolves between Cruise's and Watanabe's characters. Cruise is very good as usual, but it's Watanabe's breathtakingly passionate performance that gives the film its heart and soul. When these two characters, who began the film diametrically opposed, work together and understand each other, it made me think of the great friendships in the action films John Woo used to make before he became just another Hollywood director. So is there anything in 'The Last Samurai' that you haven't seen before? Probably not. But I can tell you that this is about as good as epic, mainstream Hollywood filmmaking gets. It's enormously exciting, suspenseful, fast-paced, it has a number of great characters, and it engages all the right emotions at all the right moments without being too manipulative.
You could argue that it's not all that deep (and I might even agree), but there are certainly resonant themes of honor, self-discovery, the death of unfairly outmoded cultures, and the absurdity of war. It's about all those things, but mainly it's about serving you up a great, involving story, and there it definitely succeeds.",10,1,2,12 December 2003
Mystic River," The emperor's not wearing any clothes (**)
","Well, I hate to have to say that 'the emperor's not wearing any clothes', but with all the critical acclaim that this half-baked, mediocre movie is getting, it's necessary.Not that it's bad, it's not. Just cold, plodding, and unfulfilling, and it has a twist ending that is more than a little ridiculous.Jimmy, Dave, and Sean are 3 kids growing up in Boston and are close friends. Then one day, as they're playing in the street, Dave is abducted by two men posing as police officers and sexually abused for several days.The story then moves into present day, with Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon playing the characters as adults. They all still live in the general area, but are no longer close friends, having grown apart over the years and going down different paths. Jimmy is a former hoodlum trying to put the past behind him. Dave is now a husband and father, but a hunched wreck of a man as a result of his childhood trauma. Sean is a cop with an estranged wife who keeps calling up (a useless subplot).After doing a good job setting up the characters and locale, the movie becomes a murder mystery when Jimmy's teenage daughter is found shot at bludgeoned to death.It's tough for me to be too hard on this movie, because the cast (which also includes Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden, and for about 5 minutes, Laura Linney) is so terrific, and all of them give great performances, especially Robbins. The score is good, the cinematography is good, hell, even the TITLE sounds like it should be a great movie....but it's not.The most obvious flaw is that the story moves at about the speed of a glacier. I was very into it at first, but somewhere over the course of its 137 minutes, I went from paying close attention to the story to admiring the ceiling of the theater.Second, even though the actors do a great job of playing the characters, the whole thing still felt hollow to me. Apart from one scene where Penn breaks down on his porch, I didn't really FEEL anything for any of these characters (except maybe Robbins). It's a very cold, distant movie, which I totally didn't expect.Most damaging of all though is the climax. Without giving anything away, the explanation of how everything happened at the end is completely ridiculous, using coincidence to an extreme that is almost insulting. That's more a fault of the book it's based on than anything, but it's still a lame finish for a movie that seemed like it was saving all its energy for the climax.It's not one of the worst movies of the year or anything, but it's absolutely one of the most disappointing.",5,0,1,24 October 2003
Love Actually," Hit-and-miss, but the last 30 minutes are PERFECT (***)
","Richard Curtis, the guy who wrote the screenplays for several classic British comedies ('Four Weddings And A Funeral', 'Notting Hill', 'Bridget Jones's Diary') wrote and also directed 'Love Actually', and with it, has set out to make the Ultimate Romantic Comedy. It even says so on the poster.It's over 2 hours long, it's crammed with several different storylines, well over a dozen main characters (most of whom know each other in some way), and has numerous subplots, some of which add depth and others that take it away. Yes, it definitely wants to be the 'Magnolia' of romantic comedies. And...it doesn't really succeed. But it's a valiant effort.Although I do have to say that it certainly does LOOK like the Ultimate Romantic Comedy. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.I'm not even going to try to summarize all those storylines, so I'll just say that it has an all-star cast including Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley and many others.Some of the storylines are very enjoyable, but others could have been cut completely and wouldn't have been missed. And it's that kind of constant teetering, between the interesting stories and the not-so-interesting stories that makes this ambitious film fall far, far short of being the 'Ultimate Romantic Comedy'. Not to mention the many dry spots and flat jokes.That said, the last half hour or so of 'Love Actually' is about as perfect as a movie of this kind can get. All the stories are drawn together and concluded in a way that is very moving and satisfying. And I fell for it, what can I say? Sometimes, you just gotta surrender to the warm-fuzzies.It's nothing too special, and it certainly doesn't compare to some other recent British comedies, like 'About A Boy' or 'Bend It Like Beckham', but it's pretty enjoyable, has wonderful cinematography, a good soundtrack, and some nice Christmas spirit. So there ya go. It's more or less worth it.",6,0,2,22 November 2003
Man on Fire," Inconsistent script + style overkill = Underwhelming (**)
","A shifty script and style overkill drowns this over-the-top kidnapping story. Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, an alcoholic former Marine predictably haunted by the past who reluctantly accepts a job in Mexico City as bodyguard to a little girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning).
The first half of the movie, which is about Pita gradually drawing Creasy out of his shell, is ok. Washington is his old reliable self and Fanning once again proves to be one of the best child actors working.
Then, Pita is kidnapped and apparently killed. Creasy swears to the family that he'll kill everyone responsible. Fun! Director Tony Scott has two great movies under his belt (1992's 'True Romance' and 1995's 'Crimson Tide'), but this film goes on the pile of his other style-over-substance movies. In 'Man On Fire' Scott experiments with all sorts of crazy film and sound techniques (even the subtitles don't stand still), which is pretty cool for about 30 minutes. After that, it feels annoying and manipulative, because it's obviously just there to distract from the very ordinary story.
What's most troubling is the fact that Creasy's character goes from being a human being in the first half to being a sadistic vengeance machine out of a Chuck Norris movie in the second. If it was a good movie, it might examine what makes Creasy nearly as ruthless and vicious as the people he's after, but instead it just paints him as some sort of big, cuddly, moral hero. We're supposed to love him because he reads the Bible and because Pita names her teddy bear after him (aww!). Probably a good thing she can't see her Creasy-bear cutting off fingers, ears, and blowing people up.
It's not a terrible movie - the acting is pretty good, and the cinematography is good when the editors aren't trying to give you an epileptic seizure. But this is an overlong and brutal movie (that fails to examine its brutality) and it leaves a sour taste in your mouth, no matter how much they try to cover it up with 'Gladiator'-style singing on the soundtrack.",5,11,23,8 June 2004
The Terminal," Spielberg and Hanks or no, this movie stinks (**)
","Whenever I'm watching a movie like 'The Terminal', and all I can do is shake my head and roll my eyes while most of the audience laughs and claps, I always wonder if I'm just being a grump. Then I remember that, no, I don't consider myself a cynic, so it's something wrong with the movie. And boy, is there a lot wrong with this movie. The first 30-40 minutes are actually quite good. Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, an immigrant from a fictional Eastern European country named Krakohzia who finds himself with an invalid passport upon his arrival in New York, and since he cannot set foot on America soil without a working passport, he is confined to the airport for an indeterminate time period. Hanks is, of course, great, and the swooping camerawork that follows him through the gigantic terminal with all the flashing lights, fast food and souvenir stores is excellent. We can feel Viktor's confusion and helplessness, and the hints he picks up about how to make life in an airport more tolerable are amusing. Then the movie begins to wander, aimlessly. Lame subplots are brought in to pass the time, like Viktor playing matchmaker for a friendly airport employee (Diego Luna) and a predictably tough-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside INS agent (Zoe Saldana). This subplot is weak to begin with, then is dropped entirely for nearly an hour before wrapping up in a nauseatingly cutesy way. That's the other major problem: the sappiness. Spielberg's always been eager to lay on the sappiness in many of his films, and it really kills 'The Terminal'. A very good and intelligent film could have been made with this story and cast (which also includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride and Kumar Pallana), but after the promising beginning it heads right into sappy, cliched, unrealistic nonsense. Interestingly, it's loosely based on the true story of Iranian refugee Merhan Nasseri's experiences at France's Charles De Gaulle airport. I'm guessing that's VERY loosely. That is, unless Nasseri became a working class hero for the staff, had fun foiling the fussy jerk in head of security (Tucci) and had a starry-eyed romance with a flaky stewardess (Zeta-Jones) complete with cornball speeches in front of a gleaming, hand-made water fountain. Yeah yeah, I know it's supposed to be whimsical. I still say there's a big difference between whimsy (which requires intelligence and a light touch) and a movie like 'The Terminal' which irritatingly condescends to the audience by turning what could have been a fascinating film into a pandering, phony, mush-fest. Hanks and Zeta-Jones are both quite good, but the movie itself is a huge waste of time. After the overrated 'Catch Me If You Can' and this mess, maybe Spielberg should stay away from comedy.",4,1,7,4 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Wow. (****)
","I really liked 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' back in 2001, but was slightly disappointed in 'The Two Towers' the following year. I liked it, but compared to the first one it felt a little ho-hum. Not as enthralling an experience. My point is that I'm hardly a 'Lord Of The Rings' geek, so I approached this third and final installment expecting it to be pretty good, but not expecting it to blow me out of my chair. Which it did.
One of the most thrilling and breathtaking experiences I've ever had in a movie theater, 'The Return Of The King' may be the most important film I've ever seen to SEE ON A BIG SCREEN. It is an indescribable feeling to be immersed so thoroughly in director Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's richly imagined land of Middle Earth. There are many sights in this film (many involving the fantastical Minas Tirith, City Of Kings) that are truly astounding. Even details like the ever-present mountains and misty, gray clouds in the background are a spectacular sight on that big screen. The story continues. Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), and the tormented, scheming creature Gollum are on their way to Mount Doom to finally destroy the cursed ring. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) must defend Minas Tirith against a final onslaught of hundreds of thousands of Orcs. This time, Astin's heroic Sam and fellow Hobbit benchwarmer character Pippin (Billy Boyd) actually have stuff to contribute to the story, as Sam steps up, surprisingly, to be one of the saga's most admirable heroes. And who knew Sean Astin had such a brilliant performance in him?
There is amazing cinematography, a HUGE and beautiful score to go with it, probably the best (certainly the biggest and most breathtakingly visualized) battle sequence ever filmed, a terrifying giant spider, characters dangling by their fingertips from huge heights, resonant themes of love and honor and death... Basically everything you could possibly want in an epic adventure. And then some.",10,2,4,8 January 2004
Dodgeball," Hit-and-miss, but basically a good time (**1/2)
","Is this movie stupid? Yes. Are there tons of jokes and lines that fall flat? Yes. But is it painful? No. And is it pretty damn funny in places and does it have lots of fun characters? Definitely. The title pretty much says it all here. It's about dodgeball, and in the great tradition of sports comedies like 'Caddyshack', it's also a class struggle, about the underdogs vs. the rich ***holes. I thought I was getting tired of Ben Stiller, but he's great here as playing a send-up of the typical villain in those types of movies. It's a lot of fun to watch him with puffed-up blondish hair, a Leather-Man-from-the-Village-People mustache, and an affected 'tough' speaking tone play the kind of idiotic bad guy we all love to hate. 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' isn't a great movie, or anything even approaching that, but it does work more than you expect it to, and it's more or less worth plunking down the change.",6,0,0,4 July 2004
