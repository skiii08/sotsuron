Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks was great, even if they did change events a bit for drama
","Captain Phillips, the gut-wrenching story of a merchant vessel captain taken captive by Somali pirates, who was rescued by a Navy SEAL team in the Gulf of Aden. Some moments of high drama, with a little PC nod to how rough it is for young Somali thrown in (probably close to true). The take-down of the pirates was great action, but was far enough from what actually happened that it sort of spoiled it for me (sorry if this spoils it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie), but is still a great movie to watch, as it does give a good sense of the danger to world merchant shipping from piracy. Some great nods in the flick to the commercial greed that motivates the practice. Great shots of Navy ships and personnel in action.",8,0,2,12 October 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Best Avenger movie yet
","When nations get together and decide the Avengers need to be supervised rather than allowed to fight evil on their own terms, it causes a split in the group. The Iron Man leads the group that joins the government, but Captain America refuses to surrender his independence and leads a group that is going its own way in pursuit of an evil man who is using psychological control to deploy terrorists.The dialogue is a bit hokey in places, but, that's the beauty of the Avenger movies, it's about a more innocent time when such hokey dialogue was the way people really talked. Lots of extra characters in this one, including an African king's son who is a cat figure with amazing powers, and Spider Man, an adolescent fighting with the grownups. While this one is typical Marvel action, there are also some philosophical messages skillfully inserted in this, the best Avenger movie yet.",9,1,4,1 January 2017
