Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Somewhat different and better than Vol. 1
","Let me start by saying that Vol. 1 was quite a disappointment for me. I believe it was so because of the 'ultra' high ratings that it received but when I saw it I did't share the enthusiasm. I just expected something different.And before I saw Vol. 2 I kind of already knew what to expect. Well I am glad to admit that I think I finally see why film fans are praising Tarantino the way they are. He really is a master in making us see into the hearts of violent people. I like Vol. 2 more because there are more dialogs and a better more complete style in the storytelling.I must shamefully admit that I have not yet seen Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown and yes I saw just the first 15 minutes of Pulp Fiction. But despite the lack in seeing Tarantino films I think I have seen enough of other good films to say that Vol. 2 is masterly directed with a good use of special FX, intense fighting scenes and a nice add of crude humor......... 4/5 ........",8,0,1,28 April 2005
In Bruges," Hit men with a conscience.
","Great, sad, brutal, funny, pardon me, I meant f***n' funny, are the first things that I can think of just after seeing this quite simple but effective movie. As the title says In Bruges, the story is set in a medium-sized Belgium town with a very rich historical background, an earthly paradise for tourists of a more 'cultural' type. Just one of the last places on earth where you would put a story that involves professional hit men.'Bruges dangerous' doesn't seem to make any sense, but there are enough elements thrown in that make this concept work so well, you almost wish to go there someday for yourself. But let's face it, off-screen Bruges itself must really be kind of boring if you are not a 'cultural' fan, that's why it is apt to throw in American dwarfs, movie scenes, prostitutes, drug dealers, some of the crudest humor you can think of, etc, all that to go with those Gothic churches and make the story more exciting to follow.But what also makes it appealing is that our two protagonists, especially Farrel with his bleak feelings, almost couldn't blend better with the cold, dark and depressive atmosphere of the town. But like most good comedies this film also builds it's story on certain contrasts. And the main contrasts that seems to exists is this notion of hit men that have a sort of a conscience, which is what it's all about. And I have to say that at times this idea does seem a little unbelievable, but without it the bleakness and guilt would disappear, the atmosphere wouldn't have it's effect and the story would have to be mostly rewritten.Yet this is clearly not a motion picture for everyone, since the R rating is very much in place. It isn't always a plus, because there seems to be just a scene or two that is almost ridiculously violent and that mildly spoils the otherwise very, very thoughtful story.",8,0,2,12 October 2008
Iron Man 2," A sequel that doesn't bet on 'twice the action' formula.
","This is one of the very few blockbuster franchises that I have followed so far. I usually see them fast, or I don't see them at all. And following the Iron Man franchise has 'payed off', so far. But this part is different and does feel different than the first, and for some reason it's not so easy to immediately answer why exactly.The first thing that came to mind is that despite the bigger budget of the second part, the 'level' and the time of action is the same if not shorter than in 'Iron Man 1'. I never thought that I will ever caught myself thinking that there should be more action and less talking in a so-called 'summer film'.The real substitute for all the chasing, shooting and blowing up that is a bit missing in this film, is an array of new characters. The constant talking of everyone, especially Tony Stark of course, gives the film a dynamic pace and probably makes those 2 hours go by much quicker. But from my view, the most silent character of all, Vanko, was the most interesting one.What is also specific for the Iron Man franchise and many of this kind of big films of the new millennium, is the skillful adding of 'counter-culture' elements in a very mainstream product. This part left me down here quite a bit. The first trailer for the film had me thinking and hoping that we'll see some kind of a critique of war-profiteering and that it will all lead us to a path of at least some moral dilemmas. But sadly, all of Vanko's motives for vengeance are reduced to some old family rivalry. I guess it is (still?) too much to ask for more from a king-size summer opening film like this.",8,7,12,15 May 2010
Madagascar," 'I like ta move it, move it'
","Four animals. A jumpy, frisky and at times a bit beastly lion, a frisky, talkative, adventuress zebra, a chubby, witty and goodhearted hypo and a bit apathetic and indecisive giraffe. Wow. Feels like I know them already. And just like us they live their daily routine. And just like us, one of these animals(?) starts to feel the urge to change that routine. To see and feel the outside world, to go to the WILD!Now really I'm not a big fan of computer animated films. In the last 5 or more years I've only seen a few of these sort of flicks and today I've realized a really funny thing. All of the movies I've seen were produced by Dream Works(Antz, Shrek, Shrek 2 and now Madgascar). How and why is this so, is beyond me. Madagascar came into my hands by pure coincidence. OK, just to let you know that I'm still new to this. I could place Madagascar as my favorite of those films, though I wasn't purely nuts about any of them (both Shreks were a bit of a disappointment). There are still a few unconvincing things to it like the humor for instance. It seemed slightly too familiar, predictable and boring at times, but at least the characters had some real life in them. There were also a couple of parts that really didn't seem to fit all well together, especially towards the end with the lion. Oh yes the lion. Now I can kind of understand what some critics meant when they said that Shrek has a lot of adult humor in it. At times the lion didn't seem like the hungriest beast in the wild but more like the horniest. :) An interesting resemblance........ - 4/5 .......",7,0,0,26 August 2005
Black Book," It should have been on several kinds of top movies lists.
","I saw it minutes ago, I know it's not very 'objective' to write comments right after seeing a film, but here we are commentators, not established critics. I was sure I would find this in the Top 250, but I was a bit negatively surprised, again.Before seeing it I didn't know what it was exactly about, I just knew that it's a story at the time of World War II. I really did not expect such a gripping and twisted thriller, more of a drama and luckily you get all of it. There are moments when you are at the edge of your seat because of the brutality between the Germans and the Dutch resistance, the filmmakers do not spare much with the violence. I haven't seen exactly every movie about WW II, but this one is such that it can really make you squeeze your teeth when you think of the Germans at that time. But I wouldn't say it's in any way offensive of Germans, because by the time of the third part, it seems that the blood is on each and everyones hands.The story is really one of the most intriguing ones I've seen in a long time. And everything is enriched with the acting, for which the main credits go to Carice van Houten as Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries. Speaking just out of the blue, she seems to have buckets of talent and if she can handle this, she can handle anything. The supporting cast as well. This film really seems like a quite heavy thing to pull of so authentically as it was. In the end it made me feel exhausted and shaken.There is also one other thing that is worth mentioning, and that is that this film is not American, which shows a lot in the way it's made. There are scenes that are those by-the-way scenes, pulled of so easily and naturally, but you would probably never see them in a Hollywood picture with similar content. Think of the conversation between Ellis and Ronnie in the toilette, to give just one example. It's true that a lot of American films are adult-oriented dramas, but in a different style than European films. But this kind of difference of European cinema is just another plus in my opinion. All I can say is that Zwartboek is simply a 'two thumbs up', to express myself in the usual critical manner.",8,2,6,10 October 2008
Constantine," Not really that good
","I saw this at a theater last night and it really didn't deliver anything unexpected or yet unseen for me. Though the cast was well chosen, Keanu Reeves was still just plain old Keanu Reeves. He didn't really offer me anything new with the role of John Constantine. Rachel Weisz was in place, her role was probably the best and the most believable from the entire cast. I couldn't say the same for Djimon Hounsou's role as Midnite. It's probably not all his fault. It wasn't an easy one. Angel Gabriel and Lucifer could and should be left out in this movie. Their addition to the film is a reduction of the potential thrills that the movie has. It just makes the film look kind of ridiculous. The main thing I kind of resent this film is the way it handles it's main issue. I don't' know the comic book, but the film would have been so much better if it would be less direct and more mystical or even a bit 'careful' about handling a theme that from the start isn't all that convincing. I'll probably pop it a 5 or a 6...... +2/5 .....",5,1,4,10 April 2005
Brokeback Mountain," A very good depiction of how individuals are being eradicated by society.
","You almost can't believe it when you hear it for the first time. Somebody made a gay western with two mainstream Hollywood actors in it. First you think they've gone nuts. That it's probably going to end their careers faster than a first-rate video game stinker, ala Street Fighter. I guess at some point anybody that approximately knew what the film was about either thought it'll get bashed and laughed at, or that it'll be somehow ignored and quickly forgotten by the general audience. Meaining that it's just going to be another mediocre socio-drama. Now that the word 'Brokeback' is (so I read) the most frequently said and searched word when it comes to movies of 2005, the last thesis seems to be just plain old dumb. Meaning that the movie wasn't by any chance ignored by the general audience, nor forgotten by that matter.No, it was more or less ignored by a well-known, some would say the most credible institution in the world of motion pictures. At least on the points I find to be most deserving. Brokeback Mountain, really is something new in many viewpoints. It's hardly the second Ang Lee's film I've seen so far. The first one was The Ice Storm. He really seems to have many talent in the point of depicting the microcosms of society. Families and individuals.This time he sends us to the middle of nowhere to confront us with one of the most disagreeable subjects. In the middle he puts two ordinary, lower-middle class men who just want to make some decent money. Lonely, wistful and kind of bored they become very close and one night they do something for which they both claim to be just a 'one-shot thing'. After their painful split, they go on with their lives as if nothing happened. All this time they feel forced by society and obliged by their families to hide an important part of their love-lives. So they do. And this is what the movie is best at. In showing how people want something so badly and yet they hate it and reject it because they want to look 'normal' in front of everybody. They're well aware that they most likely wont receive a shred of understanding from anyone. 'Brokeback' can become a hated and misunderstood film if watched under the influence of prejudice. A part of the male audience will feel very unsettled and provoked by the hair-splitting depiction of the two 'family men'. So before seeing it, 'preparing' yourself wouldn't be such a bad idea. You will enjoy it and even understand it a lot more if you try to be a bit open-minded. To me it's not a 'gay movie'. It's a vibrant statement about a society that lauds ideals and who's individuals are completely unwilling to except something they are unable to determine. Yes it's a movie for all of us and about all of us cowards......... +4/5 ........",8,25,29,14 March 2006
Crash," Not a huge newness in the abundant world of movies but still very good.
","As it's already well known, the occurrence is set in contemporary Los Angeles. Here we are pinned to the short and also contemporary stories of a few individuals that come from various ends of society. And somehow their everyday lives cross or should I say crash over each other because of numerous and coincidental events. A series of events, reactions and counter reactions determine the stories pace and direction.You never know who is the next person you are going to crash into. Throughout the story the only person that seems to be the nexus of all these incidents is an official called Graham (Don Cheadle). Despite his ignorance considering the causes of most events, he is the starting-point to almost every character in the film. The heart of the story rotates around the attempt to expose the duality of each and every person involved in a certain situation. On one side of the medal the characters are shown as cold, racist, annoying, angry, on the other side, the position they found them self's into stimulates them to act unselfishly, kindly, openly and make a few hard self-sacrifices.I've had high hopes before seeing this film. I expected something more dramatic, more serious and more complex. Astonishingly there is a good deal of humor and cynicism in some parts. And unfortunately a good deal of clichés too. The dialogs could use some sharpening in the sense of memorizing them. I also think that it's a bit too much involved in the general stereotypes about each race. But ultimately the film proves that those exact stereotypes, no matter how stupid we think they are, are the main reason for racial intolerance.What I also could not fully digest is the periodic notion that I am watching a TV-film and not a big screen release. Maybe it had something to do with the 'look' of the film. But don't worry about that. Even the most fanatic visual-technical freak will gradually skip that aspect and get pulled in the series of deeply moving scenes. And hands down to each and every actor. To me it is almost impossible to pick the absolute best performance. It's one of last years best movies, though far from perfect, you will remember it for the edginess of it's characters. And also for the accuracy in modifying and converting their tones......... 4/5 ........",8,0,4,11 March 2006
Tropic Thunder," Perhaps it's a little 'too American' to be really funny for a worldwide audience.
","I'm not from the US, but I admit I had a few good laughs while watching this at a theater the other day. But there were just these few quite good laughs, probably not more than five. It made me think that the film is a bit 'too American', it happened quite a few times when something was supposed to be funny and people didn't take it as such. One good example is the 'DVD comment' from Downey Jr., people didn't laugh much, probably because they didn't get it. There are more of these examples, but I don't want to mark my comment with spoiler alerts. Or sometimes people laugh at the accent and not at what't actually said.A lot of the jokes get 'lost in translation' if you are not American and if you read subtitles. The other problem in my opinion is that there isn't a peak laugh, or a really big laugh in the end. Because of that I think a lot of people left the theater a bit disappointed. When I saw such high marks for this film I was a little negatively surprised. It almost seemed to me that I didn't watch the same movie. Some would argue that despite the lack of grand laughs in the end it's 'overall' funny, but in my view, more mildly.",6,0,1,8 October 2008
Garden State," For me... just a good flick... I liked it
","I've just done seeing Garden State about twenty minutes ago and I must say it was a very feel good experience but it just isn't the kind of movie that I will remember for ages.It reminds me of a few independent films from the eighties that had a similar content or were all displaying the life of twenty something year olds or students and all that. It's a fine first step for Braff as the director. Natalie Portman was also very amazing and gave the film that really 'seize your life' kind of felling even though she wasn't the main 'screwup' in this film.The biggest surprise for me was the tiny role done by Method Man. Now that I did not expect. But surprisingly he didn't screwup the film in any way.Overall in my opinion I will not remember this film for ages and ages but it still gave me that warm felling that usually only comes from seeing good, solid Indies........ +3/5 .......",7,0,2,30 April 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Not for a careless viewer. In terms of politics and history of course.
","George Clooney's second fully-length feature takes on a past but remarkably present theme of protecting the civil liberties in an otherwise democratic state. We see him perform the role of a CBS producer Frank Friendly who worked on the early 1950's show, hosted by Edward R. Murrow. Murrow was a broadcast journalist on CBS and an open critic of the internal politics of that time's senator, Joseph McCarthy. He made history with his approximately half an hour long show in which he aired his thoughts on the senator's stands on communism. He also reported about the otherwise obscure stories of civil liberty violations that were a result of the senator's activities.I was stunned by Murrow's prefatory speech that happened a few years after his bold activity on CBS. Talking about the obvious but strangely concealed always sounds stunning when it comes from people of his type. David Strathairn gave an incredible performance and made me wish to see more of these kind of shows where a cigarette smoking commentator provokes your thoughts on the up-to-date topics. Seeing it in black&white makes the film feel more unbiased. Overall, people who see movies for sheer entertainment and who are more or less unaware of past and present events in politics don't need my warning. Like some movies, this one doesn't market itself like it's something else than what it is, meaning that it's pretty much what you might expect but well executed. It's a small possibility that the 'wrong' kind of viewer will see it. It can seem boring at times but it was worth the attention because of Murrow's lucid and consistent criticism. Good night, and good luck......... 4/5 ........",8,1,2,24 April 2006
The Dark Knight," Honestly, I haven't felt this excited in a theater since The Matrix
","I will let out the synopsis of the film this time, since almost everyone knows it. Instead I would just like to simply express some of my impressions. First off, I think the best thing about this film is not 'The Joker' as many say, but the short little moments when Nolan, Ledger, Hans Zimmer & James N. Howard (the composers), join their forces and create these little tense and anxious moments that are slowly rising the tension and leave you in limbo. Anxiety contrary to phobia, as you may know, means the absence of a feared object and the anticipation of something. My personal favorite: the scene with the Joker and Rachel at Wayne's party. And there are a few more. I think the instrument that is used during these scenes is some sort of a horn and it's getting slightly louder and louder and joined by other instruments, combined with the actual happening in the film of course.And a few words about the Joker. If I would describe him it would be excessive enthusiasm, pathos, or even immortality. There are two opposite situations where you can't possibly put the Joker, because he wouldn't be the Joker anymore. One situation is being dead, the other is waking up. Why? Because when people are waking up they are always serious, I can imagine the Joker sleeping and snoring, it would still look kind of funny, waking up no. Except if it would happen extremely fast, with the speed of light. The Joker is always in FULL conscience, contrary when we are waking up we are in these states of, how would I say it, vulnerability. We can easily start to ask ourselves about what is the purpose of our doing, the meaning of our life, etc... And that is the last thing that a psychotic villain like the Joker would do. Try to imagine it for yourselves. Ledger played him 100 percent proper.There are so many more things I could say about this film. All the elements just seem to collide, there are basically no big flops in my opinion. I just don't give 10's very often, I don't know exactly why, It's just this 'rule' I have and I'm quite invariable about it. I think the film has to be 'tested', viewed many times before you can consider it perfect and in time you might change your opinion and I would feel stupid if I would go from 10 to 9 later or something like that.",9,3,11,7 October 2008
Green Street Hooligans," Pretty powerful but the plot is a bit shaky.
","Matt Buckner is a student of journalism at Harvard University. One day he lets his roommate talk him into dropping out of college just to help him protect the reputation of his family. Matt drops out just a couple of months before his degree and receives a nice amount of money for doing it, letting his wealthy pal get the easy way out. Therefor Matt decides to pay a visit to his sister and her husband in London whom he hasn't seen in three years.It's here that he meets his brother-in-law's brother who lours him into hanging out with his friends who are all members of a 'firm' called The GSE. Matt feels pretty aimless because of the lack in having any real goals in life right now. So therefor we see a good case of slipping deeper and deeper into a truly restless crowd and joining their activities. The film is rich with really good performances and uncompromising depiction of gang violence. There's hardly any holding back on that part. The whole thing about 'hooligans' looks even more realistic than most documentaries on the subject. But I couldn't get rid of the sense that the plot is a bit fetched if not ridiculous. That rings somewhere in the back of your head all the time.I mean it's a little hard to believe that some student would get affiliated with a crowd like that so quickly. And the whole American-Brit relationship seemed a bit dated if not a little pathetic. But despite the shaky premise it succeeds wonderfully in making you see how pointless it is to keep getting involved in violence. In that point of view the film is easily comparable to genre gems such as American History X. Who knows, maybe one day this film will be shown across high schools to kids at sociology........ - 4/5 .......",7,0,0,21 July 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Very good and on a par with 'Malkovich'
","You just have to see it at least twice to appreciate it. It's the talk of the town that movies based on Charlie Kaufman scripts are not for everyone. One of the better qualities of the movie is that you might not expect it to be a sci-fi. It's full of surprises. I've heard people walked out on it in theaters, probably expecting another mediocre Jim Carrey comedy. Too bad for them.It's not as dark as Being John Malkovich, though it is deeper. The two main characters do not seem as neurotic as their Kaufman based 'predecessors'. Although they are still insecure, somewhat in doubt and 'looking for their own piece of mind'. That's why we like them so much. Their seemingly insignificant inner characteristics can be easily exposed to a two hour 'investigation'. And that's pretty much what all the movies that have been written by Charlie Kaufman are about. Each time, the audience is sent on a brief inner expedition, into a not so prominent individual. Besides the story it is all enriched with excellent music. A calm little tune is played every now and then that makes the whole thing more memorable. After it's all said and done a mix of bitter-sweet sensation takes you over. And you feel the need for love, like the eternal sunshine......... +4/5 ........",8,0,2,17 February 2006
The Last Samurai," It fitted my expectations
","The first time I've seen this movie is now almost a year and a half ago. I saw it in a theater with a friend. I probably wouldn't go see it if it weren't for the buzz that it received on this website. At the end the outcome was a lot like I expected it to be. No I was certainly not disappointed but comments like 'absolutely perfect' or 'flawless' would not likely come out of my mouth.The Last Samurai is a rather 'hollywoodized' representation of the changes in Japan that took place in the second half of the 19th century. The first half of the film I thought that a more detailed depiction of the 'leap' to a more modern Japanese society will be neglected. Later on we see that the samurai were also an important part of the Japanese society at that time and that they were not entirely excluded in participating at important discussions.What I also mean by 'hollywoodized' in this film is the exposure of the samurai lifestyle and the relationship between Nathan Algren (Cruise) and the samurai. I think that is the most important part of the film. I found Cruise's convalescence, his view and his adaption to the new lifestyle rather clichéd and stereotypical. I thought I've seen it all before.You can call me petty but I think the films biggest plus are the battle-scenes. They were carried out with a lot of attention to the viewer and everything about them was amazing from sound to costumes. I will remember this film particularly because of that. I saw the movie again three days ago on DVD and I realized that I forgot most of the dialog and the content. I even found them more clichéd and ordinary than before. But I still thought that the battle-scenes were amazing or even more amazing than I did before........ - 4/5 .......",7,1,2,3 June 2005
The Descent," A definite improvement compared to directors previous work. Could have been even scarier, but I'm glad it wasn't.
","Sounds kind of familiar: a group of cave explorers goes on a cave trip in which they find out that they are the first people to ever walk through it. Then comes the line: 'I think I saw something' and we are off to a suspenseful, chasing blood fest. The directors previous film had a practically exact same plot, where a group of soldiers was hunted by a pack of hungry were-wolfs. The one thing I really 'hate' about horror films is when they're full of sudden scary scenes. This one is full of them.The film has a really good premise where there's a woman named Sarah that's full of grief for her lost family, especially her daughter. Her tragic loss resonates through her life and pushes her in extremely horrifying resurrections of that fatal event. This is the scariest part of the film. Now the director isn't really good in making the beasts in his films that scary. This time he merely succeeds in making it so, though it doesn't come close to the psy-terror of Sarah's odd syndromes.This time the boys are girls and they act like super-girls which is kind of a let down and looks like another Alien series recycle. I thought the film's plot would spin around Sarah's fears and make the rest of the team get swallowed in an endless series of devastating hallucinations. That would have been too much for my achy heart that doesn't handle horror all that good. So I'm glad that the creators choose a more empirical enemy. For horror fans: highly recommended........ - 4/5 .......",7,0,1,21 June 2006
Inside Man," A solid cast (un)rolls a complex 'joint'.
","I must shamefully admit that this is the second movie from 2006 besides V for Vendetta that I've had the chance to see. Not much I know, but is it just me or has 2006 so far been the crappiest year for film since... who knows. Anyway this is my second Spike Lee's 'joint' besides 25th Hour and I must say it's pretty striking.Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer all played their characters fluently without having any problems but Clive Owen is the one that had some minor greatness attached to him after all. His intro was awesome and I consider it to be one the film's best moments.Since all of the action evolves around the bank robbery, we are pretty sure that the only motive for doing it is money. And if we wouldn't have been questioned about the 'why' in the beginning it would have seemed even weirder as it did. No I won't give away the plot, I'll just say that I'm glad I knew very little about it. The last half an hour turned the movie upside-down three times for me.It's not without it's problems though. The problem is the films pace and narrative which are pretty 'genrey' in the first hour, but I feel that a lot could have been made better. The tension could have been screwed up tighter but you feel as if a lot is saved for the last half an hour. And yes a lot of (side) characters could have been developed a bit better. Yup, the hostage situation was definitely robbed of it's tension because of the last part. And because the robbers were too nice.Although this is a 'medium' budget Hollywood flick and by no chance an independent one, as I've said, you will be surprised. At least from that point of view. I know I was and I regret I didn't see it in a theater just because I couldn't hear the audience say 'WTF(?), roll it back please'. So yes paying strict attention is required. Otherwise see it again like I did........ - 4/5 .......",7,2,3,30 June 2006
Pulp Fiction," Thank god Mr. T saved the best for last.
","OK, where to begin? First, why did it take soooo long to see this movie? I have no idea, I guess I see to many of the latest flicks and don't pay a lot of attention to stuff that's more than 5 years old. The other reason must be that this flick is less on TV than Forrest Gump for instance. I've seen Gump ages ago, but Pulp just dodged and dodged my proximity. Who knows, maybe I was afraid of the disappointment of seeing 'the best of the best' and then begin to wonder what's left? Now I'm not wondering what's left, just why was the movie that different from my expectations? I just expected something... bigger. A bigger, more important plot. I won't get into the details, but it evolves around a group of small criminals, who's lives change because of a few incidents. Nothing really that big. If we get to certain characters, like Uma Thurman for instance, it's a pretty insignificant character. The same I felt for Harvery Keitel. Now really for a film on this level you don't expect your characters to go dry. But the fact is that some of the actors didn't do that much for the film at all. Just the opposite of what you've heard from your friends (or suspected from the film poster). An hour and a half or more into the movie I started to wonder if this is it? People consider this to be the single best crime/thriller of the 90's and so far it hasn't been all that. As it's already well known, Tarantino likes to make his films feel nonlinear. But still, we get the best for last, ending up exactly where we stared. My favorite part of the film. The best laughs and thrills were in my opinion from those scenes. Someone once wrote: 'We don't judge films on what they are, but how they are about it'. And that's the thing with Pulp Fiction. I mean there are hundreds of films with drugs involved, gun shooting, gangsters, all sorts of violence and just what in the world makes this one so significant? And a famous saying goes: 'The devil is in the details' and so is Pulp. And all I can say is: Just freakin' see it already!......... -5/5 .........",9,0,1,24 July 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Sadly just another hamburger
","There is absolutely nothing besides Brad kicking Angie's ass that you could not expect from this movie. The definition of a Hollywood high-budget hamburger comes very close with this movie. Ever since the first 'love' scene which looked more like a Bacardi commercial I knew I was about to see an hour and a half of classic Hollywood ham.When the movie was over I wasn't far off. My friends that watched the movie with me were all in a very indifferent mood. Their 'no big deal' expression was pretty obvious. OK now let's get to the point where I actually say what's good and what's bad about the movie. Let's start with what I didn't like. The director didn't take two seconds for the pure shock of finding out that ones spouse is a hit-man. It was like 'he's a hit-man, I'm gonna kill him now'. A few scenes were very far-fetched (the rope scene for instance). Not once I didn't feel that I was pulled in the action. The movie really is a two-hour MTV video. And the good stuff? Well, the action scenes were not that bad at times but what else can you expect from a 110 million $ budget? I think the movie get's slightly better over the last 45 minutes. It finds it's pace in the cooperation of the two leads. But when Brad and Angie want to kill each other it just looks far-fetched...... +2/5 .....",5,0,1,16 September 2005

","I heard this film is allegedly a remake of a Hong Kong film called Mou gaan dou, which I sadly haven't seen before this one. That fact takes off a lot of the originality that The Departed would have poses if it hadn't been a remake. So I'll try to take that in consideration. But since it's a Scorsese flick I spent a little more time comparing it to his (still) better crime-drama, Goodfellas. In my opinion, just because of the pure chronology, considering that Goodfellas was made about sixteen years before The Departed, that alone makes it a more original piece of the crime world.Let's face it. The crime genre is by now a pretty well investigated universe. I'm not thinking just about films, but tens of TV series as well. So in sense of originality, The Departed does come a little short. However, the cast, the performances and the entire realization of the project are quite a different story.These are probably DiCaprio's and Damon's toughest roles yet. I've read one review of the film in the papers so far, and the critic described them as 'eternal boys', that just couldn't fully pull it off. But I think he was wrong, because the film doesn't rely that much on their brutality. Instead we really get a view into an intense struggle on two opposite fronts. I think most of the beauty of the film lies within Costigan's and Sullivan's insecurity and unawareness of who's who in this game. It kind of feels like good old fashioned voyeurism, since we are the ones that see it all from a bird's-eye view. And along with the story, the characters just get more and more corrupt.I would say that this one does deserve a good spot on the chart of best crime films in recent years. The only problem I see in it is that it doesn't appear to be that quite fresh. Like I've said the crime genre is already very well worked and tested. But if you take all the attributes into account I think it's very worthy to spend two and a half hours of time on it......... +4/5 ........",8,0,0,7 November 2006
Ice Age," Great fun. Presumably the funniest animated film I've seen so far.
","Ice Age is a movie that really focuses on it's characters. I found the way the characters look, move and sound very funny and amazing. It wouldn't be fair to say that they just had some life in them like I did for Madagascar. At times I was so sunk in that I forgot that I was watching invented creatures because they appeared so authentic.I won't give away the story, all I can say is that it's pretty classical but still very worth watching and portraying on the big screen. There's also a pile of fun and imaginative creatures in the movie. But most of all the creators gave great significance to fun and adventure.Surprisingly there's just a handful of movie references which I didn't mind at all. One of the few things I didn't find very good was the action that went a bit overboard at times. Overall this is a very fun animated feature. I'm still quite new in seeing these sort of movies but this one was perhaps the best I've seen so far......... 4/5 ........",8,0,0,20 September 2005
Inception," The astounding art of MANIPULATION
","I think I finally came around this movie after months. My first review was sloppy and superficial. I've seen it months ago and since then I haven't give it much of a thought. But now it hit me from nowhere, I finally see what the essence of this piece of art is- it's about the art of manipulation.There are only a handful of movies, every now and then a new one is made, for which it can be truly said that it represents some kind of a 'document' or at least an amazing meditation of how we already live today and how we will live in the near future. In this regard I would put Inception right next to the Matrix. The later is in essence a film about a completely ignorant super-used workforce of humans, who haven't actually moved from their wombs yet, but at the same time they have computer generated illusions about how they reached 'the peak of civilization'. This kind of humanity is completely immature (but not pure, or innocent) until a New man comes from somewhere and decides to move from this cave of ignorance and unconscious slavery. Most of them stay there, some by their own free will, because it's pleasant.Now the key thing about this movie, is not just that it's a long 'journey into the mind', but what matters is what comes out. It takes inception to make perception. That's the whole trick. The conciseness is a product and the subject of manipulation doesn't know a bit about it. He wrongfully thinks that his consciousness 'mirrors' the world 'as it is', but it doesn't, it never did and it never will.Inception is a pure and plastic example of how we live in the 21. century. We live in a world where there is an infinite amount of media inception of ideas on a daily level. All of it is very well planned and targeted, nothing spontaneous about it. And yet we still egoistically think how our minds 'mirror' the world as it is and how independent we are. We cannot except or even know that our minds are a product, that our perceptions are a product. To realize that, one would at least need to 'plug off' for a substantial amount of time from this. But that is costly, so nobody does it. In the end our own defense mechanism screw us up, because we refuse to recognize what kind of fools we are.",10,2,14,16 April 2011
Munich," This is one gruesome and haunting political thriller.
","Munich follows the story of the 1972 assassination at the Olympic games in Munich, Germany. A group of 11 Israeli athletes was kidnapped and murdered by a group of Palestinians, known as Black September. The Israeli intelligence agency Mossad was determined to find and eliminate the people who executed the attack Therefore Mossad sent five men who were all trained professionals for specific fields, erased their entire data and provided them with large funds. Their mission was to find the members of Black September on the territory of Western Europe and eliminate them one by one.The film is specifically marked by Spielberg's precise handling and direction. Using long shots, slow zooms and other techniques he intentionally made it look like it was made in the 1970's. The set-design really deepens the sense of being there at that time and place in Europe. As we follow the group of five men, they shortly tracked down and murdered the first one of their targets. Every time they search for someone they move to a new location. They're paying large amounts of money to a source named Louie who provides them with precise info about the identities and whereabouts of their targets. But despite the incredible accuracy of their source, certain members of the group are becoming more and more paranoid and start to doubt about the justification of their mission. Particularly the group's leader, Avner. His head is becoming fuller with horrible images and even fictions about what really happened to the Israeli hostages on that faithful day.There are at least three parts of the film I would like to stress out. First is the incredible throat-grabbing paranoia that is rising within the group. The danger of their work becomes evident when it's clear that their as much of an easy target as their victims are. The second stress would be about the gruesome and uncompromising graphic depiction of violence. It made me feel repulsive but simultaneously related to the guilt in Avner's head. The third thing that deserves a point out is the performing of all the characters which stays sober and never goes off the tracks to the very end. One thing is also interesting, it's how Avner is unable to recognize himself with the consequences of the mission. Facts just don't matter to him, rationalizing doesn't do him any good. He simply finds no legitimate reason for what he's done. To me this makes Munich a more or less unbiased statement about the events that it described. Besides Brokeback Mountain this is easily the most touching, haunting and quality film I've seen to come out of 2005 (so far)......... +4/5 ........",8,0,0,16 April 2006
Cinderella Man," Corny and too politically correct but it's impossible to say that it is below average.
","It's evident that the entire cast tried very hard on virtually every notable part of the film. The story is about an off-written boxer Jim Braddock who's glory days seem to have gone away. It's the time of the early 1930's, a couple of years after the stock exchange market had collapsed. Time of the 'Great Depression' they say. In the middle of it there's Jim Braddock, trying to support his family with manual work like most men back in those days. He stopped boxing because of a few bad injuries but the circumstances become so unbearable that he is determined to start his old profession again. Just for a fight or two he says. To get 'back in the black'.The 1930's atmosphere is pretty authentic I just don't know why I find boxing films that occur in the present time more convincing. I guess I just relate to them strongly. Million Dollar Baby had the 'underdog effect' that exceeded this one. In my point of view MDB is a superior film on every aspect that it's possible too compare the two. Both movies have very handy color usage which contribute to the morbid atmosphere. That's a bit more visible in Cinderella man where the gray and brown shades are used through the entire story. As politically correct as it is, it evolves in a pretty linear tempo. The tension rises when Braddock is notified that he's about to fight a little less politically correct opponent. Now we have a classical 'god vs. evil' tale. My favorite part of the film: When Braddock is watching the copy of what Max Baer (his rival) has done in his previous fight. It amplified the tension and drove the story through a little curve. A few words on some fundamental aspects of (non-animated) movies. The acting is this movie's trump card. I can hardly believe that Crowe didn't receive an Oscar nom. Giammati's character was not all that. He seemed too usual. Zellweger was OK and pretty decent in playing Braddock's wife. At least a GG nom would have been something to expect for her acting. I wouldn't exactly place this in the top 250 list, probably somewhere in the tail of top 300. Besides I really juggled with a 7 and an 8......... 4/5 ........",8,0,1,26 March 2006
The Godfather," Truly one of the best movies I've ever seen
","Well what's there to say that hasn't already been said about this exceptional film. It takes us into the backstage of organized crime and shows us it's nature in evident detail. I won't be writing about the plot since it's pretty clear to everyone. I'll just write a few lines on the parts of the film I found excellent and very memorable.One of the best little details was the piano tune which kept playing at every tense moment. If you watch the movie for the first time it can fill you up with quite a lot of anxiety (second or third viewing still can't exclude it). The final act was exceedingly memorable and symbolic. We see Michael Corleone and his family at the church during a sacred act, the christening of his niece. Parallel to that event is the killing of the family rivals. This act gives a statement that there is nothing sacred in the world of organized crime. Every promise is broken for the benefit of the family business.It's very hard to find an objective flaw in this film. I'll just have to say 'it's not business, it's strictly personal' :)So let it be: The very FIRST movie ever to officially receive a 10/10 from me. .......... +5/5 ..........",10,0,2,25 November 2005
