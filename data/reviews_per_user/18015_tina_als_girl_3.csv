Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Best Movie of the 20th Century!
","You know, I have heard so many positive comments about the special effects in 'The Matrix', but I must say something: They are NOTHING compared to the wonderful effects in TPM! No, I have not seen Matrix, but all I have to do is watch the previews to know how the effects are. I'm always telling my friends, ''The Matrix' is totally different from 'TPM'. They used the movie to show off their special effects. However, George used the special effects to show off his story.'And what a story it is! My friend complained about it being simply a 'history lesson'. But I think it was the best of all the Star Wars movies so far! Amidala was my favorite character. I had just turned 14 days before the release of TPM. And in the movie, Amidala was 14. It was really cool seeing a girl my age ruling an entire planet!And Jar Jar WAS NOT annoying! He was really cool! In fact, without him, it wouldn't have been Star Wars! Just compare the band of main characters in TPM to A New Hope: There were the two Jedi, a hotshot pilot, a young girl of royal blood, the two droids, and the tall, lanky, bumbling alien! Without Jar Jar, the group wouldn't have been complete! And our two Jedi would never have made it to Theed City, and the Trade Federation Army would have won!",8,5,7,11 July 2000
Men in Black II," Color Me Weird (spoilers)
","Okay, I'm going to say what I thought about the movie, although it seems to me as though I'm one of a very small handful who feels this particular way.I loved it. I simply loved it. It was funny and enjoyable. Will Smith did a wonderful job of looking lonely. You could really feel how much he truly missed Agent K. I loved how we found out that he had been neuralizing all his partners. Sure, it's very cliche plot-wise, but *I* thought it was interesting.I think the person who did the best job in this film was Tommy Lee Jones. He was wonderful throughout the whole film: his confusion and skepticism when Agent J tries to bring him back to NYC; his amused naivety when watching Agent J talk to the alien who had the makeshift deneuralizer; his sorrowful, tear-filled expression when remembering the true story of the Ambassador he had fallen in love with. That scene in particular had me *so* close to crying myself. Tommy pulled it off so well, it really tugged at my heart-strings...Frank the Pug was my favorite alien. I loved his rendition of 'I Will Survive' and the hilarious 'Who Let the Dogs Out?' scene.Anyway, basically, I absolutely loved this film, and having not seen the first movie since it first premiered, MIB II was completely new to me.Here's hoping there's an MIB III!!!",Null,0,0,14 July 2002
Shrek," What can I say? ((Possible SPOILERS))
","Everyone else has pretty much said everything for me.I gave 'Shrek' a 10 outta 10 because, well, there was no option for any rating higher than 10!!!I originally wanted to see the movie merely because of the graphics (as I am an aspiring computer graphics artist)... but after seeing the trailers/previews, I became interested in seeing it for more than just the graphics.Boy, am I ever glad I did! I'm a fan of Disney movies, but as others have said, Disney obviously follows a set pattern for their fairy tale movies, and it gets old after a while.Well, 'Shrek' is not from Disney, and that's probably one of the reasons I liked it! For me, the ending was totally unexpected, because I guess I was expecting a Disney fairytale-type ending, when the 'beast' (Shrek, in this instance) becomes a dashing prince...My favorite character was Fiona. When her character first shows up, she seems to be like your typical fairytale princess. But she turns out to be a belching, kick-butt, warrior princess with an attitude and a mysterious secret.And then there's Donkey. What a hoot! Other people complained about his incessant chatter, but I think that's one element that made him so funny! I was a little disappointed that Murphy slipped in a 'd*mn' in there as he and Shrek set off on their quest through the sunflower field, but other than that, I loved Donkey! 'And in the morning, I'm making waffles!'The graphics were, well, totally indescribable!!! Sure, I've seen pics from 'Final Fantasy,' and I have to agree that they seem to have just a bit more realism in them, but that doesn't really count.I watched a behind-the-scenes show dealing with 'Shrek,' and they revealed that when they did Fiona, she looked *so* real that they had to *pull back* on the technology for her so she would fit in with the rest of the characters. This means, they probably had her looking so real she woulda fit right in with the 'Final Fantasy' characters.As for these people who have dissed 'Shrek,' all I can do is remind you that 'Shrek' was an official competitor in the Cannes Film Festival, and is the first animated film in 50 years to be so. Plus, it got a standing ovation after its showing... that means a standing ovation from some of the best in Hollywood... You can't beat that!!!",8,0,0,22 May 2001
