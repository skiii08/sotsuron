First Man," A mostly stellar biopic.
","I once hear a person say they would love to visit Australia, except that everything there could kill them. The same could be said for outer space. The only difference is Australia was meant as a joke.This danger of space flight-and the fact that we, the audience, feel it so clearly-is just part of what makes First Man one of the best movies of 2018. Similar to The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 in content, but closer to Interstellar in tone and pacing, the film is a winning synthesis of top-notch acting and bold, skillful direction. In its weak points it echoes another Christopher Nolan film, Dunkirk, perhaps slowing its tempo and extending its silence a little too much. But like that film, these shortcomings make it different, and thus, memorable. Which, these days, is its own triumph.Most of you know the story; many of you lived it. 1961 brings our first glimpse of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), testing a NASA plane as it climbs through the Earth's atmosphere into the lower reaches of space. Years pass. Friends are made, then-too often-lost at the hands of a crash or other malfunction.First Man features three main flight sequences, and two of them are absolute nailbiters. The movie puts us at the visceral center of an era in which a handful of men volunteered to harness limited technology and primitive design to reach beyond the world they knew. They pushed the envelope of existence. We sense their fear, experience their heartbreak, and are left to wonder why they continue after enduring such sacrifice. But then, maybe we know the reasons.Armstrong continues his rise through NASA as the decade progresses. The Gemini missions come and go, paving the way for Apollo. Soon the day nears when he'll begin a journey, and take a step, that no man ever has before. First Man accomplishes what every familiar, true story sets out to do: reveal to people the details they don't know and bring to life the headlines they do.It all begins with simulating reality. To this end, director Damian Chazelle goes a step further than most by draping every shot in a grainy, time-period texture. From the Armstrongs' clapboard house to the sterilized halls of NASA, First Man is a movie about the 1960's that looks like it was filmed in the 1960's. This approach is effective and, next to the flash and gloss of most of today's releases, simply refreshing.Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land), 33, has been called a wunderkind, and rightly so. But the label isn't so much due to his striking visuals or strong characters as it is his ability to make the audience feel. This is the hardest thing to do in movies. The right budget can buy brilliant special effects and pristine sound quality, but neither requires more than a surface response from those in the front row. How do you get them to care?It helps to have an able cast. Gosling starred in La La Land, and it's fair to question whether inviting him back for First Man was more about comfort than quality. But it's difficult to imagine anyone else bringing more authenticity to the role. He imbues Armstrong with bravery, fear, anger, generosity-all the shades of a real human being. As his wife Janet, Clair Foy is equally strong in an equally meaty role. Their relationship is the beating heart of the film and just as compelling as every flight into space.Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler and Cory Stoll lead a supporting crew so packed with talent that players like Shea Whigham, Ethan Embry and Brian d'Arcy James get mere seconds of screen time. Justin Hurwitz fills some of the void with a score that's separate parts tension, inspiration and emotion, but altogether original.First Man spends just as much time on Earth as it does in space. It never forgets that any ship, no matter how fast, still needs a pilot. For all the miles it covers, the movie is a human story. That may well be its greatest achievement.",9,2,6,18 October 2018
Ready Player One," Lacks the magic of Spielberg's past blockbusters.
","'I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.' Those words come courtesy of Bilbo (Ian Holm) in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. But they also illustrate perfectly why Ready Player One, while fun in parts and an overall success, doesn't quite capture the magic of its director's past blockbusters.That director is Stephen Spielberg, an ideal choice to spearhead a film celebrating every dimension and detail of late-twentieth-century pop culture. Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Back to the Future, Jurassic Park-these are just a few of the properties he has brought to the big screen. If each of them could look in from the past to see this newest creation, what would they say? One thing is undeniable: Ready Player One, whether the movie or Ernest Cline's bestselling novel on which it is based, stands as one of the most original entertainment entities of the new millennium. Its story occurs in the year 2045, with society having taken a less-than-utopian turn. Consequently, nearly everyone spends their time plugged into a virtual world known as the OASIS. Money, friends, fame, love-anything worth experiencing happens in there. Reality is for losers.Especially considering that the game's original designer, James Halliday (a brilliant Mark Rylance), planted a special egg deep within its digital walls. The first 'player' to find the egg gets half a trillion dollars and total control of the OASIS (which, essentially, amounts to world domination). The catch? The path to the egg consists exclusively of contests, quizzes and other tricky breadcrumbs based on Halliday's love for 80's movies, music and video games. Know the founder and you'll find the finish line.This is exactly what teenager Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) intends to do. Thanks to his obsessive knowledge of Halliday, he (and thus, his OASIS avatar Parzival) have a great chance to succeed. He's also got a best friend (Aech), a new girl (Art3mis) and an arch nemesis (Nolan Sorrento, head of IOI, the sinister real-world corporation that also wants control of the OASIS).This is the short version, and still a lot to unpack. I don't want to be 'that guy,' but I did read the book before I saw the movie. For anyone else in the same boat, it should be noted that the movie departs from its source material on several fronts.Many adjustments are necessary and simply based on the medium. An early scene from the book involving a video game competition becomes a massive, exhilarating car race in the movie. The latter, of course, is much more suited to a visual experience, and the production's willingness to adapt should be applauded. Nor are the changes pure sacrilege, as Cline co-wrote the script. Each alteration echoes the author.But it also takes us back to Bilbo. For it's not just that a novel contains so much more information than a movie; it's that this particular novel is all about the information, the details. Ready Player One has characters, and a story, but cares more than anything about minutiae-the tidbits of cultural knowledge that only geeks and fanboys would know.The movie's intentions to highlight this are valiant, but misguided. Yes, we see the Iron Giant battle Mechagodzilla; we feel the eeriness of the Overlook Hotel; we hear the retro beats of Jump and We're Not Gonna Take It. But we don't fully experience any of them. There are just too many. The movie spends all its time simply reaching these coveted niches, there's none left to actually enjoy the visit.That doesn't mean, of course, that the journey can't be fun. For starters, Ready Player One might feature the most impressive use of CGI since Avatar. This is a movie that literally could not have been made twenty years ago. The story itself is well-paced, with likeable characters speeding through a fresh world of surprise and discovery.If you view the film as a series of nostalgic moments-Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Atari, The Millennium Falcon-it's hard to be disappointed. But if you're looking for those moments to add up to something-to become more than the sum of vintage parts-then you may have to resort to reading.There's a scene near the end of the film between two characters in a bedroom. It's simple, quiet; it breathes, it takes its time. Through the silence, and a touch of wonder, it leads us to emotion. Almost without knowing it, we feel like a kid again.I think this is the movie Spielberg really wanted to make. Sometimes the flash and bang and noise detract from the real entertainment. Here, it's the wonder of new worlds, and new friends. More than anything, that is the soul of Ready Player One.",6,0,2,4 April 2018
Black Panther," Nothing New
","As a movie critic, my chief responsibility is to tell you whether a given release is worth your time and money. While this can often be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no,' a longer explanation is typically necessary. Not so here. Black Panther, for all its positive buzz and fresh casting, is a Marvel movie: if you've enjoyed their past films, you'll probably enjoy this one; if not, you'll be just like me.Which, if you've read my past reviews, may come as no surprise. But this time was supposed to be different. Beyond achieving Marvel Studios' highest Rotten Tomatoes score ever (97%), Black Panther garnered one of the highest-grossing opening weekends, and now second weekends, of all time. Surely such unprecedented success was the result of a fresh, inspired product.On paper the story, though perhaps overstuffed, holds plenty of promise: the kingdom of Wakanda, in the heart of Africa, is seen by most of the world as just another impoverished nation. But in reality, thanks to a rare, all-powerful compound known as vibranium, it is the planet's most advanced civilization. Wakanda's clean streets and futuristic technology are hidden within its earthly dust like an alternate universe.
The king, by right of birth and physical combat, wears not a crown but the suit and special abilities of a warrior-a Black Panther. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) has just inherited this duty. He has strong support and a good heart, but must contend with a newfound challenge rising from the past actions of his father.There is much more, but the tragedy is that it hardly matters. Why should an audience parse the depths of narrative details-how can it-when the film itself seems incapable of breaking the surface?This, mind you, is not the fault of the stellar cast or offscreen talent. It is the result of a homogenization of creativity, as if, before beginning a new Marvel project, each participant must sign a Disney contract sacrificing their individual vision and style for the good of the prevailing formula.An example: most of the Mission: Impossible films are surface deep as well, but at least we can readily identify their directors through the look and feel of each entry. From Iron Man through Black Panther, eighteen Marvel movies have employed the diverse talents of Jon Favreau, James Gunn, Shane Black and Kenneth Branagh (among others) behind the camera; good luck guessing which director belongs to which film. Now, this could all just be me. It's clear the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was meant, before anything else, to simply be fun. But how long can fun last when every outing feels the same? When there are no stakes because there's no chance the hero will die before the next sequel is made?I say all this because I've always loved blockbusters-Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Independence Day, The Lord of the Rings. The best ones all have their own unique magic. But whenever I watch a Marvel movie I feel that magic slipping away. Depth, subtlety and intelligence have never been hallmarks of the blockbuster, but when did we stop even reaching for them?If it feels that I've neglected Black Panther specifically in this review, know that each word applies to it. And that's the problem. Despite a wealth of rich characters and conflict, the film has little identity outside of the Marvel brand.It's similar to the time producer Kevin Feige, chief architect of the MCU, discussed genres within the franchise. He labeled Captain America: The Winter Soldier a political thriller, and he was right. But compared to every other political thriller, it was just another Marvel movie.",5,5,8,28 February 2018
The Greatest Showman," The Best Musical Soundtrack in Decades.
","What makes a musical a great movie? If it's story and character development-bringing you closer to every emotional twist and turn, energizing the empty space between each song-The Greatest Showman is a mediocre enterprise. If, however, it's music that makes a musical, then Showman is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best musicals in decades.The movie is essentially a biography of P.T. Barnum, whose name is synonymous with the circus he founded. It's 19th century New York. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) grows up a tailor's son, then a street rat. He marries the wealthy Charity and they have two beautiful daughters.Years later they're still in New York, barely getting by. Charity's happily left her silver spoon behind, but Barnum wants more for her, their daughters, and himself-even if he doesn't know it.His imagination and drive lead to a museum, which becomes a freak show, then is renamed a 'circus.' But, perhaps, not even Phineas Taylor Barnum could have foreseen the heights his creation would eventually reach.It's not a rare narrative arc; you've seen this story before: goodhearted businessman breaks his foot getting it in the door, finally earns his fortune, then risks everything to remember what life is really all about. And, while Showman is inspired by true events, no cynic would be chided for narrowing an eye toward such benevolent treatment of a character many consider a swindler and a fraud.None of this, though, is likely to matter by the time the end credits role. Because the music-the songs, the dancing-are just that good. From The Other Side, sung by Barnum and his new partner Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron), to Carlyle and Anne Wheeler (Zendaya) soaring through Rewrite the Stars, to Lettie Lutz's (Keala Settle) show stopping This is Me, every tune is a prime cut. Never Enough, The Greatest Show, A Million Dreams-trust me, the titles don't do them justice.But a soundtrack is one thing...and one thing only; it's half a movie. You need visuals to bring the lyrics to life. Enter Jackman, who, with his effervescence and likeability, seems born to play Barnum. Efron reminds us of the musical chops that made him a star in the first place; Williams and Zendaya each shine in the vocal spotlight, the former surprising us with her talent, the latter not at all.This might be why The Greatest Showman is, in parts, an acute disappointment. There is such opportunity for more here, beyond song and stage. But from the start the film adopts a streamlined, almost frantic storytelling. Details are glossed over; years of activity are condensed within the melody of a montage.This style doesn't necessarily have to backfire, but Showman lacks the patience to make it work. The movie is like a rock on a lake, skipping over its dramatic possibilities, never quite breaking their surface. It also carries hints of the metaphysical, sometimes seeming more dreamlike than real. This can enchant, but also isolate, keeping an audience at arm's length from a world and characters struggling to attain true flesh and blood. And yet...the music. It all comes back to that. This is, after all, a musical. Upon further review, relating the story may not be such a lost cause. For we don't always need to know a character through what they say and do, but by how they sing and dance. Lyrics-the right lyrics, sung in the right way-have the power to reveal a human heart in greater detail than the grandest soliloquy or deepest history ever could.That is what The Greatest Showman does. We know these characters, this world, through their song. Perhaps that is what a musical was always meant to be.",8,0,2,1 January 2018
Green Book," Real Good - Feel Good
","Most would never mistake Hollywood marketing executives for softies, but this time they could have fooled us. How else to explain why Universal knew to release Green Book around Thanksgiving, a time of celebrating family and friendship. For, while the movie's true story may not be profound enough to change your life, it certainly altered its characters for the rest of theirs. Watching such endearing kinship play out on screen is enough to melt the heart of even the staunchest scrooge.New York, 1962. A bouncer at the Copacabana nightclub named Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), aka Tony Lip, is temporary laid off after the building suffers fire damage. Seeking work to support his wife (Linda Cardellini) and two sons, he is referred to Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a virtuoso pianist who needs a driver to ferry him on a concert tour through the Deep South. But Dr. Shirley is black. His companion can't just camp out behind the wheel; he has to be able to make problems...go away.Tony, as it happens, is quite good at this. So after some haggling over price, the two embark on a two-month journey from Macon to Memphis, Birmingham to Baton Rouge. The bigotry and violence they find along the way are no surprise; the fact that their relationship almost makes us forget about such hardship is another story.Peter Farrelly directed this movie. Yes, the same Farrelly brother behind such comedies as Dumb and Dumber and Shallow Hall. Green Book is obviously a different bird. But while Farrelly does impress with his handling of the dramatic material, it's the humor that sets this film apart from so many others of its ilk.Race is a tense, heavy subject. We need to be able to laugh, not just at characters on a screen but, perhaps, at ourselves. In comedy, like a universal smile, we find common ground.
Which is a perfect Segway to Tony Lip. I have to believe Mortensen had a ball
playing this character. Vallelonga is a pasta-munching Italian from Brooklyn who isn't just a presence, he's a force. Tony is the truth behind the stereotype. And despite a rough exterior, he loves his family-which, of course, includes aunts, uncles, cousins and the old couple who run the pawn shop down the street. There's more than one shade of Moonstruck lighting these tenement floors.All this describes the character, but that's the heart of Mortensen's performance. He disappears into Tony, making him cringeworthy and loveable all at once.Then there's Doc Shirley-talented, educated, single. Essentially the antithesis of Tony, which is the surface conceit of most 'road' movies. 'They couldn't have been more different...' But, like the better entries of its genre-Midnight Run, Trains, Planes and Automobiles-Green Book finds the humanity in its headliners. Are Tony and Don really that different? And if so, why not celebrate such variety?Ali, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2016's Moonlight, makes the difficult seem effortless in peeling back the doctor's layers. Shirley is a complex character-austere yet vulnerable, lonely and proud-but by the end of the movie, we know him. We love him.When it comes to overall quality, Green Book is a unique case; there's nothing specifically 'wrong' with it. That's not, though, the same as saying it's perfect. I've seen more emotional and inspiring movies, and even deeper characters. But the film is still a triumph, a 'real good feel good' experience that's hard to forget.The biggest reason for this is because of how it addresses its racial subject matter. There is no pointing of fingers. The movie pulls no punches when recounting instances of discrimination, but that's not its focus. Instead, the spotlight shines on two men accepting one another as fallen, beautiful human beings.",8,1,3,22 November 2018
Jurassic Park," One of the best blockbusters ever.
","There's a line in a trailer for the upcoming sequel Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in which Chris Pratt's Owen Grady asks, 'do you remember the first time you saw a dinosaur?'I do.It was twenty-five years ago, back in 1993, when I watched the original Jurassic Park in theaters for the first time. I was nine years old, and the dinosaurs seemed so real. It wasn't so much the CGI, though that was state-of-the-art and holds up shockingly well. It was the wonder of seeing something for the first time, the spectacle and power of prehistoric life on the big screen.With that in mind, and the imminent arrival of said sequel, it felt more than appropriate to revisit Jurassic Park as it celebrates its silver jubilee.The movie was such a landmark, its easy to forget it was based on an equally successful book by Michael Crichton. The relatively simple story didn't change much from page to screen. You all know it anyway:Idealistic promoter recreates hundreds of dinosaurs with preserved mosquito blood; group of scientists travels to exotic island for sneak peak at theme park of the resurrected beasts; things go terribly wrong; those visitors that don't get eaten spend the remaining time running and screaming.It's funny-based on this description, the movie sounds like a disposable piece of horror schlock. Nothing could be further from the truth. But how?Let's start with the most obvious reason-it was directed by Steven Spielberg. And this at a time when he was in his prime, the king of Hollywood. He'd already made Jaws and E.T., and still had future hits like Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln to come. But while he delivered with expected, well-rounded expertise, there's one aspect of Spielberg's approach that's worth highlighting above all others.It stems from the fact that Jurassic Park the novel is darker and more violent than the movie. In fact, James Cameron (The Terminator, Aliens) nearly nabbed the rights to direct the film instead. By his own admission, his version would've been more intense and graphic-closer to the source material, and almost certainly rated R.That would've been interesting, but hardly suitable for most nine-year-olds. That's where Spielberg comes in. As with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and War of the Worlds, he possesses the special ability to create tension for all ages. Whether a child or adult, when you watch his movies your pulse is racing, nerves consistently brought to the brink but never over the edge. You leave the theater not afraid, but exhilarated, a smile of sheer energy spread across your face.But he doesn't do it alone. There are so many other reasons why, a quarter-century later, Jurassic Park still feels new. Take John Williams' legendary score, which nearly upstaged the dinosaurs themselves and remains popular today. Or the way David Koepp's underrated script peppers in saving doses of humor ('I'm always on the lookout for the next ex-Mrs. Malcolm').Who were Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum before this movie? Certainly not household names. They were never really movie stars, either. Instead, they were-and are-skilled actors that lend Jurassic Park an envious on-screen pedigree among summer blockbusters. And despite many modern complaints of 'annoying' child stars, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello have consistently avoided such a label. The credit is theirs, displaying a genuine combination of fascination and fear, making them simply what every actor hopes to be-part of the movie.Like Star Wars, Terminator 2 and Toy Story, Jurassic Park broke technological ground. But also like those movies, it connected with its audience beyond mere scale and pixels. This is why, twenty-five years later, we keep coming back to the original. And why its next twenty-five will roar just as loudly.",10,2,2,21 June 2018
