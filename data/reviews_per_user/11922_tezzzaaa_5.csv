Requiem for a Dream," mind blowing film, speeding towards a powerfully horrible climax
","When the film started I was quite easily overtaken by it,  the melodic music by the Kronos Quartet backed up by a trip hop kinda beat effectively adding to this.  I loved the way the camera and lightning backed up the mood of the moment, or rather the season, as the film is divided in the four seasons. These set the mood and atmospheres accordingly. This is especially clear (would be the right word to use here!) in the Spring and Summer.  The lights outside are blinding, so blinding this should either be considered as surreal or as being an omen, if you will, of the things to come.  Don't be tempted by the brightness! The film deals with four personalities and the ways they get dragged in a world of addiction.  In case of the three young people it's dope, in case of the mother, beautifully and hauntingly acted, by drugs as well, but prescribed drugs, for her to loose weight, not less dangerous.  The fact that both these narcotics have been set as equally seductive and damaging was to me a great element of the film.  Films where drugs kill kids have been made plenty, we have been warned sufficiently I would say.  But placing kids and dope on the same line as people being on medication or, as in this film, diet pills(aka speed) adds a new and powerful dimension. At the same time this was the best part in the film for me.  The way this woman who so desperately wants to be young and beautiful again is pain steaking.  It also reminds a girl nowadays to try to not be dependent too much, either on beauty or on a husband that will provide for you, till he's dead (and you're not!).  The camera work here is excellent, as she becomes more and more paranoid, the camera moves with this, and makes things equally paranoid and shaky for the viewer. The path the kids go in the film starts off as being almost too perfect, to me anyway.  The film appeared as an Mtv video almost and seems to bring a message of 'dope is cool', with these hip kids shooting up while mixing records on their deks.  At first this kind of annoyed me, not cuz I believe drugs are all that bad and shouldn't be portrayed as giving satisfaction, but just cuz it seemed too easy to watch these perfectly sedated creatures. Then, when the mood of the film became more desperate and grim it seemed like the supposedly ideal state of the beginning was contrasting the rest perfectly.  Maybe this great beginning was only illustrating the dream and illusion the kids were living in, not only fooling the viewer, but also themselves.  On the other hand, things could have been close to perfect all the time, had they been more responsible. Exactly how the kids get drawn in a downward spiral so fast was not as convincing to me as the way the woman gets in deeper and deeper.  She is haunted by her memories of the past and idealizes her forgone beauty and the way she used to look in her red dress, how she could charm all those around her, the only way she thinks to achieve this again is to fit into that dress and appear on television.  She wants her moment of fame, tragically portraying the average American and the dominating role TV has taken in their lives. TV here seems almost like a metaphor for the misleading lures modern capitalist life has brought us, and that are slowly consuming us instead of us consuming them and growing. The film moves to a terrible climax, which was done very well and extremely effective.  Even those not easily shocked will not find it easy to stay unaffected, getting drawn in the misery and cruelty of the world to those who have lost control.  The scenes follow each other up in rapid speed, everything mixed in a whirlwind of  deceit, frustration, despair and inevitability.",Null,0,0,25 February 2001
Mulholland Drive," lynch makes a collage of his previous work
","Don't get me wrong, I am a great admirer of Lynch's work.  Not just his beautifully strange haunting films, but his painting and photography as well.  I have seen Lost Highway at least five times and it still intrigues me.  I think Eraserhead is one of the scariest cult horrors I have seen. The calming beauty of Straight Story couldn't have been captured by anyone else but Lynch.  The image of Bob from Twin Peaks can stil make me shiver thinking about it... but... Mulholland Drive didn't do those things for me.I think it is Lynch's most overrated work so far.  When these other films came out people were probably not ready for them yet.  When Mulholland Drive came out, I guess they were, so it was hauled by the press and audience as something they had never seen before.  And this is exactly where I think the film gets stuck!I almost feel bad giving this critical review, but I feel by doing this I am actually doing credit to the genius of Lynch's mind.  Although I'm not sure if the man himself would agree!  I think Lynch could do better. Let me start by saying that I did enjoy the film.  The atmosphere was still beautiful dreamy like.  It did miss the nightmarish dimension of Lost Highway though. Maybe cuz Betty, even when she turns darker, was so annoyingly nice and sweet.  There was a fair amount of your regular dry humor and some of the characters managed to give me the creeps for a moment, be it that they never had a deeper function.The plot itself soon lost my interest.  Maybe cuz I already knew the trick not to look for a binding thread too much.  You know with Lost Highway I still look for a missing piece of the puzzle, but in Mulholland Drive there are so many missing pieces you soon give up. Maybe it's not fair that I'm comparing this film to Lost Highway so much, but what can you expect when even the music, pretty decisive in creating the atmosphere, was identical at times. Then there was the dwarf we know from Twin Peaks.  Didn't Lynch have any new ideas of creating some other crazily disturbing characters?  As if he put them in for people unfamiliar with his work.  Or is Mulholland Drive an ode, a collage, to what he did before.  An ode out of the mind of some disturbed girl with a multiple personality syndrome?We know Lynch has a very typical way of handling the camera, which was one of the reasons to make a film with such a common story as The Straight Story still so beautiful and strange.  The camerawork of Mulholland Drive was too identical to Lost Highway though, but not as effective.  I didn't get any goosebumps.  I just felt dreamily entertained for two and a half hours.The love scenes between Rita and Betty were nice and seemed sincere.  Their relationship as a whole was convincing. That's were I liked the twist in the plot.  But then a lot of the rest seemed kind of useless entourage.  I don't know but Mulholland Drive really disappointed me coming out of this brilliant mind, I'm sorry to say...",6,2,4,12 July 2002
Donnie Darko," the eerie and sarcastic tone of the film stuck in my head for days
","This wonderful film is soothing and disturbing at the same time.  I guess it depends on who you identify with.  The strong catharsis the film is leading towards was the most comforting ending I've experienced in a film in a long time.  There may still be hope for all those who don't fit in and wonder if they are really the only sane ones among all those who are really just afraid of you.  When society says you are negative or weird when you know that you're the only one who can actually deal with the truth.  This is perfectly illustrated by the role of Patrick Swayze (comparable to the role of Tom Cruise in Magnolia)as the cleancut instuctor on living with fear, his oversimplified 'philosophy' of human emotion. No wonder he is metaphorized as the Anti Christ! I thought the film was filled with references to eighties teen films, ranging from Back to the Future to Carrie, but with a bitterly sarcastic undertone.  The sneering cynicism at all those values Americans claim to hold so high it rises above them, was excellent. To a European audience some issues raised, like banning Graham Greene's books, are probably ridiculous and out of the question in Europe.  To totally grasp some of these issues I guess you need good knowledge of American white middle-upperclass society. Overall the film is very original though at the same time it definitely fits in the line of the new genre of American films exposing the other, darker, if you will, side of supposedly ideal suburbian society, like American Beauty and Todd Solondz' films have done. Donnie Darko leaves you paralyzed and confused but it also made me feel wonderful.  The fantastic elements are beautiful and daring.  I was so sure that Donnie's hallucinations were real, that they were merely a higher step to the essence of being. It's a beautiful film in many ways, I didn't even mention the beautiful camerawork, adding to the dreamy atmosphere.  I'm glad to see some new talent has risen again!",9,0,0,22 June 2002

Princess Mononoke," Disney eat your heart out!
","Mononoke Hime is definitely the best fairytale cartoon I have ever seen. Not only is the animation outstanding, the story is beautiful too.  At last the viewer is treated with an intelligent cartoon, as so many are made and so few distributed, especially in Europe (shame on the film industry!).Miyazaki's style is wonderful.  I have enjoyed this film thoroughly three times.  It deals with the opposing forces of man vs. nature.  This fact gives the film an extra dimension.  Things aren't black and white as they are in mainstream American cartoons.Some scenes are pretty adult in the portrayal of violence (then again if your a Japanese kid, no harm done right?) and the philosophical layer the story contains.  At the same time it's plain fairy tale and warrior saga. Beautiful landscapes, amazing characters (don't you just love the little white silly forest spirits?) and exciting moments.  I can strongly recommend this film to many people.  Some are hesitant about watching cartoons, they expect Disney style animation and storyline.  This film is on a much higher level though.  It deals with an element of human nature which has taken the worst of us.  The essence of Mononoke Hime is the inevitability of human development, exploiting nature and taking the earth's destiny in our own hands.  Hereby we have killed the forests spirit, as indigenous people's everywhere are very aware of.  They are dying with it.Take these dimensions of the film as you will.  If you just want to enjoy a great piece of animation, without bothering to see the deeper meaning, be my guest and see this film too!",9,0,1,14 July 2002
