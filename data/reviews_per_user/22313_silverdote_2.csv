Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Genius
","There's not much else to say. As Manhola Dargis says in the NY Times, 'the 19th-century German thinker August Bebel observed, anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools, a truism Mr. Baron Cohen has embraced with a vengeance...' If you don't 'get it', then it's not for you---but for everyone else, this is perhaps the most brilliant satire and raging comedy of all time. It took me a little while to settle in to the film, mostly because I was already familiar with Borat from HBO and frankly, the trailers on TV and the Web give away much of the introduction. As the story picks up speed and frenzy, Borat's clueless charm, if you can call it that, takes on full form. I am reminded of the late-great Peter Sellers' own Inspector Clousseau. The bumbling idiocy has that kind of familiarity. Borat isn't out to hurt anyone---he just wants to discover America. And discover it, he does. Marching through the South, Borat comes across all manner of insular, racist citizens going about their daily lives. He leaves a trail of comedic tears as he lays waste to the unsuspecting victims. What a joy to be along for the ride. You'll wince, you'll flinch, you'll gasp for air. Great comedy like this doesn't come around often enough.",10,5,16,4 November 2006
The Irishman," Ponderous, derivative and a lie
","It's so bad. So very bad. Some of the worst, drawn out and lame scenes I can recall. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is, well, pretty pathetic. Proof that even good talent has a shelf life. Nothing to see here-it's the old gang sloooooowed way down to tell a story that's a lie. And Pacino...oy. So much yelling. Why must he yell? Other than the scenes with Frank Sheeran, it's not awful. Get it? Oh, and Hoffa dies.",3,2,8,28 December 2019
