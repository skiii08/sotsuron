The Avengers," Magical Marvel masterpiece.
","Marvel's The Avengers is an action packed must see cinematic masterpiece. Alan Silvestri's soundtrack was very heavenly. It made my parents and I really excited when we saw this at the theater. In my opinion, this is the BEST soundtrack and theme he's done so far.The story in this movie was amazing and was better than I expected. Joss Whedon and Zak Penn did a brilliant job of writing this movie. They should've gotten an Oscar nomination.The sound effects blew me away! The crashing, punching, and bombing sounds will make your jaw drop.The sets and locations looked so realistic, including the space scenes. It makes you feel like your in the movie.The way the Avengers worked together was thrilling because there were so many superheros with different powers that united and fought as one.To me, The Avengers was the best Marvel film of 2012.",10,2,6,13 March 2014
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes A Game Of Shadows was a great sequel!
","Sherlock Holmes A Game Of Shadows was a great sequel that had great slow motion scenes and awesome fight scenes.Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson did a very good job of saving the world from an evil professor named James Moriarty. Stephen Fry who played 'Mycroft Holmes' Sherlock's brother was funny character that talks very English and he was strange sometimes. I thought that Noomi Repace who played 'Madam Simza heron' did great job playing that character. And Jared Harris who played 'Professor James Moriarty' was just as smart as Sherlock Holmes. And I thought the last fight scene in this movie was interesting. Sherlock and Moriaty could think different attacks on each other, that scene was intense.The train scene was awesome,Sherlock disguised as a girl was funny. Also, the running scene in the forest was great.This movie was very thrilling!",8,2,3,15 March 2014
Star Trek," Star Trek rocks!
","Star Trek was a great movie. The way they began the the music was wonderful, the action scenes were amazing, the setting looked real, and the story was great.The original characters were really cool in this film. Leonard Nimoy played a great classic Spock and I thought Winona Ryder did a great job as his mother Amanda Grayson. Eric Bana who played 'Nero' is a great actor.This movie had plenty of action and fight scenes,and Nero's spaceship looked awesome.This was the best sci-fi movie of 2009.",9,1,2,31 January 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek Into Darkness was awesome!
","Star Trek Into Darkness was one of the greatest Star Trek movies ever made.The story was awesome,the soundtrack sounded heavenly, and the acting was great.The original characters were even better in this film. Benedict Cumberbatch who played 'Khan' was one of the best villains in the whole Star Trek franchise. I thought Admiral Alexander Marcus was Peter Weller's best role and I really liked Carol Marcus.I'm glad that she became a member of the crew.The action scenes were so thrilling with great fight scenes. The spaceships looked amazing and the way they traveled through space,in and out of warp, was incredible.This movie was great from start to finish!!!",10,14,24,25 January 2014
Alien," Alien marked the beginning of great sci-fi.
","1979 would mark the staple beginning for serious alien sci-fi movies. Its shocking realism, that was developed by special effects master Stan Winston, combined with director Ridley Scott, created something that will last forever. This movie took the basic plot of two earlier movies, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and It! The Terror From Beyond Space. However Alien succeeded in making you believe that it was real. Jerry Goldsmith could compose for space like no other. Hearing the score from the first note made you feel like you were in deep space. This particular combination of talent took the world by storm. For me, this was the start of great sci-fi.",10,0,1,23 July 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America The First Avenger had a lot of heart!
","Marvel unleashes a new superhero movie, Captain America, in a World War II setting. Captain America was created by a wonderful scientist who believed that a super soldier could stop the war. The government naturally wanted to capitalize on the super soldier rather than letting him do the job that he was created for. He hated what the government was making him do and he knew that he had to save his friends who were fighting in the war and protect the country. So the first avenger has been created in the Marvel line of super heroes. This movie shows a lot of courage in fighting the bad guys including the Red Skull. I thought this movie did better than the comic books did.",9,0,2,4 May 2014
Man of Steel," Man Of Steel was very exciting!
","Man of Steel was the greatest Superman movie ever made. The sound effects were amazing, the soundtrack was beautiful, and the settings looked real.Henry Cavill who played 'Clark Klent' was the best Superman in the Superman franchise and his suit looked better too. Amy Adams who played 'Lois Lane' did a great job of playing that character. Michael Shannon who played 'General Zod' was a tough super villain that almost defeated Superman. Russell Crowe who played Superman's father, 'Jor-El' was the wisest character in the movie.The fight scenes were amazing, the spaceships looked real, and the ending was great.They've FINALLY made a great Superman movie.",9,7,11,3 March 2014
Batman Begins," Batman Begins was such a great reboot!
","Batman Begins was a reboot that takes you into real city rather than a cartoon city.Christian Bale as 'Bruce Wayne' is such a great character that became the Batman by facing his fears of bats which took a lot courage. I feel that Michael Caine as 'Alfred' was the wisest friend that Bruce had ever known. Morgan Freeman who played 'Lucius Fox' was a great inventor that worked for Thomas Wayne (which was Bruce Wayne's father) for many years. Cillian Murphy as 'The scarecrow' was a sick minded villain that gave people hallucinogenic drugs to scare people and put them under his control. Liam Neeson who was the real 'Ra's Al Ghul' trained Batman and in the end, his training allowed him to put an end to Ra's Al Ghul who was the main villain of Gotham City.Hans Zimmer did a brilliant job of making the Batman soundtrack and it's themes. He can be very entertaining and very dramatic and sometimes he could do both at the same time.Batman Begins should've been the first Batman movie. Tim Burton's version didn't have a good story nor great characters like 'Batman Begins'.",8,2,3,29 March 2014
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight was incredible!
","The Dark Knight was one of the best Batman movies ever made. The acting was great, the soundtrack was awesome, the sound effects were incredible, and the settings looked great.Christian Bale's Batman is one of my favorite superheroes. He has a lot of heart and he is very, very strong. Heath Ledger who played 'The Joker' was a genius character and the greatest Batman villain in the whole franchise. Aaron Eckhart who played 'Harvey Dent/Two-Face' was a another great good guy that turned into a villain. I really thought that he looked scary when half of his face was burnt off and looked like a red skeleton.The story was thrilling, the action scenes were intense, and fight scenes were great.This movie was great from the beginning to the end!!!",10,1,3,3 March 2014
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes was such a smart movie!
","Sherlock Holmes will take you back in time. It had a great soundtrack, cool action scenes,and amazing acting.Robert Downey Jr. who played 'Sherlock Holmes' was a genius character that thinks really fast and knows just about everything. Jude Law who played 'Dr.John Watson' was Sherlock's great friend and helped him so many times. Rachel McAdams as 'Irene Adler' was a clever thief that could trick Sherlock to get what she wanted. And Mark Strong who played 'Lord Blackwood' was a very smart character that made people worship him in all different ways.The fight scene looked like they were really fighting and the dialogue was very clever.Sherlock Holmes was fantastic through the whole movie!!",9,1,2,15 March 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," What a perfect way to close the trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises.
","'YOU GOTTA LOVE BATMAN!' Let's be truthful, this Batman was different because they had to tie up a lot of lose ends that were left from 'The Dark Knight.' Christian Bale proves once again to be the best DC Batman. The film also introduced several new characters that made for interesting plot development. Anne Hathaway was a great Catwoman and a perfect match for Batman. Morgan Freeman as Mr.Fox is the greatest whizkid that Batman could ever have as a friend. Alfred once again came through as a great friend, mentor, and loving family member for Bruce Wayne helping him through his final task as the Batman. This is a great close to the successful Batman franchise.",7,0,1,15 June 2014
Thor: The Dark World," Thor The Dark World was terrific!
","Thor The Dark World was a thrilling sequel that takes you into space and all nine realms.This movie is intense, and makes you have all different emotions.Chirs Hemsworth who played 'Thor' is such an awesome character that is very wise and very strong. I thought that Natalie Portman who played 'Jane Foster' did better in this movie than the first one because she was cooler and tougher. Tom Hiddleston who played 'Loki' he can be dramatic, funny, and mean. He has some great personalities. Christopher Eccleston who played 'Malekith' was one of the toughest super villains in the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2' so far. He was unstoppable compared to Loki.I thought that Brian Tyler did a great job of making 'Thor The Dark World' soundtrack and it's themes, it sounded beautiful.This movie should've been the beginning of the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2', because 'Iron Man 3' SUCKED, big time!!",8,2,3,26 March 2014
