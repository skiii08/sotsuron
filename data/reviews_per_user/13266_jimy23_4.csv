The Avengers," The ultimate superhero action movie.
",This is what action adventure is all about yes it is clustered but thats hardly something to criticize. This has to be one of the best comic book based movie i have Ever seen the main villain is no Heath Ledger-Joker but Loki does work as the main Antagonist I think maybe there Should have been other well known Marvl villains in the movie. All the Characters work well Robert Doweny Jr and Samuel L Jackson were At there best. A first the team can't get along this is just what Loki wants he lets himself get captured to sabotage the group anyone who knows anything about Loki knows no mortal prison can hold him. Thor start off a odds with the rest of the Avengers because he wants Loki to face justice in Asgard Loki wants to start a war against Earth using a power cube. The battle at the end was amazing there are so many action scenes this is what superhero action movies are all about its not dark and edgy it's a fun ride. For anyone who hasn't seen it yet but wants to I am not going to spoil it but don't leave the theater before the first set of credits are over I give it a ten and hope to see part 2.,10,2,6,21 May 2012
Ratatouille," Adorable Pixar tale.
",Like many other Pixar movies this is a modern animated classic it's the story of Remy a rat who has a passion for cooking and unlike other rats he won't eat just any thing he finds. Remy meets a young wannabe Chef at a restaurant who find out Remy is a cooking rat and has him help him in becoming a master chef. Linguini's boss Skinner knows something is up and sets out to expose him Skinner also exploits and commercializes Remy's late idol Auguste Gusteau buy selling many different products with Auguste's image on it. It's not so much a comedy but it has a great story like many other Pixar movies it proves that animated movie don't have to be that funny to work it' one of the few pixar movies i have seen in the theater. The ending is very happy and it show rats in a good light something that almost never happens there's also a subplot of Remy's family's who don't think rats should be clean or coexist with humans. It is a great family movie that shows how it's not bad to be different and unlikely friendships can work out. This was originally not going to be a Disny movie it was going to be Pixer's first movie without Disny before the company's got back together. Ps. there is also a mock buster movie called Ratatoing that i haven't seen yet but i plan to and review.,10,3,5,21 May 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," One of the best Disney movie in sometime.
",Like the Emprors new groove and Lilo and Stich this is a different kind of Disney Feature it seems more like a Pixar or Dreamwork Animated Feature. Ralph is a villain from an 80's video game who wants to be a hero because they have more respect and a better reputation he tries to win a medal in another game but gets sent to a candy land like game called sugar rush. There he meets Vanellope Von Schweetz a game glitch or so it seems She gets staticity or buggy at times like a game glitch will sometimes do.Wreck it Ralph's hero Fix it Felix and Calhoun an action game hero go to sugar rush to get Ralph and Destroy a bug creature that got into the game. Ralph and Vanellope bound making a car for a big race but King Candy who is in the race is against Vanellope racing.Video Gamers and vintage arcade buffs will like this there are many old school arcade and modern game references such In the movie Weck it Ralph is celebrating 30 years many video game and arcade characters make appearances throughout the movie. Where Brave a Pixar movie seems like a Disney movie this seems like Pixar or Dreamworks movie It reminds me a lot of Shrek This could be the beginning of a new Animated movie franchise.,9,0,3,28 November 2012
Inception," Fascinating tale that keeps you thinking.
",I first saw this at the theater it had a lot of hype and Oscar buzz. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Cobb who hiding out Because he's been blamed for his wife's death really she killed herself thinking she was in a dream. Mainly the movie is about the power of dreams such things are shown and brought up like a dream within a dream Trinkets that the main characters have to prove if they are in a dream Cobb has a top that keeps spinning if he's in a dream Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt) has die that lands on same number if he's in a dream if someone die's in a dream they go into a deep sleep for years. The main plot is Cobb trying to prove his Innocents with help of a girl named Ariadne who the newest member of this team she learns how to manipulate dreams this makes for some surreal scenes she and Cobb build a model maze in real life then build a giant one in there dream. There is so many odd things in this movie but you have to think about it in the final story-line Cobb Ariadne and the gang go into Robert Fishers (Cillian Murphy's) dream on a plane to America to finally clear Cobb's name and put an end to his guilt. This is A lot like Science of sleep and even similar to Nightmare on Elm street on how those movie are about the power of dreams.I give it an 8/10,8,1,5,31 December 2011
