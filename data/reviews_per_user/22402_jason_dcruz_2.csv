Requiem for a Dream," style (and not even stylish style) over substance
","After all the hype, I was a little disappointed with this flick.  The characters are two-dimensional and never developed, and so the movie resorts to extremes of suffering, pain, and humiliation to elicit an emotive response from the viewer.  It's kind of akin to a drunken storyteller at a bar who is always afraid of losing your attention, so he exaggerates and he lies.There is definitely a lot eye-candy in this film, but even the 'innovative cinematography' often comes off as gimmicky and pointless.Sometimes power lies in restraint.",6,1,2,7 May 2002
Mystic River," mystifying reception
","The good reviews this movie garners never cease to amaze me: I thought it was a steaming pile! Melodramatic, sententious, and oddly macho, this is one of the most over-rated movies of all time. It is 'drama' in the worst sense of the word. The movie is horribly contrived. Eastwood attempts to artificially infuse the film with emotional 'heft' by heavy-handedly inserting an orchestral swell here, or an anguished look there. The only thing 'mystic' about this movie is why so many people seem to think it has any depth. It's one of the most unsubtle movies I've seen in a long time.",4,5,10,10 January 2005
