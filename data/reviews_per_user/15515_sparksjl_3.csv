First Man," A wonderful, full dimension piece of history, made into a two dimensional flop/
","This could have been done better, if James Cameron had been asked to just make a 'go to the moon movie'. The history of this event was removed and having watching it intently when it was happening live, I was disappointed beyond words that the pride I felt when seeing the American flag in 1969, was purposely omitted. Of course Ryan Gosling was chic and stylish enough to admit his Canadian birth gives him a 'cognitive bias', what ever the heck that means, except possibly, it is his way of saying this wasn't an American accomplishment but more of a 'We Are The World' Moment. He explained for the producers that, 'I think this was widely regarded in the end as a human achievement and that's how we chose to view it,' the actor told The Telegraph. 'I also think Neil was extremely humble, as were many of these astronauts, and time and time again he deferred the focus from himself to the 400,000 people who made the mission possible.' Well. no Ryan, you have that butt backwards and upside down. yes, Neil Armstrong as well as all the crews of Apollo missions were humble men but they were first and foremost Americans. The history of this included the often overlooked time of a heightened Cold War, when getting into space and to the Moon was as much an effort to keep the former Soviet Union from possibly weaponizing both as it was for exploration. Of course, Neil Armstrong and those of the Apollo missions are gone and could not be consulted as advisors or for their opinions regarding the political non-statements. I gave this movie one star because it could have been done FAR better and it could have actually followed the true history instead of what the current political climate of anti-Americanism. In historical films, either show the true history. or don't make it at all. Unless of course they want to start making movies that the the Confederate States as the good guys and the North as oppressors. Tell me how that would play in Poughkeepsie.",1,13,22,27 October 2018
First Man," Worst movie I've seen in a while.
","This film took a wonderful opportunity to tell a great story of history and turned it into a bad, bad documentary. If an actor could be a one dimensional cardboard cutout, it would be Ryan Gosling in this film. But then again, he has never gotten beyond two dimensions in any film. Having met Neil Armstrong, I can tell you he was no the paint drying on the wall personality Gosling portrays him to be. I know a lot of this is producers and directors and especially, writers. My take away from this film was, it was a great opportunity to scan for new music on my phone.",1,3,8,19 January 2019
Platoon," It was good but...
","I do not watch Vietnam movies because having served in the war, most are far from the reality my expediences of combat. However Oliver Stone did a great job of bringing his own wartime experience to the screen. Charlie Sheen was not the first choice for his part and his performance showed why. He apparently left a lot of his character wisping away in the smoke of a hash pipe and not in the movie. Worse and by that I mean THE worst actor (not character) but actor was Kevin Dillon. Having watched Entourage and enjoying it, except for Dillon, he also caused my 7/10 score for Platoon. It was just Johnny Drama in Vietnam and Entourage was Bunny survives the war (unfortunately) and goes to Hollywood. Dillon in everything I have watched him in, is a stiff, cardboard cutout of someone that should be there but didn't show up. He has only 2 facial expressions, bad attempts to smile and worse attempts to frown, from which he tries to cover the entire range of a characters emotional actions and responses.Willem Defoe, Tom Berenger and Forest Whitaker were the three main actors who along with several others rated this movie a 7 for me. The soundtrack was great, the cinematography was excellent and for that Oliver Stone deserves his awards. I have however watched my last anything with Kevin Dillon anywhere in it. In all, I do so wish Mr. Stone had looked further than Charlie Sheen for an actor, a real actor anyway, and for my money the movie would have been better without the character of Bunny entirely if Dillon was the only choice.
