Minority Report," Seems like the perfect movie, excluding its complete adsurdity sometimes.
","Spielberg is one of my favorite directors and there has never been a motion picture that he directed of which I can say something not quite good. Minority Report is no different. It's pretty different from the movies we see today and it's quite close in some ways to Spielberg last film A.I. - Artificial Intelligence. The only thing that keeps coming to me is the moment where John Anderton came back to the police station to get the girl-precog. He used his original eyes to get in. Okay, tell me, how is such negligence possible? The whole police are looking for him, nonetheless, they didn't even deny his very access to their station. This doesn't look like something really important but if you think about it, the plot would have been a lot different.However, this is not enough to wreck the fun. Minority Report is a great movie and I strongly recommend it.Grade: 8",8,0,0,3 January 2003
