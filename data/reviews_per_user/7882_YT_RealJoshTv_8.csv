Blade Runner 2049," Snoozefest
","With such a high rating, long running length, Harrison ford and Ryan gosling.. should be a smash hit, sadly it was a snoozefest. The movie wants to show off the world it created, it spends minutes of character standing with a weird look on their face thinking. I did enjoy the atmosphere but it was pushed to much, I kept getting bored and losing site on plot details.There is a typical action story that is interwoven throughout the movie but is added in with so much extra it's hard to stay into it. There were a few violent parts which I thought was nice, kind of like an r rated starwars. And it had some interesting ideas with robots and holograms, but it just wasn't for meShorten all the filler scenes and this movie would have been better imo no where near an 8, I wouldn't watch this again or recommend it personally",6,5,9,28 March 2020
Fight Club," One of the best
","I first saw this movie in 2007 and have since seen it countless times as well as again in theaters in 2009 for some special 10th anniversary small showing in theaters. i had heard bits and pieces about it through the years and i always got the vibe that it was some surface level pretty boy movie with a little edge. how more wrong could i be, this movie has lots of bizarre scenes and a totally unique way of story telling, and some people get lost before the movie really begins to make sense. if you were to stop halfway through the movie you wouldn't have any idea how it all ends. i do feel however that this is most appealing to younger men who have yet to develop a strong personality as i was when i first watched it. i am unsure on how much my age at the time tied in with my obsession with this movie for months after i watched it. its dark and bound for certain people not to enjoy it based on all its uniqueness but i can honestly say there are probably less than 15 movies I would give all 10 star reviews on and this is one. in my opinion for a movie to get 10 starts it must have told a perfect story in all parts beginning to end and not leave me feeling that they could have done anything better for the story they are trying to tell and this movie for me has it all.",10,0,2,15 January 2015
The Babadook," Don't Expect Epic Horror
","I had very high hopes for this movie and was slightly let down only because i expected a legendary horror film. The story is more about the mom and son than than babadook itself. This film had very good scares and unsettling scenes of the highest caliber, good acting and a good soundtrack. It was made with a low amount of money but you rarely notice it, the babadook is very scary itself but the way things play out it doesn't seem scary at all after the film was over. I watched with my wife and neither of us were afraid or left unsettled like some of the reviewers have posted. It's sad that they didn't capitalize on his scariness because his appearances were some of the most unsettling scenes i've seen in any movie. If the director held it's suspense and climaxed with more of the unsettling bits this movie would be truly terrifying and would have set a new standard for leaving viewers uneasy and terrorized. Still worth watching for the suspenseful moments in my opinion though.",7,2,4,22 April 2015
Interstellar," Expectations were too high
",I feel that movies these days don't immerse you into the story and setting like the older movies. So when i heard the basic plot and high reviews of this film i thought this movie might just take me there. To start with the positive it had a very imaginative script/story and the scenes of Mcconaughey were very emotional and touching. The problem i have with this movie is that it repeatedly pushes reality more and more and more to the point where it's kind of hard to stay with whats happening. It ended well but it doesn't make any sense how you end up there. Also there is a mystery character 2/3 of the way through the movie that was completely pointless sub story that pushed drama for the sake of drama. I like the idea in which this character entered and the actor who played him but for what transpires he might as well have just stayed out of the movie. Still a solid movie but i wasn't left in shock by greatness like some viewers have reported.,8,0,4,23 April 2015
The Fast and the Furious," Nostalgic
","I saw this movie first in 2003 and was instantly sucked into the series, i've seen fast five and fast six which did this movie justice but i don't think they can duplicate the feeling i get from watching this film. it feels so much like the time period it was shot in and the chemistry all the main street racers share in the middle of this movie feels gone forever. i recently watched this movie again after Paul walker died because i feel that was the final nail in the coffin on my hope for seeing another movie that felt like this. i like all f and f movies in the series especially the newest ones which are surprisingly more entertaining to me and that 2fast and Tokyo drift but the new ones are like their own movie without the same flow just like this movie is and I'm sad to see it pretty much gone forever but at least they created the new movies and created them well so we have more than just the first few rip Paul walker.",9,8,11,15 January 2015
It Follows," I liked it
","Let's start with pro's, it was a unique horror/thriller with a plot i've never seen or thought of before. There was nothing that took me out of the moment completely. There are lots of unique camera angles that do a good job in making you feel in the situation. To give an example when you learn what the entity is/how it works there are a good amount of shots that make you feel like you never know when you will see it coming. Also there were only like 3 jump scares, my girlfriend and I didn't know what was going to happen or how it would end. Now to the few con's, there are too many times that they do something stupid that could have been avoided to get more suspense out of the situation, it slightly took away to the realness feel of the situation. Also I felt that this movie would have benefited from a more sneaky complex plan to handle or deal with the entity, sometimes there is no out of the box kind of thinking amongst the group. All in all though i really liked it and the freshness of the story, definitely worth a watch. For the people who say not enough was explained about certain parts, i feel like there was an aura of mystery to it and i in no way felt jipped out of parts in the story. And for the person who said sarcastically 'a plane ticket was out of the question' there are lots of problems with that scenario in my opinion, i don't want to give any parts of the story away explaining why i think that but when i think of how it works doing something like that would have to be very planned out and timed to perfection for it work with the way the entity works.",8,39,78,6 June 2015
Pulp Fiction," Love this movie
","A masterpiece through and through, i figure by now everyone knows and has reviewed this movie but what the heck its that good and that timeless/classic. Everything is on point from the story, to the story telling, to the actors, to the music chosen and all the little side conversations/side story's. Some scenes are shot in one long take and really make you feel like your there more than a mash of different shots. Riddled with memorable lines and almost an feeling of cool in the air as odd as that may sound. A bit graphic and harsh at times but is never pointlessly violent, just enough to feel real. It doesn't more fast beginning to ending but when it does move fast it goes as fast as humanly possible. I have enjoyed every Quinten Tarentino movie I've ever watched but this takes the cake for me as the best and has yet to be duplicated",10,0,1,26 March 2015
Scream," One of the Best!
","I grew up in the 90's and remember the popularity of these scream masks, I had seen some references to scream throughout the years in movies, but had never watched one. I was revising older movies and everyone kept saying 'when scream changed everything'. I had always viewed scream as a dumb fake 90's comedy horror, boy was I wrong.I cannot tell you the treat I had watching this movie after all these years, it's like a horror movie that feels like the quality and fullness of a normal movie. Like I'm watching a blockbuster good horror movie which doesn't happen. I'm so thankfully I didn't know anything about the story and killer as that's most of the fun in these movies, whose the killer.This movie completely opened up my eyes to a different type of horror, I immediately without hesitation watched all the other scream movies after and had a blast. I remember telling myself I wish I could erase what happened from my brain so I can watch them again. I liked them that much.I also watched every movie I could find inspired by scream because I loved this movie so much, highly recommended. If you remember the 90's and haven't seen this movie, you are in for a treat, don't watch any more reviews just go see it!",8,0,0,28 March 2020
