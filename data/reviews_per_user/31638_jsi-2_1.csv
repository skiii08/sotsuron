It," Lost Opportunity to Make a Great Scary Movie
","I was so disappointed. Bill Skarsg√•rd was a great depiction of a scary clown, but, as another reviewer noted, the movie itself was scary--if you were a 10 year-old. There was just a lot of silliness that caused me to quickly lose interest.On a side note, it's been a while since I've been to the movies. I've been reading about how movie attendance is down. Maybe it's because of the morons who pay $11 a ticket and then spend the entire movie talking out loud or otherwise making noises they might do at home in front of their own TV.",4,24,49,12 September 2017
