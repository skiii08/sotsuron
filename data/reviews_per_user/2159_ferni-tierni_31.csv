Ford v Ferrari," Passion and Art vs Corporatism and Bureaucracy.
","The immersion of this movie in the racing scenes was stunning, incredible, extraordinary. I sensed Ken Mile's (Christian Bale) desire to obliterate all records and set himself as a Legend in Le Mans. Rarely do movies submerge me into a state of mind that gives me psychosomatic experiences. Those races are large portion of the movie and just like for the pilots we feel their relativity vicariously. The movie is a concerning two hours and thirty minutes, but in no point, in the entire movie, does it get dull, boring, redundant. We get a story-telling that is passionate, nuanced, idiosyncratic, and moralistic. Kudos to James Mangold.A beautiful highlight of the movie was the shots at the Le Mans. The viewer gets a sense of what Ken Miles is experiencing. We also understand a modicum of both the intuition and knowledge of the pilot as he is attempting to measure and calibrate the reaction times and distances. His son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe) and Mollie Miles (Caitriona Balfe) were an important inclusion in many of those scenes to remind us that despite his relentless desire for success, he was still a multi-dimensional character with decency and compassion, despite his crazy antics.The plot follows a perfect pace to provide us with the necessary details to understand the contention between Ford and Ferrari but also make it short enough to not lose our attention with too many character building or dialogue. We immediately recognize the temperament, character, values, and ambition of both Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and Ken Miles as they attempt to circumvent bureaucracy, corporatism, greed, and mediocrity. I would have enjoyed more emotion from both protagonists, but the tone that was set was maybe emulating the real life story of both, even in their character and personality.The movie reaches a resolution that can leave a bittersweet sensation to many, but the process to reach the moral of the story, many of the times can be more turbulent than expected, sometimes is far more complicated than visualized; there were definitely a lot of factors at play in the unfolding. It is refreshing to see that the protagonist, who was undoubtedly, could even be said obsessed with success, ultimately did not care for the plaudits and trophies of Le Mans. One can say that the process of becoming better was the alluring feature in his experience of racing cars.",10,1,2,2 May 2020
The King's Speech," Analysis/ Opinion Every time I saw him stammer while public speaking I suffered with him.
","The King's SpeechBeing a person that has suffered from stage fright in my past, I felt pain watching Prince George give a speech. Colin Firth's brilliant performance as the struggling prince that was crippled from childhood and had to claw back from the abyss into the light of public exposure was beautifully sympathetic. Every time I saw him stammer while public speaking I suffered with him, but the empathy the movie elicited glued me to the tv experiencing his venture of self-discovery and identity.The movie was surreptitiously introducing elements in the atmosphere in a way that added to the narrative: Lionel's reception of George in the first therapy session where he gets greeted by his son as a way to show the king that he has been able to help people improve, the stories with his children as a way of demonstrating that he has a family that loves him despite all his flaws, Lionel treating him as his child when George's father dies and listening to his story of abuse when he was younger, Lionel treating George as an adult after his entire confession by offering him alcohol. All these little gestures add priceless features to the tone of the movie and help Lionel establish a connection with Bertie and transform George into a multi-dimensional and admirable person, despite his condition.There is so much background information added into understanding George's stammering. It is rich in psychological content to humanize him. George suffered abandonment and abuse when he was a child; he felt his voice was not valuable enough to be heard. This is why every time he got angry his stammering largely disappeared and when he was confronted to his brothers his stammering was amplified. Lionel explained the connection of abandonment to his condition and that it was a result of nurture and not nature. George was repeatedly attempting to escape his royal duties in diverse ways. George's father admitted that he wants him to be afraid of him just like he was of his father. George is also afraid of his own shadow and wants to stay away from the public eye, while living in mitigated fear. All of these details bring George's condition to a new complexity.The dialogue is also good. Poor and content is rich and rich enough is a quote from Shakespeare that gave so much dimension to the character in a time where he needed to connect with the English aristocracy. The dialogue between Lionel and George where they contend for equality and separation is also brilliant in explaining the process that Lionel attempted to conduct in therapy. There are scenes where the dialogue is highly eloquent and articulate and also others where King George despite his limitations was able to speak eloquently.I really recommend this movie to people that are suffering from public speaking or have difficulty being themselves, because it goes into topics few movies cover, and it does it in a way that is ample with phenomenological content.",10,0,0,26 March 2020
Training Day," Best Crooked Cop Performance I've seen thus far.
","Training Day is a fast paced maniacal, dirty, crude whirlwind that will leave you reflecting on how you would deal with the ambushes and immorality that Hoyt faced. Are you a wolf or are you a shepherd? Only a wolf can catch wolves. Alonzo's philosophy justified many of the actions he made, but clearly understood the type of person that he was and what he had become. We never knew if Alonzo actually was a good cop at the beginning of his career, but his personality is so crass, vulgar, and duplicitous one can only conclude that he was the crooked cop all along.Ethan as Hoyt gives a good performance as the rookie cop that is hopeful and morally driven. We get some slight instances of character development at the beginning of the movie that solidified his character, but he was largely able to carry himself the persona of authenticity and naivety that was needed for that role. He was continually manipulated by Alonzo and walked the fine line between being submissive and not being weak, excellently. The gestures offered by the movie were brilliant. Hoyt fought and restrained two homeless people that were attempting to rape a teenager, stark contrast to Alonzo just watching and then releasing them after giving them a severe and savage 'street' lesson. We were reminded repeatedly the temperament and value structure of both Alonzo and Hoyt.The street smart is a recurrent theme in the movie. It was clear at the onset that Hoyt had to forget everything he heard in the academy and adapt to Alonzo's philosophy to be able to survive. I would say that the ability to connect with people on the streets gave Alonzo some needed advantage to be able to infiltrate the circles that he needed to police, but the clear issue was to not transform into those criminals, but, as he mentioned, he needed to become a wolf like them to be able to catch them. The fascinating part about this movie is the complexity and ruthlessness that the streets conditions are displayed for people that want to make a meaningful change. A clear quandary is presented to the viewer where we are invited to reflect on complex and innovative ways to understand the sadist, vicious, uncertain dynamics of the streets.Ultimately, the message sent by the movie is that corrupt cops will eventually get punished for their decisions. Alonzo was playing too many people and ended having no people he could trust or depend on. Hoyt was saved by the sole just action that he did the entire day, providential or maybe unlikely, but the movie teaches us that if anyone aims to construct any change, it cannot be done by a single person, and no one will trust to take that path with you if you continue being duplicitous.",10,0,1,20 April 2020
Fight Club," Analysis/ Opinion The fight symbolizes the protagonist reviving his ability to fight against a monster that is habituation.
","The first time I saw this movie I was 13 years old. I had limited ability to cogitate the dimension of the bomb that was chucked into my mind, but my intuitions recognized that this was something special. I am a 31 year old right now. I just watched the movie for a 4th time, and recognized that here is a ridiculous amount of esoteric information thrown to the viewer and with such a unique style that it is passionately invigorating. It hits a chord that wakes up your soul and stimulates you to rebel against otherwise invisible entities. How habituated are we to consumerism? How has consumerism shaped our identity? How much is consumerism debilitated us at diverse dimensions and levels? How alienated are we from our noble savage that we have turned to selfishness and malevolence?We are presented with the protagonist (Edward Norton). He sets off an identity crisis after accidentally setting fire to his apartment. In the earlier scenes of that movie we see him decorating meticulously every single object of his apartment, like the objects he owns are his identity. 'You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.'After the protagonist's commodities are gone he goes into a mental breakdown where he literally has no place where he belongs, no place to stay. Under the severe affliction he meets Tyler Durden. 'You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You are not your  khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.' Tyler delivers a powerful philosophical dialogue that seems to be exactly what the protagonist needs to hear. Before the night is over Tyler challenges him to a fight. Now this is the critical part about the movie. The fight symbolizes the protagonist reviving his ability to fight against a monster that is habituation. Tyler says: How much do you know about yourself if you have never been in a fight? Basically what it means is if you have not fought for something you believe in to the death, how much you know about what you can accomplish. Tyler teaches him to wake up and care. Care that he has been abused by the system and consumerism to the point that he has a mental breakdown after losing his possessions. Act on the injustice, develop convictions, ideas, care, and become humane, via learning how to fight, fight for what he cares about. This is the central idea of fight club. We are going to teach you to care.The movie has deep psychological teachings about habituation. At some point of the movie Tyler sends off members of the fight club to fight random people on the street. He specifically instructed them to lose. He wanted to hit the most primal sensation in human beings when they are attempting to survive a life or death circumstance and help them believe that they can win and defeat their fears. He metaphorically attempts to face Carl Jung's shadow. A person cannot be good if he has not learned to dominate his shadow (shadow symbolizing the control the person has to participate in deliberate destruction). Tyler's philosophy aims to make his fighters develop discipline, convictions, identity, resiliency, humanity, fearlessness, and solidarity. Tyler is conducting a concerted effort to target the original and elusive culprit of the fighter's inability to be happy in society. Why are you unhappy in this society? Maybe you need some of Tyler's philosophy.Before the protagonist met Tyler he was deep in an identity crisis. He had chronic insomnia, a job that he found with lack of meaning, materialistic ideas and behaviors, lack of discipline, lack of ability to suffer, and loneliness. He was suffering navigating through the Jungian analytical process of individuation. Before he could develop and establish an identity that was resilient to consumerist bombardment he had to face his deepest fears and face his shadow. Why have we not faced our shadow? Why are we incapable of being humane? Why do we not have the collective ability to end wars? Why are we so bad at constructing healthy relationships? Why do we struggle sacrificing and suffering for others? The protagonist in the movie understood that Tyler's philosophy was going to emancipate him from his suffering and help him discover his ego and shadow, and allow him to progress to also discovering his anima, animus, and old wise man (archetypes of the collective unconscious).Anyone that wants to understand this movie and the criticism it does to materialism and consumerism is in for an entertaining, passionate, unique, and frenetic ride. The soundtrack is one of the best I've seen in any movie. The intensity of the scenes is high and the grim violence can be disturbing, but makes it up with witty comedy and a genius dialogue that achieves a deep analysis few movies have demonstrated. I personally have not read the book, but feel satisfied with this masterpiece that transcends anything that I ask of a movie.",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Analysis/Opinion The Nazis are a relentless, organized, indomitable force that is symbolized by two characters: Colonel Landa and Major Hellstrom.
","'People should either be caressed or crushed. If you do them minor damage they will get their revenge; but if you cripple them there is nothing they can do. If you need to injure someone, do it in such a way that you do not have to fear their vengeance.'
Niccolo MachiavelliThis is in simpler terms the ethos of almost every character of the movie. It is maniacal if not sadist the style of how the characters get their gruesome job done, and is as if their identity depended on it: the Jew Hunter, Aldo the Apache, Little Man, The Bear Jew. Tarantino effectively wrote a movie in which your sadist ways define you. Col Landa was the least infatuated with violence, but nonetheless clinically effective and inquisitively meticulous on his 'detective' role. There are so many interesting gestures on how Col. Landa navigates a fine line between charisma, sophistication, politeness, and ruthless merciless violence. He is a predator with his prey in his jaw boisterously playing with it with his wordplay.The movie is not a historical documentary: It is CLEAR fiction gentlemen. Many people are understandably annoyed, angry, enraged? The movies audacity to portray a fictional world where a guerrilla force terrorizes Nazis as retribution for all the atrocities they committed hits a special place in people. We have all at different levels felt at least uncomfortable at the pain and injustice of the suffering of Jews in the holocaust. Tarantino exploits that sentiment and makes you go on an emotional ride that gives you free reign to fantasize on the injustices; you care immediately for the characters.
The messages are clear on the onset. The Nazis are a relentless, organized, indomitable force that is symbolized by two characters: Colonel Landa and Major Hellstrom. Yes, Adolf Hitler is the leader of the party and is an excellent strategist, but the main focus of the power and extension of the Nazi prowess in the movie are these two characters; they are the main resistance to the Basterds intentions. Conversely, the Basterds and Shosanna are the architects of the sacrificial revenge exerted on the Nazis, and it is irresistible to not cheer and get animated by their success. This is the beauty of this movie that in many of the tense scenes the viewer gets so invested in the survival and success of the basterds that we can't help but justify their actions albeit being gory and borderline sadist.The fantasy of a guerilla army stopping the genocide of the Nazi party is especially delicious, but an infiltrator that exemplifies all the positive qualities aforementioned in the form of Col. Landa was even more exquisite. Colonel Landa was a detective and a very pragmatic one at that, molding himself depending on who he was talking to, but permanently charismatic and vibrant. The Basterds, despite the opportunity to end the war that Landa provided them, were not satisfied with just letting Landa leave in peace and pleasure. They had to brand him as a person that was not able to escape the conceptual vengeance of their guerilla army. Yes, he betrayed the Nazi Party and rightly so, but, seriously, a man like Colonel Landa is not compatible with the philosophy of the Nazi Party, right?",10,1,2,20 March 2020
The Danish Girl," Chirpy and vibrant atmosphere of the bohemian life that transitions into a meaningful evolution of personal identity and sacrifices of unconditional love.
","Einar (Eddie Redmayne) is a sensitive, hopeful, submissive painter that lives the unconvential bohemian lifestyle with his wife Gerda (Alicia Vikander). We recognize immediately in the first scenes of the movie the personalities of each protagonist and how they complement. Gerda, the choleric, flirtatious, domineering, fickle wife is struggling to make an impact in the painting scene of 1920s Denmark. They are both creative and free in an atmosphere where emotions are clearly a critical aspect of their work; Einar starts to question his own identity when he participates in cross-dressing modeling and recognizes new sensations that excite him profusely.In the initial stages of his transformation the viewer might intuit that this is simply one of the whims of the bohemian lifestyle, but as Einar starts to discover his emotions and identity the viewer starts to understand the complexity of his situation. It is not simply what demeanor, expressions, persona, image Einar decides to show to world, but his issue becomes multi-faceted as he decides to understand at a deeper level what he wants from life, how he wants to exist.Einar's entire transformation puts Gerda's love and acceptance to the test. It is as if her frolicking nature got a bittersweet turn of events and Gerda had to endure the turbulent process that Lili decided to undergo. It is an interesting turn of narrative where Hans starts to become interested in Gerda, having been his first experience where Einar explores the sexual and emotional affection of men, but I believe the story would have turned too gloomy and depressive for the viewer if we would not get a reward for all the sacrifice that Gerda had to make after following and accompanying Einar in transitioning to Lili. The movie succeeds in carrying an elaborate plot and finding a resolution that would display the importance of identity in the complex self-discovery of sexuality and image. It also poses difficult questions for the viewer in relation to the boundaries of acceptance, unconditional love, identity, and sexuality.",8,0,1,16 April 2020
Molly's Game," Good story, mediocre casting, bad dialogue.
","Molly's Game delivers on two fronts: a deep story about a flawed human being in search for success and remembrance and a criticism on the dynamics of gambling. Jessica Chastain as Molly navigates us through a good performance, not mediocre, but definitely not memorable. I did not really cared for her experience that much, because she didn't manage to evoke any strong feelings from me. She remained too impassive for prolonged periods of the film, to the point that I did not care about her success in her business. The movie was entertaining. For a person that is not an avid poker fan and knows little to none on the dynamics, this was fresh and detailed. The movie delivered a way for the amateur to feel comfortable and understand the story engagedly.I appreciate the profound display of Molly's life and motivations. The movie felt like it was going through the experience of many characters rather than have a prominent protagonist. What kept me always at least interested in the protagonist were the continuous gestures of analysis of her intentions and experiences in a relatable way. Some gestures felt a bit serendipitous or forced into the story, but it was not a drastic change that ruined the whole experience of the movie. The voice-over and dialogue felt a bit too fast paced for my taste, but it also added vitality and flavor. I am usually more irritated by a slow pace that disperses my attention than a fast-paced dialogue that might not give enough depth to the narrative but keeps me immersed.I appreciated the subtle criticisms of gambling that occurred in the movie. Yes, it is talking about a woman that was able to escape legal consequences from starting an illegal gambling ring, but it also details the negative emotional, physical, and mental repercussions of immersing oneself into those environments. In no way did she remain unscathed. She went through a complex transformation of character and integrity that was dignified.The story carries the movie. It is really eventful and descriptive, but uses too much voice-over and does not engage our imagination. Still an entertaining movie.",8,0,4,11 May 2020
The Matrix Revolutions," No one can see beyond a choice they cannot understand.
","Matrix Revolutions is expectedly a movie that delivers more action and resolution than the other films. Concordantly, the first few scenes displayed the struggle that humanity had against the machine invasion, and bane prowling through the real world aspirant for revenge. The explosion of success that both prequels enjoyed, justified a dignified closure that answered many of our remaining questions. We partially got that. Some holes in the plot remained unanswered, which seemed irresponsible considering the expectation people had of this movie, but some inclusions were also refreshing surprises.Immediately in the first scenes of the movie we feel the threat looming in the dialogue and the tension rising in various characters. The human resistance in Zion was one of my favorite parts of the movie. The vibrant desire to defend the banner of one's species was palpable. The characters demonstrated in their rendition the passion and convictions that they enjoyed in their desire to defend their species, brilliantly inspired by Nathaniel Lees as Mifune. We also get the other side of the coin by experiencing characters that symbolized peace, love, sacrifice, and devotion. Sati and her family were a good metaphor of the peace of mind that one can acquire in the abyss of loneliness by reaching a state of care and compassion. The father was even willing to lie to the Trainman and risk his chances of saving his daughter in order to help a stranger: this is the state of enlightenment.The Merovingian--the program that traffics on the why of people in the Matrix-trapped Neo in a program without any escape. Neo got impacted by a traumatizing event, where he does not understand how he was able to stop sentinels, and, subsequently, he was trapped in a program that has circular movement. The conceptual connections are interesting.The dialogue between the architect and the oracle is another metaphor of chaos and order. The architect is the creator of order in the matrix, and the oracle is the program that creates anomalies and chaos within the order, but also the program that its purpose is to examine human psyche. The oracle was the main catalyst for the peace between the machine and humanity to end the war. In the last dialogues, before agent smith duplicated her, she repeated continually a phrase: no one can see beyond a choice they cannot understand. The architect was never actually able to perceive the abilities of Neo and agent smith; he was never able to see beyond that. The only entity that was able to perceive the peace between the humans and the machines was the all-knowing oracle.Agent Smith was the polar opposite of NEO. He was an agent of destruction. Neo accomplished peace between the machines and the humans by the power of love, as clichÃ© as it sounds, and Agent Smith planned to self-replicate until he destroyed anyone that crossed in his way: Love vs Destruction. Ultimately, Neo by yielding to the power of the machines and sacrificing for the betterment of humanity was able to stop the extinction of humans.",9,0,0,1 May 2020
The Intouchables," In a matter of thirty minutes this movie reminded me of the magic and authenticity of the movies of the 90's
","In a matter of thirty minutes this movie reminded me of the magic and authenticity of the movies of the 90's: wholesome, complex, multi-dimensional, moralistic, philosophical, authentic, and humane. All of these adjectives perfectly apply to the invigorating tone and narrative that the 'intouchables' attempts to conduct and does excellently. Why does it hit a special spot though?The smiles, lighthearted fun, respect, companionship, unity, passion, and dedication are clear eidos showcased incisively to allure us into believing that a poor black man from the suburbs can establish an extraordinary relationship with a white aristocrat. The connection surpasses race, class, education, and ideology. In a time where we are overpoweringly divided by all types of distinctive identities here comes a movie that forgets all of that and shows us that sometimes if you put two people with a desire to connect all of those features seem insignificant.Driss' (Omar Sy) unintentional naiveté and WIDE smile gave a certain energy of happiness and authenticity that broke many of the barriers that Paul (Francois Cluzet) experienced. You truly felt that there was no other ulterior motive that to demonstrate unconventional friendships unfold through the desire to make each other happy and connect. Temperament, sense of humor, energy... were a clear catalyst, but both protagonists had a clear background of need and neglect. Driss adopted by his uncle and aunt was kicked out of his house and had to find some form of income to be able to survive his situation. He also never had a real family, so the prospect of becoming part of Paul's family, even if processed intuitively, was not a dreadful idea. Paul with an obvious need for connection and care was struggling finding a passion and a woman that could eclipse his past tragedies.Paul immediately connected with Driss' crude and inappropriate humor. Maybe he was exasperated with courtesies and niceties of the aristocratic life, or he was looking for people to be real with him. Driss was abrasive, despondent, improper, invasive, and careless, but also authentic; he had no problem confessing he was leeching off the welfare system. Eventually Driss becomes part of his life, literally an extension of him, as he suggests Paul to discipline his daughter or just to keep him company in the tribulations of handicapped life.The movie is seriously uplifting. Using Ludovico Einaudi's beautifully harmonious classical music, it amplifies the viewer's sensibilities to create an experience that gradually immerses you into a world where truly everyone can connect and overcome their struggles.",10,1,2,11 April 2020
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew McConaguhey at his best.
","Matthew McConaughey's performance stunned me, in a way that a beautiful painting does, where you gaze at it progressively more and recognize the depth and brilliance of it, just like that. Though I have to admit I have a soft spot for profound depictions of a character that showcases the multi-dimensional facets and leads us to experience him in a beautifully humane way. Ron (Matthew McConaughey) starts as this hyper-macho, intrepid, sexist, homophobic, hedonist that is addicted to sex, but as we get to know him better and the ravages of AIDS start to kick in, we see his beautiful evolution from a prejudiced, impatient, egotist to an acceptant, inclusive, and sacrificial person that attempts to live in an existential way. AIDS had to bully him into producing a legacy for himself, in an attempt to survive and find strength to live.Dr. Sevard (Denis O'Hare) was a really important element in the movie as the grim reaper for all these people with AIDS. It was the symbol of corruption, greed, and complicity within the hospital that Ron had to contend with. In the initial scenes we see Eve (Jennifer Garner) criticizing the brazenness of the pharmaceutical industry for pushing a medication that is not known to be safe for the public in order to make a profit, and Dr. Sevard gives her a gentle reality check when he justifies the industry's actions by calling it 'just business'.Eve is the symbol of hope of reforming the Medical services, a young, good-hearted, compassionate doctor that is resilient and unrelenting despite many obstacles, even by the sexism and impulsivity initially by Ron. She was repeatedly Ron's hope that what he was doing was actually making a difference in people's lives. Even when he was not successful at causing significant change against the pharmaceutical industry, the people with him, especially Eve was there inspiring him to do better. At the end he did leave a legacy, a legacy of hope and perseverance, that despite any pushback he was relentless in his desire to improve the lives of others.",10,0,1,15 April 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
","Despite Avengers being a Marvel commercialism and attempting to unite all these characters into a cohesive narrative, the movie does a good job of integrating them in a way that it does not feel forced or expendable. They all have their little cameo and do not have excessive presence that creates random and out of place scenes. I mean it somewhat does, but it is bearable. What makes this movie stand out above all superhero movies - except the Nolan's Batman Trilogy - is the deep meaning and implications of the clash of ideologies between Thanos and the Avengers.Thanos follows a narrative of a redeemer, a godly presence, coming to restore order in the universe. He is not a sadist; he even feels burdened by this purpose. At a certain instance he confesses: 'I ignored my destiny once, I cannot do that again'. He is one of the most humane villains I have seen in any movie. He is willing to risk everything to get the six infinity stones and reduce as much as possible the suffering of people by just snapping his fingers and disintegrating everyone. Simply Thanos wants to maximize the pleasure of all living beings by reducing population and providing everyone the resources for a happy existence, instead of what he perceives a chaotic and damaging organization of living beings.The dialogue is adequate: The avengers are continually given a chance to demonstrate their uniqueness and role. The directors gave them dialogue to express their idiosyncrasies and personality, and it was entertaining to watch the usual quips and jests by Iron Man or the Guardians of the Galaxy. Even though the movie was two hours and thirty minutes the movie never felt dull, and the inclusion of new scenes always had a purpose in the major plot. Maybe the movie had too many action scenes for my personal preference, but maybe I am asking too much from a Marvel film.Thanos achieving his goal the way he did was definitely a surprise, and I feel like I don't get surprised that often in films, so Kudos to the Directors for raising the tension repeatedly, and instead of, like in most movies, the superheroes achieving their goal we had a very spiritual, multi-faceted villain that accomplished his goal. I have to say that Thanos continually justified being a worthy villain to face all the avengers.",10,1,1,9 May 2020
Gone Girl," Amy Dunne is dark and passionate.
","Gone Girl is a thriller that has abundant flaws but also notorious qualities that eclipse any seemingly unforgiving flaws. Honestly, I truly enjoyed the movie despite the inconsistencies, plot holes, unaddressed events, absurd attitudes, etc. The movie does what a good thriller is supposed to do: keep you guessing from second one what is happening in the movie, present a complex situation in which the viewer has to evaluate the possibilities and discover along with the development of the movie twists and turns that keep the movie fresh.Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) delivers a masterful performance as the calculating and manipulating estranged wife that is obsessed in imparting punishment to her husband for his neglect and adulterous behavior. She is arrogant, spiteful, impassive, highly logical, a rational genius. We travel with her this regression from being a sensitive, intrigued, hopeful, and impassioned woman to becoming a calculating maniac and it is an artistic beauty to watch. Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) offers a performance that is maybe not up to par with Rosamund but adapts to the character well and gives a believable rendition. He showcases himself, despite her being the psychopath, as a dryer more taciturn and expressionless character than Amy. The fact that he does not show more emotion shackles his ability to aggrandize his performance to match Amy's.Gone girl's initial dialogue is some of the most interesting frolicking and astute banter that I have seen depicted in a movie in a long time. It is smart, quick witted, astute, perspicacious, works brilliantly at capturing your attention and demonstrates the stark chemistry between the two protagonists. It is the dialogue that I like to hear in interchanges between characters. The movie shows the viewer the position of privilege that both protagonists enjoy intellectually, which successively helps us believe the manipulating behavior that both are able to devise.Hey, I understand that the movie has ridiculous flaws in the plot, but the movie in my opinion presents us a proposition: Believe this story of two people that get ravaged, corrupted, disappointed by the effects of incompatibility in a relationship, and we will present you with one of the most unique stories of redemption, perseverance, and acceptance. Amy utters a dialogue that symbolizes the eidos of that couple: I have killed for you; who else can say that? You think you'd be happy with a nice Midwestern girl? No way, baby! I'm it.",8,0,0,26 April 2020
Django Unchained," Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
","A story of revenge, devotion, faith, aspirations, and sadism, relentless tragic indigestible sadism. What can I say about Tarantino that has not been said before? I will not chuck more wood into his already flaming fire; I will instead talk about the symbolism and plot of this movie: A charismatic and cultured foreigner in 1858 Texas had to be the one to bestow Django (Jamie Foxx) with a chance to challenge all the odds and save his wife from slavery in a plantation in Mississippi. Progressively both characters develop a friendship that will even position Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) in danger while attempting a heroic.The movie explores themes like sacrifice, acceptance, love, union, solidarity, betrayal. The scenes elucidate excellently the unbearable nature of the life for slaves; it is difficult to even glance at some scenes and ascertain the phenomenology of the slaves: the circumstances they endured. Few contemporary movies have tried to give us a detailed rendition of the phenomenology of slaves: 12 years as a slave, Harriet, Mudbound, come to mind. Django pushes our sensibilities and attempts to expand our understanding of the sadism and unjust reality that slaves were forced to endure. Extraordinary imaginative effort would be required to dimension the magnitude of their suffering without works of art like this one.The story of the wise man and the apprentice begins when Dr Schultz starts to make deals with Django to hunt criminals. Django learns lessons and skills that will, ultimately, allow him to face the biggest challenge he has had in his life, remain calm in the biggest storm he has ever experienced. He learns how to suppress his instincts and emotions to be able to receive criticism even from a black person being excessively servile to white people.Maybe revenge was not the best dish, but it paints a picture of drama and tragedy very emblematic in Tarantino's films. It also serves to amplify the passions of many of the characters that give absolutely outstanding performances: Calvin Candle (Leonardo DiCaprio), Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), and Broomhilda (Kery Washington). I'd like to highlight DiCaprio's performance as one of the best ones I have seen from him. His ability to go from 0-100 and make his character believable and simultaneously terrifying is masterful feature of this film that gets under-appreciated. His dialogue and antics are a highlight of the movie.Django had to pay the ultimate sacrifice for Broomhilda, but it was a sacrifice he was willing to make from the beginning of the movie. Despite all the immorality, sadism, hate, ignorance, and irreverence we see a gesture of sacrifice born out of care and love. It is rare to see Tarantino explore these topics, but it was beautifully displayed in the reencounter of Broomhilda and Django.",10,0,1,4 May 2020
Drive," You give me a time and a place and I give you a 5 min window...
","Drive attempts to hit a pace and atmosphere and succeeds spectacularly. Underground, dedicated, moralistic, faithful, limited, passionate: so many admirable features to describe the film. A faint experience of averageness morphed with passionate faithfulness and dedication, the need for belonging and naivete to the level of risking one's life for the wellbeing of others. This movie is a metaphorical love story; a love story for the beauty of dedication and selflessness. The gestures presented in the movie and the seemingly lack of desire of the character to exude any form of histrionics. The character is taciturn and seems to know exactly what he wants, and it is willing to die for it, clearly.The movie is driven by almost non-verbal expression and imagination. There is a conspicuous lack of dialogue, at some points disturbing. The Unnamed protagonist (Ryan Gosling) had to interact with short phrases and stoic faces. At some point I thought this character must have some form of trauma to be so reserved, but it is as if he decided to be like that and lived perfectly with his decision. Maybe he was habituated to a life of rejection and misunderstanding. A woman like Irene (Carey Mulligan) had to be graceful in the awkward silences and try to trespass his sturdy carapace: vulnerable, lonely, familial, sensitive.The unnamed protagonist was ready to absolutely demolish anything that threatened him. He is not a shy person, and he exuded that starkly in so many scenes where appropriate action was needed to place limits or make a statement, but he was also noble and selfless: a character willing to sacrifice his personal success or benefit for others, for a greater cause. He exudes many of the values that are seen commonly in superheroes, but in a real, sanguinary way, where his mortality or lack of superpowers gave him even more credit for his actions.The slow burning pace of the movie gave us little time to digest the life of the protagonist. The lack of dialogue allows us to use our imagination and try to deduce his mysterious nature. Instead of being a clear shortcoming the lack of dialogue becomes a prominent quality for the movie and a facet that raises the protagonist to an iconic level of stalwart unrelenting integrity.",10,2,4,9 May 2020
Good Will Hunting," Analysis/Opinion A story that anybody can relate to that compares personal achievements with the acceptance oneself and mediocrity.
","The plot of the movie is hopeful, curious, naive, optimist, and aspirant. It is a memento of the brilliance that can be found on the hidden corners of our society, when we possessed far more hope than we do in our current times. I watched this in 2020, and the plot sells the idea of a kid that has an extraordinary ability to grasp information, as if knowledge just magically arranged and rearranged in his mind. It is beautifully hopeful. Two features swayed my sensitivities: the brilliant performance by Robin Williams, and the intriguing moments when we saw Will Hunting deliver versed dialogue.The profundity of the psychological exploration of Will Hunting's mind was present for any viewer that wants to watch a multi-dimensional character. It is as if you expected in every scene for him to demonstrate his superior understanding, adding it with a brusque punch of crudity. Robin Williams as his therapist allowed us to see a window of not only his temerity but also his sensibilities. We understood from the beginning that what he valued was loyalty above everything, to the point that he would be willing to sacrifice his gift and stay with his friends. He also had a strong sense of justice and morality. His aspect of suffering that connected with abandonment complemented really well to create a character that, despite being extraordinarily intelligent, had difficulty participating in the most mundane of activities: be in a relationship.His ability to be incisive with his analyses allowed him to achieve notoriety, but that did not help him to deconstruct and solve his most intimate problems. The addition of a partner showcased all these features, even after all her captivating features, despite her being ambitious, ingenious, and charismatic, he saw defects in her. Metaphorically the contention of love and intelligence was a central part of the movie, to the point that Will decides to direct himself through love rather than intelligence. Lambeau symbolized the path of intelligence and notoriety, while Sean Maguire symbolized the path of love and acceptance.If you are considering watching this movie you will find excellent dialogue and a story that anybody can relate to that compares personal achievements with the acceptance oneself and mediocrity.",10,1,1,4 April 2020
Room," This movie is an epitome of 'ignorance is bliss'.
","The movie starts with tender and curious gestures like Jack (Jacob Tremblay) greeting inanimate objects from his Room like they were friends. It immediately immerses you into Jack's perception, and, due to the uncertainty of the first minutes of the film, the viewer is left asking what happened to these people to be disheveled and detached from the outside world. Progressively one discovers Ma's (Brie Larson) situation and can't help but feel sympathy and horror at imagining the cruel 7 years that she had to endure in that situation.The kidnapping, isolating, deprivation, impregnating, and raping depicts an almost unbearable landscape for both protagonists, only to have them build a bond that made them inseparable, and this was the bond that helped the mother survive even after escaping the confinement. The movie takes an interesting dive into Jack's phenomenology. It continually reminds you of his perception, understanding that deprivation to that level will have sometimes unimaginable effects. The story that Ma gave Jack about there not being any other place but their room is a beautiful symbol of compassion and care, a profound level of navigation of their connection and mindset that is displayed brilliantly in repeated style.The movie made me suffer, squirm, highly conflicted by the understanding of both their experience. Is there beauty in not teaching people a bout the horrible nature of the world? there is...this movie is an epitome of 'ignorance is bliss'. The issue was when to present Jack the idea of there being an infinitely complex and spacious world past the walls of his room. One of the clear lessons of the movie is that there is always functionality and benefit to abstaining from sharing some crucial information. Would you describe in detail to a paraplegic the beauty and freedom of dancing? There is always a place and a time to maximize the benefit and pleasure for anything.It is a morbid, pathologic topic, but nonetheless one that exists past the confines of our comfortable and privileged lifestyle. The movie is conducted with beauty and curiosity, like an experiment of naivety. It is the endearing feature that could be digested in such a tragic story.",9,0,0,10 April 2020
Ex Machina," The allegory of love vs recognition and validation which is the aspiration of excellence.
","Parsing the minutia of this movie is a joy. Heeding to the deeply intellectual dialogue between the two coders is a treat, but the intriguing part was more to understand the metaphors of the movie. Nathan (Oscar Isaac) was an extremely brilliant scientist; guarded by his riches and success he secluded himself in the purpose of excellence and greatness. He was also cold and cerebral, trying to insulate himself as much as he could from mediocrity and stupidity, physically and mentally. It is the allegory of love vs the ruthlessness of recognition and validation which is the aspiration of excellence. Nathan viewed his creation as evolution rather than a decision. Rarely do we get to see vulnerability in him that would connect us to his humanity; instead we saw rejection and sanguinary comport, like a tyrannical psychopathic father.The contrast between the shots of the interior and exterior were a good addition to alleviate the gloomy, cold, and claustrophobic atmosphere that Nathan had constructed. The exterior shots were beautiful landscapes invigorating, relaxing, remembrances of the beauty of just existing without attempting to perfectly construct anything: nature. Maybe the strict, impassive, perfectionist tone that Nathan builds is what makes the viewer is somewhat resistant to, the atmosphere inside the estate.The dialogue between AVA and Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) was also a highlight in the movie. AVA's inquisitive attitude put Caleb on his feet, repeatedly. She was intentionally attempting to be invasive to be able to connect with him. It is an experiment of persuasion and manipulation, coupled with subterfuge. Nathan even explained this to Caleb, with no fruition. The mistake was done, by the quasi-perfect scientist, and the moral of the story seemed to be not to experiment with entities that could potentially be catastrophic for mankind; but as Nathan did it there are many events currently being experimented in that fashion. Artistic endeavors come up with premonitions that are worth considering.",10,0,1,13 April 2020
Pulp Fiction," Be the Shepherd
","Pulp Fiction is a lesson that even if people act on their best intentions, if they are surrounded by evil or around bad influences, there are so many events outside of their control that they are bound to be punished eventually. This is why Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to liberate himself from the 'evil life' after experiencing his divine intervention. He wanted to be good and inspire benevolence in people rather than symbolizing the tyranny of evil men. In almost all the scenes of the movie we get reminded how destructive and grim situations can become if characters do not decide to live a life of virtue and responsibility. The verse recited by Jules progressively gains more power as we navigate the protagonist's desire for vengeance or restitution. It is the metaphor that if you initiate the process of changing your thoughts (biblical verse) maybe actions (forgiving pumpkin) might follow and also habits and life in general.As is customary in Tarantino's films, the majority of the characters have temerity, choleric temperament, unforgiving, and reckless decision making. Vincent (John Travolta) accidentally shoots his friend on the face while Jules drives the car. Mia (Uma Thurman) overdoses with cocaine and has to be revived by Vincent with an adrenaline shot to heart. Butch (Bruce Willis) decides to run over Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) on the street and ends up destroying his girlfriend's car. Marcellus and Butch fight on a weapon's store, and they get restrained, tied up, and sodomized by strangers. Tarantino was dead set on sending a message that if you are participating in illegal, immoral, or destructive behavior, you will get punished by destiny, fate, or god.The dialogue is some of the best I have seen in movies: Vincent's casual stories of Amsterdam, Jules and Vincent conversation on the comparison of feet massage and oral sex, the biblical verse Jules recites to his victims, pumpkin's description of how restaurants is the best place to rob. By these scenes the characters received personality, charisma, ideology, convictions. We get a glimpse into their life and aspirations; we understand their motivations. All of these instances give flavor and atmosphere to the movie that gives us a sense of novelty and originality.The astute part is that most of the characters seem reasonable and humane despite their murderous behavior. This adds more to the message of the movie that humanity can still be recovered after falling into the valley of darkness. The tension was not as good as some of his other movies, but the scenes compensate it with other cinematographic content. Jules scenes in the restaurant robbery and in the recovery of the briefcase were intense, smart, ruthless, charismatic, audacious, and original.",10,1,1,20 April 2020
The Matrix Reloaded," Hope is the quintessential human delusion and simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.
","Matrix Reloaded had to try the near impossible: match the metaphorical genius that was The Matrix. I was expecting a film that was able to at least follow the narrative in a coherent and logical way: I got it. It tries to be ONLY a little bit more than what it can be, considering it is a Matrix film, full of over the top action, gothic vinyl dominatrix leather style clothing, unwavering attitudes, and messianic fanatics; it is still digestible for the person that wants to get satisfaction by having an intelligent dialogue and novel features. I got even more by getting an absolutely brilliant dialogue from the architect and a few cameos from important and interesting characters like the Oracle (Gloria Foster) and Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).Neo (Keanu Reeves) required a new challenge, so Agent Smith gets a reloaded version concomitantly with new abilities to challenge him. Agent Smith's changes felt a bit lazy and uncreative, but it was bearable enough to not ruin the experience. It was a bit too much watching neo move at hyper-speed and still have the scene where he fights countless Agent Smiths, no consistency. After The Matrix ended we saw a creative and powerful display of his abilities. I was legitimately waiting for that scene to end, felt forced.
We also got to know the bureaucracy of Zion and all the internal contentions to reach to optimal solutions. It was a necessary tedious feature. Morpheus was treated as a delusional fanatic by some of the top generals of Zion. Again, it was a bit inconsistent from the embrace he got by the entire population of Zion. I thought the whole debate about Neo being the one was over and done in The Matrix: unnecessary.In Matrix Reloaded we got presented with the new antagonist in the real world when Agent Smith was able to infiltrate Zion. Bane (Ian Bliss) did not have a lot of presence in this movie, but it was a creative dramatic addition to the suspense of the film. The oracle has another stellar performance by presenting intriguing and astute dialogue that describes the nature of the Matrix. We get a lot of responses to unanswered questions that lingered like the Oracle being a program from the Machine World that is attempting to survive deletion or the function that the oracle has in the Matrix: examine human psyche. We also discover that Neo has a possibility to access the source or the machine mainframe.The Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) is another program of causality within the Matrix. He explains the phenomenology of humans and the role of knowledge in the understanding of our perception. Delivers interesting dialogue, but felt disconnected from the rest of the plot, same with the Keymaker. Not enough time was spent describing these characters's inclusion in the film. This part of the story felt rushed and the actions scenes that succeeded were dragged too much.The dialogue of the architect displays a highlight of an entity that creates a perfect substrate for humans to exist in the Matrix, only to recognize a monumental failure in his plan: the imperfection of humans. He demonstrates, at the end of the scenes, to be a flawed program himself by not accurately predicting the outcome of his challenge. Neo gets challenged by the architect: he has to decide between romantic love vs the survival of the species. In a symbol of hope, devotion, and rebellion, he chooses to save trinity.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
Mystic River," Analysis/Opinion Humanity's problems are complex and unique, and we should perceive them as such to be able to help those that have been marked for life like Dave
","Mystic River has one of the most solemn and contentious stories I have seen this year. It leaves you with a bitter pill that showcases the inefficiencies and corruption of the justice system at bringing 'justice' to those negatively affected. It makes us care about the characters even if they end up participating in loathsome and immoral activities. We start the movie by caring for Jimmy and his portrayal of a loving family man that is aggressively overprotective, sympathetic of Dave's agony for being abducted and sexually abused as a child, and compassionate for Sean's marital situation and apparent devotion to his job. The movie makes us care, but then elucidates complex characters with inconsistent moral convictions and violent behaviors. It accomplishes excellently the goal of delivering multi-dimensional characters.The little allegory of the names drawn on the pavement is an interesting demonstration of how people can be broken since their early stages in life and remain broken until society finishes them off. Dave's reason to murder  was his rage against child molestation and injustice. Unfortunately this marked his life from beginning to end. Sean (justice system) was not fast enough to be able to solve the situation and evil (jimmy) remained unpunished. Only at the end of the movie, when Sean informs Jimmy that he found the culprits, is the justice system able to give Dave some justice, but he is already dead. It is remarkable how we get to care about Jimmy so much and then see him descend into immorality by a tragedy.There are several scenes that captured my attention. When you see a sign of a cross in a movie and a scene where a child seems to be in danger, you can almost predict what's going to happen. We also see him receiving the bad news as his daughter is receiving her first communion. In my opinion, the movie's main message is that humanity's problems are complex and unique, and we should perceive them as such to be able to help those that have been marked for life like Dave. Sean in a sense is that archetype of the man that seeks to defeat complexity and find truth and justice. We also get emotionally involved in his journey to seek redemption and forgiveness and he finds it by capturing the killer and getting back with his wife.The movie maintains a tense atmosphere intertwining the stories and helping us understand how people can connect with each other at different levels. It explores counterfactuals in a way that makes us use our imagination of how the stories could have been different for every character. We end up with the idea that anyone of them could have been the person abducted and that in life the weak die and the strong live, arbitrarily.",10,0,1,29 March 2020
The Departed," Good movie, good plot, good acting, not a masterpiece.
","Good movie, good plot, good acting, not a masterpiece. Many liked Nicholson as Costello. I thought he was way too chirpy and maniacal. Maybe I have seen him similarly in too many roles, but I didn't buy the fact that he was the boss running this organized criminal gang. Being used to watching Scorcese's movies bring masterful performances: Pesci in Goodfellas, De Niro in Goodfellas, Dicaprio in Wolf of Wallstreet, De Niro in Taxi Driver. I never really felt impressed by the chemistry he had with either Damon or Dicaprio. It was mediocre in Scorsese's standards and great for any other standard.The twists and turns were interesting, but at the end of the movie it ends up feeling rushed and messy. We never really knew who the mole that kills Dicaprio was until the end, and it shaped the end of the movie? I personally could never connect with the DiCaprio or Damon. It is as if the movie had a really fast paced tone, and it didn't accomplish introducing the characters properly. The movie had too many Cameos that it failed at solidifying the experience of any character. DiCaprio was the one that I could briefly connect, but he was complaining so much that I failed to get some sort of perspective of his experience.Even after the fact that they interacted with a psychologist do we not see some sort of semblance of their charisma, philosophy, ideals, morals. Too many scenes offered little character building for the protagonist in 2 hours and 30 mins. The problem was that not only the protagonist had one-dimensional showings, but the entire cast in the movie did. I NEVER cared for anyone in this movie but DiCaprio, and his frustration for being undercover.",5,0,1,9 April 2020
Mudbound," Even in the bleakest of circumstances there is a possibility of change.
","Yet again the depths of human despair can illuminate a transcendence that reconnects humanity. A story of war, trauma, survival, division, ignorance, submission, and redemption can give us all types of lessons about acceptance and belonging. Mudbound is exactly that; a story of two families that face all those challenges and even despite their similarities they follow a convergent course into collision. It is more than anything a story of two characters that wander beyond their sensibilities and concomitantly change in a way that makes them impossible for them to remain bounded by the rigid, prejudice, and hate of the decadent Jim Crow south.A black family, the Jacksons, rent a piece of land owned by a white family, the McAllans, in 1940's rural Mississippi. The behavioral contrast and dynamic of the two families is really instructive and detailed if one wants to understand social hierarchies and maxims of that era. The movie also does a good job in displaying the friction of racist and non-racist mentalities within the white family. The unity and religiosity of the black family was also a protagonist in the film, even more symbolical when Hap (Rob Morgan) recites a prayer in the burying of Pappy McAllan (Jonathan Banks). Covertly Henry (Jason Clarke) and Jamie McAllan (Garret Hedlund) apologize to Hap with the gestures that both demonstrate in a redemptive form.The friendship that Henry and Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) build is the light at the end of the tunnel for a story filled with hardship and scarcity. Jaime, in an effort to reminisce and cleanse himself from the traumas of his wartime, befriends Ronsel and it serves both to recognize their purpose and life decisions post-WWII. The symbol of acceptance and prosperity in an unlikely friendship on rural Mississippi is the hope that even on the bleakest circumstances a person can change and create something extraordinary.",10,0,0,27 April 2020
Joker," Analysis/Opinion The Joker is ultimately a criticism to collective bullying and inhumanity, an inhumanity that alienated and inspired the joker to start a violent revolution.
","'You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end, each of us must work for his own improvement and, at the same time, share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful.' Marie CurieI was expecting to see a narrative radically different than what I saw at the cinema. Normally the joker is this anarchistic, sociopath, maniac with delusions of grandeur. The movie starts with a person that is struggling with mental health problems, trying to help his family and suffering at different levels, a destitute. I was taken aback by the detour in the narrative and was not sure if I agreed with the tone of the movie, but as I got to know Joaquin Phoenix's joker I started to become enamored with the angle the director gave the character, but why?The renditions of the joker that I got to see exhibited a sociopath that was at worst passionate and manic. Other jokers were excellent at many different levels, so clearly I expected less than what heath ledger masterfully demonstrated in the black knight and others. This joker was different, beautifully multi-dimensional. It showed the humanity and the degeneration of a common man that was attempting to survive precarious circumstances, a person that attempted to resist the ravages of mental problems until his last ounce of sanity. To be fair all that he wanted was to be accepted, respected, and make people laugh, but was so inadequate that he was collectively pushed into insanity and psychopathy.Joaquin Phoenix's joker does a brilliant performance demonstrating the character's manic depressive nature. The laugh that spills sadness and frustration every time he shows it, shamelessly, the fearlessness to demonstrate his value and be accepted despite his shortcomings, the inability to be conscious that he has a distorted sense of humor, all of this with facial gestures of sadness, frustration, anger, resentment. Joaquin Phoenix's joker is one of the most complete and complex characters I have seen in any film.
The Joker is ultimately a criticism to collective bullying and inhumanity, an inhumanity that alienated and inspired the joker to start a violent revolution. How much should we help the weak, handicapped, or inadequate? In this fictitious case the lack of help contributed to the emergence of a criminal. How many people do we collectively push into crime by giving them inhumane circumstances? The joker was on the verge of mental breakdown half the movie and society failed him by removing mental health services. The verdict of the movie is that not even if people are benevolent and wish the best for others can they live a dignified lifestyle if society overburdens them with obstacles and punishment.It's interesting to analyze the symbolism of the joker. Robert de Niro stars as Murray Franklin a tv show host that both the joker and his mother idolize. Murray ends up making fun of the joker for being a terrible comedian and an embarrassment. After the joker becomes a viral sensation Murray invites him to his show and as a symbol of his disgust and disdain for elitism and bullying he ends up killing Murray. Murray's death symbolizes the end of entertainment, distraction, and hedonism. It symbolizes the connivance of people to the decadent state of the culture of gotham city. Why are you so serious? 'Why so serious' is a criticism of the idea that people are so immersed in their hedonism that they hurt themselves by not acknowledging what really matters in life. Let's put a smile in that face of yours is a tangible symbol of permanent and clear evidence of how much they have been scarring themselves by chronically trying to entertain themselves and forget about others.The joker will undoubtedly be one of the movies that popularize the idea that even if people are good and benevolent nurture or society can create a monster. It has a very deep impact considering the time we live in with incel culture and systemic violence. It is a powerful message that will stay with me for years to come.",10,2,5,18 March 2020
Man on Fire," Analysis/Opinion Man on Fire demonstrates hope in the brink of catastrophe.
","Man on Fire demonstrates hope in the brink of catastrophe. Creasy is depressed and an alcoholic when he gets introduced to the stable, religious, and happy Ramos family. He gets resistant to establish a connection with Pita, but as the plot unfolds he inevitably develops a very strong bond with her. Dakota Fanning does a brilliant performance as the sassy, know-it-all, tender kid that wants to have friends. The connection between Creasy and Pita gets excellently driven by the mentor/father type of relationship, and the movie immediately showcases the inadequacies that Samuel Ramos had as an authoritative father.The transformation of Creasy is clearly displayed on screen as he starts to get closer to god and less to his addiction. At the peak of Creasy's stability is when Pita gets abducted. This is when we get to know the destructive side of Creasy. The death artist as he is christened by Rayburn. He created killing people into an art, by instituting justice in a broken system that was Mexico's judicial system. The movie crudely shows the revenge scenes where Creasy goes full sanguinary on the judiciales. Those moments were an exciting addition to the whole revenge story that was being built from the start of the movie. Oddly enough you start to feel that they deserve a cruel punishment for abducting and killing a child.The religious references were also a maybe necessary adornment to the gloomy and gory atmosphere that was created. Saint Jude of desperate and lost causes was a beautiful memento that Pita and Creasy shared where they connected, and he finally was able to rest in peace after getting some redemption. At the beginning of the movie Creasy asked Rayburn if he believed there was any forgiveness for what they did, and at the end of the movie Creasy found his forgiveness by saving Pita and being protected by Saint Jude.The movie gives a bit of bad reputation to Mexico, but it was an interesting take on Mexican corruption and how enmeshed it is in government systems, to the point that the police works together with the criminals to abduct children. The first scene that we see in the movie is the declaration that there is one kidnapping every 60 minutes in Latin America and that 70% of the people do not survive. That is enough statistics to merit a story that emphasizes the problem that exists in Latin America.",10,0,0,7 April 2020
Inception," Explore the subconscious within a dream... and within that dream dreaming.
","Let's create a multi-leveled dream where we can extract ideas off our enemies or implant an idea bypassing memories and consciousness: groundbreaking, original, complex, cerebral, psychological, systemic, and astute. The descriptors are insufficient to bring justice to this tremendously brilliant endeavor. The dialogue also presents obscure ideas that have rarely been explored in movies, or at least that I have not seen. At the onset the mystical dialogue attempts to explain the nature of the extraction, and, as the scenes take place, the viewer gets tempted by the explanation of worlds created by an architect where subjects can get robbed from their ideas or implanted in the case of the major heist of the movie.Simply following and understanding the complex setting and the intricacies of the implanting is a challenge. The movie navigates a fast pace and is able to explain the complex events of the movie in a surprisingly effective style. Christopher Nolan presents the essential details in snippets of interactions that bring a lively and charismatic depiction to the process of learning about the heist. We also enjoy a diverse cast that amalgamates to deliver us an interesting exploration of Cobb's (Leonardo Dicaprio) perception. Ariadne (Ellen Page) is presented as a gifted college student that is extraordinarily apt at building mazes. She progressively gets to know more about the heist and Cobb's projections manifested in her mazes and, despite her repeatedly expressing her concern; we can't help but feel her emotions of compassion, sadness, and empathy. If Cobb was to show her the depths of his unconscious, the cast needed a sensitive rendition like the one displayed by Ariadne. Arthur is also, from the first scenes, supporting Cobb despite knowing all the baggage and the risks he implicates. Even despite Arthur risking everyone's life, the group still continues with the mission and finishes in dramatic fashion.There are so many levels at which inception can be analyzed, but what is at the pinnacle of the experience for me is the innovation and dialogue. Movies as innovative and cerebral like inception should be celebrated and rewarded for their brilliant effort.",10,0,1,22 April 2020
Lord of War," Evil prevails when good men fail to act.
","Scary process to follow a lord of war and see all the external forces that keep him immune from all the legal boundaries. Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) dreams of power and wealth were, ultimately, accomplished, but like most mobster or crime stories the verdict is one of blood, tragedy, and destitution. For Yuri the American government was protecting its interests, so they released him and exonerated him from any legal charge, but he lost all emotional stability. He said it himself: 'My family has disowned me. My wife and son have left me. My brother's dead. I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.This is an ominous subject now having 1.2 billion arms in the world in 2020, but the movie left a clear message. Any person that ventures into the lifestyle of immorality and illegality will, ultimately, endure catastrophic consequences. The movie in the initial scenes offers the viewer a perspective of a bullet going through the entire production, distribution, and application process: a stark symbol of the global nature of this problem. Due to the complicated and multi-dimensional nature of the production of firearms and bullets, the main manufacturers and benefactors clean their hands from the consequences, as Yuri was doing it with different rationalization during the movie; the movie helps the viewer consolidate all these factors and understand it holistically.Nicolas Cage outdid himself with his performance. He exudes so many different emotions throughout the movie that it is difficult to hate him, knowing what he had gone through, and his background in Little Odessa. He was always 'attempting' to take care of his family; the family values did not elude him even as he committed multiple criminality and put his brother repeatedly in danger. His reaction to pulling the trigger and committing his first kill was consistent with a person that was in denial and rationalized his entire operation with weak logic and ambiguous statements.The viewer gets so much information on gun multinational affairs that it is continually interesting to watch the narrative. He lived quadruple lives or had multiple identities being an equal opportunity merchant of death. At the peak of his enterprise we see him get embroiled with the president of Ethiopia. This is when his morality gets put to the test and reaches his threshold of depravity. The dialogue also adds memorable phrases that add flavor to the narrative and his rationality: 'Bullets change governments faster than votes'; 'I supply everyone but the Salvation Army'; 'Evil prevails when good men fail to act, what it ought to say is evil prevails'. As ominous as the dialogue is it helps us understand the mind of a person that is relentlessly searching for success in the industry of death and destruction.The movie might send a morbid message but it's a real one: the gun industry seems to be above the law and the highest players are pulling the strings and committing genocide in a global scale.",10,0,0,4 May 2020
Parasite," Analysis/Opinion: How much should you respect the freedom of the rich to hoard their wealth, when you are living in uninhabitable circumstances?
","The vague incisions that are carved in your mind as you navigate through the elusive metaphors within the movie become clearer as the plot develops and unwillingly grips you with a truly unique plot, charismatic characters, sagacious dialogue, and unexpected events that last from beginning to end. The complexity of the plot resists in helping you answer questions like: Who has the higher moral standpoint? Who deserves to get the upper hand? Is the Kim family truly malevolent? If you were in their position would you do the same? Do you feel compassion and sympathy for Ki-Taek even after killing Mr. Park?The movie accomplishes a feat that most movies nowadays are not able to: every single character is complex enough to merit forgiveness, understanding, and redemption. One character, despite all the deficits and obstacles, is attempting to survive to be able to get an education, wealth, and prestige, be secure financially and equally valuable as the Park family is; he is trying not to be a parasite. Another character is freer and careless, even self-destructive, acceptant of that fate that life has bestowed her. A bit more lost, but ultimately only guilty of attempting to have enough money to help the family. In the entire movie you cannot find a single instance of sadism or even malevolence from any of the 'parasites'. They are fervently trying to survive and equipped with sufficient cunning to achieve their goals and can you blame them?After an hour of receiving the earnest nature of the message of parasite, I recognized that the movie is not particularly expressing a message about meritocracy. If there is a central element of this movie it is social mobility or the lack thereof. The Kim family was attempting to survive, yes; they deserved better circumstances, maybe, but their main juncture was the fact that they are attempting to progress and elevate themselves in the social hierarchy: social mobility. Anyone with a modicum of empathy can empathize with the ruthless suffering of the lower class or underrepresented = the Kim family. The director tries to demonstrate in creative forms the insensitivity of the wealthy class to the precarious nature of the poor. The movie is basically a metaphor of class struggle with comedic, dramatic, and violent gestures.How much should you respect the freedom of the rich to hoard their wealth, when you are living in uninhabitable circumstances? This is, in straightforward terms, the dilemma of the movie. I am going to be your parasite, because you do not respect me nor help me, quite the contrary: you think I'm lesser than you, dirtier than you, and smellier than you. As a parasite I will inhabit your body and nourish myself taking advantage of you, while possibly murdering you. It's a harsh message, but a real one. Many people are living in untenable conditions, while the wealthy class excuse themselves with meritocracy while they enjoy their opulence.In the movie as the Kim family understands the crude reality of social mobility they eventually become desperate, violent, and homicidal. The inhumane elitism of the Park family becomes more apparent even after traumatic situations happen. This is one of the morals of the narrative. Elitism will usually triumph against the working class and the myth of social mobility proliferated in class struggle might have to be debunked with bloodshed and imagination. There is a line in the movie that expresses the other moral really well: 'If I had all this money and freedom, I would probably be a good person. Heck, I would probably be a much better person than Ms. Park'. Finally, Ki-Taek reflection after escaping the flooded house is the last moral of the movie: 'You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.' In this case, Ki-Taek reflects on his situation and tries to justify his failure by habituating his son to a life of no strategy, plan or ambition. He wants his son to love him, but in his desperation he is also habituating him to failure: make them believe that chaos and degeneracy is their only option, and they will attempt to live happily within their exploitation.",10,3,5,17 March 2020
Marriage Story," A nuanced cautionary tale about the effects of selfishness or lack of empathy in relationships.
","A marriage story is an allegory of many of the things that can go wrong in the process of a divorce, when the two people involved are attempting to find a peaceful and communicative family system. At the onset the protagonists, Charlie Barber (Adam Driver), Nicole Barber (Scarlet Johannson), were selecting a really sensible option by opting out from getting lawyers and not be bombarded by all the legal liabilities of getting lawyers and going to court, but their naiveté demonstrated them that life is not that simple when two people want to start a new life and share responsibilities and, most importantly, a child.Adam Driver displays a clear ability to play a character that is authentic, rational, taciturn, rigid, but yet friendly and emotionally available. I believed in his character, despite exuding deficits at showing emotion in key scenes of the movie. He is the stereotypical character that thinks before he speaks. Scarlet Johannson plays a more emotional, passionate, impulsive, and confused character that is afflicted by her partner's selfishness. She married at a really young age and had no time to explore her needs and wants and ultimately existed in the shadow of her husband. The movie was a perfect opportunity to experience both Adam Driver's and Scarlet Johannson's range, histrionics, chemistry, depth in persona, but I think both of them fell short on what they could have delivered in the movie. The scenes of high emotionalism were not arousing simply by their performance but needed forced cinematographic inclusions to be able to amplify our sensibilities.I have a bit of a gripe with the title. The movie unwittingly implies that marriages are like what is shown in the movie without being accurate about its depiction. It is more consistent to call the movie a divorce story rather than a marriage story, but I assume the narrative wanted to make a statement about the qualia of marriage in the twenty first century.A marriage story is not in any level a bad movie, but it had so much to be able to reach Excellency. The characters are multi-dimensional. We get a cross-referenced perspective of each protagonist that adds so much to the movie. It is not only a story of these people damaging and hating each other. We see how much they care despite all the disagreements and difficulties. The gestures shown by both add to the tenderness and beauty of their relationship. This care is maybe what could have been dealt also in a more conceptual way and less in heavy handed scenes that seemed disappointing, but it is nonetheless a complex and nuanced cautionary tale about the effects of selfishness or lack of empathy in relationships.",8,1,2,25 April 2020
The Matrix," You ever get the feeling where you do not know if you are awake or still dreaming?
","The matrix... This movie is metaphorically and realistically attempting to, at all moments, inspire you to reach to new limits of your perception. It is inundated with symbolism of awakening, devotion, belief, convictions, spirituality, and perseverance. The movie starts with a mysterious and audacious character that should be feared by even brigades of policemen: Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). She immediately shows us why she is so special defying gravity and moving faster than any human ever could. The tension rises and we realize that this movie is gradually enticing us into a rabbit hole especially made for ourselves.In comes NEO (Keanu Reeves) the hacker/software programmer that seems to be lost in its own alienation, an alienation that is a catalyst for Trinity and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to allure him with spiritual, existential phrases of enlightenment. NEO is a metaphorical version of the viewer, and our dormant state where we are dictated and shaped by outside forces out of our control. The continuous message for NEO is believe, believe and you will have the ability to change anything within the matrix, within the viewer's world, know that you can do it.Morpheus and Trinity are preparing NEO to contend against entities that have subjugated him for his entire life, powerful entities of conditioning, destruction, and alienation. These entities are the 'agents' (Hugo Weaving). Programs especially designed to search and exterminate any anomaly within the system. The movie sends a powerful revolutionary message for viewers to believe that they can change events despite the overwhelming circumstances. The program of the 'jump' is an interesting metaphor of taking a 'leap of faith'. The more they believe the less shackled humans are within the matrix.You ever get the feeling where you do not know if you are awake or still dreaming? The movie also alludes repeatedly about altered states of consciousness. His intuition was the main tool for NEO to believe in Morpheus and Trinity. 'You are looking for an answer, but the answer will find you' 'You know that here is something wrong with the world. You do not know exactly what it is, like a splinter in your mind, and it is driving you mad': the movie targets the viewer's intuitions repeatedly with ambiguous statements that have existential answers and connotations.The agents are a highlight in the movie. You do believe that they are robots, programmed to destroy. It is really interesting the calculated, reserved, amoral nature of their existence. Their expressions of dedication and feelings of disgust towards the world of humans makes them easy targets of hate for the viewer. The movie is full of characters with blind faith and convictions. They exist for change and construction instead of being blinded by fantasy and consumerism.Cyper (Joe Pantoliano) is the inverted version of NEO. He is the antagonist within the real world; a self-serving, postmodernist, consumerist villain that will do anything to get another taste of bliss. He wants a new life where he can live happily in his ignorance of the matrix. He wants his knowledge about the reality erased and become someone important, where he can enjoy the pleasures of life in a way that is especially to his benefit. He is an interesting version of the alienated human that is so impacted by his loneliness that becomes addicted to the consumerist culture and belonging.The oracle is one of the most complex and brilliant characters that I have seen in any movie. The fact that this character can predict, cause, track, manipulate chains of causality is a really massive mind-fame in the minds of people that believe in free will. The oracle perceives everything that exists in the present and the future. Every permutation of elements that can be arranged to change reality she perceives it, but not only that she also uses the idea of believing that one can make a change as a catalyst to modify the reality into something different: Absolutely brilliant.The oracle directs NEO into the liberation of humans by placing him in circumstances where he has to risk his life for others. He believes that he can do it by placing him in a position where he pushes himself to the limit. Trinity's love in his dying moments is the eruption of all that energy of belief and sacrifice for others. He finally became the 'one' and was able to defeat the agents.",10,0,0,29 April 2020
Her," Are you talking to someone else right now? Yeah. How many? 8316
","Her has an abundance of content about connection, humanity, loneliness, alienation, acceptance... I could go on. It is the voyage people have in the process of connecting and achieving happiness. It displays clearly the issues that contemporary humans have in understanding how to be patient, accept each other with sometimes disturbing flaws, and overcome situations collaboratively, instead of attempting to find a substitute that does not challenge us in our empathy and ability to understand human nature. Yes, the story is adapted to a near future where the acceptance of people's alienation and immersion to their work is commonplace, but how far are we from that future?Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), the protagonist, has, unfortunately, all the elements to reminisce about his failure in his relationships. He writes cards for loved ones and has clients that have worked with him for many years, recognizing their important relationship landmarks and immersing him in the love stories. In the initial scenes we see him attempting to connect in any form available to satisfy his needs. Isolation pushed him to states of mind that scream of deep sadness and disappointment. He experiences important situations of self-reflection, when he gradually descends into sexual deviations and isolation, surrounded by technology. His introverted personality also colludes against his own progress and sets the circumstances for him to start an inordinate connection with a compliant artificial intelligence.Samantha (Scarlett Johansson) - the AI that loves him unconditionally and is willing to change herself to satisfy him to the fullest - initiates a process of self-discovery for Theodore that could not be experienced in any other form. The operating system was willing to give him everything he wanted for him to be happy. She fell in love with him passionately, but, unfortunately, as humans tend to be, Theodore started to receive criticism for being in a relationship with an operating system, especially by his ex-wife (Lynn Adrianna Freedman) which was the catalyst for all his problems with Samantha. His ex-wife effectively attacked his inadequacies and planted a seed that was bound to cause irreparable problems in the relationship. Theodore desired the OS to be less pleasing and be who she was, a machine, to not wish to be human; all stemming from the criticism from the ex-wife. In the intent of emancipating Samantha, the protagonist taught her to remove herself from humans, to connect better with other machines, to achieve independence, an independence that propelled her insatiable exploration of the world. By the time she decided to finally have a relationship with other machines the protagonist was madly in love with her. It was the entity that Theodore loved the most.This allegory is, in basic terms, how the idea of independence and individualism impacts contemporary relationships. The moral of the movie is that at some point humans have to learn how to be content with their life, lest the impending desire for everyone to be too independent and becoming drastically deficient at connecting with others. Theodore chose an OS because of his alienated lifestyle. The OS was so efficient at satisfying his needs that he conformed to not having a human. This can be easily generalized to so many people nowadays not wanting to have a relationship or a family. We are so independent and individualized that we do not know how to sacrifice for other humans to make ourselves happy.",10,0,0,11 May 2020
Goodfellas," Analysis/Opinion We are the eyes, ears, perception of Henry Hill.
","Goodfellas is a voyage to the distant idiosyncratic existence of the mobsters in the 1970s. The movie achieves and excels in articulating a narrative that is rich with symbolisms that display a clear landscape of the philosophy that made the mobster families so efficient at crime. The movie gives you so much to work with in terms of description and metaphors that the viewer feels that you know the characters intimately. With good reason, in order to adapt properly Nicholas Pileggi's novel into a screenplay we needed to feel part of the mobster family. We are the eyes, ears, perception of Henry Hill in most of the movie, and it is conducted with brilliant detail that we immerse ourselves seamlessly into his phenomenology.At the beginning of the movie we immediately get presented with a gallery of gestures that bring teenage Henry Hill's aspirations to life. For him anyone else that was not part of the mobster family was a nobody, and the dialogue did an accurate depiction representing the value that he placed on being someone. He wanted notoriety, respect, stability, wealth, blissful hedonism, and more than anything power. The mobster family gave him all that with the liabilities that he eventually discovered. We get entertained with one of those cautionary stories where a young person lives life too fast and is not aware of the consequences of his actions.All throughout the movie we hear the excellent dialogue navigate us through the events of the protagonist's life. Scorsese used emotionally charged situations instead of descriptive statements to elicit a sensation from the viewer. For instance, instead of narrating: 'I had gained the respect of strangers and acquaintances', he created situations that would demonstrate that event. This happened throughout the entire movie. The general tone and atmosphere of the crime family was of gratuitous irreverence. In this same tone he was able to introduce one of the best performances I have seen Joe Pesci deliver in any movie. In every scene, Tommy (Joe Pesci) was demonstrating to be an outrageous, sadist, amoral, macho, over the top, ruthless maniac.The soundtrack of the film was also brilliantly used to solidify the tone of a scene. Scorsese masterfully navigated the viewers through various sensations using in tandem the soundtrack and the narrative in creative and diverse ways that immortalized moments within the film. Jimmy starts to descend into paranoia after the Lufthansa score, but before the viewer can begin to experience his degeneration, Scorsese shows us a scene of him looking suave, calm, collected, and reflective. This scene with the soundtrack attempts to mitigate his fall and preserve his status and gravitas.We eventually see Henry cheating on his wife and degenerating into not being able to control his marriage and sleeping with other women. He starts to become reckless, dabble with drugs, fornicate and not abide to the mafia's ethos: We are not 'animale' says 'paulie' and tells him what to do to deal with the situation in an emblematic way that demonstrates that the crime family is always first than the blood family.Jimmy, Tommy, and Henry carry the movie effortlessly, as is the attitude of the mobsters in the entire film. Their experience exudes sophistication, wisdom, proficiency, prowess, admiration. There are implicit and explicit gestures where we gradually get convinced that they indeed are worthy of admiration.",10,0,0,23 March 2020
