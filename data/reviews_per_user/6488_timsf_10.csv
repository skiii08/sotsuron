Requiem for a Dream," Forgettable - spoilers
","Hey look, there's a heroin addict having a good time. Hey look, there's his mom trying to lose weight so she takes speed. Hey look there's the mom grinding her teeth. Hey look, there's the heroin addict buying more heroin on the street. Hey look there's the mom who's starting to freak out. Hey look, there's the heroin addict's girlfriend yelling at him because he doesn't have any heroin. Hey look there's the mom looking really delusional. Hey look there's the mom getting electro-shock therapy (ridiculous). Hey look there's the heroin addict getting his arm chopped off (again, ridiculous).On the other hand, the filming was interesting. Nevertheless, Drugstore Cowboy is the definitive drug film of my generation.",Null,0,0,29 November 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Jaw dropping in every way
","I've been hooked on this film for the past few months. This film is one of the most technically adept films I remember seeing. There are so many 'angles' to experience the film from that I have watched it several times recently and have learned something new each time.The director's commentary DVD lends a lot of insight. The music is exceptional.Darren Aronofsky and the other people who made Requiem have made a true work of art to our society. Every scene is so well crafted that, to change any of them in even a minor way, would alter the movie in a big way.Essential for a film library. (5 out of 5 stars)",Null,0,1,4 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best cartoon.
","The cartoons were very realistic. I was waiting for Pokemon to come out and fly little Anakin away. But he didn't.More than just a cartoon, however, 'real people' were superimposed in a background of cartooney never-never land.Reminiscent of the sets from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but with a high-tech twist, and set in a galaxy far, far away, 'Star Wars, Episode I' offers the viewer enough 'down time' to contemplate which Jujy Fruit to pop in the mouth next.For sociologists, S.W.E.1. offers a definitive study of how many suckers you can fit into a movie theater at one time.",Null,0,1,4 June 2000
Cast Away," Except for the island parts, a good film (spoilers)
","In a nutshell: Hanks' FedEx plane crashes somewhere in the ocean. Everyone dies except him. He wakes up on an island, and survives 4 years by learning to make fire and catch fish/crab. Then he constructs a boat and sails back to civilization.Sound familiar...perhaps like the preview you've seen on TV? Well, that's about as in-depth as it gets here.'Cast Away' spends WAY too MUCH time showcasing Hanks' acting talent on the island, and WAY too LITTLE time with the effect that his return has on the people in his life...about 3/4 of the movie involves Hanks' stranded island experience, while ONLY 1/4 involves Cast Away's character development and post-rescue reactions. It's that 1/4 that Zemeckis is brilliant at! Zemeckis and the people who work with him are incredibly gifted people who can put a movie together like Forrest Gump or Contact...movies that echo with human warmth long after you watch them.Why is the film FULL of island living, and therefore DEVOID of humanity? I mean, I know the film is about a cast away who lives outside humanity, but why does the movie have to be SO FAR removed from the human element that IS Zemeckis' talent?Anybody out there who knows what I'm talking about? Most of the comments to this film are enthusiastically, ravingly, jaw-droppingly appreciative. 'Ooh, Tom Hanks was so good! <sniff>' Given this year's vapid selection of quality movies, I guess I'm not surprised.On the other hand, the one island element that I think is noteworthy is Wilson, the soccer ball.",Null,0,0,29 December 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Action scenes with little plot
","Ok, there is this movie called Terminator 3, but the only thing that resembles anything related to the Terminator franchise here is Arnold and, unfortunately, he alone doesn't convince me that this is the Terminator.T3 is a not-bad summer action film, full of action and adventure, but not much in the way of a plot. I read a comment on imdb that says that the ending alone is worth the price of admission; that reviewer is apparently very easily amused.Throughout the film, which does have some interesting action sequences, there was a noticeable lack of depth. T3 almost seemed like it was developed 'by committee' with little bits that had a certain feel, and other bits that had another feel.Kristanna Loken, who played the T-X, was fine as an actress. She performed her role well. But, what is the point of getting a supermodel to play John Connor's killer? Her beauty had nothing (at least not revealed in the film) to do with the role of the T-X, and there was no reason not to use a more sinister character. Casting her degraded the film to less-than-science-fiction, because good science fiction films avoid such fluff. Based on T3, I could see Kurt Russell, Steven Segal and maybe Jackie Chan getting involved in T4, almost to the point of slapstickT3 actually hinted that the 'plot' was about to go somewhere, when the T-X began programming machines to help her. This was where it was getting interesting, and it happened pretty early on in the film. I could see where the 'Rise of the Machines' subtitle was being utilized. Then it totally fell flat, with virtually no mention of the rise of any machines, except little bits that were touched on here and there, and that which was implied at the end of the film.The special effects and action scenes were technically good, but my policy is that good special effects, by themselves, are useless.Overall, the film is somewhat interesting, with a light plot and strong action sequences, although in the end it seems as if I was ripped off with hardly any payoff. Certainly not along the lines of T2 (James Cameron), which is one of the best films to ever come out of Hollywood, and one that I've seen dozens of times. T3 had none of that.",Null,0,0,7 July 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Sci-Fi in its truest form
","Not many films can describe the melancholy, brooding, metallic Sci-Fi futuristic sentiment that T2 does in virtually every scene. The opening L.A. highway scene (along with its slow, sinister music) is a brilliant signature that instantly and accurately sets the tone for this picture. Cameron teams up with the best people in the industry. 10 years later T2 is still in my ranking as 'one of' the best films made. Truly a masterpiece.",Null,1,1,24 July 2000
Men in Black II," What a yawn
","Couldn't watch for more than 5 minutes. Boring.The first Men In Black was incredibly engaging from the instant the music began through the end. This one sucked with that stupid opening sequence with Peter Graves with 'supposed-to-be-bad-special-effects' that were NOT funny, just lame.Early on in the movie Patrick Warburton grabs something that looks like a dandelion from a city sewer grate, which turns out to be a piece of a huge alien that becomes angry at Warburton's grab. The monster jumps out of the sewer and chomps on Warburton.In the first film the MIB were always careful not to let the public see aliens. If an alien was spotted, they had to bring in their 'containment' crew to undo the PR damage. Here, they simply don't care who sees it.Typically sloppy for a Hollywood sequel to simply disregard all the elements that made it a good story in the first place.One good thing about this movie. Now I know to avoid Barry Sonnenfeld films. For a while after I saw Men In Black I actually thought he was a good director. Although I never got suckered into Wild Wild West (never appealed to me at all). Another good thing. I was able to get a refund for this film after the first 5 minutes and got to see another film.",Null,0,0,20 July 2002
Black Hawk Down," Bland
","Somewhat spoiler.Technically interesting but not that much more. I didn't stay past the halfway point. After the 2nd helicopter went down, I decided it was time to get on with my day.The film consisted of a lot of fighting in Somalia but I simply do not understand why this film is receiving so much hype.",Null,0,0,26 January 2002
Titanic," Didn't see it in the theater :(
","If you think you're a film buff but you're really film-illiterate, you will hate Titanic.I avoided seeing this 'movie' in the theater because the studio played it up as a sappy love story.WHY OH WHY DID THEY PLAY IT UP LIKE THAT?!!?It didn't matter that James Cameron, who is a genius, directed it. I HATE love stories and I still haven't seen The English Patient.Titanic (which, by the way, is not a 'love story' as it was portrayed in promotional materials) reveals itself to be much more than just the surface subject matter that is written and portrayed. Many people who have commented on it already have mentioned why, so I will not try to explain why Titanic is one of the best films made, which would require a novel-length volume of words.",Null,1,3,21 July 2000
True Romance," Appeals to a knowlegeable audience
","Tarantino's script for this film is very mature...its best viewer is a viewer who watches a lot of movies.Many of the scenes are striking not only for their plainly-observable actions, but also for the method by which the scenes are played out.IMO, it is difficult to write a movie script that talks about movies, yet Tarantino expertly weaves in and out of characters, drama and violence as though he his stitching his own kickass boxing gloves for a brawl out West.True Romance consists of scenes that stand firmly on their own ground. You could pluck a scene from True Romance and show it as its own clip and the viewer might walk away slightly dazed but with a lucid point of view.For example:-The Dennis Hopper & Christopher Walken scene-When Alabama kills that guy-All of the Drexl scenes-All of the Lee Doniwitz scenesNevertheless, True Romance is packed with interesting characters that offer cohesion - - more so than just by good actors reading good lines. The actors seem to be knowledgeable that they are part of something great, and their performances, spoken words and subtleties reflect that greater knowledge.Not for the timid, True Romance may influence your movie theater candy-stand decision on whether you should purchase the Gummi Bears, or whether to go full throttle and get the all-beef frank.",Null,0,3,9 June 2000
