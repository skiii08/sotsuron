The Hangover," Terrible. Boring.
","I've never actually written a review on IMDb before. After seeing the ridiculous ratings this movie received, I had to make an account. I enjoyed movies like Super Bad and Wedding Crashers, so I thought this couldn't be much different(plus everyone's been so hyped up about it). IT'S CRAP. Almost all the jokes are lame and fall flat throughout the whole movie. I maybe smiled/laughed twice? It makes me think that people who rated it highly must have been so drunk or f*cked up when they watched it. The actors suck. It all seems so forced that it's embarrassing. The type of scenario in this movie has been so over done. I'm bored of it.",1,6,13,10 January 2010
