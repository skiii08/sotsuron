Hereditary," Everything I ever wanted in a horrormovie
","It's just....amazing. I didn't sleep well for three days after watching this.
Ari Aster really created a genre of it's own.
It takes the viewer seriously and gives you a psychological drama drenched in the most awful and dark horrors you could imagine.",10,2,3,23 February 2020
Midsommar," Ready for a WTF?! moment that lasts two and a half hours?
","Ari Aster gives us this expertly played out nightmarish dream of a drama. Pregnant with ancient symbolism Florence Pugh goes through a catharsis after a deep personal crisis.
There is no comparison to the oeuvre of Ari Aster. It deepens the horror genre in a very exciting way. It takes my intelligence seriously and does it's best to touch me emotionally. And it succeeds!",9,3,5,23 February 2020
