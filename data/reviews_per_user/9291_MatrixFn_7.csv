The Blair Witch Project," Jerks ruin the movie!
","I have to admit, I did not enjoy The Blair Witch Project when I saw it last night.  It wasn't because it was a bad movie though, it was because several jerks in the theater were making dumb-ass comments throughout.The Blair Witch Project is a movie that is based on mood, atmosphere, and suggestion.  When someone is sitting by you making stupid comments, this is ruined.A think there are two groups of people who have been bashing this movie, the teenagers who were looking for a gory, dead bodies everywhere, special effect laden, scare fest, and the people who might actually enjoy the movie if it wasn't for the first group ruining it.  Please, if you might be in the first group, either don't go or sit there quietly, because some of us actually want to enjoy the movie for what it is a suggestive work based on atmosphere and mood!I suggest that if you want to see the movie, you either wait until the crowds go down or go at twi-light when few other people are there.  This way you will be able to enjoy the movie fully.I went ahead and gave this movie a 9/10, something I rarely do (I try to keep my average vote around 5), because I could tell it was a very good movie, even with the jerks talking through the whole thing.",8,1,3,12 August 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Very Good but...
","Dr. Strangelove is a really good movie, but I don't feel that it deserves to be #9 all-time (its rank as of this writing).  My main problem with it is the ending.  I felt that the movie should have ended when the first bomb hit.  If Kubrick wanted to include the dialogue which followed, he should have but it before the bomb landed.The other thing I want to point out is that General Ripper's theory about floridated water is not as creative as it seems today.  The belief that floridation was a communist plot was a real and fairly wide-spread belief during the 50s.Overall Dr. Strangelove is quite good, a certaintly a classic.  I just don't feel it should be #9 all-time.  Rating: 8/10",7,0,2,1 November 1999
American Beauty," A very good movie, but...
","American Beauty is a very good movie.  However, it does not deserve to be ranked #1 all time as it currently is.  There is really no need to repeat what everyone is saying (i.e. that the film is great, has great acting etc.), so I'll just add one comment which most people have overlooked...The reason American Beauty is such a great film is because of the incredible precision of the dialogue.  Every line is so crisp & fresh; it is quite amazing.",9,0,0,19 October 1999
The Green Mile," Best movie of the year and, perhaps, all-time
","Green Mile is the BEST movie of 1999.  It is absolute perfection on the screen.Frank Darabont does an incredible job.  Normally, such a 3 film tends to drag along, but not so with Green Mile.  There is plenty going on at all times.  In fact, the story would be hurt if the film was cut even 5 minutes. I salute the director, producer, and film company for being daring enough to release the film in its entirety, a move that likely cost it some box office dollars (many people are not willing to sit through such a long movie, plus the length limits the number of showings a day).Tom Hanks and Michael Duncan are brilliant.  There performances are second to done.  All other parts are well-played, as well.The plot, screen play, and dialogue are perfection.  I can not imagine a better story, told more perfectly.Green Mile envokes deep & true emotion in the viewer.  Never before have I felt so involved a the movie.  I truly felt the pain and joy of the characters.When I saw American Beauty, I though there was no way it would be topped this year, but I was wrong.  Green Mile is far better than American Beauty and deserves to win best picture.  American Beauty is a truly great picture, but Green Mile is simply better.  Green Mile is the best of the best and should help nail 1999's mark in movie history as one of the best years for movie making ever.In conclusion, Green Mile is perfection on the screen, the best movie of the year, and perhaps the best ever.  I give it a perfect 10, an honor which I have only ever given 1 movie before.",10,0,1,17 January 2000
The Iron Giant," A good movie with one significant flaw
","The Iron Giant is a good movie, but falls short of great due to the ending.The movie shows the destructive nature of fear and hate in a compelling fashion.  It is also funny. The ending is quite beautiful, at first, as our hero sacrifices himself for the good of humanity.  Unfortunately, he is brought back to life to please the kids the film is aimed at.7.5/10",8,0,0,19 March 2000
Tarzan," Quite possibly the best Disney cartoon ever
","Tarzan is quite possibly the best Disney Cartoon ever.  Now that is saying a lot!Designed for children? Perhaps, but there is plenty in the movie for adults as well.The casting is excellent, as the voices really match the characters personalities.  The story flows very well form one scene to the next. There is enough going on to keep the viewer interested throughout.  In Tarzan, Disney avoids their tendency to over play the 'musical scenes.'The real beauty of the film comes in the strong emotion it captures.  The film really draws the viewer in.  One feels Tarzan's struggles to be accepted.  The turns the movie takes makes the viewer sad, then mad, and at last high again.I rate Tarzan as the 3rd best movie of 1999 (so far), behind The Matrix and and just behind October Sky.",8,1,2,22 September 1999
Princess Mononoke," Not all its cracked up to be
","'Go and see this movie. You won't be disappointed'I was disappointed.  While certainly a well-animated and relatively unique picture, Mononoke Hime is far from a great picture.It suffers from too major problems: Corny dialogue and pointless elements. While the first might be do to poor translation, the second surely is not. Ideas are introduced but not developed several times.  Other apparent plot elements disappear without explanation, never to return again. 
Yes, there are much better animated pictures out there.  Antz, for example, has many significant advantages over Mononoke Hime.",5,6,16,19 March 2000
