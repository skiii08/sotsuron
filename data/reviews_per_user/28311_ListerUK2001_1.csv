Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Clearly not intended to entertain anyone above six
","I know it must have been hard to cope with the pressure of following the legendary previous Star Wars films, but I think Georgie could have at least have attempted to make the film indurable to an adult audience. The first three films were all classified as Universal for family viewing, yet it neatly avoided talking down to its audience. The Phantom Menace is like a Diseney version of Star Wars with so much animation on screen as to make it impossible to allow it to be escapism for anyone over the age of six. Cartoon effects are not impressive compared to the model work of the first three. However, I hasten to add, there is still a lot in the film worth watching. The light-saber battles are outstanding.",Null,0,1,16 September 2001
