Child 44," Unexpectedly unprofessional, unrealistic piece of 'work'
","Unusual style and color for military uniforms... not even close to be logical, and abnormal activity for the soldiers who were fighting four long years at WWII. Absolutely strange notions about the Russian mentality may have arisen because filming took place anywhere but not in Russia, but not anybody Russian, without the slightest notion of time referred to in the film. Good science for the future, and very expensive lesson for producers. All together this doesn't sound like $50 mil movie - for that money this got to be much much better. Awful is the word to characterize this surrogate movie - not recommending for watching by anyone",1,67,157,15 April 2015
