3:10 to Yuma," mute your mind and you gonna be alright
","Acting - great
Characters - thumbs up (though they're weird, but hey, who isn't)
Beautiful to watch (you know, the visuals like costumes, nature, little towns, etc.)
Quite entertaining (only if you can shut the logical part of your brain for a while)
Making you ask yourself 'why did/didn't he do that, why did he waste this opportunity' and so on
Some ridiculous heroism. Some psychopathy
To sum up, it's a mindless, logic-free entertainment. If you're looking for something to relax and just watch without searching for meaning and if you can keep yourself from solving mysteries of logic, go ahead and watch this",6,0,2,4 February 2020
