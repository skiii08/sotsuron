Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Such high expectations, such low outcome...
","Being a huge fan of QT before the Kill Bill series, I was ecstatic when I heard that QT was making another film. I watched Kill Bill Vol 1, didn't love it, the only reason that kept myself from hating was Uma. Then, I gave Vol. 2 a shot, not the best. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was Bill, and the last parts of dialogue between Bill and Kiddo. I felt the cast wasn't well chosen, the action scenes were mediocre, and the dialogue was decent. My ratings for previous QT films were: Reservoir Dogs (10/10), Pulp Fiction (10/10), Jackie Brown (8/10). My ratings for these two films: Vol 1 (3/10), Vol 2 (4/10) A Huge Disappointment.",9,4,8,21 May 2006
United 93," A Film Well Worth the Wait.
","Finally! A film pulling apart the tragedy of 9/11.I'll promise everyone that there will be films to come about 9/11 trying to overachieve Unite 93, and they will fail miserably.This film is quite impressive considering the obstacles the film had to take to make it. Such obstacles as new actors and actresses to Hollywood, the controversy of what had happened in the plane itself, etc.I was truly moved from this film, the acting was good, the story was good, the movie was good.B+ 9/10",9,3,7,30 April 2006
Casino," Scorsese strikes again with this must-see classic.
","Martin Scorsese strikes again with this raunchy classic about the Italian mob taking over the city of Las Vegas. De Niro excels as he plays 'Ace' Rothstein, a classy business man, who throughout the movie gains success and popularity which soon leads to his downfall. Pesci plays tough guy Nicky Santoro, who has more of an old fashion way of solving problems, but none the less, gains power and succeeds throughout this film. Sharon Stone was a flawless gem in this film. Sharon stole every scene if it was with her laughing, crying, sobbing or living it up. Casino is the most enjoyable film on the 90's, a must-see classic.",10,8,11,27 February 2006
