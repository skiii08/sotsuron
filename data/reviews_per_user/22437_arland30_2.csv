Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," So much wrong, but still overlooked
","I will admit, there is so much wrong with this movie, and I was as disappointed with it as anybody else, but most people hate this movie for the wrong reasons. I'll get my problems out of the way, they're nothing everybody else hasn't already said. Of course I hate jar jar, midiclorions, and Darth Maul's going out like a bitch, and there is some horrible CGI in this movie. But, other than the animal stampede and some of the explosions, the CG is pretty damn good for 1999.Now, Jake Loyd did a good job. The kids 9 years old! Don't put the failure of a movie on his shoulders. He had big shoes to fill, and I believe nobody could've done any better or worse than he did.Now, if you have any problem with this review, I'll leave you with this: Phantom Menace was still a hell of a lot better than Attack of the Clones",7,2,5,27 December 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," CGI and Disappointment
","Whats happened to Peter Jackson and WETA since Return of the King? It's been about 10 years since the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it seems like they've gotten worse at their jobs. The special effects are awful, the story changes are ludicrous, and the action is so fake it can't even be classified as cool or epic. All these things were evident in the first two, but were turned up to 11 in this one. It starts off with Smaug being killed in the must unbelievable way possible, making Bard king for the idiots of lake town, and the dwarfs get the mountain back. 16 minutes in, and I was asleep. Thorin is going insane, which the rest of the dwarfs should be doing if it's the gold causing it, and is being a complete dick to his friends, while the greedy elves and men are asking for their share of the treasure. And meanwhile, the Orcs want revenge. This is all being filmed on a green screen, mind you, and conjured up in a computer, and it looks like a 2nd grader did it. Not much happens between then and the climax. I mean, there's some stuff going on with Legolas, and then there's Gandalf's side story, but all of that is so badly done and full of continuity and bad effects and added storytelling that wasn't in the book... That it feels so idiotic and money grubbing to watch. The climax is just unwatchable. We've got potty mouthed dwarfs, CG soldiers who all look the same, magic Rams that appear out of nowhere, a really stupid death for Thorin, Gandalf making stupid noises with his pipe, giant worms that appear out of nowhere and are never seen again, gravity and physics defying CG stunts, fart jokes, boob jokes, a stupid Monty Python reference... And me asking for my money back.",1,5,9,27 December 2015
