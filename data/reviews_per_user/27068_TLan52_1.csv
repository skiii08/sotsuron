Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Classic Tarantino
","I have seen every one of Tarantino's movies and I would argue that Vol. 2 fits right in with each of his pictures. The fact is his directing style is versatile and unique. Despite that, the thing that I love about Tarantino is that each of his films are supremely watchable. Think about anyone else trying to explain the premise for Kill Bill to a studio manager. White girl from a team of international assassins wakes from 4 year coma to seek revenge. It sounds crazy but like every other Tarantino movie, he makes it so enjoyable and intriguing. Every shot is important and exciting. I really can't say enough about this man as a director and Kill Bill Vol. 2 is not a let down.9.2/10",Null,0,1,19 August 2004
