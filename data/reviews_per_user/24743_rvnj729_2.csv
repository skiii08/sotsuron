Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Possibly my favorite Star Wars film, easily of the three prequels.
","I hate all the criticism that Episode I gets from all directions. The characters aren't developed supposedly (even though I found no such problem), because it's EPISODE I! This is introducing us to the whole universe technically! What, do you expect there to be a 15 minute short film before this explaining who Qui-Gon exactly is, Obi-Wan, the Trade Federation, etc. This film is more political than the original trilogy because, even though they are great films 4, 5, and 6, they are not with the exception of 5 in my opinion, as adult as this one. People complain about the plot, but its actually fairly simple. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to protect the Queen of Naboo because the trade federation who is working with the Sith are trying to kill her. Along the way on Tatooine, they find Anakin Skywalker and free him. Sure, the plot could be better and isn't as good as say...all the other films, but it isn't terrible. The special effects are ten years ahead of its time and there is plenty of eye candy. The action scenes are surely the best of the six films in my opinion, and the final battles are easily the best battles in Star Wars. Only reason it isn't my favorite and is a 9, is because of and I'm sure all you Star Wars fanatics agree: Jar Jar Binks. Enough said there.",9,16,27,10 September 2010
The Dark Knight," One of the greatest films of all time
","This is an amazing film that was definitely one of the best ever. Very complex but not too much for the watcher to not understand or be lost and lose interest in the film. There are many climaxes, great action scenes, and several plot twists and a good moral that everyone can live by. Heath Ledger (who is one of the best actors who ever lived) created the darkest most psychotic man in movie history and makes who feel an emotion for The Joker (in this case it is hatred). Aaron Eckhart also gives a true and sadistic performance. Great performances also come from Maggie Gylenhaal, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Christian Bale (who continues to play an amazing Batman. I am a little shocked at the PG-13 rating because of the level of sadism in here and The Joker (and I am 15 years old) is very scary and I could barely sleep. The only reason I give it a 9 is because the voice of Batman grows on you and becomes annoying after an hour or so. Great writing, directing, cinematography, art direction, visual effects, music, and it is the biggest shock how The Reader (which is only decent in my opinion) got nominated for Best Picture instead of this. The Dark Knight was definitely snubbed big time and it is unfair that it was not a Best Picture Nominee. Overall, it is amazing and you should watch it.",10,1,8,26 March 2009
