Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I cannot believe how bad this movie was
","I should make it perfectly clear that I really, really wanted to like this movie, despite all of the negative early reviews of it. But that is not possible. What I am truly amazed by now are all of those individuals who, after waiting for weeks in line, have now finally seen the movie - with the majority of them insisting that 'The Phantom Menace' is one of the greatest movies they have ever seen. It is not even a good movie. You people truly give new meaning to the term 'delusional'. How sad it must be to wait for all these years and all of this hype just to be presented with this totally emotionless experience. Why not just admit it? This is one seriously disappointing movie.",3,0,1,19 May 1999
