Mission: Impossible III," Way Better than 2
","In the first movie, at least the last time I watched it, it was kind of slow. The second movie was 'slower' in the sense that someone must have passed out and hit the slow-motion button... way too much slo-mo. However, this movie started with a shock and left you wondering what was going to happen next, and the story line made it work, because this movie had one apposed to its preceding movie. I can really say that since 1996 I have been a fan of this franchise (sorry to the people that hate it because they loved the TV shows they were before my time) I saw the fist one probably 150 times and the second one I liked the fights but it just did not have a good enough plot... but this movie redeems the M:I name and you'll be surprised I'm sure.",10,5,9,5 May 2006
