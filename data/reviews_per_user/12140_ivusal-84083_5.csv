Requiem for a Dream," just wow
","Maaan, what a film it is! I finished it almost now, and this shocked me and said me again and again 'never use drug!'. I have watched lots of men when they using drug. But after spending my time on watching this masterpiece, I am sure I will never use it. This is the pretty valuable 'don't use narcotic/drug' ad I have seen ever. Actually, I watched lots of films, even show in theatre, but this one is really powerful in its own way. Also can be added that in terms of acting, especially performance of Jared Leto, it is type of the film I would love to rate as 8 star.",8,0,0,2 January 2020
Little Miss Sunshine," Sunny or dark, comedy should never be as predictable as Little Miss Sunshine
","I watched this film one week ago and then one terrible thing happened to me. I broke my phone. It is okay I know, but it is the 4th time in the same year and I felt terrible when noticing that broke. But I suddenly thought that okay Vusal remember that films you recently watched. Did you remember what these guys were doing when meeting terrible stuffs. Yes they are doing their works whenever happens if it is someting they can not prevent it to happen. Yes I did say to me these.
When I watched this film, and saw their grandpa died, they nearly did not catch registration, I understood the main target of film, key point in it. I got it babe. Yeeeaah that s the lesson I learned from this beautiful, nice and very sweet film!",9,0,1,2 January 2020
1917," A deadly drama
","A deadly drama. Breathtaking war film. I dont know who was the director, but they depicted 1st world war very well. There were 2-3second moments in the film which it can take you to think about it for 3-4hours, there were 2-3 seconds moments in the film that you can dive into it and stay here for 3-4 hours.. Yeah really deserved to take time and watch it !!",9,1,2,24 March 2020
Cold War," oh my word, this scene..
","One of My friends who has great taste of films recommended to watch it after showing one scene from it. Maybe you already got which scene is that. Yeah in the early minutes of it, whey they were invited as a team to night (I think), and they stood in front of mirror looking at crowd. And Boom! This was one of the best scenes I have seen ever. Then I decided to watch it immediately.",9,0,0,2 January 2020
12 Years a Slave," Nice one!
","Early minutes into the movie seem really boring, and as if talk to us the end of story, everything I already knew about slavery. But after moments and moments, it takes point and direction. Especially great story, superbly acted and beautifully shot can be noted.",8,0,2,2 January 2020
