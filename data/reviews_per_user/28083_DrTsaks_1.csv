Requiem for a Dream," OH MY GOD
","This is by far the most frightening thing I have ever seen in my life. Not just movies, but anything...no exaggeration.  I have never actually felt this physically sick after watching a movie before.  I feel like I have been punched in the stomach twice and then forced to stuff 20 extra strength tylenol down my sore throat.  The most powerful thing to ever hit movies...this is a fact.  I am not saying it is the best movie, because it isn't, but if you just look at raw exposure the film has to the audience, it is by far the most extreme.  If you are able to walk away from this film and not feel anything, something is wrong with you...very wrong.  I DARE YOU TO SEE THIS MOVIE",10,1,2,8 July 2001
