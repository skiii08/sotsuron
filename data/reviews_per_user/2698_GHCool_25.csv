Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious
","I thought it was hilarious; and even more offensive than I thought it was going to be. I think fans of Borat will find it worthy, unlike the Jiminy Glick movie. I saw it in a screening with a nearly full house in Los Angeles and the entire theater was rolling in the aisles. It was about as good and as funny as I expected it to be, so I guess in my opinion, it did live up to the hype.After seeing the movie I'm pretty sure that the Pamela Anderson bagging thing was scripted, but while I was watching the scene, I felt genuinely shocked and the thought didn't go through my head. What was especially funny to me was that whenever Borat was speaking Kazakh, he was actually speaking Hebrew mixed with gibberish. My Armenian friend who saw it with me said that Borat's producer/sidekick was speaking Armenian.",6,2,7,4 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," I Was Really Surprised ...
","The posters and previews made this movie look sort of cheesy, but it was actually quite a good movie.  Very handsomely produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and good to great performances by all.  Johnny Depp was really funny and Geoffrey Rush had a lot of fun with his role too.  The writers (who also wrote SHREK and THE MASK OF ZORRO) gave this simple and chliched story life through witty dialogue and characters.My biggest complaint was with Gore Verbinski's direction of the sword fight scenes.  I think that he and his cinematographer tried to mask the mediocre choreography by quick cutting weird angles that obscure the action. However, Verbinski did a pretty good job on the ship battle scenes.  That moonlight/skeleton effect was really cool.  I'd love to see a making-of documentary on the DVD.My Grade:9 out of 10P.S. We saw a preview for HAUNTED MANSION before the movie.  It actually looked like it might be pretty cool.",9,0,1,27 July 2003
Finding Nemo," Pretty good
","FINDING NEMO is better than A BUG'S LIFE, but not as good as the TOY STORY movies or MONSTERS, INC.  The animation was beautiful and the voice acting was great (especially Albert Brooks).  It also had a cute story with something positive to say.  I would have liked it as much as the TOY STORY movies if there were more laughs in it.  I only laughed out loud once or twice.  That PSYCHO girl with the braces was funny.My Grade:9 out of 10P.S. Before the movie begins, they play one of Pixar's shorts from the late 1980s called 'KNICK KNACK.' I saw 'KNICK KNACK' in its original form before and was sort of angry that Disney censored it this time around.  There were two things missing from the beautiful women the snowman is attracted to and it doesn't take much of an imagination to know what those two things are.",9,0,0,4 June 2003
Barry Lyndon," Interesting, but Long
","Barry Lyndon is a GOOD film.  However it is also an extremely long film, but a very interesting one.  It is my least favorite Stanley Kubrick film, which is saying a lot about the man's career.  This is the only Kubrick film I would not consider a GREAT film, but only a GOOD one.  How many times do you come across a filmmaker who's movies are so good that the worst you could say about your least favorite one of his movies is that it is 'GOOD?'I definitely would have cut a few scenes if I had directed it, but I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in European history.One word of advice: the movie is broken up into two parts and divided by an intermission.  I suggest you watch the first part one day and the second part the next day.  That's what I did and I think I enjoyed it more because of it.Second word of advice: my mother bought me the Stanley Kubrick Collection on DVD for my birthday.  I had not seen the movie before my mom bought the DVD for me.  I was not very impressed with the DVD.  It doesn't have any special features except French, widescreen, and a rather lame trailer and the quality wasn't up to par with the other DVDs in the collection.  Until they make a better DVD, I suggest renting a widescreen VHS copy.  Its cheaper that way.",6,2,9,21 December 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," Great film
","I always loved going to the movies as a child.  When I was in fifth grade, I saw Toy Story for the first time.  I remember watching the movie and drinking in the computer-animated visuals and feeling the speed and urgency of the big chase scene at the end.  Toy Story was the movie that changed my life.When I saw Monsters Inc, I felt like I was in fifth grade again.  Pixar has gone so far since Toy Story.  Just look at Sully's fur as it moves because of the changing environment.  There are jokes for adults and children alike. And if you thought the chase scene between Sid's dog and the toys was amazing, you haven't seen nothing until you've seen the chase scene involving the roller coster of doors.  I would feel confident to say that that scene is one of the best chase scenes in motion picture history.",10,0,1,17 November 2001
Watchmen," Left me cold
","I never read the comic so I went in completely cold. After seeing it, I have even less of a desire to read the comic than I did before I saw it.None of the characters or plot lines engaged me on a human level in the way The Dark Knight, Sin City, or the Spider-Man films did. In fact, I actively disliked every character and had not a care in the world whatsoever if any of them lived, died, achieved their goals, failed to achieve their goals or anything else. I agree with Rorschach when he criticizes Dr. Manhattan for making the entire movie unnecessary. The film is also extremely violent, which I guess is part of the book, but I wasn't prepared for it. Conan is right when he says its closer to Saw than Spider-Man. The ads make it look like X-Men or something.I didn't think Watchmen was particularly insightful when it came to matters spiritual or scientific. The two most philosophical conversations both take place on Mars; one is kind of an Ecclesiastes-lite and the other is a sort of post hoc ergo propter hoc explanation of what the film considers a 'miracle.'On the other hand, the visuals are extremely impressive. I know some people didn't like the compositing and animation of Dr. Manhattan, but I couldn't disagree more. Overall, I'd give the movie a 10 out of 10 on the production level and a 4 out of 10 on a story level.",4,6,12,7 March 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Whatever
","I'm a little surprised about how poorly THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is being received by critics.  It got a mere 37% on Rotten Tomatoes.com.  STAR TREK: NEMESIS somehow managed to get 40%.I didn't hate THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, but I didn't like it either.  Some parts of it were cool, other parts were lame.  It really didn't affect me very much.  I think the Wachowski brothers could do better.  With all those awesome special effects, its a shame that there wasn't really a strong story in THE MATRIX RELOADED or in THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS.Also, did anyone else notice how few scenes Keanu Reeves has in this movie in comparison to the first two MATRIX films? And even in those scenes, did anyone notice how few lines of dialogue he had? Also, about two-thirds of the way through the movie, something happens to Reeves's character that makes his performance even more limited than it was already.  It wouldn't surprise me if the producers did all of that on purpose so that the movie would have as little of Reeves's bad acting as possible.My grade:5 out of 10.",5,0,0,6 November 2003
Tropic Thunder," Satire has little basis in reality
","I'm gonna disagree with the majority and say that Tropic Thunder had a couple of chuckles, but was overall a rather dull comedy and a not very funny action film. I felt that the actors were mugging for the camera and the cheap shots at Hollywood were so far removed from reality that most of the satire fell flat.Consider the Robert Downey Jr character. Downey did as good a job as anyone could in that role, but the role itself was not funny past the first second we see him. It was basically the same joke told throughout the film and it was only slightly amusing the first time. I'm not sure if African Americans were offended by the role, but I wouldn't be surprised because the character is not making any satirical comment that relates to anything in reality. Its just a white guy acting like a black guy. Ha ha ha, right? Not really. The treatment of retarded people was also offensive, in my opinion, as was the treatment of Vietnamese people.",3,9,16,9 September 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Not so bad.
","Just saw AVP last night. My friends dragged me to see it despite my numerous complaints and suggestions to see other movies.I expected it to be total s**t, but I ended up kind of enjoying it. Its trash, but its trash made by talented people. People in the theater near us were making wise cracks (a la 'Mystery Science Theater 3000') which added to the overall experience. I couldn't help making a few myself.Its the kind of movie where the entire audience laughs at what's on screen, despite the fact that the filmmakers may or may not have intended it to be funny. I saw it in Burbank, CA in a theater with a pretty hip audience of teenagers and college students. There's at least 10 better movies out right now, but if you're in a goofy mood, go ahead and see it, but make sure you bring a goofy friend with you.",6,0,0,14 August 2004
Batman Begins," Tim Burton's was better.
","This one was definitely darker than the other Batman films, which a lot of people praised. The Tim Burton film was sufficiently dark, but also had enough humor in it to make it a fun movie. Batman Begins was so concerned about anger and grief that, for me at least, it never really engaged my 'inner child,' which, to me, is the point of a superhero movie.There are people I know who would hear me say that and tell me that I don't understand Batman or that I don't understand comic book heroes in general. That may be so, but the fact remains that this movie fun in the same sense that Spider-Man or even Burton's Batman is. Whether that's a positive aspect or a negative aspect of the film is, I suppose, a matter of personal taste.That being said, I thought the production was beautiful and there were some good performances. Chicago was very well used as the location of Gotham City (was anyone else reminded of The Blues Brothers during the car chase sequence?). Christopher Nolan is, in my opinion, the best living filmmaker under the age of 40, but Insomnia and Memento were more complex films in terms of story and character.Maybe if Batman was an insomniac with a short term memory disorder ...",9,1,2,18 June 2005
Seabiscuit," Almost a Great Film
","Its a very well made film.  Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper deserve special recognition for their performances.  Gary Ross, he did an EXCELLENT job directing! I really hope he gets an Oscar nomination for his work.  The cinematography by John Schwartzman and the costume design by Judianna Makovsky also deserve special recognition.The only really big problem with the film is its length.  It takes something like an hour and ten minutes before Seabiscuit is even introduced.  Some of the characters' back stories really could have been trimmed heavily. Also, I thought that Tobey Maguire has done better work in the past.  For example, his work in PLEASANTVILLE, also directed by Gary Ross, was far superior.

28 Days Later...," Great film, but similar to SALVATION
","I think this is one of the best horror/zombie-type films I've ever seen. However, its amazing how similar this movie is to SALVATION, a short film I co-produced with Michael Lalaian and went on to win a CINE Golden Eagle (look it up on the IMDb!).  SALVATION is about a post-apocalyptic world in which 'infected' people (in SALVATION they're called 'Shadow Walkers' and they are caused by radiation ... not disease) have killed the families of two lonely young people who decide to stick together and face the world. All four of the protagonists are VERY similar to the protagonists of SALVATION and so is the plot. Many key conversations and situations come directly out of SALVATION.Despite my jealousy that Danny Boyle got his film produced and distributed before I could produce and distribute SALVATION at feature length, I thought Danny Boyle, the director, was very clever at using limited resources to create a profound statement on human nature.  All of the actors did a pretty good job too, but Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleason's performances were especially noteworthy.  Its also a pretty scary film.  No film has scared me more since Signs.My Grade:10 out of 10",10,0,1,30 June 2003
Transformers," Michael Bay's best film yet
","Transformers is surprisingly a really, really good movie. Sure, its camp and cheese and the plot doesn't make sense for even one second, but as far as movies like this go, Transformers is made with a certain precision and style missing in either of the Fantastic Four movies. Also, surprisingly, Transformers is quite funny too. I've laughed as harder and as often at the jokes and gags in Transformers as I did in most of the comedies I've seen this year. Again, they're certainly better than the gags in Fantastic Four.Of course, the visual effects and sound design are the real stars of this movie, and boy do they deliver! The Transformers look like they are really in the environments they appear to be in. The sound design will probably go unmentioned in a lot of reviews and stuff, but they deserve a nod too because they managed to find create a new and interesting aural feel for giant robots built on past archetypes, but still completely original. There's one Transformer that transforms from a briefcase into a biped about 5 feet tall that has this voice, look, and way of moving like a little animal that I found fascinating, funny, and cool at the same time.So in short, if you buy a ticket to this movie, you will be seeing probably the best Michael Bay film there ever was and perhaps ever will be. If you're looking for more than that, then this isn't the movie for you.",9,2,6,3 July 2007
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Best Christmas Movie
","I sent a version of this review to Salon critic Andrew O'Hehir after he neglected to mention Nightmare Before Christmas in his review of Christmas films:Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. If you're a pop culture junkie, I assume you've seen the film, and if you're a good film critic, I assume you agree that it contains the 'meaning of Christmas' aspect of Its a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street plus the 'dark twist' of Batman Returns (although Nightmare is a superior film and a more relevant film to Christmas). Unlike Home Alone (which was released around the same time), it is also a film that has aged incredibly well. Watch it today and it still holds up as the state of the art in animation and a dynamic story.",10,1,1,8 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," So many reasons
","What's everyone raving about? It is clear as day to me that this is a satisfactory movie at best and a dull movie at worst. It is not a great movie or even a very good movie. I realize I'm in the minority, but this movie was basically a remake of Flash Gordon (1980) combined with the Power Rangers movie with a few added clichés from Star Wars. While they were playing those 70s hits, I kept hoping for Queen to sing 'Flash! Agh! Savior of the universe!' That would have actually been funny.It's a mess story-wise. It doesn't define it's world; if anything can happen for any reason (or no reason), then nothing's compelling or suspenseful. Action sequences are indecipherable in terms of cause and effect. I kept thinking I should be caring more. Like when the sisters were fighting. There seems to be some history there that made the fight meaningful, but it didn't register. The villain, a ripoff of the Emperor, Skeletor, and Ming, isn't interesting in the least. His motivations are never firmly established.",4,23,59,9 August 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Very Silly
","KILL BILL: VOL. 1 is one of the silliest (and goriest) movie I've ever seen. That being said, the excellent production value and tongue-in-cheek nature make the film highly entertaining.  The whole movie is one long attempt to be cool.  Uma Thurman gives a pretty good performance as the Bride and Vivica A. Fox stands out as a suburban mother who also happens to be a deadly assassin.  Quentin Tarantino reaffirms his status as one of the strangest and most interesting directors now working.  The director of photography, Robert Richardson (who worked on many of Oliver Stone's movies) deserves some special recognition as well.",8,0,1,11 October 2003
Big Fish," A pleasant, but meaningless film
","BIG FISH is not one of Tim Burton's best films, but it put a smile on my face for two hours, and for that, I'm grateful.  Albert Finney and Billy Crudup give very good performances as a father and son who do not understand each other.  Ewan McGregor is also good as Finney's younger self who goes on fantastic adventures.  The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous.  The special effects and make up were also fantastic.The problem with the film is that nothing ever really happens.  No lessons are learned and it was all just a fantasy.  Nothing is ever at stake.  Tim Burton is a master filmmaker who no doubt will continue making great films, but this is not one of them.  Its a good film, but not as good as it could be.If you want to find a great film with fantastic visual effects, I would suggest WHAT DREAMS MAY COME.  More is at stake in that film.My grade:6 out of 10",6,0,0,25 December 2003
Into the Wild," Grizzly Man was better
","I liked the movie mostly because of its performances, specifically the Emile Hirsch's and Hal Halbrook's. I thought Halbrook should have won the Oscar.As for the controversy surrounding what the meaning of the film and of McCandless's death was, I'm going to go with the Alaskan rangers on this one and say that McCandless was arrogant and suicidal. His mom and dad didn't seem like the best parents in the world, but I have more sympathy for them and their loss than I do for McCandless himself. Thousands of young American adults grew up under worse circumstances than McCandless, but most of them don't die for a half-baked political statement that nobody is listening to anyway. The thing that irritated me about this movie is how ambiguously it treats its main character. Throughout most of the film, it portrays McCandless as an almost Jesus-like figure. Indeed, during his death scene, the editor inter-cuts images of McCandless suffering from malnutrition with angelic camera movements of the sky/clouds as if McCandless is ascending to Heaven. On the other hand, in his final moments, McCandless seems to admit to himself (and the world) that he may have made a terrible mistake and most of the colorful characters he meets on his journey seem to agree that his extremism will get him in terrible trouble. I much preferred Werner Herzog's documentary Grizzley Man which is about a similar true story of a man who that died while camping in Alaska. Herzog is less ambiguous on the point that his subject's life and death is a warning against defying common sense for the sake of idealism and is a meditation on the human condition and its place within nature. Penn's film felt hero worship for a man who essentially tied himself to a railroad track and expected the train to go around him.",7,1,2,21 April 2008
Mystic River," Good film.
","MYSTIC RIVER was a good film with some very good performances, but I was a little bit unclear about what it was trying to say.  There are themes about pedophilia, revenge, justice, and trust, but they never all come together into one strong statement at the end.  This was also a weakness of Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN.  However, this shouldn't discourage people from seeing this film which has some truly great performances.  Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Marcia Gay Hardin all give some of the best performances of their career.  Lawrence Fishburn gives a very good performance as well as Kevin Bacon's partner.My grade:7 out of 10",7,1,1,19 October 2003
The Departed," Great performances, choppy editing.
","I thought the entire cast was excellent. The performances made the movie for me. It didn't seem very Scorsese-ish though. Its a cops and robbers kind of movie and it seemed to me like it could have been directed by anyone competent and didn't require a master filmmaker. It didn't explore the psyche of these people in the way that Goodfellas did, but as a popcorn thriller, it worked.I didn't really like how the sound and picture were cut though. It felt a little choppy, but it was clearly the style Scorsese was going for. Like the music would cut out suddenly or it was competing with the dialogue. Sometimes picture edits would bump together like a jump cut. Did anyone else notice this?",6,1,2,14 October 2006
There Will Be Blood," A shallow film with some great performances
","The real reason to see this movie is for Daniel Day-Lewis's incredible performance which reminded me of his performance in GANGS OF NEW YORK crossed with Jack Nicholson's in THE SHINING. My biggest criticism of the movie is that it didn't follow through on the whole theme of the price of modernity. The price of modernity is even more of an issue today than it was in 1911, and on both an international and local scale. An outsider comes to town and suggests you compromise your way of life, and in return, society in general will prosper, but nowhere near as much as the stranger will prosper. And who's to say whether or not society really prospers? All of this is fascinating, philosophically dense stuff, so it was a let down for me that the movie abandoned this theme and went for the mad psychopath plot crossed with the sad billionaire plot that we've seen before in countless other movies. I definitely recommend the movie, Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is certainly worth the price of admission, but from a thematic point of view, the movie is much more thin than it ought to have been.",6,10,33,16 January 2008
Iron Man," A minority opinion
","A lot of people have been said during the opening weekend of Iron Man that it ranks among the best comic book films of all time. I have to respectfully disagree and state that I am clearly in the minority of people who thought this movie was derivative, predictable, and didn't even involve me on an emotional level, except for in a couple of the flying scenes. I thought the best scene was when Iron Man was being shot by the two fighter planes. The whole Jeff Bridges subplot was the weakest part and by the time he put on his own metal suit and fought Iron Man in public, the movie lost me completely. There was nothing wrong with it on a technical level. It is thrilling and awesome enough and all of that, but I think I've seen too many monsters/robots/superheroes fighting each other in public that it had better be shot differently or have different developments than the old 'now we're in the lab -- now we're on the freeway -- now we're in the sky -- and back down on a roof' etc etc outline. Yawn. Nothing's at stake. That scene could have been as long or as short as the writers wanted it because its just a series of obstacles. What's the difference if the robots are fighting in 1 locations or 3 or 5 or 10 as long since each location has nothing to do with the previous or next one and eventually lead to the same conclusion anyway?",4,6,14,5 May 2008
Bruce Almighty," GOOD film
","After a slow beginning, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny film that had something positive to say.  It wasn't one of Jim Carrey's best performances, but he was still OK.  Morgan Freeman was just right as God.  Jennifer Aniston had some good moments.  I miss Steve Correll on 'THE DAILY SHOW!'I like director Tom Shadyac's choices of movies.  He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR.  In all three of those and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him.  A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie.  My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people.  That's too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity.My Grade:7 out of 10",7,0,0,26 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," really entertaining
","It was MUCH better than the first one! The action and special effects sequences in this movie were top notch. I didn't much care about the first one and as I was watching it, I realized one of the reasons why: the first one was mainly establishing all the characters and their powers and left hardly any room for action and coolness. The second one basically devoted ALL of its time to action and coolness because all the characters were already established by the first movie. I also think Bryan Singer, the director, improved 100%. I thought he was wrong for X-MEN 1 and I wasn't a big fan of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but on X2, he did an excellent job. Maybe a lot of people helped him on X2 since the budget was a lot bigger. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel (who worked on the first X-MEN movie and on THREE KINGS) was also really creative. I especially liked the scene where Mystique seduces the prison guard in the bar. It has really clever and weird angles. Of course the special effects and makeup was awesome (especially the stuff with Nightcrawler).There really were only two problems with the movie: the screenplay could have been better and the acting could have been A LOT better. Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen all were pretty good, but everyone else sort of sucked.My grade:7 out of 10",7,0,0,12 May 2003
The Matrix," Good story, great technique
","I saw THE MATRIX again recently.  It was a much different experience when I saw it for the first time.  The first time I saw it was on its opening weekend.  It just looked like a somewhat cool movie and I was bored that day.   It wasn't famous or anything yet.  I walked out of the theater knowing I saw something special, but I didn't realize how special it was (largely because I didn't realize how intricate the special effects are).
Last week was at least the 5th time I saw it.  I was aware of the cult status it had and how many movies copied it and how many of its lines and ideas are memorized by science fiction fans.  I also had a better idea of what went into making it (I don't think I'll ever understand the true complexity of it).I had more admiration this time for the technical stuff, but I felt basically the same about the story.  It is excellent and has a lot of good philosophy, but it doesn't really have an ending.  In place of an ending, it has a long violent action sequence and then the fight between Agent Smith and Neo.   They are among the best action sequences and fights ever filmed, but compared to the richness of the story in the beginning, I always felt it could have been more.What I'm trying to say is that I have no doubt that MATRIX RELOADED and MATRIX REVOLUTIONS are for sure going to be at least as good as the ending of THE MATRIX.  I just hope it also has some of the stuff that made the beginning and middle of THE MATRIX great too.",10,0,1,14 April 2003
