Requiem for a Dream," Amazing and powerful film
","The is by far the most powerful film I've ever seen.  I was left in awe after seeing the movie. The actors portray their characters better than any other I've seen in another movie. Marlon Wayans was the biggest shocker. Hes obviously a very flexible actor. Two thumbs up to Darren Aronofsky on his follow up to pi.
Not only is the movie good, but the soundtrack is amazing. The Kronos quartet did an amazing job on the music.  I listen to the soundtrack and I can't help but be reminded of the movie.Once again, 2 thumbs up.",Null,0,1,26 March 2004
