Catch Me If You Can," Leo and Hanks are remarkable
","MPAA Rating: PG-13My Rating: 12 and upMy * rating: 8.5When I first learned about the making of this film, I nearly fainted. Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks in one movie together? That combo didn't click too well with me, but I decided to see it in the opening week, anyway.
Boy was I wrong... The film was remarkable, and everything about it was realistic and exiting, which is just the thing you'd expect from a Speilberg picture. This is one film that I would enjoy seeing time and time again, and it's creators should rejoice. Even Frank Abagnale Jr. should be happy about the release of this picture. The story begins when Frank William Abagnale gives his son, Frank William Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) a check book for his sixteenth birthday. Following his fathers footsteps, he become a con artist. He uses his checks as a way to spend money that he doesn't have. At the same time, he uses his skills to become a doctor, a pilot and a lawyer. Carl Hanratty (Hanks) is an FBI agent who trys to catch him. the real shocker is in the end...This story is superbly told by all actors, especially the two leading actors, DiCaprio in particular. DiCaprio is not the 'Titanic' spoiled teenager that he was in most of his films. He is now a 19 year old adult, something I have been wondering about now for some time, even though he was born in 1974. An excellent film. You will not be dissappointed",8,1,2,5 January 2003
The Ring," Scary but could have been better.
","The Ring, a story of a killer videotape is a good concept, and it was very scary, but it could have been much better. Causes happened without effects and effects occurred without causes. The film was a touch too long, and lots of the scenes were played out for way too long.I can't say that I didn't enjoy it, but there seemed to be something missing in the film. Perhaps it was the element that nothing ever seemed to go together. Seemingly random newspaper ads and such were throughout the film.
While the film was entertaining, it most definitely had flaws. While this film is much better than some of the other things that comes out nowadays, it certainly is no Halloween or Psycho, and it shouldn't be treated as such.MPAA Rating: PG-13 My Rating: 13 & up My * Rating: 7/10",Null,0,0,12 July 2003
Citizen Kane," 'The Greatest Film Of All Time' is a vivid picture for years to come.
","MPAA Rating: PGMy Rating: 10 and upMy * Rating 10.0Lucky for me, I did not know what Rosebud was before veiwing the film, and this information ruins a wonderful two hours if told to someone who hasn't veiwed the film in its entirety. Though many complain that the movie wasn't made very well, they are comparing it to today's special effects galore, and don't give it a full chance. Remember, It was made in 1941!!
The film was bround breaking in many ways, (including finding an uncencored word for a woman's privates (See Battle Over Citizen Kane) and other now famous camera tequneques. Now-a-days these effects are common, but wipe out all memory of new movies and think of other movies pre-1941. Compared to these, this movie is phenomenal. Thank about it.If your watching the DVD, give the 'Battle Over Citezen Kane' a chance. While your at it, see RKO 281, another wonderful film about the same topics.",10,5,8,27 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great Addition to the Series
","MPAA Rating: PGMy Rating 6 and up.My * Rating: 7.5Great film for Star Wars fans. Although it is common knowledge that the orriginal three were better, this one was top-knotch. This film had great special effects, and always keeps you on your feet. Why would anyone mock this film?Ewan McGreaggor is perfect for the role of Anakin, the pre- Darth Vador, although it is near impossible to compare him to Jake Lloyd, with the age difference. Nothing compares with the sci-fi fantasy combo that Star Wars so magnificantly displaysThe story is all about Anakin's teenage years, as he competing for the now-Senator Amadalla's affection, as well as becomming a Jedi Knight. If you like Star Wars and heard that this movie wasn't that good, the people who told you that are from another world.",8,1,1,8 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Triumph, But Worth The Hype?
","MPAA Rating: PG-13My Rating: 12 and UpMy '*' Rating: 8.5/10With no doubt in my mind this film has been a triumph in the motion pictures when it comes to the special effects. This film is everything I expected it to be- great, but overlong. Even though it feels like a two hour movie, It could be shortened in several ways, in my oppinion. The film was excellent, don't get me wrong, but I couldn't bear to watch the extended version. Although I haven't read the books, I am hyped about doing so, and I will as soon as I have spare time.As much as I loved the film, it didn't leave me wanting to see the second one. I felt as if I didn't care if I saw the Two Towers or not. Maybe once I read the books I would enjoy it much more, but until then this film was unforunatlely a dissapointment because of the hype.",9,0,0,3 December 2002
Seabiscuit," Spderman is a Horse Racer!
","Fresh from his role as Spiderman, Tobey Maguire delivers his best performance he possibly ever gave in his career. Along with Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper, he rules the screen as a horse jockey with incredible talent. Fans Of the book by Laura Hillenbrand will not be disappointed. Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) is a young man who would settle for any job offered to him in the Depression Era, and decided to be an exercise boy and stable cleaner. Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) is a carmaker that has a knack for business, and after financial loss in the Stock Market as well as a personal loss, decided to change directions and train racehorses. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is a trainer who liked to heal sick horses so he could let other trainers have a chance to train them. These three men all come together to train Seabiscuit. Seabiscuit is structured like your typical sports film, and it seems to move very slowly in the beginning. They introduce the areas and the times quite nicely, yet excessively. But as the film moves on, it runs much more smoothly as Seabiscuit's tale begins to unfold. Seabiscut himself is a small horse with an immense appetite. He has had many owners in the past, however they all gave up on him thinking that he would never be any good as a racehorse. They lowered his self-esteem tremendously by making him lose to other horses that they were breeding to gain their self-confidence. But this was all before he met three men who would care and love him and help make him a nationally loved sports figure. Since his self-esteem was lowered tremendously, once Red started to express his love and loyalty to Seabiscut, it almost seems as if Seabiscut has an inability to loose, even (and especially) when he is the underdog. (err underhorse?? Is that a word?) The race scenes are absolutely thrilling. Astounding. Spectacular! Pick any word you like! Cinematographer John Schwartzman gets amazingly close to the actors as they ride towards you. It's almost like being right at the gate at the races. Who knew Spidy can ride a horse? An inspirational tale of determination and a strive for perfection, in a direction style that's not unlike Frank Capra {'It's A Wonderful Life' (1946) and 'Mr. Smith Goes To Washington' (1939)}, Gary Ross's stunning work is should not have been overlooked at Oscar-time.Rated PG-13 for some sexual situations and violent sports-related images. Running Time: 140 Minutes. Appropriate for Children aged 12 and up.",9,0,0,25 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Great Movie, But Will Not Be On Any 'Top Movie' Lists in the Future
","The Fellowship has been broken. Boromir (Sean Bean) is dead, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) have gone to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have made friends of the Rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king, Théoden (Bernard Hill). The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White (Sir Ian McKellen), who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him. One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the Ring has now begun...The above is the plot in a nutshell. This 3-hour (3.7 for the Extended version) movie has gone beyond the imaginable. Trees that talk and pick up humans, to this Gollum character who's downright annoying. What is in store for the Return of the King?Don't misunderstand me, I liked the film, and after seeing the original I was anxious to see this one, as I had heard that it would be coming out in the upcoming months. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. well that would be a like. I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but it was way too long. I will definitely see Return of the King in the theater next year but SOMEONE TELL PETER JACKSON TO INCLUDE AN INTERMISSION!While the movie is very visually impressive, I believe that the film is not up to the hype that it was given. I should have known however that it was LOTR worshipers who gave it 26269 ratings of 10. Did it disserve a best picture award? It absolutely did not. I was glad that it got the special effects Oscar, however. But nonetheless, I was able to hold my urine for to hours, for I was intrigued to find out what happened in the end.
The Battle of Helms Deep was probably one of the best battle scenes done since Braveheart and I thought it was an excellent adaptation of Tokien. However, it lingered for too long. I think Tokien would have liked these movies, but disliked at how bored you sometimes you get sitting in the chair.This movie was very good. However, the American Film Institute need not revise its 100 greatest movies of all time for Fellowship or Two Towers. Like many series films, I thought that the first film, The Fellowship, was far superior.MPAA Rating: PG 13My Rating: 12 and up for epic battle sequences and scary imagesMy * Rating 8.8",8,0,0,16 June 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Withstanding the Test Of Time ad holding strong.
","MPAA Rating: GMy Rating: 12 and up.My * Rating 8.9One Fault. Only one fault. What other movie of this stature could hold up to this statement, as the one above? What other Science-Fiction film has only one bad thing about it?The answer is none.In my oppinion, this is the greatest Science fiction film ever to be filmed. The only thing that denies this film a 10 rating is that at the beginning, when you watch the second segment, known by many as the Failure of HAL, you cant seem to get with it, unless you see the trailer. Lucky for us young folk, the trailer is right on the DVD. This is its only fault.Filled with suspense an a touch of black comedy, 2001 makes a night of entertainment memorable for years to come. Although it is slow in many parts, it grips your interest until the film is done. A great film for a long (in my case LIFE-long) family discusion, and even peer discussion.

The Graduate," `The Graduate' graduates Hoffman from amateur actor to a great professional.
","The Graduate, a 1967 film directed by Mike Nichols is a wonderful film starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. Ben Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a graduate from Berkley college has just arrived back home to find that there is a graduation party for him. He feels a little down throughout the entirety of the party and then he meets up with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). She asks if he could take her home in his new car, as she cannot drive. When they get to her house, we learn that she has known Ben for his entire life and that her husband is Mr.  Braddock's boss. They have a few drinks and then go up to her room, where she gets undress. (`Can you get that zipper for me Benjamin?') Ben thinks he is trying to be seduced and is frightened out of his wits. What would happen if Mr. Robinson came home? Mrs. Robinson goes to the bathroom and she undresses, then comes into her bedroom, naked. Ben is there, and is scared out of his wits. A car is heard. Mr. Robinson is home! Mrs. Robinson presses herself onto the door while telling him that it is perfectly okay and Ben grabs the doorknob trying to get out.

So Elaine and Ben go out because Ben's parents literally force him to. Mrs. Robinson tells him that he must make sure that she doesn't like him. After a horrible date, they do fall in love with each other, until he realizes that she's getting married to a jerk.What a movie to think about!

Singin' in the Rain," The Best Musical Of All Time...
","...and I am not merely saying this because I love it..., I am not saying this because AFI says it, but I have watched this film over and over again since I was six, and I have not been able to forget it. It was mentioned at my theater class a few years ago, and it is by far one of the most colorful musical of all time.Who could incorporate more important songs into one musical like they did here? Unlike many musicals that are coming out not, this was originally a movie. The plot is so beautiful, and the songs just nail it on the head.While the film is long... possibly too long for a young child, it is certainly a movie that should not be watched in two sittings. The splendor of the color and the dance sequences are killed when the film is stopped. Believe me. I know this from experience. The plot is relatively simple. Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lana Lamont (Jean Hagan) are two legendary silent film stars. A young Debbie Reynolds is a great Kathy Selden, a girl who is trying to break into the film business. Lana Lamont (Jean Hagan), who is Don's stage girlfriend, disproves of Kathy's breaking in, because Kathy is winning Don's affection and love. All at the same time, a movie that Don and Lana have made, `The Dueling Caviler' is not safe. Warner Brothers has come out with their first talkie, `The Jazz Singer' and studios are now converting to sound. Not only that, but they must do so, also, in order for the long-awaited film, `The Dueling Caviler' to be a success. So Don, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and Kathy decide that the film must be made into a musical, `The Dancing Cavalier'. One problem- Lana's wretched voice. Kathy will have to dub all of Lana's lines and songs without Lana knowing.The film ends with a great finale and all throughout the film the sons are intertwined with great fun. Not only is this film the best film ever, it is one of the most fun!MPAA Rating: GMy Rating: 4-upMy * Rating: 9.5This film contains: Minor Violence.",10,2,6,21 May 2003
Some Like It Hot," The `Chicago' Of The Sixties
","Filmed in 1959 with an all-star cast, Some Like it Hot is definitely one of the funniest pictures I have ever seen. It was rated the funniest picture of all time by the AFI, a milestone achievement. The film is a great achievement and the comedy is perfect. Jack Lemmon steals the show. Tony Curtis is a millionaire, and Marilyn Monroe singing! What can be better?When two male musicians whiteness a mob murder in Chicago, 1929, they are forced to flee to somewhere so that they are not caught. They find a job for three weeks in Florida, but there is one problem. It is a girl's band. So what do they do? They buy shavers to shave their legs, they buy wigs and dresses and they are now Josephine and Daphne, the pretty girls who play the Tenor Sax and String Bass, respectively. They are not suspected until a crazy ending with a load of laughter in between. The film is a no-brainer classic with all the ingredients to last a lifetime of wonderful funny memories. You'll laugh like you've never laughed before. And it was made over 40 years ago! Not every movie holds up like that!***The Next Paragraph Includes What Some May Call A Minor Spoiler***This film is worth buying the DVD, and it is fun to watch different segments over and over. One segment particularly comes to mind: the ending. Jack Lemmon tries to explain why he can't marry Osgood, another man.
With a great story, plot and laughs, Some Like It Hot is one of the best films of all time. MPAA Rating: PG My Rating: 13 and upMy * Rating: 9.1",9,2,3,25 June 2003
Psycho," The Best Horror Film? No. The best suspense film? Absolutely!
","Yes, this is the greatest suspense film of all time. Yes, back in 1960 it was probably scary, but if the film is watched in modern times, the film is not too scary as it is suspenseful. The story is exactly like Robert Bloch's novel, which was excellent, and I have now read it several times. It always makes me jump, no matter how many times I see it, and I've seen it many times now.Includes the famous 'shower scene'  which has never been duplicated since its filming in 1960",10,0,0,23 January 2003
Rear Window," Hitchcock's Best??
","MPAA Rating: PGMy Rating: 10 and up My * Rating 8.5OK, I agree. This is not Hitchcock's best work in my oppinion, but why are people booing it as his worst? The film, directed on a very low budget, was very well acted, directed and produced. For God's sake, the whole movie takes place in Stuart's room!This film god in Hitchcock's own way, is suspenseful at every corner. I was often shocked many times, and sometimes I had to leave the room to hold on to a wall while watching it... Superbly done, as with all Hitchcock films, and no one has any right to disarm its power.",10,0,2,27 January 2003
