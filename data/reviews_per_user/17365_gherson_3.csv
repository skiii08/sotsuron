Blade Runner 2049," walked out
","Didn't like at all, walked out two hours in.The deal-breakers:1. In the introductory text, we're told that though replicants are *humans*, they're bioengineered, so it's a truth universally acknowledged (by non-replicants) that they're slaves and/or property to be hunted down and murdered. Ridiculous! Only with robots can the ethics of that be potentially ambiguous.2. At hour 2: The bad guys catch K and all but kill him because stopping him is mission critical, then just let him go. What could possibly go wrong!I will say I liked K's robo-hologram. Twas a poignant touch to make her programming somehow decide to share K in trifurcated fornication. To sacrifice customer mind-share hints at transcendence and amore.",2,4,10,12 November 2017
"I, Tonya"," enjoy at your leisure
","That this is a sad story and dark comedy is the truth, and that 'there's no such thing as truth', isn't. You'll be entertained while mostly shaking your head.",8,1,1,22 February 2018
