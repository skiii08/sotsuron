Sucker Punch," watch Brazil instead
","I am sure I am not the first one to say it - but the movie Brazil did this theme first and did it waaaaaaaay better. Movies like this try to use block buster special effects as their only selling point - but without characters you care about, a solid story you can relate to and an over all understanding of who your audience is - what you end up with is a 2 hour video game in which you are just an observer. This film actually reminded me of the miserable failure 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'. If you saw that movie you'd know what I'm talking about - All special effects, no story, and no characters you care about. I actually don't want to waist my time talking to much about this movie - let's just say if all you care about is special effects (and believe me you've seen them all before) then please rush out to see 'Sucker Punch' - if you are even the slightest bit interested in a movie with substance avoid this like the plague. I watched this for free and I still feel Sucker Punched.",1,1,5,10 July 2011
The Others," Boring and unoriginal
","I guess people are really easy to please because there are so many good reviews for this movie. Well - I am hear to warn you that this is not either good, entertaining or original. If you can't figure out the 'surprise' ending which has been done a trillion times before ('Carnival of Souls' 1962, 'Voices' 1973, an episode of 'The Twilight Zone' 1959, 'the Sixth Sense'1999, etc....) then you mustn't watch many movies. This movie is long and boring if you don't know the ending and if you are like most people and see it coming in the very beginning of the film then it is excruciating to sit through. It has been called 'spooky' and 'eerie' and 'atmospheric' by other reviewers - but in my opinion it is over produced and in your face and at no time let me forget I was watching a movie. All I could think of was how much my ass hurt in the theater for 2 hours. Anyway - hopefully someone will read this review and dodge this bullet - or bomb I should say.",1,14,37,29 June 2011
Insidious," One of the better unintentional comedies I've seen
","Well - to say this movie contains every ghost story, horror movie cliché ever used would be an understatement. But - for me that is exactly what made it entertaining to watch. I still can't decide whether the creators were using every trick in the book on purpose as a joke or if they really thought they were making something new and shocking? I would put my money on this whole thing being a big joke because I know these guys can make scary movies if they want to. I am rather surprised at how many reviewers say this is the scariest movie they have ever seen! I suppose if you have never seen a single horror movie in your life this might make sense - but for those of us who have seen 'Poltergeist' or 'The Shining' you absolutely know exactly what is coming around each corner of this film, right down to the piano strikes and violin shrills when something jumps out at you. As other reviewers have said - this movie starts off pretty strong and seems to really try and build an eerie atmosphere - but by the film's midpoint it sinks into just plain silliness and becomes almost slapstick comedy by the end. What other reviewers are not saying is that not only does the movie quickly sink into a world of silly clichés - but it also seems to lose all of it's budget. To me it seemed like the production quality suddenly drops off and starts looking like a cheesy straight to video horror movie from the 1980's. Ghosts are clearly just stage hands in white face makeup surrounded by smoke from a fog machine. The final 10 minutes when all hell breaks loose has one of the most non shocking endings ever. If you don't see it coming a million miles away then you are one of those people who has never seen a horror movie before this one. In conclusion - This movie should absolutely be marketed as a horror/comedy (if not a straight up comedy). Every moment that was supposed to make you jump with fear instead made me convulse with laughter. So if you are looking for a good scare - don't watch this movie - but if you just want to be entertained and have a good laugh then by all means check it out.",1,5,16,7 April 2011
