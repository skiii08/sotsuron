Scarface," Long Live Pacino
","However controversial this film may be, it is most certainly a classic. Al Pacino as 'Scarface' is a character who none of us would dare to be but all us would like to think we have a bit of inside of us. A true bada**. Never going to be held in as high acclaim as the Godfather and nor should it be, but it is up there as one of my all time favourite movies and is certainly one which i can watch again and again. Brilliant ending also, not many die in a better way than pacino in this movie, 'say hello to my little friend' dying in the same way that the film had been all the way through, in your face. most swearing ever also, 8.5 out of 10",8,0,1,22 September 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," costly piddle
","hmmmm, lets see if that isn't one of most most recent examples of 'we've seen all this before' then I'm not sure what is. The advert didn't give much away(easily good enough to get the kevs running to their seats) and i suppose we all know why now don't we, nothing to really get people moving to the cinema's in droves to be honest. I mean come on, that ice age breezed over as quickly as it came on, what was all the fuss about in the end, the only person that died was the seemingly foolish president who stayed back at the white house to oversee the coming of doom. At least this film had Troy around to put it in its place. Absolute earwax comes to mind in terms of worth paying to watch. Too many special effects and not enough good viewing, was funny to think about afterwards but on a serious note.......toxic",Null,2,4,28 November 2004
Fargo," you have got to be kidding
","If you actually watch this film, and walk away saying u seriously liked it, i am afraid you are a true gargoyle. The acting in this...... Come on then explain! How is it this bad, why do they talk like lizards? A blind spaniel could have made me feel me comfortable with his portrayal of the characters. I mean how this film can be rated as OK even, is an insult to any good movies. I turned the movie off in disgust before it could even finish me off. The terrible acting made me squirm uneasily in my seat, as if a bunch of infants were trying their damndest but just weren't up to the task. SeWaGe. If there was a hazard perception test whilst watching this movie i wouldn't have stopped clicking. Please send a written apology to the creators of the movie, that their head wasn't clamped and stamped 'beetle' the day after it release. spam",1,12,31,28 November 2004
Pearl Harbor," Embarrassment
","What a waste of money. Oh great i see you have camera's on those dropping bombs. How about you forget that for a while and try tearing up the script and starting again or better still forgetting the whole idea. Ben Affleck was the first error of many, good in changing lanes, terrible in just about anything else. Then the love story, painfully awful, the love of her life leaves, and she is so in love that she falls in love with his mate and then the fun of a boring love triangle begins. the action goes on forever and tell me how many people you actually see being killed during this time? Simply one of the biggest flops in Hollywood history, barf. Oscar for worst picture 2001, then this film has grabbed it with both hands.",Null,3,6,22 September 2004
Braveheart," True epic
","This is one, if not the most powerful film i have ever watched. the true meaning of the word epic. I do not think it is the best film of all time, though it probably is my favourite, but it is certainly up there. Taking the viewer through every possible emotion, and the pre-fight speech is the best any film has ever seen. Every time it makes my hairs stand on end, and there are many points during this movie which still grab me as if it is the first time i am experiencing it. Action, romance, drama, betrayal and so on, this film has it all, and despite hearing criticism and mel Gibson in this role, his accent remains Scottish and he has here his true gem, something which Tom Cruise would love to have had in his career so far and the only thing he lacks. Best Picture, no doubt about it with this one- classic.",10,0,1,22 September 2004
