It," Not too scary, but Amazing!
","'Stranger Things' vibes, set in the same period of 1980s, 'IT' is amazing paced, written, styled. Pennywise is a lot creepier looking than any other clown whose terrorized the silver screen, it almost has a mythical aspect to his character. The tone is very consistent as the main characters are teenagers masterfully portrayed by these kid actors.
Iconic moments from the original TV spot and the book was recreated in a creative way, and gives 'Pennywise the dancing clown' a whole new meaning!",8,0,2,18 January 2019
Hereditary," This movie is next level!
","This is the most unique horror movie I've seen, the scares are unique, creepy and effective. Story is really good and deserves a second screening .",9,2,5,9 July 2019
Captain Marvel," It's meh.
","Better than I expected. Note that I had zero to begin with.
Probably equivalent to Dr.Strange or Thor 1 in MCU terms.
They tried so hard to make Captain Marvel important, and the power scale is all messed up in this, couple of feminism(anti-men) moments sprinkled throughout, makes this an absolute crap movie.
Though Fury and Goose was charming, and the twist for the Skrulls were cool.
But overall it lacked heart in the plot, Carol was hella boring and generic.
Btw.. She was blasted with a engine pre-charged by the Space Stone, becoming the most powerful in MCU, whereas Vision literally has an infinity stone in his head, Strange with the Time Stone, and Scarlet Witch channelling the energy of infinity stones, all that.. Still no match to the might of feminism powering Captain Marvel.",6,3,6,14 April 2019
Aquaman," DC rebirth, literally.
","First of all, nice casting choice, no one could've made Aquaman cooler than Jason Mamoa and Mera sexier than Amber Heard (Patrick Wilson is here! are you surprised? It's a James Wan movie) Nice use of comedy though it's only worth a chuckle. The story is safe but solid, nothing unexpected but nothing horrible and quite touching to be honest. The effects are great, if you'd seen the first trailer, the effects were only tolerable, but now with the effects all done, it is enchanting! The colors are very vibrant (DC is taking notes from Marvel) and everything just looked beautiful. The credit song 'Everything you are' by Skylar Grey is very good. (so good that I sat through all the credits)",8,0,0,15 January 2019
Doctor Strange," Not strange enough, Dr. Strange.
","For a Marvel film, this is one of the weaker ones. Both Benedicts are great actors, the visuals are also great (though not as colourful as I would've liked) but the problem lies with the story...
The plot is not even bad, but it wants to do funny; it wants to do strange; it wants to explore the characters in an emotional level; it wants to have a theme of 'time'...... But none of them are done well.
Personally, I would've liked a stranger movie with even weirder effects including a consistent theme with 'time'. And showcase how much more of a human training in the mystic arts has made him.",6,2,2,25 January 2019
Interstellar," How dafuq do you write a movie like that?
","This movie is so well done, best I've seen.
Nuff said. Just go watch it.",10,0,0,27 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Best Spider-man movie, perhaps even best Superhero movie
","This movie just felt like our favorite wall-crawler more than any other adaptations, it captured the essence of Spider-man. With the help of the unique animation style and over-exaggerated character design, it created a Spider-verse that truly feels genuine, lived in. Voice acting and background music was very well handled, there are a couple scenes that actually got me to tear up (which I never do) The Easter-eggs are fun and a lot of things you will miss, if you know your comics, then you will be rewarded with a lot of references. The credit scene is magical and the end-credit scene is ten out of ten. Soundtrack is great, not to mention the writing, able to present so much obstacle and so many things changed because of these obstacles, connecting or reference back to scenes or things that specific character did earlier in the film.",10,1,3,15 January 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Promising start of a new era!
","The movie is magical, effects, designs are very well done, nostalgic atmosphere from the best Harry Potter films. The story has some twists and turns, but it does suffers from some pacing problems.
Overall, a good introduction to these new characters!",7,1,1,18 January 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Did not Disappoint!
","To be honest, with 10 years worth of movies backing this movie, it makes it hard for newcomers if this was your first movie, but the Russos did an amazing job on this movie 'yes it works!' Amazing color, actors, story(though doesn't follow the Infinity Gauntlet comics at all), design, BGM.
Every scene in this movie screams 'epic' !
Nuff said. Pretty sure everyone has seen it by now...",9,0,3,18 January 2019
Get Out," Really Well Done
","I will say this, its more of a social commentary than a horror movie. Everything so compact, well-written. The allegories and symbolism are so well-thought-out.",8,1,5,9 July 2019
Aladdin," Best live action Disney flick yet?!
","I wasn't even going to see this movie, because I didn't love Aladdin as a kid. But this surprised me, it was literally, a 'magic carpet ride'! Jasmine's new song 'Speechless' is the best original song, and could arguably be better than 'a whole new world'.
Naomi Scott as Jasmine is just amazing and her great singing is just the cherry on top.
All things considered, this is a magical movie and would definitely watch again!",8,0,3,9 July 2019
The Witch," Really well done
","Great commitment on the director's part, though for non-fluent English speakers, its quite hard to decipher. Otherwise, the movie is great, the music in particular.",7,1,4,9 July 2019
Wonder Woman," Best adaptaion of Wonderwoman.
","Gal Gadot is the perfect actress for this role, the movie is well paced, with a well composed theme song. Eventhough they greatly nerfed her character power, the movie has thrilling action and the Amazonian goddess is well represented. Though I admit, it was still a little to groomy and dark for the tone for my taste.
Generally, a very safe movie if you just want to enjoy something.",7,13,24,26 January 2019
The Martian," Mars Cast Away?
","Great character arc, solid story, simple setting, good acting.
Overall solid movie with some 'Cast Away' vibes and will have you on the edge of the seat. (Though just from watching the trailer, I kind of thought that there would be aliens) Realistic sci-fi are quite rare these days, so the visuals and color in this movie seem new and unique.
A movie that everyone can enjoy.",7,0,0,25 January 2019
