Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas Arts and Film makes even more money...
","The original Star Wars Series came out, and made bundles of money.Then the THX Revised edition of tapes came out, and were advertised as being available for the 'last time'. I bought the original tapes. Lucas makes bundles of money.4 Months later (After my purchase) the 'Special Edition' is released...with new scenes and further cleaned up. Lucas makes bundles of money again. (So much for the tapes being available for 'the last time')Along comes the Phantom Menace....with glaring inconsistencies with the original Trilogy. The movie itself was great, but not as a prequel to the original trilogy. If it had been presented as a parallel story...sure, but it hasn't. I feel betrayed, that Lucas is writing in situations and events with no regard for his original vision.Consider the midichlorians, not once are they mentioned in the original trilogy. Considering that Ben Kinobi is present in The Phantom Menace, and presumably survives through to feature in A New Hope, what happens? Why doesn't he test Luke for midichlorian presence?Lucas went off the rails here. These prequels were meant to have been in mind at the time of the original trilogy, but this is obviously not so.",2,0,1,20 July 2001
