The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Weakest of the three!!
","They just ruined the whole series when they decided to break mocking jay into 2 parts. The whole money-making idea totally devastated it. This movie had such high expectations, but very little to offer.If you have seen the trailer of this movie, trust me you have probably watched the whole movie. It drags along the scenes of JL being sentimental and more motivated for the cause, forcing to develop her character into the rebellion but pathetically failed. At times you feel that Katniss' character was forced to be made a symbol of rebellion when so many other characters could do better.The movie starts off slow and ends at the same pace. The only thing that saved it from more blushes is Francis Lawrence...what a great director! Background score is as bad as the plot of this movie. You end up thinking what really happened, what has changed and come up with actually NILL.Acting and Direction are good, and this movie will run good because of its fan-following, but totally lacked depth in the storyline. You are forced to think: what was the whole point??Guess they just left everything for the next movie to do some justice. As the 1st two parts were really good, this was a step backwards.",2,21,39,23 November 2014
Interstellar," An Amazing Film!!
","Forget all the critics. Forget what other people think or say about it. Do yourself a favor and go & watch this. A truly beautiful film in every aspect. Nolan has taken the sci-fi genre to a whole new level. Spare yourself from frivolous comparisons with 2001 or other films. Just appreciate the beauty of the very meticulous work Nolan has done.I won't deny there are some plot holes, but name one movie which doesn't (except godfather perhaps). Just relax and enjoy this masterpiece as it takes you to a completely different realm, just like Gravity or 2001.Cinematography - 10/10 Music - 11/10 (better than orgasms maybe) Story and screenplay, direction - 9/10 Acting - 9/10 what else do you want?After watching the film, you will have many questions, just like in all other Nolan films. Go and do some research on what theories and concepts Nolan used in the film. Idiots who call this a stupid movie have completely failed to grasp the basic essence of the movie. Yes. there are some plot holes, but overtaken by the grandiosity of basic concept.Some of the scenes were so epic...so strong. this is probably Nolan's most ambitious effort to date (i think TDK and memento were his best). Not giving anything away about the story line, but this movie has so many different aspects. It involves you in every way, as a family person, as a human being, as an explorer. Just go and watch this movie.",10,3,13,18 November 2014
Silence," In Silence you will see the answer
","If you are wanting to go and watch a movie with twists and climaxes, some intense suspense thriller scenes or amazing soundtrack...then this is not the movie you wanna watch. This movie is less about itself and more about the basic concept it revolves around...how strong is your faith? I believe the story line was linear yet satisfying in the end. I must say, the ending and the lesson we learn from it, is definitely satisfying. Direction overall is good. I wouldn't say spectacular but its definitely worth appreciation. I thought initially the movie was taking shortcuts to get to the main story line of the priests chasing their mentor. but then it stabilizes itself and moves on at a decent pace. Andrew Garfield did a really good job in acting. Overall! I would give it an 8. I would recommend it to everyone to at least watch it once.",8,8,18,15 January 2017
