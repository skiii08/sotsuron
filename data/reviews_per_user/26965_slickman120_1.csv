United 93," Please, see this film. You'll cry like a baby.
","Last Sunday, two days ago, my mother asked me if I wanted to see a movie. The only thing I wanted to watch was United 93, or I have choices such as RV and Stick It, heh, you get the point. So I went in thinking, yeah I might cry a bit, but given the critical acclaim, I knew I'd at least enjoy the film for what it was. 30 Min. into the film I noticed the superb acting, very impressed by people I've never seen on the silver screen acting better than almost all the 20 mil. actors out there. That point within itself should bring realism and this further more immersed my attention to become lost in its greatness. Yes, greatness. When the footage of the plane hitting the towers flashed before my eyes, I couldn't hold my tears in for the life of me. Greengrass' flow and suspense really pulls in the audience, grabbing them by the neck with emotion and immersion, never letting go. The acting, the camera work, the writing, everything was done with no flaw what-so-ever. By the end of the film, I couldn't take it; I was bawling like a baby, I've never cried like this before to a film, much less even in my entire life. I felt as if I was on board that very plain. No exaggeration at all. If a 20 year old man (me) who stereotypically would never show his weak side, considering I barely cry, cried so hard the entire theatre heard me. I had to go through the back exit so people wouldn't stare. I continued to cry until half way home. My mom had to drive my own car cuz I was so cut up. Now, with that said, I learned something. In the past I THOUGHT I felt for the passengers and families, but after experiencing this film, I KNOW, KNOW what the meaning of Don't ever forget 9/11 was truly about. OK, I admit the very first time I saw the trailer, like everyone else, felt it was too soon. But that's the point, nobody felt this way for Pearl Harbor, even the people who lived through it, given it was a weak film; I was still something people could emotionally relate to. Please people, the only reason you shouldn't see this film in the theatre is because of a soft heart. This film was made with dignity, made with care and attention to detail, with out the goal of making a profit. That is definitely something 99.9% of Hollywood filmmakers can't say. Greengrass can. One last point, I'm an avid film maker and I've seen a great amount of films in my life, lots, and this is by far on of the greatest film experiences I have ever had in my entire life. Please go see this film before it's too late...",10,4,10,1 May 2006
