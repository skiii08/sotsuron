First Man," Incredible
","'First Man' is incredible. The main complaint I see is that 'It's boring' and 'They made space exploration boring' and those people were probably expecting this movie to be something like Star Wars. First Man is a very slow movie that the average viewer may not be able to sit through. Ryan Gosling's acting is excellent and conveys a very realistic character in Neil Armstrong, who this movie is completely about. This movie isn't about the NASA mission or how we got to the moon; it's about Neil and it's all from his perspective. We see Neil's tragedies, his accomplishments. The music is incredible when it does play since a lot of the movie is quiet (for good reason). The moon landing scene is spectacular and you feel so much for Neil Armstrong and you feel like you are on the moon yourself. The main thing this movie suffers I believe (and it's a nitpick) is the characterization of Buzz Aldrin, who feels like an extra with occasional lines in the movie. He jokes about things that aren't funny in the movie and he becomes kind of unlikable, which I'm not sure if the real Buzz Aldrin was like that, but you don't care about him very much, which isn't good since he was the second man on the moon. As a movie that focuses on Neil Armstrong and his feelings alone; it's excellent. It's slow which is nice since it makes it so much more of an experience, rather than a quick action blockbuster. This movie is incredible and if you think it's boring then it's just not a movie for you; it doesn't mean it's bad, it's out of this world.",10,1,3,28 February 2019
It," Entertaining, but nothing much.
","A good horror picture with excellent music, brilliant acting from the main cast who make it all the more believable. The film is boggled down by constant jump-scares, mainly by the character of Pennywise portrayed amazingly by Bill Skarsg√•rd, who makes the character terrifying and his own. The story is very interesting and you can always follow along, with the brilliant writing and characters.",7,0,0,26 February 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Fantastic spinoff
","Gareth Edward's entry into the Star Wars universe with his spin-off 'Rogue One' is a bold move, getting rid of the Skywalker family completely. In place of them are a group of unmemorable characters who are an exciting story filled with many callbacks and use of nostalgia. 'Rogue One' is a very good Star Wars film, with an exciting score by Michael Giacchino, and a creative fun 'Saving Private Ryan' take on Star Wars, showing the war aspect of the saga. The comedy in this film works with the main cast and the fight scenes are very well done, and the acting is very good among most of the main cast. The only fault I see with this installment is the lack of reason to care for any of the main characters other than our main heroine. The film introduces these characters very quickly and gives them a quick sad story. It will be difficult to walk away from this film saying that you remembered all of the main characters names. However this is a stand-alone, regardless still manages to be a fun Star Wars flick.",8,5,7,26 February 2019
12 Angry Men," A classic
","A complete classic that stands the test of time. Extremely well written with giving us a group of 12 men who are in a court case and are the ones who will decide the fate of a young man who was put on trial for a murder it seems very obvious he committed, but over the course of the movie more information is uncovered showing whether he truly did it or not. Great dialogue that gives you an insight into these characters without showing you any of their backstory, fun back and forth talk between characters. You feel enclosed in the room the characters are in since the majority of the movie takes place in one small room, but it completely works, this movie is essentially perfect, high recommend.",10,1,1,28 February 2019
Deadpool 2," More or less the same as the first one.
","Deadpool 2 is a very fun action movie, which is all it needed to be. This movie isn't better nor worse than the original, it is just as good, which is fine. This movie has incredible humor. with some amazing jokes and many many references. This movie also has some great action since the director of John Wick is behind it. Lot of fourth wall breaking, and even a great score from Tyler Bates. It's everything you could ever want from a Deadpool movie! Where this movie sort of loses me, and it's a nitpick, is when it becomes sad, yes a Deadpool movie has some depressing moments, and it's understandable, but I didn't really come to a Deadpool movie to see dark imagery and sad scenes, I came to have complete fun. However that is a nitpick for this movie is still great, Cable is a standout played beautifully by Josh Brolin; yet he is very underused and not used to his full potential. If you worried about the trailers showing you an Avengers like team up with Deadpool leading them, you have nothing to be concerned about since its nothing like that, it's still a fun Deadpool film. Deadpool doesn't really do anything 'bad-ass' in this film, he's very funny but doesn't do anything that stands out really. A very excellent entry to the Deadpool franchise, but by the end of it, I wasn't asking for a Deadpool 3, not because I didn't want one, but because this movie feels like a conclusion for his story.",7,1,1,28 February 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," A great Thor film!
","'Thor Ragnarok' is the third Thor movie, and it's a great Thor film, arguable the best. The serious tone of the previous 2 films are disregarded in favor of a more comedic 'Guardians of the Galaxy' style. Thankfully this movie still feels like Thor and actually concludes the trilogy with Thor and Loki's relationship wrapping up in this one and giving a satisfying conclusion to the brothers arc. This movie gives a really good version of the Hulk who is very fun. This movie is overall just fun and that's all it really needed. The villain in this film is Hela who is a fun villain but like most of the Marvel villains, she is quite lackluster and dull. The scenes where Thor is on Sakaar are the best scenes in the movie, but the scenes on Asgard are quite dull and you don't want to stay there for long. The comedy is excellent and it's on of the funniest Marvel movies ever. It's villain is generic, it's plot is straightforward, the chemistry between actors is what helps this movie get off the ground, the fight scenes are brilliant. and the acting is spectacular. Highly recommend this one.",8,2,4,28 February 2019
Pan's Labyrinth," Amazing!
","I wasn't sure about the background of this film, so I had a great viewing experience. This movie is fantastic, very well written, such a fun blend between sci-fi and a real-life war going on, a very interesting premise. Well written, well acted, beautiful cinematography, and direction from Guillermo Del Toro. Even with subtitles I enjoyed this film very much. My only complaint if any, is the ending feels ridiculous, and sometimes when you go from sci-fi to a real gritty war, it feels off-putting. However a fantastic flick for all!",9,0,0,28 February 2019
Suicide Squad," A dumpster fire
","The beginning of the DCEU attempting to be like Marvel, most comparable to 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. This film feels truly amateur, with the lighting sometimes being so dark you could barely see, to eye popping colors that feel out of place. The acting is as good as it can be with what the actors had to work with. The villain is not well set up at all, and the finale feels unsatisfying since it can be identically compared to 'The Amazing Spider-man', 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' and 'Teenage mutant ninja turtles (2014). This film is not unique in the slightest and is overall a very disappointing next step into this attempt at a cinematic universe.",1,0,1,28 February 2019
Justice League," Horrible
","Before we begin, this movie is horrible, there. Zack Snyder or Joss Whedon's 'Justice League' is the ultimate build up to the 6 heroes coming together, 3 of which were set up, the other 3 not at all. The characters relationships work, however that's the only thing that works in this dumpster fire. Aquaman is a bland character and is very unlikable anytime he is on screen, to make up for this he makes jokes that don't land and does some 'badass' stuff, like hitting the cgi villian Steppenwolf. Batman does a complete 360 and changes from a brooding dark basically murderous vigilante to a jokey Tony Stark type figure. It doesn't help that Ben Affleck looks barely awake throughout the course of this film. Wonder Woman is just as boring and 1 dimensional as she was in 2016's 'Dawn of Justice' with only her solo movie providing any reason to care, the countless references to Steve Trevor annoyingly remind us that we could be watching a better movie. Ezra Miller's the Flash is an attempt to recreate essentially Spider-man, removing any intelligence that the character previously had, in place for a quirky, constantly messing up Flash, purely for comedic relief. Cyborg is bland and one of the few interesting characters that the movie refuses to explore. The film has awful writing with jokes that almost never land, and a plot that is so generic and straightforward that it just makes you realize the best thing about this movie. It's so straightforward and generic that you can watch it as just a dumb superhero popcorn flick. This film is unintentionally funny, and looks ugly compared to Snyder's usual beautiful style, the CGI is awful with some shots I can compare to that of the Injustice games and the main villain Steppenwolf who appears as a PlayStation character. The effects are awful, references to Wonder Woman that are shoehorned in, no consistency in this cinematic universe, and a film ugly to look at. However this film is dumb-fun and feels like a Saturday morning cartoon special and I had fun watching it.",3,2,12,22 March 2019
Man of Steel," All style no substance.
","Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is a cluster. It is filled with so much punching and destruction that it becomes a complete blockbuster and a movie that needs to be good for IMAX. Seriously Superman's dad dies in a massive tornado for no reason. There is so much destruction and awful shots that it makes the movie look ugly sometimes. Some scenes like Superman's first flight are great and Han Zimmer's score only makes it more exciting. Clustered boring story that is hard to understand, unnecessary action, beautiful shots and music. However I left this movie bored and feeling like I just watched a Dark Knight ripoff.",4,0,3,28 February 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," An entertaining interesting flick!
",A very well acted drama that makes you feel these characters are real. A very satisfying film filled with an interesting plot and interesting characters. Highly recommend if you could maintain your interest since this film would be considered 'boring' to the average viewer.,9,0,0,28 February 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," It ain't bad
","It's a good movie, I recommend it. It really does nothing new with the Spider-man character but its a fun watch. Andrew Garfield fits into the role of Spider-man perfectly, but struggles to become Peter Parker; since Andrew Garfield does not have that same boyish charm Tobey Maguire had, he is not a nerd and you never believe it. The villain is pretty good, very over the top, but in the first 40 minutes he's interesting and unique, until he isn't. The villain is the lizard and seeing him fighting Spider-man is fun. The music is acceptable, it gives Spider-man a nice theme you can hum and the movie is quite inspiring. The end fight is very fun to watch and if you invest in the characters enough, you can feel some emotion in the end. Gwen Stacy is an excellent character and has great chemistry with Peter Parker. The origin story is kinda fascinating until you realize it's a more dumb downed version of the Raimi origin story. Uncle Ben literally says 'with great power comes great responsibility' but he couldn't say that exactly because then people would accuse it of being too similar, instead he says 'Your father had a philosophy, that if you could do good things for other people, you would've had a moral obligation to do those things. that's whats at stake, not choice....Responsibility' such a dumb downed speech. Excellent special effects and sometimes does feel like an attempt to 'Dark knight' Spider-man but regardless of that it's a very fun movie and I highly recommend watching it but don't try to compare it with the original because then it won't be fun.",7,4,5,26 February 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Not bad, not good.
","This film isn't bad, nor do I think it's very good. The acting is okay, despite Eddie Redmayne mumbling most of his dialogue and not being understandable often. The cast is likable. Ezra Miller is extremely out of place in this movie. There's no consistent tone, sometimes Director David Yates makes it a fun magical movie about animals, and them sometimes it's an abusive dark sad story. J.K Rowling isn't a screenwriter and it shows, this film focusing on the small details of characters instead of giving a good story for a film. The story is inconsistent and uninteresting. The visuals are occasionally bleak, which isn't shocking for Yates, but for the most part it's a good looking movie. The music is fantastic. I would recommend this to a die hard Wizarding World fan, but ultimately it feels like a cash grab.",6,0,0,28 February 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," The best video game movie ever!
","Wreck it Ralph is an original story that had heart, and is extremely fun to watch. Fantastic music,voice acting, creativity, animation. This film is entirely re watchable and it gets better every viewing! Seeing Ralph exploring other games that seem out of place for the kind of character he was programmed to be gives this movie more creativity than expected. A fantastic animated movie.",10,1,1,28 February 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Mindblowing
","'Avengers: Infinity War' is the culmination of most of the heroes of the Marvel cinematic universe, and it's a very good movie. Thanos is a terrifying villain which you dread seeing because you know once you see him, something bad is going to happen and there will be major consequences. Groups are split up and sent on different missions but are all for the same goal. The characters we know and love aren't really developed anymore considering they've already been developed before, but the most development comes in Thanos who for a CG character who is trying to murder half the universe, is a sympathetic character who thinks he's right. The acting is brilliant, standout being Josh Brolin as Thanos who makes the character feel real. The visual effects are mind-blowing as everything feels so real, it should feel goofy and ridiculous but it isn't. The music is decent but nothing mind-blowing the Avengers theme is a nice touch to hear often. The movie sometimes struggles in terms of cutting back and forth between many characters. It is a nitpick as it basically juggles all the characters perfectly. Expectations are subverted, all your awful theories are wrong as Marvel is very creative and utilizes it's advantage in having many movies before this one. It was worth the 10 year wait.",9,0,3,26 February 2019
A Quiet Place," Effectivr
","John Krasinski presents a spectacular thrill of a horror film, 'A Quiet Place' is an excellent film. The acting is brilliant and very believable, the monsters are terrifying and whenever anyone makes any noise, you shiver up and get scared when you aren't sure whats going to happen. The music is a nice touch when it does play, but what truly makes the film great is the silence, you feel uncomfortable eating your popcorn while watching because it's so quiet, the visuals are stunning seeing how the family has been surviving this creature. The only time the film boggles down is when the monster is fully revealed, you fear the monster the most when you aren't sure what it looks like. The monster is so fast you aren't sure what it looks like but you know it's big and fast which makes it terrifying. Seeing the monster in full frame as it's just standing there makes it less scary and more of a CG monster, however that doesn't happen until the latter half of the film. Everything up until the end is perfect, the ending feels a bit goofy, but even with that this film works and is a very good horror film.",8,1,1,26 February 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Interestingly terrible
","Director Marc Webb is not the one to blame for this travesty of a superhero flick, nor is Andrew Garfield, I blame Sony for their awful attempts at a cinematic universe, and their constant product placement where I played a game of pointing out how many Sony products there were. The story is lackluster, and has so many plot-points that are either dropped, or go nowhere. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Spider-man is much more lighthearted and fun but confusing on his motivations. The story continues from the also dropped plot points of the first Amazing Spider-man movie and does nothing satisfying nor entertaining with it. Jamie Fox's Electro is the only fun part, he tries his best with the dumb cartoonish character he is given. The green goblin is a wasted villain who only exists to be put on the poster, as with Rhino who is awful and cartoony in this film. The music is awful, Hanz Zimmer doesn't seem like he put any effort into the score, and Pharell Williams puts out of place songs everywhere. The special effects are amazing with the Spider-man web slinging shots looking the most realistic, and are overall fun. The plot is dumb, the writing is atrocious, but it's the best looking Spider-man movie ever made. This film has a little bit of style, but no substance. If you're a die-hard Spider-man fan, than just turn your brain off, or watch it out of curiosity.",5,0,3,26 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Stellar
","An excellent entry in the ever growing Star Wars saga by writer/director Rian Johnson, who manages to create the most beautiful shots in a Star Wars movie and is able to write a very interesting plot about what happened to the characters of the sequel trilogy while honoring the veterans that came before it. Brilliant music by John Williams improving on his previous 'Force Awakens' soundtrack. Brilliant performances from the entire cast, Adam Driver and Mark Hamill standing out as the best. The film pays respects to the legacy of the original trio and pushes them in an unexpected direction that fans who are open to change will be eager to see. Not without its problems the film is boggled down by Canto Bight scenes, not by the ideas, but by the execution. Rian Johnson is able to create excellent ideas but sometimes struggles to execute them well.",9,5,32,26 February 2019
Jurassic World," Meh?
","Colin Terverrow's, 'Jurassic World' is a wasted opportunity. By all means the film isn't bad, just okay. The story feels like a retread of the first 3 movies, and hardly anything original is done in this flick. The acting is very good and the characters are extremely likable which Trevorrow is very good at, creating likable characters. Christ Pratt is a modern day Indiana Jones in this flick, he is very good and very fun. Bryce Dallas Howard is a lot of fun as well. The newcomer children actors are watchable until the 'divorce' subplot is introduced randomly. The music is excellent by Michael Giacchino, the new John Williams. The dinosaurs are fun for the first half when they are just being shown off, but become nonsensical in the films final battle. Far too many references to the original Jurassic Park, great acting, an annoying divorce subplot and a pointless military subplot, fun humor, nice visuals, a lackluster story. The die hard Jurassic Park fans will praise it, but the average movie goer can still have fun with this one. I do recommend this one",6,1,2,28 February 2019
The Disaster Artist," A love letter to The Room
","An excellent film by director James Franco. It truly feels like a love letter to 'The Room' and not an attempt to cash-in on it's success. James Franco's portrayal of the odd ball Tommy Wiseau is very believable, he gives a very good amount of heart to the character, never making fun of him. Though Dave Franco does not look like Greg Sestero he gives a spectacular performance and makes you believe in his embodiment of Sestero by the end of the film. A very good love letter that any fan of 'The Room' or any fan of watching the making of a film; can enjoy.",7,0,0,26 February 2019
Steve Jobs," Amazing
","The Steve Jobs biopic that we deserved. This film feels like the perfect 3 act play, seeing Jobs as a young man then middle age, then in his elder years. Michael Fassbender may not look like Jobs but he excels in his performance and even knocks his voice out of the park. Danny Boyle's directing style is very visible, with the camera that was used to film even changing over the years in Jobs life. Seth Rogen is very good as Woz, one of the best performances of his career. The supporting cast are all excellent and Fassbender being the obvious standout seamlessly becomes Jobs and gives us a man who's not perfect, who doesn't know computers, yet is very smart. Story was always engaging, excellent music, beautiful cinematography. A perfect biopic, highly recommend.",9,0,1,26 February 2019
Finding Dory," Brilliant!
","Another brilliant Pixar movie. Incredible animation, excellent voice acting. However a nitpick towards the Nemo voice actor, obviously its a different kid voicing him but its too noticeably different but it really doesn;t matter. Pixar takes on a character that wasn't really interesting in the original finding Nemo, and makes something pretty great. The movie has an emotional story line and manages to make Dory likable and slightly interesting. The main problem with this movie is that it's just another Pixar movie, it's really nothing unique, there's no tension, there's a scene involving a chase with Marlon and Dory and it mirrors the original chase with the angler-fish in the original Finding Nemo except it has no tension. You never feel like anything is going to happen to these characters and it makes it tension-less. The movie makes up for that however by being fun, and it does not feel incredibly long, it feels quite short. The plot is quite simple but heartwarming with some fantastic music at the end. Overall the movie is very well made highly recommend, it just feels like another Pixar movie, not what could've potentially been done with a Finding Nemo sequel.",8,1,2,28 February 2019
Wonder Woman," Fine.
","Patty Jenkins's 'Wonder Woman' is a decent film. It has the disadvantage of being associated with the other films of the DCEU, and that is a shame since the film is quite excellent, there's actually a story that keeps you interested. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman varies between good character to confusing character, but Gadot makes the character her own and by the end of the film you will not be able to see anyone as Wonder Woman but Gadot. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor made the film feel grounded and gave a lot of heart to it, watching him and Gadot have scenes where its just banter and is probably improvised make the movie great. The music is alright and fits the standard for okay superhero movie music, not relying 100% on ZImmer and JunkieXL's music only when it needs to, and that makes it great, showing that they won't rely simply off of 'badass' music. The villain and the big twist towards the end is very weak and makes for an awful final fight similar to the doomsday fight in 'Dawn of Justice'. The final fight and the special effects are what bring this movie down. The special effects in this film are awful, obvious green screen during combat and reused shots of Gadot leaping in the air. The cgi is awful and very noticeable. The big 'twist' is equivalent to picking the background character as the villain. Of course you would be shocked but the film never even hinted at it and the final villain could've been anyone. This film presents an excellent female lead for young children to look up to, and is a very inspirational film with a lot of heart. The film overall is fun and a step in the right direction for DC.",6,0,0,26 February 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Beautiful trash
","A truly awful second film to continue the DCEU with. Zack Snyder is a visual director and the visuals in this film are truly beautiful surpassing Snyder's previous 'Man of Steel'. The effects mostly through the second half of the film are truly awful, as the final villain Doomsday looks like a failed ninja turtle. The story attempts to present itself as 'Deep' but ultimately just doesn't make sense and is not executed well. Ben Affleck makes an excellent Batman and makes the character unique and his own in this interpretation, while Henry Cavill struggles as Superman to find good direction as his character barely says anything throughout the picture and is not an interesting hero to follow. The villain is extremely weak in that of Doomsday being a giant Cg mess and Jessie Eisenberg makes for an awful Lex Luthor channeling the character into a 'Joker' type villain. Attempting to set up the entire Justice League into this movie makes it feel like another 'Iron Man 2' except it's not fun. The action is lackluster when there even is action, and the final fight is meaningless as it is just punching. The score by Hanz Zimmer and JunkieXL is excellent and makes for some memorable music. The music and visuals and Batman are essentially the only fun or interesting aspects of this movie, whether that makes the movie intriguing enough for you to see it is up to you, but it is truly a disaster of a film.",5,2,5,26 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An incredible return to the Skywalker saga
","J.J Abrams's return to a galaxy far far away is a pleasant one with 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. Returning the beloved characters of the Skywalker saga and showing what happened to them.The visuals are beautiful as is John Williams score, the brilliant performances also help with Harrison Ford fully channeling Han Solo, and not a grizzled Harrison Ford. The newcomers are very good as well with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. The largest complaint I could even have with this film is the fact that despite the over 30 year wait for an Episode VII we get something very familiar, which is obviously intentional to bring back the feeling of Star Wars to fans, however the film becomes predictable once you see the formula, the film is still fun, and does have new ideas but overall you see the similarities. Despite being a very familiar film, it is heavily filled with fun nostalgia and a Star Wars movie that will leave you feeling like you're a kid again.",9,7,27,26 February 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Amazing end to a series
","The absolute greatest finale to a series ever. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great film. Fantastic acting, visuals, story. It brings satisfaction and a reward to those who stuck with this series till the end. The finale is very satisfying. The music is fantastic, and the characters are extremely likable. A finale that is both sad and fantastic, if you cry during any portion of it, I don't blame you. Can't recommend more.",10,0,0,28 February 2019
Incredibles 2," Excellent!
","An excellent Pixar film, and a great sequel to the Incredibles. While it doesn't surpass the original, it is right beside it. Somehow after so many years this movie continues the same story-line and even small subplots from the original and manages to have the same tone and feeling. The animation improvement and higher budget is well utilized and noticeable. This film has heart thanks to Brad Bird's excellent writing and directing. The villain is standard but the best aspect of the film is when the family just behaves like a family. The voice actors are great as it does feel like a direct continuation of the original, Dash is the only character with a voice actor change, and you wouldn't even notice. The score is excellent by Michael Giacchino. This movie is great and I could not recommend it more.",8,2,2,28 February 2019
