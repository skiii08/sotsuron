Saturday Night Fever," Travolta's breakthrough
","Saturday Night Fever is a movie from the disco era. At the same time it tells about disco culture and life of 70's young adults. The movie plays many classics of disco music and presents dance movements of its time. John Travolta makes the final breakthrough in Hollywood with the main role. Travolta plays American-Italian Tony who lives in New York with his family in modest conditions. His family is catholic and conservative and his parents don't like Tony's dancing in discos on Fridays. He has some close friends with him at the disco every time. I think the movie is underrated but not perfect. The movie contain some unbelievable scenes like the final scene but I still like this movie a lot. It is very entertaining and characters are interesting. On the other hand Saturday Night Fever is a time window to the disco era. Above all, this is Travolta's best movie and I recommend this movie to everyone. 8/10",8,0,1,11 October 2019
Wind River," Taylor Sheridan quality
","I think Neo-Westerns are often underrated. Wind River is better than most of movies I've seen. The main actors are Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen.The hunter (Renner) finds a dead and raped young Indian women in the forrest. The urban FBI agent (Olsen) comes to investigate the case. Other characters are the local tribal polices and residents of the Indian Reserve.Movie themes are problems of the Indian Reserve: drugs, alcohol, poor conditions, rapes and low law enforcement. Grief is also a visible theme. The movie contains suitably action scenes and wilderness culture. Indian traditions are trying to maintain like hunting and connection to nature. Western values like honor, coping with harsh life and your own right are present.Profound story and successful direction are the most important reasons for grade. 9/10",9,0,0,13 January 2020
Home Alone," This movie brings Christmas!
","Home Alone is a familiar movie from childhood. I was surprised how good that still is. I last saw this movie about 15 years ago. Home Alone is still as fun as it was then before unlike some other movies of childhood.
A main character is Kevin MacCallister (Culkin) who is a wild boy of a large family. He is accidentally left home when the rest of the family has gone to Paris for the christmas vacation. Two other important characters are Harry (Pesci) and Marv (Stern) who are criminals. The are going to rob valuable goods of houses which are empty during Christmas. They don't know Kevin is still at home. Kevin protects home from the burglars while these try to rob his family's house too. Movie contains some emotional moments along comedic scenes.
Culkin, Pesci and Stern are very good in this movie. I think this is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen.
