Ford v Ferrari," Still Ford doesn't make great cars
","Ken miles acts pretty good. Carrol Shelby acts soso. A little biased. Guess American made a movie because they seldomly win races. Also, ugly Ford executives.",6,1,2,28 March 2020
John Wick," Cliche action movie
","Lost wife and dog, killing, revenging, and going on forever",5,0,3,13 October 2019
Se7en," Typical thriller in 90s
","Detective, homicide, crime, etc. that was hot topics in that time period. Brad was young and acted bad back then.",6,2,4,29 September 2019
Full Metal Jacket," Horrible movie
",The movie starts with meaningless shouting between officer and soldiers. Trying to say this is military life. Naive. Half of the movie is training. The other half is war scene but is so fake almost like stage play. The movie ends with killing sniper. They think this is insightful. I don't think so.,3,2,8,27 October 2019
Baby Driver," So fake
",The story is unrealistic and acting is artificial.,3,3,8,7 October 2019

",The movie is so slow paced and hard to understand what it trying to say.,4,1,12,30 October 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fun and engaging
","Not much of storyline or thought provoking movie, but it is hilarious to watch teenagers doing silly things. Video gamification of the movie is also kind of novel.",7,0,0,9 October 2019
Cold War," very artistic
","Beautiful piano and songs, plus black and white theme, quite unique.",7,0,0,13 January 2020
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Long, boring, and always shouting
","Fast forward 4x. Always loud shouting is annoying for watching thus movie. To make intense atmosphere, the director doesn't have to make actors shouting from beginning to the end.",5,0,3,8 December 2019
All Quiet on the Western Front," Slow and long movie
",Couldn't have patient to watch all movie. So slow paced that even fast forward 4x speed won't miss a frame. Guess that's 1920s style.,2,1,8,29 September 2019
Joker," Don't know what the movie trying to convey
",Everyone should riot and be violent? The actor's skill isn't that great. Just laugh. Anyone can do that. Joker nominated for Academy award is a joke.,6,7,12,14 January 2020
The Green Mile," Great story and acting
",Great story. Perfect movie shooting techniques. Actors are great fit for the roles. Great movies.,8,0,1,21 October 2019
Parasite," expected and unexpected
",I realized that the family's plot to replace all employees of the rich family when they plan to replace the driver. So the rest of movie is expected. Then the basement secret is really a surprise. Wish the ending can be more touching. Parasite: is the poor family or the rich family?,7,0,4,30 January 2020
Blade Runner," amazing special effect
",Mediocre acting and story line. But pretty amazing special (image/sound) effect considering the technologies in 1980's.,6,0,5,5 October 2019
The Greatest Showman," Nice acting
","Cliche screenwriting, not so great musicals and singing, but acting is not bad.",7,2,2,18 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Funny yet silly movie
",Not a 'formal' movie or thoughtful plot. No new knowledge. A little low and silly. But it is funny and nice entertainment made by American.,6,0,1,4 April 2020
Midway," So so movie
","A bunch of inexperienced actors/actresses. No main character. Meaningless conversations and scripts. Can't feel the deep emotion. Rather than letting you feel it, the director just let actor speak out naively as if you are low IQ. The movie is called Midway. Half of the movie is about Pearl Harbor. Good visual effect though. Typical Chinese produced movies.",5,4,6,6 March 2020
