United 93," Outstanding!
","This is an outstanding movie, certainly one of the very best I have ever seen! Although we know the eventual outcome, the movie is an edge-of-your-seat nail-biting thriller. The important message is that this is not simply a tale of sacrifice. Enough time had elapsed that the passengers were able to learn what was in store for them if they did not act. Those Americans processed the information they had available to them, formulated a plan, and carried it out with amazing courage and bravery. The intention of the passengers and crew was to take back the plane and to save their lives. That they were not ultimately successful in this endeavor makes the act no less courageous or admirable. What amazing people, those 'Ordinary' Americans!",10,5,12,1 May 2006
Zodiac," Historical accuracy and standout performances
","I absolutely loved this movie. I have followed this case with some interest for years and the attention to detail and accuracy was magnificent. Standout performances by Jake Gyllenhaal, Anthony Edwards (although I have trouble separating him from Dr. Green) and Robert Downey Jr. should be noted, as well as by Mark Ruffalo (an actor with whom I was not familiar). I appreciated the fact that not once does the movie descend into melodrama. Some of the early scenes are graphic and grisly, however, anything less would be to soft-pedal the horror. Although the major events occurred in the 1968-1972 time frame, work continues on this case, to this day. Recently, a partial DNA profile was obtained from one of the envelopes the killer sent. Running 2 hours and 40 minutes, the 'updates' are relegated to text in the trailer. Interesting, almost everyone in the theater stayed to read every word.",10,4,8,4 March 2007
