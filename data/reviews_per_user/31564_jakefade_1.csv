Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Entertaining enough
","It's a Sherlock Holmes movie and is exactly what you'd expect. The only thing I find strange is, what the hell is the point of Naomi Rapace' character? She's just this tertiary character in every scene for no effing reason whatsoever. No dialogue. Just the same dumb look on her face throughout the movie.",6,0,0,25 June 2020
