Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Sutured with care
","By some kind of miracle, 'Who Frammed Roger Rabbit' received a PG rating despite its very dark themes, segments of non-cartoonish violence, and prominent sexuality. This very fact made it hard for me to enjoy this well-crafted film-noir. But even if the film had received an appropriate rating, nothing would excuse its divergence from the supposed nature of cartoons in the film. The 'toons' are supposed to exist to make people laugh, but character Jessica Rabbit has grotesque features very much aimed toward her sexual parts, like she was conceived from some beyond help geekoid. Sure I remember the hilarious 'Little Red Riding Hood' shorts that involved a very frisky wolf, but Rabbit's character was emphasized so disturbingly beyond her importance as the femme fatale in this mock film-noir. I wasn't laughing. Still, there are very clever homages to the nature of 'toons' (and underlying tones that allude to racism and genocide) that make the film work. The toons are blended so realistically into the story, technically and thematically, that I will praise it for such. Loopy cartoons and 1940's film noir should be wholly analogous to each other, but here they work to a level that makes it feel like this genre has always existed. This idea does much favor to the film's aesthetic appeal, and the animation appears to be computer animated with its use of shadow, despite the dark tone coloring. It was certainly a technical achievement. I'm sure the film inspired future efforts of the odd mixing of defined groups of entertainment, 'Happy Feet', 'Space Jam' and 'Shrek' all come to mind, the latter being one of the better films in my opinion. So certainly, it is a big contribution to the animation medium.",9,2,2,19 May 2007
Kung Fu Panda," Kung Fu Panda
","The hard-headed folks at Dreamworks just won't back down when it comes to their consistent choice to produce only the animated genre of slapstick comedy despite constant unnecessary comparisons to Pixar by most audiences. Here however, I feel they've finally succeeded in forming a well-crafted comedy that references itself and its genre without any manipulative occurrences of incessant cute (despite featuring one of the universal symbols) or thin framework. One of the first cgi Dreamworks romps to lack pop culture (shockingly less than Pixar's Cars) the pacing in the film shines, as well as the slick camera work and surprisingly effective fight sequences. Particularly, there was a true sense of environment to the animation, but also a sense of peril and physical boundaries in the well choreographed combat scenes. The story is expectedly predictable as well as the clean message, but the film comes together as referential fun comedy with likable and moderately inspiring situations despite the nature of the film. There are no mean-spirited jokes, and just the right amount of heart are out into them (not too much or little) so that it begins to approach what made the first Shrek enjoyable. It makes great use of its animation, tying in it's comical pacing with a lot of great physicality. I thoroughly enjoyed the characterizations, barely noticing or caring that they typically come to us from cherry-picked A-list celebs in an attempt to drag in theatregoers. Despite that, they bring their A-game with voice work, and the audience besides the actors have fun for once. In my opinion, it's one of Dreamworks' best after they canned their 2d films. I did not see that coming, with the eye-roll inducing premise.",7,1,6,6 June 2008
Hostel," God help me, I kinda liked this
","*possible spoilers* OK OK, it's no masterpiece, that goes without saying. The claims about the film being borderline pornographic in the beginning...are true. I even joked to myself, thinking sarcastically 'I'm sure this will all have some relevance to the plot of the story'. Well as it turned out, it sorta did. It helps if you view it as a satirical piece. While watching it I was reminded of films like 'Audition' with a bit of humor thrown in the mix. There are times when you want to laugh at certain scenes in this film. There are even some people who assert that this is a 'comedy', in a sense. Unfortunately, the acting in this film is good, perhaps too good. Whatever laughs are delivered in this film are quickly eviscerated by the sheer pain you can feel these victims take, at least with normal people. There is still an odd 'light' feel to the movie's tone, however. What really ended up getting to me, was not the scenes that a number of people found shocking, but the fact that this film was based off of true events. It was quite blatant that the film was trying to make a statement, particularly with the shots of the hoar house in the beginning, and the 'museum' in the second half. And that's what I took the film for, an unmerciful delve into human exploitation, whether its sexploitation or torture perpetuated to fulfill a person's sick desires. The film then ended up transforming into a feel-good revenge flick toward the end, fortunately. Everyone loves a bit of vigilante justice. This is certainly a love it or hate film. Is there room in your tolerance level for a pornographic torture flick?",8,2,2,6 November 2006
Finding Nemo," Everyone Loves Nemo!
","Being a film that titillated female viewers, children, and even some men alike, 'Finding Nemo''s awe-inspiring animation and wonderful voice work may have caste the illusion that this well-made little film is something of a masterpiece. In reality, Nemo floats well, but there's not much beneath the surface, making it an enjoyable but over-hyped cgi flick.The film borrows heavily the pacing formula of the brilliant 'Toy Story', and that's not really a bad thing. What gives the film it's mass appeal is undoubtedly, aside from the stunning graphics, the characters. Although I couldn't really connect with them, I can see why so many enjoy watching them. Dorry is the conventional half-wit (Sid from Ice Age, Donkey from Shrek) who for no real reason other then for conventional cinematic interest, finds herself accompanying Marlin on his journey to locate his missing son out of the vast ocean. Just a small twist, she has short term memory loss. I comment frequently on the use of the suspension of disbelief. I don't usually have a problem with it, depending on the context and how often it's used. Here, the unreality of the film leaps out at me with it's teeth barred. Not everyone who boats lives by the shore, and even though Marlin was lucky enough to have his son's captor live so close to the ocean, just how was he planning on getting up there without the help of a winged sympathetic fish-a-vore? Still, the film has enough whimsy for that not to get too problematic, but it allows the writer a lot of area in creating the story, and I wasn't as impressed with the results as others, aside from the films sporadic strong points.Dorry is bubbly and fun for many to watch. Just like with the tepid 'Ice Age', it takes more then a character who's easy on the eyes and ears to become a character worthy of layering. She doesn't really improve or change much over the course of the film, she just occasionally in a very Disney-like fashion unintentionally helps Marlin escape some near fatal situations. Marlin has the task of forming a friendship with her, because she can grow a tad bit annoying. There's Nemo, who's blow up at his father seems rather unwarranted. I'd assume Nemo knows his siblings were killed by the hundreds, and I'd think he'd at least sympathize with his father for being so overprotective. He can still get upset, but to use the word 'hate'? And of course there's the tank gang, another hoot to watch (each having a cartoon personality), and the serious Gil.Back to the story, it's basically our heroes almost getting eaten, and nemo's attempts at an orthodontist's office to escape his aquatic prison. Some of the sequences succeed better the others. The film also revels in not demeaning animals who happen to be carnivorous, another plus. The film also quite well provides more then shallow entertainment for everyone, and I mean everyone. As long as you're not to young to watch a movie, 'Finding Nemo' is accessible. That's the film's strongest quality, but aside from that, it really isn't anything much more. Some of the emotion seems trite and ill-proportioned, moving back and forth from believable to not so much. Being a kid's flick, it certainly is better then many other films out there. It just doesn't tackle that much in order to be considered over so many other films, which is usually the case. The story is very linear and it doesn't amaze that well outside of itself. The animation not only delivers, it delivers a natural biome that in itself is one of the most amazing places on earth. The animation on the fish is glorious, capturing the realistic way in which real fish move and partnering it with comedic human movement. The animated reef with it's human makeover, however, is even more brighter and colorful then most actual reefs. The film is like an inviting turquoise pool with a temperature of 85 degrees. And with a riveting score and perspective camera angles, the film launches itself away from other shtick to become noticed, but in my opinion, not really all the praise is worth it.",6,1,2,20 June 2007
My Neighbor Totoro," There should be more films like this
","So simple, so poetic. Two young girls move to the country and discover to helpful furry friends. 'My Neighbor Tortoro' is a celebration of childhood and imagination and the film is executed brilliantly. The plot is the least of the film's worries. It just goes with the flow, and yet it's fully allowed to. The major conflict in the film doesn't arrive until past the middle, but its odd narrative is more of its subtle beauty. Without to much apparent conflict, we're invited to watch the flashes of fish in the river and uncover odd critters that live in the attic. And so, the magic in the film subtly blends with childhood discovery. There's tadpoles in a puddle, and cute little critters that disappear when chased. There's a big critter with an inviting stomach. The hand painted fluid and organic animation is beyond gorgeous and very appropriate for the earthy flair to this film. Speaking of earth, I find films like these to be the best advocates of environmental protection. We're not padded over the head with anything, but the image of a bottle in a clear lake leaves a strong impact to all viewers. That of course is just another side theme in the film, the importance of nature, and more importantly, it's a non-objectable message. It breaths for me like a painting, and yet the atmosphere is so relaxing and engaging. I don't hesitate to accept the world the little girls create/experience. The messages are those that everyone can relate to. I never grew up Japan (or found any magical creatures that I can remember), but I could certainly identify with the film's two main characters. And if you didn't have a great childhood, sit back and enjoy the adventures of the two eager little girls in this wonderful little film that's also a landmark in animation.",10,1,3,5 June 2007
Dreamgirls," A different perspective
","All though I've been to a couple of musicals, I wouldn't call myself someone who is deeply immersed into that particular culture. As for the hype about the Jennifer Hudson's debut and all that stuff, I was living in a cave. I understand now that 'Dreamgirls' was a popular and influential stage-play that paid tribute to many Motown icons. My criticisms of the film are usually instantly refuted by the fact that this is a musical or that it was referencing the original source material. For all films, I don't pay attention to those specific details, I look at how the film translates to screen. With 'Dreamgirls', I found many themes bewildering, and I do indeed enjoy many other screen-adapted musicals. I guess I can say that I wasn't prepared for Hudson's mental breakdown...I mean spectacular singing monologue. While the audience gazed in amazement as Hudson sang vocal acrobatics, I wasn't convinced by her situation. Sure the singing was nice, I thought the songs could have been better (they don't measure up to the Motown classics), but that shouldn't be the only thing of quality in the film. I found the characters very undeveloped and the story was clichéd to no end. I wouldn't condemn a film for being clichéd if it brought an extra something to the table, but I just couldn't connect with the story. I found the pacing to be too erratic. The film delivered one song after the next and involved such forced emotion and drama I was taken aback. Due to this, the big anticipated highlights of the film don't seem warranted.There are some highlights. Eddie Murphy delivers an interesting and humorous performance; it may be the best of his career. Hudson succeeds in vocal execution more than her acting, but she delivers an acceptable performance. We get the expected performance from Beyonce who generally plays herself. The set designs and costumes were excellent, of course. The movie was typical crowd-pleasing Hollywood with no soul or real depth, at least for me. A fun ride for obviously a lot of people, but marginal for myself and certainly undeserving of the heaps of hype.",7,1,2,7 January 2007
Ratatouille," Pulls the most out of an okay story
","Ratatouille is a major step up from a lot of last year's animated fare, and a vast improvement from last year's Oscar winner for best animated feature. Here we re-discover sweet simplicity amped up with the expected story-telling techniques of Pixar, and here's the kicker, no heavy handed messages hammered in with a drill, but there certainly is a message and it's delivered with subtler grace despite some flaws. Although, aspects to the message are borderline confusing if you over analyze the reality that occurs in the film, but the film doesn't scream for over-analyzation in the same fashion as 'Finding Nemo'. For me, the animation slightly overpowers the story, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The film is directed, camera-wise, with the same interesting techniques as 'Happy Feet', but the film has more in store. We get to see the world mainly from Remmy's perspective, and it's visually exciting. The camera-work is what makes the film's physical humor work so well. More on the artistic scheme, the film looks really great. Particularly the lighting stands out. The colors are very lush and detailed; very accurate toward a real city-scape. Then the rat's fur are very impressive, it moves against the wind and gets wet very much like real rat hair. Don't let the detail in the clothes get past you either. The film manages to find a balance between superficial realism and animated characters. The character designs for the humans are marvelous (Bird seems to get much humor out of the smaller villains as seen in the past 'Incredibles' and the non-Pixar film 'Shrek') and the rats, while moving a lot like real rats still have acceptable personalities and animated form. So we feel like we're entering an animated world that is fleshy and real. Speaking of such, other animated marvels are the organic forms of the food. As real as the food in the film is, the film rightfully capture the spirit of the plot it pursues. It introduces the viewer into the world of fine-dinning and develops something rare in today's animation, a bleeding heart.Story-wise, that's the only area where I can detect any trace of criticism. I felt at times, dare I say it, that the emotion was a little bit forced. There were just certain times I didn't understand a certain character's frustration. Also, I felt uneasy about the films unusual balance of fantasy and realistic themes, such as how the reactions to rats were carried our toward the end of the film and how it blends into the films major theme and other suspend disbelief occurrences. That lack of coherent continuity gives a writer a lot more flexibility in how to tell the story. In other words, it's kind of a shortcut. But it's an observation that is made up for by other successes in the film. The film very impressively for an animated film delivers some conventional themes with a little more depth (to truly enjoy it, I'd recommend erasing the fact that rats often carry disease from your mind). It's cute without embarrassingly forcing it and unpretentious. The very fact that what makes it work may fly over the heads of small children isn't a reason to condemn it. It's true though that I feel that younger kids may get a little restless halfway though, and not just through my own experience at the theater. however, this is another great film for an older audience to enjoy a simple well told story. As for whether it will have that lasting effect that Pixar films usually carry, only time will tell.",7,143,263,17 June 2007
Cars," A Valiant effort
","As soon as I saw the teaser trailer for Pixar's next installment 'Cars', I just knew they wouldn't be able to pull off the magic again. After actually seeing the film I found out they did, well, kinda-sorta. What I love most about John Lasseter's 'Toy Story' was it's engaging premise, characters, and situations, wholly unbelievable yet you willingly went along with it. The result? It was immensely entertaining, even moving. With it's on point humor and 'realism', the film succeeded with leaps and bounds, not necessarily requiring an amazing story to launch it into brilliance. I immediately realized that making automobiles with windshield eyes and mouths truly exist in their own world would be a challenge. Many children have a natural fascination with cars, but not really in such the way it is done here. Pixar's usual amazing imagery does 'Cars' a big service, but in the end, Lasseter manages to keep audiences engaged by humanizing the likes of Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy. You really get the feeling that this film was nurtured with the same TLC as some of Pixar's finest, but the subject matter, and certainly the clichÃ©d story, force the film to to run out of gas. Some of the characterizations are more matching to much of the non-Pixar releases; human ethnicity based and that being the reason for the laughs. Also missing is the correct amount of wit, inventiveness, and hilarious dialogue such as in 'Toy Story', although it comes in sporadic amounts with hits and misses. 'Toy Story' of course had nostalgia on it's side and cleverly transformed that into a play representation that both adults and kids could really enjoy. I'm afraid much of our emotional connection to cars are limited. And so, I respect 'Cars', even though I really think it isn't that good, at least as compared to Pixar's other films. With Nascar boring unfortunates dragged to it's confines by interested fans around America, it is truly a miracle that 'Cars' succeeds in the way that it does. It's good for one ride, but it's impact is lacking for another spin.",6,1,3,25 August 2007
Bolt," A fulfilling fun film
","Bolt is a fun easy to swallow romp with a soft accessible palate of caricature and lush picture-scape that easily pleases the eyes. It does not boggle the imagination nor is it an exercise in stylistic pacing, comedy, or characterization, but it's a welcome family film without pretension that offers a feel-good adventure that I certainly enjoyed. The film does have a surprising amount of human touch despite the formula and pre-packaged cute that I expected the film to use as its main source of energy. It follows yet another journey (typical of the 'cgi talking animal family film' genre) of a Buzz Light year-esquire white American Shepard with an altered perspective of reality, a notably emaciated cat, and a hamster that derives it's laughs from being a parody of the overzealous fan-boy that says 'Awesome!' all the time (quite effectively, however). In the film Bolt is actually disturbingly exploited, as he is made to think he and his owner are in actual danger on a consistent basis. One wonder's how his supposed loving owner Penny would be able to take one day of that, but alas it isn't taken so seriously, as it's a premise needed for the film to exist. It was due to this however that I sympathized with his character, and the added lack of humanity came from the fact that Mittens, Bolt's accomplice for the journey, is a stray that once had a home. The emotion in this respect is treated rather typically but it strikes the right chords to teach a valuable lesson which is often absent in films featuring cute dogs and cats. The only main character un-abused by people is Rhino the hamster, who offers much of the comic relief between the confused Shepard and the captive struggling feline. The film is animated well, no shocker there for films from high-end companies like Disney, and the character movements, especially from the pigeons, keep up the spirit of animated zest. There are even some great action sequences; the fake scenes from the TV show (that are featured in the previews like they're the main film) are great as well as the more down to earth scenes. The conclusion's emotions are a tad forced, and a lot of other elements are predictable, but Bolt picks up enough steam and plays with it's situation enough to warrant it's place as a genuinely good animated film.",6,0,4,29 November 2008
The Incredibles," A bewildering combination of brilliance and despondent themes
","I want to congratulate director Brad Bird on one of the most original animated opening sequences I've seen. From the very start of the film, the viewer is all ready to submerge into a film that takes animation and 'children's entertainment' to a whole new level, and this level isn't just pretentious gibber concocted to look revolutionary. This is the real thing. And it's almost a superb film. But I must take strong, even drastic conflict with the underlying themes that the film presents. What makes the 'The Incredibles' both excellent and reprehensible is Bird's writing that unfortunately overlooks and neglects aspects in it's presentation. At least I hope so. The film leaps back and forth from a respectable animated film into something dark and ugly, and, amongst such, paints a gloss over it and claims accessibility to children. It is such a fact that I pray is never repeated. Bird's writing flounders in the very fact that it is trying to promote a message, and not a silly one. While doing so in the context of a superhero film, the film meanders back and forth from being real and fantastical. Essentially, the film can't decide what it wants to be. Does it want to pay homage to classic comics where elements of our reality are taken for granted or does it want to portray a strange new world where supers are taken out of context and applied a different role in the society? That is, the film begs to be taken as some kind or allegory, at the time maintaining, even emphasizing it's seriousness. The film contains fantastic voice work from the whole cast involved, and toward the middle of the film there are some impressively convincing moments of drama and suspense. What is further done with this is utterly disappointing. The film sporadically morphs back into a comic book where the lives of everyone except our heroes are meaningless, as is the physical and emotional pain of these characters. Some situations that involve very serious acts perpetuated by the protagonists are never resolved and are thusly deemed as acceptable. This is evident from the very start of the film when our hero, who's personality is much more like the appearances of the characters in 'Monster's Inc', derides the talent of the soon-to be powerful villain as a youngster and never cares to say anything about it until years later, when the tables are turned. The film's message is to point out that 'no, we aren't all special', and I can live with that to a certain degree because it's true for the most part. But one wonders if these certain facts are necessary for smaller children to digest? Perhaps this film isn't for them at all, and that's fine. What do I as an older person think? I think these themes scream some pretty reprehensible notions, and it killed any entertaining factor that 'The Incredibles' had, as well as making me dislike the characters. Aside from our hero's treatment of Buddy and his hardly fairly matched boss in the beginning, when you view what occurred in terms of the film's overall theme it fails to mesh into anything we'd think as admirable if you're the average caring person. Buddy's child-like enthusiasm for his talent is not a bad thing, but it is treated as such. One talent is favored over the other, and I'm not sure why. Justifably, Buddy seeks out to be like his ex-hero and is killed for it. Wait, I'm completely aware of Buddy, who's later turned into Syndrome, is a serial killer. But what can we say about the depiction of a struggling person desperate to be labeled what is considered 'special' as a vicious murderer? Something just isn't right here. It isn't helped by the very fact that virtually every non-super is either looney or negative in nature. There are further questionable sequences in the film, including the aforementioned violence occurring toward the end, that even while in self-defense, it is not believable when compared to the same intensity of other scenes involving the protagonists in mortal danger. I certainly do demand that films, despite the lowered standards for family entertainment, be further observed beyond their entertainment value or admittedly very good direction. Still, the film is also to be commended for it's artistic landscape, a somewhat 1950's universe laden with modernist design. A true rarity animation for adults is, and this so disappointingly has to offend in an unusual and problematic way.",7,3,5,18 June 2007
Shrek the Third," Well I had fun
","If you judge 'Shrek 3' on its own, it isn't as terrible as some seem to think it. Sure, the film is pointless and mediocre, dismembers some of the qualities that made use fall in love with the characters in the first place, uses babies as an excuse for another film and merchandising...yikes that doesn't sound so good. But the truth is, I was entertained by this film that seemed like a really good straight to video sequel. It's humor sure was clever enough to exceed 'Shark Tale'. Perhaps that isn't a huge compliment, but the animation is up to its usual quality and, to my delightful surprise, the new additions to the Shrek cast didn't overtake the story of have any moments of grating 'cuteness'. The film still has those laugh out loud moments.But still, this film doesn't touch 'Shrek' and even dwells in the shadow of the less stunning 'Shrek 2'.I think this film is a clear sign that the series should come to an end. The writers have run out of ideas, and another attempt would surly be another weak attempt that would have to be condemned. The whole film is treated as seriously as Fiona's amphibious dad's death. When I left the theater, I didn't come out thinking I'd just seen one of the most anticipated films of the year, and if it wasn't for the hordes of children around me, I surely wouldn't have given it a second thought. Still, the film is worth seeing...once.",6,11,24,19 May 2007
Ice Age," It's average...and immoral
","Maybe a bit below. For me, 'Ice Age' is what defined the decline of inventive story-telling in the new cgi era. I remember seeing this in theaters. I was thrilled to see it because I was mentally inclined to think that cgi = greatness thanks to the likes of Pixar. Aside from the incorporation of several 'Scrat' sequences, the film was average average average. I had the thought process of the film fully envisioned in my head after viewing it. The creators needed a unique environment with some animals and chose the ice age. They then invented a very 'Shrek'-esque formula: a tetchy large protagonist is accompanied by a underdog who for no apparent reason insists on joining in on the journey to complete the task that is the conflict of the film. It is however less inspired than 'Shrek' and the laughs are more sporadic. Well, for me anyway. I must admit that the audience is always driven to giggles over the annoying 'sabre tooth' squirrel thing that suffers in his many pursuits for nuts. I hate it, it's a Looney Tunes rehash. But if the crowd likes, fine. That is actually a merit for the film. The other characters, 'Manny', 'Sid' and 'Diego' are average characters when it comes to personality. Diego is the soon-to-be-redeemed for his evil meat eating ways (as long as he's not human) character who will learn to befriend the annoying sloth and the stubborn Mammoth. Manny will learn to love and respect the small child that falls into his care despite the fact that the child will grow to cause the extinction of Manny's species. Too bad he can't learn to respect the tigers for attempting, like the humans, to live. Nope, the tigers are evil demons. Moving on.Sid is the irritating sidekick. Dorry, Donkey, Mike from 'Monster's Inc' all come to mind, although most likely it wasn't plagiarized from any of those. He did garner the most laughs aside from 'Scrat', the infamous squirrel and his nut. The story overall is not very interesting or creative. Some animals find a human child and must return it, finding laughter along the way. The attention is gained from the character's antics (which many have grown to love). If you aren't interested in the characters you'd hate the movie. The overall theme of the film is that meat-eaters should give up meat and magically live while befriending the prey. Also, that animals are reprehensible for causing any kind of discrepancies to the human race in an effort to not be killed for their fur, and that the animals should deal with it. Indeed, a watermelon is 'hilariously' stolen from some dodo birds for the human and we laugh at the stupid soon-to-be-extinct birds as our heroes effectively steal from them. The film epitomizes the formulaic talking animal genre, for the most part, but the main problem is that it relies on the gimmicks on the comedy and it isn't gut-wrenchingly funny. I had a hard time laughing at the screwed morality. Luckily, as usual, I was the only one who noticed it. What I have left to review is the animation, which for the time was adequate. The film is average, and it needs to get it's problems with the food chain settled out. It caused Ebert to give thumbs up to Disney's 'The Wild' for paying heed to this issue.",5,1,2,18 January 2007
WALL·E," 'Wally' is a charmer
","Pixar's latest animated romp doesn't fail to entertain with its consistent heart and warmth, being rather distinctive from Bird's projects. It's a film that I believe is easy to swallow, borrowing heavily from heartwarming films like City Lights but maintaining its expected Pixar sheen of dictating its emotion from pure human essence and experience. That goes strictly however for the construction of the unlikely relationship between the film's title hero and his romance with E.V.E, a very lively and interesting supporting character. Love will find a way, even if it has apparently left the human species, who have lost themselves amongst material consumerism. The film goes along this path, emphasizing touch, beauty and compassion as essential elements to living, and how the technological extensions of ourselves have come to embody our past nature. The two main characters set off a series of events in a very strongly influenced by '2001:A Space Odyssey' setting. The references aren't exactly subtle, and perhaps the film's universe relied to heavily on this influence, as well as the storyline. The environment and animation however were expectedly beautiful to look at. In terms of the lack of dialogue in this film, it was rather a daring move, but the film is still expressively similar to its dialogue-ridden predecessors. The music and riveting 'computer-acting' substituting as the voicing was enough to pull the common film-viewer through, similar to DreamWorks's film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmeron (without its narration) or even classic toons of the 50's and 60's. It was all executed well but not originally. The strength of the interaction scenes comes from the level of detail and care put into them; it's simple yet effective. This film speaks to adults in ways that aren't attainable in so-called mature cinema (films with overwhelming complexity and the inclusion of themes children shouldn't see). People see Pixar films as a way to escape and to laugh at curiosity and simplicity, somewhat of a trigger to what's left of their dwindling childhood memories. Wall-E incorporates this into a familiar sci-fi landscape that sparks even more enticement and gives the romance of the two characters whimsical interest, making for dazzling visuals and an all around pleasing adventure. So what held some of this back for me was the low-level satire. The fate of the humans was simply that of such in the film Idiocracy with the crude humor extracted. All the humans are proportionately hefty in red jumpsuits and flying chairs. For me, I found that imagery uninteresting, and I didn't even like looking at; not because of the proposed exaggerated fate, but because of the sheer lack of imagination. Wall-E does exercise a lot of established joking beliefs, such as machines taking over for us causing us to become fat and useless, and humans destroying the entire planet. Shockingly, the portrayals don't come of as overly cynical or smug, because it maintains a communication of our nature that everyone can appreciate. The film is special in that the environmental message didn't hijack the story such as in 'Happy Feet' because it was essential to the story.However, the film's greatness is held back strongly by a lot of these elements, mainly because their so elementary. The humans' emotion toward the end of the film are also tacked on, and although it may be part of the story that the humans are so vapid, they still play a strong part in the story of the little robot, yet they're severely reduced to the point of causing the film to lack scope. The film does a handsome job at crafting the relationships, but it shows considerable weakness in other areas that are made up for with the ever-so-pleasing cgi visuals and 'cutesy' humor that depends on how much and when the robots will exhibit a sweet little glistening of human emotion. It's all apparent from the title, Wall-E, in which we would prefer 'Wally', as he's a huggable and sympathetic character that personifies the sensation of longing and soul with just his character design alone. The film is essentially about spirit and oncoming banality, which could be easily related to much mass-produced animated films, and 'Ratatouille' comes into mind here too with that theme. So while it delivers, I found it less then a masterpiece, but still a piece worth seeing for sure, and a great inspiring addition to animated cinema.",7,1,5,27 June 2008
Happy Feet," 'Happy Feet' my foot
","'Happy Feet' may just be the most original cgi film of the year along with 'Monster House'. I have always anticipated a film that would break the slew of conventional children's entertainment. Even though this film appears to be my dream come true at first glance, impressive weirdness is not the only ingredient that makes an excellent film, and the film was flawed to the point that it settled into mediocrity with it's conventional predecessors.The story was noticeably weak, but I don't think this film was created to have a good story, however. It was intended as an aesthetic animal fable, another story of the accomplishments of one individual a la 'Babe'. The universal consensus of this film is that it has spectacular animation. Although I question if this is a 'triumph' in animation. The Warner Brothers' 'The Polar Express' sported similar realism last year give or take a few artistic appliances, and the animation in 'Happy Feet', I believe, is over hyped due to what was being animated and how it was being animated. It still worked though and was beautiful to look at. The point of cgi isn't to create photo-realism though. Its' focus on realism would mean the story would have to compensate for the lack of creativity in the character designs, and wellthe story was weak. 'Toy Story' succeeds with its clever writing and wit. 'Happy Feet' does not ('I like big tails and I cannot lie'case closed). The main message itself is typical. The 'underlying messages' are questionable. To Happy Feet's advantage, the cinematography is superb (George Miller can certainly direct). One can see the thought process involved with this movie. The creators formed the characters and said 'uh oh' when they realized that Mumble resembled all the other birds way too much, so they added a layer of baby down to his slick feathers incorporating that into the idea that his egg being temporarily unprotected altered his nature. This tiny touch, among other things, gave me the impression that this film was thrown together with the objective to create a penguin film using motion capture techniques. Different themes, religious, social, whatever, are thrown in at will and pop up in confusing areas. Any film that attempts to connect serious themes with singing penguins must do so delicately and with craftsmanship. Unfortunately this film suffers from bothersome transitions and tone shifts. There are questionable turns in the plot that don't seem to flow properly. You feel as though the writer smacks you down by luring you in with cute euphoria then changing the feel of the film into a grating preach fest about this and that. It is unpleasant and irksome, by technical film standards also. The last moments of the film are sloppily written and ill conceived. The constant push of making Mumble's 'amigos' persuasively Latino was unnecessary and at times a tad bit racist. My concerns have nothing to do with agreeing or disagreeing with the blatant 'propaganda' in the film (I for the most part happen to agree); I just question why those themes needed to be there, or more, they were inserted inappropriately. The George Miller's earlier produced flick 'Babe' could have been slanted toward promoting meat-consuming abstinence. It was however subtle enough so that you may not be bothered by it, as you enjoyed the terrific story. This isn't the case with 'Happy Feet'. I must empathize something. The film directly shoots itself in the foot when attempting to portray all zoos in a bad light. It's extremely ridiculous for a film trying to force a green message upon it's viewers when zoos do indeed aid in penguin conservation. It makes me wonder about the credibility of the creators. This may end up being one of the most destructive films for wildlife since 'Finding Nemo'. Oh the horrendous irony.This film is a sign that producers are trying new ideas, and I encourage that. They are on the right road to creating film that can entertain and be spectacular all the same. It's unfortunate that in this case, it didn't quite reach that mark and succeeds only as a film to marvel in regard to the animation. The film undoubtedly warrants discussion with young children.",5,2,8,18 November 2006
Pocahontas," Great music enhances a story refusing to exit Disney's rules for safe film-making
","I hate to admit, but Disney's Pocahontas, a film near and dear to my heart, is indeed severely flawed. Aside from the film's wonderful beautiful imaginative score, the true core of the film, the character relationships, and the depiction of another culture are frighteningly one-note. Pocahontas can be considered a true children's film. There isn't really anything of substance to engage a mature viewer outside of the die hard Disney/children's entertainment addicts, and admittedly without the film's inspired songs, it would be pretty banal. The film truly aims for a satisfactory portrayal of Native American Indians. Nothing objectable, nothing indecorous from what we expect from Disney. Unfortunately, the story and characterization fall along the same guidelines. The film establishes the Native American society as very close to nature, and that the invading colonies basically aren't. The cultural gaps between the protagonists are hastily filled with several occurrences of Disney 'magic' and the like. The film is missing a true human core. Most of the criticism seems to come from the fact that the film is grossly inaccurate on the real story of the pubescent Indian and the fully grown settler. I find such criticism unfair and irrational. The film doesn't aim to please devout historians, but more importantly, Disney has no intention of creating their first PG-13 animated cartoon. And here the film succeeds in that children can watch a film with the name 'Pocahontas' that hints to the familiar story taking place in Virgina, a noticeably 'flat' Virigina. Which brings me to a not very often mentioned criticism. The 'Virgina' in the film resembles some place in Colarado. I admire the film's stylization, but I have a slight qualm on not being able to appreciate flat Virgina in it's own beauty. It seems even more problematic in a film who's major theme seems to be nature and the often overlooked wonders of it amidst rapid industrialization and economical corruption. That minor criticism seems to personify the bigger picture in why the film 'fails'. It settles for a shallow look into culture and prejudice that's easily accessible to children but leaves adults unmoved, aside again from the amazing music that the Disney Co. does finest. And really, the music makes the film, not-really-profound dialouge aside.",5,7,13,24 July 2007
