Sucker Punch," What A Video Game Movie Should Be
","I love this movie a whole lot but I've found so many people hate bashing it. And the reason why is I think they don't understand it. There is really no movies out there like this one, except for Scott Pilgrim. So it's a new venture for film. It's pretty much a video game movie done right, just not based off any particular game. The movie plays like different levels of a game, each in their own world, with a different objective to achieve.Also it has a video game type of story telling, where you don't question how things work in this world, they just happen and it's cool. Similar to the film Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, in where they fight with pretty much fantasy powers that no one questions, they just go with it. But just like Scott Pilgrim it's a movie for people who grew up in the 90's with video games, anime, and anything from Japan.Well it's definitely not a movie for anyone and everyone but if you grew up in the 80's and 90's playing video games and watching anime you should appreciate what it this flick represents.",10,4,10,7 April 2011
