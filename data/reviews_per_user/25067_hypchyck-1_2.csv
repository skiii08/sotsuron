50 First Dates," I love this movie.
","Adam Sandler is definitely hit or miss...funny, but the same old funny over and over...so not funny much anymore.But this movie - I love it. Drew Barrymore is adorable, real and convincing in her role...she brings the movie to life. The supporting actors are great too...Beautiful setting...And Sean Astin's role as her brother is awesome!If you're looking for an enjoyable, heart-warming comedy/love story, you should check it out. And hey, just like Lucy, if you don't like it move on tomorrow. It's one of those I'll watch anytime it's on!",10,0,0,2 August 2011
A Star Is Born," Lady Gaga - WOW
","This movie is worth the watch for her performance alone. I've never seen previous versions of ASIB - but I feel confident saying she makes the role her own. There was one point in the film where I thought to myself 'Wow, she is blowing this out of the water'. Her voice can move you tears, so big and so raw - and her acting follows suit. Well worth the watch!",9,0,0,4 October 2018
