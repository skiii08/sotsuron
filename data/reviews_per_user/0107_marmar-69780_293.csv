The Rock," the rock
","The rock is by far the best movie that bay ever made and put his hands on,it is actually shame cause in this movie bay showed that he had talent for making cool enjoyable action films but all of that was gone when he started to fall under his bayisms in his future films im talking about you transformers,cage was good put still the weakest segment compared to connery and harris cause two of them were far to good for this kind of film,action was very nice to look at and some gunfights and chases were very thrilling and full of action and testorones,the rock was a very fun enjoyable 90s film and i think that it deserves far more attention then it actually gets",8,0,0,5 June 2020
The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," double life of verinique
","Double life of verinique is simple said not a film for me bit i still watched it and i strugled to find redemining quality in a film and if i can pick one it would be solid performances,but even does looked off in scenes,there are far better foreign franch films out there that are worthy of your time and not this one,double life of veronique is a film that could work on specific demigraphic percent of moviegoers but if you are expecting too see some masterpiece you wont,plot of this film was for me to poorly done and without bigger impact on a experience of watching it,and i would rather spend my time on something else and not on this film ever again",3,1,3,7 January 2020
Ford v Ferrari," ford v ferrari
","I wont dinied ford v ferrari has quality in it which is hard not to have when mangold is director and damon and bale stars and it will be great watch for some,but to me it wasnt,i was never fan of cars and racing so i coudnt invest myself in story and at some points it became for me boring and to long,ford v ferrari will probably win some awards and for that i say it deserves,but at the end i myself would rather watch something else",5,5,14,22 November 2019
The Blair Witch Project," the blair witch project
","The blair witch project is a very devisive film,some people will appriciate its idea and use of creepy feeling and vibe even without showing anything,and some will hate it since it is for them to boring and nothing happens,well for me blair withc project is one of my favourite found footage films and it is very effective horror that give me unnerving feeling while watching it and good dose of creepyness,true we never saw the witch but we also didnt have to ,we rather saw how panic and fear are big enemy in this film and how it turns friends against each other,and making this film in found footage style made everything more realistic and more relatived to characters we are watching",7,0,1,2 April 2020
The Lobster," the lobster
","The lobster is a film that for the most of parts i enjoyed very much and it made me laugh and smile in a few scenes more then modern comedys,maybe that is becase this film puts more darker comedy that workes for this kind of film and it blends with a story in a very good way,farrel give a very impressive performance and he grow in my eyes after watching him in this and killing of sacred deer,rest of cast was also very good and they give film neceserey quality moments and some good use of comedic situations,lobster is a film that was very interesting ,towards second act it become to be repipative and ending was weaker to me but i still had fun time with this original project",7,0,0,10 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," kill bill vol 2
","Kill bill vol 2 is the same way i though about first one,it is a solid made film but for me not one of tarantino best,it caries itself with good fight and sword fighting choreography and bloody but satisfaying scenes in path of brides revange,but i thought the story or script and dialogue could be better written in both films since tarantino is master of screenplay and engaging conversations,staff that in this duology missed a lot,uma is again badass but her character was to me to unexplored and i wanted to learn more of her training days and how she become what she is,since that part of film was most fun to watch,kill bill films arent best revenge films but they surved their purpose",6,0,1,3 January 2020
Black Swan," black swan
","Black swan is a film that is very twisty and sometimes to much for its own good,acting,dancing,music and overall direction is all very good,portman give one of her best performances and aronofsky gived film a good visually look and solid script,what film lacks for me was deeper meaning and more original and not so obvious ending and cliches that are seen in a lot of ballet themed movies,mila kunis give a very good potreyal of sexualism and seduction and she even surprised me with that ,cassel also bring some charm in it and he did good part in role,black swan was a film that is maybe little overrated to much,but it is still a solid and watchable film",7,0,1,4 April 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," on stranger tides
","On stranger tides give us breathe of fresh air thanks to penelope cruz character and thats it,the rest of film is basicly a mess starting with not so good anymore depp who looked bored through most of film,proceding to plot with siren and priest guy that was completly out of place and it felt forced and in our nose pushed,and finale with plot and different twist that was predictable and death of blackbeard who was most boring and unintersting villain of franchise",3,0,0,2 December 2019
Men in Black 3," men in black 3
","Men in black 3 is for me far better installesment then previous one,this film had some charm from first one and dose of good old fashioned fan that mixes with great brolin who killed impresionating tommy lee jones,slso villain did a good job compared to men in black 2 ones,but biggest flaw for me was chemisty between will smith and tommy who were noticable tired of this role and they just waited to get their paycheck,men in black 3 was a fine time in some times but in other it lacked what first one had good designs and good sense of humour and this one had that in a smaller bitt and it failed to surpass original",5,0,0,10 January 2020
Scarface," scarface
","Scarface 1983 is defienetly one of most entereining gangster films ever made and all of that can be thanked to al pacino who give awesome performance here and he stole every scene he was in,the film may a bit long but even if i also felt it i didnt mind it to much since story was fast moving and captivating in most parts of film,film represents very well how we can easily get to power and money but it also shows that is even easier to lost all of that,rest of cast starting with pffeifer did a solid job and they didnt wasted their roles and welcome,tony montana is also one of most badass characters and quateable lines are remembered still today,scarface is great enterteining gangster film",8,1,1,5 March 2020
Love and Death," love and death
","Love and death is film that showcases woody sense of humour and jokes in this film are cleverly written , performances in a film by allen and keaton are also very enterteining and they blended in a story rather well,also entire point of a film to make fun of war and following leaders and people in power is done in a respectful way but it also made some points that are satirical but still make a lot of sense if you think little about them,love and death of course like most of comedys some unfunny moments and lines that arent nowdays funny but i can say that is in minority in this film,love and death is a good comedy to watch with some really good laughs",8,0,0,23 February 2020
Howl's Moving Castle," howls moving castle
","Howls moving castle is, not surprising another great animated film from miyazaki and he did again put a great kids story in a beautiful and very impactful movie,animation is again masterful to look at and honestly im little tired to write that for every his film but that is the way it is,characters i mean all of them were very fun,interesting and full of development and uniquenes,this film also has very nice story that will work on adults also and its messages about war are very important to hear and very impactful,howls moving castle is another great animated film from japanese factory of awesomeness and they proved again how they are the best in their work",8,0,0,11 April 2020

Gremlins," gremlins
","Gremlins is for a big reason a cult christmas film that many families watch every year,practical effects and overall movements and design for gremlins are still very great and they still hold up today in almost every scene,only one scene was little off and not so good made if you saw film you will know which one,even if this feels like christmas film it also has some dark humour and violence that may not be for younger audience but for me it worked rather well,also i think many people will admit that gizmo is one of cutest creatures ever put on screen,gremlins is great film to watch at least once in a year if not more",8,2,3,19 February 2020
Requiem for a Dream," requiem for a dream
","Requiem for a dream is a film that is reason that i will never take drugs and from the subject that film is showing i will say that aronofsky was very sucesful in making it and putting it on screen,while trainspotting has more goofy vibe and comedic situations,requiem for a dream has none of that,and i say it is like that for the better of final product,it was really hard to watch how all characters are ruining their lives becase their addictions to drugs and also tv,mostly becase it was made in such realistic way that it put me through some nasty scenes,but that just give bigger impact to message,requiem for a dream is a very effective film drugs and how addictions towards them can easily destroy lifes",8,0,0,4 April 2020

10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 cloverfield lane
","10 cloverfield lane was so good and fun to watch small thriller with some great performances and intersting and unpredictable story and give us some good twists in a film,during that times i was very happy for what i was seeing on screen and then ending happend and put entire film on the lower grade,which is sad considering how good first and second act were made but all of that were ruined by putting aliens in the end and it complety changed mood and feel of film,some people were dissapointed that film didnt connected itself with original cloverfield film but i was happy becase of that until that unfortunate ending,if you love capivitive thrillers you will like most of a film just try to ignore third act as best as you can",7,0,0,16 January 2020
Skyfall," skyfall
","Skyfall is far better then that awful previous one quantum of solace and it shows great director can easily make differance in a quality of a movie and how important they actually are,skyfall is also very pretty looking film and colors in it looked amazing and they fitted in a story excelent,craig is back at his best and it felt like here he is completly different person compared to solace and that is a big plus,bardem as silva was also very interesting and it was good choice to show us his history and staff with m,also with found out some staff about bond through it and it just made his character more personal,skyfall was a huge impruvment compared to a quantum and it gets bond film back on a track",8,1,4,12 June 2020
Iron Man 3," iron man 3
","Well iron man 3 is approvment compared to last one and it ended iron man trilogy with some one great film,one mediocore film and one bad film,staff i didnt liked here was ruining character of mandarin and his whole plot twist being a actor felt like a slap in face to many comic book readers and to me to,i didnt also liked how they ruined scenes filled with tension and suspense and put mindless jokes and humour to please kids with that,come on give us something more serious marvel,plot with killian was wasted expecely since guy pearce was playing him,iron man 3 has again great rdj,some fun moments and good written script but all of that doesnt help it in a bigger picture",5,0,2,8 January 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," raiders of the lost ark
","Raiders of the lost ark is defientely the best adventure beist film ever made,it is full of quality in every way that is possible to do,through great and iconic lead performed by great harrison ford,through compailing story ,good practical effects and quality made fight scenes that still hold up,and ends with great chase scene that should be rememberd cause it is remarkable and gourgeous to watch helped by spielberg vision,i think this is enough complamenting to see where i go with this,watch it and you will see what i mean",10,0,0,16 December 2019
Resident Evil: Afterlife," redident evil afterlife
","So lets start with my confesion i never played any of resident evil games and watching this film im not sure i ever will,this is one of worsest films i saw in some time,this film is just utter garbage ,it is full of horrible dialogue mixed with unintersting and horrible lead complited with bad acting from most everyone in a film,fight scenes are painful to watch and bad copy of matrix,even the villain acts,looks and talks like agent smith,sons and soundtrack are hourendous to listen ,in the end simple said nothing worked in this so called film,i am glad that i didnt saw rest of franchise cause it would probably put me in depression or give me a horrible headache",1,0,5,10 January 2020
United 93," united 93
","United 93 is a great film that showcased how tragedy and human sacrifice can change a lot of staff in a world,this film slso shows how people when they work together can do good staff and save lifes even if that means to sacrifice their ones,i think that this hard theme and subject was shown in a respectful way and it did put a tone of respect on real people that died that day,and by every right they deserved to be called heroes,united 93 is hard film for sure,it is obvious that you wont enjoy watching it or having fun while doing it,but this film purpose was to put a effect on people and to even maybe to change some people on better and to start new way of living lifes",7,0,2,6 May 2020

","Perhaps the best kid time traveling adventure film of all time with iconic duo with great chemistry,the best part is that even today it still holds up pretty well with some little nitpicks that could be removed from final version but back to the future is still one of most enterteining films that were ever made and make it in really good watch",9,0,0,24 November 2019
The Bourne Supremacy," bourne supremacy
","Bourne supremacy is for me weaker follow up to not so much better first one,while first one had still fresh but established and knowing story that we saw through similiar films,this one had nothin new to offer,it just repeated staff from first and it failed to make them better,biggest mistake for me was killing to early bourne love interest since they had good chemistry in first also they failed again in villain ascept,karl urban is good actor but he was so underused here and they could do so much more with him ,honestly matt damon for me never was my favourite actor and that didnt help him for me to care for his charcter",4,0,2,12 December 2019
Princess Mononoke," princess mononoke
","Princess mononoke is very different animated then we used to see and watch,we must thank japanese culture and they way of animation style to experience it and it is good to take a break from hollywood version of films and give a chance to other country cause they were in some ways able to surpass american films but in same times becase of that i wasnt able to connect to story very much",7,0,0,27 November 2019
Jurassic Park," jurassic park
","Jurassic park is a film on which many children grow up on,and i am one of them,i still remember as a kid watching them and playing with my dinosaur toys and imagining that im in their world,so i give this film i rewatch to see does it hold up now days and through my more experienced eyes,and i must say that it holds up in a still great way,spielberg was able to take something impossible and to make it brilliant,animatronics and effects on dinosaurus expecely close ups are still very masterful made and they basiacly look real,only some scenes from distances look maybe not so impressive like brahiosaurus scene when they feed one of them,jurassic park is another big success from spielberg where he put interesting characters and dinos together and mixed a great final product",9,1,1,5 April 2020
Alien: Covenant," alien covenant
",Sequel to prometheus but it didnt live up to it for me,4,1,5,1 October 2019
All the President's Men," all the presidents men
","All the presidents men is a film that shows how big power media has and how it can bring down on knees even the president,hoffman and redford are very great in this film and they were the best part of it,but lets face it this film isnt as good as you may think it is,the story in beginning when they start to investigate watergate scandal is very interesting and captivating,but after that as they start to discover new staff the film starts also to feel repipative and like they used to many similiar scenes to much times,and film lenght didnt help with it,i would say that this film is on par with the post only this film has more interesting characters",7,0,0,25 February 2020
Evil Dead II," evil dead 2
","Evil dead 2 is a follow up to a very good first film and in some ways and ascepts this one was able to surpass first one,by that i mean that this film is far more funnier then first one,while original had some good jokes and funny moments it still tried the most to gross out people with bunch of blood put on screen and some nasty moments,this film also has tons of that but to me it works better since they turned table and make this one in full blown horror comedy,and that self awereness and jokes about horror tropes worked really great,i would recommend to watch this film even without watching first one,also in short if you liked original you will also love this one,and if not then skip it",8,0,0,26 January 2020
High Fidelity," high fidelity
","High fidelity is film good just for one time watch and probably never again cause it lacks supstance to gain my interest in it,for what is supposed to be some kind of comedy it didnt suceed to make me laugh and that is biggest gripe against it,also what was with idea that cusack charcter talks in camera it felt like some bad sitcom,well if we ignore 'comedy'aspects story is solid in best way possible,and jack black at least for me stole every scene he was in and perhaps only likeable character in entire film,and that is just to little to make sucesful film",5,1,3,20 December 2019
Atonement," atonement
","Atonement is for me just another war film with some romantic plot all over it that doesnt fit for me,i mean if you make a war film make a war film,if you make romantic film make romantic film,dont mix both of that together,cause it damages both types of story,becase of that romance staff i coudnt invest myself in more serious war staff and its impact,at least i can say the actors did a good job for what they had to do,and that is best part of all of that,simply films like this doesnt affect me in any way but i can recognize some good staff in it at least",4,0,5,23 December 2019
V for Vendetta," v for vendetta
","V for vendetta is a film with a big political message with big risk to potrey it in a film,it is also very unique and good to see this type of comic book cause is rare to witness and experienced in and even it represents now days more then ever before,hugo is great in this film even without seeing his face he was able to sell his emotions in a best way possible,on other side natalie lost some spotlight from weaving but she gived film bigger legacy and deeper impact and message,this film also gives us real life lessons expecely the line about people and gouverment and i was able to found moving and insparing idea to represed people to fight for their freedom and reason to live normal lifes",8,4,5,6 January 2020
The Godfather," the godfather
","What can be said about godfather that hasnt already been said,godfather is simply one of best films ever made and a must watch for everyone that shares love for movies,godfather has everything incredible cast and performances ,iconic music,great story and grow of characters and their life in criminal world,quateable dialogue with a lot of strong lessons in life we can learn and overall great direction and filmmaking in every way,godfather is simply a masterpiece and i think that this film will been seen and admired in future by many generations to come and they will love this film as much as we love it today",10,0,0,1 March 2020
