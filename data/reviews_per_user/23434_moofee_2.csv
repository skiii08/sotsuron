The Ring," Interesting but weak.
","The premise is very interesting, and the plot starts out very strong, but after the first third the momentum is gone; the plot becomes too scattered, and it presents too many open-ended situations while the balance between the real and the supernatural is lost. At the end I was left unfulfilled, as the ending provided neither an explanation nor did it drift effectively into the imaginary realm to alleviate the need for an explanation.",Null,0,1,11 March 2003
Alien: Covenant," An unimpressive rehash of the original - Spoiler Alert!!!
","Here are the key reasons for which I did not like this film:1. A ship on such mission would never go off plan to explore a mysterious signal from an unknown planet. 2. Once they decided to go and explore, the captain would never leave the mother ship – the command is his most important responsibly. 3. The second in command would always be as qualified as the captain and not an indecisive wimp. 4. Landing on an unknown planet, they would never go without wearing full protective bio suits, including gloves and helmets. 5. On the ground they'd never hike 5 miles in rough terrain to an unknown destination. 6. Smoking cigarettes and cigars and flicking the butt still burning on an unknown planet – only in a bad movie aimed at the heavy smoker Asian market. 7. When they got to the settlement, a hooded 'man' comes out and says 'Follow me' and they do without even asking him who he was. 8. The next scenario is very common these day in all action movies: The brutal fist fight that goes on forever when in real life a couple of times of being thrown against the wall would be enough to knock someone out for days. But in the movies they go on and on then walk away. In this one it was towards the end when the two cyborgs were going at each other. 9. And last, which really should've been first: A total lack of originality – it was almost a complete replica of the original. Receive a mysterious signal. Land on an unknown planet. Unknowingly get infected by the monster. Have the monster emerge from the host's chest and quickly reach adulthood and terrorize the ship until they manage to jettison it into space. The added piece here was that the evil cyborg took control and planted a couple of monster embryos in the incubator, and thereby opening the door to the next sequel.I only saw the first two, and the a great part of the charm of the original was the looks of the ship. It was a mining ship returning to earth after a mining mission. Both the looks of the ship's interior and the scruffy crew was very similar to a seagoing cargo ship of our time. It was very much without all the glitz of sci-fi of today with plenty of CG and flashing light and 'futuristic' decor.My buddy with whom I watched this movie who worked all his life in the defense industry mostly on military rockets and satellites leaned over and whispered to me 'they violated every NASA protocol concerning contact with the unknowns of extra-terrestrial environments'. The example he brought up as being a lot more accurate scientifically was 'The Martian'. I agreed.",4,8,16,24 May 2017
