The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project: 6/10
","When my brother was coming home from visiting relatives on an airplane, he overheard a college student who saw this movie. She said that afterwards, they were so scared nobody wanted to go out for gas. Well, the movie wasn't that scary.Something that I liked is that they didn't need Conrad Baker or anyone to do the camera work, the three principal actors (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams) did almost all of it themselves. Heather, Josh, and Michael (the actors's names are the same in the movie) team up for a documentary about a 'blair witch', who supposadely haunts the woods in Burkettsville, Maryland. After intervewing townspeople, they get off to the woods.It seems that what TBWP is more about is the three amateur directors and their relationships towards each other. They have 'cabin fever', so to speak, from being around each other for so long. But, they do find mysterious things outside of their tent after each morning- piles of rocks, for instance. They hear things that go bump in the night and try chase whatever's making the noise.Soon, the map is lost, in an obvious turn of events. They walk for 15 hours to end up in the same location. There was fear all throughout the movie; mild amount during the day (especially when they see the famous symbols), and moderate during the night. I was truly creeped at the end. I did see this before, on FX, and I was scared at the end. Although the ending is obvious, I do like that style of ending.If you're looking for a horor film where bloody ghosts pop out and cut your head off, take another one. Nothing is seen here; a couple times, the screen is completly blank except for a couple camera lines at the bottom. The editing was very poor, but I guess they're excuse for that is because it's a 'home movie'. The actors were OK, but I understand why they haven't done anything else. So, if you want to be creeped out for most of the time, rent The Blair Witch Project.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language.",6,0,1,9 October 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill: Volume Two: 6/10
","Most people waited six years from Jackie Brown to see Kill Bill: Volume One, the next eagerly awaited movie by Quentin Tarantino. I did not have to, since I had seen none of his previous works. I did, however, see Volume One, and loved it, making this six month wait for Volume Two almost unbearable. The two films, originally to be fused together as an epic, could not be any more different. While Volume One was relentlessly and gleefully violent, without much in the way of plot or characters, a truly entertaining movie. Volume Two, however, was a complete 180: it's mainly a talking heads movie, with a few (generally) non-violent fights, an over development of characters and plot, and a style that Tarantino seems to be stealing from his own classic movie.The Bride (Uma Thurman), a deadly assassin, after having been put into a coma in a wedding chapel by her employer Bill (David Carradine), awakens four years later and swears to kill all involved in that massacre. By the opening of Volume Two, she had already gotten two of them. Next on her list is Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and, of course, Bill.I would have loved to see one four-hour long version of Kill Bill. The series just doesn't work as two parts. They're completely different; if they were one, then, being fused together, it would work perfectly. The first half wouldn't be this extremely entertaining part and then suddenly switching over to drama. Basically, though, that's what the movies are if placed side-by-side. There's not even much material to link the two. Events mentioned in Volume One are shown, but the only repeated scene was the opening scene in the first one, one that wasn't needed to be repeated. Why not show some of the fight between The Bride and O-Ren Iishi (Lucy Liu), or, when The Bride's daughter comes into play, a flashback for when she killed Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) in front of the latter's daughter? They seem like two completely different movies (when they're supposed to be one complete movie separated into two parts).But enough comparisons between the two. Let me go into the specifics of Volume Two. Almost everybody, if not everybody, loves Pulp Fiction, understandably. It's Tarantino's masterpiece. The trouble is, we've come to expect Pulp Fiction from everything he does. Now, Volume One was no Pulp Fiction, but it was just as entertaining, if not more so. I was at least hoping as much for Volume Two. Tarantino has become so cocky in his directing that he believes that any well-written dialogue is entertaining dialogue. This movie's dialogue is well-written, but has nothing to do with the plot and isn't entertaining. It's not funny, nor amusing. In Tarantino's script, we get backstory on people who don't need backstory, which always annoys me. I must admit, however, that the eyeball thing is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.The fight scenes (though few and far between) were amazing. The obvious training that everyone went through must have been quite rigorous. That was always fun to watch and always entertaining. I must also comment on the cinematography. Oftentimes I found myself wondering how they managed to do that. It amazed me in Volume One, also. Its sweeping views, long shots, close-ups, etc. were simply spectacular. Something not so spectacular, however, was Tarantino's 'stylish' choices. A few scenes were shot in black-and-white for no reason, others in partial color for no reason, and others in 1.33:1 aspect ration (the size of your TV screen) for no reason. Why? Because he can, I suppose. The black-and-white sequences meant something in Volume One-the difference between an R and an NC-17. But they were completely worthless here.Volume Two is an entertaining movie for the most part. Some of the dialogue became repetitive and was unnecessary, but for the most part it was a fun watch. Thurman is great, as usual, and was even better here than in the first. Carradine had more to do, but I found him rather flat. Hannah, as Driver, was very good, because her character was more interesting than Madsen's Budd. Madsen, to me, will always be Mr. Blonde, the best part of Reservoir Dogs, to me. I must say, I am disappointed by how this chapter of the killing of Bill is as a whole, but in fifteen years or so, we can look forward to a Volume Three. I'll be first in line there.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence, language and brief drug use.",6,0,1,23 April 2004
Gremlins," Gremlins: 6/10
","Cute furry creatures who talk in nonsense language and never shut up. Furby? Nope, it's a Mogwai, a thing that a man, Randall Peltzer (Hoyt Axton), buys from a Chinese man to give his son Billy (Zach Galligan) for Christmas. Billy firstly enjoys it, after hearing the three rules of taking care of them: don't put them in bright light, don't let them get water on them, and don't feed them after midnight. Bright light kills them, water makes them reproduce, and feeding them after midnight makes them into monsters. So, of course, Zach breaks the rules and wrecks havoc on his small town.Cheesy but fun, Gremlins is a film that seems to just let go and play along. The gremlins were very well made and didn't seem that mechanical (and they do look like giant Furbies). People behind me were talking about how they wanted one. Of course, until they turn evil.This is definately not a thinker's movie. If you just put your mind on hold, it's a fun 100 minutes. If you over-analyze, it can get confusing. Since this is a perfect description of a popcorn movie, the characters leave something to be desired. Who is who? I don't know. But in movies like this, you shouldn't care.The main actors were all good, but it wasn't as funny as movies like this should be. These should be laugh-during-their-adventures, not a-few-laughs-let's-call-this-a-comedy. The stupidity of the characters made most of the laughs.Gremlins (and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom) are the two movies that caused the PG-13 rating to come into play, since the MPAA decided that they were too violent for PG but not enough for R. I understand what they mean (although most of the blood in this movie is green and are the gremlins).Cheesy and fun, but not very funny, Gremlins is a good time waster.My rating: 6/10Rated PG for language, creature violence, and scary situations.",6,0,0,22 December 2002
Miracle," Miracle: 5/10
","I don't really understand Disney's viewpoint of sports movies. Their three main ones, Remember the Titans, The Rookie, and now Miracle, are all similar and different. All of them have underdogs that come up from below to win, but each has a separate quality to them, which I will get to later.Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), who was taken out right before the 1960 Olympics, where the USA won the gold medal in hockey, is hired to coach the 1980 Olympic team. He takes 21 'rag-tag misfits' and tries to put them together as a team to defeat the previously unbeatable Soviet team. Will they be able to do it? Well, considering the title of the movie is Miracle, and it wouldn't be a miracle if the people who have won for the last twenty years won....Remember the Titans worked because it dealt with more than the sport; it had racial issues added to it, adding another layer to it. Also, the clich√© of 'rag-tag misfits coming together to win the big game' worked in that movie, because it focused on general characters, while in Miracle, there wasn't really anything below the surface. Eric Guggenheim's debut script tries to borrow off of other sports movies by attempting to have both interesting subplots involving the coach AND the players...sadly, neither of them work out.The Rookie was great because it showed the protagonist's inner conflict. While Brooks didn't really have any inner conflicts, anything involving the coach was barely fleshed out, and just whatever information we needed was given randomly. It's obvious that Miracle 'borrowed' from those movies, but it's nowhere near as good as they are.Russell is great, though, contrasting the rest of the movie. As the hard-as-nails coach, this might be the performance to really put him into the public's eye. Although the script doesn't put any backstory for him, it's obvious that Russell put hard work into portraying this character. Patricia Clarkson is wasted as his wife, who seems upset that her husband is always away, but name a recent movie in which Clarkson plays someone who isn't upset. All of the people who play the hockey players do what they need to do: skate.I suppose Disney had trouble keeping this movie at a PG. Because whatever fight scenes there were, they were extremely tame. It looked like two figure skaters walking around each other. I don't exactly call that 'rough sports action'. On the other hand, this movie had way too many uses of the word 'hell', it's probably just Guggenheim's favorite word. Although I'm not a big sports fan, I enjoyed some of the hockey action. It's not exciting, because it's obvious who wins, but it's fun to watch.If you go to see the overlong Miracle (in which 30 minutes could have easily been taken out), see it for Russell's performance, or just sneak into it at the end where most of the hockey action is, because there's nothing for the first hour and a half that's that good.My rating: 5/10Rated PG for language and some rough sports action.",5,0,5,13 February 2004
50 First Dates," 50 First Dates: 6/10
","Shoot me, because I think Adam Sandler is pretty much a funny guy. I like his movies and I think they're funny, and he's enjoyable on SNL, and even in his more dramatic work () he still was funny. However, I was a little trepidatious about going to see his latest movie, 50 First Dates, mainly because it was released in February. While I didn't expect it to be a hysterical masterpiece, a la Happy Gilmore, it was an enjoyable romcom, a perfect early year release.Sandler plays Henry Roth, a vet living in Hawaii. His typical relationships are with tourists; he's afraid of commitment (which movie character isn't?). That is, until he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore). The problem is that she has short-term memory loss, so every day he has to impress her again and again. It's not as easy as it may seem, though.This movie plays like a cross between Groundhog Day and Memento. It's like the former because he has to change something every day. And it's like the latter because of the short-term memory loss. But it's nowhere near as good as them, because it doesn't have the charm nor the intrigue of either of them. Instead, it's some typical Sandler humor (including a vomiting walrus!), some other types of humor, and a simple, sweet story. The plot is relatively simple, with just that one twist, which not only is a cheap gimmick but adds to the plot.Personally, I liked Sandler more as a loose cannon than mild-mannered nice guy. Some moments of his are really great (the aforementioned walrus was so overdone I actually laughed), with a couple moments of true hilarity. Some jokes, however, fall flat, and it seems that they forget that Sandler is a comedian, not a romantic. Their romance isn't completely believable, but it sufficed. His movies that have the romance on the back burner always seem to work better, but that's just my opinion. As is usual Sandler fashion, Rob Schneider comes in for a supporting role, and to tell the truth he's great. As a drugged-up Hawaiian guy, the material writes itself. It did disappoint me, however, that the trademark line 'You can do it!' wasn't in there at all.Everything I learned about antereo-grade memory loss I learned from Memento, but I'm ecstatic that they didn't go for the cheesy 'she remembers him after he says he loves her!' Hollywood stuff. In fact, Barrymore did convince me that she had the ailment, and Sandler played his usual self. Sean Astin, as a steroid-using lisping body-builder, is just too odd to comment on, and Dan Aykroyd, in a small role as a doctor, has one great line, but that's it. 50 First Dates is a simple movie, nice to sit through, with some good laughs in the middle of it, but nothing that'll stay with you throughout the rest of your life.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 on appeal for crude sexual humor and drug references.",6,0,0,13 February 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me If You Can: 8/10
","Catch Me If You Can starts off with a boom with a very suave opening credits sequence, where sample people are chasing/being chased and using the credits to hide. Very clever, like the rest of the movie. Then we go to Marseille, France, where Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is talking to Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) and he is released from prison. We are then taken six years earlier, to 1963.Frank's father, Frank Sr. (Christopher Walken) is a grifter of sorts, but nothing major. He's being investigated for tax fraud. And when Frank's mother Paula (Nathalie Baye) is caught cheating, Frank leaves home and first tries out theft in his father's petty ways. Soon he gets way over his head and becomes infamous for writing checks, and soon he's stolen over $4 million. But Hanratty and the FBI is close onto Frank, but always one step behind.I have got to hand it to Steven Spielberg-taking a concept that people like I haven't heard of (gotta read the book!) and manipulating it into a multi-layered story of cat-and-mouse. Of course, it could have been better if there had been more sub-plots. It's mainly Frank having fun and Hanratty chasing him. Also, Hanratty's person needed more depth, but I'll talk about that later.Catch Me If You Can has a good deal of humor for a movie billed as a drama. Its opening credit sequence and Frank's schemes took most of the humor. During his first day at a new school, at a French class, there's no teacher, so why not act as one? That was his first step to stardom, so to speak. I love how he made the checks at PanAm (I'll keep it a surprise). The first half was better than the second half, because it was funnier and more involved. The first half had information about the family and his jobs as a PanAm pilot, doctor, and lawyer. Of course, he hasn't had any training, and it's always worth a laugh to see him struggle. The second half took itself too seriously, and had the now-famous Spielberg fake ending, but at least it wasn't as severe as AI or Minority Report.Depth of the characters, you ask? The movie focused most of the time on Frank, Jr., of course, but we do know some about Frank, Sr. His mother was very underdeveloped and could have been utilized better. Hanratty, we don't really know much about, so it's hard to get deep into his character (but you did get to like Frank). We do learn about his past at the end, but that's kind of unnecessary, isn't it?Leo, I'm not sure if he deserved a Golden Globe nomination, but he was very good. I enjoyed his `dapper dan' attitude, which is what the whole movie was like. It didn't find itself serious (until the end), so it allowed some sort of suave cockiness, which added to the fun and the authentic feel of the 60s (not that I would know, of course). Hanks, with his usual Southern accent, seemed fine (nothing like The Green Mile, though). All of the supporting characters knew their parts (and the one-liners didn't overact or anything!). Jennifer Garner, as a prostitute, is waster and not really needed, mainly just to get to the overlong 140 minute runtime.It's really fun and unpredictable (except the ending); you don't know how Frank is going to conjure up his next scheme. Sure, it tried to get sappy at the end, but it made you feel good, and that's what great movies are all about.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for some sexual content and brief language.",8,1,1,26 December 2002
The Ring," The Ring: 8/10
","Aren't you glad that they have DVDs now? In Gore Verbinski's The Ring, viewers of a special videotape of seemingly unrelated shots get a phone call saying 'seven days', meaning they have seven days to live. That's right. Mr. Budweiser Frogs and Mr. Mouse Hunt made this movie. Quite a transition.Naomi Watts, fresh from Mulholland Drive, plays skeptic newspaper reporter Rachel Keller. She hears about the videotape at a niece's funeral, and decides to investigate. And what does Ms. Smart do? She watches the tape and she gets the phone call. Oy, she'll regret that.The Ring, put in one word, is scary. It checks off the four ills: chills, thrills, spills, and yes, even a few kills. There are many, many tense scenes and scenes that make you jump (or scream, whichever type you are). I'm the jumping type, but in some parts my mouth was open. That's how scary it was. On the downside of the creepiness, Verbinski made too many jump scenes. If he had concentrated on putting on a few more sustained thrills, that would have helped.Watts wasn't super or anything, but she was serviceable. Martin Henderson, as Noah, a partner, was the same, nothing to write home about. Their son Aidan, played David Dorfman, made me think of him as a cross between Haley Joel Osment and a Disney cartoon. He had the look (and at the funeral, was exactly the same way) and he had huge eyes. And speaking of cartoons, I just noticed that Daveigh Chase, from Lilo and Stitch and Spirited Away plays Samara, a very important part of the movie.In a small but important role, Brian Cox plays Richard Morgan, Samara's father. He seemed to do like Donnie Wahlberg did for The Sixth Sense, playing a small part but obviously working hard to perform it. Cox seems to be the hardest working man in showbiz now.The runtime could have been trimmed by a little, but The Ring still kept engrossed me for two hours. It is the type of movie that will either keep you up at night or give you nightmares. Or both.The Ring doesn't really give you any characters to connect with. There aren't many, but some of the time used unnecessarily could have been used with characterization or time to feel for and with the characters.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for scares, violence, ickyness, and some language.",8,0,0,17 November 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark: 8/10
","There are two types of classic movies. There are the `classic' movies, the ones that all critics love but the major of people don't really like, and then there are the classic movies, ones that can never not entertain. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of those that never cease to entertain. Also, in today's movie environment, it's hard to find an action movie that also constantly entertains and keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is a rarity nowadays.The famous plot has Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) first being chased by a gigantic boulder (which has been parodied so many times it felt like I had already seen it), and then going on a treasure hunt to find the Biblical lost ark, which supposedly holds the original Ten Commandments before some Nazis do. Along the way, he meets up with his former teacher/friend's daughter Marion (Karen Allen) who has an important piece of the puzzle, and together the travel to stop the Nazis from, basically, taking over the world.It's easy to picture this movie as a cheesy serial, and, in fact, Steven Spielberg himself said that that's all he thought this was as he was making it. Little did he know that he was going to create one of the most influential movies in the history of American cinema. That has both good and bad side effects. The good is that there seems to be no work like this, none that can compare. The bad is the countless number of imitators. Many have done the `map with the line tracing where the hero goes' now, and it seems like Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the first action movies that has a lot of comedy in it, and now every action movie is labeled as an `action comedy'.Rarely does a movie come along in this vein where you are entertained even when there isn't a fight scene or something that most people would consider exciting on screen. Spielberg knows what the audience wants, and by gum he gives it to them. The majority of people don't want a lot of exposition, so just enough is given. Even when something exciting is not happening on screen, you have to pay attention to understand what everyone is saying with all of their accents. That could be one advantage to seeing this on DVD. Although it would be great to see it on the big screen, I could put on the subtitles at home.I hate to say this, though, but there were a few things about this movie that bugged me. First, even for a crowd-pleasing movie like this, the lack of character development on many side characters bothered me (I'm a guy who loves his character development). Also, although John Williams is a genius composer, the same few bars got a little tiring after he played them over and over again in every scene. All in all, though, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for strong violence/blood and some language.",Null,0,0,10 December 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Who Framed Roger Rabbit: 8/10
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit doesn't have a question mark at the end, because it's supposed to be bad luck. And that's what you'll have if you don't see this film.Private dick Eddie Valient (Bob Hoskins) works in a Hollywood-esqe place, nex to 'Toon Town', where cartoons live. His brother was killed by a toon, and Eddie never found out who did it. So he hasn't gone near Toon Town since. But when he takes pictures for R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern), owner of Maroon Cartoons, where Roger Rabbit works, of Roger's wife Jessica (an uncredited Kathleen Turner) playing patty-cake with rival cartoon maker Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). Soon Acme is dead, and everyone thinks Roger did it. But only Eddie knows the truth.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a landmark film, put simply. The combination of live-action and animation is perfect; sometimes you don't even know that the toons aren't real! When sparks fly, you see the punches hit the animated guys; it's a perfect set. Most of the time, animated films don't get nominated for any Oscars. Who Framed Roge Rabbit got three and an honorary one.But be warned, this is not really a kid's film. Sure, it's got Roger Rabbit, Daffy Duck, Mickey Mouse, and everyone else from the WB and Disney shows, but its plot is so intricate, the kiddos will just be waiting for the next character. Keep in mind, a lot of the time there is a cartoon character in screen, and there is a visit to Toon Town, but they won't be able to follow the plot (I'm still not sure if I get it!).The characters are well-developed, even if they are intoduced only for this movie and are 'unknowns'. Hoskins is very good as drunk Valient, his ability to interact with 'other actors' is pretty good (or scary, take your pick). Christopher Lloyd, one of my favorite actors, is great as Judge Doom. Try comparing him to himself in 1985 in Back to the Future. See a giant difference? I do, at least.To sum it all up, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a marvelous achievement of animation blended with reality with terrific performances with lots of humor spreaded into it to make a fine, healthy picture that gets better every time you see it.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for some language, cartoon violence, and hard-to-follow plot",8,0,0,19 October 2002
Friday Night Lights," Friday Night Lights: 9/10
","In February, I saw a sports movie called Miracle. I didn't like it one bit. It was basically a clich√É¬©d, rah-rah-rah-go-America sports movie, with no purpose in it. With obvious reasons, Friday Night Lights will be compared to it. But there's a huge difference here. One's good, one isn't. Plain and simple like that. Every fault that was in Miracle is not evident in Friday Night Lights. Miracle focused in on the coach, yet tried to focus in on a few players, too. The result was a muddled mess, while here in Friday Night Lights, there is no central character, allowing the story to go in so many more directions.In the small, poverty-stricken town of Odessa, Texas, all the residents have is their local high-school football team. The oft-state championship-winning team, headed by Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), is going for another state title, thanks to their big star Boobie Miles (Derek Luke). But the team goes through injuries, hardships, and others, as the whole city is counting on them to win the states again.What makes Friday Night Lights so great is director Peter Berg. Most importantly, he takes a team that requires no sympathy whatsoever-they're state champions-and yet makes us root for them. How he does this, I'm not sure, but it's an amazing feat to accomplish. Also, a hand-held camera is used with great effect. It reminded me of Man on Fire used its camera. It kept on moving around and around, not being able to be still for a second, but here, it actually worked. It wasn't obtrusive, and it looked like it belonged. It wasn't nauseating at all. The camera also had a few 'novelty' shots, as I'll call them, which are overhead shots, crane shots, etc., which worked will in the story and the movie.What may be even better than the directing is the writing by David Aaron Cohen (based off of Buzz Bissinger's book). It may seem like a simple script at first, but then you can't place your finger on why you liked the movie so much. It's because the movie works amazingly well as basically a series of vignettes. Most scenes are short, or overlap each other, and at first seem to be pretty random, but they all fit together and make a coherent storyline. And then you realize that this is no ordinary football film. There's a bit of the slow-motion action shots, sure, and some inspirational music swelling up. But there's no central character, therefore, we can't say that the script deviated from the main character, which means that development would be lacking. We didn't find out as much as we could about these characters, but we found out enough. It's amazing how well a movie like this could work with stock characters, too. There's the kid living with a single mother, a kid with an abusive dad, and all of the above. Friday Night Lights focuses in on a few characters, lets us get to know them, and really works. We find out that we care about all of these characters, they're not larger than life or anything.Thornton was pretty good, but he's not the world's best actor, so we can't expect that much. The best, though is Derek Luke as Boobie. His performance is credible, and after coming off the mess that was Antwone Fisher, he redeems himself here. Friday Night Lights is hard to talk about in words, but it's a purely cinematic experience, one that you must see even if you hate sports movies.My rating: 9/10Rated PG-13 for thematic issues, sexual content, language, some teen drinking and rough sports action.",9,0,2,9 October 2004
Chinatown," Chinatown: 8/10
","Please note: I saw this movie edited for TV, so my review may have been different if I saw it unedited.Chinatown plays much like an old film-noir, except this is in color, which, for some reason, works very well. In it, Jack Nicholson plays Jake Gettes. He's a private dick and is hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to look at her husband, since she thinks he's cheating on her. He then gets involved in a murder case and something with losing water in L.A. (which was quite smaller in the 40's, I learned).Don't watch this alone! Actually, what I mean by that is watch it with someone else so you can ask them questions during the film. I'm glad I had that advantage. It's a really entertaining movie that also keeps you enthralled, not knowing what's going to happen next. Yet, it deservedly won its Best Original Screenply, which includes one-liners like: `Is that your phone number?' `I don't know, I don't call myself that often.' I laughed a couple times, which lightened the mood. I liked the mystery; I kept on guessing, but in the last half hour or so, I decided to just stop and let the entertainment speak for itself.Nicholson did a very good job, what with the sliced nose and all. He made me believe that he was a P.I. The camerawork, though nothing impressive, showed us the timepiece, and I really thought I was in the 40's, set in some old noir that came to color. I supposed that was director Roman Polanski's idea all along. By the way, Polanski has a cameo as the hood who slices Jake's nose. Dunaway seemed to be perfect for the part, at least on what I've seen in the few old noirs I've seen.The reason I didn't give Chinatown a higher rating is that I found myself playing with a paper clip a few times. I also wasn't really `thrilled' much, just into the mystery. The music was scarce but it was effective. I wish I could say more, but my memory's hazy, so I'll leave you with just saying `see it'!My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and violence.",8,1,3,18 February 2003
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Life of Brian: 7/10
","`The film so funny it was banned in Norway!' Life of Brian has been penned with that phrase in Sweden, because it was, because Norway believed it to be blasphemous. In an interview, they said that they didn't really consider it to be blasphemous, and I don't either. It's just funny, plain and simple.Brian is a baby born on the original Christmas. First, the three Wise Men accidentally go into his house, instead of Jesus'. Fast forward to the year 33 A.D., where Brian (Graham Chapman) is a regular Jew, who hates the Romans who take over and lives with his overbearing mother (Terry Jones). He falls into the hands of the People's Front of Judea and is fighting against the Romans. Soon he becomes mistaken for the Messiah. Well, at least it has more of a plot than The Meaning of Life.Better than Meaning of Life, not as funny as Holy Grail. During the first two thirds of the movie, the laughs came steadily. During the last part of the film, the laughs teetered off a little. And, since most of the plot is about Brian being mistaken for the Messiah, it came surprisingly late in the film, maybe around halfway. Of course, it couldn't be considered a Monty Python film if it didn't have the trademark animation. The opening credits (which also sported a better song than Meaning of Life) had kooky animation, as with the animation/claymation halfway through, where Brian gets `rescued' by a spaceship.Being a Latin student myself, I cracked up when Brian was writing graffiti and was corrected by a soldier about his grammar. I could actually understand what they were talking about! Something else that made me laugh out loud was when Brian went to buy something but was hounded to haggle. There were other funny scenes, and most of the movie was hit instead of miss¬Öthough a couple points didn't strike me as funny.During the interview I mentioned earlier, they ended by singing `Always Look on the Bright Side of Life', and I didn't know that it came from this movie. It was a humorous ending to the movie.Of course, all of the Monty Pythoners were in top condition, not showing any signs of weakness yet. I particularly like John Cleese and Eric Idle the most, with Idle seeming to come off best. The six main actors altogether had 40 parts! Beat that, Eddie Murphy! Other `regulars', such as Carol Cleveland and Neil Innes, did well also.Not the best, not the worst of the Monty Python movies, but Life of Brian isn't one to be missed.My rating: 7/10Rated R for nudity, religious themes, and language.",7,1,4,7 February 2003
Meet the Parents," Meet the Parents: 8/10
","I remember wanting to see this ever since the first trailer came out. I eagerly went to the movie theater on the evening with a friend who had come from Washington, and I was so disappointed when the showing, and the next one, was sold out. When I saw it about a couple weeks later, I understood why it had.Meet the Parents starts off with Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) saying a love-speech to a patient in the hospital where he nurses, to see how it sounds for his pop of the question later in the day. When a funny turn of events make him not say the speech, his girlfriend Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) is taking him to meet her parents before proposing.Greg obviously is nervous, and meeting Jack (Robert De Nero), Pam's dad, doesn't do anything to help. Robert De Nero has a knack for comedy, which seems to be his main thing nowadays. He's very good as the perceptive and yet naive father of teacher Pam.Blythe Danner, who is underused in the movie, plays Jack's loving wife, Dina, who likes Greg and doesn't like Jack digging so deep into Pam's boyfriend's lives. Greg gives the Byrnes a gift-a rare plant. Pam had told Greg that Jack was a retired florist; what Greg doesn't know is that Jack is actually a retired CIA agent, which makes sense, since Jack is less than thrilled at the gift. It's obvoius that Jack doesn't approve of Greg, but Dina and Pam tell him to take it easy on Greg. Yeah, right.Pam's sister, Deborah (Nicole DeHuff), is getting married to Dr. Bob Banks (Thomas McCarthy) in the Byrnes homestead while Jack is living there. Do you think the wedding will go flawless? One of the only things I don't like about Meet the Parents is that it has too many seconday characters, like Dr. Bob's father, Dr. Larry (James Rebhorn) and Bob's mother, Linda (Phyllis George). But if you don't really pay attention to those people (although they're needed later in the movie), it works better.As more and more mishaps happen by Greg, Jack more and more dislikes him. He pains to like, or at least tolerate, Greg for the women's sakes, but it's tough. Luckily he's got hidden cameras around the house to look at him 24-7. Why is it so funny? Because it's by the director of the Austin Powers series, Jay Roach. Although Meet the Parents doesn't have the randiness of Austin Powers, it still holds some laughs.Overall, Meet the Parents is a very funny movie that doesn't lack on plot and doesn't stoop to the Austin Powers level. The supporting characters leave something to be desired, but that doesn't even dent the otherwise wonderful and comedic movie that we have here.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for language, sexual humor, and drug refrences/content.",8,1,2,9 October 2002
Fight Club," Fight Club: 8/10
","In David Fincher's controversial and outstanding Fight Club, Edward Norton plays a person whose name we never find out. He has no life: he has a dead-end job, he orders IKEA furniture mail-order, and he becomes addicted to self-help groups. But Marla Singer (Helena Bohnam Carter) also goes to his groups, and the Narrator's condo gets burned down. And then he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).Tyler sells soap. And so the Narrator moves in with Tyler, and they soon find out that they have masochistic pleasures and start a 'Fight Club'. Every Saturday night people can pummel each other for fun. And the Narrator's life turns topsy-turvey.Lotsa fights, action scenes, dark humor, and awesome acting. Norton was exceptional as the Narrator. He really brought out the dullness of the character he was trying to show. Great job. Pitt was good but nothing to write home about. He did manage to tell us that he does have some acting talent, but wouldn't be half as famous if he was ugly. Carter really displayed some strong acting here. The supporting cast, including Meat Loaf and Jared Leto, has strong potential (yes, even Meat Loaf!).There was, in the superbly written script, a lot of dark humor. The early scenes, such as the Narrator and Marla arguing over which groups to attend, had a lot of the humor. The script, which enjoys to have great speeches by Pitt, was so well written. The over narration (which dominates most of the film) was excellent. I can't really describe it, there are no words.The movie works best when it's at its trippiest. The ending twist (which I unfourtanatly read about before) went out in more directions that I had thought. If there is one major flaw, it is that Fight Club doesn't really have a real plot. The opening part of the film is about the Narrator's life. The second part is the Fight Club. The third part is the scheme that Tyler has to branch off from Fight Club. And the final part is the ending. The excessive violence, in my opinion, was necessary to the movie and I wouldn't have cut anything out.Fight Club is an extremly entertaining movie with great acting and stunning visuals.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong violence, language, terrorist acts, and some sexuality.",7,0,2,26 November 2002
As Good as It Gets," As Good As It Gets: 10/10
","Nominated for seven Academy Awards and winner of two, As Good As It Gets is really as good as it gets. It has biting and sarcastic humor, sincere and poignant drama, and plausible romance (let me tell you, I bought Helen Hunt falling in love with Jack Nicholson more than her and Woody Allen in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion.) Directed by The Simpsons producer James L. Brooks, it really makes you laugh.Nicholson is Melvin Udall, a curmudgeon in his 60s who is also obsessive-compulsive. He has to lock his door, he flips the light switch five times, he can't touch anyone else, he can't step on cracks, and he repeatedly uses new bars of soap. His gay neighbor Simon (Greg Kinnear) is a painter who loves his little dog Verdell. Every morning, Melvin goes to his favorite restaurant, where only Carol Connely (Helen Hunt) is able to put up with him.While having somebody pose for a painting, Simon gets beaten and needs someone to look after Verdell. The only person left is Melvin. Of course, he can't show it, but he soon falls in love with the dog. When her son's illness causes Carol to miss work, Melvin doesn't know what to do. Soon they all bond and, as the song says, they `look on the bright side of life.'Upbeat music (which should have won the Oscar) makes this movie even greater. It's impossible not to tap along. Although not playing during all of the serious scenes, it really is great music that makes you feel good, which is what this movie is: a feel-good movie. Sure it gets heavy-handed at times, but it IS a comma (comedy-drama). As I mentioned before, it's biting, sarcastic, and hilarious. You can't go much without laughing at something Melvin says to either Simon or Carol and their equally wise wisecracks back. Also, I could tell that, at times, Nicholson was improvising, and that made the movie even funnier.Another Oscar that As Good As It Gets got screwed out of was best original script. It really had touching moments thrown in with the superb characterization and humor. You could sincerely feel good about any one of the characters, even Melvin. Nicholson, in this role, reminded me of his later role in About Schmidt. While I'm on the topic of acting, let me say Nicholson was amazing. He tried to keep his tough-guy person still with him, but he let go that he loves doing commas. He was excellent, proving that, once again, he's not finished with us yet! Hunt also deserved her Oscar, with crying that puts, well, actual crying to shame. Kinnear was also great, and so was everyone else, especially Cuba Gooding Jr.I would highly suggest seeing As Good As It Gets before long, because it is a great movie!My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 on appeal for strong language, thematic elements, nudity and a beating.",10,0,1,9 March 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of the Dead: 8/10
","I hate remakes, especially unnecessary ones. There's no reason for them to exist, and unless it goes into a completely new direction (kind of like a 're-imagining', like Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes), it's worthless. Yet I found myself going to see the new, ultra-violent version of George A. Romero's classic horror movie Dawn of the Dead. I haven't seen the original (the only movie of the original Dead series I've seen is the first one, Night of the Living Dead), but I can tell that the original was nowhere near as violent and gory, and probably had more social commentary than the thin layer that's in this version, but it's probably not as scary and entertaining as this version.Ana (Sarah Polley) is forced to take refuge in the local mall after a zombie killed her husband. There, she meets up with other survivors, such as Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Michael (Jake Weber), and Andre (Mekhi Phifer). Along the way (as they have to keep the zombies out of the mall), a baby must be born, dogs have to run through hoards of zombies, and much, much more. Let the fun begin.Dawn of the Dead could have gone terribly, terribly wrong, like it's half-cousin 28 Days Later. With all of this blood and maiming, freshman director Zack Snyder could have focused too much on making the blood sensible while still having shock value. However, Dawn is actually scary. It's not continuously scary, but many scenes were, and, unlike 28 Days, they didn't last for just five seconds. And even better (compared to other recent horror movies), all of the scares weren't either just 'jump' scares, or began by that. One problem I had, though, was that so many characters became involved towards the middle that it was impossible to guess the order in which everyone would die.There's lots to say about mindless people clamoring to get into a mall in terms of social statements. Is this what we've become? Yes it is, but this takes second podium to the buckets of blood and crazy zombie killing. I don't really consider myself a gorehound, but I expect that when people get killed, there's blood (re: Halloween), but, obviously, this movie is not realistic. This is what a horror movie should be: scary, bloody, funny, and filled with Ving Rhames.I do have a few qualms with this movie, though. First, I found it annoying how the camera switched from film to handheld, making no connection between the two and making it hard to watch at times. Second, random characters just jump in at inconsequential times. Lastly, it loses track of where it's going towards the third act, but other than that, I would call Dawn of the Dead one of the best horror movies of this millennium so far.My rating: 8/10Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality.",8,0,1,4 April 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun of the Dead: 8/10
","So we've had the Dead trilogy by George Romero-Night of the Living, Dawn of the, and Day of the. Since then, there haven't been many big zombie movies, save for the remakes of Night and Dawn. A Day remake is in the works. But last year we got 28 Days Later, a pretentious wanna-be zombie movie that I still enjoyed. But as a complete parody, we haven't really had any movies. That is, until Shaun of the Dead came around. It's a no-holds-barred comedy/horror, with some of the obvious social commentary that both Dawns had. But really, it's not even a spoof, just a zomromcom, as I believe the director wanted it to be called. And it's just what this world needs.Shaun (Simon Pegg, also the co-writer) is the senior salesperson at an electronic store at age 29. He lives with his roommates, slacker Ed (Nick Frost) and uptight Pete (Peter Serafinowicz). None are really going anywhere in life, and Shaun's girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) just broke up with him. Then zombies start to walk the earth, and Shaun and Ed have to go and knock them zombies back to hell.In the first 15 minutes, the movie gives off this bleak, uninviting vibe. The social satire is strong, but the laughs and excitement are not. Then soon after, the movie completely changes gears into this gory, hilarious send-up of not just zombie movies but horror movies in general. The body count is high, blood runs through like an erupting volcano, British accents are thick, yet it's a movie that you can't help liking. The humor is varied-from the dialogue, from the images, from the situations, from the parodies, from the effects, from just about anything. There's some great, memorable sequences in there, such as the hitting of the zombie with the pool cues, and the absurdity of the whole movie makes Shaun about equal to the Dead series. Maybe it will become part of the 'official' series. But the whole cast has great chemistry (many have been on the British TV show Spaced), and the characters are just normal people. At times, an Office Space-ish vibe was given off. The character of Shaun was a likable guy and everything, and it's the normal people we relate to in these 'tense' situations.The entire parody was great, with a bunch of random jumps thrown in there for no reason whatsoever. I hate to say this about a zomromcom, but at times the atmosphere was pretty creepy. I wouldn't go so far as to call it scary, but for a comedy it was somewhat intense. The movie was well shot, with nothing unusual or any hand-held camera movements or anything of the like. Straightforward directing, by co-writer Edgar Wright, makes the movie watchable. Also, the acting was believable, and, at times, over-the-top (see Shaun's reactions when he first sees the zombies). But the nihilism of the Shaun character worked, especially when he walks through the town not realizing that everyone is a zombie. There's some crazy stuff happening here, and it's some of funniest stuff you'll see this year in theaters. Even if you don't like horror movies or blood-and-guts movies, I'd recommend it. You'll laugh no matter what.My rating: 8/10Rated R for zombie violence/gore and language.",8,0,1,2 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl: 6/10
","For some reason, I've never liked Johnny Depp. Ever since I saw him die in A Nightmare on Elm Street and I was glad, I wasn't a Depp fan. However, as Captain Jack Sparrow, not only is he able to deliver snappy one-liners, he proves to BE the movie. If it wasn't for Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl wouldn't have a tongue-in-cheek feel; it would just seem like it was a serious pirate movie, which, by Jove, it isn't. There's nothing in it that's remotely bound to happen.The story, which was based on a Disney World ride, has Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, aka the hot girl from Bend it Like Beckham) with a golden medallion, and bloodthirsty pirates come to kidnap her for it. If regular `yo-ho-ho' pirates weren't enough, they're zombie/ghost/skeleton pirates that cannot be killed. However, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, who was added into this movie just so teenage girls would see it and swoon over him), who's smitten with her, tries to rescue her with the help of Cpt. Jack Sparrow (Depp). Soon they're in way over their head.As the previews for this movie started to come out, I had my doubts. I thought that this was going to be the worst movie of the summer, with a plot more contrived that Anger Management. Zombie pirates? Ech. Also, my grudge against Johnny Depp held me back. However, after hearing mainly positive reviews, and learning that Depp was actually good, I thought that I'd give it a try. And it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's not a piece of art, but it's a movie I wouldn't mind seeing again.The plot is, frankly, really stupid. Like most movies of the summer, they focus too much on having a plot instead of having two hours of rollicking fun. However, Pirates of the Caribbean tries to have a real deep, moving plot, while it suffers with it. It bogs down the fun that we could be having. Also, while all of the fight scenes were pretty good, there were too many√Ç‚Ä¶not to say boring, but not exciting scenes.Depp was pretty funny, but he also proved himself to be a welcome screen presence. I found myself amazed to actually be WANTING more Depp. If you've seen any trailers for Pirates of the Caribbean, which I think everyone in the country has, you know what he'll be like. However, I must object to the casting of Bloom. Just because he can be considered easy on the eyes doesn't make him a good actor, and he isn't. Every time he was onscreen, I was waiting for him to leave so Depp can do more onscreen. However, Gore `The Ring' Verbinski thought that somehow he wouldn't receive as much money if the reason half of the audience went to the theater wasn't on screen a lot, so in about every place, Orlando Bloom is on screen. Knightley, who was billed fourth and had the most screen time, was pretty good, but I think that she should stick to comedy.Even if you hate Disney (as I do), you'll be able to find something to like about the first PG-13 `straight Disney' film, whether it be the tongue-in-cheek humor, the few good swashbuckling scenes, or the horrible plot.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for action/adventure violence.",6,0,1,12 July 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut: 7/10
","Most TV shows that are made into movies usually suck. However, every once in a while, a TV show-movie comes along that has fans awe-struck, and that's what South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is. If you love the series, you'll love the movie. If you're like me and enjoy the show but don't find it hilarious, that's the same as what you'll think of the movie. If you think it's deplorable for its language and curse anyone who watches, well√Ç‚Ä¶stay away from this movie.Surprisingly short and entertaining, it's also surprisingly a musical. Although it boasts famous songs like `Blame Canada' and `Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat B**ch', they're all basically the same. They are, however, memorable and unexpected. I don't religiously watch the show, but occasionally I do and have a laugh at it. It's basically what you'd expect from a 30-minute crudely animated TV show. It's a fast-paced movie that has four kids from South Park, Colorado, who try to stop the United States from waging war against Canada. In it is childhood love, Conan O'Brian committing suicide, V-chips, and much more.Paramount must have paid the Guinness World Record people a lot of money, because it holds a record for `most swearing in an animated movie'. There are 399 curse words (about 128 F-words) and 128 offensive gestures, and I saw it uncut on Comedy Central. It's probably going to make Comedy Central receive its highest ratings, but I don't really see why. It's funny at times, very funny, but it isn't consistent, and the plot moves too quickly for its own good.The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who also wrote the film, voiced most of the main characters, who all sounded the same. At times, it was hard to understand what the characters were saying, but the animation was a little better than the TV series. However, nobody would care about that. All they want to do is laugh, and I think there are better movies than this to do that in, but if you see South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, you won't be disappointed, or not much.My rating: 7/10Rated R for pervasive vulgar language and crude sexual humor, and for some violent images.",7,2,2,5 July 2003
Coffee and Cigarettes," Coffee and Cigarettes: 7/10
","Movies almost always follow a three act structure. Any that don't are usually considered avante-garde, and fail to get a receiving audience. Art house favorite Jim Jarmusch's latest film Coffee and Cigarettes doesn't follow that three act structure, but it's not as if people would flock to it anyway. And since Coffee and Cigarettes isn't linear, neither will this review. The movie's composed of 11 short sketches, all having to do with coffee and cigarettes. No other characters besides the main ones are seen (an aspect I liked), and the movie's filmed in some ultra-cool black and white.In 'Strange to Meet You', Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright randomly meet up in a coffee shop. Steven talks about how he drinks coffee before he sleeps, and they both are on obvious addictions to the title things. Steven mentions that he doesn't want to go to his dentist appointment, something that Roberto gladly does for him. This sketch is just kind of random (as all of them are)-they seem to have agreed to meet, yet don't know each other and have no purpose for meeting. The stuff discussed here will be discussed later, and as cool as Benigni is, there's just not really much of interest in this one.Joie Lee, Cinqu√© Lee, and Steve Buscemi, in 'Twins', are all great. Lee and Lee, twins, drink their coffee and chatterbox waiter Buscemi comes up to talk to them about how Elvis isn't actually dead-it's his twin. It's funny, it's entertaining, and it has Steve Buscemi in it. The Lees are also quite good for people I had never heard of. I think the key to this one was the coordination of the three of them, and it worked perfectly. One of my favorites from Coffee and Cigarettes.Tom Waits and Iggy Pop talk about smoking, IHOP and Taco Bell, and various other things in 'Somewhere in California'. Some of the dialogue sounds almost like something Larry David would say ('Do I look like a Taco Bell kind of guy?'), and it's also quite funny. The last line is a great line, and the battling egos are fun to watch. It's probably the one with the least substance in it, but I liked it nonetheless.'Those Things'll Kill Ya'-Joe Rigano and Vinny Vella talk about the addiction of cigarettes, when Vinny, Jr. comes in and asks for money. It's not interesting, is filled with no-names, and has no real purpose of existing. It's not witty, it's not observant, it's just there. It's like some other of the middle sketches-it's just bland, no distinctive characteristics to them.In 'Rene√©', Renee French is a tomboyish kind of woman, reading about gun racks and such. She also is a perfectionist, and when the waiter (E.J. Rodriguez) pours her more coffee, she becomes belligerent. See comments about 'Those Things'll Kill Ya'.Alex (Alex Descas) and Isaach (Isaach De Bankol√©) meet in a restaurant after Alex calls Isaach. Isaach thinks something's wrong with Alex, but really Alex just wants to talk. Yet another of the 'middle' sketches. Although you could say there's no point to the movie in general, there's especially no point in this one. Is it to show the paranoia of America? Or to outline the distrust we have in each other? Or is there just no reason for it at all?In 'Cousins', Cate Blanchett plays both a successful publicist and her estranged cousin, who meet for coffee. The rifts between the two are evident, as one is successful and one isn't. The more I think about it, the more I like it, although at the time it seems unimpressive. Everything that's said in that one is true, too, once you think about it. Might not be the most entertaining of the 11, but still a worthwhile one.Jack and Meg White of The White Stripes talk about Tesla coils. Yawn.Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan meet in 'Cousins?', where Alfred brings up the point that they're distantly related. It's the longest out of all of them, for good reason, as it's fun to watch, and is probably second in the humor scale (next to 'Delirium'). The way the tables turn at the end is a great twist, and actually shows the way of life in some Hollywood celebrities. It strays off of the topic, but it goes into interesting sidetracks. ('I love going to LA. I love leaving it even more.') The one you're probably expecting to be the best, and you may think so.In 'Delirium', the craziest out of all of them, GZA and RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, after swearing off caffeine, meet Bill Murray (as a waiter, no less) at a caf√®. They talk about how bad caffeine is, and how GZA is into alternative medicine, which culminates the skit in a morbidly hilarious way. It's easily the funniest of the 11, with all three of them being the stars. The way that GZA and RZA idolize Murray, and the complete absurdity of Murray being a waiter are comic genius. For me, the best one by far.Lastly, in 'Champagne', Bill Rice and Taylor Mead talk about imagining that their coffee is champagne. The sappiest of the 11, it's okay, but not really akin to my liking. Still, it's some people's favorite.Overall, some of the parts of Coffee and Cigarettes are pure genius, whether hilarious or not. However, the other part of the time it just fizzles out to mediocrity. Still, I'd recommend watching at least a few of these segments, but maybe not in a row. There's no need to watch all of them.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.",7,1,2,12 November 2004
Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man 2: 8/10
","The summer of 2003 was the summer of the crappy sequel. Stuff like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Legally Blonde came out, did marginal box office to dismal reviews, and then left. 2004 seems to be the summer of the huge sequels. They're universally acclaimed, like Shrek 2 (except by me), and do huge box office. Spider-Man 2 seems to belong to the latter group. Not just because it was released in 2004, but it is a worthy sequel to 2002's Spider-Man. It seems more cinematic, and knows where it's going more than the first one did.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), after being bitten by a genetically altered spider in the first, has powers of a spider and uses them to stop crime in New York. But Peter's grades are falling, he loses his job, and ultimately has to choose between being Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He chooses the former, but at about the same time, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) performs an experiment that goes wrong, causing four tentacles to be fused onto his back, hence the name Dr. Octopus. He and Spider-Man fight.The special effects, supposedly improved from the first, seemed hit-or-miss. Much of the CGI looked more obvious, whether it be Spider-Man's webslinging (he often looked fake) and the green screen. However, Doc Ock's tentacles were much better than the other CGI effect, and made the character a whole lot more interesting than the Green Goblin. I was one of the few who didn't complain about the Green Goblin in the first, but Doc Ock was just more developed and seemed more like a menacing villain here. Plus, Molina did a better job as the villain than Willem Dafoe did in the first (although I did like his 'comeback' here).However, it seemed like Doc Ock was all but forgotten for much of the movie. The plot, instead of centering around Spider-Man, centers around Peter and his conflicts. Sure, he has to decide between which he wants to be, but mostly it's about Peter's relationships. I'm cool with that, except there was barely any action in the movie. A couple fight scenes, but those mainly consisted of Spider-Man and Doc Ock punching each other. Why not use your powers to save yourself? I must admit, when they did use their powers, it was a lot better than the first, mainly because the villain was better. I also appreciated the more mature style of the whole movie. After re-watching the first, it seemed pandered for children, while this one seemed more mature.The script takes its time, allowing the relationships to deepen between the characters. There's some great scenes that don't really involve Spider-Man at all (such as Peter and Aunt May at the table), but at times, you're just waiting for something action related to come up. I'm not even sure if this could be considered an action movie, with the scarcity of the action scenes. But it definitely is a super-hero movie, and a worthy one at that. Sam Raimi knows his stuff, and creates a conglomeration of everything-some action, mainly drama, but homages to his Evil Dead series, King Kong, and even Maguire back injury that almost caused him to not star in this movie. Although Bryan Singer's X-Men may have started the whole comic book craze, Raimi's direction of the Spider-Man movies made the good ones what they are today. To that, I think he deserves a lot of credit.Maguire, again, is pretty good, but I can't stop thinking about what Jake Gyllenhaal (his replacement while Maguire's back was injured) would have been like in the role. Probably better, since he did play a superhero in Donnie Darko. Kirsten Dunst, as love interest Mary Jane, is almost universally panned, but I find no fault with her acting. But, as I said before, Molina shines here. It's obvious he's having the most fun with his role, along with whatever acting chops are necessary, and the combination's staggering. He's come a long way from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Is Spider-Man 2 the best comic book movie? No, I think that goes to The Hulk. Is it the best comic book movie sequel? It is so far, until (hopefully) The Hulk 2 is made.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for stylized action violence.",8,0,0,4 July 2004
Billy Elliot," Billy Elliot: 7/10
","Have you ever been criticized for something you enjoyed doing? Then you'll see how close to a real life Billy Elliot can be.Jamie Bell plays the title character, son of Jackie (Gary Lewis), brother of Tony (Jamie Draven), grandson of Grandma (Jean Heywood). Jackie and Tony are coal-miners who are on strike, but continue to give Billy fifty pence a week for boxing lessons. When he accidentally goes into a ballet lesson instead, he enjoys it, much to his father's dismay. Billy has to undergo ridiculing from both his friends and family.Touchingly beautiful, and yet selfishly self-conscious. Its wonderful story seems to be so real and so vivid, with sincere emotions. However, it knows that its touching and tries to cash in on them. It tried to be too many things (and wanted us to believe that all of them it were): drama, comedy, thriller, romance. It only completed on one of them: drama. Its drama was real and lifelike, but it seemed to try too hard for laughs (which they didn't succeed for me), and put in a 'fight scene', so to speak, for thrills. A character that comes in for a couple scenes has a psuedo-romance with Billy. It would have been a lot better if they had thrown her in more, so then they could play on the romance quality of it, which isn't much.Its story did have substance, don't get me wrong. Very multilayered. Billy's dancing, the strike, his cross-dressing friend. All of the subplots were developed just enough for you to enjoy them.Bell gives a shockingly great breakthrough performance. Look for him to be in more starring roles. The rest of the cast were basically unknown to us Yanks, but they were all very good, as well. I especially thought Lewis was great.The story of Billy Elliot seems far-fetched, but it is true to life. It could happen to any one of us. I think that's what makes it so good.

Finding Nemo," Finding Nemo: 6/10
","The line between fantasy and reality is becoming rapidly blurred. It seems that all computer-animated movies are doing extremely well, while the hand-drawn ones seem to be either direct-to-video sequels nobody wanted, box office bombs, or have horrendous ideas. Finding Nemo may soon be the highest grossing animated movie ever, simply because it's easy to look at. It's not as good as Pixar's other movies because it lacks the one key ingredient that made Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. work so well. Most kids never feared of being taken away by a man and being put into a fish tank in a dentist's office. However, I don't think there's a child alive who never thought that their toys moved when they weren't there or that there were monsters in the closet. Because of this, Finding Nemo couldn't connect as well, because, simply, it wasn't something that anyone thought of in real life.The plot has Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clownfish who can never tell good jokes, with his wife Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) (where DO they get these names?), who just moved into a new home. A shark, however, eats Coral and all but one of her eggs. A few years later, Marlin raises Nemo (Alexander Gould) in an overprotective environment. To prove his dad wrong, Nemo swims out into the open ocean and is scooped up by a diver. Marlin goes on a search to find Nemo, and, along the way, meets over-the-top Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss.Finding Nemo has lavish landscapes. It really looks like the ocean, and, although none of the fish or creatures in the ocean looked real, they were well done. The best animation that Pixar does is with real things (like in the opening short, Knick Knack). Although they have some work to do with humans to make them look realistic, a few scenes, set in a doctor's office, looked incredibly real. Maybe if Pixar and PDI (who did Shrek) exchange secrets than Pixar could have better looking humans and PDI could have more realistic surroundings.The only character that made me constantly laugh in this comedy was Dory. Although most of the target audience would not understand most of it, her short-term memory loss was a genius addition to the script. She was so uninhibited, it was really hilarious. However, Brooks, as Marlin, didn't really do much for me. If his ability to not be able to tell a joke had been played out more, it would've worked more. His paranoid behavior also ebbed and flowed, while if he had another quirk that he could do throughout the movie, would've worked more, also. The fun part about animated movies is all of the voices. I couldn't tell most of them, but I did recognize Willem Dafoe. Others include Allison Janney, Brad Garrett, Erik Per Sullivan, Stephen Root, Vicki Lewis, and Geoffrey Rush.There's not a real moral to Finding Nemo. What is there to learn? All I've learned is from the opening credits that snowmen desperately want to leave their snowglobes. Basically, Finding Nemo won't go into the same category as Toy Story or Monsters, Inc.. Instead, it'll probably go into the `forgotten' category like A Bug's Life.My rating: 6/10Rated G.",6,1,2,1 August 2003
Constantine," Constantine: 7/10
","Did you see Exorcist: The Beginning? Neither did most people, but I found it to be a creepy drama with great acting and terrible direction. Francis Lawrence's Constantine is the opposite: there's terrible acting and good direction. Both are similar to each other in plots: they're both supernatural thrillers about demon-fighters. They both also star actors who are pretty cool, and both movies are pretty creepy. That's why I liked both about the same.John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) tried to kill himself when he was younger and was literally seconds away from death and going to Hell. As an adult, he wants to get into heaven, and tries to do that by sending as many demons back to Hell as possible. He meets Angela (Rachel Weisz), whose twin sister committed suicide, and Constantine has to go and figure out what happened. Things get hairier, and there's Pruitt Taylor Vince. Need I say more? Constantine had a budget of about $100 million, and it shows. There's a lot of great images here, and about half the budget obviously went to Venetian blinds. The movie looked great, mainly thanks to Lawrence, who debuted with this movie. The opening scene, in particular, sticks with me. It's a typical scene that seems to be in all heaven/Hell dramas (an exorcism), but Lawrence's spin on it is truly unique, and makes it quite exciting. The movie is enthralling through its typical runtime (any comedy is 90 minutes and any drama/thriller is 120 minutes, no questions asked), and oftentimes quite exciting.No one will doubt that Keanu Reeves was amazing in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. However, ever since that, everyone's realized that he can't really act. Stellan Skarsgaard in Exorcist was a lot better. Still, Reeves is pretty cool as Constantine, and you need to be a certain cool for this movie. He may not be the best actor, but he's cool nonetheless. Weisz does a pretty good job, too. Djimon Hounsou, the breakout star from that mediocre movie that everyone thought would win a bunch of Oscars but ended up flailing In America, shows up as a paranormal...guy...thing. His role's not really explained, but it's pretty cool (as is the guy's who lives in the back of the bowling alley). And Pruitt Taylor Vince.People will dismiss Constantine as just a simple February release, trying to ride the coattails of Exorcist: The Beginning or something like that. Don't believe them. Although hardly original, Constantine is an enthralling, entertaining two hour thrill ride. And there's Vince.My rating: 7/10 Rated R for violence and demonic images.",7,2,5,20 March 2005
Troy," Troy: 8/10
","Epics are scarce now. We have a few wanna-be epics (like Master and Commander; I'm not counting the Lord of the Rings movies because, well, I don't feel that they are), but nothing substantial. And although we won't be able to get another Ben-Hur or The Ten Commandments, we have great ones coming out this summer. Troy is one of them. It clocks in a little over two-and-a-half hours, but has all of the makings of an epic-characters, plot, excitement.Based off Homer's The Iliad, sans most of the polytheism, Troy begins with Achilles (Brad Pitt) killing the opposing army's strongest man in one blow of the sword. Then the Greek army, led by Agamemnon (Brian Cox), goes to invade Troy and enlarge the Greek empire even more. However, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) sends the army there because Paris (Orlando Bloom) captured his wife Helen (Diane Kruger) and took her to Troy. Now the two armies (Agamemnon's and Achilles's, since Achilles does not fight for Agamemnon) go to fight against the Trojan army.What really sold me about the movie was not the great acting (for the most part), or the action scenes, but the technical aspects. The locations were beautiful, as were all of the sets. I see where most of the famed $200 million went. Also, the cinematography was amazing-the things that could be done with the camera were very surprising. I was also surprised that the editing was not too choppy, which showed me that director Wolfgang Petersen did not want to make this for the MTV generation-this could be something that could live on for a long time.I had mixed feelings on David Benioff's (25th Hour) script. Mostly, it kept the movie exciting, even during the parts others felt were boring, and it seemed to move the movie along. It was well-written and seemed plausible. However, there was one thing that really irked me. That was one scene in which Achilles was crying. I can understand how a normal person would cry in that situation, but Achilles is a tough-as-nails guy! It's like seeing James Bond cry. It just discredits the whole thing.Despite others, I felt that Pitt was very good in his role-he seemed to get this part down well. He obviously put a lot of time into his role. Eric Bana, as Hector, did a great job, too. But now I must come to Orlando Bloom. I've always felt he was over-exposed for no reason, and Troy backs that up. When saying his lines, it seems like he wasn't doing anything with them. I was convinced that he was talking like English was a foreign language. His character did nothing for me-he was almost as annoying as Johnny Depp's character in Secret Window. He knows nothing of life, yet he forces the destruction of everyone around him. I wish someone had defenestrated him. As for the 'old men talking' (there's a quote in the film saying, 'War is young men dying and old men talking'), all of them were good but not memorable.The fighting scenes were amazing. All of those extras, everything so exact. It's a shame that this film has been getting mediocre reviews. Those $200 million well-spent will go to waste.My rating: 8/10Rated R for graphic violence and some sexuality/nudity.",8,0,1,15 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After Tomorrow: 7/10
","Summer releases released in May usually don't sustain for the whole summer. Take a look at last year's examples, like The Matrix Reloaded. A month after its release you could barely find it anywhere. That might happen to The Day After Tomorrow, but it's better than those mediocre action movies we got last year. The previews for The Day After Tomorrow made the movie out to be a movie with spectacular special effects and a decent story to tie it all together. For once, the trailers tell the truth.Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a paleoclimatologist (what a distinguished job!) who predicts that major weather changes will occur in 100 to 1000 years. No one believes him (of course!), but soon afterwards, the climate does start to change. The oceans flood, causing distress in much of the northern hemisphere, including Jack's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), who's currently in New York, waiting out the storm in a library. Jack decides to go from Washington, D.C. to New York to get his son.The special effects were more than what they looked on that stupid 10 minute preview on Fox. They were amazing. The special effects-and the effects that it had on the citizens of New York-looked very real. It brought that fact that this global warming could occur to us at anytime. Director Roland Emmerich can really use these special effects at the perfect time for the best effect. They are some of the most realistic effects I have ever seen in movies.Usually in movies like this, there's a seesaw effect. The better the effects, the worse the script. Amazingly enough, Tomorrow's script wasn't half bad. Although it did have the typically cheesy dialogue ('He's a straight-A student, he doesn't fail classes!'), the amount of characters generally stays small, and it doesn't blow the movie out of proportion. A few humorous characters are thrown in, and the script's representations of the President and Vice-President (dead-on characterizations of our current ones) are very funny. The script does go for pathos and stereotypes a little, though. Jack's wife Lucy (Sela Ward) is a doctor caring for a boy with cancer when the storm happens, so we are supposed to feel bad for the boy. When we see the effects in Japan, all we see are drunk Japanese businessmen. The worst, though, is what made me not watch the rest of the second season of 24. Wolves escape from a zoo and end up on a Russian ship in New York where Sam and co. go to look for supplies. If that isn't stupid, I don't know what is. One last thing I didn't like about the script: there was no sense of time. Scenes took place right after each other with no way of telling how much time had taken place in between.It's no wonder why The Alamo failed at the box office. Because of Dennis Quaid. He comes off of his best work in The Rookie to do The Alamo, Cold Creek Manor, and Tomorrow. He just doesn't seem to work here. While watching Gyllenhaal, I realized how much I was looking forward to the re-release of Donnie Darko this summer, so I could see him in a movie where he acted well. But I put this all beside me as I was being constantly entertained at The Day After Tomorrow, probably the only good action movie of this summer.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for intense situations of peril.",7,0,0,31 May 2004
The Terminator," The Terminator: 7/10
","The Terminator may be the action movie with the most quotable lines, such as `I'll be back,' `Come with me if you want to live,' and `F**k you, a**hole.' Not only that, it's remained one of the most popular action films of the last twenty years, it's continued to delight young and old alike. Added to the mix is icon Arnold Schwarzenegger, and you have yourself one fun romp through both the present and the future.When offered his job in The Terminator, Schwarzenegger was supposed to play good guy Kyle Reese, who became Michael Biehn. Schwarzenegger then played The Terminator, a cyborg from the future that came to the present (aka 1984) to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose son Michael would start in a giant war, etc. You'll figure out the plot as you go along for the ride.The Terminator has something that most action movies now need: action! Instead of PG-13ing it and making it look hokey, James Cameron decided to make it as lifelike as could be, and it really did look lifelike. The effects on Schwarzenegger when he was half-human, half-cyborg looked very real, and would be considered impressive by today's standards. Not being a gigantic gore fan, I did cringe a little, but it was very cool.My rating: 7/10Rated R for violence/gore, some language, and brief nudity.",7,1,3,30 June 2003
The Terminator," The Terminator: 6/10
","Arnold Schwarzenegger won't be known for his winning of Mr. Universe, etc. He's known for his phrase 'I'll be back', which was made famous from The Terminator.He plays The Terminator, a cyborg who comes from the future to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), an innocent waitress who doesn't believe Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) about that story. Reese also came from the future, but to protect Sarah from The Terminator, for reasons that come into detail later in the story.Schwarzenegger is fun as The Terminator. He only has about 10 lines to say in the entire movie, but I liked him in his futuristic role. Terminator is his most famous movie. It has action coming out the wazoo, but no real thrills. The 108 minute run-time seemed to go by quickly.The special FX, for 1984, were pretty good. Despite what it seemed, the exo-skeleton at the end was not stop-motion as it looked like, it was an animatronic puppet. The explosions looked real, so did all the shootings, and everything else. Biehn was very good as the guy from the future. He seemed to know what he was doing. I wonder why he hasn't been in much lately, though.Hamilton was good, too, as Sarah, but nothing to write home about. Terminator has set an example for others to follow in action movies. Many spoof movies have the 'terminator sight', and say 'I'll be back', and all the other catch phrases from the movie. I thought it also had some good places of humor, like all movies should. It is entertaining, also. The dreary look at the future seems almost farcical now, since we now know that there won't be a nuclear war around 1990. So that means it's a little outdated, but it's still fun (if lacking thrills), and recommended.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence and some language.",7,1,3,10 October 2002
Hotel Rwanda," Hotel Rwanda: 8/10
","Whenever anyone mentions the Oscar-nominated (and hopefully winning) Hotel Rwanda, they (present company included) feel obliged to sing a parody of The Eagles's 'Hotel California'. Both are rather similar, actually. Both deal with destruction, whether it be small or massive, as is the case with Hotel Rwanda. I knew little of the Rwandan genocide (all of my information had come from a 6th grade teacher-her son was in Rwanda during the aftermath). Although movies can never not have a bias, I feel like seeing Hotel Rwanda was necessary in learning about something I otherwise wouldn't've. Plus, there's Don Cheadle.Cheadle is Paul Rusesabagina, the owner of a high-scale hotel in Rwanda for rich white tourists. During this, the Hutus and Tutsis are in the middle of a genocide, leaving no one out of danger. Paul and his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo) open up their hotel to any refugees (whether they be Tutsi or Hutu), as Nick Nolte comes in and attempts to shake off the heroin he shot up during the filming of The Good Thief.Hotel Rwanda shows the true inhumanity man can have onto man. It opens up the door for people to examine how people treat each other. Showing how personally brutal this genocide was to the Rusesabaginas, and how it should have been to everyone else. The movie did an outstanding job of yelling at us Westerners for not really caring about Rwanda at that time (and we still really don't). There's not really much I can say on this movie. Everything stands out about it, especially Cheadle. If he wasn't up against Jamie Foxx for the Oscars, I'd root for him. But then there's the case of Sophie Okonedo. I really don't know what bugged me about her, but it just ruined the movie for me. Instead of this toweringly powerful film, it's just a very good one because of Sophie Okonedo. I really don't know what it was, but I recommend you see it and tell me.My rating: 8/10 Rated PG-13 on appeal for violence, disturbing images and brief strong language.",8,1,3,26 February 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Ocean's Twelve: 6/10
","It's inevitable, isn't it? After the success of the remake of Ocean's Eleven, out comes the sequel three years later. I liked the style of the teaser trailer (and was probably one of the only ones who didn't mind the name), so naturally, I was looking forward to the movie. Naturally, it's a sequel, so it's inferior to the original (which I liked more than the original of the original). The entire cast is back (plus one more, obviously) for the necessary foreign-country locations and trendy scene transitions. There's the constant music, the people with the general European accents (well, villains), and every other caper movie clich√© in the books.Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his eleven/twelve compadres are forced to pay back the money that they stole from Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) casinos three years earlier. To get the money, they have to steal it in Europe.Where the first movie was fun, this sequel was mildly entertaining. It went on a little long, but was never boring. It's watchable (as all crime movies like these should be), but not really entertaining. I wasn't having fun while watching a lot of Ocean's Twelve. I wasn't bored, either. I was in Limbo of the movie world. All of the Vegas glitz added to the first, and here it's drab European backgrounds. Steven Soderbergh's directing also makes the film harder to enjoy. The film's choppy-we don't see events that happened until after the fact (if that makes any sense), and there are so many subplots and characters with similar sounding names that eventually we stop caring. Whenever a movie makes me do that, I usually focus more in on the fun aspects of the movie. And sure, the movie had its fun moments, and never left me bored, but overall, it just lacked that ultra-cool style that the first one had.Then again, every actor's back in cool form. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the newbie here, and although her character is barely defined, she still manages to be cool. George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt (being on screen probably more than anyone else), Matt Damon-they're all cool. But it's obvious that this isn't the best sequel that could have been made for Ocean's Eleven-the movie was originally written for a completely different movie, and then readapted to a sequel. Because of that, there aren't really any reminders on who these people were. I remembered Clooney, Roberts, Garcia, and a few character names and quirks (such as Pitt's obsessive eating), but, really, who were these people? Did Soderbergh think that we would all rush out to see the first one before seeing this? I'll bet as many people did that as the number who went to see the Russian Solyaris after Soderbergh made Solaris.The caper this time around isn't as interesting (the major one doesn't come in until halfway through), nor as easy to follow. In fact, the whole movie's basically a convoluted mess. The subplot about Isabel's father, things like that...if there's a definition of worthless, that's it. Also, that 'Julia Roberts' bit went on for too long. We got the joke there. At that moment, I think that the movie thought it was funny enough to abandon basically the entire plot and go with a ten minute schtick, when there was basically no other humor in the movie. Still, Ocean's Twelve isn't terrible, and can offer a good time if you're the right person.My rating: 6/10 Rated PG-13 for language.",6,114,183,15 December 2004
Snatch," Snatch.: 8/10
","In a recent issue of Premiere magazine, The Italian Job director F. Gary Gray called Snatch. the greatest heist movie ever. It has numerous twists and turns, and, like all good heist films, you don't know what's going to happen at the end. However, for Snatch., I had no idea what happened during the entire movie! Guy `Swept Away' Ritchie directed this snazzy, modern crime film, but isn't consistent all the way through.Although it sounds like I didn't like the film, I did. A lot. What appealed to me was Ritchie's boldness to do weird camera tricks and shots. (Please keep in mind that I have not seen Ritchie's previous critically acclaimed work Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.) At times, mainly during the heist scene at the bank, shots were flipped upside down, and weird transitions were used. It looked really cool and modern. Also, despite the often voice-overs (usually by Jason Statham's Turkish), a quick and effective way of transition was used. It was used a few times, when characters were changing countries, and I really liked it. You'll recognize it.In this convoluted script, which was also quite funny, Turkish tells us that he's under interrogation with his friend Tommy (Stephen Graham). He tells us of a diamond heist, with a group that includes famous robber Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro), and the subsequent hunt for the 84-karat diamond. Subplots include underground boxing, gypsies who you can't understand but look like Brad Pitt, and a dog that swallows a squeaky toy.Even though I had no idea what was happening, who all of the characters were, what they were doing, and everything, I still really enjoyed Snatch. Why, I don't know, I just had a really good time trying to figure out what was happening on screen. Statham is a really good actor, not like Vin Diesel, who may be a good action star but can't act his way out of a paper bag (note to self: avoid clich√É¬©s like the plague). All of the other characters just kind of `go along with the flow,' but I wish I did learn more about how everyone was connected. Other than that, Snatch. is a high-octane and extremely enjoyable heist movie that may not be the best ever, but is still really good.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong violence, language, and some nudity.",8,2,5,12 June 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Strangelove: 7/10
","The title character in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is in less scenes than the number of words in the title, yet he is still an eerie presence. General Jack D. Ripper (Jack the Ripper¬Öget it) goes mad and orders us to bomb Russia in the height of the Cold War. Everyone in the American government tries to stop it.Peter Sellers has a tri-role: as Capt. Mandrake, assistant to Ripper, President Merkin Muffley, the slightly slow President of the USA, and Dr. Strangelove, an eccentric German doctor in the War Room. George C. Scott is Buck Turgidson, who is a crazed `Ruskie'-hater. Is there anyone in this movie who isn't crazy?All along the way of this seemingly short movie, I was reminded of MASH. They're both classic black comedies that I feel are overrated and I enjoy immensely but I don't find that funny. I thought Sellers was excellent in all three of his parts. I had forgotten that he was also the President. He's hilarious as Strangelove. I felt like that the characters weren't as developed as much as they could be, though. I also wish that there were more shots of inside of the bombers, since I thought they were quite funny, especially with Slim Pickens at the helm.Movies like this I love to sit through, but I always pine for more laughs. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie; in fact, it's genius at the director's chart-Stanley Kubrick. This marks the third one of his I've seen, after 2001 and The Shining. And, alas, I am sad that he has passed, and I also am sad that this review is shorter than his list of movies he directed.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for language and war.",10,0,1,27 March 2003
MASH," MASH: 7/10
","Please note: I saw this movie in pieces, so my review might have been different if I saw it all in one piece.
M*A*S*H is one of the most popular/successful T.V. shows of all time. And most people know that there was a T.V. show, but, surprisingly enough, not as many have heard about the movie.Directed by Robert 'Gosford Park' Altman, it begins with all the characters coming to the 4077th (I think) MASH unit (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) during the Korean War. Some characters include Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland), Trapper John (Elliot Gould), Duke (Tom Skerritt), and the foxy Hot Lips (Sally Kellerman). There really isn't a plot here, except for those zany escapades that the soldieres endure.First things first, I'm not a big fan of ensamble comedies (or ensamble movies in general). Gosford Park was a disaster (in my opinion). The characters are usually too hard to keep track of. However, MASH gives us time to get used to the characters and get to know them a little. It goes by rather speedily, which is thankful. I don't think I (or anyone) could have endured a 150 minute comma (comedy-drama) about the Korean war. Which brings me to my next point.Despite it being very entertaining, it didn't make me laugh that much. A few chuckles, some snorts, but nothing very sustaining. The lead players seemed to believe that they were the characters, and so did I. If I was drafted, I would have liked to work with these fine people; they would make the time fly by.On the other hand, Hot Lips was somewhat of a problem. She was opposed to football, but then she was a cheerleader in the climatic game? Doesn't seem right. The football game seemed to be filler; what was so important about winning (besides satisfaction and $5,000). Well, it does seem important, but they got too excited, it seemed.All in all, it's a very fun two hours. Unfourtunately, it's more fun than funny.My rating: 7/10Rated R for some sexual content.",7,11,22,13 October 2002
Alien," Alien: 4/10
","I've said this over and over, that I hate not liking classic movies. It's the whole ego thing, like I can't appreciate a good, classic movie, which isn't true. It's just that a good amount of classic movies aren't as good as they're hyped up to be. I feel that way for such movies as Halloween, The Meaning of Life, and other movies like that. Added to that list will be Alien. It's a slow, dreary, dark sci-fi saga that leads nowhere, and with just slightly better character development than most other horror movies, it's certainly nothing special, and completely undeserving of its classic status.In the future, the space ship Nostromo, headed back to Earth, picks up a distress signal. The crew interprets it as an SOS and goes to investigate it. Besides Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, some other B-list actors here are Tom Skerritt (Dallas), Harry Dean Stanton (Brett), and Ian Holm (Ash). It turns out that an alien attaches itself to one of the crew members, therefore putting all of them in jeopardy.I'm fine with Alien not really being an action movie, as I had expected. I just didn't expect it to be so doggone slow. Whenever something happens, it's played so subduedly (and without music, it seemed) that it almost seemed like nothing has happened. Often, when I'm watching a movie, if I start to get bored, I put the subtitles on so I have something else to do, also, taking away some of the boredom. They were on within about 10 minutes of starting it. And although I'm glad that we actually got to learn some of the characters' names, nothing really happened with them, they all sounded the same, etc., and that final twist with Ash was just plain stupid. It was unexpected, sure, but completely absurd and uncalled for. The sets were nice to look at, but did we really need to see them for two hours? There's more that could happen. The only worthwhile things in the whole movie were the alien itself and the infamous chestbursting scene.The ending scene also came out of nowhere, making the movie go on for even longer than it should have. I mean, come on, why? We've endured 105 minutes of this, why add 10 more on? I can see how Weaver could be made a star from this movie, although she wasn't very good. In fact, none were. But what else can be expected from the vastly overrated Alien, a boring, slow sci-fi movie whose only qualities are its sparse special effects and its tagline?My rating: 4/10Rated R for sci-fi violence/gore and language.",Null,2,10,15 September 2004
The Polar Express," The Polar Express: 8/10
","I don't understand why studios (especially WB) continue to spend massive amounts of money on certain movies. I would think that from Troy (which cost over $200 million to make, got about $150 million domestically and somehow recouped its losses overseas), they would know better than to invest a whole lot of money into one particular movie. But the lesson was not learned for The Polar Express. Using motion-capture animation (how they did Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies-or, even simpler, the animation Homer Simpsons invests a lot of money in), Robert Zemeckis (who last revolutionized animation with Who Framed Roger Rabbit) creates a dazzling world from Unnamed Suburbia to the North Pole. After hearing what the 3-D IMAX experience was like, I would have liked to have seen it there, but I saw it on a measly movie theater screen. Still, I loved it nonetheless.Tom Hanks, being the versatile man he is, does the voice and motion capture for about five characters: the boy (whose voice is mixed with Daryl Sabara's, from Spy Kids), the conductor, the hobo, the father, and Santa Claus. The boy, doubtful about Santa's existence, hears the whistle of a train right by his house on Christmas Eve. He steps aboard to see a bunch of other kids en route to the North Pole via The Polar Express. Along the way, magical things occur as the boy (trying to believe in Santa all the way) figures out the truth (secular truth, that is) behind Christmas.Surprisingly, being the cynic that I am, I loved The Polar Express. I think it was the simplicity-the book by Chris Van Allsburg is simple, and, although the movie is made out to feature length, it too is simple. The story's easy to follow, and that lets you get caught up in the visuals, which are astounding. All of the animation is astounding-not only is it lifelike, but it's also surreal. Some sequences (such as the 'lost ticket' sequence) are so, for lack of a better word, gratifying. I'm not sure if it's only me, but when I was watching The Polar Express, I felt like this was almost the culmination of animation. It seemed like we worked for 100 years to get up to the quality of The Polar Express. While that obviously isn't so, it sure seemed like it, which is quite a plus for the movie. For a movie to make me believe that this is the best quality possible is pretty spectacular.What's even more spectacular is that the movie made an old Scrooge like myself into some little kid mystified by the Christmas spirit. Sure, it's a month too early, but still.... The ability to take most people from nine-to-fivers to five-year-olds gawking at the idea of Santa is probably the most stunning transformation a movie can do to the audience. And The Polar Express does it perfectly. It's more than the 'another year, another advance in animation' movie. It's a huge achievement in film, and I speak that with no hyperbole. Not only is it the animators, but also Robert Zemeckis who make the movie what it is. Imagine the long hours that Zemeckis, basically overseeing the whole project, would have to work. I'm not trying to demean the animators here, as this was obviously a huge group effort, but if Peter Jackson can win a best director Oscar for making a nine hour movie, can't Zemeckis win one for making a movie of this magnitude?Unfortunately, having Hanks play four and a half characters means that four and a half characters sound exactly alike. It kind of takes away from the whole feel of the movie, when Santa, the conductor, his father, et al. sound exactly the same. Also, I think some of the situations were a bit childish (like the back-and-forth with the engineer, etc.), but still, that can't really diminish the awesome power the movie has. It's truly an amazing feat for everyone involved, and the fact that it probably won't get its money back is basically a sin.My rating: 8/10Rated G.",8,2,4,27 November 2004
Closer," Closer: 8/10
","From September to the end of the year, Jude Law will have been in six movies-I ? Huckabees, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Alfie, A Series of Unfortunate Events, The Aviator, and Closer. I'm sure most people are sick of him, but I think he's a good actor, and I like seeing him take on different types of roles. Certainly, Closer is a different type of role, and Law gets to use his natural British tongue here. Law also has some great support here: Natalie Portman (coming off of her role in Garden State), Clive Owen (now becoming more mainstream thanks to...King Arthur?), and Julia Roberts (who'd think she'd be GOOD in something?). And when you're being directed by Mike Nichols, how bad can you really be?Alice (Portman) is hit by a car and is taken to the hospital by Dan (Law). They fall in love. Dan has his picture taken by Anna (Roberts) and falls in love with her. He plays a trick on Larry (Owen) by pretending to be Anna online. Anna and Larry meet. They fall in love. Things continually get switched around like that.Closer is based on a play by Patrick Marber. There can't be more than 10 scenes, most of the story is relied on by dialogue, and there's a scarce number of characters. Now, I'm not sure if it's that fact or not, but it seemed like Mike Nichols did an outstanding job directing. This could just be me and my quirky film tastes, but I loved how there was absolutely no sense of time. You saw two people together for ten minutes, then a new scene, where something obviously must have happened, but what? That's where the dialogue comes in. That's how we find out what has happened in the time lapses. It's Nichols not condescending to the audience. He's trusting us enough to put together the pieces for the movie. In a way, this movie reminded me a lot of Godard's Contempt, in that scenes lasted for a long time. In Contempt about 45 minutes of the middle of the movie is one scene in a house, with two people talking. Closer obviously was influenced by that movie, and that's a good thing.All four of the lead actors (in fact, basically the only four actors) are amazing-more than I thought possible for any of them. Roberts (known in the film community as 'that person who stole Ellen Burstyn's Oscar in 2000') does a surprisingly good job-she seems to not have any ego here (now THAT is surprising), and that allows her to put in a realistic performance as one of those pretentious art-gallery types. Owen, who had been Dan in the original stage production, seemed to know what do to the most, and for that, was probably the best out of the four, closely rivaled by Portman. Shedding her goody-goody roles of the past, she plays a stripper who becomes entangled with everyone else. Garden State proved her acting talents, and Closer confirmed them. Law also proved that his six-films-a-year style doesn't faze him at all-he deserves all six, if not more.One thing I didn't like about Closer is the fact that it seemed to be rather long (reminded me of both Contempt and Solaris). It's less than 100 minutes, but seemed longer. However, the simple (yet complex) story is sustained for that runtime, making Closer a great, challenging film to watch-there's some explicitness in it that wasn't necessary, but if you can get through that, I think Closer will offer a complex night at the movies.My rating: 8/10Rated R for sequences of graphic sexual dialogue, nudity/sexuality and language.",8,2,5,5 December 2004
Lost in Translation," Lost in Translation: 10/10
","Scarlett Johansson is like a car. She can go from 17 to 25 in two years. In Ghost World, she effectively played a senior in high school. Here, in Lost in Translation, two years after Ghost World was released, she plays a woman who has been married for two years. Johansson plays that role like it was even more natural. As she has said before, she doesn't take every role that she can; she doesn't want to become Shannon Elizabeth or anyone like that. After her role here, we can expect her to become one of the more larger stars of now.Charlotte (Johansson) is in Tokyo with her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi), who is a photographer who barely has time for her. He wouldn't have noticed even if she hadn't gone along with him to Japan. She is staying in the same hotel as Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a once-big movie star who is in Tokyo for a $2 million photo shoot for an ad for whiskey. Both suffering for jet lag and different stages of crises (Bob in midlife; Charlotte, quarterlife), they take to each other and become friends in their search for meaning in life.It's refreshing to see a movie that transcends the Woody Allen style of older man/younger woman relationships. Instead of the girl falling for the guy, they just become great friends, which is a whole lot more realistic. What helps with that relationship is obvious: the tenderness of the acting of both Murray and Johansson. They don't portray people just looking for a one-night stand, they need someone stable for their relationship. Writer/director Sofia Coppola really knows what she wants, and gives it to Murray and Johansson, who run with it and really make it work.What surprised me is how one scene could be so dramatic and sorrowful, and then jumping to a hilarious scene somewhere else. Often times, it doesn't work, but Coppola decided to take a risk. That was one risk that was worth taking. Murray is his usual deadpan self, but with a better grasp that this is a drama with comedic overtones, not the other way around as his other movies are. He stands out as the leading man, and he's what holds this movie together. Johansson, in my opinion, had the easier role. Her emotions were easier to convey and were more `out there'. She still excelled, though.It's movies like this that are hard to write reviews for. Instead of reading this review, why aren't you out there seeing Lost in Translation?My rating: 10/10Rated R for some sexual content.",10,0,0,28 September 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Full Metal Jacket: 10/10
","Full Metal Jacket is the fourth Stanley Kubrick movie I have seen (the others are 2001, The Shining, and Dr. Strangelove). This is my second favorite out of those four.It's basically a two-part story. The first part is clearly the better part, and is one of the best acts in a movie I have ever seen. It has a drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey) sadistically dehumanizing recruits into the Marines for the Vietnam War. This is one of the basics of Kubrick movies, the dehumanization of humans. It is most clearly seen in The Shining, also. Among some of the new Marines are Joker (Matthew Modine), Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Cowboy (Arliss Howard). Gomer is fat, so the drill instructor likes to pick on him. The second part has them actually going into the war.It's really hard to put the first part into words. Ermey spitfires insults and hateful things for about ten minutes straight, without taking a breath or anything. He was a drill instructor before becoming an actor, and it shows. He was outstanding, just truly outstanding. He was screwed from winning Best Supporting Actor for his role. Just like the narration of Fight Club, it's hard to put how I feel into words.Something I didn't expect was that it had bits and pieces of humor that were in it. Most of it, yet again, came from Ermey as he was yelling at the recruits. I laughed a lot, even though they weren't that appropriate. The laughs, obviously, tapered off in the second part. Much of the humor wasn't P.C., either, but this was 15 years ago.Only a genius could put humor into a time of turmoil. Thank you, Mr. Kubrick.Overall, I have two complaints about the films. First, the editing was poor. Second, the second act could obviously not compare to the first one. Although the second part was good, maybe a 7/10, the first part was over a 10/10, so I took around an average. The second part, however, was very realistic and made me feel like I was in the Vietnam War.Ermey was terrific, as I said before, but Modine proved himself to be a good leading actor. Although he hasn't done much recently, he could come back as a good actor. I really liked the music in Full Metal Jacket, sometimes it was cheerful, especially in the beginning, when the recruits were getting their heads shaved. The narration was rather odd, coming and going.The violence isn't gratuitous, but there is a lot of it. It looked realistic, which is good. It's better to have realistic violence and blood than fake. Instead of sugarcoating the violence to a PG-13 level, they showed everything, graphic but not over the top. Unfortunately, all of the deaths were in slow motion, but that didn't stop me from looking at it and gasping in awe. Kubrick makes another bravura masterpiece here.My rating: 10/10Rated R for strong language and violence, and sexual refrences.",10,1,2,7 May 2003
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump: 9/10
","Winner of six Academy Awards, Forrest Gump is still a very popular film today, despite being out for nine years.Tom Hanks plays the title character who is sitting on a bench, waiting for the number 9 bus. He's relaying his life story to the people also waiting for a bus. His story goes like this:As a young boy in a fatherless household, Forrest never got out much. He had to wear leg braces and only found one friend-Jenny. `They's was like peas and carrots.' But, they have to go their separate ways, but always wind up meeting each other again. Forrest goes to the Vietnam War, is a ping-pong champion, and is a fishing boat captain while Jenny becomes a hippie scrounging for cash, etc. The life story is fascinating.I've always like narration, but sometimes heavy narration can become tedious. In some cases, the overwhelming use of narration reminded me of Fight Club, even though the two films couldn't be more different. During the end of the film, when Forrest gets to where he was going, the narration, obviously, wasn't there (since Forrest wasn't explaining it to anyone). I missed it. I thought that the narration was the best part of the film.The authenticity of the historic events that Forrest got himself into was genuine. Not being alive for those parts, I couldn't really relate to them, but I could relate to Forrest. He had a certain charm to him that made you root for him as soon as he put the feather in Curious George. Jenny was also crafted so you could like her and feel sorry for her during her times of despair.Sally Field plays Forrest's mother, Mrs. Gump, who just is a book of wisdom. With pithy quotes such as `Stupid is as stupid does' and `Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get', it's no wonder why Forrest is able to get to all of the historical time periods.Hanks was superb as Gump. His southern drawl seemed authentic and his na√É¬Øve character, he was able to bring out 100%, without me thinking for a moment that this was someone other than Forrest Gump himself. I thought that Robin Wright, who plays Jenny, was also exceptional and brought out all that was needed for her complex character. Field had a small role but also brought out her best and made me believe that she was Mrs. Gump, not Sally Field.Gary Sinise plays Lieutenant Dan, Forrest's lieutenant from Vietnam. He lost both of his legs, but soon meets Forrest again and go on `crazy schmes', so to speak. His loss of legs was made by wrapping a blue thing around his lower legs, which allowed them to be digitally removed.Forrest Gump is a touching, moving, gripping, and sometimes funny journey through the eyes of someone with an I.Q. of 75. You'll never be the same when you view the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump.My rating: 9/10Rated PG-13 for strong language, sensuality, war violence, and drug content.",9,0,3,4 January 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget Jones's Diary: 6/10
","If there's anything I hate more than overrated movies, it's overhyped movies that don't even begin to live up to their reputation. Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the latter. With an original premise (which is of course taken from a book), a rising star, and charm out the wazoo, how could you go wrong? It's all in the marketing. A clever comedy has to have two things. A consistent clever quality to it and comedy. When lacking in either of these two categories, the company (usually Miramax) just overhypes it (as they're great at doing) so it'll be like the next Gone with the Wind or something and make sure that everyone knows that the lead actress packed on a couple extra pounds. And, unfortunately, that's what this movie is.The title character (Ren√©e Zellweger) is a slightly overweight, slight neurotic thirtysomething who has a menial job and wants to make something out of her life. So she starts a diary and becomes romanticly involved with her boss. Without the diary, the movie would just be another British chick flick. The diary adds some characteristic to the movie, but, as most movies do, anything interesting they could do with the material is defenestrated for general romantic comed clich√©s and stereotyped characters.Why am I being so harsh on it, you may ask? Well, I had been hearing the hype for two years, since the movie first came out. 'Oh, Ren√©e is so good, she gained 25 pounds!' 'The movie is hilarious!' Oftentimes I can just put away the hype and go in with an open mind. But I did not see this before hearing about it; if I had, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more. For example, I saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding before it was huge and grossed over $200 million at the box office. I enjoyed it a lot, but if I watched it for the first time now, I'm sure I'd be thinking exactly what I am about this movie here. I was led to believe that this movie was strikingly original, nothing else had been done before that was even remotely close to it. As I have mentioned earlier, the only original part of it was the fact that the diary was getting us closer to Bridget's life. But after the first twenty minutes or so, when they knew they had us in, they took it out and went to clich√© land.There were some funny moments to it, though. Nothing was down-and-out hilarious, but many points were pretty humorous, although I wouldn't be able to name them now. It's not one of those movies that sticks with you, it's just one of those that you can use to pass the time and that can be used by production companies for unnecessary sequels.Ren√©e (who starred in here before she became America's it-girl) was pretty good and mastered a British accent masterfully, and proves that she's worthy of a future in romantic comedy. Hugh Grant, as Bridget's boss, is his usual self, and Colin Firth, as Bridget's other love interest, is alright, but that added a few plot holes, such as: if Bridget could never get a guy all of her life, how come suddenly she gets two at the same time, not to mention they look like Hugh Grant and Colin Firth? I guess I'm overreacting, but when I see something that's not what it's cracked up to me, I get upset, which is how Bridget Jones's Diary made me feel.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language and some strong sexuality.",6,1,2,31 January 2004
Predator," Predator: 5/10
","I suppose that all of these 'versus' movies have some redeeming qualities to them. They make the average moviegoer go and see the original movies. Before Freddy vs. Jason came out, I rented Friday the 13. And for Alien vs. Predator, I rented both of those movies. Alien's DVD was broken, so I watched Predator instead. Expecting a pretty good action/sci-fi along the lines of The Terminator, I was excited to watch this movie, hoping-nay, knowing-that it would be better than Alien vs. Predator. Was I right? Sure, but not by much.Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his commandos are sent to a jungle in Central America to rescue others, discover that there's worse things at work there instead of random bad guys the army has to kill. It turns out that the title thing, who can become invisible at will, is stalking and killing all of them. Guess who's the last one alive who has to kill it?The first 45 minutes of this film have nothing to do with the title being. Instead, it's this search-and-rescue mission that doesn't affect the outcome of the movie at all. Dutch and co. have to go in and kill a bunch of random people, the nationality doesn't matter, as long as they're not American. I suppose that's tolerable as long as the last hour is filled with thrills, gore, and fun. But considering what I just said, the last hour didn't have those things. Instead, what we have are a few, misplaced one-liners, a little generic action, followed by a lot of sitting around and talking. It's not even violent, it mainly consists of the cut-away kills that people don't like about the PG-13 action films. But when the people sit and talk, the dialogue isn't even interesting, it's a bunch of cursing and 'Where's [name]?' Does anyone really care?Not being alive in 1987, I can only assume that the special effects must have been spectacular for the time. Now, they look generic. The costume of the Predator's alright, but nothing to write home about. Definitely the best part of the movie are the POV shots taken from the Predator. He obviously sees in heat, and even I was amazed by those effects. They also play the continuity with that well, while every other possible continuity error occurs throughout the film. For instance, at one shot, Dutch is completely covered in mud. The next? Clean. To sum things all up, Predator is a sloppily made action movie that's made superior from its 'versus' movie because of the view of the Predator. Save your time and money by looking online for some screenshots from the movie. You'll thank me.My rating: 5/10Rated R for language and some violence.",5,0,11,19 August 2004
The Aviator," The Aviator: 7/10
","I can't really talk about Martin Scorsese's directorial credentials, as I've only seen three of his movies: Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and The Aviator. All of them have the same rating-why is that? Maybe it's Scorsese's inability to keep those movies under two hours (The Aviator clocks in at about three with previews), or since those three movies dealt on real people, did Scorsese and his screenwriters get their life stories wrong? Whatever the case is, they're all good, but maybe I'm just not able to appreciate everything Scorsese does. It's been two years since Leonardo DiCaprio's last role in Catch Me If You Can. He's not what everyone made him out to be after Titanic; he's no longer just an idol of teenage girls. Instead, he's proved himself to be a fine actor, one that's perfect to play Howard Hughes.In the beginning of the movie, Howard Hughes (DiCaprio) is working on directing a huge epic movie. We have no backstory to him, which may have caused trouble later on. There's no telling of how he got his massive fortune, but I digress. He works for three or four years on his picture Hell's Angels, making it the most expensive movie at that time. The movie follows Hughes through his his tumultuous movie career, pioneering aviation career (such as buying TWA), his relationships with Katharing Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale), and his insanity (spoofed brilliantly on The Simpsons, I might add). You'll also see Jude Law as Errol Flynn (in his sixth, and final, role of late 2004).For its almost-three-hour runtime, The Aviator seemed to go by rather quickly. We have the great Howard Shore score, which is sometime mixed with music from the era, to create an odd-but interesting-effect. Scorsese's direction is great in some parts, but not in others. In the crash sequence, Scorsese finds ways to build up the tension (although the interior of the houses we see look quite late-1990s...), even though we know there's still at least an hour to go in the movie, yet when it comes to the tail end of the movie, when we see Hughes in all of his insane glory, we don't really see how he progressed from a mid-case OCDer to this completely delusional psycho. It's a complete transition. Although we do get a sense that Hughes is becoming more mentally unstable, it's just completely from left-field, and maybe instead of 15 minutes of showing how different he is from the Hepburn family, Scorsese could have showed what pushed him over the edge or something like that.The movie looked pretty good. The cinematography was pretty good; it's probably the one Oscar that this movie is a shoo-in for. There's DiCaprio's acting, which'll be nominated, but won't win (obviously, Jamie Foxx for Ray). DiCaprio obviously studied Hughes and his mannerisms, and does a good job pulling him off, but can anyone compare him to what Hughes was really like? Acting out someone who no one remembers (personally) is kind of a cop-out for not having to do a top-notch acting job (see, Foxx didn't have it that easy for Ray Charles). Yet he still did a good job, and threw off any lingering 'King of the World' thoughts that people had about him. Blanchett is quickly rising on my favorite actress list-this and The Life Aquatic back to back, great in both. There's John C. Reilly, who's a good actor, but whose voice is so damn recognizable it's hard to consider him a powerhouse actor. And Alec Baldwin. Remember when, in South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, the Baldwins' house, and everyone was happy? They were happy because Alec Baldwin couldn't play a character named JUAN! That's like Johnny Depp playing Fat Albert. It just doesn't work.The Aviator is an entertaining movie. Sure, it drags for a bit, and is unnecessarily long, but it's never boring. It's by no means the year's best biopic (that goes to Ray), but it's an entertaining one.My rating: 7/10 Rated PG-13 for thematic elements, sexual content, nudity, language and a crash sequence.",7,7,13,1 January 2005
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity: 7/10
","Spy thrillers can be either good or bad. When they're just mass produced (see also: The Recruit), they becoming boring, no matter how hard they try. The Bourne Identity is certainly not the elite in spy movies, that's a fact, but it at least seems more sophisticated than others. Loosely (thankfully) based on Robert Ludlum's ridiculously absurd novel, it's what you'd expect from a summer action movie, but it has a little more into it. Not enough to make it a classic, but enough to make it worth your two hours.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) washes ashore with no memory of who he was or how he got there. He realizes that he was a spy for the CIA, but now for some reason the American government is trying to hunt him down. He teams up with Marie (Franka Potente) and tries to figure out who he is, why he's running, and how to defeat his pursuers.Ludlum's novel was too long, too confusing, had too many characters, and was just plain silly. Thank God the American public is stupid, so the book would be dumbed down for the movie version. There's little development on any character except Bourne (especially not on anyone in the CIA-was that Julia Stiles?), the plot could use some working on, and at times it seemed a little hard to believe. But there's action to spare, and it's all pretty exciting. Damon isn't really the make of an action hero, which works with his character, since he's just supposed to blend in. I just hope this doesn't go to his head and he starts thinking he should be the next Arnie.The obligatory car chase scene was pretty cool, although there was much product placement (BMW and Minis). It's all pretty standard, but it's not subpar. The rest of the action scenes were pretty intense and exciting, with the screen being used to its full potential. On that note, let me give kudos to director Doug Liman. His choice of shots worked very well, and it was obvious to see what he was trying to achieve in each shot. Why he didn't sign on to direct the sequel, I don't know. But The Bourne Identity is good enough in its own right-what people want out of an action movie, plus the addition of a pretty good character, Jason Bourne.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.",7,0,1,26 July 2004
The Italian Job," The Italian Job: 7/10
","Move over, Sharon Stone! Somebody who was once at the top of their game is now reduced to this. Yes, I'm talking to you, Charlize Theron. Of course, it isn't as bad as an amorous night with the little AOL man, but when you're second billed to MARK WAHLBERG, your career's in hock. Although when other actors such as Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and Jason Statham, you can look and see that it's not all bad.What I'm talking about it The Italian Job, F. Gary Gray's addition to the ever-popular genre of heist movies. In fact, Gray is a big fan of these type of movies, naming Snatch the greatest heist flick ever. Unlike straight heist films like Heist, The Italian Job has humor and takes itself more humorously. Of course we don't understand everything that the computer whiz/geek Lyle says, but neither do the people in the movie, adding to the mocking tone of the movie. It's not exactly a parody of crime movies, just an homage.Donald Sutherland must have been aching for a paycheck. He stars as John Bridger, an aging thief who is doing.guess.one last job! Clich√®s run high, but so does fun (I'll get to that later). He's with his team doing a job in Italy, and they successfully steal about $35 million. One of the team, Steve (Edward Norton) turns against them, shoots and kills John, and runs off with the gold. The rest of the crew plan to steal the gold from Steve because of revenge, including Stella, John's daughter.PT Cruisers used to be the fad car, but now Mini Coopers are becoming steadily more popular. Thanks to The Italian Job, where everyone drives one, that is. The car chases weren't that many, but the culminating one was great. When three Minis were driving on the subway tracks, it was just amazing, I really loved it. Of course, there was a lot of advertising. It's basically a two-hour car commercial, with a few Pepsi adds added in.However, there's an interesting note I found. Wahlberg, who plays Charlie, the ringleader, said that The Italian Job had some of the most amazing special effects he had ever seen, while Norton repeated several times that he joined this movie only because of contractual agreements. Wahlberg is most definitely not a leading man.his acting's like a log on a stream. It starts off high but then falls down. Theron, who plays a beautiful safecracker, also isn't that great of an actress. When the high point of your career is a RECENT Woody Allen film, you're in trouble. Norton, my second favorite actor, heaps on the camp, but still doesn't come off that well. Other actors, including Mos Def, Stathem, and Green, were all funny, especially Green.The Italian Job is very fun and entertaining, but can't stay away from clich√©s. Sutherland does one last move, Norton has a moustache, Green is geeky, Theron is beautiful, there's a token African-American. Also, the ending is more predictable than, well, a Disney movie. Overall, The Italian Job is a fun two hours. If you're looking for more than that, stay away.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.",7,0,1,7 June 2003
Lilo & Stitch," Lilo and Stitch: 4/10
","I don't really like the company of Disney, but sometimes they make movies that surprise me with their quality (Monsters, Inc., The Lion King). Their animated films can be quite good. Note the word `can'.Lilo, voiced by Daveigh Chase (The Ring), is a five-year-old Hawaiian girl who is being raised by her older sister Nani, voiced by Tia Carrere. Lilo and Nani's parents died.Meanwhile, in space, project 626 (voice of Chris Sanders) was made to be a vicious killing machine thing. When it escapes, it falls to Earth, while two bumbling aliens try to get it. 626 is found by Lilo and is named Stitch (hence the name Lilo and Stitch). The movie is about their so-called `adventures'.First off, Lilo and Stitch tries to hard. It tries too hard to be funny, to appeal to all age brackets, and to bring back the appeal of the early 90s, when such movies like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King were deemed best of the best. Sure I laughed a few times, but not enough. Its rather gross humor at times (Stitch licking the inside of his nose, getting apparatus from the nose and eating it) didn't appeal to me at all. Adults would find that revolting, though kids would crack up. Why did they use lavish watercolors instead of CGI? Maybe so they can go up to Dreamworks and say `WE don't need computers to make a movie!' Lilo and Stitch would have worked better as a computer generated movie for some reason. It just seemed out of place to use blue-collar work.Ving Rhames comes in (!) as a social worker named Cobra Bubbles (generating one of the few laughs I protruded) and wants to take Lilo away from Nani. Gasp! O no! We really know them so well to care!And that is where my second point comes in. It seems to abandon many plot elements along the way. Lilo runs into a hula dance lesson, but is never seen dancing again. Why aren't we told more about the parents (or would that be too harsh for the young ones who really pay attention to every word said)? David (Jason Scott Lee), a young man, seems to come and go and is introduced without any knowledge. Why is he here and why aren't we told about him at all?Also, they tried to `dumb it down' a little. Why should we hate a man doing his job (Mr. Bubbles)? We obviously see that Nani is not being a very good parent, so why should we care that they are going to be separated? It's for the best. Too much slapstick even for me. Wow-kids fall. Hahaha. What was the purpose of putting songs from Elvis in? Could it be that it's a musical but those smart folks at Disney couldn't think of any songs to put in? Well, duh!You may think I totally hate it now, but it is watchable and, as I said before, a little funny. Its whole space theme, I just didn't think should have been put in there. It seemed to not fit along with the remote Hawaiian island theme (but fish-out-of-water, I guess). Lilo and Stitch is harmless kid's fare, but avoid if possible if you have half a usable mind.My rating: 4/10Rated PG for mild sci-fi action.",4,2,11,24 December 2002
The Village," The Village: 6/10
","The most effective way to get a demographic to a movie where they wouldn't normally go is by misleading trailers. If the trailers for The Hulk depicted it to be an outstanding drama, like it was, I would doubt it would get its money back. The same goes for The Village. M. Night Shyamalan, known for his what-you-don't-see-scares-you type of movies (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), now has done The Village, which, according to the ads, is a scare-fest around 1900. In reality, it's a period piece about some haunted woods. The movie chronicles their interactions with each other, for the most part.In a small village surrounded by woods, the people of Covington live in constant fear of the creatures that live in the woods around. They have struck up a shaky deal with them-neither of them enter the other's territory. Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) is blind and is in mutual love with taciturn Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix). Since it seems that simple-minded Noah (Adrien Brody) can enter the woods without being harmed, Lucius tries it and ends up disturbing the balance between the two life forms. Soon Lucius is put out of commission and Ivy has to walk through the woods to get medicine. You know, even though it's 1900, I would think that people would have more sense than to have a blind person go through haunted woods by themselves.Shyamalan knows how to create fear, and for a few fleeting seconds, he does in The Village. The failing point is that there's barely any moments in which that could happen. Most of the movie is spent on the characters and unnecessary subplots that have no purpose. Shyamalan knows the what-you-don't-see-scares-you way of going about it, but with another overbearing score, James Newton Howard takes the what-you-hear-scares-you way of going about it, and winds up being almost farcical, which is what the movie becomes at times. Seeing the creatures is one of the funniest moments in a movie this year. I mean...come on! Still, when it is scary, it's pretty damn intense. But for one minute out of a 108 minute movie, it's not a good ratio.Shyamalan is known for his twists at the end of movies. The Sixth Sense had one that was truly shocking; Unbreakable's was also mind-blowing but one I'd need to see again, but Signs' was just plain silly. Many people feel that in both Signs and The Village he's writing a script so he can have a twist at the end. The twist is what basically saved this movie. It's a shocking twist, one that I didn't get, and most people didn't, also, even though they say they did. It's much better than the stupidity of Signs' ending. That's where the first hour and a half comes in. It's basically fluff, with unnecessary subplots thrown in (including the love twist with Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt) and a bunch of random characters. Also, with the slow build-up of the creatures, instead of a slow pay-off of slowly revealing the monsters, they come out all at once. And as I said before, I cracked up when I saw them.The acting here isn't as good as Shyamalan's others. Phoenix (who seems to have taken over the wheel from Bruce Willis) isn't as good as he was in Signs, surprisingly. Howard isn't worthy of all of this praise, but she was still good. Weaver doesn't have much to do, but Hurt totally owns the screen whenever he's on. If you're looking for a reason to see this movie, see it for William Hurt. I'll probably be killed for this, but I think Brody was better here than in The Pianist. He seems to be having fun here. If you go into The Village looking for a fun time, you probably won't find it. You may come out of it with more than I did, but it has its moments, especially at the end.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for a scene of violence and frightening situations.",6,0,0,9 August 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines
","Now THIS is what summer movies are all about! Instead of having PG-13 action, it goes all out with its $170 million budget and having some realistic blood, while keeping it reasonable and believable. It's basically 105 minutes of wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am with a small story thrown in, but it's basically a recycled plot with a new character, a newer robot, and great special effects! Although they went all out¬Öand I mean all out¬Öit looked really good! It's not some cheesy Universal blockbuster that just throws bad FX wherever, the ones in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines looked real, and I only hope that Arnold's stuntperson was paid well.Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in kick-butt form as the T-800 Terminator. Not only does he rehash his catch phrases, he is able to bring back the fun in action movies that has been missing the last twelve years. It's a really fun time. As I've said before, Arnold's not a great actor, but when he's an action star instead of trying to act, he's really fun to watch. He seemed really game to do this movie.The plot is nothing special. Arnold comes back from the future to protect not only John Connor (Nick Stahl) this time, but also feisty Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), because she'll be a general against the machines in the upcoming war. However, a T-X (Kristanna Loken), the most advanced Terminator cyborg from the future, comes to destroy all of the former classmates of John, because they'll join the resistance. As you can see, the plot's not as good as the first two.If you put your mind on hold, which I was willing to do for this, T3 is a very entertaining sequel. Although it won't win awards, it's better than most out there now.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong sci-fi violence and action, and for language and brief nudity.",Null,0,0,8 July 2003
"I, Robot"," I, Robot: 6/10
","Once upon a time, there was a Russian author who had incredible foresight into the world of modern technology. He decided to publish his thoughts into a book called I, Robot. Later on, Oscar winning writer Akiva Goldsman wrote a movie about a bunch of killer robots. He titled the movie I, Robot. Are there any similarities between the two pieces of writing? Besides the classic three rules of robotics and two characters having the same name, absolutely nothing. I knew it would be completely different, so I'll try to refrain from commenting on the differences between the two. It may be hard to do, but I'll do my best.Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is in the Chicago PD who doesn't like robots becoming helpers in society. One day, a robot called Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk, last seen in Dodgeball) supposedly commits a crime. No one believes that he did it except for Del, because robots follow the three laws: a robot must do anything to save humans, a robot must follow orders unless it would conflict with the first law, and a robot must save itself unless it would conflict with the firs two laws. Therefore, no one believes that Sonny could do it. But Del goes out and tries to prove them wrong, along with Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan).Movies like this can be simple action movies held together with a loose plot and a wise-cracking (but unfunny), buff action hero star who kicks ass whenever possible. That's all fine and dandy, except that that has become a clich√©. At least the Terminator couldn't really speak. All of Spooner's wisecracks were unfunny (I take that back-one was pretty good) and unnecessary. But not only was that character clich√©d, but so was most of the plot. There's a cold, genius female scientist whom the male action hero gets to open up. There's the one-dimensional bad guy (Bruce Greenwood) who's just thrown into a few scenes. But what else would you expect? It's a summer blockbuster.And much like other summer blockbusters, I, Robot is entertaining on a general scale. The futuristic set is pretty cool (although they drew themselves into a hole-that's not what Chicago will look like in 2035. I had the same problem with Minority Report), as they almost always are. The robots were also pretty cool, although, once again, it seemed too extreme for 30 years from now. Plus, it annoyed me that they all walked like cowboys. But that's a moot point. Although the editing was too quick, the action scenes were fun to watch. Sure, Smith's just fighting computer generated images, but that doesn't make it uncool to watch. In fact, they're some of the best action scenes of the year.Smith is on another train of losers when it comes to acting. I actually only liked him in Men in Black. He's just not that good, no matter what studios think. He doesn't really have drawing power anymore-I don't know anyone who is going to this movie for Smith. Everyone else is bland, as is expected, but movies like this usually don't go on character. They don't even go on plot, like the inanity of the ending can show. It goes on an entertaining time, and if that's all you walk into I, Robot expecting, you definitely won't be disappointed. If you go in expecting some low-key version of Asimov's collection of short stories, you'd better go see something else, because that this isn't.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for intense stylized action, and some brief partial nudity.",6,0,0,18 July 2004
American Beauty," American Beauty: 8/10
","Sam Mendes of Road to Perdition fame first directed American Beauty a haunting, sad, and funny life of suburbia gone wrong. Kevin Spacey, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his role, is Lester Burnham, a depressed 40's husband with a droll job in a magazine. He's constantly pushed around, especially by his successful real estate wife Carolyn (Annette Benning) and his rebellious teenage daughter Jane (Thora Birch). He decides to get noticed and not be the scab that everyone flicks at.First, he blackmails his boss; he does drugs, and others, to name some. Carolyn starts to see a rival real estate dealer (Peter Gallagher), Jane falls for a voyeuristic new neighbor Ricky (Wes Bentley), who is supplying Lester with his drugs. Lester also falls for Jane's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari), while his father, recent Oscar winner Chris Cooper, abuses Ricky. Although these stories do not seem to have anything in common, they flow together simply.As I was watching this movie, I was reminded of two movies: Far From Heaven and Ghost World. The former had an affluent family with one problem that leads to the next, while the latter, besides that they both star Thora Birch, have troubled high schoolers. I thought that the acting was capital. Spacey was an `all-singing-all-dancing crap of the world' who slowly turned himself into something greater. I thought that this transformation was simply amazing, and so was Spacey's acting. It was just outstanding. I really felt for him. Benning was also very good, but I understand why she didn't win an Oscar, and she cried too much.One thing I enjoyed about this film is that it accurately portrayed upper-middle class families. They have special sofas, luxury SUVs, and more. Although the people there only think materialistically, they have no idea that everything can turn to shambles. However, Jane realizes that her life isn't normal, and she doesn't do anything about it. Birch was great, too, but nowhere near as great as her performance in Ghost World. All of the others were great too. I especially liked Suvari's Angela, who thinks she is perfect and shuns her inner feelings. I also liked the `twist' that Ricky's father undergoes.Small aspects make or break a movie. Here, they make it. The music was simply outstanding, sometimes sad, sometimes happy and gleeful. Also, the cinematography was great. Billed as a dramedy, it succeeded in both parts, but not was much as it could have. I didn't laugh as much as I wished, and I wasn't as touched as I wanted to be. Other than that, I really loved taking this trip down the not-so-long-ago.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong sexuality, language, violence and drug content.",10,0,0,28 March 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator 2: Judgment Day: 8/10
","Arnold never lies. In The Terminator, he said he'd be back, and he's back in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, the sequel that is a little superior to the original, but not much. It boasts a little more action, a little more suspense, a better story, and better acting. In this edition, released seven years after the first one, but taking place ten years after, a new T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) comes to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong, in his debut), who will be the leader of the humans in a war against machines. However, a T-1000 cyborg (Robert Patrick) has also come from the future, but to kill John.The Terminator was a movie that actually needed a sequel. Maybe James Cameron just felt like leaving a cliffhanger, but I think that the first movie wouldn't have worked that well if a sequel wasn't existent. T2 went further into the story, and made the utterly unbelievable from the first one seem more likely to happen. Of course, it's hard to believe that five years ago, a nuclear war was to break out, but when have James Cameron films been believable?Arnold was given more lines in this film, and, although he isn't a great actor, he was very cool in this role. Of course, he has been typecast by now, but whenever he was destroying whatever and causing mayhem, it was great. He's the epitome of an action star. Furlong was pretty good in his debut, but the real standout is Linda Hamilton, John's mother. She had more of a chance to actually act, even though she wasn't the star, and she's a good actress.The special effects were greatly improved from the first film. Instead of having robots that would have Ray Harryhausen rolling in his grave, they're seamless. The T-1000s can shift shape, and, being a child of the `good special effects or none at all' era, I was very impressed. His healing powers were very cool, and anytime he was shot or hit, etc., his body bent and it was awesome to look at. I'm surprised that it was only seven years after robots than jauntily move. I hope to be this impressed when I see T3.Overall, I have to thank Cameron for bringing us a sequel that lives up to the series (how many Alien movies have there been now, James?) and doesn't lack on the thrills nor the special FX.My rating: 8/10Rated R for sci-fi violence and language.",8,0,0,6 July 2003
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now: 8/10
","I think filmmakers need to know that the Vietnam War is over and done with. Although most were made in the 70s and 80s, there's been way too many Vietnam War movies. What's worse is that almost all, if not all of them, are great movies. And what's worst of all is that almost all of them are forgettable. No one can deny the power that Platoon had, but can you really remember much about it six months after seeing it? One month? That's the trouble with war movies in general. It's been about a month since I've seen Apocalypse Now (I've been busy), and I don't remember much about it. Even while watching the movie, I thought to myself, 'Man, this movie is amazing, but it won't have any lasting effect.' That's exactly the case.Col. Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent by the military to eliminate Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) 'with extreme prejudice'. Supposedly Kurtz set himself up as a god among men in Cambodia, and Willard and Co. have to go and destroy him and his compound. Along the way comes Robert Duvall and a horde of random soldiers-the token black man (Laurence Fishburn) who has an odd nickname, the fish-out-of-water (Sam Bottoms), and more.Sure, Apocalypse Now is long (two and a half hours), and at times it drags-especially when it comes to Duvall's random character. Perhaps I just don't remember it that well (see my first paragraph), but he just popped up. However, Francis Ford Coppola's movie does create a feeling of isolation and desperation. That's what all war movies are supposed to do, but Apocalypse Now does it better than others. In fact, the effect that the movie had on me while watching was tremendous-easily as heart-pounding as the first part of Full Metal Jacket, and was mixed with the sadness of inevitably knowing that I wouldn't remember this. But the acting's good (but Marlon Brando, man-he must've been in for about ten minutes), and as you're watching it, you'll love it. If you remember it afterward, you'll continue to love it.My rating: 8/10Rated R for disturbing violent images, language, sexual content and some drug use.",8,1,4,11 December 2004
Van Helsing," Van Helsing: 4/10
","Van Helsing officially started off the 2004 summer movie season. By the looks of it, it's gonna be a crappy season. Van Helsing takes whatever of the audience's intelligence (but then again, since this is from the director of The Mummy, the audience doesn't have much), and throws it out of the window. Every other scene contradicts the other, and there are so many plot holes and unnecessary plot developments that it's hardly worth following. Now, before you chastise me for taking an action movie too seriously, let me go into the plot.Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is someone who fights evil for the current hot topic in films-a secret order of Catholic priests. He is sent to Transylvania to defeat Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), as that will save the whole Valerious family from Hell (long story). Once he gets there, he battles the brides of Dracula with the last remaining Valerious, Anna (Kate Beckinsale). Along with his nerdish sidekick Carl (David Wenham), they go to battle evil, along with all of Universal's other monsters, Frankenstein and The Wolf Man.There are two schools of thought for this movie. One is that it's an entertaining movie with intentionally bad CGI, a movie you should just sit back and enjoy. The other is that as much as you wanted to enjoy the movie, you couldn't because of the story. I am in the second. I enjoyed writer/director Stephen Sommers' Mummy movies, as I was able to suspend my belief, something I was not able to do for Van Helsing. The character of Van Helsing was, I believe, in the Dracula series, yet he was taken completely out of context as this monster-hunter. At least the movie makes sure that we know who the Universal characters are.To prove my point, here are some examples of how little this movie cares about entertaining our brains. A subtitle claims that Vatican City is in Rome. Although technically it is, the Vatican is a country, not 'part' of Rome. Latin writings used improper grammatical syntax. Vampires, which everyone knows can only come out at night, attack in the broad daylight. Full moons come a dime a dozen. Werewolf transformations, which supposedly cause the transformer the first time, flows seamlessly when someone becomes a werewolf. Vampires can travel quicker than Transylvanian horses, 'the fastest thing on Earth'. Whenever anything touches the ground, it blows up. Werewolf serum can only be given within the twelve strokes of midnight when the werewolf first transforms, and, by God, according to this movie, those are the longest twelve strokes ever. Raging monsters, such as Mr. Hyde, can control their actions. And no one, not even the physically fit Van Helsing, can swim down about one foot. And people say 'leave your brains at the door' for this one. Even if you do you'll still find faults.As for the action sequences, sure, they beat twiddling your thumbs, but that by no means means that they were exciting. It's like the culminating fight in The Two Towers: after a while, seeing random computer-generated freaks fighting each other becomes boring. Sometimes it flaunts itself, saying 'look what we can do!', but much better (and emotionally involving) transformations took place in The Hulk. And sometimes the movie seemed bored with itself, so it added stupid smart-aleck sayings by Van Helsing-almost none of which were funny. Jackman looked out of place in this role-no wonder he originally refused it. He doesn't know what to do with the character, but it's not his fault. It's the script's fault, and I suppose that Van Helsing is the best you can do with a crappy script like this one.My rating: 4/10Rated PG-13 for nonstop creature action violence and frightening images, and for sensuality.",Null,0,1,18 May 2004
Being John Malkovich," Being John Malkovich: 6/10
","In Spike Jonze's overrated but fine movie Being John Malkovich, John Cusack is Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer. He lives with his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz), who is an animal lover, but we never find out her job. Craig needs a job so he gets a job on the 7¬Ω floor of an office building. Soon he discovers a portal into the head of actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich). Weirdness ensues.Cusack is unrecognizable, and so is Diaz, but not Catherine Keener, who plays Maxine, someone else who works on the 7¬Ω floor. I found that the quasi-romantic quality between Cusack and Keener was one-sided. Keener's acting was rather stiff; I was disappointed. Cusack was quite good, if a little forced at times; it seems like he was forced into doing this movie. Diaz was okay, but nothing remarkable. As I said before, Keener's acting was flat. Malkovich actually was good, I was pleasantly surprised.The story is unusually mellow, going for a lot of the movie without music. It would make more sense to bring out the mood of the piece. I also felt like Jonze underplayed the fantasy element. Sure, I liked the 7¬Ω floor and the portal, but if they had used more special effects (imagine a day where someone would say that) it would have been more believable, not that this concept is one that happens every day. The ending, which includes Craig's boss Dr. Lester (Orson Bean), seemed too out there and out of the blue. Many times, we were expected to think `Oh, of course!' because they rarely explained anything. I did find it amusing at first, but after awhile it got annoying.At the beginning there were lots of laughs, but they soon became sporadic and smaller. Of course, this isn't a film where everyone is telling one-liners, but if they had, as I've said before, put in special effects, maybe humorous ones, it would have made the movie more enjoyable. It was very entertaining and imaginative, though. Only Jonze could think of something this twisted. I had no idea where this roller coaster was going to stop or if I'd just be stuck in the loop-the-loop for 105 minutes.To me, it looks like Jonze is a puppet fan, glamorizing puppets all throughout the movie. I didn't like the `first ending', where everything slows down, but the last one I did like a lot. That doesn't make any sense, right? Well, where you think the conclusion is I didn't like, but the denouement I enjoyed. There's not much more I can say about this flawed but enjoyable comedy.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language and sexuality.",6,2,4,12 January 2003
Collateral," Collateral: 6/10
","There's nothing better than going into a movie you thought would be bad and walking out pleasantly surprised. There's nothing worse than going into a movie you expect to be great and come out with a feeling of mediocrity. The latter is how I felt about Collateral (not to be confused with the Schwarzenegger Collateral Damage), one of the movies for which I was most excited in the summer. Both of the trailers looked great, with them seeming dark and being an action film with a dramatic overtone. Instead, we get a film that has its moments, but just doesn't know what to be. Is it a drama? Is it an action movie? Is it a comedy? I don't agree with the third, but everyone in the test audience was cracking up like crazy. I doubt that that's a great sign for a movie like this.Max (Jamie Foxx) is a cab driver stuck in a rut. He picks up a woman (Jada Pinkett Smith) in his cab, and gets her phone number. It started like any other night. Then Vincent (Tom Cruise) enters the cab and pays him off to drive around to five different locations for 'real estate' deals. When a body falls onto Max's cab, however, it seems that Vincent is going around killing people, as he's a contract killer. Max then has to go along with Vincent, because it's good to have a good argument, but better to have a good argument with a gun in your hand.I didn't know whether Collateral would be a thriller, an action, or a drama, but I was prepared for any. What I got was an uneasy combination of the three. The movie begins in a somber way-something that a good drama could have cone out of. There's a few action scenes thrown in (they're actually pretty cool-they'd be better if this was actually an action movie), and the music was so unbearable loud you'd think it was a thriller. I mean it, the music (by James Newton Howard) was so obnoxious and it played the emotions so much that it is the one factor that ruined the film for me. For example, Max calls Annie (Smith) on a cell phone, and I was literally about to yell out to the screen that she wouldn't be able to hear him talk because the music was so loud. What was Michael Mann thinking?Speaking of Mann, he does a great directing job here. He chooses a unique style, which isn't always good (like Man on Fire), but here it works. He keeps only a small amount of the screen in focus by using a telephoto lens, which really emphasizes the characters, which are both well developed. The cinematography in general was very good, with quite a few helicopter shots, and the whole thing's pretty steady for what looked like to be a hand-held camera. Although the quick cuts were necessary in the action scenes, they weren't overdone, which I felt thankful for. Everything technical looked very deliberate-and I can only attribute that to Mann. Although he won't be, it would be great to see him nominated for Best Director. He wasn't the one responsible for the uneven script, but he did make it constantly interesting. At times, it's interesting but unexciting, then it's interesting and exciting, then it's interesting and boring. At least it's always interesting.Foxx, best known for his roles in stupid comedies (except 2001's Ali, also directed by Mann), really proves himself here. He puts in an outstanding acting job here, alienating himself from his previous, fluff roles. Cruise seems to be paychecking his way through, although, since he's a generally good actor, he does a good job. Although the movie overstays its two hour welcome (the ending seemed especially drawn out and clich√©d (that's just not possible), Collateral is a different film, to say the least. It's a combination of genres, but, unlike, say, Donnie Darko, it doesn't work that well like that.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence and language.",6,1,3,29 July 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: 8/10
","Finally! A breath of fresh air comes to the Harry Potter series! After the two good, but not great, films directed by Chris Columbus, which were both pretty much the same, something new had to come to the series. Something that could take this series and spin it in a whole new direction. Something to make this children's series a bit less childish. That something is director Alfonso Cuaron.The titular wizard (Daniel Radcliffe) is back for his third year of wizarding school at Hogwarts. After defeating the evil wizard Voldemore twice already, he learns that a serial killer, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), has escaped from Azkaban prison and is out to get him. In addition, the prison guards, computer-generated Dementors, come to Hogwarts looking for Black, but seem to affect Harry, also. Add some more teenage angst (after all, these people are 13), and you've got a recipe for a great third film of a series.It's sad to see how much of an asset Cuaron is to the Harry Potter series to see all of his talent go down the drain by a truly awful script by Steven Kloves. His first two scripts were mediocre-just general, basically stealing exactly from the book. But this script, being that it's based off the longest of three books so far made into movies (and it's the best of the five so far), his first mistake is making it shorter than the first two. A book that's maybe 75 pages longer than the others shouldn't be 20-30 minutes less than those. The movie's really for those who have read the books, because most of the things that are crucial are just referenced to in the movie. Many other crucial details are just plain left out in order for more 'humor' involving the Whomping Willow tree.But now I have to praise Cuaron. He takes the mess that is Kloves' script and does the best he can with it, which is pretty good. As I said previously, the first two movies were pretty childish and by-the-book, so to speak. Here, Cuaron uses adult stylings to make this movie more open to adults. Instead of showing off what he can do with special effects, he uses them minimally, basically as an understatement, just using them whenever necessary. Therefore, this scarcity of the special effects made them more welcome. Although the werewolf that comes in at the end of the movie looked like it was something straight out of Van Helsing, at least it wasn't too overdone.I also have to applaud Cuaron for his artistic license. In Kloves' previous scripts, he had a few Quidditch games that went on for way too long, brought nothing to the table, and looked way too fake. Here, there's only one that's short and has a purpose. Although everything had a purpose in J.K. Rowling's books, here much felt rushed and just there to get it out of the way. That's what it's like in Azkaban, also, but it, for the most part, works, since I have read the books. Much of what was needed to make the books work weren't in the movie and were omitted for the relationship between the characters to build. And it worked. You could see the palpable bonding between most of the characters. That's why this movie is better than the first two: it spends more time on what we actually care about: the characters, not how much money they had in the budget to create special effects.Sure, I have a few complaints, such as John Cleese not coming back as the ghost Nearly-Headless-Nick, Gary Oldman's underuse, and other minor details. But for the most part, Cuaron saves a movie series from a line of childish directing and terrible writing and turns it into something that is very real and something that other series (such as the Lord of the Rings) could have used.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for frightening moments, creature violence and mild language.",8,0,0,6 June 2004
Spirited Away," Spirited Away: 10/10
","Alice in Wonderland, eat your heart out, there's a new fantasy that surpasses you. Spirited Away is one great film with superb animation and characters you actually care about.Chihiro is voiced by Daveigh Chase, aka Lilo from Lilo and Stitch. She and her family are moving and are almost at their new house when a wrong turn leads them into a tunnel. It begins like a Scooby-Doo episode. Mysterious characters running around an abandoned theme park. But the rest of the movie unfolds like no other. A feast is layed out, and Chihiro's parents start pigging out and-of course-turn into pigs. Soon other characters come out and Chihiro flees for her life. Various, and odd, events ensue.I have got to say-if there was ever a movie for everyone in the family to enjoy, this is the one! Interesting characters, interesting events, and interesting visuals encourage a very interesting moviegoing experience. We have got to hand it to Miyazaki (the director), he's created another world that will stick with us for the rest of our sane lives.I'm not into anim√É¬® at all, but the animation was-wow! It looked like two different settings-the very realistic background and the obvious characters. The emotions on the humans were very real (or as real as this movie could be). All of the various 'others' from the opposite world were life-like and seemed real. However, there was one thing that I didn't fully understand-what was the purpose of No-Face? He could have been just in there for linking purposes, but it doesn't really bother me one iota.A lot of times, my heart was a'going th-thump. There were many tense moments, many funny moments, and many, many powerful, dramatic moments. You smile when Chihiro is happy; you're sad when she is sad. There are some movies that can make you do that, but not many. A very creepy moviegoing experience.The 124 minute runtime seemed to run by quick. It felt like awhile for the movie, but you hardly noticed it. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. When I walked out, I heard some other kid say, 'It was OK, I guess.' Spirited Away is not really a little kid's movie. They'll be too scared and will not be able to fully grasp the potential of the film. They also seemed upset because it was 'so long'. Don't go to many more movies, kiddos. This'll seem like a commercial.Miyazaki, if I could, I would shake your hand. You've created a masterpiece, plain and simple.My rating: 10/10Rated PG for scary moments and a surprising amount of blood.",10,2,3,20 October 2002
The Usual Suspects," The Usual Suspects: 7/10
","Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects is one of the few famous movies now that still has an aura of mystery around its ending. Meaning, of course, that I've stumbled upon it, so there was no real surprise for me about it, but I'll get to that later. The Usual Suspects won two Oscars: best supporting actor (Kevin Spacey), and best original screenplay (Christopher McQuarrie). Both were won deservedly, but it should have also won Most Confusing Screenplay and Most Stuff Happening On Screen At One Time So It Is Hard To Tell What Is Happening.Five criminals, McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal Kint (Spacey), are all in a line-up, when there is usually one suspect. They suspect something, and aim to get revenge, but someone higher up is controlling them. If you understand this plot fully, please tell me.Since I knew the ending, there was no mystery, but I still found The Usual Suspects to be engaging and never boring. I knew the ending, who Keyser Soze was, but not how he was involved, so that added another interesting aspect to it. The acting and chemistry made the not-quite-believable scenario that they're in. Spacey, who was really more in a main role than supporting, wasn't as good as his other Oscar-winning role in American Beauty, but he was quite good. Everyone else was very good also, and had amazing chemistry with each other (think Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid chemistry).If you've read about the ending, you can still appreciate how it is unraveled (only paralled to The Sixth Sense on how it's revealed), as I sure did. Overall, The Usual Suspects is an entertaining, if suspense-less movie that I think everyone in their life will see at least once.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong language.",Null,0,1,18 August 2003
The Butterfly Effect," The Butterfly Effect: 5/10
","Ashton Kutcher is one of the most, if not the most, overexposed 'celebrity' now. Most people can't even name a movie he was in. I'm not a big fan of That 70's Show, where he made his name known, but after he made Dude, Where's My Car?, I don't think anyone thought he could ever be a credible actor. And The Butterfly Effect proves it. From a story that has been floating around Hollywood for years (it took someone with the star power and epic acting skills of Kutcher to get it greenlighted), The Butterfly Effect has a great idea but is executed in such a mixed bag kind of way it's hard to like it.Evan (Kutcher) has gone through a troubled childhood (filled with the stupidest kids you've even seen on film), and had experienced numerous blackouts. He's better now, but finds a way to go back in time to change the horrifying events of his past. What he doesn't realize (until the end-most people would've caught on as soon as possible) that everything he does affects his whole life ahead of him. It seems to affect Kayleigh (Amy Smart) the most in each one, where she goes from sorority girl to waitress to prostitute. The like happens to everyone else Evan knows. But no matter how much he screws it up, he keeps on truckin' so that his life is perfect.This story is much like Donnie Darko (as it has been said multiple times), but Darko knows where its going and has a purpose. In The Butterfly Effect, it takes itself way too seriously. The first half of the movie is basically Evan's past, where troubling events take place. The second half is Evan going back to fix his mistakes. The worst part is, Evan doesn't even think of helping others with these powers of his. There's a scene in a movie theater (where they're showing two New Line Cinema movies, obviously), and some people unrelated to him get hurt. Why not go back and stop that? Also, when Evan goes back to save a mother and daughter, he does it for himself, not for the people that would be killed. And we're supposed to feel along with this selfish character? In a movie as dark and serious as this, it deals with silly topics, like time travel. Time travel only works humorously (Back to the Future) or when explained properly (Donnie Darko). Neither occur in The Butterfly Effect. I had been told many times that to like this movie I couldn't take it seriously. I tried not to, but the events that occur in the movie (including child porn and animal abuse) are impossible to take lightly. At least the movie deals with them in a serious matter.The concept is a pretty cool concept, but once again, it's destroyed by the actual dialogue written. It's all so basic and clich√©d I could basically guess what they were about to say next. Also, why must they have begun with a scene of the climax? Movies always do that, often for a purpose. There was no reason here. The whole movie was uneven-half of the movie was basically revisited over and over again in the second half, which unnecessarily spends much of its time in a prison. On another note, I liked the way that everything tied together (I'm not talking about the ending) and that the unanswered questions from throughout the movie were eventually taken into consideration, such as the purpose of Evan's blackouts. I watched the director's cut, and the alternate ending seemed gutsy, but I really liked it. I read about the other ending, and I prefer this one.This almost seemed like a typical teen movie (more so than it already is) by the acting. Kutcher can't act worth beans, and Amy Smart isn't exactly Katherine Hepburn either. The only two remarkable people in the cast were Eric Stoltz (as the aforementioned child pornographer) and Ethan Suplee (as Evan's Goth roomate), who always put in great acting jobs. But this movie, which is sure to wow the MTV generation, has a great idea at its fingertips, but can't seem the right way to execute it.My rating: 5/10Rated R for violence, sexual content, language and brief drug use.",5,4,9,11 July 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Alien vs. Predator: 3/10
","I suppose Hollywood will never run out of movies, especially horror movies. Not only can they make endless sequels (there's been 10 Friday the 13ths?), but they can also have the characters fight each other in new movies (such as Freddy vs. Jason). That's the case with Alien vs. Predator, two characters that are both owned by 20th Century Fox who couldn't meet in real life but meet in an underground pyramid underneath Antarctica. Add into the mix a half dozen random characters played by people no one has ever heard of (save Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen), as you guess the order in which they'll die. Sounds like a fun time, eh? Uh, yeah, if you're a masochist.A group of supposedly experienced adventurers (we see a few of them in various exciting activities in the beginning) travel down to Antarctica to see the aforementioned pyramid that is just found 2,000 feet underground. It turns out that both the aliens from the Alien series and the Predators from the Predator series fight each other. The humans are caught in the midst, as they try to escape. Stupidity ensues.The whole plot is convoluted and stupid. These characters (who we don't care about at all) don't really do much for half of the runtime as we see glimpses of the title characters, when they attack for no reason at all. Then, halfway through, it turns out that some alien hieroglyphics (that humans can read quickly) are found in the pyramid and tell the complete history of the creature that created the pyramid (and more). It's quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever seen...EVER! And then one of the creatures help the humans destroy the other...aargh. It's just so absurd that it crosses the 'it's so bad it's good' line to 'it's so bad it's bad.' All of this is the fault of writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson (who is credited in three SEPARATE credits, in a row, in the ending credits). His script is generic Hollywood bullplop, the kind you can get for a dime a dozen by any writer waiting tables in Hollywood. The directing is strictly PG-13 and MTV-quick cuts and cut aways as soon as a character's about to die, destroying what people liked about the Alien and Predator movies. By keeping it PG-13, it can get more people into the audience, but it takes out the language and the gore that the fans of the respective series liked so much about those movies.All of this could be overlooked if it did its job: thrilled, or even entertained. Alien vs. Predator did neither. The only part that could be considered thrilling is the music, which could be found anywhere. And the most entertaining part of the movie is when I found myself laughing at how stupid the whole thing is. The action's incomprehensible because everything's the exact same color, and most of it's computer generated, which makes it basically uninteresting. Going back to Anderson's script, there's at least three or four elements stolen from other movies. There's a complete quote stolen from True Romance, a scene stolen from The One, the whole concept of the pyramid stolen from Cube...the list goes on and on. Something this unoriginal can't be exciting anyway. And it isn't. The whole movie's not worth it. Even if Alien and Predator movies are your six favorite movies of all time, don't see Alien vs. Predator.My rating: 3/10Rated PG-13 for violence, language, horror images, slime and gore.",3,24,51,15 August 2004
Liar Liar," Liar Liar: 6/10
","Jim Carrey can be funny when he wants to be. Although he isn't the greatest comedian, he's sometimes quuite funny. His attempts at dramatic work aren't half bad, either. His prime of comedies came in the late 90's, with such movies like Liar Liar. In it, the script's written for him and he doesn't need to do any acting, just make faces at the camera. That has got to be the world's easiest job.Carrey plays Fletcher Reede, a lawyer who is known for winning a case in any way possible. However, he rarely has time for his wife and son, so they break up. And any time that he is supposed to do something with his son, Fletcher never makes it and makes an excuse. So for his son's birthday, he wishes that his father would never tell a lie for one whole day. And lo and behold, it comes true. On the day of Fletcher's most important case, he can't tell a single lie, which causes distress in his job and more.For the most part, Liar Liar is a good comedy. It's entertaining, it's humorous, and a plot that goes someplace. Although some of the subplots don't really go anyplace, or don't really work, like his wife's new relationship, it did open up another trademark Carrey 'funny thing', like The Mask did with 'Smokin'!' and Ace Ventura did with 'All righty then!', and that is the whole thing about The Claw, which is pretty funny. Tom Shadyac seems to know how to direct Carrey and not to really have the camera off of him, which works well, since his constant mugging to the camera and his zany antics are basically what make up the movie.On the downside of everything, though, there's one thing that takes away from the movie. That's the lack of laughter that was going through me. Although it's very entertaining, and something I would be able to watch again, I never really laughed much, I was just entertained throughout, which is all I asked for.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for sex related humor and language.",6,0,3,4 March 2004
Meet the Fockers," Meet the Fockers: 8/10
","Can you remember all the way back to 2000? Julia Roberts stole her Oscar from Ellen Burstyn, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon opened the door for mainstream foreign movies, and Meet the Parents was nominated for one-only one-Oscar: Best Original Song. No Best Supporting Actor for the toilet-using Jinx the Cat. No Best Director for the scene where the human waste flies onto the house. Meet the Parents was robbed, I tell ya! Well, not really, but it surprised many people, especially skeptics thinking that Robert De Niro couldn't do comedy. Obviously, they were proved wrong, and therefore there were no surprises when Meet the Fockers came out. Except that this movie also featured Dustin Hoffman in his latest role (his fourth of the year) and Barbra Streisand in her first role since God knows when. Actually, strike that. I was surprised by Fockers, because I actually liked it. A lot.Gaylord 'Greg' Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), whose marriage was approved by Pam's parents Jack (De Niro) and Dina (Blythe Danner) in Parents, now have to go to Greg's parents before the wedding. The straight-laced Byrneses are in for a surprise when meeting Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand) Focker. A liberal, carefree Florida retired couple, they couldn't clash any more with the Byrneses (of course, would it be much of a movie if they did?) The two families go through mishaps and misunderstandings, with very funny results.One complaint I had with Parents is the sheer impossibility of some of the antics. Someone basically burning a house down, and then letting human waste cover the yard? Not only is it improbable, it's also crude. Focker only really had one scene of toilet humor (literally), and other than that, it was all slapstick or wordplay. Very funny slapstick and wordplay, I might add. Hoffman and Streisand play amazingly well off each other and everyone else. The casting of those two is probably the best casting choice of the year. This may be Hoffman's best role since The Graduate-no lie. The completely off the wall way he plays Bernie is great and really works well for the movie. In fact, all of the performances are great.Not only that, but it's also funny as hell. It's mainly the typical zany mishap comedy, but there's a lot of great dialogue, too. The addition of a baby, Little Jack, added a good amount of humor (adding to the minor 'breast pump' issue of the first movie). But LJ seemed to just be a necessity, to show that, yes, the two movies are different (as if the addition of Hoffman and Streisand weren't enough). Still, the laughs were constant and strong, something that can't really be said about almost any other comedy that's come out within the past five or so years (except for, of course Parents). Although I've been so tardy with my reviews (and I saw Fockers late in its run), I'd really suggest this movie. If you liked Parents, you'll like this one even more.My rating: 8/10 Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language and a brief drug reference.",8,0,1,11 March 2005
Before Sunset," Before Sunset: 10/10
","Most of the time, sequels are for big budget summer blockbusters when studios realize they can double their profits by releasing a movie that's basically the same. So I assume most people were surprised that Before Sunrise, a small romance that only made about $5.5 million would warrant a sequel. But it did. I haven't seen the first one, which was released in 1995, but that didn't stop me from seeing its sequel, Before Sunset. I have learned that you usually don't need to see the first movie in series to understand it. Some enjoyment may fall out of it, but it's still coherent nonetheless. Before Sunset is a sequel where you don't need to see the first. In fact, I think I probably benifited from not seeing the first.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is promoting his book, which is largely based on the events of the evening in Before Sunrise, where he had met Celeste (Julie Delpy) in Vienna and spent an unforgettable night. They had agreed to meet up again in six months in Vienna. Celeste finds Jesse after the book signing and they talk. They walk around Paris and talk. And talk. And talk.It's movie like this that you recognize as being great, yet you can't really explain it. It could be how much I seemed to get to know and like these characters just by hearing them talk. The camera never leaves them, which makes us seem like intruders and eavesdroppers to their life. It could be the simplicity of their lives that we find fascinating, and how we can relate to both of them in more ways than one. It could be the sophistication of the dialogue (which was written by director Richard Linklater, Hawke, and Delpy). The spontaneity of the dialogue makes the movie feel more real. And it's all in real time, which adds a sense of urgency to the movie.Both Hawke and Delpy, who are basically the only characters in the film, put in good acting jobs here. They exhibit the normal characteristics of life-they aren't over the top or caricatures. They seem just like average people, and that adds to the charm and the overall real feel to the movie. They have forgotten some of the events of the evening nine years ago (as would the viewer). The constant barrage of dialogue doesn't hurt it; actually, it's very entertaining and interesting. They talk about various subjects, and you never feel time dragging or anything of the like. Before Sunset is simply a beautiful film. It's simplistic and down to earth. You may not like my lack of words to describe it, but once you see it, you'll be at a loss for words, also.My rating: 10/10Rated R for language and sexual references.",10,2,3,18 July 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan: 7/10
","It's tough being a teenager now. You have to catch up on all types of movies. Classics, older movies, and newer movies you may have missed. When Saving Private Ryan opened in 1998, I, of course, wasn't allowed to see it, nor would I have been interested in seeing it. But now, everyone at school's buzzing about that movie, saying how great it is. I finally gave into peer pressure and rented it, and it's quite a good movie. It's just not the extraordinary classic that it's made out to be.The time is World War II. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent to fetch the title character, hence saving him and making the title make sense. Why send out eight people to rescue just one private? His three brothers, who were also in the war, were killed, so basically eight men are sent out to ease Mrs. Ryan. Obviously, when they finally reach him, there is resentment.The movie opens with a flashback to the war, as every single war movie seems to do! Why is this always necessary? That means we know that some people survive, taking some tension out. At least we usually can't figure out who yet. Then it goes in with a bang, at a loud, exciting war scene that doesn't really have much to do with the rest of the plot, but it's very exciting. The only problem is that it pads out the movie to an obnoxiously long 170 minutes and since it isn't necessary, it didn't HAVE to be in the movie.While the movie is quite long, it's never boring, not at all, but some parts aren't very interesting. Also, since it's a Spielberg investment, every single character has to have a backstory, meaning that smack dab in the middle of the movie, everyone must reminisce about what their life was, even those whose names we don't know, meaning that right when it's getting good, it goes off to left field.The war scenes were incredibly realistic, as far as I can tell. Although graphic at times, it's obvious how painstakingly hard they worked to make it seem like you were actually there, no matter where you were, including watching it on a 5' screen. Also, I think something else that added to the realism is that Spielberg kept the camera to a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Therefore, he was centralizing in on the action, what needed to be shown, and what doesn't need to be shown.Saving Private Ryan ebbs and flows. At times there's heartpounding action, at others it's just watchable so you can continue on with the plot. But however you feel about this movie, you have to admit that it's one of the most realistic war films ever made.My rating: 7/10Rated R for war violence and language.",Null,0,0,1 February 2004
The Pianist," The Pianist: 8/10
","Nominated for seven Academy Awards and winner of three, Roman Polanski's The Pianist is deserving in two of those three. Polanski's directing is superb, clearly the work of a master, and Ronald Harwood's screenplay is deeply moving and shocking. However, Adrien Brody should not have won, considering he was against Jack Nicholson in one of his greatest acting showcases, About Schmidt. I'll get into that later.Brody is Wladyslaw Szpilman. He's a pianist for Polish radio and he's Jewish. Being Jewish isn't exactly the greatest thing to be in Warsaw in the height of World War II, so him and his family has to move to a ghetto. However, his family is taken away, and the ghetto is destroyed, so Szpilman has to survive in the world with the help of others.The Pianist is touching and well thought out, with powerful moments throughout. It really makes us look at what we take for granted, and realize how lucky we are. Szpilman had to struggle just to get water to survive, yet we complain on when we have water out of the tap instead of `purified' spring water. Anyone in a luxury life should really check this movie out.It basically was a one-man show, and Brody could have been a lot better, since he basically was the movie. Although I see how he was nominated, because this role was a taxing one, I don't really see how anyone could consider this role the best acting job of the year. Clearly, Jack should have won.The cinematography was also superb. One shot I particularly liked is when Szpilman was walking through the completely destroyed city and a giant pan shot moving backwards. It was totally effective and I felt drawn in. It made me feel even more sorry for everything that happened there. I wish I had something more to say about The Pianist, besides that it's a harrowing two-and-a-half hours that affects you deeply.My rating: 8/10Rated R for violence and brief strong language.",8,0,1,14 April 2003
The Transporter," The Transporter: 6/10
","Car chases are about the coolest stunt in an action movie. To my latest count, The Transporter had three.Frank (Jason Statham) is a transporter: he delievers packages from one bad guy to the next, no questions asked. Or he may even carry passangers, as seen from the first scene. But when he opens a package that seems to be moving and screaming, things start to turn to the worse. Soon everybody is trailing Frank and trying to kill him. Just an ordiniary day in the life of a transporter.The opening car chase scene is the coolest one I've ever seen in movies. Sure it's unlikely (nay...impossible), but this movie isn't about what can happen in real life. The subsequent chases pale in comparision, but are still pretty cool.The plot, however, is anything but cool. In the first half, the plot was the consequence of opening the package. In the second half, it's about 400 Asian immigrants and the girl (Qi Shu) from the package's father working for the bad guy. Or something like that. Action movies like this are supposed to have you not really think about anything except for basic plot and explosions (like the one at the rest stop...awesome!), but you had to follow the plot or else you wouldn't understand what was happening.The best non-car-chase fight sequence was in the bus station. Buses...$35,000. Fighting ten guys on an oiled floor...priceless. At some times, Statham's moves seemed like he was break-dancing. Speaking of Statham, he could be the next action hero. With his Bond-like stunts and his Diesel-like build, move over Brosnan! There's a new hero in town.Shu was good as a girl with tape over her mouth, but she soon became an obnoxious person who wasn't fun to be with. Shu, and almost everyone else in the movie, had accents that were hard to understand a lot of times. If they learned anything from The Osbournes, it is that they can put subtitles in English-it'll help!The music was right on-key, helping tense the situation and then relax us, and then tense us up again. In the beginning, the sound FX really helped to bring out the quality of the sound. Music can be obnoxious if used in the wrong places, but in some places, like The Transporter, it helps bring out the mood.The bad guys, on the con side of the film, were so one-dimensional that they must have aced Stupid Bad Guys 101. On the test: Question 1: True or False: When the person you're supposed to kill disappears, just assume that he died. They must of tried to kill him and 'succeeded' three times. What a load of idiots. And some of the film was so utterly unbelieveable. Statham just knows how to scuba-dive, parachute, has a giant house with an underwater passage to another house connected to it and has a million Mercedeses. Right...Well, enough of my mumbo-jumbo. If you just skipped down here to have me cut to the chase, here it is: Fun, mucho action, and some awesome chases counter against one-dimensional bad guys and horrible plot. I'm not sure if I recommend it or not, I guess just see it for yourself to figure it out.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for strong action violence and some language.",6,0,1,26 October 2002
Seabiscuit," Seabiscuit: 7/10
","What are the three words that strike fear into the hearts of men everywhere? Those three little words: `A true story'. Usually when a story is Hollywoodized, it loses its dramatic impact and adds on sap. Although I have not read the book by Laura Hillenbrand, it's evident that the story of Seabiscuit was not jazzed up much for the theaters. It's not bubbling with sentiment, such as based-on-true-story movies usually are, and it has an authentic feel to it that makes Seabiscuit seem levelheaded, not conceited, and therefore tells a long, interesting, and predictable story that takes place in the Depression.For the first third of this three-part film, we see Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) become a great car salesman, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) is a trainer who can calm the wildest horse, and Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), a literate, well-to-do boy who becomes a jockey. Then all of them meet and raise a horse, Seabiscuit, a wild and untimely horse whose backstory we find out but don't really care that much about. Although rather large for a jockey, Red rides Seabiscuit, who is rather small for a racehorse, trained by Tom, who is rather old for a trainer, and owned by Charles, who, as he says, is `too dumb to know the difference.'In many ways, Seabiscuit is 2003's Road to Perdition. Both are early Oscar contenders, and are widely critically acclaimed, but probably won't bust the box office. Both have Oscar-winning actors in its cast. However, Seabiscuit is also different in many ways. Mainly, I found the first part of it almost boring, not very exciting. The subplot with literature in Red's family wasn't executed as well as it could have been, and, frankly, didn't like Red in the beginning simply because of his family. Of course, he grows on you, and soon you're rooting for him.Bridges, yet again, acts greatly, and will probably be overlooked by the Academy, simply because he isn't in an `Oscar movie', a movie made just to win Oscars. Although he probably shouldn't win, at least give the man a nomination! Cooper proves once again that just because he has an Oscar he's a great actor. He was superb in American Beauty, but just acceptable in Adaptation., and here he's also just acceptable. He, thankfully, is not in many scenes. Maguire doesn't act, instead his badly dyed hair does. It's scarier than your great-grandfather without his teeth in.Yet, of course, the best parts of Seabiscuit are the racing scenes. Although it's obvious that a camera was just hooked up to a horse or something behind them, with the Surround Sound and everything, it really seems like you're in the action. It's extremely predictable what's going to happen, but even still I was so excited, I was surprised. I was just about ready to jump up for joy! It's great filmmaking (from Gary Ross, Pleasantville) that can make you feel that: predictability and yet excitement. Seabiscuit's pace ebbs and flows, but overall you won't be disappointed if you take a trip out to your local multiplex.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for some sexual situations and violent sports-related images.",7,0,0,25 July 2003
28 Days Later...," 28 Days Later: 7/10
","Not since the classic Night of the Living Dead have we seen a good, creepy zombie movie. And it looks like it will be awhile more. Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later is barely scary, but if you take it for what it really is, a creative drama, it's pretty good. However, instead of the position of Venus, animal rights activists release contaminated apes to the world, which are infected with rage. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma and finds London completely deserted. He sees some attacking zombies, but Mark (Noah Huntley) and Selena (Naomie Harris) ward them off. Soon he goes along with them to try to find other survivors, but to also try and find a cure.Although there have been attempts, the last good horror film was Identity. 28 Days Later tries to be a horror film by putting in a few quick and semi-suspenseful scenes. All before the final, concluding sequence (which is the film's greatest sequence), are quick, five-second shots of zombies trying to attack people. Boyle has the camera moving so quickly during those sequences it's impossible to tell what's happening. Of course, we could see all of the blood, because there's plenty of it, but at times it looked real, but many times it was false.28 Days Later, which I originally thought was a sequel to the Sandra Bullock romantic comedy 28 Days, really makes itself a good movie by putting in a scenario we've all thought about but never really see in movies. The end of the world is always an interesting subject: when will it happen, how will it occur, etc. This explores one way: an infectious virus. It probably would have played better if we didn't know how London was empty, but the way writer Alex Garland made it work, also.In between those scarce horror sequences, some good drama plays out. We learn more about the virus, but I thought that the relationship between Jim and Selena was very well done. Movies like this have a limited amount of characters, making us like the ones that are there. I wouldn't call it a character-driven piece, nor a character study, but it certainly has interesting characters.If you're looking for a typical zombie-horror movie, look somewhere else. If you want a drama with intense scenes (and an AWESOME score), check out 28 Days Later.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong violence and gore, language, and nudity.",7,0,0,4 July 2003
Hellboy," Hellboy: 6/10
","Expectations have been set way too high now. Every time a movie based on a comic book comes out, everyone expects it to be the next , when a) most, if not all, of the popular comic book franchises have already been made into movies, and b) most comic book movies can't compare to Spider-Man. Yet these movies keep getting pumped out methodically, and people buy into them. I am one of those people, so on its opening weekend, I saw Hellboy, a lesser known comic-movie. There's obviously a reason why it's like that. Hellboy may be an interesting character, but his surroundings aren't.Ron Perlman plays the title character, a demon transported from hell during the Nazi regime. He's brought up by Prof. Broom (John Hurt, I'll get to him later), and soon helps out the American government in controlling paranormal creatures. However, it turns out he has human feelings and all, and must face his inner demons, so to speak.I must admit, going into Hellboy, I had high expectations. The trailers looked cool, and I thought it could surpass Spider-Man and get into Hulk territory. But I was wrong. Everything that went right in the two previously mentioned movies didn't happen in this one. The exciting originality and spontaniety of Spider-Man was thrown away in lieu of cheesy special effects. And the stunning story and depth in The Hulk was nowhere to be seen here. But I shouldn't be judging this movie based on others.In short, Hellboy is generic. Although the plot was far-out, it didn't go that far with it, and ended up just being a generic 'kick the bad guy's ass' scenario. Any of the fight scenes seemed completely fake, until you realized that Hellboy was just a guy in makeup. Then I was in awe, but the sheer awkwardness of the computer animation just seemed off. Hellboy's makeup, though, was great; it seemed perfectly flawless (although I did see an image afterwards where some of his fingers were visible when there were supposed to be incased in a wooden arm), and was probably the highest point of the movie. The movie in itself was entertaining, but just not as gripping as it could be.Perlman is a great Hellboy. He stands out among this cast that could have gone for A-list stars but didn't. Hurt seemed to underplay his role. Ironically, Hurt played the title character in The Elephant Man, and I found these two movies similar, as they both deal with ostricizacation due basically to looks. Selma Blair, as the love interest, does what she can with her one note character, but she can't really do much with it.All in all, Hellboy is entertaining, generally. There's nothing new. Just some PG-13 blow 'em up, and that's it. Destined to not be a classic.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and frightening images.",6,0,1,4 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Two Towers: 5/10
","Ho hum. In Peter Jackson's second movie of the three books, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is trying to deliever the ring of power to the fire in middle earth, since that is where it was created, that is where it can be destroyed. Along with him is his friend Samwise (Sean Astin), who refers to his friend as 'Mr. Frodo'. Something about that strikes me as just weird. The other members of the broken fellowship (how did they break up? I don't remember, I saw the first one a year ago and I'm not an avid fan) seem to be trying to tag along. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), a human, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), an elf, and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), a dwarf, try to trace the trail of Frodo and Sam. Two more hobbits, Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) get lost and are aided by talking and walking trees (!). Confused yet?The one-minute-shy-of-three-hours runtime seems somewhat padded, maybe so it can keep up its reputation. Jackson tried to stay faithful to the book, but kept too close. For the record, I have not read any of the books. If everything about Pippin and Merry had been taken out, it would have been easier to tolerate.To improve, they needed a more over-the-top climactic fight scene. In the first one it was the mines of Morea (sp?). This time it's Helm's Deep. With thousands of fighters, it's pure fun right? Wrong. It goes on for way too long, and after a while, it becomes, dare I say, boring? The first hour or so was fine, fun, and enjoyable. In the second hour, when characters came in and out and Jackson expected us to know everyone from the book, it drags a little. The third hour is just pure chaos, with not real rhyme to the reason.It also seemed like everyone who died came back to life. I know this is a magical world, but come on! After falling off a cliff? Gimme a break. All of the acting was fine (Astin's may have been best), but I still don't know who a lot of the characters were.Added to the mix is a computer animated character named Gollum, who sounds (and looks) a lot like Dobby from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He was once a hobbit, but came under the spell of the ring, and he's dying to get his hands on it. So he helps out Frodo and Sam to get to where they need to go. Oh yeah, he also has split personality for a bit of comic relief.The cinematography seemed to either be long, wide, sweeping and beautiful shots or grotesque close-ups of Gollum or rotted faces of Orcs. Not exactly a pretty picture. The Two Towers doesn't have anything to do with the title (unless, of course, it was mentioned when I was in the bathroom). It's mainly a continuation of the first film, a transition between numbers one and three. And what was with Aragorn's dream type things? Maybe I should read the books.The Two Towers is entertaining but deeply flawed by its meaningless plot and boring fights. Its visuals are stunning, but little else in the movie is.My rating: 5/10Rated PG-13 for epic battle sequences and scary images.",5,0,0,20 December 2002
Schindler's List," Schindler's List: 8/10
","Eventually, I would have had to have seen Schindler's List. Not only was it a staple in modern filmmaking, but I'm also Jewish and have been taught all about the Holocaust. I like Spielberg, and I can sit through long movies (although I did watch the movie in three pieces), so I plunked this newly released DVD into my player and was treated to an adventure, the likes of which I had never seen before.Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German during World War II. All he cares about is money, and runs a business while the height of the Nazi regime in Poland is taking place. He realizes that he can save money on hiring Jews instead of Poles to work in his factory (since the Jews would be taken from the concentration camps, they would not really require much, if any, pay). After some pleading from his wife and his desire to hold onto his accountant, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kinglsey), Schindler decides to make a list of Jews to save from certain death to work in his factory.Quite obviously, this movie will have different effects on different people, much like the recent Passion of the Christ did. Those who had relatives who were captured by the Nazis, or knew someone, or were alive at the time, or anything of the like, would be much more affected by this film than others. I found myself horrified by many of the atrocities brutally shown, especially ones done by Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes). It's amazing, how you can be so affected by gruesomeness done to characters you know nothing about.On a lesser side, I found many scenes to be unnecessary and uninteresting. They only added to the already obscenely long runtime. Also, the character of Goeth, when not brutalizing Jews, seemed to become perfectly normal and balanced. Goeth seemed duplicitous, and therefore somewhat unbelievable. Neeson was good, but Kingsley was excellent. One more thing that bothered me was the girl in the red dress. Filmed in almost all black-and-white, there's some sort of symbolism there, but there's no telling what it is.Overall, Schindler's List is an important film, and a tough one to get through, but what you'll get out of it will differ from what others will.My rating: 8/10Rated R for war violence and language.",8,9,13,16 April 2004
The Incredibles," The Incredibles: 8/10
","Being part of that very elite club that didn't think that much of Finding Nemo, I didn't really know what to expect from The Incredibles, another computer generated film by Disney/Pixar. I had heard amazing things about it, but I had also heard amazing things about Nemo. The standard opening short, 'Boundin'', made me doubt how good the actual film would be. But now I see that there's an inverse. Nemo's opening short was the hilarious 'Knick Knack,' and the movie just turned out to be mediocre. Here, 'Boundin'' was quite atrocious, but The Incredibles was great. How could I tell it was great from the beginning? Well, I knew that Pixar made kids films, and the opening scene had a car chase filled with guns firing at each other. I knew this was going to be a different film, and, by golly, I knew I'd love it from then on in.Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) is a superhero, saving his fair city from supervillains. However, when he rescues someone who didn't want to be rescued, it starts a whole line of lawsuits against superheroes, so Mr. Incredible, after his marriage to Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), is forced into retirement. He's now Bob Parr, an insurance agent living with Helen and their three children, Dashiell 'Dash' (Spencer Fox), Violet (Sarah Vowell), and baby Jack-Jack (Jack-Jack? I mean, seriously, JACK-JACK?). A deranged former fan of Mr. Incredible, Buddy Pine (Jason Lee), decides to destroy every former superhero in the world by becoming Syndrome, and Mr. Incredible has to decide whether or not to keep his quiet suburban life to go back into the now illegal field of superheroing.Ever since Toy Story came out, the bar for animation has continually been set higher and higher. And since Shrek, the look of the animation hasn't changed at all. That is, until November 5, 2004, when The Incredibles was released. This being Pixar's first film only featuring human characters, and since human characters were Pixar's weakness in all of their other movies, it's corrected here. And since there's not as much cartoonery here (in relation to Nemo, etc.), everything has do, and does, look a lot more realistic. It's this leap of animation that puts Brad Bird's movie up on the charts. Bird, who did the supposedly underrated The Iron Giant and various work on The Simpsons, took on this arduous task of writing and directing this two-hour long scope CG film. I'd hate to see the man who makes a perfect movie with those qualifications, but I have to say Bird did a damn good job.The greatest asset of The Incredibles is how the story, unlike Nemo, isn't condescending to, or even for, kids. Gunplay, suicide, violence, peril involving young children-this is the type of action movie everyone's been waiting for. The Incredibles can be enjoyed at the same level by any age group. There aren't really many gross gags, like Nemo or other Pixars. In fact, the movie worked great because it's not a comedy. It's an action movie with many funny spots in it. It's like Bird's work on The Simpsons-many of the best episodes are not only funny, but are also fun to watch (which is part of the fault of the newer episodes, but I digress). Since the movie's major focus isn't humor, it can focus on the well-developed characters, the plot, and all of the details. The movie, at two hours long, flew by.People have said that Craig T. Nelson's voicework is unrecognizable, but to them I have this to say: if you saw him and saw him talk, would you be able to recognize him? I thought not. The animation matched his voice perfectly in all of its deadpan glory, so, I suppose in that regard he did a good job. Hunter is pretty good, but Bird, as Edna Mode, is way overrated. I don't understand these people who say that Edna should have her own sequel, but that's another story. Samuel L. Jackson, as 'Frozone', is awesome, as he always is (can he be anything else?), but he's only in about two scenes. Everyone knows that he's awesome, so why make his role so small? I couldn't place Lee's voice at first, but it was basically generic voice-over work. That's the weakest part of The Incredibles, is the voice-over work. Everything else is-dare I say-incredible, that it's brought down by such mediocre voices.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for action violence.",8,0,0,19 November 2004
The Elephant Man," The Elephant Man: 7/10
","It's pretty hard to find a more eccentric director than David Lynch. Of course, he's known for making such films as Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr., but people tend to forget about The Straight Story and The Elephant Man, two of his most touching films. And it's hard to grasp how he made Elephant directly after he made Eraserhead, considering basically the only similarity is that they're both shot in black and white.The Elephant Man stars John Hurt as the title character, real name John Merrick. He has been physically deformed since birth, and spends his life in a freak show around the turn of the century. One day, Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) takes him to his hospital for examination, and realizes that there's more to this person than just his extremely deformed body, from which he gets the name 'Elephant Man'. Some people, however, aren't ready to believe that he's not just a sideshow anymore.It's hard to know where to begin when writing a review for a movie like this. I suppose I'll begin with Lynch's directing. I liked how we weren't able to see what Merrick looked like until a half hour into the film, even though he was an intergral part. The black and white photography, however, didn't really seem to work, because a movie like this could be more expressive, although perhaps the makeup used was oddly colored. Some of the symbolism he used was obvious and a little strong, especially at the beginning.I can't go on in this review without talking about the makeup used on Hurt. It took 12 hours every day to apply, but from the black and white photography, it was hard to tell whether the makeup was extremely good or extremely fake for most of the movie. Near the end, though, I was able to tell how extraordinary the makeup was, helping me feel with the main character more.However, for a lot of the movie (mainly the middle), the plot goes from the examination of Merrick to Merrick talking with regular people. Emotion went with the original plot there, but soon after, quite possibly the most emotionally harrowing scene in the history of movies comes. Hurt does an amazing job as Merrick, and Hopkins puts in a good job as the doctor. Those are the two biggest characters, but the movie revolves around them. Overall it's a very good movie, with some great moments, but some other things fall apart.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for thematic elements.",Null,1,2,13 March 2004
School of Rock," School of Rock: 2/10
","I think there's nothing that upsets me more than watching a classic movie that I don't like. Although I do feel just as bad after seeing a recent movie that almost everyone liked. That's how I feel about The School of Rock. One would say that this is director Richard Linklater's selling-out film (of course, this was before Before Sunset), which I guess is a good film in which to sell out, because everyone seems charmed by it. Now Linklater can get away with either art films or Hollywood films, and we can probably expect both more great films (like Sunset) and more crap (like School).Dewey (Jack Black) is kicked out of a mediocre, going nowhere rock band and hasn't paid the rent for a while. His roommate, who is a substitute teacher, receives a call to come in, but Dewey pretends to be him to get some money. He doesn't know what to do until he realizes that if he enters the fourth grade class at a prep elementary school he's teaching into a battle of the bands, he could get some money. And if you find a way to believe that plot, then I'm the king of Australia.Everything in this movie makes no sense. These rich, snotty, supposed-to-be-precocious kids (in addition to being annoying as hell) who only care about being taught don't go tell the principal that they're not being taught. They can play as well as a philharmonic (they're in fourth grade), and switching instruments is easy as pie. They want to learn in class but don't mind when their homework is to listen to a CD. And every single student-nay, every single character-is either a stereotype, underdeveloped, or obnoxious. There's the prissy, stuck up leader girl in the class, the smart yet geeky Asian, there's a homosexual student (with some of the stupidest dialogue ever written-clich√©d and stereotypical), there's the by-the-books principal (Joan Cusack). Every kid to whom they give names is underdeveloped, with no meaning. And Jack Black's character is just a fat obnoxious person. There's no reason to feel for this character. He's lazy, he's untalented, he's selfish, and an annoying person overall. Why should we care about his stupid misadventures in an elementary school? And wouldn't the teachers get at least a little suspicious when not only the teacher doesn't have ID, but the curriculum that Dewey pretends to teach varies from the theory of relativity to the basics of Christopher Columbus? And since when are there hard rock battle of the bands concerts at about noon? You're probably thinking that that's just artistic license. I'd agree with you, and I'd ignore as much of it as possible if the movie was funny. But it wasn't.Most of the jokes are lame and obvious. When asked what music they like, the kids say various teen pop artists, as would be expected by elementary schoolers. But it's stretched into this whole gag that never works. And School of Rock's supposed to make us laugh by not only seeing Black's Jim Carrey-esque facial expressions, but by the 'wackiness' of him playing an electric guitar in class. Raising hell in a classroom. That's a new topic there. Later, as the whole class goes on a field trip to register for the battle of the bands (during school, without a chaperone, and no one wonders where they went), everyone fits into Dewey's van, along with all of the equipment (that completely filled his car before). Another obvious joke is when it's said that Cusack's character gets drunk while listening to a certain song, what do you think Dewey will do? Seriously, this character is supposed to be likable and all, but he just comes off as manipulative and completely phony. School's only saving grace is me smiling a few times, but that's it. It's pretty awful what movies will be made for a quick buck. I'd rather Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 do better than The School of Rock did, just to knock this movie down a peg.My rating: 2/10Rated PG-13 for some rude humor and drug references.",2,10,27,30 July 2004
Hero," Hero: 8/10
","Oftentimes, when a movie's released, there's another movie to which it can be compared. Hero (Ying xiong) is being compared to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, simply because of the fact that they're both commercially successful foreign language martial arts films. Although I don't remember much about Crouching Tiger, I know that Hero is definitely a better movie. It has a simple yet coherent storyline that leads the audience onto a visual journey through a story told kind of like Rashomon, except this time, it's, well, interesting.Orphaned too early to be named, Nameless (Jet Li) approaches the Emperor of the Chinese province of Qin, saying that he defeated three assassins known to having desires of assassinating the Emperor. Nameless tells his story of how he pitted two against each other and killed the third. But is it the whole truth?The trailers made Hero out to be this take-names-and-kick-ass movie. While it had its share of those moments, the movie is more about telling a story with beautiful visuals and sweeping cinematography. The story's simple yet fascinating, and the way it's told is in a very unique style. It seems like you know what's going to happen, but then the plot completely changes halfway through, which doesn't disjoint you at all, which is surprising. The use of color in the film is both breathtaking and symbolic, and it's a very bright movie, which keeps interest up. The whole 'plan' (that's all I'll say about it) is interesting too, making a very interesting movie all around.Of course, the fight scenes were great, too. A lot of it (especially in the first) was done with slow-motion, which wasn't grating all, and in fact, it worked to great effect. By the way, does anyone know the name of the instrument the blind man was playing during that scene? The colors really helped with each fight scene, and the fights were fun and entertaining. Thankfully, there was no Jackie Chan-like tomfoolery with the fight scenes-almost all swordplay, and although the clacking of the swords got old, the fighting didn't. The action scenes aren't the entire movie, thankfully, so that means more of the very cool plot can take place. Li is where he belongs-the bastardized 'action' movies he's been in in America have used him under his potential. He's a good actor, not to mention a good martial arts star. Somewhat recognizable stars Maggie Cheung and Donnie Yen also were very good. Overall, Hero is an excellent martial arts movie with a good plot thrown in for an above average movie.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for stylized martial arts violence and a scene of sensuality.",Null,0,0,31 August 2004
Back to the Future Part III," Back to the Future Part III: 8/10
","To fully enjoy Back to the Future Part III, you will have had to seen and remember the first two Back to the Futures. They reference and allude to them so many times; you have to remember everything fully. Of course, the first one is the real one, so they go back to that one more often.Michael J. Fox is back for his third outing as Marty McFly, time traveler. Christopher Lloyd is Dr. Emmett Brown, mad scientist. In the first one, Doc made a time machine and Marty went to 1955 and made his parents not meet. In Part II, Marty went to 2015. Now, because Doc from 1955 went back to 1885 and he's going to get himself killed, Marty goes there. Believe me, the plot is a whole lot crazier than that. Speaking of crazy, Doc looks a lot crazier than in parts I and II.Not as good as the first, way better than the second. Fox and Lloyd are quite good, with comedic timing, real chemistry, and making sure the movie doesn't have one dull point. Also, Lloyd has superior chemistry with a teacher in the Old West, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), who comes in. Of course, because Doc wasn't supposed to be out there in the first place, it causes a paradox in the time-space continuum, meaning that what would happen in the future won't happen. You can discuss the technicalities and the plot holes/paradoxes, but really, you're not supposed to.Not really being a fan of the Old West, I wasn't really looking forward to this. However, I do like futuristic movies, I didn't really like the second one. Basically, it's a flip-flop. Many times, it looked like a stereotypical Western, with its gunslingers and its facades.Going back to the technical aspects (besides Doc saying `Great Scott!' many times), if you think closely, the three movies take place in one day. The fun of these types of movies should be put into a TV series. Most movies-to-TV-series don't work, but if they keep going to different time periods, it would be fun.There's not really much more to say, except that it's funny and extremely entertaining, a must for any casual sci-fi, adventure, western, or comedy fan.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for profanity, action violence, and sticky situations.",8,8,14,31 January 2003
Pi," Pi: 8/10
","Darren Aronofsky, I guess, could be called a film genius. Requiem for a Dream is considered to be one of the best movies of recent memory (and, from what I saw of it, I can agree), and has many of the same techniques as his previous film, Pi. Pi is one of those movies that you need to see many times in order to have everything sink in, but you don't really want to see it again. The images stick in your head, and it's a subconsciously terrifying experience.Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a mathematical genius. He analyzes numbers, and soon recognizes a pattern in the stock market. But that doesn't satisfy him. He keeps on going, as people want to use his mathematical abilities for their own selfish reasons. Max struggles with his various mental and physiological problems as he's working with this-so much that if you watch it once you can't distinguish between reality and Max's mind.Aronofsky makes this movie on parking meter money (less than $10,000), yet it's one of the most stylish movies of recent memory. Shot in black/white (there is barely any grey) with a type of vision that leaves edges to the imagination, Pi works in its own little world. With a short runtime that's shorter than Dennis Miller on one of his longwinded analogies, it works. The theories that the movie puts in your head are complete bull-honky, but they're presented in a way that you can't help believing (like many people think about Michael Moore).Well acted all around, especially by Guellette, Pi is not for everyone. There's many disturbing moments, involving brains and power tools. The second-to-last scene, just so you know, was actually done, no special effects. Overall, Pi is a very good, trippy movie that's not for everyone. But if you're game, go for it.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and some disturbing images.",8,0,1,23 May 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby: 9/10
","Million Dollar Baby is propaganda by the baby-killing liberals. As is every movie dealing with a controversial issue, especially ones made by those ultra-liberal people at Warner Bros. and that staunch Democrat Clint Eastwood. It seems like the only part of movies people talk about is the ending, even in crappy movies. Supposedly, prints of Hide and Seek were sent out without the final reel, so no one would know the ending until the time came (as if anyone cared). Remember the furor around The Sixth Sense's ending? Everyone knows it now, and if you're not careful, you'll uncover the ending to Million Dollar Baby-a true shocker, if there ever was one. It's unexpected, realistic, and powerful. Try getting that from Hide and Seek.Hilary Swank (in what is sure to be her second Best Actress Oscar role) is Maggie Fitzgerald, a trailer-park wanna-be boxer who joins up in has-been Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym. Frankie has somewhat of a misogynist attitude, but agrees to train her, anyway. She rises through the circuits of boxing very quickly, and, although reluctantly, Frankie starts to admit that she's a good boxer.Before I saw Baby, I thought for sure the Academy would finally give the best director award to Martin Scorsese for his mediocre work in The Aviator. But now, I think Eastwood's almost a shoo-in for Best Director. Eastwood frames each shot carefully, and creates the most drama possible from each one. Something that really stood out for me was his use of color. Oftentimes bleak, but always for a purpose, to elict some sort of feeling from the audience. Eastwood uses the minimum of, well, everything possible to make the mood as dreary and unwasteful as possible. And, much like Raging Bull (directed by Eastwood's current rival), the boxing scenes are completely realistic. Except you can tell Eastwood didn't cheat at all (like Scorsese probably did), as this movie is full color, and the boxing scenes build up so much tension it's almost impossible to believe. Million Dollar Baby has both that and the dramatic quality, which ranks it up with the top films of 2004.The bigger question at hand is this: whodathunk that within five years, a relatively unknown actress will have had two roles of a lifetime and win best actress in five years. Swank was amazing (although not as amazing as Chloe Sevigny, who was robbed) as Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon in Boys Don't Cry, but better here in Million Dollar Baby. Her character is so determined, such a strong spirit basically rising from nothing, and Swank portrays Maggie extremely well. I guess she'll make Annette Bening lose again this year.Is Million Dollar Baby the best picture of the year? No, mainly because in the last twenty or thirty minutes, it just drags on and on. The message and plot are clear, yet it continues to reiterate it over and over again. We know that the person wants to do something, and another person doesn't want that to happen, but seriously, do we need that extra fifteen minutes of no substance? That's the only complaint I have with this strong, strong movie. What's even better is that it's PG-13, meaning anyone can see it, which they should.My rating: 9/10 Rated PG-13 for violence, some disturbing images, thematic material and language.",9,2,3,17 February 2005
Garden State," Garden State: 9/10
","I have no idea how to start this review. I already know it's going to be hard to write, because other movies that have affected me in this way are always hard to write. Garden State hit home (not literally, although I do live close by in Philadelphia) in a way that's impossible for words. But, I'll try to say why it's such a great movie, and not exactly this year's Lost in Translation, but pretty close.Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) is a mildly successful actor in Hollywood (but not successful enough that he can quit waiting tables) who returns to the title state, his home state, when he finds out that his mom has just died. He returns for the first time in nine years and meets old friends and new ones, including Sam (Natalie Portman). He realizes how weird his family is, as he also goes on a personal journey.As I was watching Garden State, I was reminded mostly of The Royal Tenenbaums, with not only the odd occurences, but the eclectic soundtrack, which, when paired up the often beautiful images that the film creates, turns into some of the most poignant and spectacular movie scenes of recent memory. One such scene in Garden State is when Andrew, Sam, and Mark (Peter Sarsgaard) are standing the rain, screaming, as Simon and Garfunkel's 'Only Living Boy in New York' plays. It's a beautiful song, combined with a great image, which makes it all the more memorable. The movie's full of odd moments that hit you at home, with the odd cinematography, the too-real-it-can't-be-scripted dialogue (from Braff, who also directed), and the whole plot. The quirky atmosphere obviously won't appeal to everyone, but it never does.That's why it's so hard to talk about movies like this. It's quirky but not head-scratching (so it's not something like Eraserhead), and it leaves you feeling both happy and sad, and a feeling of contentment as you connect with the characters and go through what they're going through. That's the only reason Garden State doesn't get a perfect score. As the movie winds down, the quirkiness starts to go away and the movie becomes partially normal-something I normally wouldn't have minded, but since the movie played quirky, the change isn't welcomed. But other than that, this movie excels at being odd, memorable, and touching all at the same time.Braff is great in his drugged-up role. I've never watched Scrubs, so I can't judge based on his other performances, but he did a great job, nonetheless. Portman also surprised me with her complex character. It's a tough character to accurately portray. Sarsgaard, the only good part of Shattered Glass, doesn't have enough screen time for the character he was supposed to be, but he was good nonetheless.The symbolism throughout the movie is basic irony, and irony always works for me in films. Such examples are Andrew's mother dying in the bathtub and the aforementioned 'screaming the rain' scene, and the type of car that Andrew drives and the speed in which he drives it. It's small things like that that make Garden State such a good film, and one that I'm sure will be easily watchable for multiple times.My rating: 9/10Rated R for language, drug use and a scene of sexuality.",9,3,6,15 August 2004
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Drive 8/10
","In the year of the trippy movies, here's one that outdoes Memento. Mulholland Drive is a movie that knows it's weird and forces us to enjoy it and think about it, which it does.Naomi Watts is a bubbly new actress coming to Hollywood to try to make it big named Betty. However, in her aunt's apartment where she's staying, she finds Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Rita doesn't remember anything about herself, so Betty tries to help her. The less you know, the more you'll enjoy it.David Lynch shows us some seemingly unrelated scenes, one about a man killing his friend, another about a monster behind a restaurant. They all come together somehow...but how? I really had no idea, and I still don't. If you sit back and keep your eyes glued to the screen, you'll have a blast.Everything is pretty much straight forward until about 2/3 of the way through, when Rita and Betty...profess their love for each other. Then nothing is sacred and we have no idea what is happening, from a club where everything is recorded to a blue box. That blue box is the bane of my existence...someone please tell me what it's for! I've read some articles about symbolism, scroll down past the review for what I think about this movie.The actors are all good, but not as exceptional as everyone says. Justin Theroux plays a director which seems to be another totally different sideplot until the ending. Mulholland Drive is also quite funny in places, especially when Billy Ray Cyrus comes in.What else to say? Mulholland Drive isn't one you can say a lot about, except it's great, trippy, and worthwhile and something that you'll never forget.Rated R for nudity and homosexual situations.My rating: 8/10
MY TAKE ON THE MOVIE:Obviously, this is going to have SPOILERS, so don't read ahead unless you've seen the movie.BETTY/DIANE: Diane is a real person who came to Hollywood for the same reason Betty came in Diane's dream. When her jitterbug days were over, she worked at Winkie's and her life is now miserable. Her friend and lover Camilla is famous and she's jealous, which is why she's going to have Camilla killed.RITA/CAMILLA: Rita is Betty's lover and friend in Diane's dream, but the roles are sort of reversed. Since Diane is Betty, she wanted to have the spotlight instead of Camilla/Rita. Her dream is what she wanted it to be like.CLUB SILENCIO: When the M.C. says 'it is an illusion', the best I could think of is that Diane's dream is an illusion. When Rita is mumbling in Spanish, it kind of called her to the club.THE BOX: Hoo boy. The box was a portal between reality and virtual reality (so to speak). When Rita opened the box, the Cowboy work Diane up, a transport between the dream world and the real world. When Diane opens the drawer to get the gun, the box is visible, saying that death and life are two different worlds.THE COWBOY: Um...could it be that the cowboy represented everything that wasn't right in Diane's life? The cowboy made sure that Camilla starred in the movie, and the cowboy woke up Diane, taking her away from her dream that she loved, since it is everything she wanted.There you have it, I think. Of course these aren't what everybody thinks, so post your thoughts on the message board.",8,1,2,5 November 2002
8 Mile," 8 Mile: 5/10
","Basically, Eminem's acting `showcase' 8 Mile is one thing: unremarkable. Acting is unremarkable, direction, location, music, plot, all basic and nothing to write home about. About the only thing that could be said about this movie is the amount of language that was used (although it's nowhere near as much as South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut), and that's not something to brag about. The characters were all basic, no or barely any development to them, and they were just general people in Detroit.The plot is nothing new, just basically a `day in the life of' movie. We follow Jimmy Smith, Jr. (Eminem). Could screenwriter Scott Silver think of a cleverer name? His nickname is Bunny Rabbit, aka Rabbit, aka B-Rabbit, and he's a struggling rapper who has to move in with his mom Stephanie (Kim Basinger) and little sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield), while being the only white rapper out there, being that this is supposed to be semi-autobiographical. He is `discriminated' against, but he works his way up¬Ölove these deep plots in movies today!Well, what's there to talk about? I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, because there WERE none. I would have liked some development to all of the characters, since most of them were just thrown in there. Also, since everyone looked exactly the same, it was hard to tell everyone apart (well, obviously). We find out bits and pieces of Jimmy, Future (Mekhi Phifer), and Alex (Brittany Murphy), who pops up in various places. She must have used tons of hair gel to get her hair to stick out to make her look in poverty. LOOK in poverty, which isn't as good as Murphy actually acting like she was poor.Eminem's acting was like this movie was: either love-it-or-hate-it. As in the movie, I didn't love it nor hate it. He's not that great of an actor-he shouldn't quit his day job-but he's not like Charlize Theron. Basinger, after winning Best Supporting Actress in another Curtis Hanson movie (L.A. Confidential), thought she could be worthy of another one, and she tried, by God she tried, but I'm sorry, you just didn't cut it. Phifer was okay, while Murphy was stiffer than her hair was during the movie.Something that made this movie hard to believe is that it was `based' on Eminem's life. I can NOT believe this. This is not where Eminem had to live, it just seems so wrong. Also, I couldn't make sense out of that everyone was using the f- and n- word every second and had nowhere to go but still used 50-cent words. Basically, after you see 8 Mile, you won't learn anything new, your life won't be changed, you'll just have used up two hours of your life.My rating: 5/10Rated R for strong language, sexuality, some violence and drug use.",5,0,2,27 June 2003
Shrek 2," Shrek 2: 5/10
","Some movies completely stand on their own without the need of a sequel. Some don't need sequels, but do anyway, successfully, like the Toy Story movies. And some don't need sequels, but are made anyway. Shrek 2 is a combination of the first and third. Shrek was such an original, groundbreaking film, that any tweak could diminish how great the first one is. That tweak is Shrek 2, an obligatory cash-cow sequel that's so far off from everything that made the first so good that you can hardly believe it's based off the right movie.Shrek (voice of Mike Myers), who seems to have lost most of his ogre-ish edge, is now married to a transformed Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and they're summoned to Fiona's parents' castle in the land of Far Far Away. They (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) don't accept either, and the king hires Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas) to kill Shrek. Will Shrek survive? Will the king and queen look over Shrek and Fiona's differences? Will this movie try something new? I think we all know the answers to those questions.The main problem of Shrek 2 is that everyone forgets that they have a first movie that they need to live up to. Although the animation, groundbreaking in the first, was the same (how could they really improve?), the plot and the characters lack in freshness. Usually in sequels, one or two new characters need to be introduced. Here we have a half-dozen or more. And, if Shrek hadn't made any changes for Fiona, why was he not mean and ogre-like? The whole theme of the movie was to be yourself-so why wasn't Shrek throughout the movie? And Donkey's (Eddie Murphy) character seemed to decrease in personality. Instead of being constantly annoying, like he's supposed to be, all he does is sing. The worst, though, is that the writers did not find some sort of stupid way to get Lord Farquuad, one of the funniest and most interesting characters from the original, back somehow.The humor in Shrek 2 is misguided. The comedy is either crudity or satire. And the satire is just piled in heaps over us, but lots of it isn't that funny. When Shrek and Fiona first get to Far Far Away, it resembles a popular southern California city. There are parodies of stores in there, except they're all hard to see, and the ones I could see weren't funny. While crudity is often funny, here it's just people farting and belching for the most part. Instead of working parody around humor that comes naturally, the whole movie seems to be one long spoof of something or another. I guess the first one exhausted all of the fairy-tale references, so this one had to go to further depths for satire. Some were funny, but many weren't.What the movie also lacked was any true sentimentality. Although the message is more obvious, there are very few, if any, tender moments in the film. It's weird to be saying this in an animated film, but there was no connection between Shrek and Fiona. Chemistry usually makes the movie, but I couldn't sense any here. Before I'm lynched, I'd like to say that there were quite a few parts that were funny. The best was probably the addition of the Ugly Stepsister, whose voice I shall keep secret. The dinner-table scene between Shrek and the king was also pretty funny, as were a few others.Myers didn't seem to be trying here-using his lighter Fat Bastard accent again, but basically copying off what he did in the first. Diaz isn't that great of a voice actress, but it worked. Murphy didn't have as much to do, which really brought his character down. Banderas, whose Puss-in-Boots has been universally acclaimed, did a fine job with his Zorro-like character, but the character itself just wasn't funny. Ohhh, I get it! He's a cat, so he does cat-related things! Next you're going to be telling me Spider-Man shoots webs. All sarcasm aside, Cleese and Andrews did a good job, but I think the best was probably Rupert Everett as Prince Charming. The character and the voice were both great.I had been looking forward to Shrek 2 since I first heard about it. What a disappointment.My rating: 5/10Rated PG for some crude humor, a brief substance reference and some suggestive content.",5,0,0,29 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill: Volume One: 9/10
","Eleven years ago, a young man named Quentin Tarantino released his first film, Reservoir Dogs. It became a huge hit, and two years later he released Pulp Fiction. In 1997, he made his least acclaimed film, Jackie Brown. The long six year wait is over. Kill Bill: Volume One has been released into theaters with a great reception, and possible more violence than Pulp Fiction. Although I don't know much about the man, I can guess that Tarantino is not a modern Hollywood director. As he was working on Kill Bill, he didn't allow `squibs' to squirt fake blood, and he doesn't cast the most famous Hollywood stars. Knowing this, I was surprised that he allowed Miramax to split this movie up into two parts in order to get twice the revenue. Of course, if this movie hadn't been split into two, it probably would have been NC-17.Uma Thurman isn't a name that rolls off of the tongue, nor is it the first name you think of when you hear the word `actress'. That's where Tarantino's work comes in: having worked with her in Pulp Fiction, he knows her. Any mainstream actress would have not accepted, for it is `too hard of a part' to be a martial arts star. Thurman was perfect for her role as `The Bride'. She's an assassin who has been in a coma for four years, brought there by the title character, Bill (David Carradine) and others, including O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). She simply wants vengeance, for not only did they nearly kill her, but they also killed her unborn baby.Put simply, Kill Bill is the most entertaining movie of the year. It's not light and breezy, but it's never boring and really keeps a smile on your face for most of the time. Tarantino goes from quick thrills to a heavy-handed sequence in the middle of the film, but the transition is smooth, which makes it bearable. The fight scenes were amazing. Uma Thurman doesn't look like someone you would normally equate with `action star', and that's what makes her even better in her role. She plays it was fierceness and the right approach. She had the discipline to learn the complicated moves for all of her fights. They weren't wanna-be kung-fu fights like in The Matrix, but real ones. There were barely any special effects for them, and they looked spectacular.Of course, where would Tarantino be without controversy? The violence is much debated about, mainly for the cause of the two parts. Many, including me, say that the main reason that Kill Bill was split into two separate movies was to keep the MPAA rating for both as an R, instead of one NC-17 movie. The violence was gratuitous and extreme, constant throughout the movie, but it didn't seem real in the least. I've seen much of the same in the Grand Theft Auto video games. All of the blood did look real, however, and made me believe that it was actual blood.The cinematography, by Robert Richardson, is spectacular. He tries a variety of styles: quick, MTV-style cuts, long, three minutes takes, and views from every conceivable angle, and some inconceivable ones. Another factor I loved about Kill Bill was how it tried, and successfully, recaptured the cheesiness of the 70's action movies Tarantino wanted to make this movie like. Although those movies didn't shift around time like Tarantino does here, it had a low budget feel to it (like in the opening, before, and during the credits), and a plain feeling to it.There were only two things I didn't like about Kill Bill. First was how cheaply Tarantino tried to tone down the violence in a few scenes by either making the fight in black-and-white, or just having the silhouettes fight. The other was the ending. I wanted Kill Bill to go on longer, I enjoyed it so much. It left with such a cliffhanger ending, which revealed something shocking about The Bride, who, in 100 minutes and is actually a despicable person, I grew to like as a character. Other than that, if you can stomach it, go out right now to see Kill Bill.My rating: 9/10Rated R for strong bloody violence, language, and some sexual content.",9,0,0,10 October 2003
Big Fish," Big Fish: 8/10
","Weird in movies is good. There's different types of weird, but it mainly boils down to two types: Tim Burton weird and David Lynch weird. Both are pretty similar, actually, except that Burton has a reason for his weirdness, while Lynch just throws it out there. I enjoy Lynch's more, but Burton's is nice to look at, and instead of creating a puzzle that seems impossible to solve, Burton creates new worlds, stuff that can never happen but is just close enough to seem believable. In his new Big Fish, Burton likes to get as weird as he can get, but has to stay within the boundaries of mainstream movies (I'll get to that).Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is notorious for telling tall tales, which delight most people, but always seemed to annoy his son Will (Billy Crudup). He's upset because he doesn't really know much about his father. When he learns that his father is dying, he travels back to his home in Alabama, while the audience sees some of Edward's tall tales, with Ewan McGregor as the younger Ed. There, he encounters giants, werewolves, a town that seems to be taken out of something from the Twilight Zone, and a witch with a glass eye.Burton certainly is imaginative. He has some great ideas for weirdness, which are all executed extremely well. Everything comes off well, and Burton leaves us in some weird place, and we seem to just accept it. The movie thrives on leaving the audience wondering what was about what they just saw. Unlike Lynch, Burton doesn't require us to make connections; he explains it all. But that's where the one major flaw comes in. All of the weirdness is so well done that when the necessary plot developments in today's time come along, it takes away from the flow of the story, and it leaves the audience's attention waning. The story of Edward Bloom dying is not very exciting, the story of Edward Bloom's supposed past is exciting.Big Fish has a very intricate story. There's a slew of characters who seem to come in randomly, and who look/sound like others, and live in the same place as others. Instead of, just say, taking away development from someone who doesn't really matter, like Will's wife, they take away some connecting points that could help the story make sense. On the other hand, the movie did have some very funny moments, with odd dialogue thrown in to make it funnier. Danny DeVito, as a circus ringmaster with a very odd situation, comes off great, as does Steve Buscemi, who's a 'famous poet' who was part of the odd town of Spectre and goes into an unusual profession now.Everyone's been raving about how much Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney look alike, which was very fortuitous. I didn't really think they looked that similar, but that doesn't take away from the superior acting job by Albert Finney. He not only got into his role, but seemed like he had a fun time doing it. However, he's the only one who really stands out; everyone else just 'acts', nothing more, nothing less. The score, by longtime Burton partner Danny Elfman, is barely noticeable. If there was any music in it at all, I didn't notice it.I would like to see Big Fish again for one thing. Burton seems to be a director who has fun with his movies. He references a lot of his other movies in his movies. I caught a reference to Edward Scissorhands, but all others eluded me. Overall, Big Fish is a fun movie with some very weird qualities, but some qualities that aren't particularly great.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for a fight scene, some images of nudity and a suggestive reference.",8,0,0,7 February 2004
The Graduate," The Graduate: 9/10
","In Dustin Hoffman's first starring role, as Ben Braddock, he's just out of college and 21. He has no idea what to do with his life. So he decides to go with his parents' friend's idea to have an affair with her. She's Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). That's fine, it brings some excitement to his life. But Ben had no idea that he'd also be involved with her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross).The Graduate has great acting, great and original plot, and great music. The music, by Simon and Garfunkle, is classic (who can't sing along to Mrs. Robinson whenever it's played?). It really brings out the somber mood of the piece which is portrayed so well.The script, though taken from a novel, seems so original and striking that it seems to be thought up at the moment. It actually didn't seem to have a script. It seemed like real life and that Hoffman was actually Ben. A script that could have deftly placed humor along with touching and powerful moments with moments that we can classify with is a force to be reckoned with. We really feel for all of the characters; so well written.Hoffman was completely perfect. His naivetivity and contentness with the world around him made Hoffman seem like he wasn't acting. Wow. Anne Bancroft is also very good, and so is Katharine Ross. All of the supporting characters were very well played, also.With The Graduate's 35th birthday here, it's fitting that I say that it seems to not be 'old'. It could have been released today and I would not have been able to tell the difference. Its subject matter and it's powerful message is one that will stick with you for a long, long time to come!My rating: 9/10Rated PG for sexual situations and language.",9,0,1,1 December 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: 9/10
","Now this is truly amazing. Writer Charlie Kaufman wrote a comedy that I didn't find overrated. Although I really liked Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, his one straight drama, Being John Malkovich had no place to go and Adaptation. had something missing to it. But Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a genius creation. Not only is it his funniest movie, but it's also the most coherent and most enjoyable movie.Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Director Michel Gondry (who worked previously with Kaufman on Human Nature) found a way to not only have the movie make sense, but to have some striking visuals (barely any, if any, that were done by computer fx) thrown in, also. For the most part, we see what is going on in Joel's mind as Clementine is being erased, so it's always interesting to see what will happen. The story, although a certain subplot seemed unnecessary, flowed together nicely, and, although told out of sequence, made perfect sense. That made no sense, but you'll understand it if you see the movie.I wouldn't say Carrey put his most subtle work here (that honor goes to The Truman Show), but he did do a good job, and, as I have heard, is a VERY early Oscar contender for next year. That I doubt, but it will be interesting to watch. Winslet (who has faded from her Titanic stardom) is also quite good. However, the supporting cast, including Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Tom Wilkinson, leave something to be desired. They don't seem to really want to be in this movie as much as the others do.Overall, Eternal Sunshine is a surprising film. It's surprisingly funny, surprisingly entertaining, surprisingly dramatic, and, most of all, surprisingly easy to follow.My rating: 9/10Rated R for language and some drug and sexual content.",9,1,3,19 March 2004
This Is Spinal Tap," This is Spinal Tap: 7/10
","In this rockumentary, Rob Reiner (who also directs) plays Marty Di Bergi, a filmmaker. He's taping the day to day life of the aging rock group Spinal Tap.The three members that we actually learn and care about are David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean, lead guitar and vocals), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest, lead guitar and vocals) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer, bass and vocals). Hey, that name works, since we barely get to see Derek at all, and his part is so small.Spinal Tap, in most parts, is funny, with the band overreacting to small sandwiches to a three foot high Stonehenge. It is hard, however, to understand or hear all of them since they use British accents and there are no subtitles on the DVD. They did put too many characters in, since I do not know how Fran Dresher got into it or anything.The movie must be the shortest musical ever created, clocking in at 83 minutes. Even so, it stretches the premise out for way too long and would have been better as a half hour or even an hour TV special.There were a fair number of jokes, as I've said before, but they don't 'crack you up', they just hit you and you give a short laugh. Spinal Tap is entertaining, and all of the main actors are good. Reiner (who also co-scripted with the three leads) seemed to not know he was acting, but his part wasn't very demanding. The wigged band members (who did all their own singing) played their part like they were Spinal Tap. Michael McKean is one of my favorites, and Harry Shearer is from my favorite TV show, The Simpsons.This is Spinal Tap is a usually funny and entertaining but too stretched out comedy that can get your toes a'tapping and your mouth a'smiling.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.",7,2,7,24 November 2002
There's Something About Mary," There's Something About Mary: 6/10
","Why is it that bad taste and offensive material is acceptable if there are some morals thrown in? People rarely question this, as it's especially true in movies made by the Farrelly brothers, known for their bad taste in such movies as Dumb and Dumber. If people laugh, they forget that what they're laughing at is offensive. And while there is a little bit of clean humor in There's Something About Mary, it's few and far between as jokes involving at least three bodily functions are shown, mentally retarded people are ridiculed (but not as much as you may think), and fake dogs are injured (but not killed). It's another day in the life of a Farrelly brother.Ted (Ben Stiller), as a somewhat nerdy high schooler in the 80s, is going to the prom with popular girl Mary (Cameron Diaz), but an unfortunate accident has Ted going to the hospital. Thirteen years later, Ted still hasn't gotten over Mary, so he hires private investigator Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) to find out about her. Pat discovers that there's 'something about Mary' and falls in love with her. Ted now has to go to Florida to stop Pat, but gets into a lot of zany mishaps along the way.Mary works, but in moderation. It seems like the only time it goes for the full comedic effect and works is during the truly inspired scenes. The bathroom scene in the beginning is great-that, and the first 'dog/speed' scene are the only two that had me cracking up for the whole scene. The rest of the movie had a laugh or two, but not really that much. The 'hair gel' part seemed to over-the-top to be even remotely believable. There's some good characters, like Magda (Lin Shaye) and Dom (Chris Elliot) that have their moments, but none of them even stand out. Diaz does what she does, playing a level-headed, all-around nice person, and Stiller playing his slightly-nebbish person perfectly, but it's either that or some weird over-the-top guy (like Zoolander or Dodgeball).The romantic parts of the movie worked for what they were meant to do, which was further the humor. I suppose I bought the relationship between Stiller and Diaz, although Dillon's over-the-top character was more realistic in his fascination with Mary. But, since Dillon wasn't in either of the aforementioned scenes, he didn't evoke many laughs. Mary's 2 hour runtime went by pretty quickly, and I suppose when you have a runtime like that, being entertaining is more important than being funny, and that's obviously the case with Mary, although it's not its intention.My rating: 6/10Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language.",6,0,1,20 August 2004
National Treasure," National Treasure: 7/10
","Dontcha just hate Jerry Bruckheimer? I mean, Pearl Harbor sucked (and I miss you), and all of his movies are basically the same. It's a bunch of explosions, some stock characters, and a cheesy romance thrown in. National Treasure is no different. Then what sets this apart from all of Bruckheimer's other movies? The movie knows its absurd, knows its implausible and ultimately stupid, meaning that it can throw any reason out the window and alloy for some silly fun to overrule the movie. I can't regard anyone who calls this movie great as someone serious, but I also can't really see how someone could wave off this movie as being too light-hearted and can't enjoy the film for being the silly stupidity that it is.Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage) descends from a long line of treasure hunters, looking for a treasure supposedly buried by the founding fathers. Generations before him have also looked, but to no avail. However, Ben, along with his wisecracking sidekicks/computer nerd Riley (Justin Bartha), find clues, while competing treasure hunter Ian (Sean Bean) follows close behind. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger of Troy and Wicker Park fame), as some sort of historical government official, comes along for the ride.As this is a Bruckheimer movie, I was expecting many forays into deep, dark tunnels with magical effects that almost (but don't) kill the main characters. Thankfully, that's only at the end; the majority of the movie's about stealing a priceless historical document. What could be cooler, really? If you think about it, it's completely against what we're supposed to be feeling, yet this all-American person decides to steal what's the backbone of our society for his own personal good. I mean, that's cool. The movie introduces many things that have no explanation (Benjamin Franklin's glasses, perchance?), have no reason why they could work, much like many other action/adventure movies. But, really, why care? The movie's entertaining. The action's there, the suspension of disbelief is there, and the fun's there.I'm not a huge Nicolas Cage fan (but I don't really detest him like some do), but he's fine here. I mean, he's not a tremendous actor, but you could do worse. Bean and Kruger (both, actually, were in Troy-you could do six degrees of Troy easily) were as expected. Bean usually plays the 'conniving evil British dude' in movies like these, and Kruger is at least making a mainstream name for herself. Bartha could quite possibly be the next guy who, when you see him in a movie, say 'I KNOW that guy, I just don't know what else I saw him in.' But, the acting's not important, what's important is that National Treasure is a fun movie. It has the stamp of Bruckheimer all over it, but don't let that fool you.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for action violence and some scary images.",7,1,2,3 December 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Reservoir Dogs: 8/10
","It's safe to say Quentin Tarantino is the master of the crime genre. With only four movies directed, though, it seems a little presumputuous to say that. And having seen three of the four, I don't really seem to be in a position to say that. However, when one of those movies is a masterpiece, another is a stunningly entertaining work, and the third an impressive debut piece, it's hard to say anything but that. He directs his films with such a loving eye towards the genre that it's easy to see what he wants you to get out of it: a good time. And that is what he accomplishes.Six men are brought together to perform a heist. They are Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Brown (Tarantino), and Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker). They're all hired by Joe (Lawrence Tierney) and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) to steal some diamonds. Things get out of hand, as it turns into a massacre and one of the thieves is a rat.Reservoir Dogs has a different feel to it than Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill did. I suppose that those two movies were fun to watch. Dogs wasn't really fun to watch. It was interesting and all, but I didn't really have a good time while doing so. It does pick up the pace as it goes through its short runtime, thankfully, with more flashbacks and all. There is barely any music in the film, which is what made it seem longer, and music was key to Pulp Fiction. And the violence wasn't over the top like Kill Bill, which was the essence to that movie. Then again, it was Tarantino's first film.That's not to say that Reservoir Dogs wasn't entertaining, it just wasn't enthralling in the same way those other two movies were. Dogs had interesting characters who wound up in a strange situation, and much like Pulp it's a talking heads movie. The dialogue is interesting and profanity-laden, which adds to the uniqueness of the movie. Like those other two movies, too, Tarantino puts in titlecards for the flashbacks, which help, I suppose. Dogs is a hard movie to write a review for. There's a lot going for it, but it just wasn't fun to watch.Many of the actors here came back to do other Tarantino work. Keitel, who plays a pretty level-headed guy here, plays Winston Wolfe in Pulp; Roth, who doesn't have to do that much for most of the movie, was Pumpkin in Pulp; Buscemi, who does a great job as the terminally interesting and entertaining Mr. Pink, was the waiter in Pulp; Madsen, who plays my favorite Dog, Blonde, because of his gleeful derangement, is Budd in Kill Bill. All add to the movie as a whole. Reservoir Dogs is an interesting movie, and I know that it will continually get better on repeat viewings.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong violence and language.",Null,1,3,18 February 2004
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction: 9/10
","Controversy is usually good for movies. It's helped push movies to box office success just to see how bad they actually were, and I think that that is one of the ways Pulp Fiction has become so immensely popular. I've heard multiple people musing about the excessive violence, the drug use, the language, and more. So I really wanted to see Pulp Fiction beforehand, but curiosity piqued my interest. I have to say that all of the hype didn't really add anything. It wasn't very violent (or it could be that I'm just desensitized to violence, but besides one scene, I've seen worse on TV), the language just seemed to flow normally (or maybe it was because I had seen Bad Santa the day before and it had about the same concentration of language), and the drug use¬Öwell, I expected it for it is a movie about drug abusers.Pulp Fiction is less a complete movie than a series of interrelated stories, the most interesting of which is Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) as two gangsters who often have pointless conversations. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is a boxer who accidentally kills his opponent in the ring and then he realizes the thrill of killing people. Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) pays Butch to throw that fight, but when he kills the guy, Marcellus gets Jules and Vincent to whack him. Along the way, Vincent has to take Marcellus's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out, and along the way she OD's. Got all that?There is one thing that Tarantino can do that no one else I've seen can do efficiently. He can work with time so well that you don't even notice it. Christopher Nolan first tried it in Following, unsuccessfully, and then executed well in Memento. However, there, he held our hand throw it, while Tarantino just lets it rip and hopes we can figure it out for ourselves, which we can do. That adds to the already thick layer of coolness that is in Pulp Fiction. Each character is memorable, especially Jules, who quotes from the Bible right before killing someone. It's just a very hip experience.Pulp Fiction cheerfully takes clich√©s, chews them up, and spits them out in a whole new vein. Like what Kill Bill did in the beginning, with the retro opening to set the mood, Pulp Fiction is halfway between an homage to gangster films and parody. Also, it's a trendsetter. The classic dance scene between Vincent and Mia at Jack Rabbit Slim's (which is a parody of all of those stupid throwback restaurants) has been parodied itself, as has the scene where Vincent and Jules are talking about McDonalds' Quarter Pounders.In addition to the layer of coolness, Pulp Fiction also has a lot of humor in it, much of it at times when you know you shouldn't laugh but you do, and also out of situations that you wouldn't laugh at usually. I'm sure some of the parts I laughed at were just because I wasn't expecting something to happen, or maybe I just have a morbid mind, but a lot of the humor came out of the violence.Everyone in the cast had amazing chemistry with each other, which added believability to a somewhat unbelievable story. The only reason that Pulp Fiction did not get a perfect score is that one scene with Butch and a cab driver went on for too long and did little to service the plot. Knowing me, though, I'll soon change the rating, but it can still be said that Pulp Fiction is one of the most influential movies of the 1990's.My rating: 9/10Rated R for strong graphic violence and drug use, pervasive strong language and some sexuality.",9,2,5,2 December 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Reloaded: 6/10
","Stop the presses! Keanu Reeves has set a new record for himself-he actually goes through an entire movie without saying the word `whoa'. That is what you'll be saying throughout the movie, although the non-extreme scenes will leave you confused and bored.Neo, our hero from The Matrix, is back again, along with Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar floating through the real world (to understand what I'm saying, check out my Matrix review). This time, he somehow has to save the last human city of Zion before the machines destroy it. Also, he's in love with Trinity. Follow that?Put simply, The Matrix Reloaded is X2 for an older crowd. They're both sequels made just for money from a movie that may have been original and grossed in between $100 and $200 million. They both offer more action, often ridiculous, have more convoluted plots, and include more and unnecessary characters. But it isn't all bad.This is a special FX movie, and you can't expect anything more. There are some great fight scenes, with awesome moves. As filmcritic.com's Christopher Null states, `This is a movie about kicking ass.' And there is a lot of that going on. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) clones himself, causing Neo to fight thousands of the same person. The opening credits were neat, but were worthless since the only thing it said was `The Matrix Reloaded'.On the flip side, there isn't really any meaning to it all. Characters come and go, like the albino twins who can transport, or that guy who cuts his own hands. Also, many points seemed to be like `Rocky and Bullwinkle', when luck-of-the-draw things happen. Although this movie played out `fate', it just seemed like everything `just happened'. I didn't really like the whole destiny, cause-and-effect thing, it just didn't work.Reeves, as Neo, does his usual one-note `tough-action guy' persona which he's had ever since the Bill and Ted movies. Face it, Keanu, you aren't that good of an actor. Laurence Fishburn, as Morpheus, is good at these types of roles. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, is one of my favorite actresses, and I've been waiting for her to be nude in a movie since 2000's Memento, and I heard that she was in this movie, but I was misled. Weaving is definitely typecast as Agent Smith.The Wachowski Brothers, the directors and writers, decide to change the many action scenes. Martial arts can be enjoyable and funny (hey, even `I know kung-fu' was funny in the first one), as evidenced in Jackie Chan movies, but here they overdo it. Most of the fight scenes didn't impress me; it was just the same OVER and OVER again. They also looked obvious. It was shot individually-Keanu with one, Hugo in others, and just spliced together. $100+ million budget? Didn't look like it. It's basically a clich√É¬© or parody of what the first one was.It all boils down to this: if you loved the first one, you'll love this one. If you liked the first one, you'll think this one is OK.My rating: 6/10Rated R for sci-fi violence and some sexuality.",6,0,0,17 May 2003
Mystic River," Mystic River: 8/10
","In many ways, I didn't want to like Mystic River. I'm always wary when movies receive universal praise, and, although I wanted to see it, I actually hoped that I would be going against everyone. That wasn't the case (although it was with Blood Work, Clint Eastwood's previous movie: I loved it while everyone else didn't) here: I loved it as much as the next critic. I say this often, but Mystic River deserves acting Oscars. Eastwood's one fatal mistake was to not release this movie in December, when people would remember its acting. Now it will be lucky if it gets one nomination for acting.One day, three friends are playing in a street when one is abducted. He escapes four days later. Twenty five years later, all three friends are reunited. Jimmy's (Sean Penn) daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is murdered. Dave (Tim Robbins), who was the abducted child, who still lives in the town, becomes closer to Jimmy, and Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a cop investigating the case. It's more than just a murder mystery, it's a deep character study into the lives of three broken men.If you walk out of Mystic River hating the movie, you cannot deny that it had a cast whose acting prowess alone was worthy, and the performances the actors put in make the movie one of the best with the ensemble of actors. Each actor puts out an outstanding job, each better than the next. If I had to pick one person who did the best job, I would have to pick Robbins. His performance was so powerful and believable as a broken man. Next would have to be Laurence Fishburne as a police officer, maybe because I'm glad to see him in something other than The Matrix; he deserves better than that.Mystic River is one of those movies that are hard to put into words without sounding clich√É¬©d, but I'll attempt to anyway. I could call it powerful, which it is, but everyone else has said that because they too are at a loss of words. It's really an experience you have to see to understand. The mystery of the whole movie (who the murderer was) was done very well; I'm not sure who contributed to it more, Eastwood or screenwriter Brian Helgeland, but it was seemed that every person in the town could have committed the murder. That's a pretty good trick.There are four things that really made this remarkable movie a little less. First was how much Robbins and Penn looked alike (to me), so it was hard to tell them apart. Many characters were underdeveloped, such as the Savage brothers, and since they were crucial to the plot, it didn't really work. It seems like there were a few scenes taken out, especially about the Mystic River, which is only referred to once or twice. Maybe there's more references in the book. Lastly, and most importantly, when the killer was revealed at the end, it was done in such a nonchalant way it doesn't sink in and have the impact it should. If you can overlook those few things, then chances are you'll love Mystic River.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language and violence.",8,0,0,20 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind: 8/10
","At the 2001 Academy Awards, A Beautiful Mind got four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Screenplay from Another Medium. It well deserved all of them.Russell Crowe is John Forbes Nash. He's an acclaimed mathematician. He reluctantly teaches a class at Princeton, where he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). It doesn't take a genius to know that they get married. However, what Alicia, and John, don't know is that John is a schizophrenic. His life soon turns to shambles as he tries to piece together what's real in his life and what's not.It could only be Ron Howard who could make this believable. Of course, the story of John Nash is unbelievable, but it could be played with such unnatural pathos, making the story too silly to be likeable. Howard, however, could turn this into a compelling drama that you'll enjoy sitting through. The over-two-hour runtime seems to fly by. A Beautiful Mind has about everything a drama needs: palpable drama, romance, a few tense scenes, and even a little humor. Not much, but a little.The slow camera movements added to the general creepiness. Such as the clich√É¬©d use of little girls with big eyes to add tension, the creeping camera brought out the feel of the picture that is very tangible. If you just take an ordinary `drama', you can't connect to any of the characters. Howard, along with screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, made Nash a likeable character, even from his asocial and agoraphobic tendencies from the beginning of the film.James Horner created great music for this film. It's actually a soundtrack that I'm thinking of purchasing; he got robbed at the Oscars.Goldsman's script was so masterfully written. It seems like he could become an object to behold soon in the future. It seemed, however, like he wanted each line to be a memorable one that everyone in the future would remember. Although some of them may be, it was a turn off (but one of the few from the film). I think that Howard and Goldsman can become a worthy team soon on.Crowe did a better job here than in other movies, such as Gladiator. His genuine fear was very well displayed, though I don't think he got cheated at the Oscars. Connelly (who looked a lot like Andie McDowell to me) was also quite good, but, personally, didn't deserve her Oscar. Ed Harris, I think, did the best performance in the film as an FBI man, William Parcher. I could really feel for these characters, they did an excellent job as a whole.There's not much more to say, it was a great movie that everyone should see.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material, sexual content and a scene of violence.",8,0,2,1 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: 7/10
","In the sequel that surpasses the original, Daniel Radcliffe again plays our bespecaled hero, Harry Potter. He's now a second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but his aunt and uncle (Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw), with whom he lives with, aren't exactly keen on his 'talents'. Dobby, a house-elf, comes into Harry's room and tells him not to go back to school, because bad things will befall him. Harry, of course, doesn't heed the warning.His aunt and uncle won't allow him to go back, but his faithful friend Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) comes to rescue him by a flying car! So Harry goes to school after all. But it looks like Dobby was right, because soon after sessions begin, students are becoming Petrified (why not?). To the common eye, it looks like Harry's arch-enemy Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).This Potter out-magics the original one. It doesn't waste time on 'trivial' aspects such as character developement. To someone who hasn't read the books or seen the first movie, it would be confusing with all the magical lingo and the characters who they do nothing to improve upon. Neville Longbottom gets into more fiascos, Draco becomes more meanicing, but that's about it. No word about Seamus Finnegan. We don't know that Dean Thomas exists, but they can't make a 161-minute much longer, can they?Radcliffe is OK as Harry, but I don't really understand people saying he's the next Haley Joel Osment. He's fine for these 'physically demanding' roles but for a serious part? Nuh uh. Grint, as Ron, horribly overacts. We understand that he's Chuckie to Radcliffe's Tommy (a Rugrats analogy), but come on! Grint is just a little too excited to play a part in a movie. Hermione Granger, a know-it-all, is played well by Emma Watson-gotta see some of the school plays she's been in!Hogwarts has a new teacher for the Defense Against the Dark Arts class-Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), Order of Merlin, Fourth Class, Five-Time Winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming Smile Award. He's egotistical, as I'm sure you couldn't guess. Branagh performs the best acting of the movie, except it would have been better if, like the book, he had had a larger role. He coulda been a contender.Richard Harris, as aged Headmaster Dumbledore, is pretty good; unfortunately, he sounds more sickly than the first. Maggie Smith, Professor McGonagall, was pretty good for her small role. All of the other teachers, such as cold Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) were acceptable, however small their parts.Most of my complaints are also complaints for the book, also, such as all the minor characters. However, if Chris Columbus had not tried to be so faithful to the book it would have helped. Obviously it couldn't be perfectly true to the book, but when Justin Flinch-Fletchy got Petrified, for instance, the movie watching audience had no idea who it was. In the book they at least get some more insight. Many of the speeches, such as Dumbledore's at the end, as almost word-for-word from the book (I had just re-read the book before). Not that it isn't inspiriational, but it's perfectly adapted.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is very good. However, the trouble with Harry (sorry...just had to!) is it's too faithful and some poor acting.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for scary moments, some creature violence and mild language.",7,0,0,29 November 2002
Psycho," Psycho: 10/10
","Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie is only forty-three years old, yet it rings fear into the hearts of millions of people, each scream louder than the next. What movie is this? Why, Psycho, of course.It begins with a swift opening credit sequence that is low-tech but does the job. Just like the rest of the movie. This, along with other Hitchcock films, is what horror movies are. You don't need excessive blood and gore and amorous teenagers. All you need is a decent story and tension galore.Actually, this landmark films is pretty much thrill-free for the first half. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary. She is asked to take $40,000 to the bank, but instead she runs away with it, without telling anybody. She then decides to check into the Bates Motel and chats a bit with loner owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She then takes a shower¬Ö.Everybody knows the plot, everyone knows the shower scene. What most people also know is how great this film is. It's finely crafted with superior music and terrific acting all around, with some symbolism all around. First, the music.Bernard Herrmann, who produced the score for most of Hitch's other movies, did a top-notch job here, also. His strings orchestra really brought out the noir-ish mood. Even when Marion is just driving, you still feel tense because of his A+ score. The superimposed voice-overs that weren't very frequent were also quite good; it seemed like you couldn't tell whether Marion was thinking that or not. Hitchcock is a great directory; his camera shots and precise timing are superb. Most horror filmmakers try to carbon copy his style, but never succeed, because they don't have any of his wit and superiority. This is a fine craftsman at work.Perkins is eerily great. He manages to be vague and yet vulnerable. He's being overpowered by his overbearing mother who lives in the house behind the motel. He seems like he could be a nice guy¬Öuntil he snaps. Leigh is also great, along with Vera Miles (Marion's sister Lila), John Gavin (Marion's boyfriend Sam), and Martin Balsam (P.I. Arborgast).I don't understand why Psycho was remade thirty eight years after it came out. Nobody needed to see it in color, with new actors, and the same scene-by-scene! It probably would have been a lot better if Gus Van Sant (who directed the new one) did a `reimagining', like Tim Burton and Planet of the Apes. Sure, William H. Macy is in the new one, but I've seen some of it and it's just horrible.Reading up online, I see some symbolism throughout the movie. Norman's obsession with birds (his middle name is Francis in the movie) means he wants to fly away from his mother. Something that I always love in movie is when they put `hints' of the movie in. For example, in the office where Marion works, there are two pictures: one of where she will be pulled over by a cop and one of a swamp that comes into play later. That type of stuff I always find fascinating.Look for Hitchcock's cameo (like he always has) as a man in a cowboy hat around four minutes into the movie, outside of Marion's office.My rating: 10/10Rated R for two scenes of violence.",10,0,0,19 January 2003
Man on Fire," Man on Fire: 3/10
","Is it just me, or can action movies never be set in America anymore? They all either take place overseas, or the main character at least travels there. In Man on Fire, Tony Scott's attempt to be cool, it mostly takes place in Mexico City to prove to the dimwitted public that, yes, America is better than any other country. To prove to everyone how good America is, Scott has actors who speak with American accents who have lived all their lives in Mexico. People with southern accents don't trust Americans because they're 'foreign'. It's even worse when the actors attempt to put on a decent accent, and by even worse, I mean laughably bad.John Creasy (Denzel Washington, in a one-note role) is a former assassin who has become an alcoholic. He is hired by a Mexican family (or an American family with southern accents) to protect their young child, Pita (the ubiquitous Dakota Fanning) from the recent onslaught of kidnappings. About halfway through the movie (where it could have stopped and been a mediocre drama), she is kidnapped. Creasy swears vengeance on everyone who helped kidnap her. You know, these revenge movies always stay fresh and never get old after a while.My largest complaint was the directing by Scott. Neither of the Scott brothers (the other being Ridley) are very high on my list, and Man on Fire just backs up my statement. Scott tries to be all 'hip' and 'turn of the century' by not keeping the camera still for even one frame. Even when two people are talking, the camera's continuously moving in circles. It's enough to make you sick. If that's not bad enough, Scott plays tricks with the camera related to focusing so oftentimes you can never tell what's happening, which is not helped by the choppy editing. Perhaps some of the minimal action could have been considered exciting if we were able to tell what the hell was going on at any time.Enough about the technical aspect of the movie, which was bad enough. The movie, touted as a no-holds-barred action movie, does have holds barred (whatever that may mean) and is not able to be called an action movie, simply because there is no action. There is nothing going on for the first half of the movie (which I have said before) except for a brief montage of how bad Mexico City is for kidnapping (which is only referred to once more, and it's impossible to tell what is happening then, also). The first half explored the bonding relationship between Pita and Creasy, which is supposed to explain why Creasy would be so hell-bent on destroying everyone who kidnapped Pita. However, there is no chemistry between the two, and the basis of their relationship doesn't even make sense. Pita's mother tells him that Pita wants to be friends with him, so this hard-as-nails ex-Marine decides to be friends with her. If he were TRULY a tough nail, he wouldn't have given in. So why did he do it? To further the 'plot', of course! The main thing is, though, that the character of Pita is just too damn annoying to care about. Fanning had just come off of her star-making role in The Cat in the Hat, and here again she plays the precocious child who is amazing at everything she does. This is supposedly a true story, and if this was just supposed to be an ordinary family torn apart by the kidnapping, why would this child be an expert at swimming, playing piano, extreme ease of talking to adults, and, most of all, being so annoying? The world may never know.Once the second half of the movie starts up and Creasy begins to get mad, every single plot development that could have slowly happened in the first half comes in. It's a leisurely movie, and then BOOM plot here, here, and here. Add a few random acts of off-screen violence and you get what naive critics call a 'non-stop' action movie that's so violent it should be banned. Give me a break. If this was truly an action movie, wouldn't action take place throughout, and, more importantly, wouldn't it be exciting? That's the aspect that's most needed in Man on Fire but is not used-whatever action there is is not exciting. The acts of torture are a little out of the ordinary, but are not used properly or done in a way that makes sense (re: the man tied to the car). In closing, if you want to see a young precocious kid acting annoying and a famous actor sleepwalking through a boring, meaningless movie with no action, then Man on Fire is your best bet.My rating: 3/10Rated R for language and strong violence.",3,2,12,1 May 2004
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest: 7/10
","Randle Patrick McMurphy is committed to a mental institution, when he thinks he doesn't need to be there. He causes havoc on the place, but especially on the head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Some of the people he lives with is Harding (William Redfield), Martini (Danny DeVito), Sefelt (William Duell), Bancini (Josip Elic), Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd).I really had no idea what to rate this movie: it's dramatic but not too dramatic, it's funny but not too funny. I felt inspired, but I had many complaints about it. First off, I felt like it didn't have a central plot. IMDb.com says: `A man sent to a mental hospital finds the head nurse a lot more dangerous than the other patients.' I agree, but we really have no connection between the two. Besides a few arguments, we have nothing to back that up. If it was concentrated more on that than on unnecessary sidetrips, such as when Randle took everyone on a field trip fishing. I see that that shows how he's connecting and how crazy he's becoming, but if it had been removed so more of the initial plot could come underway, it would have helped.Even without music for a lot of the time, I felt like I was being touched by this movie, mainly at the end. However, it doesn't have a central message or theme. It was heart wrenching at times, even over the littlest things, but for a lot of the time it was just `a movie'. I don't want you to think the wrong thing, I enjoyed and liked this movie.Nicholson, who is McMurphy, was excellent yet again. Fletcher was good, but would have been better if she was in more scenes, considering she's the second largest star of the film. She, as Ratched, wanted routine and routine only. I didn't really think she was `dangerous', but if it had been a longer movie, it could have worked. I thought that all of the mental patients were great, especially Lloyd (it was his debut, as was DeVito's).I did notice a few things that I didn't think would happen in real life. First, I wouldn't think that they would allow smoking in a hospital. Also, I noticed that throughout the entire movie, McMurphy didn't have the hospital gowns that everyone else had. Other than that, I would have to say that this movie is very good, but many flaws.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language, violence, and mental themes.",7,1,2,30 March 2003
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Anchorman: 7/10
","I have mixed feelings about Will Ferrell. I think he's a very funny guy and a great improviser, but I still can't let bygones be bygones and forgive him for making Old School. Although I didn't get around to seeing Elf, I think that Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is the movie to make Ferrell a comedy star or not. If his name alone can fill theaters, I think he'll be hot property for studios in the future. The trailers for Anchorman made it look promising. I had watched the trailer many times and kept on laughing. I had hoped that all of the best parts weren't given away in the trailers, and much to my surprise, most of the material in the trailer wasn't even included in the final movie, which I guess was both a blessing and a curse. It showed that there was even more riotous material than was in the trailer, but it also meant that some of the great stuff from the trailer couldn't be in the movie.Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is a macho, chauvinistic, popular news anchorman in San Diego in the 1970s. He and his news team, which consists of field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), sports anchor Champ Kind (David Koechner) and low IQed Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), are the number one news team in town. However, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) joins the news team and threatens the masculinity of the station, but also it threatens Ron's job. Ron and his news team try to do whatever they can to stop Veronica from becoming the first female anchor, while still trying to get in bed with her.The whole premise seems like it's some sort of Saturday Night Live sketch stretched into a movie (almost like a Weekend Update movie-now that would be awesome), especially since Ferrell, an SNL alum, co-wrote the movie. But it's just a silly, funny, stupid movie that has little plot and relies chiefly on Ferrell's improvisation. He's a great improviser, and it shows, because it often takes center stage, taking it from where it belongs: Steve Carrell. Playing the dimwitted Brick, he has some great lines and actions. He says my favorite line in the whole movie. I won't spoil it here, but it's in an argument with a rival station (led by Vince Vaughn). That brings me to another point. It seems like they don't even try to stay coherent (like the stylings of The Naked Gun and those types of movies). It's that type of comedic styling that's always the funniest.The laughs seemed to be coming in at a pretty steady pace, but the main problem is that this low-brow humor didn't warrant that large of laughs. They were regular, but they weren't that large. You can't expect perfection, but when you have so much material, I would think you'd try to find the best of the best. Maybe when this movie is released onto DVD there will actually be good deleted scenes. Whenever there's a movie with so much material to use, they always bring it down to about 90 minutes. Couldn't they bring it up another half hour? It'd work, I think. But anyway, Anchorman is a great, leading-role making performance by Will Ferrell, and enough consistent laughs to satisfy most people. Just beware that whenever Ferrell's name is on a poster, it usually equates to stupid humor. But there's nothing wrong with that, is there?My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for sexual humor, language and comic violence.",7,1,2,10 July 2004
Ray," Ray: 10/10
","Ray Charles was one of those performers who always seemed joyful. Whenever he performed one of his songs, his jovial qualities seemed to pass onto you, and you felt great. Of course, on the inside, Charles was dealing with his own inner demons, as shown in Ray. Approved by Charles himself before he died, the movie shows both side of Charles-the good and the bad. The film doesn't go as far as to glamorize Charles, nor does it make him out to be some sort of beast. He's just stuck in the middle, which is the way most people are.Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) grows up in the poor south. He lives with his single mother (Sharon Warren) and his younger brother, who goes through a traumatic death. Ray soon becomes blind, and learns the piano. His career slowly takes off, and then zooms to popularity. Along for the ride is his wife (Kerry Washington), who goes through his heroin addiction and his womanizing on the road.The reason why I gave Ray such a high rating, you ask? Simply because there's not one thing wrong with it. The writing, directing, acting, cinematography, music, editing-everything is perfect in the best movie of the year so far. First, the directing. Taylor Hackford, known for such movies as Dolores Claireborn and The Devil's Advocate, directs the movie in a unique style. He has flashbacks to Charles's childhood early and often, and instead of having them be disjointed and unnecessary, Hackford creates it perfectly, timing everything perfectly so it all flows together in a meaningful way. The movie, despite its long runtime, doesn't meander at all, thanks to Hackford's direction. The way each shot was created, the seeming perfectionist way it was done, leads Ray to have some of the best direction in recent years.Written by Hackford and James L. White, it seems like the movie is based off of something that was quite detailed, that the two had to whittle down a lot of Charles's life just to get it in the two-and-a-half hour zone for a movie. Yet the movie was never, ever boring. The 150 minutes flew by quickly, and my butt wasn't even in pain. That's the sign of an involving, intimate movie. Where you can watch it for as long as it goes on, lose all sense of time, and get wrapped up in whatever's going on. And, since Hackford co-wrote the movie, he knows what he can and can't do with the script. The writing and directing really go hand in hand here.Jamie Foxx, who, before I saw Ray, put in the best acting job of the year as Max in Collateral, puts in the best acting job of the year here. Foxx does such a good job that everyone forgot that it wasn't actually Ray Charles being himself. All of the imitations of Charles were dead-on. Foxx had to go through a grueling breakdown by Charles, and Foxx was actually blinded for most of the shoot. It's this method acting that really makes Foxx Charles. Washington, who 'broke out', so to speak, in Spike Lee's She Hate Me, does a great job here, also, although her performance is a little overshadowed by Foxx's. Still, both of them are multilayered performances.The movie as a whole is also amazing. It's the combination of Charles's music with everything mentioned here that makes Ray such a powerful movie. We see his transition from coming up from the dregs of society to become one of America's top entertainers, and his crusade for equal rights. A movie that doesn't shy from the dark side of things is a hell of a lot more inspirational than some inner-city sports movie. All in all, I'd like to say that Ray may very well be the best movie of the year, and I'd like to congratulate Jamie Foxx on his Oscar win.My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 for depiction of drug addiction, sexuality and some thematic elements.",10,2,4,2 November 2004
The Lion King," The Lion King: 9/10
","Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.The Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.My rating: 9/10Rated G for intense thematic elements.",9,116,153,28 December 2002
The Terminal," The Terminal: 8/10
","I'm a Steven Spielberg fan. His movies always have some sort of annoying staple to them: they almost all involve annoying precocious kids, they all have a happy ending, and they all go on for too long. But I respect him, and I think he's a very talented director. And now it seems like this guy can do no wrong. He's in the works for Indiana Jones 4 and Jurassic Park IV, and he came off of the hugely entertaining Catch Me If You Can to go onto The Terminal, a light, enjoyable, and surprisingly funny movie that is Tom Hanks' best role since Forrest Gump or before. Add Kumar Pallana (Pagoda from The Royal Tenenbaums) and Catherine Zeta-Jones in an underdeveloped role, and you've got all of the makings for a good movie.Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is an immigrant from the fictional country of Krakozhia whose country, once he lands at JFK, erupts in a civil war and a military coup. His passport is now invalid and he's not allowed to leave the airport without it. Therefore, he has to live at the airport until he can leave. Barely speaking a word of English, Viktor slowly becomes adapted to living at Gate 67 and meeting many of the people who work there, including flight attendant Amelia (Zeta-Jones). Meanwhile, airport bureaucrat Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) does everything he can to make Viktor someone else's problem.The airport that was created for this film is, I believe, the largest working set ever created for a movie. And I tell ya, I would love to be stuck in an airport like that. With product placement everywhere and a flight departure/arrival board that seems about 40 years too old, it does seem great. Seriously, though, making a set like that and making it all work is amazing. Making use of it to its fullest potential is even more amazing. It seems like The Terminal has everything-a great set, cinematography, acting, script, directing. I've already talked about the set. Let me go into the others.The cinematography by Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski is really great. Almost all of the shots are done indoors (on the aforementioned set), and many of the shots are sweeping ones done inside. Everything's so precise and very beautiful to look at. Hanks, as an Easter European immigrant, does an amazing job. He actually does seem to be this person, and convinced me. His mannerisms, language, and accent are all perfect. It's either his best work or second to Forrest Gump. The script by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson is great, also. It's very funny, much funnier than I expected. Zeta-Jones' character doesn't have much to do, but her mediocre work is balanced with Hanks' amazing work. The script has the right amount of pathos and comedy, a coherent, flowing sense to it, and, well, is just overall great. And lastly, Spielberg's direction. He seems to show some restraint here, and doesn't go for his usuals I mentioned earlier as much. There's no children, but there's a happy ending and a bit could have been taken out. The ending was just kind of there. Nothing that exciting. But The Terminal is a surprising movie-one that almost needs to be seen to be believed.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for brief language and drug references.",8,0,1,27 June 2004
The Cannonball Run," The Cannonball Run: 6/10
","Cannonballers. A person who participates in the annual race called `The Cannonball Run'. The Cannonball Run is one of the annual movies that is broadly funny with a whole slough of stars.One pair of two is J.J. and Victor (Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise), a bumbling pack of two who use an ambulance for this cross-country race. This means they need a patient, so they kidnap Pamela (Farrah Fawcett). Other pairs include Sammy Davis, Jr. and Dean Martin as priests, Roger Moore as a James Bond type character, and Jamie Farr as a Shiek. Obviously there's not much plot, so just go along with the flow.Constantly throughout this movie, I was reminded of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, with groups going on a wild chase through the country, except this time it's not hidden under a big `dubya'. I laughed quite a bit, but I wish they were lingering and the plot more sustaining. I wasn't expecting more than this, which I guess is good.Movies like this don't require much talking about, so I won't. See it if you want a mildly funny ride, but if you are looking for a hilarious, meaningful film, skip this one.My rating: 6/10Rated PG for language and destructive behavior.",6,0,1,26 March 2003
Scream," Scream: 8/10
","Scream is in the same category as The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. They've been parodied so much it seems like the movie is just a parody of it. Scream is a parody, but an unfunny parody, of the teen slasher flicks of the 80's, such as Halloween and Friday the 13th. In it, a masked killer runs around trying to kill a helpless teenager in a quiet, idyllic small town. Unlike, say, A Nightmare on Elm Street (which was cleverly referenced with `Fred the janitor'), Scream actually had some good scary parts to it, making it a great horror/slasher film, which it didn't want to be.Sidney (Neve Campbell)'s mother was raped and murdered a year ago. Her father is going out of town. A masked killer has already killed Casey (Drew Barrymore) and her boyfriend, and it looks like Sidney's next! Nobody's safe from the masked killer in the famous mask (based on Munch's `Scream' painting), but it's up to Sidney to figure out who he is and why he's killing everyone. I'm not a huge gore fan (but I am a huge Gore fan, pardon the political `humor'), but I'm not squeamish, and I wanted Scream to have a little more gore, but I wasn't complaining. Red was abound but not realistic (I'll get to that later), but I'm happy that Wes Craven didn't go for the PG-13 audience. This would not have worked as PG-13.What makes Scream so scary is that it's more realistic than other slashers. The killer kills in a realistic way (such as, not attacking in dreams), and the victims fight back, knocking out the killer. The killer is real, not some fictional being that exists in the head of the teenagers. The acting is very good for this type of movie, with the standout being Barrymore, who's billed high but is only in a little bit of the movie. Also, I liked all of the horror movie references, and how it's sort of a huge meta-reference. Overall, Scream is a screamingly good time that won't disappoint.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong graphic horror violence and gore, and for language.",8,0,0,7 August 2003
Halloween," Halloween: 4/10
","Each of the three pivotal teen slasher movies had one rising star. A Nightmare on Elm Street had Johnny Depp, Friday the 13th had Kevin Bacon, and Halloween had Jamie Lee Curtis. While the former two were just side characters, undeveloped and there for slaying, Curtis was given the lead role of Laurie Strode (her first movie role, too). And, amazingly enough, she performs quite well. The rest of the movie doesn't perform as well, though.Michael Myers (Tony Moran) killed his sister when he was six years old, and then locked up in a mental institution for fifteen years. He escapes and returns to his hometown, where babysitting highschool/thirty-year-old Laurie (Curtis) is. Myers proceeds to wreck havoc on the town for no reason at all¬Öwell, he doesn't really wreck havoc, all he does is indiscreetly murder a few people while Jamie Lee Curtis screams.I've heard this referred to as being `the scariest movie ever,' blah blah blah. There was almost no horror to it; the way director John Carpenter sets it up is so blas√© and dull. He didn't create any tension leading up to anything: all he did was have a couple murders, a bland sex scene, and young kids. Usually those three things can be put together for an entertaining ride, but here they don't add up to anything.Technically, however, Halloween was good, considering its small budget. Its cinematography was almost too good for the movie itself. Many shots seemed like on take, and the angles were impressive. I've always liked when first person shots were done, and many times we saw things from Michael Myers's point of view, which was more impressive, too.On the other hand, not only was it not scary, but it wasn't believable. I know that movies weren't as violent back then, but there was absolutely no blood throughout the entire movie. I'm not much of a gore hound, but I actually wanted some to add some authenticity. When someone is stabbed, blood comes out, whether the knife is taken out or not. Also, I find it kind of sad when I know more about and care about the cold-blooded killer than the heroine. The character of Laurie is not only the world's worst babysitter but isn't a pleasant character. I almost hope that Carpenter remakes this movie.One thing I abhor about movies like this is that they almost know that there's going to be multiple sequels, so they don't explain everything, especially about Michael. I won't be seeing the sequels, that's for sure, so I would have liked to know what actually happened. Then again, that's some clever plot to make me see them. Although I may grow to like it more, which I probably will, Halloween is not the horror classic everyone makes it out to believe.My rating: 4/10Rated R for scary situations?",4,22,45,18 October 2003
Carrie," Carrie: 8/10
","Carrie boomed Sissy Spacek's and John Travolta's career. I understand why.Carrie starts off at a gym locker room, where we find out how much the other kids hate Carrie. But, we find out that Carrie has some powers. Like in other Stephen King book-movies, the supernatural aspect is only minor compared to the rest of the story, but it comes into play at the end. Carrie's mom (Piper Laurie) is an over-protective religious zealot who makes The Royal Tenenbaums seem normal. So Carrie tries to cope with her horrible life, but it's getting tougher and tougher.Spacek is exceptional as Carrie, and I now know why she was nominated for Best Actress. Her emotions are real, not some fake tear drops that make us think she's sad. Either she has great motivation, or she's one of the best actresses of the century (or both!). Laurie was equally good as her mother who locks Carrie up in a closet everytime she thinks that Carrie has sinned. This movie wouldn't be half of what it was if the acting wasn't so great. When Carrie was sad, you were sad. When the other kids ridiculed her, you felt like you wanted to kill the kids. When she smiled, you smiled. Emotions that raw couldn't come from just any movie.If you know me, I'm a stickler for character developement. Carrie didn't take much time, but from the opening scene you knew about Carrie and her weakness. So are the secondary characters; they're nicely developed even if their role isn't that major. Travolta had a miniscule role, but he was fine in it; it led to Grease and Saturday Night Fever.The prom scene has got to be one of the most memorable scenes from a horror movie. That red tint is awesome; it's like a premonition. In fact, the movie is full of premonition: the red tint, the freaky looking voodoo doll, 'They're all going to laugh at you.' I'm assuming that director Brian De Palma meant to put that in, so it just isn't about some supernatural powers, it's also about foreshadowing. Also, I dig that camera movement during the dancing.The blood and gore wasn't held back, but they just put in what was necessary. De Palma obviously stole from Hitchcock's Psycho, mainly the music cue whenever Carrie is using her telepathy. Also, her school, Bates High, is another Psycho refrence.Carrie was also very creepy. It wasn't a thrill-a-minute, but at the ending, that was Scary with a capital S. The last ten or twenty minutes were scare-inducing for sure. That last jump scene in the dream...wow! It's still jumping at me. If there was one complaint I had to do about the movie, it's that it took too much time to get to main scene and the prom went on a little too long, but other than that it's a first class horrror/thriller that any horror buff needs to see.My rating: 8/10Rated R for nudity, some language, and blood.",8,156,210,13 October 2002
Raging Bull," Raging Bull: 7/10
","Is there anything worse than the overrated classic? I think not, and one movie that falls into that category is Raging Bull. Almost universally praised by both audiences and critics alike, it's one of those true 'classics'. But is it really? To me, it's just another 'good movie': one that if it were released today, I wouldn't feel as bad giving it this review that's lower than most others. Alas, I'll get tons of backlash for this review.Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro, in a weight-gaining role only outshadowed by Vincent D'Onofrio in Full Metal Jacket) is a boxer at the top of his game. He's the middleweight world champion, he recently got married to a beautiful woman (Cathy Moriarty). However, he's not very stable emotionally, and throughout the course of his life, starts to break down. Joe Pesci pops in and out randomly as Jake's manager/brother Joey. But in this movie, he's not funny like a clown.I found Raging Bull to be a very interesting movie. It's a biopic about someone I hadn't even heard of before I heard of this movie. It successfully shows the whole life of someone, not just portions of it, like others do. It gets down deep into the characters, especially Jake, and shows what affects each of the three main characters and why they do what they do. Most movies could learn from this one.However, I didn't really 'feel' anything while watching it. Jake was an interesting chracter, but I didn't feel along with him. When various events occured, I wasn't affected in the way I should have been. I think Martin Scorsese really made a superficial film here. He makes an impressive film to look at, especially in the black and white, and the acting of everyone is great, but underneath the surface, there's nothing really there. But I hope I haven't dissuaded you from seeing Raging Bull. It is a very good movie, and one that you can't go through life without seeing.My rating: 7/10Rated R for violence and language.",7,22,44,23 March 2004
The Silence of the Lambs," The Silence of the Lambs: 8/10
","I think it's gotten to the point where most people don't really care about the Academy Awards anymore, because they're not for individual achievements, but for appreciating an actor or a film because it cost a lot of money. But back before those days, when the Oscars meant something, it was a huge honor to win the five major Academy Awards-picture, actor, actress, director, and screenplay. The Silence of the Lambs is the third, and most recent, one to do that. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins won acting awards, Jonathan Demme won the directing award, and Ted Tally won for best adapted screenplay. Was it deserving for all of those awards? For the most part, more or less.Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins), a serial killer/cannibal who has the identity and the whereabouts of notorious serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), is being interviewed by rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Foster) for information on Bill. But Lecter's more cunning and demented than first glance, and has fun playing with the mind of Starling as she's interviewing him.Since I don't really know what to say about this movie, I'll go my fail-safe way and go over each award it won and why it should have won for that reason. The screenplay, based off of the book by Thomas Harris, has a slow build-up (one that originally turned me off), but as soon as Lecter is introduced, it's paid off. The script takes us inside of the head of Lecter, making him one of the most interesting celluloid characters of the 1990s. The screenplay also doesn't really waste that much time with unimportant characters, although a little more on Jack Crawford would have been nice. But the screenplay is tight and holds together well, throughout the hit-or-miss directing career of Demme.Demme won an Oscar for best directing. I have mixed feelings about this one. On one hand, many scenes in Lambs aren't boring, but not really that exciting or involving. He does have some good style (I love that night-vision scene), and does build up some good suspense as the movie comes to a close. The suspense is laid on thick at the end, and I suppose it makes up for the still entertaining but not thrilling rest of the movie. Demme does set up some mystery, too, as we follow Clarice's adventures. There are also some very disturbing scenes ('It rubs the lotion on the skin or else it gets the hose again!'), which fit in with the tone of most of the movie. Disturbing, yes, but actually impacting? Not really.Both Foster and Hopkins won acting Oscars for leading roles. Foster's character, as I said before, began as being annoying to me, but soon became a person I could tolerate. But was she deserving of an Oscar? A nomination is even a stretch, mainly because of that awful accent of hers. Hopkins was great, but with total screentime being around 16 minutes, he was more of a supporting actor (although, I guess the awards were crooked then. They wanted to give an award to both Jack Palance for City Slickers and Hopkins, but they were both supporting roles). I think we got the gist of Hannibal in those 16 minutes, and Hopkins put in a memorable performance in that time.Lastly, Lambs won best picture. Is it the best picture of 1991? I'm not sure, I haven't seen every film from 1991. But it's a damn good one.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language, violence, and disturbing themes.",8,1,1,17 August 2004
Vanilla Sky," Vanilla Sky: 8/10
","Vanilla Sky takes you on a ride that may look like other mind-benders like Mulholland Drive and Solaris, but this one tries to give you answers. The beginning may be slow, but soon you'll be on the ride of your life.Tom Cruise is David Aames, multimillionaire playboy. He inherited three magazines from his late father, and lives the high life. He's friends with Brian (Jason Lee) and keeps up a strictly play relationship with Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz). Soon, however, Brian introduces Sofia (Penelope Cruz) to David, and Julie's upset, so what's to do? Drive off a bridge and kill herself, while just injuring David. His life, however, becomes a mix of reality and imagination, between dreams and actual happenings.If you want a light, easygoing, crowd pleasing flick that gives you all the answers and wraps the ending in a nice little package with a bow and express ships it to your heart, don't look here. If, however, you want an intellectual film that's both straightforward and confusing, this is a good movie. From swift camera movements to perfect modern music, this movie has it all.Tom Cruise (who, when in his mask and for a lot of the film, reminded me of Kevin Bacon in Hollow Man) did a good job of being a cocky millionaire who gets everything. Of course, to do that, he doesn't have to act much. Cruz, who starred in the original Abre Los Ojos, which this is a remake of, also worked well and had chemistry with Cruise. Diaz, although her part was small, did the best she could do, which was a lot. Kurt Russell, who plays a shrink, did a great job, too, but I wish he was billed before Diaz, because he had more screen time.I really wish I had more to say about Vanilla Sky, but there isn't. I found myself liking this experience more each minute. It did start off slowly, but soon gained pace. I do wish, however, that I could more easily tell between David's dreams and reality. Besides that, it was a very good movie.My rating: 8/10Rated R for sexuality and strong language.",8,2,4,10 March 2003
Bruce Almighty," Bruce Almighty: 6/10
","Bruce Almighty has more continuity errors than an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. Most have to do with the ending, so I won't spoil them, although I'll guess that you will be able to tell what the ending will be. It has its moments, some very good ones at that, but it can't seem to get over its cocky tones. It seems like a vehicle to get Jim Carrey back on target, teamed up with director Tom Shadyac again (Ace Ventura, Liar Liar), and an easy $100 million or so for Universal, and a possibility for a sequel.Anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past two months knows the plot: man revolts against God; man gets God's powers. That man is Bruce Nolan (Carrey), angry that the anchor position at his news station didn't go to him. He's just a lowly reporter who has to get into ridiculous outfits. After he curses God once too often, God Himself (Morgan Freeman) turns up and gives Bruce the chance to have His powers, to see if Bruce can do it better. At first, Bruce uses them to his advantage, but must learn to cope with them.Jim Carrey can be funny when he wants to be, and he can also be a good actor when he wants to be. He returns to his mid-90's slapstick, while incorporating his acting from The Truman Show, and, dare I say it, The Majestic? Although the humor isn't as broad as his earlier work, and the acting isn't as strong, there's still good doses of both. There's as much crude humor as one-liners.However, Bruce Almighty can't keep away from the clich√É¬©s. Bruce can't climb up the ladder, his pretty girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) is a kind preschool teacher, his coworkers are mean, et cetera. If that wasn't bad enough, it also tries to be another `classic' Carrey movie. There's a new `catchphrase' (B-E-A-utiful, which it REALLY stupid), and there's symbolism and meaningful characters and objects that just keep on popping in for no reason, like the prayer bracelet and the bum.Something that always strikes me as odd is all of the complaints against the film. It seems that movies like The Last Temptation of Christ, Dogma, and now Bruce Almighty have Christians boycotting the film for `mocking God.' As the saying goes, God has a sense of humor, look at the platypus. It's just extra marketing and publicity.It had some pretty funny scenes, and at times the laughs were pretty big. I don't, however, understand why the audience was cracking up at the `seven fingers' joke (it's just like `You've got me straight trippin', boo,' from Bringing Down the House). I thought that most scenes were funny, except for the last quarter, when the laughs slowed dramatically. Also, I thought that the cinematography was surprisingly good for a slob comedy like this. It worked best when Bruce was `parting the Red Sea.'Could Jim Carrey be coming back to what made him famous? Could Morgan Freeman be billed higher for being in about three scenes? Will Jennifer Aniston ever be cast in a role other than the `cute girlfriend'? We may find out as Universal will probably release Bruce Almighty 2: Heavens Above!My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for language, sexual content and some crude humor.",6,0,1,24 May 2003
Before Sunrise," Before Sunrise: 7/10
","Romance is basically dead in movies. We get romantic comedies, but those usually involve calling people the wrong name in bed. But epic romances a la Gone with the Wind are basically, um, gone with the wind. That is, before Richard Linklater came along. I'm not calling his Before Sunrise an epic romance by any means, but it's a nice, small romance that actually has believable characters in a believable circumstance. You can't really get that from a recent 'romance'. What Linklater (and co-writer Kim Krizan) create is an engaging love story that, unfortunately, has never heard of 'too much of a good thing'.Taking a train through Europe, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) starts talking with Celine (Julie Delpy). He convinces her to get off of the train in Vienna to spend his last European night with him. They wander around the town, talking about life, the universe, and everything, as the clock winds down, because Jesse has to catch a plane.Before Sunset, the sequel to Sunrise, has basically the same format. The conversations in both are very interesting and entertaining, but I'd say that Sunrise's conversations were more varied. Some were more interesting, some were less interesting, and some were mediocre. But it's the conversations that make both Befores such great movies. They let you get inside of the characters, realize what they're thinking and how much like real people they are. And not only is the dialogue entertaining, but it's thought-provoking and all natural. It all seems ad libbed, which it isn't, which finalizes the humanity and the true-to-life qualities of these people.But where the second one succeeded, the first one failed. The second came in at a quick 80 minutes, which was 80 minutes of dialogue shown in real time, creating a very intimate bond between the audience and the characters. In Sunrise, it's not in real time (which is okay, but not up to par with the sequel), which allowed unnecessary establishing shots to be put in. But what was the worst about this movie was its inability to end. Instead of doing something like the short 'n sweet 80 minutes of the second film, after 80 minutes is up, Sunrise isn't over yet! You've had enough of these characters and you want the movie to end (in a good way), but the movie keeps on chugging along. It goes on for 20 more minutes, and it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. Obviously, you should see this movie before the sequel, but I think it's safe to say that Sunset is the better movie overall.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.",7,7,13,11 August 2004
The Deer Hunter," The Deer Hunter: 10/10
","Most young people today need to learn that Robert De Niro was not just  the person in Meet the Parents or The Adventures of Rocky and  Bullwinkle, but he starred in films like The Deer Hunter, which got him  to where he is today. Not only is he a great actor, he always picks  good films to act in. And with a strong supporting cast, also, you  can't really go wrong with The Deer Hunter.  Michael (De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Steven (John Savage)  sign up to go to Vietnam. They leave after a farewell party/wedding  party for Stanley and Angela (Rutanya Alda). Once in the  midst of the war, they are forced into playing Russian Roulette and  eventually they escape, but none of them can forget the experiences  from the war.  It's sad to see that Michael Cimino fade from view, because his  direction here is really memorable and it's what holds the film  together. There's about 70 minutes in the beginning of the film that  has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but it gets us to know  these three main characters, and it seems like you wouldn't care if  they even went to Vietnam, because you certainly were intrigued by  these three people. And once they're in the perils of war, you feel  enough for these three basic people to get through the war.  The Russian Roulette scenes are harrowing, even when it's a complete  stranger who has the gun to their head. I read that to get the tension  on set, a live bullet was put into the gun, but it was checked to make  sure that it wasn't the one about to be shot. And, since you've known  these people for 90 minutes already, you obviously didn't want them to  die, making them all the more nervous.  The Deer Hunter is quite unlike another great Vietnam film, Full Metal  Jacket. While FMJ just showed the immediate results, this movie showed  the results immediately and in the future, back at home. This helped  make everything seem more realistic, which it was. For each of the  three main characters, the war has changed them greatly, and none for  the better.  De Niro is great, but the stand out here is Walken, who accurately  takes his role and makes it into something memorable. Thankfully, he  won best supporting actor. Meryl Streep was nominated as a supporting  character, deservedly. However, this movie is not all about the acting,  it's about the feeling you get. As one character says, 'I don't know  how I feel.' That's exactly how you'll feel after seeing this  tour-de-force.  My rating: 10/10  Rated R for strong language and violence.",10,139,218,18 January 2004
Identity," Identity: 8/10
","In the beginning of Identity, a series of bizarre coincidences bring ten strangers, including Ed (John Cusack), a limo driver for Caroline Suzanne (Rebecca De Mornay), Det. Rhodes (Ray Liotta), transporting a criminal, and George York (John C. McGinley), with his son Timothy (Bret Loehr), and injured wife Alice (Leila Kenzle). As torrential rain pours down in the middle of desert Nevada, people start dying in weird ways, and everyone has to stay safe.In the middle of the time of Darkness Falls and House of 1000 Corpses, here comes an intelligent, mostly original horror films that tries to go back to the hey-day of Friday the 13th and the like. It has some gruesome murders, some good scares, some cheap scares, good acting, and a great ending.The MPAA states that Identity is rated R for `strong violence and language.' The violence wasn't that strong, but some of the images were horrific, such as the one in that shed (I won't say any more). I'm glad that there's a horror movie that a) doesn't go for the teenager, PG-13 crowd, or b) goes for the all-out gore. It was also scary for a lot of the time, although it made me jump some times, going for cheap scares. A lot of times, I thought there would be one when there actually wasn't one.Cusack was convincing as a limo driver, he's a good actor to begin with, and here's just another one of his movies. Liotta, who usually doesn't do much for me, was good, although he can't really sway from being a cop. Amanda Peet, who played a hooker named Paris, put in another outstanding acting job, proving her versatility. She can do slapstick comedy (The Whole Nine Yards), drama (Igby Goes Down), and now scary horror films. McGinley was had me believed that he was a worrying husband, although I didn't recognize him. Maybe I have his image from Office Space in my mind.For some unknown reason, the ending of Identity reminded me of the ending of Vanilla Sky. They both explained a lot at the end, although in the latter, there were still questions, while here I understood everything. I thought it made perfect sense, and the last scene is priceless. It will keep you guessing, with different thoughts as you go through it, and, I can assure you, none of them will be right.Music makes or breaks a movie, and here, it makes. It adds complete tension to many scenes, although it is basic and stereotypical horror music. The characters were all weird, and comes from those characters one of my favorite lines: `You aren't pregnant? Then why the hell did we get married?' I really enjoyed Identity, it is a creepy and fun ride that you probably won't forget for a while.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong violence and language.",8,0,1,25 April 2003
X2: X-Men United," X2: 6/10
","For a while, X2: X-Men United was called simply X2, until Fox decided to add X-Men United. Even in the opening credits (which seems to have been stoles from Spider-Man), it was simply X2. This shows for the rest of the movie, also: it's indecisive. Is it an action movie, romance, comic book, comedy?This second installment of this popular comic book franchise has Logan, aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) coming back to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngesters, run by Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Wolverine has claws and can heal himself, while Xavier has extraordinary telepathy. Other X-Men (mutants) include Storm (Halle Berry), with weather controlling powers, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), with telekinesis, Cyclops (James Marsden, with a smaller role this time around), with laser vision, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can suck the life out of anything. New X-Men include Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), who can disappear and reappear, Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who can manipulate fire, and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). On the other side of the law are Magento (Ian McKellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can change forms.General William Stryker (Brian Cox) is going against mutants, and tries to kill them all. To go against Stryker, both good and bad mutants have to team up and defeat Stryker. That's how the X-Men United got in the name.Put simply, X2 tries to be too many things. It has a psuedo-love story, but ultimately doesn't seem to have one central goal. There was a love triangle between Cyclops, Jean, and Wolverine, except it's only talked about a few times, and didn't add anything to the plot. Also, Rogue and Iceman have some sort of relationship that adds humor but little more. In fact, if some of the subplots would have been taken out, this 140 minute movie could have been under two hours, such as another mutant like Wolverine.Special effects dominate this movie. Obviously, they looked fake, but there were very cool. However, there weren't that many fight scenes, and many of them were just Wolverine killing people. If some of the original X-Men were doing their schtick, such as Cyclops, then it would have been more interesting. Although it isn't boring, it's just not heart-pounding or exciting. The special effects were very cool, though.Jackman does another job of covering up his strong accent, and he clearly had fun with his role, not taking it seriously. McKellen puts in another great acting job, as does Stewart. Berry and Janssen both looked hot in skintight outfits, as did Romijn-Stamos (although she was wearing nothing at all). Paquin didn't have much of a role this time, nor did Marsden. Cox, who is now almost as ubiquitous as Amanda Peet now, was good, although I think he was coaxed into this role.X2: X-Men United is a special effects piece that isn't as fun or entertaining as other comic book movies, but overall you probably won't be disappointed.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence, some sexuality and brief language.",6,0,0,4 May 2003
Am√©lie," Amelie: 7/10
","If you've ever done something good for someone else just for the fun of it, then you can easily relate to Am√®lie, the main character in Am√®lie. She's innocent, na√Øve, and shy. But she finds an old box of `treasures' hidden in her flat and decides to return it to the boy who left it there fifty years ago. The `boy' is Bretodeau (Maurice B√©nichou), and Am√®lie (Audrey Tautou) decides that if Bretodeau is glad, then she will continue to do good deeds for those around her. He is ecstatic, so Am√®lie keeps her end of the deal.Am√®lie is sweetly touching, but goes for the low-key effect and really does feel like a foreign film. A lot of times, I forget during the course and it seems like the actors are saying the subtitled English words. Not this time. I'm thinking of Run Lola Run in specific. That seemed to be a quality American film (haha, right?).Am√®lie decides to return a photo album to Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz). She completes her deed but ends up falling in love (surprise surprise). When Am√®lie was delivering the album to Nino (and other times), I was surprised on how complex her schemes were. She didn't explode with talent like that throughout the film, so it surprised me.Tautou is very good as Am√®lie, I love her smile. She displayed emotions very well. Kassovitz was also fabulous; people like that need to get more work that comes out here in the U.S. Everyone else involved in the picture is very gifted (including Rufus, who plays Am√®lie's father) and talented. Pictures like this don't come out very often.Movies like Am√®lie are sure to be crowd-pleasers. Which it is. Its crowd-pleasing attitude was taken with a little arrogance, but it still managed to keep a goofy smile on your face for 122 minutes. Speaking of the runtime, I found it very hard to sit through, for some reason. I enjoyed all of it, but seemed unnecessary. If one of the subplots about Am√®lie's escapades were taken out, it would have been better.It also had a good amount of humor. I loved the beginning, when we learn about Am√®lie's childhood, and we learn what everyone's likes and dislikes were. It seemed ridiculous yet true. Some of the humor, and the whole movie, faltered during the last hour-the rather quick pace of the first hour slowed down a lot and brought down my experience of the film.Am√®lie is a gentle yet entertaining non-Hollywood film that's a sure crowd-pleaser.My rating: 7/10Rated R for sexual situations.",7,3,6,25 December 2002
The Sixth Sense," The Sixth Sense: 10/10
","The second highest grossing movie of 1999, the 14th highest grossing movie of all time, and six Oscar nominations are pretty high achievements. And to whom do they belong? M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense.The Sixth Sense begins with simple enough opening credits, and then we see Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams) after Malcolm had won a prestigious award for child psychiatry. However, they hear rustling, and a former patient, Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg), comes in and accuses him of not curing himself. Vincent then shoots Malcolm and himself.Six or eight months later, Malcolm finds a new patient, Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment). He has problems at home, and so does Malcolm. It seems that Malcolm has put so much time into his work he can't spend any more time with Anna. However, as Malcolm's sessions with Cole become more productive and we find out why Cole is so upset-`I see dead people.' So Malcolm has to figure out why they attack Cole while sorting out problems at home with Anna.There is not one thing I would change about this movie. The acting is top-notch, the chills are supreme and genuine, and I found myself loving this movie.Osment was, for lack of a better word, screwed at the Oscars. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than Michael Caine (though he also was excellent in The Cider House Rules). Osment displayed solid emotions and really did everything his role required him to do. If Tatum O'Neal can win an Oscar at a young age, so could Osment. Willis didn't say one `yippie-kay-yay' and portrayed his role earnestly and with lots of heart. Williams and Toni Collette (who plays Cole's mother) also did outstanding jobs, but perhaps the most standout performance (next to Osment) was Wahlberg. His part was tiny, but important, and he worked hard for it, losing thirty pounds and displaying true fear, just like Osment.Rather than going for the ultra-gore, Shyamalan went for perfect creeps. With chilling music that gets you at the bone, he uniquely displayed torments to the characters and to us. Although I have seen the movies many times, I was still spooked. I feel glad that he didn't have to go to the lowest common denominator and show blood and brain matter everywhere (during a suicide, he was nice enough to keep it off screen). This is a movie that, if you rent on a Saturday night, you'll be up till dawn.Shyamalan (who also wrote) decided to put in strong dramatic elements. Willis slowly losing his wife was played with great tenderness and not mockery or cruelness. Its ginger display of human life taking a turn for the worse really stood out. That is good movie making when you can combine three things to make a standout movie: acting, thrills, and drama.I actually wanted The Sixth Sense to go on for a lot longer. I wanted to see more of the plight of Malcolm and Cole; I was transfixed. And the ending twist still was somewhat of a shock, even though I know what it was. I couldn't see it even if it stared me in the face, which it did. Shyamalan put in symbolism, which becomes obvious once you see it the second time. Evidence for the twist is so obvious when you are watching it for a repeated time, you'll wonder how you missed it. As I said before: that's great moviemaking.My rating: 10/10Rated PG-13 for intense thematic material and violent images.",10,0,0,12 January 2003
The Producers," The Producers: 9/10
","When you see a movie once and think it's hilarious, that's a good sign. When you see a movie about a half-dozen times and think it's still hilarious, that's more than a good sign. That means that not only can you put up with seeing it multiple times, but you also find new things that you didn't see before. Plus, there are some scenes that are too hilarious not to laugh at! The chemistry between stars doesn't hurt, either. What movie am I talking about? Mel Brooks' The Producers, his most sustained and inspired piece of lunacy!Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel have amazing chemistry as meek accountant Leo Bloom and scheming Broadway producer Max Bialystock. Max seduces little old ladies for checks, and when Leo comes into his office one day, he finds that a producer can make more money with a flop instead of a hit. They decide to do his ploy, and create the world's worst play, Springtime for Hitler (a gay romp with Adolf and Eva), and meet interesting characters, including author Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), director Roger DeBris (Christopher Hewett), and their Hitler, Lorenzo St.DuBois, aka L.S.D. (Dick Shawn).What makes this comedy such a gem is its mixture of types of comedy. There is slapstick, there's satire, there's bad taste, and everything but the kitchen sink! The scenes I have seen so many times, but what makes me love them is how they, mainly Wilder, play their roles. Wilder is somewhat crazy, and relies on his blanket to calm himself down. Not only does he have comic perfection, he's a darned good actor to boot! Mostel is great as the would-be sleazy loser-producer, with eye movements that put Silent Bob to shame and a great voice.The songs in it are great, also. Two of them were written by Brooks himself, `Springtime for Hitler' (with which I have auditioned for a role in a musical with) and `Prisoners of Love'. They're both very funny (real Brooks-ian) (note to Merriam-Webster: include that word right next to `bling-bling'). It's not exactly a musical, but The Producers is in a class of its own. Long live The Producers!My rating: 9/10Rated PG for bad taste and homosexual themes.",9,54,65,9 July 2003
Final Destination," Final Destination: 8/10
","When you go to watch a movie like Final Destination, which is obviously a teen horror movie, you take your chances. You could get something genuinely creepy yet tongue-in-cheek, like Scream, or you could wind up seeing something like Darkness Falls or They. You just never know. When Final Destination came up on my Netflix list, I didn't know what to expect. Would it be something original and scary, or just some lame dud? Thankfully, it turned out to be the former.Alex (Devon Sawa), along with about 40 others, are all set to take off on a plane destined for their senior trip in France. Right before it is set to take off, however, he has a premonition that shows him that soon after takeoff the plane will crash and everyone on board will be dead. He and others are forced off of the plane, and, sure enough, the plane crashes with everyone else on board. While everyone thinks that Alex caused the accident, he knows that they were supposed to die on board. Soon, everyone who was supposed to be on the plane start dying one by one.Knowing that this was written and directed by the same team who did Willard, I knew that a lot of the movie wouldn't be just needless blood, but that there would be some sort of a creepy atmosphere to it all. And, by gum, there was. Although it wasn't as atmospheric as the aforementioned movie, and it relied a lot on sudden violence, it was still creepy. It seems like horror movies today rely on quick jumps to scare the audience. Final Destination sure had some, but also the music and the general movie itself was thrilling. When you could see that something was going to happen, you wanted to yell at the character to not do so-and-so. Then you sit back and enjoy the ride.Something else that surprised me was how many special effects were needed. That was one major drawback. At times, the special effects didn't look real AT ALL (re: the bathroom scene), or there were too many when less is more (re: the final, climactic storm). One other thing that upset me was the constant need to do odd lighting. Because of the off-again, on-again lighting, it's sometimes impossible to tell what's happening. In Final Destination's pursuit to become something ultra-modern, nifty camera movements are tried, but for the unnecessary reasons. For example, a long, overhead tracking shot is used when two people are going to the bathroom. Very unnecessary, if you ask me. I just realized how much Glen Morgan and James Wong are fascinated with people going to the bathroom. There must be a few scenes of that in Final Destination, and one quite humorous one in WillardI also thought that the movie took too long to get started. We understand that Alex will see the plane crashing, but for about the first half hour that's all that's `implied'. It's very annoying. Thankfully, the characters aren't as stupid as they usually are in teen horror movies, and I did like all of the talk about `death's pattern', etc. Overall, get on board to Final Destination and it won't crash.My rating: 8/10Rated R for violence and terror, and for language.",8,34,49,18 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King: 8/10
","New Line Cinema made a gamble financing the huge Lord of the Rings films. If the first one went big, then the other two would do even bigger. If it failed, then New Line would probably collapse, because after financing the huge movies, they had no way to recuperate the money that they lost. Thankfully for New Line, the first one was a huge hit, and the second, even bigger. However, the third looks to be the biggest, with good reason. It's the best one of this mediocre series.Continuing where The Two Towers left off, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is carrying the ring, whose powers, besides corrupting those who have it, are never shown in this epic (which would have been a nice reminder to people like myself who haven't really even thought of the series since the last one). He is accompanied by his fellow hobbit Sam (Sean Astin) and weird former-hobbit Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis) to destroy the ring in the fires of Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), a human, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), an elf, and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), a dwarf, go looking for Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), two other hobbits who are part of the broken fellowship that was made to carry the ring to its death. There's a couple more sub-plots, which bloat out this three-hour twenty-minute epic.I think the main reason that Return of the King is the best in the trilogy is because its main fight scene isn't overdone and isn't that long. Unlike The Two Towers, it was never boring. And, instead of just a bunch of computer generated people fighting, there were also computer generated elephants stomping on the computer generated people that were fighting. It was something new, not just swordfighting, which can get very boring if you're forced to watch it for half an hour.As Peter Jackson said in the MAD magazine parody `The Bored of the Rings: The 2+ Hours', `I have learned to speak fluent Elvish. The only thing I haven't learned is the word 'cut'.' I agree. It is amazing how a mainstream audience can sit through a long movie such as this, and it is unnecessarily long. As I've said with the other movies in the series, many of the too-many subplots could have been taken out. Although it may not have been true to Tolkein's original books, books are often truncated down for movies. With that, it may have been easier to sit through all three. But, amazingly enough, this one didn't seem that long, except for the endings (which I'll get to later).There seems to be certain rules that the Lord of the Rings movies must follow. Every character must die at least once. However, the good guys can mysteriously come back to life, sometimes with a name change (as in Gandalf's color change). Half of the excellent cinematography must be spent on showing us that it is not being shot inside of a soundstage, and the other half must be spent on grotesque close-ups of uncharacterized Orcs that look and speak like Yoda. Towns can be randomly placed on huge hills.Return of the King is a very riveting experience. Because this is like nothing else, you cannot be certain that the ring is actually going to be destroyed. That, since you've been with these characters for nine hours, you're basically yelling at the screen what you want to happen.The romantic subplot (or subplots, I'm really not sure) are really unnecessary. I didn't remember who these people were, and, yet again, they just come in randomly. To tell the truth, I don't really care that Aragorn loves this person, and she doesn't love back, or vice versa. It's little things like that that make the movie a little less enjoyable. There's about three women in the movie, and yet they're the thing the average movie goer doesn't like about the movie.Towards the end of the movie, I thought it to be directed by Steven Spielberg. There are about five false endings to it. If I can recall to last night correctly, after each, the entire audience was about to get up and leave after each one. In fact, the person I was sitting next to said, after the final ending, `Is it finally over?' She loved the movie, but the endings don't do the movie justice.The real strong point of the movie isn't the special effects to make Gollum (who went from lovable fool in The Two Towers to just annoying in Return of the King), nor the battle sequences, but Sean Astin's acting. Although he is a hobbit, he still portrayed human emotions, and made him the character in the movie I cared about the most. Wood seems to have taken way too many eyedrops; I don't recall seeing him blink once. Ian McKellan, as Gandalf, does barely wizarding, making the fact that he is a wizard a moot point.I was surprised by Return of the King. Instead of something mediocre like I was expecting, it turns out to be one of the better movies of the year.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for intense epic battle sequences and frightening images.",Null,0,0,21 December 2003
The Matrix," The Matrix: 7/10
","Thomas A. Anderson is in trouble. Words appear on his computer screen, telling him to 'follow the white rabbit'. He does, and a mysterious woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) tells him that 'they have been looking for him' and says something about the Matrix, leaving Thomas very confused. In his work the next day, Thomas is chased by some guys. Not exactly 'good guys'. He meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Morpheus tells him that once he goes into the real world, he can never go back. Thomas, who becomes Neo, does. And he finds out about the Matrix and everything.That may not make sense, but it does in the movie. Thomas A. Anderson/Neo is played by Keanus Reeves, keeping his status as 'cool action dude' real. He originally is skeptical, but soon learns the truth, and he begins, shall I say, enjoy it.The Matrix draws you in with special effects gadgets and weird things, but soon teeters away from that, making you glued to your seat because you're wating for the next one. While there are tremondous special effects (some were under-utilized, I'm assuming they'll be in the sequels), some of the characters came and went, and the script (by the directors, the Wachowski brothers) didn't really introduce them to us. Maybe if a little less of the fighting (which was very cool) and more of the basics had been there, it would have been easier.Of course, movies like this can't be without mumbo-jumbo. The mystical Morpheus does most of it-talking philosophically and not making sense at times. I got the rudimentary idea behind most of it (like that they actually didn't go the Matrix, etc.), but it tried to get oo in-depth.The Matrix was fun and enjoyable, with some heartpounding scenes and cool special effects (love that bullet-stopping). The acting was all very good-Reeves, as I've said before, was good and might be coming back. Fishburne is good as the guy who knows everything but cannot speak it (i.e. Dobby?), and I love Moss-she's great and a rising action star. I didn't really notice that Joe Pantoliano was there, but his voice sounded familiar. He looks a lot different than from Memento.The Matrix is a fun FX ridden piece that doesn't waste time on 'trivial' aspects such as characters.My rating: 7/10Rated R for sci-fi violence and brief language.",7,0,0,15 December 2002
Cube," Cube: 7/10
","I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty tired of all these wanna-be horror movies that are out now. All of those movies are rated PG-13 and can't seem to scare anyone. But right at the verge of these so-called horror movies came Cube, a low-budget horror film with an original idea and a good idea of how to execute it. It could have gone belly-up, but it works for the most part and creates a suspenseful movie.A group of seven people find themselves trapped in some sort of maze of cubes. They're all different colors and to make matters more interesting, some are booby trapped. They have no recollection of how they got there, nor do they have a clue how to get out. It becomes a battle of wits to stay sane and survive.There's an overall sense of creepiness, doom, and claustrophobia that overshadows the whole movie, not to mention the paranoia that sinks into both the characters and you as you watch. You only know as much as the characters-you don't know how they got into the cubes, what they're for, or any of the typical exposition. And although most of the characters were annoying, it put you side by side with them, which helped a lot. If you get to be next to the characters, you can understand their actions more. However, you do (somewhat) find out what these cubes were made for, which kind of dampers the whole thing, but it's still very interesting to go through.But when the climax comes about, the movie descends into hokey B-horror land, with a terrorized killer stalking most of the people. When the original exploration of the cubes subsides and you get the people walking around, also, the interest starts to wane. It's often repetitive, but the booby traps are quite, for lack of a better word, fun. But that doesn't mean that the original creativity has gone away, it's just not as interesting. But I really liked Cube, and if you see it, you will too.My rating: 7/10Rated R for some strong sci-fi violence/gore and language.",7,78,102,26 June 2004
The Great Escape," The Great Escape: 8/10
","Young children will know it as Chicken Run, while older folk (like myself, at the ripe old age of 14) know it as The Great Escape, the classic POW escape film from 1963 with Steve McQueen and James Garner. With its familiar score by Elmer Bernstein, The Great Escape puts us into a German POW camp and we go along with everybody to try to escape in this three hour film.The smorgasbord of characters include Hilts, the `Cooler King' (McQueen), who spends much of his time in isolation, Hendley, the `Scrounger' (Garner), who can get anything he wants, and Danny, the `Tunnel King' (Charles Bronson). During WWII, these people are sent to the POW camp, and decide to escape by digging three tunnels under the camp, nicknamed Tom, Dick, and Harry. If one fails, then they move onto the next. Two hours are spent on this, and the third is spent on what happens to those who escape.Wait a minute! Did I just give away the ending? No, because of two reasons. One is the title: The Great Escape. It isn't called The Great Attempt to Escape. Also, the opening titles say how this is a true story, et cetera, so you know what basically happens. That doesn't mean, however, that it isn't a thrilling and enthralling piece of work. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat for the entire piece, but the 2 hours and 52 minutes flew by, and I didn't want to leave the film. I was engaged with everything this picture brought me: an interesting ensemble of characters (alas, like all ensemble movies like this, it's hard to keep track of EVERY character), an interesting and authentic (and I mean AUTHENTIC) set, and a certain air of unpredictability. I knew what was going to happen for some of it, but what happened overall and to each individual, I had no idea.There were some very good action scenes, also. Hilts, after he escapes, is evading German officers on a motorbike (possibly the most famous sequence of the film). He did most of the stunts himself. There was never a dull moment. The set looked very authentic, and it was shot on location. Although it's obvious how they shot it, it really looked like a tunnel under a POW camp. To sum everything up, The Great Escape is a very entertaining, three-hour classic that won't disappoint you.My rating: 8/10Not Rated",8,4,7,29 May 2003
Jackie Brown," Jackie Brown: 8/10
","Expectations ruin movies. I was talking to my brother about Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to Pulp Fiction. He said the movie 'bombed' because people didn't think it was as good as Pulp Fiction and made less money. Although many were disappointed that it didn't rise to Pulp-like statue, and that it didn't make as much money as it (less than 20%), but does that automatically make Jackie Brown a terrible movie? No. On the contrary, it's a nice departure from the frenzied pace of Pulp, and shows Tarantino's growth in this medium.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight attendant at a small airline. She works in transferring money via the airline, but soon she is caught. In order to reduce, or eliminate her sentence, she helps the police get Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), an arms dealer, put away. However, with the help of bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), she starts to play both sides like a modern-day Yojimbo. Plus, Robert De Niro using a large bong!Tarantino takes a breather between Pulp and the Kill Bill movies here with a (for the most part) nonviolent drama. It's slow, but it's refreshing. In the age of quick cuts and techno music that's overused, it's good to see a film like this. The pace is slow, sometimes too slow for its own good, but it never gets boring or tedious. The movie does have a few stylish flairs, but it looks low budget, and feels low budget. This movie seems normal-none of the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am dialogue that made Pulp so famous. There's almost no memorable dialogue in Jackie Brown, but does that mean that it's a terrible movie? According to many people, yes. In my opinion, no.The thing is, although Jackie is about 20 minutes too long, it's entertaining throughout. The script, based on Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, keeps our interests throughout, mainly because of Pam Grier. Her endearing work makes the movie worth watching. Her no-holds-barred attitude in the movie makes it continually interesting. Jackson puts in an average show-nothing can top Jules Winnfield. De Niro looks like he's doing a favor for a friend-or Tarantino just wanted him in the movie. But chronically stoned Melanie (Bridget Fonda) put in a good job. The acting's not as good as previous Tarantinos, but for the most part, it's good.So, let me sum up everything I've said. Jackie Brown is an entertaining, long (by about 20 minutes), and enjoyable movie. See it.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong language, some violence, drug use and sexuality.",10,7,13,25 May 2004
Sin City," Sin City: 9/10
","I wasn't really cognizant of the release of Pulp Fiction, as I was at the age of six. But I can see how it could have changed the history of cinema and how it effected the times. And when fanboys all over the USA heard about Sin City, based on three of Frank Miller's cult graphic novel series, they all clamored that it would be the next Pulp Fiction. Why would these people say that? Maybe it's how the ads plastered 'Guest Director Quentin Tarantino' all over the place. Or maybe it's because it has a similar 'neo-noir' style. Or maybe even the three-intersecting-storyline aspect. Whatever the case may be, Sin City turned out to not be the next Pulp Fiction. But it's just about as cool.Sin City's comprised of three stories which all take place in Basin City, or Sin City, where prostitutes and hit men are rampant all over the streets. In 'The Hard Goodbye,' Marv (Mickey Rourke), after sleeping with Goldie (Jaime King), finds her dead and goes on a rampage to avenge her death. In 'The Big Fat Kill', Dwight (Clive Owen) helps out a bunch of prostitutes reclaim the streets from the cops. And in 'That Yellow Bastard', Hartigan (Bruce Willis) goes to find Nancy (Jessica Alba), whom he saved years earlier from a man who's been colored yellow (Nick Stahl) after Hartigan...rendered him useless. Actually, there's a short fourth story as the bookends to the movie from 'The Customer is Always Right' with Josh Hartnett.If there could be one clich√É¬© phrase to describe Sin City, it would be 'style over substance.' Shot almost entirely in black and white (save for some well-placed color images), and with computer generated backgrounds (like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, except people saw Sin City), it looks great. It looks almost exactly like Miller's graphic novels, including some segments with pen-and-ink graphics to completely replicate Miller's novels. Anyone who dislikes Sin City says that it didn't have enough story. But when you see the trailers, you know that this is what you're getting. You're getting the best-looking movie of the past few years. It's better than all of these so-called 'advancements' in CGI. It does for visual film-making what Peter Jackson's Braindead did for blood.Of course, there's also no denying the absolute...coolness of the plot. It's a complete guy's movie: every female character is either a prostitute, stripper, has a nude scene, or a combination of all three. All of the guys have guns and kill and torture people. It's almost like an old-time Western, or something like that, except with more blood and female nudity. The way that the plot is connected is done in a very cool way, with a little connection between them all. And we can't forget about director Robert Rodriguez's ultra cool direction. With Rodriguez, there's never a dull moment in the film. It's a non-stop ride, which is already getting me excited for Sin City 2 and 3.All of the actors were great in portraying their tough-as-nails characters. The standouts, though, were Owen and Benecio Del Toro (who was also in 'The Big Fat Kill'). They're just the coolest characters, played by two of the best modern actors. Their standout scene is the scene that Tarantino directed, with the two of them in a car. That scene can basically sum up the whole movie. It's absurd, violent, weird, and absolutely bloody fantastic.My rating: 9/10 Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue.",9,2,4,29 April 2005
Coach Carter," Coach Carter: 8/10
","Samuel L. Jackson can do no wrong (unless it involves a movie with the number 51 in it). Whether it's Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, or even XXX, Jackson always gives off an aura of 'cool'-anyone would want to know him or be him in any of those characters, no matter how wrong the character was. The same holds true for his titular role in Coach Carter. Although it's not one of his 'bad-ass' roles, he comes off as a cool person with a moral core. Ken Carter is the only character audiences can identify with, and therefore we go along with his actions, and understand his motives. Not only that, but it's a refreshing break from these Disney-produced 'These people can do it, so so can you!' sports movies. Instead, it's a hard-hitting, tiring adventure through the true story (what else) of a Northern California town and their trials and tribulations.Ken Carter (Jackson) is hired as the coach of an inner-city basketball team. They're a great team, but lack discipline and academic skills. Carter instigates a vigorous lateness policy (thousands upon thousands of warm-up exercises), and then locks down the gym when the team fails to maintain a 2.3 GPA. Carter handles all controversy handed to him in the typical Samuel L. Jackson manner.Although unfairly compared to Remember the Titans, the two movies couldn't be any more different. Titans had Denzel Washington (who's nowhere near as cool as Jackson) in a sugar-coated movie about racism. Coach Carter IS racist (about a dozen or so n-words...where's Spike Lee on this one?), and there's no real message, except that knowledge is power (somewhat). Being that Carter's PG-13, unlike Titans's PG, it can get away with much more, with a more developed story. There's a lot of subplots, including drug deals and teen pregnancy. It's great to see such adult topics dealt with in a teen movie (well, it's somewhat like a teen movie). And it's not slammed down our throats, either. It's presented, and we take what we want out of it.Not only that, but we're able to identify with Carter and his actions. Although they seem (and are) extreme, we can understand where he's coming from. It's like Kurt Russell's insistence in that one (the only good) scene of Miracle. Plus, there's Samuel L. Jackson, who can make everything except Formula 51 a gem. Plus, there's the fact that I saw the movie over a month ago, and don't really remember much from it. But it's surprisingly great for a January release, and one you should at least pick up on DVD.My rating: 8/10Rated PG-13 for violence, sexual content, language, teen partying and some drug material.",8,1,3,9 February 2005
True Romance," True Romance: 6/10
","As much as I love Quentin Tarantino (well...love his movies), he does get pretty pretentious at times. One prime example was Kill Bill: Volume Two, where he thinks his dialogue is so good that he forgets that it's only good dialogue in a Tarantino fashion if it's funny, also. The same thing happened to True Romance. Often, Tarantino's writing is memorable, making his movies memorable and immortal. Although I'm behind on reviews, so I saw this movie a few weeks ago, I remember almost nothing from this film. There are some speeches characters give that could go down next to the 'Royale with Cheese' sequence from Pulp Fiction, but, alas, they don't for a variety of reasons.Clarence (Christian Slater) is a typical loser. His boss hires prostitute Alabama (Patricia Arquette) to have sex with him on his birthday, and before they know it, they're married. Clarence kills her pimp (Gary Oldman), steals cocaine from him, and goes to Hollywood looking to sell it. The pimp's men go out to chase them. What an exciting story.I'm not going to blame it all on Tarantino. Much of the problem should be directed to director Tony Scott. You may remember him as being the one who took a possibility for a great movie called Man on Fire, chewed it up, spit it back out, and turned it into total crap. He shows more restraint here, making True Romance bearable and, at times, exciting. But nothing in it is memorable-the shootoff in Reservoir Dogs (which wasn't memorable per se) was more memorable. The characters weren't memorable, the scenes and speeches weren't memorable, and most of the movie wasn't memorable. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm making True Romance out to be this awful movie. It really isn't.Some of the movie was interesting (for then), and there's a great scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. It doesn't resonate with me now, but as I was watching the movie, I was thinking how cool it was. While the characters weren't really defined much, they were acted well throughout. Samuel L. Jackson could have done more, though. Then again, Sam Jackson eating cottage cheese is exciting for me. But I digress. True Romance is nowhere near the potential Tarantino has, but if you watch it, you'll probably enjoy it. But don't think about it afterwards or you'll not like it as much.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence, language, and drug use.",6,2,5,15 June 2004
Contact," Contact: 5/10
","Robert Zemeckis is one of the most versatile directors of our time. He's directed fantasy (Back to the Future), horror (What Lies Beneath), comedy (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), drama (Forrest Gump), and now science-fiction in Contact. It's quite obvious that Zemeckis is a Spielberg prot√©g√©, because, like Speilberg, Zemeckis has distinguishable features. While Spielberg has precocious children and endings that go on twenty minutes too long, Zemeckis has that Gump-ish music, precocious children, and endings that go on too long. What Zemeckis creates is very uneven: at one part it's exciting and unpredictable, and then the next it's as boring as watching snails race.Based on the best-selling book by Carl Sagan (to whom this movie is dedicated), Contact basically revolves around Ellie (Jodie Foster), who has dedicated her life to finding life out there (`If there's no one else out there, it seems like an awful waste of space'). She hears radio signals from the star Vega, and after long deductions, it turns out that they are blueprints to build a gigantic machine. Undeveloped characters and media buzz ensues.Possibly the best, and only remarkable part of Contact are the spectacular special effects. Zemeckis always directs great camera movements, and the opening few minutes really show that. Not only does it move with great grace, but also it's amazing to look at. It's breathtaking. The only other technically supreme scene was at the end, but I don't wish to give anything else away. While those two scenes excel in their technology, the rest of the movie isn't as marvelous. Although Zemeckis could have gone the easy way out and made it just eye candy (which would have made the movie a lot more interesting), he decided to throw in one-dimensional characters here and there (I didn't even know that a character was blind until I read about it online) and throw in a weak romance between Ellie and Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey). I don't really see how Ellie could go from rejecting Palmer to making out with him a few scenes later (it seems like a few scenes were taken out here and there to make the runtime shorter). It's not to say that most of the middle is boring, it's just not exciting. Also, was I supposed to have an epiphany or something? I see how this could convince an atheist, but I already believe in God, and the whole `spirituality' thing, although it adds to the characters, seems unnecessary.Jodie Foster, due to the birth of her baby, hasn't been in that many movies, so she must choose the ones that she can act the best in, and it seems like she does. Although most of her scenes involve yelling at someone, she conveyed the right amount of both skepticism and firmness. McConaughey is wasted, as is James Woods and Tom Skerritt. However, David Morse, as Ellie's father in flashback scenes, does an amazingly good job, conveying everything that I know David Morse to not be.If Hollywood produced more movies like Contact, then our movie supply would be better. However, if they were all exactly like it, then it would be no more than the onslaught of mediocre movies we've been having recently.My rating: 5/10Rated PG for some intense action, mild language and a scene of sensuality.",5,1,3,3 September 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Supremacy: 5/10
","Ah, the summer action sequel. It's inevitable, isn't it? With few exceptions, most of them are generic, mindless movies that are marketed well enough to get at least $100 million. For the most part, The Bourne Supremacy fits the bill. It's a sequel (to 2002's The Bourne Identity), it's released in the summer, it's generic but not exactly mindless, and it's marketed well enough to get a good amount of money (although it needs to get more than expected with the flop of Thunderbirds for Universal. Based on the series of books by Robert Ludlum, Supremacy fails where Identity succeeded. Direction. Identity's director was Doug Liman, known for such cult favorites as Go and Swingers, which served the first well with a balance of action and drama. Supremacy's director is Paul Greengrass, who last did Bloody Sunday. Why they picked him to direct this sequel that he ruined, I have no idea.Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), amnesiac former killer for the CIA, is being hunted again by the CIA, as he is framed for a crime he did not commit. He must run to various exotic locations (which sell Lays potato chips, by the way) to escape nameless bad guys. Chris Cooper's character, Conklin, has since died and now Brian Cox takes center stage, showing what a cool actor he is. Joan Allen (unrecognizable to me) plays a random worker in the CIA (see also Julia Stiles, Gabriel Mann).I think Supremacy is the perfect example of how one thing can ruin a movie. The choice of using hand-held cameras is disastrous. Greengrass (who probably is using cameras left over from Sunday) seems to think that the less of a picture you can comprehend, the better it is. During the non-action scenes (much like what annoyed me about Man on Fire), the camera couldn't keep still for a second, making it hard to understand what was happening on screen. Why? Although I understand the want for 'authenticity' for the action scenes, is it really hard to put a camera on a tripod to keep everything still for a couple seconds? And people thought The Blair Witch Project was sickening.... Even during the action scenes, I had no idea what was really happening not only because of the camera work but also because of the lack of development of any of the non-important characters. There are a couple random Russians, a couple random Americans, and they fight. Why? Who knows?On the other hand, even though the action scenes are indecipherable, they were fun to watch. They weren't as fun as the ones in Identity, but they were worthy nonetheless. The car chase scene (completely thrown in randomly) wasn't as energetic as it could have been, and considering the aforementioned atrocity of the camera, I guess it couldn't really have been better. Still, during the fight and action scenes, it was entertaining. The movie as a whole was tolerable, partially engaging, and never left you bored, which is good enough, I suppose. It's not constantly thrilling, but it's not boring.Damon definitely isn't as into his role as he was in Identity. He's basically sleepwalking through his role. Franka Potente has a small role in this one, but she reprises her role as Marie. Personally, I think she was much better in Run Lola Run. Hell, it could be the only thing she's great in. But forget those two. The man on the screen is Brian Cox, as I've said. This man can do anything, act well, and be completely cool while he's at it. He's one of the coolest actors out there besides Ving Rhames, Sam Jackson, and R. Lee Ermey. But Cox can't save The Bourne Supremacy. It may have its moments, but add up a whole lot of moments and you'll barely get a second.My reviews: 5/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action, and for brief language.",5,1,3,2 August 2004
Dodgeball," Dodgeball: 7/10
","There's nothing greater in comedies than people being hit in the groin. Expand that into 90 minutes and you've got the basic plot of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. No, strike that. It's 90 minutes of groin hits, Ben Stiller being stupid (it's what he does best), and wrench throwing. But in silly, uncomplicated comedies like this, anything slapstick works, and most of the movie does. Sure, it's no slapstick classic, but from a rookie writer/director (Rawson Marshall Thurber, who also did the successful 'Terry Tate: Office Linebacker' ad during the Super Bowl), it's far from bad.Peter (Vince Vaughn) owns 'Average Joe's' gym, a rundown shack of a place which is unfortunate enough to be next to corporate Globo Gym, run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller). Average Joe's is in danger of closing unless it gets $50,000. The ragtag gym regulars decide to start a dodgeball team and go to Vegas for a dodgeball tournament, where the winners get (surprise, surprise) $50,000. But White makes his own team as they go head-to-head. Kate (Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife) is thrown into the mix and eventually joins the Average Joe's.Unlike most movies now, most of Dodgeball's jokes were not in the trailers. The funniest character has to be Patches (Rip Torn) as a paraplegic former Dodgeball champion who trains the Average Joes. Every line he says is insulting and derogatory, but he's really very funny. Second is Steve the Pirate (Alan Tudyk), a guy on the team who, well, thinks he's a pirate. That's about all I'll spoil, because most of it is new and clever. Sure, like all comedies, it drags towards the end (and becomes drawn out and dramatic), but in general, the second half had more laughs than the first. Most of them were either from Stiller (his best role since...uh...Starsky and Hutch?) or being hit by balls. Sure, it got old, and the sound effect they always used was annoying, but it was still quite funny.Thurber seems to know how to balance the characters (such as which characters are the most important so those characters get development), and it really shows. It's hard to really explain, but you'll see if you go to the movie. Yet he can't keep away from the typical romance. Kate and White/Peter have such throwaway romances that they aren't even worth talking about. In fact, this whole movie is a throwaway movie. It's very funny, but you probably won't remember that you even saw it soon after. Except for Stiller's 'Joanie loves Chachi!' It's seen in the trailers and it's probably the funniest line in the movie due to the context. Overall, Dodgeball is not a memorable movie, but quite a funny one, and it's worth seeing.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for rude and sexual humor, and language.",7,0,0,18 June 2004
The Godfather," The Godfather: 7/10
","I hate reviewing classic movies, since most have a reputation and I feel like I'm not an actual moviegoer/critic if I don't like the classics or give them a certain rating. Anyway, I finally got to see The Godfather. I was a little disappointed, but I still liked it.In Francis Ford Coppola's Mario Puzo's The Godfather, Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone, son of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), a famous family mafia. The film goes through their various escapades as a crime family.I really, really enjoyed watching The Godfather. The almost-three-hour runtime seemed to fly by. I was enthralled by the sincerity of the acting and the horrible true-to-life feel of the film. All of the acting was dead-on, although some of the screaming could have been a little better. With up-and-coming stars at the time such as Al Pacino, how can you go wrong?However, with all movies, they can't be perfect. The film could, or should, have had more plot to it. I know it's supposed to be 'a day in the life of' type movie, but if it had been with one adventure for most of the way it would have helped. Also, there were lots of supporting characters who we can't remember about for three hours. If that wasn't enough, all of the characters looked like either tall or fat white men with thick Italian accents, making them hard to understand (and of course I had to rent the VHS version so I couldn't read subtitles). More towards the end, I couldn't tell who was on whose side. The ending could have been trimmed down a little; the last half hour or so seemed to actually be boring and not very exciting. Maybe Coppola put it in there so the movie could have the designation of being 'one of those long classics'.I was surprised about how little strong language there was for a crime movie like this. I would have guessed all the characters to be swearin' like a sailor, but I was surprised. The amount of blood didn't surprise me, but I commend Coppola for putting so much in.Pacino looked like he does now, minus bags under his eyes. Brando gained about 200 pounds after The Godfather. And, Abe Vigoda looks exactly the same as he did thirty years ago. Yes, that's right. Abe Vigoda is in this movie. Hurray!The Godfather is an entertaining movie that is overrated but still fun to watch as three hours pass.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong violence, blood, brief nudity, and constant but mainly minor profanity.",7,5,12,16 November 2002
