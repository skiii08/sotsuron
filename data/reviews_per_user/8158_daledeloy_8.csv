The Ring," Great plot idea...ordinary thriller
","Before I saw this movie, everyone had been making a big deal about how scarythe movie is.  I thought, 'for once, a movie that will actually scare me!' Well... it did have great unexpecting events and situation that leave you almost offyour seat, but it was just like any other thriller movie.  So, my point being, it wasn't that scary people.The plot idea I thought was great.  And I also enjoyed the twist at the end of the movie.  The acting and setting were fine.  I will probably have this movie apart of my DVD collection, once it is released.  I give this movie B+.",8,0,0,4 January 2003
Minority Report," FANTASTIC!
","This movie was fantastic!  Great future setting and awesome idea!  Although,the plot is a little hard to follow during the movie, but is then easy to realize at the end.  The cast was brilliant and the acting was extraordinary!  I grade this movie and give it an A!",9,0,0,4 January 2003
Life Is Beautiful," Extraordinary!
","What I especially liked about this movie, was it freed the viewers from thehorrible barbaric reality of world war two and brings the viewers to show how one particular family deals with the torment.  It was brilliant how the Father helped his son, cope with the concentration camp torment (although his sonwas na√Øve about everything).  I graded this movie and gave it a B+.",8,2,4,4 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great but novel is unbeaten
","This movie was awesome but was disappointing to see some areas of the novel not in the film.  I realize that there are guidelines on how long films can be but I'm sure there were ways to adjust the film and have most of the book's events in the film.The actors are perfect for the movie and kept me entertained.  I still wish the movie was longer, which shows how good the film is!  This movie is good to watch anytime and I recommend watching this movie sometime.  I gave Harry Potter and theSorcerer's Stone 8/10.",8,0,0,15 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the first!
","All I have to say is if you liked first one, you will like this one!  I think this one was better than the first.  'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' had mostly all, if not all, the events in the novel shown in the movie.  I will have to give 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' 10/10!",10,0,0,29 November 2002
Signs," not what expected but good
","Watching the previews, I figured this would be a movie full of suspense andfrightening moments.  Well, only a few of those and sometimes I wondered ifcertain scenes are to frighten audiences, but did not.  It has a good plot but I feel that there could have been a lot more in 'Signs.'  Frankly, the aliens were not that frightening in my opinion and I am still a little disappointed that I never fully understood what the purpose of the aliens in 'Signs' was.  I give this movie a 7/10.",7,0,1,16 November 2002
The Wedding Singer," One of the best Adam Sandler films!
","'The Wedding Singer' is one of the best Adam Sandler films!  It is full ofcomedy and full of great actors/actresses.  Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandlerare the best choice for the two main roles in this film.  'The Wedding Singer' shows the joys, laughs, and sorrows of getting married.  I give this movie a B!",8,0,1,12 January 2003
Back to the Future," Positive remarks!
","What I especially liked about 'Back to the Future,' is that the events and time machine itself were original and were not too fiction.  I liked the idea that the time machine was made out of a DeLorean and looked homemade, rather than a detailed and 'perfect' time machine.  The conflict for the plot was creative and the actors were perfect for this film!  10/10!",10,1,2,27 January 2003
