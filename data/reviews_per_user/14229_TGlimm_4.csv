Come and See," most disturbing film about war crimes ever
","A very impressive film, and in my opinion the most emotionally disturbing film about Nazi war crimes during WW2. There is no moment of relief from the horrors of the war, no concessions where made as to ease the shock the viewer finds himself in throughout the whole movie. There is no greasy Hollywood sentimentality in this movie, it is even less propagandistic than your average Holocaust/War Blockbuster such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan etc. [There are though some maybe somewhat unfair scenes, f.ex. when the Waffen-SS soldiers start playing a Bavarian yodl-song when the killing of the inhabitants of the village starts. That is going too far.] All in all, a movie definitely worth watching, but hard to take.",Null,2,4,1 June 1999
Scarface," Some more cliches, anyone?
","Al Pacino gives a good performance in a movie cursed by cliches. Once you understand the principle of the movie (pack as much graphic cheapness in it as possible) it gets kind of boring. Then again, a lot of unintended comic is produced (eg -SPOILER- when Tony's sister tells him that she had just gotten married to Manolo - right after Tony shot the latter - what a coincidence! How, like, totally tragic!!)All in all, a truly pathetic movie, which kind of diminished my respect for Al Pacino's judgment a big deal. I mean, what's the point of a brilliant performance in a movie with such a catastrophe of a plot?My advice: As with any film with which Oliver Stone is associated, watch this movie as a comedy.",4,3,8,25 May 2000
Dark City," piece of crap - except for the looks
","A truly great looking movie, paying homage to Metropolis and Nosferatu. One of the most conventional and unimaginative scripts I've ever had to endure and truly weak acting make this film a waste of time, I am sorry to say. Avoid it and and rather watch Blade Runner one more time.",3,6,14,27 November 1999
The Evil Dead," Angst and Estrangement
","Forget about the scenes of grueling violence, the dismemberment of heavily bleeding zombies, the ultra-rapid decay of undead bodies at dawn - these are just the usual horror-flick gimmicks. What makes this movie a stunningly accomplished oeuvre is the powerful representation of existential angst - the estrangement of the individual from its environment, the epiphany of becoming aware of the fundamental gap between nature and the individual man, shown in incredibly powerful images in the last half an hour of the movie, when Ash feels that the house (being a symbol of his 'soul') is surrounded by an unseen, totally incomprehensible, yet omnipotent 'evil' (the 'absurd') : Everything has changed, nothing is as it was before, there is nothing familiar anymore, nothing to hold on to - this is the exposition of the feeling of the absurd in Camus' sense. Being restricted to a very small setting and cast of actors which gives the movie nearly the feeling of a play, the whole conception of the archaically simple plot is directed towards this last moment of total estrangement. I am very well aware that probably, Raimi just wanted to shoot an entertaining horror flick, but what he (probably unintentionally) accomplished is one of the most powerful displays of angst and estrangement in film history.",9,0,0,19 April 1999
