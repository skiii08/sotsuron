Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," your just a critic
","sorry to say, but you are merely a critic and not a film maker. Do you realiZe how DIFFICULT and long it takes to make a film? Every key aspect must be taken into consideration, problems solved, and with a bit of improv it comes out great. I love the movie base it was non-stop action, special effects were amazing, and the music was fantastic. EX: duel of fates. You are just a critic and not a famous filmmaker. Instead of criticizing a film, maybe you should actually watch it and be entertained for just a little second. The problem with you critics is that your never in the spot light and judge films based on the amount of money coming your way. For example, critics said BIG FAT LIAR was the best comedy of the year, funnier than RAT RACE, and absolutely amazing.....it was terrible.Sorry i forgot, what is your name? Oh never mind no body cares.",Null,1,2,21 May 2008
