Walk the Line," Seeing this movie once definitely not enough
","Fabulous movie with Reese and Joaquin playing exceptional parts. Amazing how both manage to do such a great job singing even tho neither were singers before this movie.Some say Reese outshines Joaquin, but remember in real life, June Carter was a larger than life person and Johnny Cash was a quiet, shy, man. They both did a fantastic job of making this an honest portrayal of their characters. Joaquin does an amazing job of expressing Johnny's spirit and raw talent and does not try to imitate but gives his own interpretation. His characterization is so believably real! I saw Johnny in Texas in 1956 along with Elvis and Jerry Lee. This was just on the verge of them becoming successful and known. It was a short time later that Elvis first appeared on Ed Sullivan. This was an amazing concert and one that will remain in my mind forever.I bought the sound track to this movie and appreciate it more and more with each listening. I will definitely buy the DVD when it is released. This is a movie that is worth watching many times more.Joaquin and Reese are definitely Oscar contenders!",10,0,2,22 November 2005
