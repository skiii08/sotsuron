First Man," Superb movie, the haters are wrong. : )
","I just saw this movie tonight and it was enthralling. It really gives you, in addition to a great story, the sense of having been there with Neil Armstrong through the high-flying events of his life and the Apollo 11 mission to land on the moon. It's a really enjoyable movie. For reasons, quite invalid, there are a lot of people hating on it. People have been obsessing over the several scenes where there is shaking in the cockpit, which added verisimilitude cinematically. There is a line in another work - 'People are focusing more on what they do wrong than what they do right!'. Nothing was done wrong in this movie, and it was done right, but people are obsessing over certain things like - though the American flag is all over this movie, on the side of the Apollo 11 Saturn 5 Rocket, and 3 shots of it planted into the moon next to the lunar module, and dozens of people waving American flags - people are obsessing that the specific shot of it being put into the moon isn't in the movie. We all know how the flag got put in the moon! And the movie is elaborately explicit that this was an American mission. So, these peculiar, petty criticisms are irrational. It's the 'One giant leap for . . . ' moment we all are looking forward to. Why obsess over the flag planting, people? It's in the movie, anyhoo, right there. The movie really works well as an enjoyable, entertaining, exciting drama-biographic story of Neil Armstrong's path to going to the moon and his family/the people he worked with on the way at NASA. It's a great tribute to an American hero and also our nation's highest technological achievement. Go see it, if you like heroes or space or adventure, etc. Ignore the hate. This is a big movie, like Apollo 13 and deserves well to be seen on the big screen, where it is way way more fun, and I know my iPhone or tv would never do justice to the big scope of what you see here! : )",10,2,6,4 November 2018
Sucker Punch," Superb Message, Superbly Done
","It was inspiring and refreshing to see a Man (Zack Snyder) go full out in praise of Individualism. This movie's final summed up abstract message, it's theme, is the strength of the Individual. It is all about messages like Freedom, you can do it, you are good enough to get what you want to do done, you are adequate, you as an individual, you are strong, you yourself have what you need to fight your battles in Life, you are strong enough to live as an individual entity, strong enough to be. That you can watch over yourself, you are sufficient to take care of yourself, you, you as you are are strong. Subtext being you, your individual mind is strong. In this day when the previews for this movie included movies about how we need other people to watch over us, and other such trash, Sucker Punch is a bold, laudatory tribute to each one of us, to the Individual, that I recommend to everybody!!!!! Concretely, the story is excellent, the action sequences look great and the actresses are keel over HEROIC GORGEOUS!!!!! Enjoy!!!!!!!",10,4,9,3 April 2011
Captain Marvel," Painfully Dull And Annoyingly Over-Hyped. Brute force does not a superhero make.
","I actually fell asleep in the movie theater at one point! And I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, and went into watching this with the usual great anticipation and hope. This one disappoints. It, unlike most of the MCU (or X-Men or even Fantastic 4) movies, lacks the 'magic' that makes a superhero movie work (an interesting character, intelligent writing, humor, joy, an interesting, original story). It starts off with the main character on an alien planet with her powers already - before we even know who she is, have any relationship with her, and should care why she is there. There is no character development, she is just dropped in our laps, and as the person I was with said - who is new to this character - she thought there was a big backstory available somewhere else. The desperately needed plot that proceeds is uninteresting, and ends up suddenly being centered around aliens on Earth we know even less about. There is no emotional center to the movie, no sense of a character arc or drama or stakes that matters. Just a lot of POW WHAM moments, that then get bigger, and we are expected to accept that as drama and 'the story'. The jokes are infantile, Jude Law's character is a cardboard villain, and Brie Larsen was poorly cast in this Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel role as she exhibits no characterization; she takes no joy in being Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, her Carol Danvers is painfully dull and seems to have no significant personal character herself, to genuinely be a dull person, who then becomes a dull superhero, but that she can glow and punch the movie makers force on the audience as the reason we are supposed to gormless-ly cheer her. Brute force does not a superhero make. This is why I actually momentarily fell asleep in the movie theater at one point. Unlike Iron Man, Black Widow, Black Panther, Bruce Banner, she has no * character story *. She is cardboard superhero that one would expect from someone who did not know how to make superhero movies, certainly not the gateway character to the next Phase in the MCU franchise. A further issue is that this character - never famous like the Hulk, etc from the comics because she isn't as originally interesting a character (not a dramatic character, not a scientist, not funny, not a strong personal character, not a person with a dramatic story or backstory, etc) - still had a character that was well fleshed out in the comic books. And could have been made with her existing material into something even better for the movie. Instead, the 5 (!) writers on the movie went with cliches, dropped the comic book base content and origin story and made a convoluted plot that just crashes and flops worse than the place crash in the movie. I have never been so disappointed in an MCU film. It's a shame, because this character certainly could have been great if handled by a better writer(s). It bodes badly for the MCU next Phase. What. a. dull, mindless, weak, lackluster, incompetent, over hyped, mis-made junk pile of a movie. : /",1,50,86,11 March 2019
Suicide Squad," What a lousy movie.
","What a lousy movie. Like an hour and a half of one dimensional characters, doing clichÃ©s. With really forced, sentimental sub-plots to make them seem more meaningful. All while doing obvious, stupid, overt violence. It is just sad, and I lost a lot of respect for Will Smith for doing this movie. All his characters - from the late Muhammad Ali to Agent J to Hancock were really good. Here it is all stupid violence from him, and literal evil. It made me sad to see this movie. Let's all hope there will never be a sequel. The world needs to be inspired right now (thank goodness for The Avengers and Superman and Sully the pilot and the new Spider-Man). Not given spectacles of heinous indecency and boring depravity.",1,5,9,13 August 2016
Logan," Spoilers Included - Horrible, a major disappointment. This movie is riddled with plot holes like Swiss cheese!!!
","Of all the X-Men, X-Men Origin and X-Men prequel movies, this movie is the worst, and separate from that - it is a bad movie, standing alone. Unlike the effective - in (X-Men director) Brian Singer's paraphrased words 'I would want my favorite comic book universe, if made into a movie, to be taken seriously' - other X-Men movies, this movie is filled with gratuitous violence, bizarre levels of cursing and a one-dimensional villain. I can't even remember the villain's name, that is how forgettable he was. Unlike Magneto or Colonel Striker, who were instantly memorable. We are told the movie takes place in the year 2029, but that makes no sense, since they keep repeating there have been no new mutants born in 25 years. Since 2004. But Prof. X's school was - I quote - taking place in the 'not too distant future' - and was filled with kids in all the prior movies!!! Which were clearly taking place during, before and after 25 years ago, by any clear judgment. It made no sense. We were informed that Prof. X and Logan were among the last alive, that all the other X-Men from the newly resurrected Jean Grey to Scott. But with no explanation, they are all now dead. The entire pantheon of the X-Men, dead, when in the last movie with them - Days Of Future Past - they were all at the top of their game. We never found out what happened to Rogue - who was alive - or Bobby or even flipping Beast! And for some bizarre, entirely inexplicable reason, in this movie the mighty Wolverine is trying to get by ... as a chauffeur. With a chauffeur's permit and everything. IMPLAUSIBLE, MUCH? This movie is riddled with plot holes like Swiss cheese!!! The movie has a double tragic death ending unbefitting the glory of these excellent characters. What a shame!!!",3,51,117,4 March 2017
