The Devil's Advocate," Great film regards 'Good vs. Evil'
","Well, I have to give some serious props to Keanu Reeves for finally learning how to act!!  Seems to be the first movie in which he learned how to...Mr. Pacino as the Devil?  FUN!  I did not find the film scary, but a fun fantasy'ish 'What If?'  Has anyone else out there read the Piers Anthony series, 'Incarnations of Immortality?'  This movie is along those lines... so people need not take this movie so seriously!Also, I really like movies about the apocalypse and the devil and 'Good vs. Evil,' so this was right up my alley!!  ENJOY!!!",9,1,1,14 April 2003
Crash," This Movie is for the Ethnically Challenged...
","Sadly, this movie was made for non-ethnic people to make them feel like they understand ethnic issues. It's contrived, it's poorly put together, and it was a complete waste of an amazing ensemble cast.Don't waste your time. There are other movies that deal with ethnic issues much better... go watch something like Grand Canyon instead or Angels in America. Even 'Higher Learning' had for in terms of real cultural issues. Don't pretend that the backdrop of 9/11 made this movie more profound... that's just a false pretense to make this movie seem deeper than it is.-z",1,18,33,13 January 2006
American History X," This scene makes me cringe...
","SPOILER!!!!This was such a great film... however, it made me a bit wary about wandering around the neighborhood of Venice Beach for awhile though!Ed Norton is phenomenal, as per usual.  But holy crap!!!, that head-cracking scene was vicious!!!  I cringe just thinking about it.This film was so good, it is a must in for a collector.",10,0,0,12 April 2003
Resident Evil," A pretty damn good port of a Video Game...
","You know... it's always hard for fans of one media watch their beloved characters/story line be warped into the big screen.So many comic books turned film have been God-awful... The Punisher, Captain America, Superman, Batman... they never captured the essence of the comic book.  We needed a director like Martin Scorsese to direct Batman.  The good thing is, films based off of comic books have finally come of age with the coming of Spider-Man, X-Men... and hopefully The Hulk.Video games turned films seem to just be in it's infancy.  We had Super Mario Bros.  Ugh.  Street Fighter?  Ouch (RIP, Raul Julia... that should not have been your last film)!  But hey, Resident Evil wasn't bad!!  And look, Silent Hill is on the horizon!!  I think video game films will only get better and better from here!!Besides, Milla looked great in this flick!",8,0,0,12 April 2003
Hero," The Hero, once again...
","In the 70's, the best martial arts film was 'Shao Lin Tzu (Shao-Lin Temple).'In the 80's, the best martial arts film was 'Shao Lin Xiao Zi (Shao-Lin Kids).'In the 90's, the best martial arts film was 'Wong Fei-Hung (Once Upon a Time in China).' Well, maybe 'Fong Sai-Yuk.' And also 'Tai Ji Zhang San Feng (Tai-Chi Master).' As well as 'Jing Wu Ying Xiong (Fist of Legend).'In the 00's... 'Ying Xiong (Hero).'Get it? Li Lian Jie rocks... he's the master.",9,0,0,12 April 2003
X2: X-Men United," FANBOY EXCITEMENT! And Rant...
","SPOILERS!!!!!PHOENIX is back??  X3??  Are we gonna see Dark Phoenix as well?Lady Deathstrike... why did you have to die?Hank McCoy on the news!!!  Where's Beast?Isn't Sebastian Shaw part of the Hellfire Club?  Since when was he a doctor?And lastly Colossus... how hard would it have been for this kid to learn a Russian accent?  I didn't like the fact he sounded like a corn fed white boy.WOOHOO!!  Nightcrawler!  I always thought Jeff Goldblum would be the only actor that could play him, but Alan Cummings, you rock.When will it be revealed that Rogue and Mystique are mother daughter?Hey!  How about getting John Woo to direct an X-Men?!?!",10,0,0,12 May 2003
True Romance," What's NOT to like about this flick?!?
","OK... you have the GREAT dialog of Quentin Tarantino, Christian Slater in the BEST role of his life, Dennis Hopper playing a compassionate man with balls of steel, Gary Oldman being scarily phenomenal, Val Kilmer playing ANOTHER rock star, Brad Pitt being himself, James Gandolfini prepping for the Soprano's, Patricia Arquette playing a sexy Southern gal steered wrong, Chrispher Walken the Sicilian n*gger, Bronson Pinchot finally breaking free of Balkey, Sam Jackson getting his ass-whooped, etc. etc...Doesn't that sound fun???",10,0,3,12 April 2003
