Alien 3," What's the matter with you guys? This film is great!
","Alien was an excellent film. Aliens was good too, but it's a completely different movie. While Alien was a film about one alien hunting human, Aliens was a film about umpteen humans hunting umpteen aliens - pure no-brainer action.This film goes back to the roots of the series, and has Ripley & co. fighting one single alien. Once again it's more like the alien is hunting the humans than the humans hunting the alien, the way it's supposed to be. Now they even have to defend themselves against the alien without weapons... This film is much more frightening than the second Alien movie, and is a very good film by David Fincher. It deserves more and better credit. And the ending is breathtaking and excellent!This film has about everything; great story, great suspense, great acting and a great ending. The only thing not so great is the music, seeming a bit bombastic at times...8/10",8,0,4,17 August 2000
Catch Me If You Can," A welcome departure from Spielberg's usual style
","This is the story of perhaps the biggest American fraudster in history, and the cat-and-mouse chase to catch him. A hunt that in many ways brought Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) and FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Hanks) together, since in many ways they were each other's lives at the time, and culminated in a lifelong friendship. Frank Abagnale Jr.'s story is an incredible one. By the time he turned 18, he had successfully played the roles of an airline captain, a doctor and a lawyer, and cashed in false checks for over $2.5 million. This is the film of his story, based on Frank's own accounts of the events. And it is an exceptionally entertaining film. Cocky con artists succeeding pretty much always make for a fun film, and when it's based on the true events of a young and likable man, it gets even more fun. It's amazing what you can get away with a little ingenuity and enormous amounts of nerve. But there's of course a price to pay when your whole life revolves around living a lie.Catch Me If You Can is actually a rather unusual film to bear Spielberg's name. The usual Spielberg trademarks are mostly absent from this film, without that necessarily being a bad thing. Initially Spielberg didn't intend to direct this film at all; it was Gore Verbinsky who first got the job. But when Leonardi DiCaprio was called back to film more scenes for Gangs of New York, delaying the shoot, Verbinsky had to withdraw. At that time James Gandolfini was lined up for the role of Carl Hanratty. It could've been interesting to see how the film had turned out with them, but looking at the film as it is, it is hard to imagine it being better than the Spielberg/Hanks collaboration it turned out to be, their fifth at the time.Along with Spielberg's departure from his usual style, there's also John William's soundtrack, which is very different from the pompous soundtracks he's most known for. It's jazzy and beautiful, and fits the 60s setting perfectly. The acting is first rate, from the leads of Leonardo DiCaprio, who started showing at the time that there was more to him than just being a heartthrob, and Tom Hanks, both delivering top notch work, to brilliant supporting parts from actors like Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. It's a well crafted and playful movie overall, delivering the goods across all lines. It's a highly entertaining movie, that I'm sure will stand the test of time. Recommended!",8,3,4,9 September 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," Not what I was hoping for
","After reading the rave reviews this title has gotten everywhere lately, I must color myself a bit confused. Didn't anyone notice the extremely poor camera work in the action sequences throughout? Didn't anybody else get bored along the way in the way overlong chase sequences that seemed to dominate about half the movie? Didn't anyone else cringe at the lack of reality in some of the key action sequences in the film? Especially since the two first movies were far above the Hollywood par in this respect. Didn't anybody else notice the rather lackluster acting from most of the central 'bad guys', probably due to their rather pointless characters, obviously written into the script to make the plot's obvious farfetchedness seem less far-fetched? Breaking it down I'd say the action sequences are utterly disappointing throughout. Story wise the first half is rather dull, with very little driving the plot forwards. The second half is a lot better, when things finally start to entangle. Ultimately the ending sums things quite nicely up for the whole Bourne trilogy. Then again, the series could well have ended with the nice, open ended, ending of 'The Bourne Supremacy' too, and be all the better for it... There certainly doesn't need to be any more sequels in this franchise! Without a doubt the weakest link in the trilogy, but I have to admit it's not all bad. Especially the second half makes the film watchable. Still - it's not what it could, and should, have been, and I really don't see where all the praise from other users and critics are coming from. This is most certainly not one of the 250 best movies ever made (ref. it's #84 on the IMDb Top 250 at the time I'm writing this comment), let alone the best in the Bourne series. I feel kind of nice when giving it a 6/10. That's my first impression, anyway.",6,0,5,14 September 2007
Pitch Black," Pretty good
","One of the best sci-fi films lately. This one has a good story with many interesting and unexpected twists and turns in the plot. The cast are also doing good performances, and it's very nice to see new faces doing good performances. It's also nice to see that a film with all new faces isn't completely ignored by the movie-goers.The special effects are also great. So, I liked this film in many ways. The story, acting and special effects were good enough to minimize the damage director David Twohy was doing to the film. The camera work and/or cutting of the film is terrible. In some of the action scenes it's impossible to understand what's happening because the camera focuses on anything but the action and only make you dizzy...Anyway, this film is well worth the while, and I recommend it to any sci-fi fan. 7/10!",7,0,0,13 February 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Even better in special edition
","If you can find a special edition of this movie (T1000 or Director's Cut) - see it! The films gets a whole new meaning, and becomes much greater than it originally was. And that makes me ask why, oh why, was the scenes cut out in the first place? Fortunately James came to his senses and did an improved version!I've seen the same thing with his movies ALIENS and THE ABYSS, and now I hear that also TITANIC has some great scenes cut out. WHY? Why not make these masterpieces as good as they can be at once?",9,1,1,23 May 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Spielberg's worst movie?
","Warning: possible spoilers!I loved the original Jurassic Park (have seen it about 15 times now), so when I heard they were making a sequel I was exited. When I saw the movie on the cinema I realized quickly that it wasn't as good as the first, but I still enjoyed it quite much. The excitement of the very being of a sequel completely made me overlook the fact that the film was complete and utter crap.When I later saw the film on video I started to realize that this is actually one of Steven Spielberg's worst films ever. The directing has many obvious mistakes, and the actors and actresses are all acting in a way showing all of their bad sides, and none of their good. The sequence where the T-Rex is running around in the streets is one of the most lame sequences I've ever seen, and at times it almost becomes funny because it is so terribly terribly bad.The first hour of the film is extremely boring and hardly anything happens, the second hour has more action but it's way too silly. And the film if full of giant plot holes. Like for instance: if the baby T-Rex was brought to the city by helicopter, and mother T-Rex in a cargo ship; how did the crew of the cargo ship get eaten, when the T-Rex was obviously firmly secured in the ships cargo compartment when the ship arrived?All considered: this film is terrible, and not recommendable. I'll give it a 4 out of 10.And now I hear they're making a third installment to the series. Call me strange, but I'm actually looking forward to it. Why? Because they're replacing several of the crew members. New director, new musician, new producers (except Spielberg, who's still going to executively produce) and so on. And they've signed Sam Neill to star once again as Dr. Grant. It was he who brought the first movie to greatness, hopefully he'll do the same thing for the third. I also hope we'll see more of Joseph Mazzello (Tim), who's a very talented young actor, and maybe also the sister Lex, played by Ariana Richards, even though they've now both grown up... The third film can't possibly be worse than this one, anyway, so I'm exited!",5,1,4,13 July 2000
Elysium," Another disappointment from Neill Blomkamp
","South African director Neill Blomkamp was discovered by New Zealand director Peter Jackson a few years ago, and he so believed in this director that he produced his first big movie, District 9. Having been a fan of Peter Jackson since well before his step up to the big league, through the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was optimistic about District 9; if Peter Jackson believed in it, it had to have some promise. That's what I thought, anyway. Ultimately I was severely disappointed by District 9, which in boring documentary style explored the treatment of aliens in South Africa, seen through the eyes of a character no one cared about, watching characters we didn't know enough about to care. The underlying message; this is how rich people treat the poorest of the poor. The message is a good one, the execution extremely poor.Fast forward to 2013, and we have his second big film at the theaters. Without Peter Jackson as a producer this time, but instead he has attracted big stars like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster to the film. Matt Damon playing Max; a poor, unfortunate orphan on earth, struggling in a low pay, high risk job, hoping to save up enough money one day to take him and his childhood girlfriend to the haven in the sky; the off-world, man built colony called Elysium, where only the rich and beautiful are allowed to live. An accident at work gives him only 5 days to carry out his dream, and to be saved by the health beds on Elysium, which can cure any illness in seconds, without any side effects what so ever. To assist him he gets a group of rebels who on a semi-regular basis sends their own spaceships up to Elysium with fugitives who've saved up enough money for the ticket. On Elysium, chief of security Delacourt (Jodie Foster) does everything in her power - and more - to prevent them from landing.Once again it seems that Blomkamp is more interested in conveying a message than actually delivering a good, coherent sci-fi/action epic. The message this time; the rich consider themselves elevated over the poor, and do not want anything to do with them. While this certainly rings true in today's society, no one watching a movie presented as a big star sci-fi/action epic really cares. So, as far as conveying a message goes, Blomkamp once again fails. Unfortunately his failure also extends to his ability to convey a good action movie.The characters aren't fleshed out enough for the audience to really care. Jodie Foster is a great actress, but she seems badly miscast in the role of rogue security officer, planning to overtake the presidency. It's sad to see her struggling her way through this movie, in what is probably the worst performance I've ever seen her give. South African actor Sharlto Copley, who also got a slight break with District 9, is certainly the most entertaining of the characters, but the movie fails hugely in his credibility - we lack the background information to make his place in the movie believable. Matt Damon plays pretty much on auto pilot, and that works well enough to get him through the movie. His character Max and his girlfriend Frey are given some background information through some scenes from their childhood - scenes that are repeated annoyingly many times as a reminder of what we've already seen. Yet when it comes to their adult versions, we are given no background between then and now at all, ultimately failing even there to make the characters fleshed out enough to be believable.To top it off, every action sequence in the movie are filmed using a fast paced camera following the action. The problem with that is that the 24 pictures per second that film is able to convey is not enough to make the motion fluid. In other words, all action sequences are shaky and blurry, making it hard to follow what's actually happening. At the end of the movie I also had a bit of a headache, which I didn't at the beginning. I don't know why this type of action filming has become so popular, because I can't remember ever hearing of anyone actually preferring this type of filming over more steady and fluent presentations of the action on screen. But when it comes to effects it might be cheaper to present them in a blurry way, than having to flesh out all the details in proper action sequences...The movie's vision of the future is an interesting one, though, and the presentation of 2154's Earth isn't really too far fetched as of now. However the presentation of Elysium leaves far more questions than answers, and does not seem credible at all.At the end of the day I sat through a movie with a disappointingly simple story, with disappointing and non-credible characters, and with an ever more disappointing ending yielding even more questions than answers. Blomkamp shows once again that his ability to create entertaining sci-fi/action movies is non-existent. Does he have a message in his movie? Who cares? If he wanted to really address the problems of society of today he should do it through proper documentaries, or even contemporary big star action movies with the message up front and clear, instead of what he does now, which is failing at entertaining and failing at conveying messages. So for those who've read through this review and not seen the movie; don't bother with it.",3,5,10,24 August 2013
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," As good as the first one - but that's my opinion
","This film is exactly the same as the first one, only with a different setting and different characters. It's a matter of opinion which version of the story you prefer. Personally I prefer this one, with Brenda Fricker doing an excellent performance as the pigeon woman and Tim Curry hilarious as the Hotel Manager. It's more in touch with the Christmas spirit than the first one too.Forget that the bad guys takes much more beating than anyone would survive, just sit down and enjoy it! Forget everything, and let the movie build up a good Christmas feeling! This movie has much more chance of doing so than the first one! I give it a 7/10!",8,0,0,18 December 2000
The Thin Red Line," This movie sucks!!!
","Expecting a new 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Platoon', 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Apocalypse Now' I went to see this movie in Tromsø, Norway. I came out of the cinema really disappointed. This movie was all a war movie should NOT be.Sure, some of the war scenes were brilliant, but that's also all the good this movie has accomplished.My list of complaints about this movie is quite long. First of all: those voiceovers! Whatever is the meaning of putting them there? Sure they have an important message to convey, but when they were put in as voiceovers the way they were, I almost fell to sleep during them. I think it would have been better putting the messages in as text on the screen, subtitles or scrolling text over the screen.Then you have the music. THIS IS A WAR MOVIE! Get the point! It's NOT 'Back To Howard's End' or 'The Age Of Innocence'! So the music in the film is really malplaced! That's one thing. Another thing is that it's there EVERY second of the film. I can't remember ONE second without music in the movie. And that's NOT a plus for a war movie. In a war movie you need scenes without music to meditate over what you've just seen. The music is also repetitive and boring. Some places it seems to be at the end of a sequence, and then it starts repeating itself over and over again. If you didn't fall asleep during the last voiceover, you might fall to sleep during the endless repetitions of the terribly malplaced, boring and repetitive music.Third: the actors. The men who fight in wars are your regular John Doe's such as you and me. Not your regular celebrities as George Clooney, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte and Sean Penn. A war movie gains on using smallname actors, they give a more realistic story when the soldiers are people you don't recognize just like that. In fact this is the only bad thing I found about 'Saving Private Ryan' too, they should've never used Tom Hanks in that movie.Apart from being bigname actors, they don't do their parts too well either. This move would have gained much on using talented, yet unknown actors. Someone the public was NOT familiar with.That's enough said about this film. In short: it has a great story and great war scenes. But it's terribly made, with wrong actors, horrible music, and voiceovers straight out of hell. And when a 3-hour movie gets this boring because of that: it sucks! 3/10 is all it gets from me... And everyone I've talked to about this movie agrees with me...",3,0,0,23 May 1999
Contact," This film has 11 minutes of disappointment...
","... otherwise it's great.This film is a great sci-fi film, and I look at it as probably the most realistic sci-fi film ever made. Something like this actually could happen! Although not likely, and it would be highly coincidental...The film is perfect all the way, except for the 11 minute travel/encounter sequence. That sequence actually destroys everything, it doesn't fit in and the encounter wears very thin and is more sickening than interesting! The film would be much more interesting, and mysterious if we, the audience, saw the same thing as everyone around Ellie saw, and not what Ellie saw. Then it would be her word against our (and all the other characters in the film) faith. That way we would actually have to think, and to make up our own mind about what happened; Did nothing happen, as the characters around Ellie thinks, or did she actually encounter with the aliens?What they really should do is to make sort of a Mystery Edition of the film, completely eliminating the 11 minute travel sequence. Such an edition would make the perfect sci-fi film, one causing you to actually think...",9,0,1,23 May 2000
