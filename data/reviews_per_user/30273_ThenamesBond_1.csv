Black Swan," What a disappointment, save for the music...
","This film was something Ken Russell would have knocked out in the 70s and probably done a better job;(cf 'The Music Lovers). I've waited a long time to see it and can only say it was over-rated and hyped beyond belief. The only saving grace was the music. It didn't seem to know what it wanted to be, soft porn (ie the lesbian scene); schlock horror (cgi spooky mirror and random dripping blood scenes); serious art house; who knows, it's a complete mish-mash of ideas. If you want passion in music and dance, go no further than Carlos Saura's 'Carmen', a flamenco interpretation of Bizet's famous opera, where jealousies and rivalries consume all, and life begins tragically to imitate art. So sorry, Peter Illych Tchaikovsky, you've been better served on the big screen than 'Black Swan'.",2,2,4,1 October 2011
