Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not the Second Coming, but a solid movie!
","If you are expecting The Best Movie Ever Made, this isn't it. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It got off to a bit of a slow start, but I think it does a good job of setting up the whole series. Lots of cameos of future characters for the obsessive fans, action for all, and a decent story. I'll see it again after the crowds thin out a bit.",8,5,7,19 May 1999
Toy Story 2," Absolutely the tops!
","Saw this with my 9-year-old nephews and we all loved it. Just as many laughs, chills and sly inside jokes as its predecessor. One of the *very* few movies in 1999 that I will see more than once. You will love it!",9,1,2,20 November 1999
