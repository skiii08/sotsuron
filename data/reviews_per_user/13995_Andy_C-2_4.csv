Alien 3," Give it some credit!
","After the euphoria of Aliens, many people felt let down by Alien3, due toa) most actors were British b) there was only 1 alien c) people wanted lots of aliensHowever I think this is a really atmospheric movie, far better than Alien Resurrection for example. It's also the most wince-inducing film, with some great killings, not to mention a post-mortem and scenes of needle injections. For those who haven't seen the movie I won't spoil it, but the basic premise is that an alien managed to stow away on board the spaceship at the end of Aliens, and when Ripley and co. crash on to the planet of Fury 161, the alien predictably wreaks havoc. There is also a twist in the tail regarding Ripley, which is fairly predictable from the first half hour or so, but it at least sets up the plot for Alien4. There are several well known British actors (well known to British people that is) such as Charles Dance and Brian Glover, and their broad, distinctive English swearing gives the film an added authenticity. Give the film the credit it deserves.",Null,1,3,29 September 1999
Alien," Suspense from start to finish
","In its time this was the most original sci-fi flick for years, I have never waited with so much anticipation for a movie to appear on TV. The plot is well known - a spacecraft picks up a distress call and the crew are awoken from hypersleep to investigate. What they find of course is a nasty little SOB alien that takes on the crew single-handed (clawed?). An excellent cast, my only complaint when I view the film now is the rather mumbled dialogue, giving the impression that some of it was ad-libbed. Most of the actors are well known; Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt for instance. Ironically it was the relative newcomer Sigourney Weaver who became the biggest star. More or less a ghost story set in outer space - in that something scary is attacking people, but we never quite see it until the end. Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,29 September 1999
Predator," slightly disappointing
","Predator could have been slightly better. The appearance of the alien in his rubber suit is a big let-down, and some of the deaths could have been more graphic. That said, the movie is highly original and exciting. Arnie leads a group of soldiers into the jungle to rescue some VIPS, only to find themselves being picked off by an unknown, unseen presence. Once most of the cast has been killed, Arnie and the creature fight to the death. The predator is capable of invisibility (more or less) and has an impressive array of weapons which are used to lethal effect.I first saw this on video in about 1990, hiring it out without really knowing anything about the film. When I watched it I have to admit I was intrigued that a straightforward jungle movie could turn into a Sci-Fi thriller. It's undemanding but worth a look.",Null,0,1,8 October 1999
Scream," Stylish and full of surprises
","This is the movie that made I Know What You Did Last Summer look like the complete turkey that it undoubtedly was. Scream is a clever, slick, inventive slasher from beginning to end, with an absolutely riveting first 15 minutes where one of the famous actresses of the film finds herself in a life-or-death situation with the killer.During the film, you begin to suspect almost every cast member of being the killer, due to something that they say or do, but the identity of the person or persons responsible isn't revealed until a fair number of the cast have been hacked to death. The plot is as follows. Someone is dressing up in a gown and scary mask and is killing people. Sounds dull as hell but don't you believe it! This is a tremendous re-invention of the slasher genre, which has (and will) spawn numerous inferior sequels.There are plenty of surprises along the way, such as how many cameos you can spot. Linda Blair and Wes Craven both appear, and although famous actors Drew Barrymore and Henry Winkler are in the cast, they don't actually take up too much on-screen time. It's the lesser known Neve Campbell and David Arquette who take the acting honours. The only one I wasn't sure about was Courtenay Cox who wasn't wholly convincing as a reporter.All told this is one of the best horror movies of the 1990's.",Null,0,0,4 October 1999
