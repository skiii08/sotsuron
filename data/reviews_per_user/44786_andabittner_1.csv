Marie Antoinette," Wonderful
","This is a wonderful movie. Sophia Coppola delivers another beautiful introspective film. If you appreciated the understated under-dialogued 'lost in translation' you will love this film. The history buffs may scream bloody murder but let them. The historical setting is a minor annoyance used to give the film structure while the real film is about illuminating Kirsten Dunst as Marie in every aspect of her pampered world. Sophia uses the setting of 18th century France and the character of Marie Antoinette to film an ethereal beauty of great character existing in a world of dream like lavishness and manicured perfection. Sophia clearly chose the project because, like 'L I T' you are left with a feeling of both wanting more and angst, as you really did just miss a wonderful time up on the screen. The raw rock n roll music is a mostly spot on, but occasionally seems a little forced onto some of the more serious scenes. All in all a true delight and a breath of fresh air in the formulaic world of 21st century film making.",9,3,6,24 October 2006
