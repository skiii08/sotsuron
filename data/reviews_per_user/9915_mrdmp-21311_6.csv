First Man," Over hyped garbage
","First man is a long, boring and uneventful movie that doesn't know what it wants to be. It goes between a bio pix about Armstrong's life and then space exploration, however fails miserably at both.
I did not think it was possible for a movie to be worse than mamma Mia 2- but I was wrong. This is without a doubt, the worst movie of 2018. Ignore what critics
Are saying- it's a snooze fest!",1,13,22,27 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Mediocre at best
","I do not understand the hype around this film. It has an uneventful storyline with a horrendous soundtrack.
Bradley Cooper, who I usually like as an actor, mumbles through the entire movie with many of his lines inaudible. Gaga's acting is c grade at best and their chemistry as a couple isn't believable at all.
It was shot in such a way I wasn't convinced that Ally actually rose to fame, one minute she's releasing a song, the next she's some super star and receiving a Grammy. The whole thing was messy.
Over hyped film that does not deserve the buzz it's getting. It certainly is not deserving of Oscar talk!",1,7,15,20 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Over rated and over long.
","This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot.
Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best.",1,123,229,29 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Unneeded film
","This added nothing to the legacy of Toy Story. Toy story 3 wrapped up the series nicely, this was boring and detracted from the film's that preceded it. A waste.",2,140,253,23 June 2019
The Lion King," Shouldn't have made this
","This film's CGI is incredible and very well done. While this is the strength of the movie, it is also its weakness. So much effort was put into making the animals realistic and matching the plot of the story that there was no emotion, personality or umph in the animal's facial expressions or voice work. This stripped the humour and elements that made the original movie amazing.
The songs lacked interest and excitement. They were all a snooze fest! And the new songs, particular that one by Beyonc√© are just awful! Awful!
I went in with high hopes but left disappointed!",2,34,52,18 July 2019
La La Land," One of the world's worst movies
","I watch a lot of movies and are fairy easy to please but to say a movie is outstanding or terrible, it really has to be amazing or woeful. La la land is a pile of steaming sh_t that is the most tragic boring and uninspired piece of cinema.
I only last half of the film and has to leave- it was pathetic!",1,4,7,12 January 2019
