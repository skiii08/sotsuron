Hereditary," Have they all lost their heads????
","SPOILERS!'!'
Film started off OK because you aren't sure where this is heading, but goes downhill big time. Think Rosemary's Baby, but not nearly in that same class. Enough with the witch covens and sacrifices already... it's been DONE to death. The only true horror scare is the scene driving to the hospital but even that is derivative of the Final Destination movies. I won't waste your time writing about the plot. I am reviewing this as s WARNING!!! SEE! THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK OF BEING VERY DISAPPOINTED. If you need to see some real scare horror films, See the org. HAUNTING, THE SHINING, IT (TV MINI SERIES) except for the ending, The THING (1980's ver.) ALIEN etc. and scores of others. 
This film will be forgotten 10 mins. after leaving the theater.
Have the film makers lost their heads? Yes, and most of the cast too... No kidding!",1,84,169,10 June 2018
Knowing," Kowing was a great disappointment !!!
","I will keep this brief...I will not comment in length about this film as it doesn't deserve it.At least Mr. Cage's 'Treasure' films, like the Indiana Jones adventure series was somewhat tongue & cheek, this movie is dead serious, and so full of flaws I do not know where to begin. I will just say this......Though the first half of the movie was at least suspenseful, the predictable and overdone ending ruined any merits this film may have had. The basic premise of the film was plagiarized from a few eps. of the TV series, 'The X Files' and those who followed the series know exactly which eps. I mean. However, THAT was the GOOD part. The ending was such was virtually the same, and had the same message as 'Close Encounters', 'Contact', and among many others, the recent remake of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' We have seen the same ending per se in scores of SiFi films and we don't need it beaten into out heads again and again....******SPOILERS******> > > The scene where the two children are shown on a distant planet, supposedly to start the human race over again was problematic in itself... We see the two children running in fields of wheat(?) and we see other 'pods' containing it seems other children landing in the distance...Call me a fool, but here are some questions that I do not understand, and it wrecked the movie for me...With the alien spaceships the size of the state of Texas, why did they have to gather up the children by twos, each in their own pods? YES, along with the rabbits, I did understand the allusion to Noah's ark, TWO BY TWO..but come on...that is such a waste of spaceships..Or...another thought...were the children somehow paired up by the aliens? This is TOO freaky.. !!!So..the little boy and girl barely 10 years old are selected to be mated in order to populate their new planet? Is that the Utopian future for our kids...to be selected into a predetermined 'marriage' like the children of the LDS church, or Hindu and Muslim sects that believe in pre-arranged marriage?Sorry...I rather they were burnt to a crisp... And to be taken away from their parents??? What..there were no adults on the entire planet Earth worth saving?Which brings me to another point. Are the children to be left to their own devices, and possibly revert to 'Lord of the Flies' mentality? Or are we to believe that the kindly aliens will see to their every need?The children are still human, no alien agenda or influence can change that. No alien can guide into adulthood, a human child anymore than we should attempt to modify the lives of the mountain gorillas.Another passing thought.IF the spaceships are Noah's ark(s) and the planet the new Garden of Eden, the boy and the girl the new Adan and Eve, then it is still an implausible senerio that makes me want to gag... The scene in CONTACT where Jody Foster meets the alien who is the visage of her dead father was schmaltzy, but at least it made sense...Give me a break!!! I could write a few more pages about specifics, but I think that I have given enough examples to warn off any lover of good science fiction from this drivel...Post Script: I originally typed this without reading any other reviews. Now, having read a bunch, I can see that I am not alone in the comments I made, nor in my condemnation of one of the worst SiFi flicks of all time.",5,3,8,6 April 2009
1917," Saving Private Ryadn WWI style
","Well shot and acted. Some scenes look a bit phony or surreal, especially those shot in the town at night.
Basically a rehash of a one minded plot like Prvt.Ryan but to my taste, not as well done and not as interesting.
People that say the film puts you into the battle, but so did Prvt. Ryan, Dunkirk, and a slew of other war movies.
Yes, very few movies about WWI but after All Quiet on the Western Front, you don't need any more.
Remember, this was a ridiculous war based on alliances, not a war to save mankind from a lunatic mass murderer.
The leaders of Germany and England were cousins, daughters of each other's royal family.
The reason very few movies are made about The Great War is that it shouldn't have happened in the first place.
Most historians agree that it would have been better if Germany won the war. If the Germans won, Europe would not have changed drastically, but the reparations that Germany was forced to sign at the Treaty of Versailles led to the rise of Hitler and Nazism and might have never taken place.
The the first 'modern war' the Great War was the last gasp of Victorians. the war to end all wars still has negative reverberations today and it was a shame millions had to die for nothing.
That is the biggest blunder of history. The WAR and this film both never had to happen.",6,2,7,27 January 2020
Children of Men," The Worst SiFi film ever made (Inc. Beast from Yucca Flats)
","Maybe I should have read the book... This was absolutely the worst SF film I have ever seen!! The movie was just a set up for the director's shove it up your ass, political agenda. Yeah, I get all the overblown allegory to the problems of today, but not only was it heavy handed, but a first year film student could have made a better film. Here are just SOME of the reasons: Even if you take everything on faith, SOME background must be given as to the WHY of everything or the viewer can't be engaged. Esp. in SiFi, the story must be somewhat plausible. In the film, we are never told what happened 18 years ago to make the world what it had become. Forget about the infertility, what happened to the US? It is a much larger and stronger democracy than Britain. Who the hell are the Fish, why do they hate the gov.? I can understand the plight of the fugitives, but how did so many foreigners get into England in the first place? It's a fucken island for god sakes! Why would England let them all in, only to put them all in deportation/detention camps? In some scenes, the Londoners go about their business like it's just another sunny day, in others its Baghdad or Belfast to the 10th power! ON a lonely back country road, the car was ambushed, but some how the authorities have PHOTOS of who was in the car! Give me a break. How did the Fish find out where Jasper lived? How did they just happen to find Theo and Kee in the most chaotic crowded of circumstances? Did they have a transponder up Theo's ass? Why does everyone want the baby? Sure, for political reasons, but at least, why would Theo and Kee be so afraid of the Brt gov.? Was Kee supposed to be a fugi? She sure seemed British to me. If it was because it was a black baby, which they said would irk the white establishment, then why were the soldiers so reverent when the baby appeared during the fighting? And could the fight scenes be a more blatant attempt to draw a parallel to the Iraq war? The BAD westerners, oppressing the poor civilians, and the heroic insurgents! I almost choked when I saw the shots of the Arabs marching down the streets with their Arabic banners and machine guns. Yeah, I GET IT. And the best of all is to throw into the mix...the most horrible thing to confront mankind...GLOBEL WARMING!!! Did Al Gore fund this film? Every real scientist knows that though there is a cyclic warming trend, however, not nearly as severe as Mr. Gore would lead you to believe, mankind is NOT the primary cause (and I don't want to get in to a debate here..If you want the truth ask the founder of GRENPEACE among scores of other non-agendized scientists) But to somehow blame global warming for only the next 20 year to virtually put civilization in to chaos????????????? I could go on and on but you get the point. It was a confusing, and purposely vague plot, devised only to get a cross another 'you have been warned' agenda. (If you don't believe ME, listen to the commentaries and short extra material on the DVD) Yes, I know many Sifi films have a warning message for mankind, but THIS movie was SO agendized that it made me want to puke. I'd rather watch the 911 conspiracy film, or Michael Moore's trash, because at least they are up front about their beliefs and don't have to hide behind the guise of a SiFi movie!",1,2,8,3 April 2007
Mama," What The Heck Was Mama..?? After 2 hrs. I still don't Know!!
","***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT...ENDING REVEALED****I WARNED YOU!!!!OK, if you are a pedophile who likes to see little girls dressed mostly in pajamas for about 90% of the film, then you won't be disappointed...BUT..if you are a horror fan...I, like many others, felt cheated, as this could have been a great film.. I won't repeat the plot..read the other reviews, I will just tell you why this movie misses the mark. As others said, this was developed from a short film and it shows... After the creepiness factor and BOO scares are out of the way (and I will admit here that the kids, esp. in the beginning were very creepy) it really is a very simple and thin story line. Like Pans Labyrinth (a vastly superior film) the plot teeters on the edge of a horror film and a fairy tale (albeit. a Grimm style tale) not quite knowing which to be.Even though horror films are fantasies, I like at least a modicum of believability in the story line, of course within the genre. (a very good example of a pure 'ghost story' would be the 1970's film 'Ghost Story' with Fred Astaire and a big name cast) First, there is a very sketchy background story, which at least I don't know what the director was trying to say. Was the mad lady who took the baby (eventually becoming the ghost/monster) the REAL mother, or did she just snatch any old baby from the nun's hands? Was the mad woman even a ghost at all? At times she seemed more a Earth spirit than a ghost, and HOW did she become this way? The psychologist seemed to know, but HIS AH HAH moment is not ours to know. He vaguely refers to the sign outside the cabin, but we never know what it means...(another reviewer said it meant Switzerland...SO...??)Also, the entity called Mama was much scarier when in the shadows..once revealed...it was pathetic.. FILM MAKERS TAKE NOTE..the truly great horror films leave much to the imagination which is far scarier..the unseen is always better than the seen. Example. The best 'ghost story' on film IMOP was the 60's film 'The Haunting' with Julie Harris...you never see ANYTHING but that movie was one of the best films in it's genre of all time!! Again, what was Mama? A ghost, a creature from another dimension, a elemental spirit??? We just never know, nor do we find out WHY after jumping off a cliff with her 'baby' she morphs into an unworldly creature. Even some H.P. Lovecraft mumbo-jumbo would been better than no explanation at all. and the cricket chirping sounds...It seems that after Mimic, every creature sounds like a cockroach or cricket...Finally the ending.....SPOILERSWhy is Guillermo del Toro fascinated by killing children in the end of his films? For the shock value? Of course the ends of both Pan's Labyrinth and this film are a bit vague, but at least as mortal beings both girls died...so what if it was a 'compromise...Mama takes lily because she still clings to 'Mama' and the ethereal world, while Victoria being older, is released to the care of the living in our world...OK children dying in the end is at least not a cop-out, but it doesn't raise the caliber of this film enough to say...yeah..go see it!",4,4,12,19 January 2013
