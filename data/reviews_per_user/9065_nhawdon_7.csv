Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Travesty In All Regards, and one of the Worst Movies of All Time
","As a Star Wars fan myself, I do feel as if bias could have clouded my judgment of this movie. For that reason, I will split my review into a review of the movie and its role in the Star Wars saga, and a review of the overall quality of the movie as a whole.From the perspective of a fan, this movie is terrible. What the hell is going on? Taxes and trade disputes have no place in a Star Wars movie. Neither do racist aliens and this midichlorian crap. Way to take the fun out of using the force, Lucas. Now, it's about how many damn midichlorians you have in your blood stream, not about your ability to harness the force. I never wanted to see Darth Vader as a whiny little kid, nor did I want the terribly-rendered caricature of Jar Jar Binks ruining this movie. Lucas couldn't even recognize when he had a good thing. He killed probably the best character in the movie, Darth Maul, when he could have played an even bigger part in the later movies. This is by far the worst edition to the Star Wars universe.From the perspective of a normal reviewer, this movie is even worse. The yes-men at Fox obviously let George Lucas do whatever the hell he wanted with this one. Not even Liam Neeson could redeem possibly the worst writing in modern film. This creepy pedophile romance between Padme and Anakin was uncalled for, and I know it doesn't get any better later, not to mention the horrendous CGI. The environments looked more like matte paintings than real landscapes. And I know it's not because of the limited technology either, because movies like Blade Runner, Aliens, and 2001 were made years prior, and are much more believable than this garbage heap.This isn't only a bad film, it's an anger-inducing film. It is a disgrace to Star Wars, and it's a disgrace to every movie ever made.",5,2,13,29 December 2015
Pacific Rim," Great action, and not much else
","I came out the theater getting nothing more than I expected, which sort of annoys me. I like to be wowed, of shocked. This movie just happened. The acting in this movie was not very good, or convincing. I didn't feel very attached to the characters, and was only rooting for them because it was either them or the bad guys, who were a rowdy group of amphibious aliens who conquered planets and massacred the inhabitants for no apparent reason. Seriously, what do they get from this? Why do they do what they do? I find that this happens in many movies these days. The bad guys are only bad because they need to be bad for the plot to work. The writing was amateur, and often clich√©. The ending was boring and unoriginal, and not very satisfying. All of those aspects bought the movie down.That being said, the movie wasn't all bad. There were a few redeeming factors that contributed to my grade. One of them was the action and CGI. The Kaiju and Jaegers are very realistic, and when they clash, you're in for a wild ride. I am a self-professed action fan, and this movie delivered all of the action it promised. I absolutely loved the fight scenes, partly because they were shot in jaw-dropping 3D. They were also loud, explosive, and intense, and to top it all off, they were backed by an amazing soundtrack that gave me chills.To sum it up, a normal summer movie, with amazing action.",8,0,5,17 July 2013
The Usual Suspects," One of the Greatest Movies Ever, Period.
","After reflecting on this movie for months and months, it has slowly become one of my favorites. I read a load of negative reviews of this movie and the biggest grievances of dissenters is that the entire movie is a lie, and that watching it is pointless, because none of it ever happened. I would have to disagree.To prove my point I'll use a film somewhat similar in structure, Life of Pi. At the very end of the movie, it is revealed that Pi's entire story was a lie, and was simply a way to draw parallels between it and a much more boring story which actually happened. THIS movie lies to the viewer flat out, not the Usual Suspects. In the Usual Suspects, the names of people and places were mad up by Kint, but there is a man named Keyser Soze who was involved in the story in some way, and whatever way the story is told, 27 people were killed in an explosion, so at least some of Kint's story is true.This ambiguity is what makes the Usual Suspects so brilliant. When the movie reaches its climax, and all is revealed, it is hard not to feel an adrenaline rush, as well as a heap of mixed feelings. The main villain of the film gets away, which in and of itself is a bad thing, but I still couldn't help but crack a small knowing smile as both I and Kujan solved the case together.But alas, it was all too late. The devil really did convince us that he didn't exist.",10,1,3,28 December 2015
The Dark Knight," Good God, this movie is amazing!
","This is by far the greatest movie I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan reached new heights, and created a masterpiece. Let me start with the acting. Heath Ledger is one of the most underrated actors ever. He fit the role of the Joker much better than his previous actor, Jack Nicholson. Every word he said was more insane than the word before it. His list of famous quotes stretches more than 100 yards long. He is scary, mischievous, and downright psychotic. His crazy schemes almost always come together, and they they push their victims to the limits. Christian Bale also performed extremely well, but not as well as Ledger. He was a great Bruce Wayne, and his part was terrifically written. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman also performed extremely well, and their characters helped make the movie what it is: amazing. The suspense in this movie pushes you to the edge of your patience, and when it finally pays off, oh boy is it good! I can barely find anything wrong with this movie. It is nearly flawless.",10,1,2,27 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Graceful Sequel to the Greatest Story Ever Told
","Like many people, Star Wars was a immense part of my childhood. I watched with wonder the masterpieces of the Original Trilogy, and waited in anticipation for the Phantom Menace, a movie with expectations so high, an entire fandom would cry out in anguish if it were to let them down. And boy did it ever.After the clusterf*ck of the prequels, I have to admit that I was afraid when The Force Awakens was announced. When the trailers came out, I could hardly contain my excitement. When I found out JJ Abrams was directing it, my stomach dropped. After the disaster of the Star Trek reboot, (two of the worst movies I have ever seen) I was terrified at what he would do to this one.All of my nerves were dispelled the moment that theme blared through the speakers, and the yellow outline of 'STAR WARS' appeared on screen. As the opening music swelled, I felt a rush of adrenaline that I have rarely ever felt. As the opening crawl moved slowly across the screen, I suddenly remembered seeing the original Star Wars, and watching that crawl with childlike wonder. I felt that wonder again.The movie itself was a sensory experience the likes of which I hadn't seen since Avatar. The entire movie was one thrill after another, with a round ton of nostalgia and fan service thrown in for good measure. While it did borrow a lot from the original trilogy, it maintained its own air of originality. The prequels were supposed to be Star Wars, but they didn't feel like Star Wars. There was something missing, but I couldn't define it. I still can't, but whatever it was, this movie had it. I couldn't believe my eyes.In summation, Star Wars: The Force Awakens restored Star Wars to what is was so many years ago.",10,6,29,28 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best of the LOTR Trilogy, an Instant Classic
","This movie was simply fantastic. Action packed, suspenseful, and yet still enchanting. Acting in the movie is terrific, especially from McKellen and Mortenson. Peter Jackson reached new heights with this masterpiece, completely deserving the best picture Oscar.The plot follows the continuing adventures of the disbanded Fellowship of the Ring, in their quest to destroy the powerful One Ring. Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, and their guide Gollum are on a quest to the Cracks of Doom, while the rest of the Fellowship is preparing for war with Sauron (forger of the One Ring) and his soldiers.It this complex plot that is part of the reason that this film is so good. The CGI is breathtaking, especially for 2003. Everything in the movie looks lifelike. The cinematography, in the movie is astonishing and sweeps one off of one's feet. Battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed, intense and high-octane.I know I don't seem too exited about this movie, but this movie is terrific. If you haven't seen this movie, see it. It is a classic, and one of the best films out there.",10,2,3,18 July 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An Awe-Inspiring Feat of Filmmaking Never to be Rivaled Again
","There are many films I saw as a child that, upon an unbiased reviewing, I found objectively bad. This was not one of those movies. Of all of the films released since the beginning of the medium, this one will go down in history as a masterpiece in all respects. Acting, cinematography, writing, special effects, everything about Star Wars hits the mark. You can ignore the feats of the movie itself, and still respect its cultural impact on the world. Its legacy is impossible to ignore. Its part in the greatest story ever told is essential.There is something about Star Wars that makes it a film classic. It may be its transcendence of genre, it may be its revolutionary special effects, or it may be the movie as a whole. I have nothing but good things to say about it.",10,2,3,29 December 2015
