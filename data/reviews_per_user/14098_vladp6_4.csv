Sucker Punch," Worth watching
","Well, the movie is completely underrated here. That's why I'm leaving this brief review. It's Zack Snyder's film, not for everyone. The movie is dark, music is good, plot is excellent, three CGIs set-ups are from games - fantasy, WWI and scifi. It's a kind of mix of everything. But the major plot is brilliant, and the ending is great. You don't need to concentrate on CGI scenes or their quality. Zack Snyder could equally insert anime or just pictures instead with the same effect, it doesn't really matter. The movies is not about manga girls acting in games. When you watch all this darkness of the clinics recreated by Zack Snyder, and the final medical verdict made, and you know a bit history of American psychiatry, you start thinking more about dark American past and where all these evil people came from. Surely, not from dreams of the poor girl.",10,4,8,17 April 2015
The Book Thief," Vanila movie about Nazism
","This movie is strongly overrated, that's why I give it only one star, although I'd give it 5 stars under different circumstances for excellent acting and topic.During watching this movie, I felt very disturbed by stupid dialogues, unbelievable scenes, completely vanilla mood of the movie, everyone and surroundings are clean like from the glamour war postcards. Good Nazi propaganda movie about hard but tolerable life of a small Nazi district in Stuttgart during the war. Bad British Avros who bombed the city and killed very peaceful civilians. I felt even sorrow when the truck full of Nazi soldiers including the character of Geoffrey Rush was exploded. What is that? Another Hollywood vision of the life of Germans during the war? Why is it so glamour? Why is it so untrue and unfair to Jewish people? Honestly, I didn't feel much about the girl robbing the house of the burgmeister and her insinuations on the theme of the Nazism. It was not convincible. I didn't understand what was the sense of inclusion of the Death narrations either. It's trivial for everyone that war is bad and people die. It gave me strong impression like of watching a movie for kids, and not for adults. Those narrations and the final image of Death walking along the streets completely disconnect from the content and from the whole movie.All in all, this movie is a classical example of a glamour and banal Hollywood production; the example of how the movies should not be made.I'd recommend watching Life is Beautiful and Pianist instead, and of course Schindler's List. The Book Thief is just a poor attempt to contribute something to the genre.",1,15,35,5 April 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The complete nonsense
","I was watching this movie in IMAX 3D, and the only star I can give for CGI effects. But these days, CGI effects have become a routine and basic element of any action movie. Hollywood simply forgot how to make movies in a natural environment. It's so easy now - just put a group of 3D artists in a room, and they will do any movie for you in a short period of time with almost no expenses. There is even no need for good acting, the CGI effects will completely suppress good scenario, good acting, everything that once had values in cinematography. The tendency of Hollywood production is very clear - brainless, saturated with impressive CGI effects films, just to brainwash the audience. The modern audience like it because the majority of the modern generation does't want to think, to focus, to feel something, just relax with the bucket of popcorn and keg of coke. Watching such movies like Amazing Spider-Man 2 allows easily to browse and chat in the Facebook during the show. That's what the Hollywood ideologists want to do with the modern and future generation. This is how they see their own nation. And now we see the rating for this terrible movie - 7.5! I think Coppola and Spielberg rest already. Seriously, if you don't want to loose the great American nation in the nearest future, you should do something with this extremely low-quality flood; even censorship in this case, as a last resort, may work well.",1,7,36,13 May 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Total eclipse of the brain
","When I see rating of 8.0 for this film, it seems to me that something is wrong with people today. 80% of 150,000 really liked this movie! I'm shocked, I'm confused, I have no words to describe my negative emotions about the level of the modern audience. This movie is boring, dumb and even dumber, jokes are stupid. It's kind of parody, but it fails to be a parody like 'naked gun'. Again, because the jokes are old and not funny. I even fail to see who is the target audience for this movie, because some jokes should be rated. If the target audience is an American brainless kid of 12, I can understand, but then I question the age of the reviewers here. To sum up, if you don't want to be disappointed, just give a miss to this terrible piece of movie making. This is my sincere advice. Shame on all good actors to participate in this bacchanalia, which I cannot call 'movie'.",1,20,42,20 May 2015
