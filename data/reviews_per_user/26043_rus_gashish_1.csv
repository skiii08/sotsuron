E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Check it out!!!
","I like a lot of things in this movie, but it's some stupid moments. For example: All FBI agents wore a space costumes and walked, but, actually, it's impossible. All you can do in this space costume is jump. The most exciting scene was Elliot and E.T. flew on the bicycle, and when E.T. tried to call home. I want to recommend to mother be not so stupid. I think this movie must to see FBI and government because E.T. can come to the Earth in real, if it happens they shouldn't be so stupid. They must be more polite and try to talk with alien, not use him only for medicine experiments.I don't care about this lines. I just wanna sent my comments to this website.",10,0,1,6 November 2009
