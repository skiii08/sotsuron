The Hangover," Not just a great comedy, but a Great Movie.
","The Hangover centers around four friends and their attempt to understand the events of the previous night. Doug is getting married and he and two of his friends Stu, who is henpecked, and Phil, who doesn't appreciate what he has, are going to celebrate his bachelor party in Las Vegas. Alan, Doug's annoying soon to be step brother, wants to tag along and Doug says it's okay much to the chagrin of Stu and Phil. The four toast on the roof of their hotel and the next thing they know they are waking up without any idea of what happened the night before and they can't find Doug. Stu, Alan, and Phil must figure out what happened and find Doug before his wedding later that day.The plot of The Hangover is much more original and complex than most comedies. The fact that they have to figure out what happened with what they find makes for an interesting almost backward telling of the story. They and the audience are given the end result and both have to figure out what led up to it. It's also fun because you get to find out what everything means as the characters do. Another really amazing aspect of The Hangover was the amount of jokes they would cram into each scene. Whether they were funny or not every scene would just have joke after joke.All the characters are funny and interesting in their own way. Zach Galifianakis' performance as Alan is one of the best break out comedy performances I have ever seen. Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper also do great in both of their first big roles. Even the minor characters that only get a few lines manage to squeeze some comedy out of their very small roles, which is another thing that sets this apart from other comedies.I was somewhat disappointed in the ending however. I found it to be a bit predictable and a tad too perfect. Rarely will a comedy have a good ending though, so that isn't a big deal.So in short, The Hangover is not only one of the best movies of 2009, but one of the best comedies ever.",10,2,5,2 September 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Probably The Best Action/Adventure Movie Ever Made.
","Indiana Jones is a college professor who the government hires to find priceless relics. After hearing that Hitler and the S.S. are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, the government hires Jones to beat the Nazis to it.Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most exciting and action packed movies ever made, along with being the best Steven Spielberg has ever done. George Lucas' imagination combines with Spielberg's direction to create a film that is truly epic and amazingly gutsy. The fact that anyone would even try to cram this many action set pieces into one movie is almost as amazing as how well they executed it. Every action scene is more complex and exciting than the one before it. Raiders is like a movie made by the child inside Spielberg; unbridled creativity and enthusiasm brought to life on screen. He combines elements of almost every genre as well as many of the movies he probably loved growing up (North by Northwest, The Maltese Falcon) into a truly glorious concoction.Yes, you have to throw logic out the window in certain scenes and the acting/writing could be better, but it doesn't matter. Raiders has basically every movie beat on the amount of sheer fun you have watching it as well as one of the greatest endings ever. Raiders of the Lost Ark is not only Steven Spielberg's crowning achievement, but one of the best movies ever made and essential viewing for any film buff.",10,2,4,15 July 2010
Star Trek," Without Leonard Nimoy, this would be really good.
","Star Trek chronicles the lives of James T. Kirk and an alien named Spock. There lives intersect when they are both going to pilot school at the same time. Both end up on the USS Enterprise and must try to captain the ship after the main pilot dies.Most of the characters in Star Trek are interesting and well acted, particularly Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. Both young actors give career making performances and have good on screen chemistry as Kirk and Spock. Also, the rest of the crew including 'Bones' and Sulu are very well cast and everyone in the movie seems to fit right into their roles.The action is very exciting and the plot is good up until the biggest quality drop off in a movie I think I have ever seen. Kirk is sent to an ice planet that the older time traveling Spock happens to be living in a cave on. I'm serious, that actually happens.This older Spock proceeds to interact with the events of this time and tell characters things that will make them fulfill their destiny as he knows it. At one point old Spock goes up to young Spock and tells him 'hey, you should be good friends with Kirk your friendship will really pay off.' Aside from his mind exploding from talking to a older version of himself, why would young Spock listen to him. You can't just tell someone to be friends with someone else, that has to happen naturally. Old Spock then says he is going to go to their home planet and help them rebuild; so apparently their are going to be two versions of Spock in the same time line, how ridiculous is that.Also, Scotty doesn't figure out the formula for beaming people up, old Spock gives him the formula. That isn't cool, it's cool that Scotty thought it up, not that someone from the future told it to him. Scotty's kooky hairy friend doesn't help matters either.The idea to include Leonard Nimoy really subtracts from the quality of the movie. I was completely loving Star Trek up to this movie sinking, poorly conceived, terribly transparent plot point. It's extremely obvious that the only reason this was put in is so J.J. Abrams can service the fans of the original series. He thought it would be cool to include Leonard Nimoy and have him reference events from the show. Unfortunately, events are meaningless if the only reason they happened is because a person from the future made them happen.In my opinion this truly awful idea turns what could have been a classic sci-fi picture into just a pretty good one. Don't believe the hype, this is barely even in the Top 10 of 2009. Hopefully Nimoy won't be in the second one and it will be what this should have been.",8,0,3,4 June 2010
Public Enemies," What A Mess!
","Take two great actors(Bale and Depp), a great story(John Dillinger's life), a good director(Mann) and a Oscar-winning actress(Cotillard) and what do you get...A Complete Mess.Public Enemies centers around the life story of John Dillinger; including his rise to prominence, his love affair with Frechette, his death and his pursuit by Melvin Purvis.Very and I mean VERY little works in this movie.Jonny Depp and Christian Bale give two of worst performances in their careers. Bale has been dull in other roles but this is ridiculous, and usually you can expect Depp to add something to a role and give it a life all it's own, there is none of that here. He sleepwalks through the film like he can't wait for it to be over, a sentiment I shared.The love story between Depp and Cotillard is completely forced and there is hardly any explanation for why they love each other. They just meet go eat at a restaurant and then they're together.All the bank robbery scenes were out of nowhere and just seemed to be in there because they felt like there had to be some in the movie. As if Michael Mann just said 'alright throw in a bank robbery here.'Possibly worst of all to me was the portrayal of the police department. I'm always annoyed when Hollywood acts as if the police are the bad guys and criminals are just trying to make an honest living. The police came off as being incompetent and mean, while dillinger was this untouchable mega-criminal. In one scene Dillinger strolled right through the department that was looking for him in a room filled with his pictures and asked the cops, who were all inexplicably sitting by a radio listening to a game, what the score was. Seriously.I found myself bored and confused through the majority of Public Enemies and I would by no means suggest going to see it. If you have to, at least wait till it's out on video so you won't waste quite so much money.",5,2,6,20 August 2009
Brokeback Mountain," A Remarkable Film.
","Two cowboys named Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are hired to protect a herd of sheep as they move across the prairie. During the job they become closer and closer friends until their relationship turns intimate. Even though they both care about each other, neither feels completely comfortable living a gay lifestyle and must attempt to sort through feelings they don't fully understand.Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful film not only in the flawless cinematography of the sweeping landscapes but in the many deep and heartfelt emotions that are being dealt with. This is without a doubt one of the best romantic movies ever made, it just happens to be about two men instead of a man and a woman.The truly amazing thing is that it has a much more universal appeal to audiences than many conventional romances. Brokeback Mountain deals with relationships with friends, lovers, family as well as the idea of living of lie. Many people, gay and straight, feel as if they aren't really living the life they want and this movie captures the detrimental effect that can have. It also deals with feeling that you can't connect with anyone and you are alone in the world.All this aside, the best aspect of Brokeback Mountain would have to be the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent, but Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis Del Mar is just on another level. He embodies the role like very few actors can; every line, every look he delivers just exudes pain.Brokeback Mountain isn't just a romance and certainly isn't just a 'gay cowboy' movie. Brokeback Mountain is a movie that transverses the entire emotional spectrum and studies the human condition. It is not only one of the best dramas ever made, but possibly the most emotionally affecting movie I have ever seen. Brokeback Mountain is absolutely Unmissable and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of film.",10,6,6,12 July 2010
Terminator Salvation," Someone stop Sam Worthington before he opens the gateway to hell!
","The few humans who survived judgment day are waging a war against the machines that were responsible for the deaths of almost everyone on earth. John Connor, one of the leaders of the resistance is struggling to be the commander he knows he is destined to be and Marcus Wright, a machine who thinks he's a man, must struggle with where his allegiances truly lie.Terminator Salvation has very little to offer. The acting, writing, and characters are extremely sparse. Almost every character is about as two dimensional as a piece of cardboard and Sam Worthington acts about as good as one. This makes three action epics that he has starred in that have been a complete waste of time (Clash of the Titans, Avatar{sorry, it sucks}). For some reason instead of focusing on John Connor, who should be the main character of the movie, the filmmakers decided to focus on a ridiculous terminator who thinks he's human storyline.During most of the action scenes you can't tell what is going on, and when you can they don't make no sense. The entire climax of Terminator Salvation is one of more unrealistic and plot hole filled sections of any move in recent memory.Hollywood needs to stop making Termiator movies; it is completely ridiculous and the story ended with Terminator 2. The third movie was just a carbon copy of 2 with a female robot, this one is a complete mess and five will be even worse. So Please, no more movies about Terminators and no more movies with Sam Worthington. Thank You.",4,2,3,4 June 2010
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Shakespearian Monster Mash
","Prince Nuada is the last of a dying race and he has grown tired of watching his kind wither and die in a world that humans continue to tear apart. In order to gain back control and eliminate humans once and for all he will attempt to revive the ancient Golden Army, even if that means breaking the truce between humans and his father. As Hellboy attempts to prevent him from what would surely be the end of humanity as we know it he comes to the realization that he has much more in common with Prince Nuada than the humans he protects.Hellboy 2 is a truly amazing piece of cinema. Guillermo Del Toro manages to not only make what may be the best comic book movie ever, but also make a fantasy story for the ages. On a visual and set design level, Hellboy 2 is absolutely stunning. The world he creates in Hellboy and the creatures that populate it are complete creative bliss.The Troll Market scene is one of the happier moments I have ever had in sitting in a theater seat and it is packed to the brim with creatures that only Del Toro could think of, all the while not relying on CGI to get the job done. When every aspect of a movie is created using CGI it's hard to feel any connection to it (the Star Wars prequels anyone). I find prosthetics and makeup a much more impressive and effective method of bringing a character to life than CGI.Aside from the visual splendor and eye popping action scenes, Hellboy 2 has a huge heart buried under its thrills. At the core there's Hellboy, brought to life by the underrated Ron Pearlman, who struggles with his place in a world that fears him. Then there's Liz Sherman, his damaged pyrotechnic girlfriend who may be more lost and confused than Hellboy himself. Their confused and tragic nature is what makes the characters in Hellboy 2 so great. They are super heroes who are freaks that would be cast out if they weren't useful in protecting the world from others like them.Prince Nuada is one of the greatest villains in movie history; mainly because it would be easy to say that he wasn't a villain at all. His struggle to save his people is a true moral quandary that is very understandable given the circumstances. He believes that humans are the problem and he will stop them no matter what the cost. Is he right or is Hellboy, it's up to you to decide.Another amazing addition from the original Hellboy is Johann Krauss; the new BPRD agent whose gaseous form is contained within a special suit. He is hilariously voiced by Seth McFarlane and the applications of his amazing powers are truly endless.What I think brings down Hellboy 2's rating and consideration is that some of the humor is very silly and childish. Is that a big deal? You tell me. I agree that some scenes can be overly silly but that adds to the fun atmosphere and tone of the film.Hellboy 2 is an absolute classic. It's filled with thrills to put you on the edge of your seat, it packs a much greater emotional punch than almost any movie of its type, and it has a ton of laughs as well. I can't smile without it.",10,3,5,5 January 2011
Shutter Island," A Dark Brooding Masterpiece.
","Shutter Island centers around two U.S. Marshalls who must search for a missing patient on said island, which has a large complex specifically designed for harboring the most violent and disturbed mental patients. Agent Teddy Daniels and his partner must try to understand the mysteries of Shutter Island while attempting to unearth a plot that may go all the way up to the men who run it.Shutter Island is a very unique and interesting movie. The acting, directing, and the script are all excellent as can be expected in a Scorsese movie. But the quality that sets this apart from most of his previous works is the tone and genre. Scorsese does an amazing job of creating a haunting and dark tone that fits such a suspenseful movie very well.The twist is also very good, even though it was given away by the trailers. At the end of the movie it is revealed that Leonardo DiCaprio is a patient on Shutter Island and everything that has happened has been an attempt to allow him to live out his delusion of a missing patient and two U.S. Marshalls investigating a secret plot. This idea is a bit far fetched, but that is easily forgivable when you consider how well it was interwoven into the plot.Upon watching it a second time I noticed all the subtle hints that were placed throughout the movie. That is another quality of Shutter Island that I admire; it's re-watchability. After you know what Leonardo DiCaprio is, it makes the second viewing an entirely different and highly enjoyable experience. You can find all the things you missed the first time and understand all the things that seemed vague and confusing when you didn't know where it was going. The only real gripe I have would be that Scorsese never really captures true emotion here. The scenes that are supposed to resonate don't really pull you in like they should, specifically the scene by the lake with his wife and kids. Not to say that you don't care about the characters just that it misses the mark somewhat in the drama department. Shutter Island is a very underrated movie and ranks with some of Scorsese's best. His trip into suspense/mystery actually works very well and he captures a tone that I've never seen before. Somewhere between horror and suspense he finds a gray area that gives Shutter Island a feeling all it's own. Certainly worth watching and re-watching again and again.",10,25,36,14 May 2010
Watchmen," Not Bad, but Please read the Graphic Novel it's much, much Better
","Watchmen centers around a variety of very human super heroes. After a death of a common friend, they all must meet up again and try and unearth a possible criminal plot.Watchmen is not a complete waste. This is a very faithful adaptation of the Stellar Grahpic Novel, but it manages to loose most of the life of the book. The characters are fairly interesting and unlike most super heroes but as a movie of the book and as a movie in general it isn't particularly great. The only thing that saves it from complete failure is the quality of the subject matter is is based on.It becomes clear very early that Zack Snyder was not the right man for this job. Virtually all he did was directly put most of the graphic novel onto the screen with no directing technique and then what he added/changed was very weird or just plain bad. If you saw 300 you understand his method of directing: Slow down violence to make it really cool and meaningful. Unfotunately all this does it make it seem very melodramatic and out of place. If the material he were adapting weren't so good he would have completely blown it (Again, 300). But, I do have to give him credit for how little he changed, and for the most part he cut out what he should have.The acting is kind of a mix bag. At times it's decent(Jackie Earle Haley) at other times it's awful (Malin Ackerman). So I wouldn't say the acting is out right bad, but it's certainly not Oscar worthy. But it's not always the actors' fault, I found some of the casting to be outright mind boggling: Matthew Goode as Ozymandis (WHAT?). I found Patrick Wilson to be a little to young and skinny to be Night Owl as well.It's hard for me to be that objective as I read the book first, but this movie just doesn't seem to get the same meaning and feeling as the graphic novel did. It doesn't appear that Snyder took appropriate time and care in making this a very cohesive movie. Many scenes seem very out of place and some are just ridiculous (Richard Nixon anyone?). The violence seemed gratuitous and unnecessary oftentimes, as did the sex scene.So, if your never going to read the graphic novel then see this just so you know the story as it is very interesting and original. But I implore you Please, Please, Please read the graphic novel.",7,2,4,6 May 2010
District 9," Highly Overrated!
","District 9 centers around the slum of the same name that a race of aliens were sent into by the U.S. government. During a relocation effort the main character is infected with alien DNA and he must join up with and alien and his son so they can get home and he can get back his humanity. Sounds interesting right, well it really isn't. Don't get me wrong the concept is extremely original and the way it is done is also not like any other sci-fi movie I have ever seen, but in the end it just doesn't work that well.To start with none of the characters were interesting or well developed. The main character was extremely weak. First of all the actor portraying him wasn't very good, and Second of all his personality would change from scene to scene. At the beginning of the movie he was portrayed a silly and somewhat comical character and then suddenly things get serious and the audience is supposed to care what happens to him. He was defined by what was happening to him instead of what type of person he was. If something funny was happening then he was a funny character, if something sad then he was a sympathetic character. The only back story we were given on the character is that his step dad wasn't very nice and he occasionally made things for his wife. Connecting with any of the alien characters was also difficult as they were completely CGI and just spoke in weird sounds. How can you truly connect with a character with no voice and no real face. The villain was absolutely absurd and out of nowhere as well as having the magical unkillable gene that so many dumb villains do. He narrowly escaped death more times than I can count and of course they had to have the cliché showdown between him and the main character at the end. The audience was given no explanation for his hate of the aliens and at one point in the movie he actually said 'I can't believe I get paid for this, I love watching you aliens die.' Now that's just bad writing. Despite the interesting concept the plot was no picnic either. Most of the action scenes had almost no setup and in essence no meaning. And with every good point there was a plot hole to cancel it out. I was also left with a number of questions, for instance: Why was Van De Merwe not sedated when they were going to operate on him? Why was it so easy for Van De Merwe to escape the military base, didn't he run out into a crowded street? Why did it take so long for them to find him when he not only had his phone on but continued to call his girlfriend? How did Van De Merwe and the alien escape once they had the tube? Where was Van De Merwe planning to go when he flew the spaceship away? How did he figure out how to fly it so quick? Why did the Nigerians want a bunch of weapons they couldn't use? How come one second the spaceship is crashed and Van De Merwe couldn't fly it then the alien jumps in and it is just fine?At many points the drama felt like drama for drama's sake. Not only do they have to cattle prod him to get him to shoot but they also make him shoot a live alien? So overall it isn't by any means one the worst movies I have ever seen, but not near one of the best either. This should not be on the Top 250, let alone at 28 or wherever it is, and I don't see what exactly sets it apart from so many other mediocre sci-fi epics we have seen over the years.",7,9,20,20 August 2009
Kick-Ass," An Occasionally Fun, Mostly Juvenile Action/Comedy
","Dave is a depressed nerd who can't understand why no one has every tried to be a super hero and decides to try it himself and call himself Kick Ass. While attempting to help out Katie Deauxma, his high school crush, he encounters two other vigilantes named Hit Girl and Big Daddy; a deranged father and daughter who are just a bit more serious about dolling out justice.Kick-Ass is not soul-shattering stuff. It mostly consists of vulgar jokes, gratuitous violence and super hero clichés. The characters aren't particularly interesting and outside of Chloe Moretz, who is actually pretty impressive as Hit Girl, the acting is sub par. The plot is a bit of a mess and it's hard to really follow or care about what is going on. Kick-Ass teeters between action and comedy and never really finds a happy medium. It's not funny enough to be a comedy and not action oriented enough to be a proper action movie.The music is good and some of the action sequences are impressive, even though suspension of disbelief is a must. I also have to commend Kick-Ass for it's originality and guts as Matthew Vaughn tried to combine many genres and include particularly shocking elements; a little girl slicing and dicing criminals with total relish. But, even though I appreciate him pushing the envelope I dislike the fact that it is used as a gimmick. It's as if Vaughn is saying; 'isn't a little girl killing people cool,' instead it just being part of the story.Despite it's few good points Kick-Ass is a failure, mainly because of what it could have been. What was hailed as an ingenious retooling of the super hero genre feels very rehashed. You've heard these lines before, you've seen these characters before and the comedy; you've not laughed at before.",9,5,12,4 August 2010
The Hurt Locker," Very Overrated, but still a decent movie.
","Sergeant William James is brought in as the new leader of a bomb squad in Iraq but his strange personality and devil-may-care attitude don't really mesh with the rest of his unit.There are many things I enjoyed about The Hurt Locker. The acting was pretty good all around, especially Jeremy Renner. It was shot very well and the sets really made you feel like you were actually in the Iraq war. The first half hour or so was very good and was truly interested as to where they were going with it. Where they went with however, that wasn't so great. Right around the overly long, poorly explained sniping scene my interest began to shrink and shrink up until the end, which I enjoyed. I also enjoyed that no real side was taken because I am so sick of war movies trying to tell the audience how they should feel about a war.I found a good majority of The Hurt Locker to be very boring, confusing and a bit unrealistic. There actually weren't that many bomb defusing scenes and I felt that those were by far the most exciting of the movie. The scene where his psychologist dies was extremely transparent as well. It was obvious they were trying to say that he was far too soft to be in the military. He spouts touchy feely psychobabble the entire movie and then he gets blown up because he is too trusting/nice. Not to mention he probably wouldn't be allowed to just wander around during a mission like that. Not cutting edge stuff. The entire section with the little kid was unnecessary and dull. He goes into town finds the family, questions them, and just waltzes back into the base; Come On. Also, I may have been confused but didn't the kid set up shop inside an American Military base because that doesn't seem right to me. I personally believe that The Hurt Locker won the Best Picture Oscar and was so highly publicized for 2 reasons. One, It was about the Iraq war and no one wants to say it is bad. I appreciate what the soldiers are doing too, but that doesn't make the movie any better. Second, It was directed by a woman, and she is James Cameron's ex-wife. The Academy finally had a woman to hand the Best Director Oscar to and we know how much they love James Cameron. So, The Hurt Locker is nothing near a classic but it's certainly worth a look.",8,0,3,3 June 2010
Clash of the Titans," Action and Nothing Else
","Clash of the Titans centers around a half god, half human named Perseus(Sam Worthington). Zeus is mad that humans don't fear/respect him anymore and decides to let his brother Hades wreak havoc on the earth so humans will again bend to his will. The only thing stopping Hades from destroying the human race is a small force of Greeks led by Perseus. They must find a way to defeat The Kraken, a deadly creature that Zeus has threatened to release, and save the world as they know it.Sound Good........Well, It Isn't.NO cliché is left unturned as Perseus and his band of one dimensional friends must make their way through a trek that feels like so much well worn territory. I especially enjoyed the obligatory romance and the two 'cooky' characters that lightened the mood with their 'hilarious' one liners. Once again, Sam Worthington brings his cardboard 'hey, I'm an everyman who must magically become the greatest warrior ever in five minutes' shtick. I'm not sure why he has been getting so much work but if you've seen him in any other movie you've seen him in Clash of the Titans. Aside from him pretty much every character follows suit, acting as if they are robots programmed to say their lines and nothing else. Liam Neeson, the only halfway legitimate actor in this movie is only in about two scenes and is wearing the most ridiculous Zeus costume I've ever seen.Not to say that it's all the actor's fault. Their acting can't fix a script that seems to be nothing more than stage directions leading the actors to the next big action scene, which their are plenty of. Not to say that their good, in fact they are actually very bland and uninteresting. It's amazing to me with all the effects and money put into this movie that the filmmaker's couldn't even make breathtaking action scenes, especially when you consider how little time must have been spent on the other parts of the movie.So, Clash of the Titans manages nothing but lots of action scenes and the action scenes aren't even that good.",5,1,2,2 May 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Truly One of a Kind.
","2001: A Space Odyssey is a very difficult film to summarize, but I will give it a shot. A mysterious monolith that dates back to the dawn of time is found on the moon and scientists are attempting to excavate and study its mysterious nature. Also, two astronauts headed to Jupiter must deal with Hal 9000, the artificial intelligence controlling their ship, which appears to be malfunctioning.2001 is not only one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time but easily one of the most strange and original pieces of film art to ever grace the screen. Every facet of 2001: A Space Odyssey is so meticulously detailed and painstakingly filmed that it's truly a wonder to behold. And while its detail and realism are some of its highest commendations they are also 2001's biggest flaws. Stanley Kubrick crafts a sci-fi universe that is so realistic and believable that it is boring.I believe that by making certain scenes go on for what can seem like an eternity he was attempting to make the entire concept of 2001 being a science fiction movie blaze' and unimportant. As if to say; 'yeah it's science fiction so what, I've got an important story to tell.' And what a story it is.2001: A Space Odyssey deals with everything from god to artificial humanity with such subtly that it's very hard to even discern what any of it means during initial viewings. Everyone who watches this movie once and hates it should at least give it one more chance. Like most really great films the more you watch it the better it gets. Though many scenes can be tedious to watch more than once, 2001 has such a vast amount of subtext it is virtually a completely different film every time you watch it.2001: A Space Odyssey is easily the most misunderstood and hard to love of all cinematic classics. It's easy to write it off as a self-indulgent piece of pseudo sci-fi nonsense, but it is truly so much more than that. It's not only the most realistic portrait of what our future may really look like but a meditation on where humanity has been and where it may be going. It's a spectacle unlike any other and a film that should not be missed.",10,1,6,1 January 2011
Alice in Wonderland," If it doesn't gel, then it's not aspic... and this just isn't gelling.
","Alice in Wonderland centers around teenage Alice who again travels to the magical wonderland she visited as a child. She has forgotten about it though and must learn about all the interesting creatures and cultures as she tries to save Wonderland from the grip of the evil Red Queen.It's hard to say what exactly, but something definitely went very wrong during the production of Alice in Wonderland. They had a great cast as well as a great director who seemed perfectly suited for a visionary movie like this, but amazingly none of this ever really comes together right. Aside from some of the visuals and a few of the characters none of this really works much at all.Aside from the poorly written script possibly the biggest problem would be the pacing. Characters and plot points are introduced at a such a break neck pace that it is very hard for any of it to really register in your mind. Every five minutes a new creature is introduced and then seems to just fade into the background as more characters are brought in. The viewer never really gets a chance to get to know or reflect on any of these characters and it's hard to find their motivation. Even Alice, who is the only two dimensional character in the film isn't even much of a character. Why does she care at all about the fate of Wonderland, I'm not sure.The acting isn't particularly state of the art either. I didn't find Depp's Mad Hatter to be funny or interesting, just annoying. Depp is a very good actor and excels in creating interesting character traits and turning what would have been boring characters into the high point of an otherwise dull movie (Jack Sparrow). He doesn't manage to get that here.The only reason I can find to see Alice in Wonderland would be for the visuals or if you are a huge fan of the original and just want to see Burton's take on the story. I'm not a fan of 3D, but if you are don't see it for that either. The 3D is not nearly as well integrated as in Avatar.",6,3,6,6 May 2010
Avatar," A Sometimes Fun but Mostly Mindless Action Epic.
","Jake Sully joins a military operation on the foreign planet Pandora after his twin, who was working on the project, dies. The military is attempting to move the natives off their land so they can colonize and use the land for their own purposes. Jake must use a computer program that allows him to control the body of one of these aliens so he can infiltrate their culture and coerce them to move their homes. I am AMAZED at how much critical acclaim Avatar is receiving. Aside from the visuals, which are at times stunning, this is one of the most predictable and clichéd big budget movies I have seen in a long while. Every, and I mean every little twist and turn of the plot you can see coming a MILE away.-There's one flying thing that no one has ever ridden before: I wonder if that's going to pay off at all -Jake prays to the 'tree gods' for help in the fight: I wonder if their going to help in someway, no they'll probably end the movie with the natives losing and the military slaughtering all of them -They are trying to save Sigourney Weaver by putting her soul into her Avatar: I wonder if their going to use that later to create one the cheesiest everybody wins happy endings everWorse than the obvious plot points though, would have to be the ridiculously, almost comically one dimensional characters. Let's see they got the everyman, the evil heartless military commander, the non caring rich businessman, the sassy cool female character (several), the nerdy uncool friend, and probably a few more I'm forgetting. I was also very annoyed that it perpetuated the conceited sentiments of movies like The Last Samurai and Dances With Wolves. A white American human walks into an alien culture and in five minutes he's 'Aw Shucked' his way into becoming the most important being of their species. One day he joins the culture, the next day he is giving speeches to them and receiving help from a god that hasn't answered their prayers up to this point. The movie portrays it as if without the help of lovable old Jake Sully their culture would have been wiped out.I also wasn't blown away by the 3D. Yeah, it was far superior to any 3D that has been available up to this point, but SO WHAT. It was cool to look at for the first 15 minutes or so and then I wanted a better movie to watch. Avatar isn't completely devoid of charm however. Most of the action scenes are exciting and well designed as far as that goes, and it has a fairly clever if extremely derivative story.",5,2,6,2 May 2010
Eyes Wide Shut," Why so Underrated?
","Dr. William Hartfor has just had a fight with his wife and begins to realized that his marriage may be collapsing. As he wonders New York City he has a series of strange encounters that culminates with him visiting a strange masked ball where nothing is as it seems.I went into Eyes Wide Shut without high expectations. I am a huge Kubrick fan and I knew, since he directed it, it couldn't be a complete waste of time but due to its lack of acclaim I figured it was one of his weaker efforts. I was blown away.Eyes Wide Shut is a cinematic masterpiece that, in true Kubrick fashion, can be interpreted in innumerable ways and puzzled over for hours. Eyes Wide Shut dissects everything from marriage to sexual perversion all the while containing an ominous tone that turns it into some perverse horror story. Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise both give excellent career defining performances as does Sydney Pollack even with his extremely short screen time. I'm not sure why this isn't considered one of Kubrick's best. Virtually every movie he has made, including the disappointing Full Metal Jacket, are considered to be some of the greatest pictures to every grace a multiplex, yet Eyes Wide Shut was virtually ignored by critics and audiences alike. I guess most of his movies were misunderstood at the time of their release and the intense expectation everyone had coming in didn't help either, but don't be fooled. Eyes Wide Shut is an amazing achievement and one that you can watch over and over again. I have watched it five or six times now and every time I notice a few new things and discover another way you could interpret a specific scene or phrase. Trust me; Eyes Wide Shut will blow you away.",10,4,7,28 December 2010
Crazy Heart," Very Formulaic.
","Bad Blake is a washed up country music star and he is attempting to get his life back together while juggling his faded career with a serious drinking problem.Crazy Heart is unfortunately a very boring formulaic movie that just plods along until the end finally arrives. There is very little that isn't expected and Crazy Heart follows the exact formula of about a dozen other washed up ____ movies. And if you have seen The Wrestler this is essentially a carbon copy with a lot less edge and a lot worse acting/directing.Don't get me wrong; I like Jeff Bridges and his performance isn't bad but an Oscar, come on. Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's also very capable, is completely wasted as Blake's very convenient love interest. I was never really clear on why she liked Blake that much and I was even less clear as to why we were supposed to care.Crazy Heart is not a horrible movie all things concerned, but I have it rated so low because of how little new it has to offer. I have no reason to watch it again and it never pulled me in at all. I much prefer a movie with tons of plot holes that entertains me somewhat.",5,4,9,3 June 2010
Inception," The Most Original and Entertaining Movie In a Long Time.
","Cobb, an operative trained in the art of manipulating the dreamland, is hired for a particularly difficult job involving Inception, implanting an idea into someone's mind, which many believe to be impossible.When I first saw Inception I looked at it all wrong. I was focusing on the all of it's flaws while ignoring all of it's many gifts. Yes, many of the ideas in Inception don't make strict logical sense and some of the characters we've seen before but it doesn't matter. Some movies if you just check logic at the door you are in for the ride of the your life and this is one of the those movies.The concept of infiltrating the dreamland and stealing information like some of sort of demented bank job is such a great idea with so many cinematic implications that it's a crime to just disregard it because is 'doesn't make sense.' Movies are meant to tell you an amazing story and let you escape the world for a while and Inception has that in spades. No other director is currently pushes the bounds of film like Christopher Nolan. He is a true visionary and I think many people are quick to discard him and say he is overrated. Whether you think he is overrated or not; he is consistently created original movie concepts and that's a very hard thing to do these days. Nolan also refused to shoot Inception in 3D as well; which I admire because that has quickly become Hollywood's go to big bucks gimmick.In Inception, Nolan creates not only some of the best action scenes in recent history but some of the best all time. The way Nolan is able to weave a dream within a dream within a dream into a coherent scene is truly a wonder. It's mental Olympics just to keep up with all these narrative strands at one time but it's also a blast trying to solve this mind puzzle that flies at you at 100 miles per hour.Inception isn't just strictly meaningless fun however. Inception deals deeply with memories and dreams and specifically how they can affect and warp the mind. The idea of functioning in a word where bad memories can come back to haunt you in a physical form is at once cinematic excellence and a Freudian psychological study.Inception is not only the best movie of 2010 but a cinematic adventure to rival Raiders of the Lost Ark. If Inception is a dream...I don't want to wake up.",10,0,5,28 December 2010
Toy Story 3," One of Pixar's Most Meaningful Films and It's an Absolute Blast.
","Andy is going off to college and what's left of his toys are afraid of ending up in the attic or worse; the garbage can. After a mix up with with a garbage bag Andy's toys find themselves being donated to Sunnyside Daycare. Once they discover how nice it is there they must decide whether to return to Andy, who no longer plays with them, or stay at Sunnyside which seems to be the perfect place for a toy...or is it? Toy Story 3 is filled with one beautifully constructed and visually arresting scene after another. All the characters look better than ever, backed by the consistently amazing voice work of the Toy Story series, and every scene pops with vibrant colors and and toys of all shapes and sizes. In addition to the numerous exciting action scenes, and there are plenty, the humor is another quality that elevates this from just another Pixar sequel. Yeah, some jokes are juvenile and go on too long but a majority of the comedy is amazingly mature and precisely and cleverly spoofs many cinematic cliché's.Put looking past the fun and excitement of Toy Story 3 is a cleverly written script that deals with getting old, leaving your childhood behind and becoming unimportant to the people who matter to you the most. Though I find the final scene to be a bit sappy and overly drawn out it a touching and cutting analogy for growing up. What aspects of your childhood are left behind as you begin your journey to adulthood? Some part of us all yearns for the years when our lives were simple and our exuberant joy so easy to attain.Whatever your age and cinematic preferences I believer you will find Toy Story 3 to be a thoroughly enjoyable and shockingly heartfelt adventure seen through a child's eyes. Believe the Hype.",10,0,2,29 December 2010
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Absolutely Amazing. Best movie in a long time, Animated or Otherwise.
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is about a fox who must give up the bird stealing business to get a regular daytime job. After he's settled down with another fox and started a family he becomes bored with his life and decides to go back to stealing birds for one last big job.I don't know if I have any real complaints about Fantastic Mr. Fox.The visuals are some of the best I have ever seen. Every single scene of Fantastic Mr. Fox is an absolute feast for the eyes. All the little sets are amazingly well designed and there are so many little things to notice. I watched Fantastic Mr. Fox at least 5 times and every time I'll notice one or two more things that I didn't notice before. The camera work is just a wonder to behold as well. Wes Anderson manages to get right down in the middle of these sets were most stop motion movies don't get. Also, many zooms and face shots are used for the characters which most stop motion movies steer clear of.The script is amazing as well. So many clever lines and jokes are interspersed throughout the dialog. Also, there are many clever analogies and points made about society and human/animal nature. Having animals behave like humans can't help but make the viewer think about how like animals humans really are when you come right down to it.Every character in Fantastic Mr. Fox is interesting and amazingly well voice acted. All the actors manage to breath so much life into these characters that they become real in your mind. George Clooney and Jason Schwartzman are particularly brilliant as is their father-son dynamic in the film.I truly have nothing bad to say about this movie and I believe that everyone should see it. I also believe that it far surpasses many of the overrated animated movies of the last few years (Ratatouille, Up, etc.)Sorry Hurt Locker, this is the Best Movie of 2009.",10,2,4,6 May 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Can the Academy stop giving movies like this Best Picture.
","Jamal Malik has made it onto the Indian version of Who Wants to Be A Millionaire and he has to recount his very strange and tragic life to explain how he knows so many of the answers.The structure of Slumdog Millionaire, not the plot itself, is about the only thing I can truly commend this movie for. The way it unfolds with Jamal giving us bits and pieces of his life as he makes his way through the questions on a game show is an extremely clever and original way to have a story play out. This is where my admiration for Slumdog ends.The acting isn't bad, but it isn't great either. Danny Boyle used actual Mumbai slum children for the roles so I can give the acting a pass. What I can't give a pass to is the obvious attempt to manipulate the audience using sympathy inducing tragedies.I'm not saying that children in Mumbai slums don't have it bad, I'm sure they do. What I'm saying is that watching a character bumble through tragedy after tragedy just so we will feel sorry for them is neither entertainment nor film. This is an obvious attempt to play on the audience's emotions. You put a poor slum kid through the ringer and then give him a million dollars and the girl of his dreams at the end of the movie and everyone in the theater is supposed to think: 'thank god he finally got some happiness.' Not Me.First of all, if the girl meant so much to him he shouldn't have got the million because that is a much more meaningful message: You don't need money if you have love.Second of all, after enough tragedy happens to one character it becomes meaningless and unrealistic. Every single bad thing in the world is not going to happen to one person, sorry it just doesn't make sense. For true drama to work it has to be at least somewhat rooted in reality, this isn't. They had every tragedy they could think of happen to Jamal just so the audience would feel sorry for him.That is what truly annoys me about Slumdog; the fact that because of this strategy it has received such critical acclaim and won the best picture Oscar. No one wants to criticize a movie like this or they will feel like they are being cruel to all the poor slum children in the world. It's very frustrating.",6,5,7,3 June 2010
