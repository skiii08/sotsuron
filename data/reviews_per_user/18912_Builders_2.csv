Walk the Line," An emotionally triumphant film
","One reason that Walk the Line is so good is that I can watch it multiple times without ever getting bored (four viewings so far.) In my opinion, there are no flat parts in this story, and the music is always compelling, like a good album. What is so good about Walk the Line? A: The principal actors are completely facile, their characterizations are so translucent, that it's like knowing John and June personally. B: The editing is very tight and tells the story succinctly with no superfluous scenes. C: The emotions portrayed are those of real people, and are entirely convincing. The camera focuses on the faces a lot, and that is where the story is conveyed. D: Good character is proved to be triumphant in the end, and weak character is overcome, i.e. good morals, patience, and real love are rewarded.",9,0,0,25 September 2006
For Love of the Game," Predictable, but Liked It
","I really liked Kelly Preston's role in this, it's the first time I've seen her perform. She played off Costner very naturally. She does wonderful things with her face. KC's character was less understated than usual, with a sensitive portrayal of emotion. The supporting cast was great, especially J. K. Simmons as the Tiger's manager. The flashbacks worked well as a plot device, and provided good character development.In my opinion this was a better love story than a baseball story. The 'Yankees' were boorrring (though not the stadium). They could have been written into the plot enough to make them real people. Somehow KC doesn't look like a pitcher to me, although he threw plenty of great pitches, and made some good plays. He was a little too buttoned down.For overall thematic excellence, I'll take Field of Dreams (never seen Bull Durham) but for romantic spark, I'll take FLOTG. My favorite KC flick is 'A Perfect World'. DWW was OK too.",7,0,1,14 August 2006
