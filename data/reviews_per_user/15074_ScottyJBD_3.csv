The Blair Witch Project," Both good and bad
","This movie did not really scare me at all, but i thougtht it was intense and suspenseful. It was a good movie until the end when it just ended, usually i say i would like a movie to have an ending like this where it just leaves it a mystery, but it leaves people wondering and more people hate that than like that, it was still a good movie but i want to know more!!!",7,0,1,24 September 1999
Final Destination 2," Waaaaaaaaaay better than the first
","Ive never liked a movie before, had a sequel come out, seen it, and then walked out liking the sequel 10 times better than the first, not to mention the first was very original, and thats hard to come by these days.This movie NEVER lets up, its death after death after death, and just when you thought it was time for a breather, someone dies.Some might think the movie will be too predictable, but its amazing at how unpredictable it turned out to be. First you think someones done for, they survive, only to die an instant later, completely off guard.This is the most entertaining and intense movie ive seen in a very long time, and with the success of this, Final Destination 3 should be pretty solid, but i dont know, this movie was so good, that it doesnt leave a lot of hope for the 3rd, no chance itll even come close to surpassing this.Best sequel ive seen in years, 10/10",10,2,2,31 January 2003
Resident Evil," Wow
","Im a big Resident Evil fan and when i first heard about the plot, i had low expectations, but as time when on, i was sure it would be a great movieI went into the theatre with great expectations and i wasnt disappointed at all, it doesnt follow the game at all, but in a way it does, and it does it very well.I am very proud of what Anderson has done and i hope this is his big break into making more movies.",7,0,0,16 March 2002
