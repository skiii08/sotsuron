The Ring," stop the comparisons
","I believe this film stands on its own as a well made thriller. Unfortunately, people immediately feel the need to find every scene in the movie that was remotely similar to another film. Good directors borrow, great directors steal, right? Right. Anyway, aside from a few overdone scenes and contrived scares, the Ring is a competent remake of the original. The main problem lies in why a remake was made in the first place. For money, I know. This is a shame. Read: There were no holes in the plot. Anyway who disagrees, please email me and I will explain. Just because you didn't get it doesn't make it a bad movie.The American additions to the screenplay tend to hand hold a bit too much but American audiences are stupid, right? I jest. This film is well ahead of the majority of horror/thrillers hitting the screens lately.I hope it does quite well. The genre needs a boost. It is worth your money and time.",9,1,2,10 October 2002
