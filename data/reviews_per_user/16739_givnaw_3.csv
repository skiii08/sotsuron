The Blair Witch Project," Yeah, It's a Trick, but SO WHAT?
","I am convinced that there is a direct correlation between a person's intelligence (or sophistication) and how much they liked this movie. If you thought it was crap, you are dumb; if you thought it was fun and scary, you are smart. This will sound egotistical, but, of course, I really enjoyed it. The biggest complaint coming from the haters of the movie is that it looked cheap and was shot through a video cam. HELLO! Where does it say that every movie ever released needs to be on film, with gorgeous, razor-sharp photography, a rich, professional-sounding musical track, acted by big-name movie stars, in other words, like most of the movies you pay to see at a theatre. I love the fact that so many viewers were waiting for the big wide screen image to come up, AND IT NEVER DID! The creators of the movie had a fabulous idea and they pulled it off completely. Yes, the movie is a kind of trick, or stunt. But aren't all movies, to some degree? Don't we all have to suspend our sense of credibility a bit when we see, for example, Star Wars, or Halloween, or The Green Mile, or ET? These movies do have the look of big-time Hollywood, with the photography and the special effects and the costumes and actors and music. The creators of Blair Witch DELIBERATELY AVOIDED all of that, because it would have been a distraction, and would have gone against everything they were trying to do. If anyone WAS NOT frightened by the last few minutes of Blair Witch, it was because they were having a childish tantrum, thinking (correctly) that this movie wasn't like other movies, and that fact made them uncomfortable and therefore, frustrated. As if to say, 'this movie is bad'.....'I could make a better movie blindfolded'.......'I'm p***ed that I spent my money and time on this crap', etc.. I have watched movies for 50+ years, and the last five minutes of this movie were right up there with any of the scariest things I've ever seen. I take my hat off to the makers of this film. I loved it for what it was: a very different and fun concept, which was cheap to make but made millions. Definitely not intended to be a 'cinema classic'.",Null,0,1,24 July 2002
Mission: Impossible II," You mean Improbable, Implausible or Imbecilic
",The mask gimmick wouldn't work even ONCE let alone three or four times. What a joke! This was a cartoon. Avoid it at all costs. Perfectly epitomizes for Cruise the concept of 'selling out'. And exemplifies the mindlessness of today's audiences. Will appeal greatly to boys ages 10-13.,Null,0,1,6 September 2002
This Is Spinal Tap," Luvved It!
","Musings: To think that now, after 20-odd years, there are STILL hair bands out there seriously toiling, with their skin-tight leather pants and padded crotches, make-up and jewelry! I wonder how many of these pretty little girly men have affected an English accent? And if they are not really popular, where their music and performing makes them enough money to live on, to buy some insularity, where do they go when they are not on stage or rehearsing indoors 'with the lads'? I would not want to go out to the grocery store or hardware store or any other place looking like that. Surely, in those getups, you'd be inviting an ass-kicking, would you not?
That's what always amazed me about the Rolling Stones: Jagger played the part of the tough 'Street-Fighting Man', but at the same time the little twerp, who weighed, what, about 140, would prance around in his capes and makeup like a bleeding fairy. But I liked the Stones for years anyway (but not now because they are too old and make too much money for playing music that they played 30+ years ago; it's a disgrace and they should be ashamed). Unlke most of us, and like the Stones, Spinal Tap didn't have to face any of this aggro because they, at least at one time, could fill stadiums! And in this movie they are running on the fumes of their previous success.
Sorry about the digression. EVERYTHING about this movie is perfect. I was raised on rock (Stones, Beatles, Jeff Beck, The Who, Rod Stewart, Ten Years After, Blodwyn Pig, King Crimson, etc.) and this music and its practitioners had been screaming out for parody. Thank God that mssrs. Guest, McKean, Reiner, et.al. have done it up right. The endless series of exploding drummers, the choking on SOMEONE ELSE'S vomit, the fatal gardening accidents, the hissy fit over the dressing room refreshments, Fred Willard, the one-foot actual size reproduction of Stonehenge, Derek being trapped in the plastic pod, Paul Shaffer's character begging them to kick his ass, the manager, the girl friend, the songs, the lyrics, the accents.
Christopher Guest is an absolute genius and a fantastic actor. This is a TRUE classic and so are the other ones such as Waiting For Guffman and Best in Show. Now, does anyone know where I can find a copy of 'Break Like the Wind'?",8,0,2,8 October 2002
