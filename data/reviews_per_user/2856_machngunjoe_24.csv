First Man," If you are interested in the subject it's worth a watch
",I saw the comments that this movie was boring and such. It's a bio pic. So there won't be loud explosions and super slow-mo. If you are an open mouth breather that enjoys Michael Bay movies this movie is not for you.In short the movie depicts the life of Neil Armstrong. There was plenty of drama as astronauts did lose their lives in order to get to the moon. The movie puts an emphasis on the relationship between Armstrong and his wife and family.I think for a bio-pic the movie had plenty to watch and be excited about. There was a sequence before the moon launching the was really good and had me at the edge of my seat.It's not the greatest movie you will see but it was really good and right up there with Tom Hanks Apollo 13.Enjoy. Ignore the haters.,7,0,0,26 July 2019
Black Swan," All involved excelled, one of the greatest thrillers ever.
","Darren Aronofsky is so good at filming anxiety, most of his movies leave me feeling that way and personally, since I usually feel like I got robbed at the Movie theater, I feel like I got more then my money's worth if a 'movie' can make me feel anything other then a violation.This movie is one of the best around in its genre, it may be a little uncomfortable for those who may have found Basic Instinct to be too much, there is little or no nudity but this movie has sexuality intertwined, I don't want to give anything away so I'll leave it at that.This movie was wonderfully stylized and made the difficult topic of ballerinas amazingly interesting with what they go through, the physical torture they receive on their bodies, etc.If you like Darren Aronofsky's films then you should without a doubt see this, among all of his films I would have to say this may be his best although personally 'The Fountain' is my favorite movie of all time. See this movie.",8,4,10,20 December 2010
Star Trek," Good Popcorn Movie, Bad for Trekies
","The trailer said it all. 'This ain't your parents Star Trek' First the Good: The Special Effects were very good, lots of action, a few teary moments along with some laughs. Karl Urban was by far the most convincing rendition of the original characters, Scotty and Sulu were also very good adaptations and to those three actors they have my thanks.What was also very good in my opinion, was the first 3 minutes of the movie including the intro music into the Movie Title. All of that captures me every time I watch it. Unfortunately I turn the movie off after that. Now the Bad: There were many things that were not consistent with the original story, such as certain physical impossibilities in the original story that are now possible in the new installment. Also certain relationships that didn't exist before that now exist and feel a little bit abnormal. For example, love interests that would not make sense before, all of a sudden are shoved in our faces as if it is plausible. J.J. Abrams fixed all of these by implementing in the plot an alternate Universe, so this movie didn't have to follow anything the original series or the movie told us, which in my opinion ruins it all. It makes all the episodes and movies including all the variations are now somehow obsolete according to the new plot line.I felt like that was extremely cheap, like someone had a good idea that wasn't supported by the already existing mythology of Star Trek, so they created this ridiculous parallel universe thing to make it happen.There are many goofs in this film, too many to go over but the one that was sooooo obvious to me and only JJ Abrams can overlook in the editing room is the height difference between Old Spock and Young Spock. In one particular scene they stand in front of each other and Leonard Nimoy is a good 2 feet higher then young Spock. No Parallel plot line can fix that crap. JJ Abrams is cheap. All his movies are basically tricks. He keeps the entire plot line of all his movies secret, makes a compelling trailer or two, and then on opening night.... the Movie sucks. Look at his filmography, most if not all of his movies were sold just like that. I sometimes say in my reviews that certain director can do no wrong. Well JJ Abrams can do no RIGHT! I give it a 5 because all in all it was a very entertaining movie, and the opening scene was great. It is not a 6,7,8,9,or 10 like it should be, because of the cheap Hollywood-esk plot line.Like the subject line states: Good Popcorn Movie, Bad for Trekkies I won't be buying this on DVD.",5,1,6,12 May 2009
Akira," Akira - original, thought-provoking, and spellbound
","First let me get the negative out of the way.I felt very strongly that the original American voice acting for it was better then the new 2001 release of the film. The dialog is slightly different and you got more into the characters through the art of voice acting. Makes me appreciate voice acting so much now that I have heard both versions.The movie still has me thinking and I've owned it or over ten years now. THe story is so profound, so deep, it certainly is a moralistic as well as a philosophical movie.This is not an action movie as many Americans sometimes categorize anime (although there is action in it). Nor will you find cute talking animals. This, all in all, is an adult movie, not for kids under the age of 13 in my opinion. One thing you can generalize about serious anime is that their plot lines or stories are so complex and don't usually focus entirely on a single characters. More times than not they focus on idea's rather then people, which makes for a good thinking movie.Without giving away the movie, this is a serious film about morality and technological achievements in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo, which is always interesting to me since there are many post-apocalyptic movies coming out of Japan and the fact that they are in a very real sense, a post-apocalyptic nation, having atoms bombs dropped on them at the end of WWII.This film does stand the test of time",10,0,3,4 August 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Classic QT - what did you expect?
","Certainly, this was no Pulp Fiction.But this was classic QT.What do I mean? Very long drawn out dialog usually about a movie, with a mild climax filled with dark humor.Not historically accurate, which I like.Brad Pitt was extremely funny as were many of the characters. Also the movie, about 50-60% was subtitled, which I also liked. People in the theater were falling asleep left and right, so its not filled with action as one might think.Think Deathproof, with all the talking leading up to some huge climax, weather you thought the climax was worth all the wait is up to you. If you're a QT fan, then it probably was worth the wait, but after reading the negative comments, I can understand why people thought this was overrated.Anyway I liked it, but not for 10$ at the theater, more for rent or for a cheaper ticket price. Certainly not QT's best work, I would say I would rank it behind Kill Bill with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs being number one and two.",7,1,6,14 September 2009
The Prestige," Under the Radar 10 star movie
","Hugh Jackman Is on fire!!!! Every movie he touches is great. A spectacular actor. Chris Nolan (the director) is also on fire. All his movies seem to be fantastic. This is not really a period piece even though it is set in Victorian England, but told not through the repressive usual way, but from the way that Victorian England was also a time of great amazement, People all over sought amazement as this time was the height of science and therefore pseudo-science. This movie has the best storyline ever. the Storyline is itself a magic trick and you won't know how it comes together till the end and when you do, it's a bit scary. A great movie totally under the radar of great blockbusters but I wouldn't have it any other way.",10,2,3,28 May 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," Weak-sauce Certainly no Batman Begins or Dark Knight
","OK, First the GOOD:My favorite part of the film was the beginning when Steve Rogers was a frail weakling in stature but had a huge heart. That entire chapter was great. You know, Chris Evans I am convinced is a great actor. Hugo Weaving is awesome as a villain, always was, always will be. The mask he had on was very cool too, the makeup or whatever it was, was not so much that it restricted his expressions. Hugo Weaving is one scary dude. The graphics were fine and the entire supporting cast was very good. Now The BAD: Well...the story which had a lot to cover was stuffed in a 2 hour movie when it felt like they either should of changed the script of the movie entirely or made the movie a 3 hour movie. There was no big Hero versus Villain showdown, or maybe there was but I blinked and seemed to have missed it. I didn't feel like there was that big huge action scene that you see as apart of the format in other action films. This movie just fell flat with the stuffed story and basic outline of the movie.Special note: I was most afraid of all, that this movie would be way too Pro-America (Think Team America but serious) and with times like these I am glad that was an aspect of the film that I 'didn't' feel they went over-the-top with. So like with all the other action Summer Movies of 2011, don't expect too much, but see it if you want to support these fine actors.",Null,1,5,10 August 2011
Watchmen," A rated 'R' Comic Book movie great for Adults
","This was (dare I say) perfect in the comic book movie genre. I absolutely loved all the characters especially Dr. Manhattan. There was a scene that certainly is not intended for children's eyes, but its not over the top, meaning I have seen worst graphic scenes in Indiana Jones, notably the villains death scenes at the end of each.They stayed true to the comics and I love the universe they created with Nixon in his 5th term in office, etc.There are a lot of flashbacks and I think flashbacks within flashbacks but its all good, it wasn't confusing to me and flashbacks within flashbacks can be very confusing if done wrong. The director did a great job wielding the story lines together in 3 1/2 hours. Superb visuals and a fantastic storyline, I was a little upset at the end of what happened to one of the characters, but hey can't have everything.I would recommend this to anyone who loves comic book movies, however this isn't like your normal comic book movies, as it is grittier and darker then most (think of Sin City or 300). It takes the genre in a different direction much like how Chris Nolan did with the recent installments of Batman (which I also love).The movie deals with current themes in our world today and for that I think this makes the movie timeless. I certainly can't think of why all the hatred for this movie. Not only did it completely stay true to the original comic, but it did this in such stylized fashion. I have decided that Zack Snyder can do no wrong. I think most people didn't like this because they thought it was boring. Well if a good story must have non-stop action then this and most movies are not for you. There is great action, yes, but there is also depth to the mythology of the Watchmen world.",10,39,69,19 June 2009
Dark City," Dark City and Director cut review
","A great Sci-fi flick by any standards.Like many great Sci-Fi epic movies you will not find invading aliens or a big monster to kill in this movie. Great Science Fiction is usually based off great ideas.This movie has an original premise and is simply a great scary movie w/o the monster stuff or bloody axe murderer slowly walking down the hallway. In Fact, as far a cliché's go, this movie intentionally inserts many cliché's from different genres as part of the plot.I originally saw the theatrical release, then bought it, then saw the director's cut recently.I must say for me; for which one was better, I could say there is so little difference in the two versions it won't make a big difference. I would also say, see the theatrical first because, contrary to what the director believes in his commentary, the prologue in the beginning is a good insert for grabbing the audiences attention and sucking them into the Dark City mythology. Plus, there are also technical foul ups in the directors cut, such as some bad ADR, that wasn't in the first release, extended sequences that don't serve a real purpose in character development, (I'm thinking of the extended scene where Jennifer Connely's character sings an entire song in the Director's Cut as opposed to a short sequence in the theatrical release. Anyways is a great thinking movie with all the good Sci-Fi horror feelings you would normally get. A cult classic for sure, and for movie collectors; get this one and show it to your vulnerable friends during Halloween like I do... Cheers.",10,1,2,1 August 2010
X-Men: The Last Stand," I don't what everybody is talking about. part three saved the first two
","Look, the way I feel is that Brian Singer ruined the story with the first two films. Simply put; Bad writing, bad direction, Bad everything except the acting. He's never read an X-men Comic he said so himself in the BTS. Part three was magical. 1st... great musical score to capture the emotion, 2nd... Storms ridiculous hair was fixed so it didn't look like a weave! 3rd... BEAST!!!!!4th...Hugh Jackman Like always, great acting as well as Haily Barry5th...compelling drama married with compelling score.6th... The action scene in the end was EPIC, also the Xavier, Magneto, Jean Grey stand off scene was also EPIC.Everybody needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something and get of Brian Singer like he's some Comic Book God. He doesn't even read comics and he ruined Superman as well. This was a great movie and just forget about the first two movies. The third was and still is the Best out of the Trilogy.Another thing is people never watch till the end of the credits which reveals more storyline, people just walked out thinking everyone is dead and all this nonsense.",9,0,3,17 August 2007
Gran Torino," Mainly for Clint Eastwood fans
","Despite all the rave reviews, which I don't understand, I didn't think this movie was made very well. It was mainly the acting and the writing. CLint Eastwoods performance was great, but everybody else was bad. From the Young preacher to the main Hmong characters the acting was forced and you could tell that all these people had never done a movie before, which according to IMDb is mostly true.Right off the bat you saw the actor who played the preacher was of considerably less caliber than anyone else in the scenes. The Hmong actor during a climatic scene with Clint Eastwood seemed fake, forced and just not very good. Again if everybody was that bad maybe no one would have noticed but they were up against a veteran actor, so it was quite noticeable.The writing was a little empty and it didn't take a guru to see right through the plot.I know Clint Eastwoods movies are plain movies, usually low budget, with fresh new actors, and simple plot lines, with the exception of his latest WWII movies and Mystic River. Although the revenue must be very high for this movie cause I'm sure it was dirt cheap to make considering all the aspects, but this certainly isn't a must see even if it is his last acting movie.",5,55,98,7 July 2009
Transformers," A very good version, but Micheal Bay?
","The movie Transformers is this summers movie box office hit without a doubt. Its amazing to me still that Harry Potter can compete with this 80's toy/cartoon epic. As far adaptation goes this movie hit the mark..well as good as you can get it without ruining the story of how Transformers came to Earth in the first place. The action was even better. A little hard to tell the difference between some Decepticons and some Transformers transformed into entirely different things then its cartoon version, but who cares! For me , I would much rather see Megatron as a flying jet looking thing then have Micheal Bay, who directs this piece, defy physics and have Megatron transform into a hand held gun that any human can carry. Which brings me to my point why this movie with all its intense fighting and awesome screenplay adaptation, only gets a 9 out of 10. Micheal BAY. Micheal Bay is notorious for making great movies just good enough for the theaters and thats it. Micheal Bay has certain elements that appear in almost every one of his movies. He has cameos of a comedic nature, usually done by a black guy or foreigner and there almost never THAT funny. For example Eddie Griffen in Armegedon and Bernie Mac in Transformers He uses the same shots as he does in other movies, for example the 360 pan-around shot in Bad Boys 2 Pearl Harbor, and now Transformers. Point is this. If you were a fan. You'll love this movie as it is authentic, If you don't like Micheal Bay because of his cheese!!! But like Transformers as a kid...well then you'll give this movie a 9",2,1,3,16 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Christopher Nolan can do no wrong (concise)
","If you have seen the First Batman movie by Christopher Nolan 'Batman Begins' and you loved it, you'll love 'The Dark Knight' even more.Batman Begins and its sequel THe Dark Knight have the same format, meaning story telling etc, even the Title isn't shown to you until the end like the previous film. However THe Dark Knight has greater suspense, greater acting, dialog, and even the action is more impressive. Not just mindless Batman fights but when Batman beats up those unfortunates, it means something to the viewer. Overall this was the best Batman ever! Honestly it was hard to judge The Dark Knight against Batman Begins because they were both nearly perfect as they ought to have been. The Joker was the best character in the film. Heath Ledger performed him with such absolute authority and villainy that it freaked most people out in the theater. He plays and absolute anarchist and Heath brought many laughs from the audience. My Guess is that his Joker will be known as 'THE' joker to judge all other against for all time. It is a tragic shame that this arch villain will not be in any of the other movies at least not played by Heath Ledger, who of course died in early Janurary. Two face: Anyone who knows the comic stories, Harvey Dent becomes Two-face and I must the mere sight of this villain when he actually turns will make your stomach turn. Never have I imagined TwoFace looking the way he did in this movie, that in itself was a grand achievement. The story overall was intelligent and well made. Even my girlfriend who holds the claim that when action movies start playing the action, 'thats the boring part', and although she is a real reference to those that are not into action movies, even she thought this was the greatest movie this year. Plan and simple the best comic book movie franchise in movie history, not because of dynamic action but by excellent story-telling and memorable acting.",10,3,7,22 July 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," Much respect to Kubick...but
","I love Stanley Kubricks movies, absolutely love them. Overall I felt this film was trying very hard to say something but fell flat. It is an ambitious attempt.First the GOOD:I love the idea of the film which was an exploration of one man's journey into sexual and moral discovery. Midway through the film you get the sense of an amazing thriller is being unleashed before you. I love the idea of Tom Cruise and Nichole Kidman (who were married back then) doing this movie. The movie had the dry subtle humor that Kubrick was known for and I loved that part of it. Now the BAD: There were a few problems with the film. My biggest annoyance was the dialog. Many times in the movie the dialog would go something like this: person:1'Take off your clothes' Tom Cruise: 'Take...off...my...clothes'So many times in the film someone would speak to Tom Cruises character telling him something and he would just repeat what they said back, but very very slowly. After the 5th time it got very very annoying. The score was decent except for the single piano playing during suspenseful moments. A single piano note playing over and over again. Also very annoying.The plot of the film had great aspirations but after the midway point I thought the suspense was built up in perfect Kubrick style but there was never any conclusion. Also Tom Cruises character had the most random thing happen to him that it seemed unrealistic and more or less unrelated to the plot of the movie. Some of the scenes I felt went on for way too long like Nichole Kidmans crying scene when her husband came back form the party.I have tried very hard to like this movie and was among the excited fans waiting to see this movie when it first came out.",4,0,2,1 August 2008
The Fountain," A sad, intellectual, visually entertaining movie
","If you know and liked the director and his movies (Pi, Requiem for a Dream) then this movie you'll probably love. If only one thing that can be said about this film, then its attempting to 'stand the test of time.' This is not only an interesting story and superb acting cast and I mean Superb!! This movie also is a visual spectacle, yet they used very little CG in this movie. In certain climatic parts of the movie where you would swear there was computer graphics...there isn't. This is one of those movies where as soon as you see it you'll want to see it again to make more sense of it or to get more meaning out of it. These movies are rare. The storyline is difficult to follow and requires the audiences vulnerability. If you try to connect the story lines (and there are three of them) you 'll miss everything else. Just sit back relax, watch, enjoy. This is nothing like Requiem for a Dream or Pi, it has a heavier feel to it, though it is not as depressing. This movie has gotten a lot of negative responses from those, I believe, were expecting an epic Sci-Fi movie from one of the great directors. However The trailers were completely misleading and it is better almost to have never have watched them. This is a fantasy movie. I read that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchet were supposed to play in this movie. On this note Hugh Jackman should have been the first and only choice. Brad Pitt is good for looking cool and thats about it. (sorry to all you B.P. fans)Not everyone will like this movie, in fact, I find it hard to believe that this will get a wide viewing, as it is not a commercial film. It is an art film, a discussion piece, a beautiful poem about the fragility of life and the idea of forever.",9,1,3,28 May 2007
The Wrestler," Good but not Great
","This movie was filled with dark imagery, pain, and suffering. Some of the scenes in the plot seemed to me forced, as if someone on set said, 'and now cue the crying scene!' Everyone did a great job acting and the female lead was naked throughout most of the movie, which was surprising to me. Anyway the movie was short and bitter and certainly not a feel good movie of the summer. However Darren Arnofski's films are never feel good movies with the exception of maybe the Fountain which I am a huge fan of.I would recommend this movie as a back up movie in case you didn't get the one you wanted in Netflix or whatever, but this movie isn't going to knock you off your rocker, nor will it make you wanna wrestle.",7,0,1,19 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Without a doubt the best Prequel
","The Revenge of the Sith had spectacular special effects and fight scenes, which Steven Spielberg himself helped make. Now nothing, in my opinion, compares to the Obi-wan/Darth Maul fight scene in Phantom Menace, but the good thing about this Star Wars installment is that there are many fight scenes that come close. Anikain Skywalker looks convincingly evil althroughout this installment which should put to sleep Hayden Christensens's harsh critics in Attack of the Clones. There are some scenes that can leave one feeling if George Lucus really prepared his actors (which I've read he didn't leaving his dialog coach to prepare his actors). Some scenes, the dialog is so bad you can almost see the actor turn to stone such as the introduction scene of Darth Vadar and his, 'NOOOOOOOOOOO!' That was kind of cheesy and left me wondering if it was done digitally. I personally felt the writing was poor. George Lucas writing love scenes was the worst. With lines such as, Skywalker: You are so beautiful Padmae: Only cause I'm so in love Skywalker: NO, no because I'm so in love with you Padmae: So love has blinding with ...and so onThe real treat in this film is the spectacular special effects and possibly the fact that this is the darkest of all Star Wars movies. It's still a must see but the Star Wars that came out in 1977 that changed pop-culture forever is gone and all we have are these technically pleasing to the eye moments.",8,1,2,26 May 2005
Defiance," popcorn movie, meaning okay but not great
","This is the first time I've noticed other people who've posted comments that have had the same general opinion about a movie.Good but not great.On to the review: Acting - The acting was generally pretty good. I believed in the East European accents that most of the actors faked. Daniel and Liv are very good actors and they held there own. But in my opinion it was the script and the direction that made the lines the actors spoke seem, forced.It was sorta hard to care about or in other words become emotionally invested with the actors.Everything else was mediocre e.g. Direction, DP, editing, etc.For me, I truly believe the WWII Nazi, concentration camp, killing Jews, theme has been sooooo overplayed in America to the point its cliché'. Plus on top of that cliché is another cliché, the stealing from the rich to give to the poor Robin Hood cliché'.I will say that the movie was good at exploring the morality of people who are hunted by the Nazi's. Many times in the movie the debate of ,'whom should we steal from to survive,' came up, and this was good for the story.I like Daniel Craig and that was the main reason for me seeing the movie. I gave it 6 stars, for a good story, for actors I wanted to see, for the moral twists and turns. I gave it bad marks for its cheese factor and obvious clichés'.Its simply an okay/sorta good movie but it certainly its not great.",6,2,6,24 July 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes looked dumb, but I watched it and Loved it.
","When I saw the trailers for this film and I saw all the fight scenes I instantly thought they had ruined the movie, because for me, thats not how I saw Sherlock Holmes (as some pit fighter).I like the two actors Downey Jr. and Law, but I couldn't get over the fight scenes.Well then I saw the film, like 2 years after it came out.I loved it. Everything about it. But for me mainly, I loved how damn funny the film was, I found myself cracking up every 5 minutes or so, it really was that funny. It was smart, quirky and yes those fight scenes are totally explained and fall perfectly within the Sherlock Holmes mythology.The film had a great theme as well that most of my Sherlock Holmes experience had, and that was; there was always a battle between the supernatural versus Holmes' logic and reason.If you felt the same as me and were stand-offish with the film because you may have felt they betrayed the mythology....WATCH IT. It will blow you away, make you laugh, and have you begging for a sequel.",9,1,2,2 February 2011
Prometheus," Great Graphics, poor writing, actors did what they could
","I am always wanting to delve deeper into mythologies, and so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get into the mythology of Alien. To sum it up, the movie was a large disappointment. First the good: The graphics. The graphics were great. The acting was pretty good but they had to deal with the horrible script.Now the bad: The script was awful. The plot holes were so numerous, so ridiculous, it was just awful. For example, Prometheus is the story of a trillion-dollar mission to discover the origins of human life on a distant planet. Basically, this is supposed to be the greatest exploration undertaken in the history of mankind.So who do they send? A gaggle of fractious goons whose collective scientific nous is rivaled only by that of the Three Stooges. Within minutes of touching down (conveniently beside the only 'man-made' structures on the planet, ala 1960s Star Trek) the 'scientists' are yanking off their helmets, on the basis of 'it seems fine to me', dipping their fingers into strange organic ooze, and lugging a severed alien head back to an unquarantined spaceship in a sandwich bag.The music was my first indicator that this movie was going to be bad. It was music fit for Gladiator not a Sci-Fi genre movie. Very poor choice.",6,4,10,11 June 2012
Iron Man," I don't think so
","When I watched the Iron Man trailer, I figured okay this movie will be entertaining and something fun to see. Granted I love most of the comic book movies of recent times (except Electra, Daredevil), especially the revised Batman series, and the X-men series and Fantastic Four is getting better with each movie. Well I guess I was somewhat right. You could say I was somewhat entertained but I don't know maybe that would be an exaggeration.First the Bad: Characters we're not developed at all, so you really didn't care about anybody except for Tony Starks.Terrible plot. SPOILER: Terribly developed fight scene between Iron Monger and Iron Man, which just made me sick. All that build up for such a lame fight scene in the end. There was nothing special about it, it was short, and there was nothing to fight for by that point. Iron Man could of walked away to fight another day and we (the audience) would've lost nothing. And I know this is taboo in the comic book world, but I couldn't really believe that Tony Starks build the suit in a cave out of spare parts, something should've been done in the writing process to make it more believable.Also and this part bugs me but maybe I'm overreacting. I thought the movie was way too Pro-American Military, too Anti-Islamic, and the scenes with Afgani terrorists, well they just looked too Hollywood for me. If they were really going to use today crisis in Afganistan as a plot device I would've appreciated if they could've made it more realistic then just getting some darker skinned actors (clean shaven) and called them Afganistan terrorists. This movie re-enforced so many negative stereotypes.Okay that was a lot of bad and I did give it 7 outta 10 stars, so here's the good: Robert Downey Jr.If it wasn't for his quick witty responses and overall comic relief this movie would've bombed, because every movie nowadays has great FX (and it was great) you can't really say 'the movie was good cause of the special effects'. Also the comedy by other actors was very funny. I did laugh out loud a few times.So If you think, like I do, that The new Batman Series is perfect, and X-men series was pretty damn good, and believe that comic book movies need depth and realism as well as fantasy, well I would rent this movie once not expect too much and hope the sequel will be better.",7,2,4,30 October 2008
Blade Runner," I'm sure it was good for the 80's, but thought it was boring
","Certainly the most over-rated sci-fi film of our time. OK it looked quite distinct in 1982, and the image of a grim future with giant TV screens high above the city was memorable and somewhat accurate for what we see in todays Hong Kong.Plot? There's not much to say, the film contradicts itself many times and the weak and limp tale crawls along.Acting? Ford's OK, Young is pretty and dull, Olmos is cool, twenty years before being cool fighting Cylons, and Hannah is sexy but hopelessly out of her depth.Apologists for Scott's fiasco blame the evil 'suits' for messing up their Lord's film but in truth the directors cut is worse than the original movie.The sound is badly mixed too.",6,53,114,2 January 2008
Heat," Heat will stand the test of time
","One of the best movies of the 90's.In this exciting thrill ride, good and evil battle it out. But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today. 'Heat' carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted. From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) 'Heat' grabs you and pulls you in. This is a true film masterpiece.There is about an hour and 45 minutes of set-up and the climax comes which lasts a while and then you have the showdown with two legendary actors, which I guess is also a climax. The score of the film is outstanding, especially in the end of the film the music is grabs your soul and makes me teary every time.This is a classic and should be viewed by everybody.",10,4,8,7 August 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Slumdog Millioniare is a must see
","Danny Boyle has been a favorite of mine since I saw Trainspotting, since then he's gone on to make many masterpieces(Trainspotting,28 Days Later, The Beach and Sunshine).Slumdog Millionaire comes out of nowhere and it could very well be his best film yet and one of the best films of the decade. Much like Danny Boyles work, Slumdog Millionaire has fast cuts, artistic Cinimantagraphy, and a fantastic soundtrack. The raw style mixed with the amazing locations make this film one of the most cinematic experiences you'll ever see. The Sound is perfect, I haven't heard audio like this in a while and am getting the soundtrack immediately. This film needs a Oscar nomination for the soundtrack, it sounds that good. The film itself gives a wide host of emotions; It's funny, sad, thrilling, and happy, basically a very enjoyable film that deserved the numerous Oscar nominations.There are some difficult scenes to watch for the faint-hearted, scenes that make me sad for the slum children of India and everywhere else, and when the movie was said and done, one does feel like the movie had an intense happy ending. Danny Boyle who has touched on many film genres now has made a true masterpiece with Slumdog Millionaire.",10,0,3,30 March 2009
