The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project (7/10)
","Sometimes a great creepy horror movie, doesn't need crazy special effects or well calculated jump scares, sometimes all it takes is simple story and creepy atmosphere. The Blair Witch Project is possibly the most brilliantly marketed film of all time. The public was attracted to the ambiguity of the film trailer and website, as well as the insisting notion that the events occurred were in fact real. The film also revolutionized how many horror films slash their budget by going to hand-held cameras. It's never an ideal way of film-making,some movies can pull off a shaky camera, some can't, however the Blair Witch Project absolutely does. The big bug-ab-boo is the acting and dialogue are extremely monotonous. Characters are also unlikable at times. The Blair Witch Project is a wickedly creepy, bare-bones film with a dark, soulless ending that will stick with the viewer.",7,0,0,21 October 2017
Alien 3," Alien 3 (6/10)
","After a surprising beginning to central characters in the previous film, the main character Ripley is thrust onto a planet run by prisoners. As a huge fan of David Fincher, seen almost all his movies, it's pretty safe to say Alien 3 is at the basement of his list. It's pretty obvious executives were in the way of what probably could have been a really good movie if Fincher had total reign on the script and finances. After a surprising beginning to central characters in the previous film, the main character Ripley is thrust onto a planet run by prisoners. Some of the characters on this planet were annoying and unlikeable while others that had potential seemed to bite the dust pretty fast. Alien 3 does have loyalty to the franchise but the film pales in comparison to its predecessors. The ending couldn't roll around fast enough knowing that the predictable sacrificial twist was about to occur and it should have put a lid on the franchise (it doesn't). It is a shame, David Fincher, a filmmaking genius, wasn't even good enough to save the franchise, and it was bound for Alien to start going downhill.",6,2,3,25 August 2016
Gremlins," Gremlins (7/10)
","Having seen Gremlins a long time ago as a child and liking the film, it was probably best to revisit it to see if it holds up today. The story (mystical creature bought in Chinatown, dad making clunky inventions) and silly dialogue are typical for the time period, it's a total 80s cheese fest. The biggest mistake that the Gremlins filmmakers made was the lead casting of Zach Galligan, who had stiff acting throughout, and Phoebe Cates who hadn't yet blossomed into the actress she would later become. The movie gets good when the Gremlins action picks up and they start causing havoc in town. The little creature's mannerisms and scheming antics are the most memorable aspects of the film. Aside from the fact it's still a fun Christmas movie, Gremlins has slightly too much hype as a classic. Can't deny though, Gremlins is by far the most impactful small creature film to date.",7,1,3,11 December 2016
10 Cloverfield Lane," 10 Cloverfield Lane (7/10)
","Not often has there been a sequel with such a difference in characters, plot, and filmmaking such as Cloverfields'. Certainly almost everyone watching the movie knows a monster awaits outside besides the lead character Michelle. She faces a different monster, one that has taken custody of her and keeps her as company in his apocalyptic safe rooms. John Goodman plays his part perfectly as an insane doomsdayer and Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job as the lead actress as well. The film is very dialogue driven and accounts for a tug-of-war of feelings on what safety really is in this case. 10 Cloverfield Lane is an intense psychological roller coaster that builds up to the final scenes. There were some aspects of the ending film that was disappointing but will be left unsaid for spoiler purposes. Solid unconventional sequel!",7,3,4,11 July 2016
It," It (9/10)
","A basic common fear among many people on the level of spiders and tall heights is creepy clowns. Stephen King's second adaptation of It, really illuminated that fact by becoming one of the top five highest grossing films in 2017. It became one of the most successful horror, let alone R rated movies of all time. Whether it's the concept of creepy clowns, the climate of what people feel in 2017's society, or the fandom of Finn Wolfhard, it is unbelievably hard to fathom that an old Stephen King horror adaptation would kill the box office this hard. However, the simplest answers are usually the right answers, It, really is that great of a movie.The film's strength lies within its young cast that really played their roles to a tee, bouncing lines off each other naturally. The character's stories are also key, building great character development in the first half of the film really made the viewers attached to their hero's when they came face to face with Pennywise. The Pennywise makeup was top-notch and introduced beautifully with a classic scene right in the beginning. The only gripe of It would be that too much CGI was used for some of Pennywise's scenes. Most importantly, the film's lasting message, that conquering fears gives people will power, was so strong it was really inspiring in a way. The second adaptation of It, shocked everyone, scared everyone and will be remembered as being one of the best horror films of this decade.",9,1,1,21 October 2017
Se7en," Se7en (9/10)
","Seven, also known as Se7en, is headlined by a brilliant all-star cast, which include Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, R. Lee Emery and Gwyneth Paltrow. The cast being near perfect, would not have been together if it wasn't for the stellar script and lead director, David Lynch. David Lynch film-making was ruthless creating a dismal atmosphere, always raining, with crummy settings in dark places.The film probably considered by most a thriller crosses the line into the horror genre with chilling scenes and grotesque images. The suspense is top-notch having a first time viewer on the edge of their seat from the start. When the film does end, the viewer is left with a shocking twist, stirring up a few emotions that aren't often felt when watching a movie. Viewers may bicker if Se7en can be labeled as a horror film or not but what they won't argue is the greatness, being the film itself.",9,2,3,9 August 2015
Underworld," Underworld (8/10)
","Great fantasy/horror films are hard to come by and one of the great ones that comes to mind is Underworld. The introduction of Kate Beckinsale explaining the war between vampires and lycans (werewolves) was a tremendous start and hooks the viewer right off the bat. Len Wiseman really put his heart into this story, the craft is just exceptional. Kate Beckinsale was a great choice to play Seline, the lead vampire and main character. However, it was Bill Nighly that really flourished in the film playing the stern ruthless head vampire, Viktor. Great action sequences are prevalent throughout and even though it doesn't hold up today like it did in the early 2000's, it's still a great film. If you haven't seen Underworld you have really missed out on a great action, fantasy, horror flick.",8,4,6,14 August 2016
Dawn of the Dead," Dawn of the Dead (2004) 6/10
","As a stand-alone zombie movie, Dawn of the Dead is an action packed nail biter after an initial watch. However, after consideration, there are massive plot holes and characters making the wrong choices throughout the film. At one point, all the characters were in a gun shop with zombies surrounding them and then all of a sudden, a terrible cut, and they all end up in the sewers. How does that happen? The girl going on a suicide mission for a dog was incredibly dumbfounding too. The 'Dawn of the Dead' remake is widely entertaining and worth a rent or look on television but it fails in a lot of potentially credible spots.",6,0,2,10 July 2015
Alien: Resurrection," Alien Resurrection (4/10)
","The fourth installment to the Alien saga is a film that should absolutely never have been made. The movie was solely made just to cash in on the title without having any creativity or narrative to the stories franchise whatsoever. The thought of bringing Ripley back as a clone is just an outrageous plot line to begin with. Ripley's character completely 180'd in attitude and spirit and other characters in the film are weak, stale and have little character development. The vast majority of this movie is just a big stretch including the ending. One redeeming aspect of Resurrection is that it is ruthless and seemed to have good gore effects that were disturbing and were of quality to the first two alien movies. Otherwise it should be seen as part of the entire franchise but will likely leave you disappointed.",4,3,4,25 August 2016
Shaun of the Dead," Shaun of the Dead (9/10)
","Brilliantly deliberate in its writing and dry satirical jokes, Shaun of the Dead is a top of the horror-comedy genre. Jokers are subtle and littered throughout, viewers should easily be able to pick up something new each time watching Shaun of the Dead. The uncomfortableness of Shaun's life scenarios ends up being a tremendous set-up to the end of the world, zombie outbreak. The dialogue is terrific, script and story is flawless and the characters are all purposeful and well-developed. Simon Pegg and Nick Forst are a great duo, hilarious and complement each other's performance perfectly. The gore is definitely there still and it's definitely unforgiving to the characters in the film, even the likable ones. Shaun of the Dead is a classic and a film that will go down as one of the most memorable and quotable horror-comedies.",9,2,5,29 August 2015
The Babadook," The Babadook (8/10)
","Rarely, do horror movies that are all hype before release, or seen by the masses, actually deserve the acclamation, but The Babadook absolutely does. This Australian horror thriller bases its fright from a mysterious children's book called Mister Babadook. Once the mother, played by Essie Davis, reads the babadook book to her horribly behaved son, Noah Wiseman, all sorts of chaos ensues. At first it's hard to tell if Mister Babadook is real, or it's the characters imagination, but as the movie continues the pieces to the puzzle start getting put into place. It's unfortunate that the ending left out a few pieces leaving an empty taste after watching it. Anyway, the scares and tension is definitely there in this movie and is quite unsettling at parts. The direction is stellar, it's an original script and solid performance. As a longtime horror viewer it's hard to say movies scare me anymore but Babadook sure did make hairs stand on end and create some tensed up muscle moments. Make sure you don't miss out on The Babadook!",8,4,8,30 April 2015
Blade," Blade
","The film Blade, is one of the very first all-out action vampire movies that are often seen today in modern horror films. What's great about Blade is the likability of the two main heroes, performed by Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson. Stephen Dorff also was tremendous as the ruthless Deacon Frost, that was the leader of a group of young club-going vampires. The filmmakers didn't shy away from their use of gore and take advantage of the R rating being an extremely violent movie. The gore could have even been better though, if the filmmakers didn't use the cheap trick of dissipating vampire ash when struck with silver. There are many horror films out there that are pretty brainless, but Blade is brainless in its own way by having top-notch fighting sequences and a story that's fun and easy to follow. It's slightly outdated, but nostalgic in the fact it's one of the very first, fast-paced superhero movies, which are all too common place nowadays.",8,1,2,26 July 2015
Zodiac," Zodiac
","One of the few extraordinary, gifted directors continuing to make quality films is David Fincher. The man knows how to piece a story together and make long periods of dialog interesting. Watching Zodiac, I was so drawn into it that I really felt like wanting to solve a murder mystery. I can understand why Robert Graysmith dedicated his life to searching out the truth of the Zodiac killings. The initial kills are horrific and hooks the audience immediately, which leads to the chase. Just watching the film I knew the story had to be historically accurate because it seemed like I was listening into private conversations that happened years ago. The trio of stars, Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo were superb characters and likable. The film is very long but worth the watch if your patient enough to watch an amazing truthful story about a serial killer. Not enough do we get a high budget accurate representation of real-life killers. Zodiac (9/10) is a sleeping gym that I recommend to all.",9,1,1,12 May 2015
Cloverfield," Cloverfield
","Cloverfield 6/10 The opening twenty minutes of the film might hold the dullest scenes in any movie I've seen. The party provides nothing to the movie, no good character development, interesting dialog or purpose. It's a terrible party I'd leave in real life. Getting past those initial scenes and into the bulk of the monster film is well worth the wait. The fact that the monster is never shown right away is a great tease, which builds up the wanting to see more throughout the film. The monster itself looks realistically clammy and the little monster fleas that come off of it are a great little twist into the equation. The destruction scenes by the movie are great and so are the military action effects. The story, dialog, and action scenes improve as the movie goes forth. Although the ending is typical of a giant monster film its filmed well and tops of the hopeless feeling perfectly.",6,1,3,4 February 2015
Silent Hill," Silent Hill (7/10)
","Hardly, does a video-game adaptation turned into a feature length film ever sound like a plausibly successful quality project. Silent Hill breaks that boundary by acquiring three well-established actors in Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean and Laurie Holden. Radha by herself delivered an outstanding performance as Rose Da Silva, a role she doesn't get near the amount of credit to which she deserves. Her believability on screen and glowing presence, just totally carried the film, I really couldn't say enough. Another aspect of the film that was endearing is it seemed the story stayed true to itself as if it was in the video game. The faceless creatures were downright terrifying, and Pyramid Head was certainly intimidating. Barring some unnecessarily dragged out scenes and confusing dialogue towards the end, the film Silent Hill is a good sleeper film that delivered a solid story and enjoyable time watching.",7,0,0,12 May 2018
Blade II," Blade 2 (8/10)
","Blade 2 had a lot to live up to with the successful entry of the initial Blade movie. Luckily for audiences Guillermo del Toro was at the helm of the project and he did not have a letdown. The action is way better, it is predominately kung-fu with less evaporation of vampires. Although the story is not as strong as the first, the plot incorporated the 'keep it simple stupid' motto as its method, which really payed off. Blade's (Wesley Snipes) team is a strong mix of characters played by heavy hitters, Norman Reedus, Donnie Yen, Ron Perlman and again, the great Kris Kristofferson. The sequel has a more gore, more action and more sinister villains compared to its predecessor. Blade 2 hits on lots of film genres, which makes the movie a great, unique watch for any film viewer.",8,0,1,17 November 2015
Alien," Alien (9/10)
","It's hard to even imagine how a film like Alien is even conceived conceptually. Yes, it's obvious that Alien is inspired by works such as Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey but it takes the visuals and that lonely concentrated feeling of outer space to another level. Ridley Scott did a tremendous job in directing only his second feature film about a group of ordinary people being terrorized by a hideous breed of monster. The creativity of on how the monsters evolve throughout its life stages is just as intriguing as how they look aesthetically. The movie develops itself quite nicely, a slow start with great details pertaining to the character but it's not long after the gory mayhem ensues. Also, it's safe to say one of the most memorable scenes in horror cinema occurs in this classic, Gothic alien horror movie that is a must see.",9,1,2,6 August 2016
Predator," Predator 9/10
","Films that teeter the line of brutal horror and all-out action are hard to come by but Predator is an exception. Predator is absolutely my favorite alien horror film made over the likes of Alien, The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I can't say that Predator is better because those are some rock-solid classics but Predator does get criminally overlooked and probably isn't looked in that category to most. Special effects for the late eighties were risky but it worked perfectly, the camouflaged movements of the Predator were original and powerful on screen. Predator itself, seems unbeatable and a worthy villain to be remembered in the horror genre. The kill scenes were all graphic, not showing mercy to anyone, and definitely unpredictable not knowing who the next victim would be until their character came to contact. The characters were strong and defined thanks to an incredible cast that made this seem like an actual deadly in combat rescue team. Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham and Arnold had their hoaky one-liners but they were often funny and quotable. Definitely check out Predator for a great theme song, well thought out storyline and special effects, and relentless gory action.",9,3,3,13 August 2015
28 Weeks Later," 28 Weeks Later
","28 Weeks Later has way different feel than 28 Days, but I did feel like the sequel lived up to my expectations and served justice to the original. This version has way more action in terms of death scenes and it seemed way more gory. Right from the beginning the action and scares occur with little development of the characters. I like Jeremy Renner a lot and thought this was the kick start to his phenomenal career since he was so great in this. The story jumps ahead a lot, which is why 28 Weeks Later gets an 8/10 but it didn't fail to entertain at any point. It's only a matter of time before 28 Months Later comes out, and I can't wait for it!",8,1,7,7 June 2015
The Thing," The Thing (9/10)
","In numerous interviews John Carpenter has pointed to Howard Hawks as his favorite director, so it comes no surprise that he wanted to pay homage to his film 'The Thing from Another World'. Thus, Carpenter directed The Thing, alongside a stellar team behind the scenes that include Rob Bottin (special effects) and Ennio Morricone (music). Kurt Russell stars as the stoic R.J. MacReady, a scientist stationed in remote Antarctica. The setting, Antarctica, has really never been seen in a horror film, so with all the snow and cold, it provided a great hopeless dark atmosphere. The cast around Russell were also suburb with all delivering great written dialog. The story is brilliant, leaving the viewer's clueless to who might potentially be the shape shifting monster and what will be happening next. The uncertainty of The Thing stays all the way to the ending scene, which is still talked and dissected by horror fanatics to this day. The Thing is a classic horror, recognized as one of John Carpenter's finest. Watch it if you haven't seen it now!!!",9,2,6,30 April 2015
The Village," The Village 7/10
","As good as The Village is as a film, it's pretty apparent to see here that M. Night Shyamalan started to stray away from his strong suit, the supernatural, and go towards different story lines. The Village is extraordinary just from a casting standpoint; bring the likes of Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt. Each character had to be precise and some highly articulate in order for their roles to be pulled off perfectly. It's not often to say that I felt Phoenix's character lacked while Bryce Dallas Howard portrayal of Ivy Walker was terrific. Shyamalan was lucky to get such a great group of actors and actresses for his film, along with his consistent partner and great composer, James Newton Howard. Howard's score for The Village is just as good as it was in Sings and it really sets the tone and mood for the story. Shyamalan tried to pull off a twist like The Sixth Sense with many clues, and short cut-off scenes to the past, but it just didn't get the hype he hoped for. It's not a horror film which many people thought because of what the trailer represented but an unsettling drama with only a couple intense moments. I'd still recommend The Village to anyone but I also see why so many people were disappointed because it isn't the typical Shyamalan film by any means.",7,1,2,7 June 2015
Split," Split (8/10)
","When it comes to Split, M. Night Shyamalan has put questions to rest if he can ever create a thriller with terrific built suspense or a thoughtfully written twist ending. The story really anchored the film, which relied on intricate dialogue, scene by scene and a limited cast to sell it. What's different about modern Shyamalan thrillers compared to his past ones is his comic relief that he's been able to successfully apply. The ensemble of personalities James McAvoy portrays was engaging, each well-crafted and had their own distinguished presence. Along with McAvoy's performances, Anya Taylor-Joy was also marvelous as the introverted lead female with complexities that were well built. Split establishes an anxiety-filled atmosphere, fluid build up to the end, with little mercy shown to characters and viewers. Split is well worth the watch, and without spoiler, its recommended to watch Shyamalan's early thrillers beforehand.",8,3,10,4 June 2017
The Hills Have Eyes," The Hills Have Eyes (8/10)
","Director Alexandra Aja had a lot riding on his own Hills Have Eyes film and he certainly did not ruin his rep by remaking this film. In the grand scheme of the horror genre, Aja's Hills Have Eyes is one of the best remakes out there. It was true to the original with a very similar plot but it added some different twist and cool scenes along the way. The town scene, which is a unique idea to the nuclear subplot, is very gory and tense. One negative thing compared to the original is how deformed the mutants are. The mutants are too unrealistic looking, with no distinguishable features, the original gave a way better image. Also, the last five seconds is a big let-down, it's low class sometimes how horror movies try to make it interesting and set itself up for a sequel. Still, the 2006 modern version of The Hills Have Eyes is a big hit and one of the better horror films of that decade.",8,1,3,18 September 2016
The Shining," The Shining (9/10)
","Stanley Kubrick is considered one of the top directors for a reason, his adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining is a tremendous piece of cinematic history. The scenery and music in the opening credits are eerily horrifying right off the bat. The character of Jack Torrance would not have a better role if it wasn't done by Jack Nicholson. The small supporting cast of Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers and Barry Nelson were equally great in the film. Although there were terrific performances, the real star was The Overlook Hotel and the masterful way Kubrick portrayed the evilness of the place. The film develops itself very slowly and builds itself into complete insanity. The horror scenes that include the twin girls, Room 237 and the stairway are all freaky and expertly shot. When the ending comes it does come as a shock because the vast majority of viewers have no idea what just happened. It takes multiple viewing and additional research to completely understand King's and Kubrick's deranged story that is The Shining.",9,3,6,29 August 2015
Aliens," Aliens (8/10)
","Although, Aliens is an exceptional movie, its puzzling to notice the abundance of fans that think its surpasses the original. That said, James Cameron remained remarkably faithful to Scott's masterpiece with its dark, violent tone. The characters although more memorable than other films, seemed to be a bit too dramatic and colorful, which takes the viewer out of the doom and gloom atmosphere. While the writing was down in that aspect, the story-line was really tense and flowed really nicely. What Cameron is best known for though is his visual effects made for the big screen in theaters. The action sequences, space scenes and scenes with the queen bee were incredible and still hold up today. Aliens is highly enjoyable but from a film standpoint, and fits great in the Alien universe, it just can match the girt Scott's film had.",8,1,3,25 August 2016
The Exorcist," The Exorcist (10/10)
","Where is it to even appropriately start with a film like The Exorcist, it transcended the horror genre and is often regarded as the scariest movie to the majority of casual viewers. The film's pacing is excellent having the advancement of tension and buildup with incredible pay-offs. The character development and story are so detailed and entertaining that the first half of the film left no dull scenes of dialogue. The latter half of The Exorcist was nothing short of amazing. Normally, the payoff scenes are shorter quick pieces of reel towards the end but The Exorcist had long drawn out Exorcism scenes with terrifying moments. All the actors and actresses themselves performed phenomenally. Linda Blair playing the most innocent girl to start really leaves a lasting impression when the voice of the demon comes out of her character. Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller however, go often under the radar with the film, which is too bad since they really brought the real fear of what they saw to life. The Exorcist is without a doubt a top five horror film in my book and in my top twenty across all genres.",10,1,1,3 December 2015
Saw III," Saw III
","Saw III is a good contributing part of the Saw franchise since it keeps intertwining the previous films together like a puzzle itself. The story lines and twist endings with Saw III is definitely the reason to watch this relatively sub-par horror flick. It's quite remarkable how well each twist is, even though the viewer might be able to sniff some of them out, they keep on providing surprise after surprise. The actors in the film are alright, some really bad script dialog and overacting (especially Shawnee Smith) but not unbearable. The Saw films however are best viewed in sequential order in short periods of time to pick up past characters, subplots and tidbit hints. I'd have to say Saw III (6/10) didn't hold up to its previous successors but it manages to be a fun ride.",6,0,1,14 January 2015
The Conjuring 2," The Conjuring 2 (9/10)
","Rarely does a big time director of a hit horror movie come back and make a direct sequel to his work. James Wan seems to take up this challenge and it's refreshing that he has the desire to continue his original story with another solid outing. It almost seems that The Conjuring franchise is quickly becoming on the level of the The Exorcist franchise, in terms of story and film quality in the possession genre. Wan's ability to create a frightening film relatable on a human level is a remarkable talent. An initial strength of The Conjuring 2 is how topical the premise is to the actual landscape of paranormal perception. For example, an important part of any real-life exorcism is the doubt that the vast majority of people view towards the subject in question, in this case a girl played by a good upcoming talent, Madison Wolfe. The Conjuring 2 outlines the media scrutiny towards exorcisms very well and also the genuine nature and belief in the paranormal field by strong grounded people. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are simply incredible in these roles, flat-out polished acting chops and never wilt once on screen. A well-written story, strong cast and crew and hair raising scenes and dialogue it's really not that surprising to see The Conjuring 2 crush at the box office as well as critical reviews.",9,0,0,29 October 2016
Alien vs. Predator," AVP: Alien vs. Predator (4/10)
","Although it is nice to see the two most ruthless alien species on film going at it, there lies the first issue of the film. Both film franchises chronological timelines are now ruined with the xenomorphs being exposed in the Predators timeline (modern day). It's clear to see the Paul W.S. Anderson and the writers did have somewhat of an interest in maintaining some faith to the original alien franchise by casting Lance Henriksen as Sir Weyland, since the robot Bishop is supposedly made to look like his maker. Aside from that aspect, the storyline is completely silly with the only entertaining facet that the Predators and Aliens are facing off for the first time. Action sequences are prevalent and done rather well but there are no characters of redeeming value and the ending was a big miss. SPOILER: The notion that our main character was able to survive by 'picking sides' was very, very stupid. A 4/10 rating is being pretty considerate but there is a part of myself, remembering back as a young viewer at the time AVP was in theatres, that I did enjoy seeing both alien species being on the big screen together.",4,0,0,6 August 2016
28 Days Later...," 28 Days Later
","Even though it's technically a virus, I think grouping 28 Days Later into the zombie category is still acceptable since it's the majority of people in an apocalyptic world turn into unconscious deadly beings. I'd rate 28 Days Later in my top five favorite horror flicks, close to #1, just because the atmosphere feels like reality and a dreadful mood sets in every time I sit down and watch it. The movie has fantastic camera work, characters/acting, plot, effects, theme song, cinematography and just about all aspects of film-making I can think of. Everybody I've watched it with has loved it and 28 Days Later can be watched multiple times, definitely can deserve a 10/10 rating.",10,2,2,7 June 2015
It Follows," It Follows
","Every so often, there is a non-mainstream horror film that comes out with a lot of buzz and actually delivers. It Follows is one of those films, having a totally original script, which is flat-out brilliantly made. The characters are genuine and moving giving the audience an emotional attachment, seeming that we possess the same fear they are facing. The fear being a slow-stalking entity that persistently follows a person after intercourse. The anti-sex message is painfully strong, even if the director/writer, David Robert Mitchell intended for it. Mitchell's scenes were deliberate and perfectly written and acted even the chaotic scenes that were fast paced. Credit also has to go towards Maika Monroe, the stunning lead actress had a very 'girl next door' appearance, played her role flawlessly. The rest of the cast were great fits and contributed excellently but they didn't hold a torch to Monroe. Another attribute of the film that was fresh and provided a hard hitting downer of an atmosphere was the music score. The score is fantastic, and started whenever a chase occurred or was just about to, very similar to Michael Myers and the Halloween theme song. The film progressively gives clues to what will eventually happen throughout the course of the film but it's still not as predictable as one would think. It Follows is going to go down as one of the best horror films of this decade and a must watch.",9,4,12,26 July 2015
Get Out," Get Out (7/10)
","There hasn't been one horror movie in the past decade to get the critically acclaimed ratings and reviews as Get Out. As this review is being written, Get Out has an impressive 8.3 rating on IMDb and an astonishing 99% on rotten tomatoes. Those types of numbers scream potential Oscar nominations for Get Out, and by receiving this type of notoriety, the potential of the horror film/genre getting to an Oscar platform again would be monumental. However, even before seeing the film and understanding the current political environment in America, it is apparent the social message is the primary reason the film is being universally praised by critics.It's also clear the best way to view Get Out is in theaters as it feeds the crowd with a variety of emotions that include laughter, intensity, and awkwardness. Jordan Peele did marvelously in his directorial debut, shooting scenes with comedic value swiftly into serious, nerve- wrecking sequences. Peele also have written the story-line came up with a very original concept of a social horror film. Racial dialogue was constant throughout, not subtle in the least, with most lines hitting well but there were a handful of duds. The cast did great with their dialogue and were well rounded in terms of performances and screen time. It seemed supporting actress Betty Gabriel as Georgina, really stood out in her role, executing it perfectly but Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams were spectacular in their leads too. Possible spoilers ahead... The biggest faults in the movie came in the last fifteen-twenty minutes, when it took a different direction in its plot and drew sharp comparisons to a past horror film, Skeleton Key. The very ending was however the most questionable aspect taking the easy, cherry route instead of a darker, more socially compelling ending. There was an opportunity to hit big with the ending but it missed. Get Out is an amazing original movie, great for the horror genre, and will be cheered heavily for possible Oscars. However, does it deserve the high acclaims it currently has? Answer is a definite no.",7,3,9,18 March 2017
The Number 23," The Number 23
","As an initial viewer back when The Number 23 was shown in theaters, there was a lot of anticipation that was only let down afterwards. Now after seven years, I thought I'd give The Number 23 another try since the plot escaped my head and the twist was forgotten. Unfortunately, there was no change in my feelings for this film, which is utter disappointment. There was so much potential for this film with its cool plot idea and solid cast. The plot line of everything in your life (birth date, address, social security, driver's id, etc.Â…) all adding up to the number 23 is an interesting concept. However, a non-interesting side story between pseudo-characters in a book with all around hideous acting and writing really shot down any possibilities this film had. The film did have the properties to make a great horror thrill but instead I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of The Number 23.",4,0,1,31 October 2015
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place (9/10)
","A Quiet Place is an astonishing accomplishment from a first-time director, John Krasinski, who is most known for a role in a comedy tv show. This kind of versatility in Hollywood is rare and more people like Krasinski are needed to really resurrect the film franchise. A Quiet Place proves that original content can still crush in the box office, not just the standard, shallow Superhero films that get pumped out. In fact, A Quiet Place is continuing this trend of horror films achieving immense success in the 2017-2018 era, a prospect that remains extremely exciting.
 The film itself does a fantastic job in setting a bleak mood and feeling of isolation for the world we know today. This feeling of isolation is felt in one way by the great cinematography, which include an abandoned town, forest and farm, all incredible sights on the big screen. The pace of the film is skillfully worked, having a decent amount of quicker cuts and edits to start and then prolonging scenes during the intense ending. Very well done film, a must watch!",9,3,7,13 May 2018
The Evil Dead," The Evil Dead (7/10)
","Evil Dead 7/10 If one were to go out and search top ten horror movie list on the internet, you'll without doubt find Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead appear more often than not. The Evil Dead is made cheap, free and easy at the same time introducing some interesting camera tricks to create great suspense. The camera zig zagging throughout the woods at just above ground level chasing its actors still holds up as a great technique. However, there is a bit of absurdity to the nature of this possession when trees rape and lamps talk, all the while taking itself really seriously. There is also an overuse of gore with bodily fluids and blood that didn't match well with the bright colored demon makeup. Many scenes dragged on for too long and some of the actresses really overacted the crazy all-out horror scenes. If it wasn't for the innovative camera work, creepy location and Bruce Campbell, I'm not sure we're talking about this cult classic that still gains popularity to this day.",7,0,1,23 March 2017
Saw II," Saw II
","Saw II is an outstanding follow-up to the first Saw that introduces the fantastic Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. Jigsaw's reasoning is a bit absurd but his methods and traps are always unique and cringe worthy. The story revolves around Detective Eric Mathews played by Donnie Wahlberg who did a terrific job. The mix between the two different sub-plot, the first being Mathews and Jigsaw, with the second being the house prisoners was intense and well-written. The characters inside Jigsaw's house played the script well even though it was noticeable that these weren't polished actors and actresses. The traps inside the house were the best part not knowing what the traps were capable of and seeing how the characters reacted to them. With the first Saw having a shocker of an ending, the second had to set the bar once again. There was multiple twists at the end, some the viewer could easily see coming and a couple that were surprising. Watch the Saw series in a row because it's a continuous story, you won't be disappointed with Saw II (8/10).",8,0,2,13 January 2015
From Dusk Till Dawn," From Dusk Till Dawn (9/10)
","Loaded with kick-ass actors and actress with the likes of George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek and Quentin Tarantino there is little doubt that this movie was going to be a bust. The film starts out as a gruesome dramatic action but tailspins into an all-out bloody vampire flick. Given the horror element of vampires, Robert Rodriquez casted a few well-known supporting actors (Danny Trejo, Tom Savini and John Saxon) to solidify his horror film and attract audiences. There are an abundance of quotable, laughable lines throughout that is only in Rodriquez and Tarantino type fashion. The film is a wild ride, with a load of bullets and exploding corpses. The one let down from this being perfect is the awful CGI but that can be looked past. From Dusk Till Dawn isn't the traditional vampire flick but it does offer a whole helluva a lot, a fantastic flick to put up your feet and kick back to.",9,1,3,29 August 2015
Saw," Saw
","The movie Saw is something that comes around every so often like the Blair Witch Project. A small budget film that gets tremendous buzz because it is done with such intelligent screen play and shock value. Saw is known for its incredible ending twist that no one saw coming and it blew all the audiences away. Aside from that the great characters, the acting and dialog is a little lackluster between the two leading men, Dr. Gordon and Adam. The writing, well thought out story and death trap scenes really put Saw over the top and being worthy of a great horror film. It was one of a kind until it came out and totally original that James Wan will be acknowledged for until the end of his directing days. Saw (9/10) is a creative, twisted low budget gem that is a can't miss.",9,11,16,25 August 2014
Zombieland," Zombieland (8/10)
","After Shaun of the Dead, zombie-comedies came out in full force with a lot of good flicks and a lot of bad. Perhaps the #2 zombie-comedy according to many since Shaun is that of Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland. Right off the bat, Zombieland presents a comedic rulebook in order to survive a zombie apocalypse. The film's quirky writing style left a lot of possibilities for fun characters and interested actors to fill roles. The casting managed to snag some big A-listers, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Wood Harrelson, and Abigail Breslin. The story is centrally focused on the four characters named after U.S. cities, and follows them along as they venture out looking for safe havens. The gore and zombie action is top notice, lots of good original dialogue but most of all it's truly a funny flick. Take a look at Zombieland in case this was overlooked, it wouldn't be a regret.",8,1,2,16 December 2015
Psycho," Psycho
","I think it can be safe to say Psycho is Alfred Hitchcocks most notorious film and for great reason. He had a gift of such pristine direction and writing that will suck the viewer into the movie like I'm virtually watching the events happen. Janet Leigh's character rules, a strong women already, but just completely tail spins into situation after situation that digs herself deeper and deeper. It's at the Bates Motel were the consequence of her mistakes plays out, which then focuses the movie on Norman Bates played by Anthony Perkins. Perkins role of momma's boy with insecurity issues was played to a tee. Terrific acting, writing, dialog, pacing and memorable scenes all take place in Psycho. In my heart of hearts I feel Psycho may just have been the most meaningful movie to the horror genre.",9,2,3,24 August 2014
The Witch," The Witch (9/10)
","The Witch is set in New England during the early European settlement period of America in the 1600's. The dialogue of the film was too written well considering the dialect people spoke back then. At one point the English subtitles had to be turned on just to properly follow some of the things the characters were saying. The characters with the tough script really pulled off this horror film with high emotions and uncertainty of faith, something obviously very important to people back then. The atmosphere of the film was very hopeless right from the get-go creating uneasiness and a somber mood. The film steadily gets better and more disturbing, leaving the viewer mystified to many different aspects of the story-line. The Witch is very much a psychological horror building up to the climax, which had a fantastic pay-off. The ending is very chilling with a couple memorable scenes and bits of dialogue. The Witch, in my opinion, is a highly recommended film and it's also shown by many positive reviews surrounding it.",9,3,5,10 July 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Rosemary's Baby 7/10
","Try this, compare Rosemary's Baby to all the horror movies that came out in 1968 and does anything hold a candle to this film's production, cinematography, flawless editing and high level acting? Speaking only to Roman Polanski's film-making, it's really a shame that there isn't many risk takers to produce a good written horror film like him. Mia Farrow does a terrific job in portraying a normal outgoing city-dweller who turns into a paranoid, helpless mess. It's in the details of Farrow's reactions and elegant line delivery that really make some scenes chilling. Rosemary's Baby however, does fall short in really memorable moments and an impactful ending. There's no doubting it's a superbly made film, but there is blandness as the film draws out longer, longer. A little over-hyped possibly, but still a must see film.",7,3,7,21 October 2017
30 Days of Night," 30 Days of Night (8/10)
","David Slade directs a grisly vampire tale about the town of Barrow, Alaska being under siege by a group of vampires. Slade holds nothing back when showing the carnage of vampires feasting on townspeople and the writers weren't shy about writing who dies either. Inspired by a graphic novel, 30 Days of Night has appeared to turn the vampire genre into a darker more sinister approach. The film is great in the fact that it has times of suspenseful tense dialogue and moments of complete chaos. The Russian vampires are greatly barbaric and having a strong frightening screen presence. The cold blistery atmosphere was a great setting and created the sense of complete hopelessness being stranded. Characters and acting seemed to be more on the weaker side, nothing terrible, but they rode the line of mediocrity. From that one negative setback 30 Days of Night is still one of the better movies of the late 2000's and a good purchase for any gore/horror fanatic.",8,1,2,29 August 2015
Army of Darkness," Army of Darkness (8/10)
","The hilarious performance by Bruce Campbell in Army of Darkness has got to be the reason for his massive cult following. His one-liners are so off the wall and quotable that replay value will always be existent with this film. Army of Darkness, unlike the previous Evil Dead movies went light on horror substance and built itself around Ash and a plot that is seemingly close to the book, Lord of the Rings: Two Towers (since the movie wasn't out yet). However, there are so many memorable scenes that the flick really stands out on its own even with the insane amount of parodying the film took. In my opinion, Army of Darkness is the best in the trilogy and should be accepted in the comedy genre just as much as it is in the horror genre.",8,2,3,30 November 2015
Scream 2," Scream 2 (8/10)
","The genius of Scream 2 is the callbacks and homage it pays to former horror sequels and to the original Scream. Scream is iconic for its self-reflection, its placement in the horror genre, and the rules, which horror movies abide by. My own set of rules to a great sequel differ than the film. The rules are simple but are sadly not achieved as often as they should be. First, continuity, have a story that follows the events from the original or just limit the plot holes and have it be logical. Scream 2 passes the first rule with a big check-mark. Second, bring back major players, which Scream 2 exceeded at by starring Neve Campbell (Sidney), David Arquette (Dewey), Courteney Cox (Gale), Jamie Kennedy (Randy), and Liev Schreiber (Cotton). The third and final rule is a trickier concept to handle by filmmakers, which is maintaining the same atmosphere that made the original fantastic but to steer the story in a new direction. Wes Craven fulfilled all these rules, especially the third by preserving the character's personality, comedic moments, music theme, film style, and general mood and feeling of the film. Craven also connects the dots perfectly beginning to end on killer identity and motive and concluding with a satisfying ending. For all the reasons above, if I was in a film class and had to name a sequel that surpassed its original, one that would definitely come to mind is Scream 2.",8,2,2,21 June 2016
Jaws," Jaws 8/10
","Synopsis: On the shores of a quaint northeast town, a gigantic man-eating shark is causing police chief, Martin Brody, some major issues. The mayor is breathing down his neck not to close the beaches because of upcoming summer profits on the 4th of July weekend. Thus, a team made up of the police chief, an oceanographer, and a deep sea fisherman is set to go after the ferocious great white shark. Review: When the film Jaws came out, the film became a massive hit and was highly praised by audiences and critics alike. Nowadays, it almost seems that Jaws is becoming under-appreciated and not taken a granted for. There's a lot to like about Jaws but it makes sense to start out at the beginning, when the lovely skinny dipping bombshell, happens to be the first victim to the ruthless sea beast. The panic in her eyes felt real and this kill immediately hooks the viewer into the movie. The music in this scene, by John Williams isn't necessarily catchy or explosive, but it's perfect for the underwater shark perspective, when approaching the swimmers. The film is steered, no pun intended, but the three high-profile actors, Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw. Schneider was fantastic, seemingly a normal everyday person, while on the other hand, Robert Shaw played an eccentric, beloved shark hunter sensationally. In the latter half of the film, when only these three characters are shown throughout, are easily the best parts of Jaws. Shaw gives great line, after great line and the special effects for the shark improve in each underwater scene. It's only when the shark is seen above water to be a little fake. Each Spielberg film I see of his is different than the rest, since I feel he has no agenda and no style to filmmaking. He's an unique director that put together a marvelous, transcendent film, Jaws.",8,3,6,20 May 2015
The Conjuring," The Conjuring (9/10)
","The quality of mainstream possession or ghost movie has been so watered down as of late its hard to have hope in this sub-genre. However, there is an exception and it comes to us by nobody other than James Wan who keeps pumping out phenomenal films. The Conjuring is undoubtedly a modern day classic that is closest in likeness to The Exorcist. While the feeling of The Exorcist is present, the writing and horrific scenes are completely different. The Conjuring uses techniques what are known nowadays as jump scares but these are successfully placed and truly scary. The pace is mixed up beautifully with well delivered character dialogue and intense chaotic scenes, which at times is completely off the charts. Check out The Conjuring if you haven't already, very much worth a purchase to a DVD collection.",9,0,0,25 June 2016
Scream," Scream (7/10)
","Wes Craven officially supplemented himself on the Mount Rushmore of horror once his nontraditional slasher film Scream hit theaters. Utilizing a style of writing and dialogue that is closer to that of a midday soap show than a feature film, Wes Craven successfully pulled off a fun 'who done it' slasher. The film does a great job at poking fun of horror clichés and has an aspect of unpredictability. Even though Neve Campbell is the star, the show stealers are Courtney Cox and David Arquette with great character development and chemistry. Scream isn't perfect by any stretch but does a good job at being different, thrilling, intelligent and entertaining, everything to look into for a horror flick.",7,1,1,25 June 2016
Prometheus," Prometheus (7/10)
","What is fascinating about Prometheus was the lead up and hype that happened before the film came out. The film is better off on its own and not knowing that it is a set up by Ridley Scott to his Alien franchise. There is obviously a lot of disappointment to the film because the direction of the story is definitely a little strange. However, there is just too many quality aspects of the film that are not to be overlooked. The performances by almost the entire cast is fairly pleasing especially by the star power of Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Charlize Theron. Also, the visual effects are truly top-notch, would have certainly been best to see this in theatres. The story-line is a bit convoluted and a lot of questions were left unanswered but it is totally unique. Ridley could have definitely done better with a more defined plot structure but it is still enjoyable and makes the viewer look forward to whatever is next in the new series.",7,0,0,14 August 2016
Halloween," Halloween
","Ultimately, not only is this my favorite horror movie but it very well may be my favorite movie. It's a timeless classic that should be a must watch for any future director. John Carpenter created a masterpiece using excellent pacing and film styles to create different and interesting scenes. The music that John Carpenter wrote himself is brilliant and provides a chilling atmosphere throughout different stages of the film. And who can't think Michael Myers is generally creepy to the limit. The GOAT, greatest of all time (horror villains sake). The characters of Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode are every reason to view this movie too. Watch Halloween, you won't be disappointed.",10,2,4,26 October 2011
The Sixth Sense," The Sixth Sense (9/10)
","The older and more experienced I get in life, the more I seem to appreciate The Sixth Sense. M. Night Shyamalan took his time writing and directing this tremendous work of film. I find it cornball when people proclaim movies as art that are all about themes and expressionism, but I'm starting to understand that feeling after my most recent Sixth Sense view. Every time I watch the movie there seems to be something new I pick up that I didn't previously notice. The story is so solid, there isn't one crack in it. To go along with such a fresh screenplay was an amazing cast that headlined Bruce Willis, which I don't think it's crazy to say that this is his best work. The Sixth Sense is more of a drama than a horror film but when the ghost scenes occurred they were terrifying and unforgiving to the viewer. On a lighter note too, it was nice to see the family dog make it through a scary flick for once. Definitely check out The Sixth Sense (9/10) because it is still worthy of a watch even if you know the twist.",9,0,1,10 May 2015
The Purge," The Purge
","The Purge is a terrifying theory, which was set up by the American's demented national government to allow all crime for one night. I paused the movie at the beginning thinking what if this was a real life scenario. I don't think I'd make it too long. Anyway, the cast is so-so, not a big Ethan Hawke fan but he was better than the majority. The movie was directed and written well, a tad predictable at parts but still held my interest. I loved how insane the criminals were, skipping , singing and laughing, truly bizarre and creepy. The most kick ass part of the Purge is definitely the last fifteen minutes of the movie. It's not a shocker of an ending but it was the right ending. Check out The Purge, definitely worth the time for a fan of horror movies.",7,0,1,8 January 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Nightmare on Elm Street
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is probably Craven's most gritty film that went all out on some frightening bizarre scenes and borderline outrageous storyline. However, the movie works well, so much that Freddy Krueger has become a widely known killer villain. The introduction of Freddy was nearly perfect showcasing a great character. The supporting cast around Krueger was subpar but its easy to overlook. The pacing is great being fast in the beginning, releasing tension in the middle leading up to a great ending. The music is solid, atmosphere could have been a little better but overall a terrific movie in A Nightmare on Elm Street. A must see for horror fans.",9,0,0,27 October 2011
Life," Life (7/10)
","The outer space setting for a horror/sci-fi film was a common theme in 2017, notably Alien Covenant and Life. Seeing the influence, the original Alien had on Life is as plain as day. This aspect knocks down Life's originality pegs somewhat and leaves the story-line very predictable especially at the very end. However, Life has a couple film aspects that were great to see on screen. First, this was truly an all-star cast lifted by Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson. Second, the monster's CGI was excellent, and its own origins and development are interesting to the story.
As a whole, the storyline and editing where managed with precision and made the movie very fluid and go by fast. It'll be exciting what to see Daniel Espinosa has for the future after his first big budget film he successfully managed. Although Life didn't manage to be on the same level as Alien, the film is still strong and worth viewing.",7,0,1,28 January 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," The Cabin in the Woods (8/10)
","Cabin in the Woods takes your typical campy horror plot, a bunch of kids, on a weekend getaway, to a remote cabin and flips everything you know about that, upside down. Joss Whedon and Drew Goodard wrote an incredibly creative horror script, well not according to Peter Gallagher, but in terms of the onslaught of prequels, sequels, and remakes, it does. The cast for this movie was near perfect. Richard Jenkins's and Bradley Whitford's characters were hilarious, yet ruthless. The five youthful campers are headlined by Kristen Connolly and Chris Hemsworth, a couple big catches, since some might consider these risky roles. Once the movie's plot turns away from its 'Evil Dead' type feel, into its whacky rabbit hole, the movie starts to get extremely interesting. Horror generalizations, elements, monsters, one liner's and themes are poured into this zany film. Is Cabin in the Woods ridiculous, yes, is it absurd and deranged, yes. Is it also a fun thrilling ride completely original to anything recently, most definitely! There are a few questionable eye rolling moments but overall it's a great watch, perhaps one of the top films of the twenty-tens decade.",8,0,4,30 April 2015
Donnie Darko," Donnie Darko 8/10
","Having been late to the party on Donnie Darko for nearly fifteen years, I was excited to finally have the moment, where the film was in hand, and I was in the right mood. Donnie Darko met my expectations and took me for a wild ride. Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic as his typical suave but awkward persona that he plays in a lot in his films (Zodiac, Prisoners). He happens to be so good at that type of role I keep hoping he brings it every time. I was also really impressed with the supporting female cast that included, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Jena Malone and Drew Barrymore. All of them were absolutely terrific. Behind the camera, Richard Kelley, who I have never heard of before this film, was impeccable at keeping the viewer in the dark but also entertained. The story was a tad hard to follow for myself at points, just because I'm not a whiz at understanding paradoxes and time traveling but I still managed to hang in. I now know why Donnie Darko (8/10) is such a cult favorite that is intellectually driven and obviously very original.",8,0,3,12 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," Alien: Covenant (7/10)
","The contrast between Prometheus and Alien are very distinct in terms of the story, tone, characters, just about everything by Ridley Scott was done different. Although unsettling bleak feeling of Alien probably can never be recreated by Scott, his work on the Alien franchise is all that I am interested in seeing at this point. Thus, Alien: Covenant was pretty anticipated, seeing how the new story begins to bridge together Scott's two other films.Covenant starts off with a couple remarkable scenes involving a Fassbender flashback towards Prometheus and a chaotic scene of deep space turbulence. The imagery of the space scenes are still on the level of what one would expect to be in a Star Wars film. Covenant did a good job in adopting old concepts and keeping them fresh with different takes. The brutality is also there with intensity and gore not being an issue. Where the film falls flat though is the cast around Fassbender, there's just no other way around poorly delivered dialogue and forgettable characters. In the film's conclusion, there is also a big problem with predictability as the ending can be seen coming from a mile away. Covenant is a solid addition the franchise but in no ways does it knock the ball out into space.",7,1,4,21 October 2017
Evil Dead II," Evil Dead II (7/10)
","Considered by many, Evil Dead II is the most fan and critically received film in Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy. From my point of view, the sequel's big mistake was not adjusting the script to follow Part 1 with more fluidity. I get the fact that the movie rights weren't given to Raimi and the first half of Part II was a more simplified recap but there was seriously nothing wrong with the first Evil Dead, it was fantastic and no need rehash it. Picking up where the first film left off would have been a better way to go about it. Aside from that, the film exponentially gets better as it progresses. Raimi does a great job making the film more chilling with better makeup artistry and a well written script. It takes a certain taste to enjoy the Evil Dead movies, so take a chance and its likely you'll find yourself being a part of the huge cult following of Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and the Evil Dead.",7,0,1,28 February 2016
