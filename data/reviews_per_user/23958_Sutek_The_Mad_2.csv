Miracle," 'Miracle hits close to home now, as it did in 1980'
","Amongst the turmoil of politics and unrest all around the world, we see a man who emerges to conquer that turmoil with the drive to mold, temper, and test a group of men that has to be at its best in order to send a message to the world that the United States remains a nation of strong citizens, unable to be dissuaded by a literal nemesis of the time.  This picture is not so much about hockey as it is about the strength of fellowship, comradery, and the feeling and ambition to surpass a barrier that held back a people from success.  The camera work is outstanding; very seldom is the camera so superbly utilized in a film.  This film will not be forgotten during next year's nominations for Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations.  A true credit to Kurt Russell who up until now has taken some tough hits in acting. He does Justice to Herb Brooks' memory.",8,0,0,8 February 2004
From Hell," A fitting title for a poorly developed movie!
","Why is that we are always inundated with movies like this?  Because America is going to hell in a hand basket, the same place from whence this movie came.I do not usually give movies such a poor review, but when did Johnny Depp start doing such obnoxious movies?  I cannot remember the last time a horror film put me to sleep, but this one takes the cake from them all.They could have done wonderful adaptations from the well-written novel by Alan Moore, but something happened when the screenwriters were hired.  It was not thrillingÂ…quite the contrary.  Poor Jack the Ripper, I am sure he is turning in the grave, as are his victims.",5,2,4,4 November 2001
