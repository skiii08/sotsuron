Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Another overrated Tarantino film
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a step above the first Kill Bill because of David Carradine's role as Bill.  However, that is not saying much because the movie goes on so many tangents that are very distracting.   I don't understand why Kill Bill wasn't made into one movie.  I saw no reason that the two movies together could have been cut to two hours.  It spends too much time with extranous characters and situations that I simply lost patience.  None of Bill's associates are very interesting.  I don't care if you have an eye patch, Daryl Hannah, you are not a threatening assassin and don't get me started on your acting.  Quentin Tarantino seems to forget that action movies have to move fast with little dialouge or character development.  Instead we have too much talk and we learn too much about Bill's associates than we care about.  We want to see the Bride and Bill go at it one on one.  Unfortunately, it takes too long for us to get there.  We want to see the associates disposed of quickly and move on to Bill.  5/10 for its stylishness but fatally overlong.",5,6,9,10 August 2004
Miracle," Great
","Being only 6 years old when the miracle on ice occurred, I had little memory of it.  Miracle takes you back to a time and place that was not so long ago, but feels like a century ago.  A time of hostages in Iran, long lines at gas stations, and the Cold War.  It was very different than even the world I went to high school in, let alone now (I am almost 30).  Kurt Russell is brillant in the role of hockey coach Herb Brooks.  The film does a good job in how this team overcame incredible odds to achieve the impossible.  Only complaint, it's too long.  9/10",9,0,0,8 February 2004
50 First Dates," so so
","50 First Dates is a watchable, sort of funny but nothing more. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have genuine chemistry. The film's premise, about a guy who falls in love with a woman with no short term memory is not very funny. The movie gets off to a slow start, with Barrymore's father and brother trying to tell her it's the same day all over again day after day. This part of the movie is not believable because sooner or later she would catch on. The second half improves because it has more of Barrymore and Sandler together. Still, I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore. Sandler plays the same character over and over again. I think Barrymore is a good actress who has wasted herself in one mediocre movie after another, such as the Charlie's Angels movies. I think she can do better. A generous 5/10",5,6,15,9 September 2004
Underworld," Disappointing
","This movie was extremely disappointing.  It has an interesting premise, but the movie goes nowhere.  It is technically well made, but that's it.  Who are rooting for?  The vampires?  No!  The werewolves? No!  Why should we care?  Anything from Blade and Buffy the Vampire Slayer series blows this movie away.  Worth a rental, but that's it.",5,0,0,7 January 2004
Spider-Man 2," Outstanding
","Spiderman 2 joins the small fraternity of sequels that surpass the original.Movies such as Aliens, Superman II, X-Men 2, Toy Story 2, and The Empire Strikes Back are included in this group. Like those other sequels, they do not simply repeat the first movie (something I think Shrek 2 did) but develop the characters better. They also introduce new characters. In this movie, they introduce Dr. Octopus who is a three dimensional character. He is a man obsessed with his work to the point of madness. He will do anything to finish his work no matter what. Meanwhile, Peter Parker feels he must choose between his life as Spiderman or be with the true love of his life, Mary Jane. Of course, these two plot lines must intersect at some point. Fortunately, how they do is very satisfactory. The ending does set the stage for Spiderman 3, which I am already looking forward to. Not just a great sequel but the best movie of the year so far. 10/10",10,0,0,30 June 2004
Finding Nemo," Classic Pixar
","It is great to see another classic movie from Pixar.  Finding Nemo is an outstanding film.  It is well animated and colorful.  The voices are well cast in their respective roles, especially Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres (who I have not been a fan of in the past).  In a summer which has seen dark, moody movies like The Matrix Reloaded, it is great to have fun at the movies",10,0,0,13 June 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How To Lose The Audience In Ten Minutes or Less
","The real title of this movie should be 'How Can Two Good Actors Waste Their Time and Talent on a Bad Movie.'  This is an incredibly bad, bad movie.  I cannot believe two of the most talented actors working today, Matthew Mc Conoughy and Kate Hudson, wasted their time on this junk.  McConoughy tries hard, but Hudson's character is really obnoxious.  The movie isn't funny and isn't smart.  Worst of all, it goes on forever.  If you're looking for a date movie, look elsewhere.",3,0,1,2 July 2003
Troy," Very Good, but too long
","This movie is very well done.  I went into this movie skeptical that there would be a new spin on this often told story.  This movie is grounded by excellent performances by Peter O'Toole, Orlando Bloom, and Eric Bana (who I was not impressed with in Hulk).  As for Brad Pitt, he is good but his nonstop 'do I want to fight or don't I' dialouge gets tiresome as the movie goes along.  This movie takes great liberties with previous accounts of the story.  The Trojan War lasted more than 10 years, yet the movie does not have the feeling of passage of time.  It feels like days rather than years pass by.  Also, who lives and who dies and when has been changed around.  I don't know the actress who plays Helen, but she is very beautiful and comes across as a sympathetic character.  That may be why parts of the movie have changed.  I highly recommend this movie.  8/10",8,1,2,16 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Excellent
","I didn't go in to see The Day After Tomorrow expecting to love it, but that is exactly what happened.  I really love this movie.  It throws in just about every disaster film that you can think of (tornados, earthquakes, snow storms, hurricanes) except for asteriods.  The movie may have a far fetched premise (global warming causes an ice age?) but once trouble begins, it never stops.  You are hooked to your seat throughout most of the movie.  I honestly didn't if there was a right time to go to the bathroom.  I hope this movie makes people listen to environmentalists that say that the continued use of fossil fuels may seriously hurt the Earth.  Though this movie is fiction, I do think we need to rethink our energy policy.  Are you listening President Bush and Vice President Cheney?  Note: the actors in this movie playing the President and Vice President who take no action until it is too late bear a striking resemblance to our current President and Vice President.  I think that is intentional and I think it is deserved.  The acting in this movie, lead by the always watchable Dennis Quaid, is above average.",9,1,1,28 May 2004
The Prestige," overrated
","A better title for this movie should have been 'Two Jerks as Magicians.' This movie contained two of the most unlikable characters maybe in movie history. Hugh Jackman and Christian play rival magicians who try to outdo each other. Both sacrifice personally for their actions. Scarlett Johansson play the woman caught between th two. She realizes that both of these guys are jerks. So why does the movie tack some kind of mega happy ending where one character lives happily ever after. This film cries out for a darker ending in which both Bale and Jackman get their comeuppance at the end. If you want a story about magic, watch The Illusionist instead. It is superior to this movie in every way shape and form.",5,4,8,22 February 2007
Ocean's Twelve," Dreadful
","Ocean's Twelve is an unnecessary sequel to the terrific Ocean's 11. What we have here are big movie stars getting paid a lot of money to service a script that is neither coherent or interesting. Did anybody think that these actors needed a script to work with? I guess the movie is about Andy Garcia wanting his money back that was stolen in the first movie and hunts down all 11 of the thieves to demand it back. I knew immediately this movie was in trouble when the setup took too long. Does he really need to visit all 11 to get his point across? So, they reunite and try to do new jobs in Europe. Along the way, they are chased by cop Catherine Zeta Jones. Well, enough about the plot. I stopped caring after a while and what happens next is so confusing, I couldn't write a good spoiler even if I wanted to. Watch the original instead and you'll have fun. Forget this movie.",3,0,0,16 April 2005
Final Destination 2," Bad, bad movie
",This has to be the worst sequel I have seen so far this year.  The opening car crash and the appearance of Clear and the mortician from the first film are the only things I can recommend about this film.  It is basically a rehash of the original.  The filmakers also decided to put more gore into this movie (which I am not a fan of). It has none of the original's cleverness or originality.  Try the original instead.,3,0,2,22 July 2003
The Polar Express," I believe and you will too
","Polar Express is the kind of movie that makes you feel young and dreaming of Santa Claus's arrival on Christmas Eve. A young boy who is on the verge of losing his belief in Santa Claus wakes on Christmas Eve to find a train waiting for him. The destination is the North Pole. Tom Hanks plays five characters in this movie, all of them very well. The movie is beautifully animated. I felt I was on this train going to the North Pole. I love the journey on the train, the smell of the coal, and the smoke from the engine. The message of the movie is that for some of us the magic of Christmas goes away as we get older, some never had it to begin with (symbolized by the young boy sitting in the caboose), and a few who has it for the rest of their lives. I know this by experience. I think I lost the magic of Christmas a long time ago. I doubt I will ever get it back. This movie shows me what I lost and wish I still had. This movie is a modern holiday classic. 10/10",10,2,4,10 November 2004
Closer," good performances, but flat movie
","Can you like a movie where all four lead characters are unlikable? The characters played by Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owens, and Natalie Portman are all selfish and unpleasant. All four actors are very good in their respective roles. However, there is a sense of detachment from these characters. For example, do you really care if Jude Law ends up with Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman (I should have such problems)? The ending is predictably dark, as you would expect it to be. It is easy to see why this well was critically acclaimed, but did not do well at the box office. Clive Owens and Natalie Portman deserved their Oscar nominations for their roles. However, if you are looking for a good time at the movies, look elsewhere. An interesting but wildly overpraised film. 5/10",5,0,0,29 March 2005
Elf," Funny
","I decided to see this movie instead of the overhyped Cat In The Hat.  From what I read, I made a good choice.  I though Will Ferrell was funny on SNL (it has suffered in his absence) and he is funny here too.  I actually believed he was this oversized elf looking for his natural father.  And it turns out to be Sonny Corleone (actually James Caan, the actor who played Sonny in The Godfather though that would be a movie worth seeing).  Many people think Caan is miscast, but I don't agree.  Caan is a perfect cynic to Ferrell's believer.  The other interesting casting is Bob Newhart as an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus.  It's interesting to see them in a movie like this.  See this movie again and again.  7/10",7,1,2,21 November 2003
Barry Lyndon," Good first half, mediocre second half
","Stanley Kubrick's filming of Barry Lyndon has the same problem as another of his films, Full Metal Jacket. The first half of this movie, with Barry conning his way through high society, is good. It is enjoyable to see Barry go from a poor boy in Ireland to marrying a woman with a title. Unfortunately, the film falls apart in its second half. Barry has become selfish and self absorbed. It is as if he were an entirely different person. It doesn't help that his primary foe is his equally selfish stepson. Since neither of these characters is very likable, my emotional involvement in this movie waned. Since this movie is one of those historical epics, we know what happens well before it occurs. That takes away the enjoyment of the movie, especially since the movie's ending is such a downer that you expect. This gets a 6/10 for this mixed bag of a movie.",6,2,11,18 March 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," It's Over
","I have never been a major Matrix fan.  I think these movies needed a much more charismatic lead than Keanu Reeves.  Underneath all the mumbo jumbo, it is nothing more than expensive action movies.  Like in Reloaded, the explanations for what is going on are just plain goofy.  I had to resist laughing out loud.  Some of the action scenes are well done, but they have grown repetitive.  I'm glad this series can be put to bed.  I don't think these movies will be remembered ten years from now.  They will not stand the test of time.*Spoiler Alert*  A major character dies 3/4 of the way through and gives the most boring death speech that I have ever heard.Overall: 5/10 and I think I'm being generous.",5,0,0,5 November 2003
The Village," Very Good
","I don't know what to say about The Village without giving anything away.  I thought this movie was very well done and is definitely an improvement over some other summer fare like Catwoman.  The Village is not as good as Signs or Unbreakable, but it is still very interesting to watch.  Unfortunately, the secret of this movie will be figured by the average moviegoer after about an hour or so, diminishing the movie's impact.  The secret will no doubt disappoint fans of Night's previous movies.  What makes the movie worth watching the movie are exceptionally good performances by Phoenix, Howard, Hurt, and Weaver.  In the hands of lesser actors, this movie would have been overwhelmed by its weaknesses.  My overall score is 7/10.",7,0,0,30 July 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good But Not As Good As First Two
","Terminator 3 has several strengths.  I think the actor playing John Connor is very good.  Claire Danes is very good as the woman caught up in the mayhem.  The movie also has very good action scenes.  Best of all, it comes in at about two hours, which comes as a welcome relief for those who thought movies like 'Matrix Reloaded' and 'Hulk' would never end.  Therefore, I recommend this movie.  However, the movie is not as good as the first two movies, which are classics.  As good as the actor playing John Connor is, he is not as good as Eddie Furlong in the same role in 'Terminator 2.'  I also really missed Linda Hamilton who anchored the first two movies.  The new villain in T3 is not nearly as menancing as the T-1000 in 'Terminator 2' probably because Robert Patrick is a better actor than the one they have in T3.  Finally, I was not crazy about the ending.  I will give nothing away, but it is a real disappointment.  I honestly don't know how audiences will respond to this ending.  I think they will be disappointed.",7,0,0,1 July 2003
"I, Robot"," Good, but should have been better
","I, Robot is a very entertaining movie to watch.  The special effects are top notch and the actors are pretty good.  However, after a few hours go by since watching the movie, you feel like there should be something more. This is basically another cop who has a theory   that nobody believes until it is too late movie.  I have not read Asimov's original book but I would think it would something more than this cliched storyline.  I had the same problem with Minority Report two years ago.  Despite the faults of the movie, I do recommend the movie if you want to see an exciting thrill ride. As for the intellectual questions about man and machine, the Terminator films have gone down this path before and a lot better.  Still, the movie beats that overlong King Arthur flick.  7/10",7,0,0,16 July 2004
The Alamo," Worth the wait
","I've been waiting since fall for this movie to come out.  Since it was delayed from its Christmas Day release, I've been waiting for this movie to come out.  Now that it is out, I can tell you that it was worth the wait. This is a very well done film based on the siege of the Alamo in 1836.  It is amazing that they didn't film it at the real Alamo because the recreation is terrific.  This version is different from the 1960 John Wayne version which was long and long winded.  This movie does not give in to too many speeches about republic.  Of the cast, Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as Davy Crockett.  His Davy Crockett is seen as a three dimensional character that is not entirely heroic.  Davy Crockett has trouble with his own legend and trying to live up to that legend, even if it costs him his life.  Jim Bowie and William Travis are also treated as relatively unheroic people who are slave owners and are looking for a new life in Texas.  Santa Anna is also treated as not just a dictator, but a nationalist who does not want to lose Texas to the Americans.  The film is a bit long, but it deserves a 7/10.",7,4,6,9 April 2004
Van Helsing," Fun!!!
","I can't believe the people who took this movie too seriously.  This movie is a lot of fun.  Granted the movie runs too long and the ending is not really satisfactory.  The movie does move very fast and Hugh Jackman is great as the title role.  I also like Kate Beckinsale as a princess that helps him. The villains are also quite good.  However, if you have Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's monster in the same movie, what are you going to do for a sequel?  I suppose it doesn't matter.  I suggest you go see this movie and ignore what the critics are saying. I give it a 7/10 with a big grin on my face.  Just see this movie and decide for yourselves.   It won't redefine movie making, but it is a great start to the summer movie season.",7,1,2,18 May 2004
Collateral," One of Cruise's best
","Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances since Ron Kovic in Born On The Fourth of July as Vincent in Collatoral.  In it, he plays a hit man who is out of touch with humanity.  Nobody knows who he is, what he looks like, and where he comes froms and he likes that way.  In Collatoral, Vincent kidnaps a cab driver to help him kill five people.  Jaimie Fox is also terrific as the cab driver.  Fox is best known for his comedic work.  Here, he manages to show what a great dramatic actor he is also.  If we didn't care about Fox's character, then the movie would be an incredible waste of time.  Jada Pinkett Smith gives her best performance since The Nutty Professor in a supporting role.  At the end, there may be a few too many coincidences for a moviegoer to take.  Overall, however, it is a strong story with a strong cast that makes it a terrific movie.  This movie is third on my summer list after Spiderman 2 and The Bourne Supremacy for best movies. 9/10",9,0,0,6 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Worth the wait
","The third in the Harry Potter was definitely worth the wait.  I didn't get a chance to finish the book before going to the movie so I cannot comment on how it compares to the book, but I loved this movie.  The film is literally darker than the previous two movies.  There are a lot of scenes where it is raining or snowing outside, did I go into The Day After Tomorrow by mistake? Just kidding.  Anyway, Harry must unravel what The Prisoner Of Azkaban has to do with before he gets killed.  The actors are all superb, particularly the actor who replaced the late Richard Harris as Dumblebore. I like how the main characters are growing up in these movies.  I look forward to seeing more adventures of Harry, Hermonie, and Ronald in Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire.",10,0,0,4 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Worst movie of the year
","The Butterfly Effect may be the worst I have seen this year.  It has good performances and an intriguing story, but all for naught.  The film is too long, too dark, and too depressing.  What were the writers of this film thinking by making a film about time travel in which none of the alternate realities is appealing?  I know Ashton Kutchner,Demi Moore's boy toy, is trying to stretch as an actor, but he is overshadowed by his much better co-stars who are much better.  No matter which ending (the DVD has no fewer than four) you choose, it is not worth going through this grim tale.  If I wanted to watch something depressing, I'll make a movie about my life.  My advice: just talk to a therapist and skip this piece of junk.  You may need therapy after this downer of a movie.  3/10",3,4,11,6 July 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Entertaining
","If you go into Alien vs. Predator expecting a classic like the original Alien or Aliens, you will be sorely disappointed.  You must accept this movie for what it is and not compare it to the others.  It has exciting action between Predator vs. Human, Alien vs. Human, Alien vs. Predator, and then all three at once.  The movie has good production design in which a pyramid contains mazes, secret passages, and trapdoors.  But how this movie got a PG-13 rating is amazing considering the violence.  This movie basically covers the same ground as the previous Alien and Predator movies with little variation so fans of both series will not be surprised. Overall, if you enjoy wall to wall action without too much character development.  As a matter of fact, we don't care about any human characters. They are just there to get killed.  If you go, you probably know what you are getting into.  6/10",6,1,2,13 August 2004
Batman Begins," A great epic comic book movie
","Batman Begins is the best Batman movie since the underrated Batman Raturns. We see Bruce Wayne as a three dimensional character and doesn't just put out which villain will try to kill Batman next. We see the pain that Bruce Wayne must go through to become Batman. He must not only confront his own demons but the demons that are tearing Gotham City apart. This movie best resembles the comic book which it is based on. The cast is perfect with Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson among others. Though the movie is nearly 2 1/2 hours in length, I was mesmerized every minute I was watching. I put Batman Begins up there with Star Wars Episode III and the underrated Kingdom of Heaven as the three best movies of the year in what has been so far a mediocre year for movies. The low box office numbers for this year have been because of the low quality in movies. I think studio executives should look at Batman Begins and see how big budget blockbusters should be made. 10/10",10,1,3,15 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Very funny
","Meet The Fockers is that rarity, a sequel that surpasses the original in quality and laughs. Meet The Parents was not a very funny movie because I thought the joke of Ben Stiller being constantly humiliated in front of Robert De Niro got really old really quickly. There is still some of that in this movie, but here Stiller has help to stand up to De Niro's uptight character. That help comes in the form of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffmann as Stiller's parents. These two appear to be having the time of their lives in this movie. The energy they display gives the movie the boost it needs to be more than a rerun of the first movie. My only gripe is that the film is needlessly long and has an unnecessary subplot involving Stiller's more housekeeper. Other than that, this movie is much more fun than its predecessor and I would rather watch this movie than Meet The Parents. 7/10",7,0,0,1 May 2005
28 Days Later...," Okay but overrated
","28 Days Later has a very creepy first half which depends more on atmosphere than gore.  Now if only the second half were as good.  The movie does not keep up this cerebal part and instead goes for gore.  The fact that the movie has three different endings showed that the director was not sure how the film should go either.  The movie needed to get rid of extraneous characters and cut down on the needless gore.  Overall, interesting but somewhat overrated movie",6,0,1,26 October 2003
City of God," One of the Saddest Movies you will ever see
","City of God about life in the slums of Rio De Janiero may be one of the saddest movies I have ever seen.  The movie shows an endless cycle of kids becoming criminals before they are even 12 years old.  It seems that when these children are 18 years old, they will either be dead or in prison. This movie tells the story of one of the few who managed to get out of the slums alive.  It is heartbreaking to watch children who are 8, 9, or 10 years old becoming criminals because it is the only way they can money for food.  When they get older, they eventually start helping out with the drug dealers.  The police only show up every once in a while and don't do much. The drug dealers pays the cops to look the other way.  So long as no rich people get killed, nobody cares.  This is simply one of the most poignant films I have ever seen.  10/10",10,2,5,14 June 2004
Hellboy," Good
","Hellboy is a good movie.  It is not a great movie.  It is a typical comic book movie.  The world is in danger of another great apocalypse.  The best reason to watch this movie is Ron Perlman as the title character.  He is funny and charismatic in the role.  He make the movie watchable.  The story is delightfully silly.  The Nazis with the help of Rasputin open the gate to hell, or another dimension, or whatever it is.  Hellboy comes out and is raised by the government.  He travels around the country in a garbage truck to combat evil.  Meanwhile, Rasputin returns with his henchmen to try to reopen the gate using Hellboy.  Everybody got that!  If you suspend disbelief, then you will enjoy this movie.  I enjoyed this movie and it is not too gloomy that some comic book movies are.",7,0,0,2 April 2004
The Incredibles," Incredible!!!
","The Incredibles is simply incredible (sorry couldn't resist). This is a very entertaining movie and great to look at. It is a terrific premise. A superhero couple, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, is forced to retire after facing lawsuits from people they saved. Mr. Incredible is in a dead end job at an insurance company. However, he still wants to be a superhero. A mysterious millionaire contacts Mr. Incredible to be a superhero again with assignments for him. Who is this mysterious person? A villain from the past or a fan of Mr. Incredible? Or is both true? I like how Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and their children all have superpowers. The last half hour is non-stop action and excitement where you don't want to go to the restroom. See this movie again and again just like the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life, and Finding Nemo. 10/10.",10,1,2,5 November 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Moulin Scrooge
","Don't let the so-called movie experts fool you. This movie is the biggest piece of garbage ever conceived.  Nicole Kidman is the most overrated actress in movie history.  She does nothing that would even earn Oscar consideration, let alone a nomination.  The music scenes are confusing and has too many songs overlapping.  Here's a tip, start a song, continue that song, and finish the song.  Then move on to the next song.  I don't think this movie helped Chicago win Best Picture this year because Moulin Rouge is simply a bad film.  I haven't seen Chicago, but it has to be better than this junk.",1,3,7,5 April 2003
Million Dollar Baby," An excellent film
","I think everybody who criticized this film either have not seen it or take the controversy about the film out of context. Now that I have actually seen the film, I feel free to comment on the controversy.Spoiler: Unlike in the Terri Schiavo case, in which the patient's desires are debatable, here it is not. Maggie wishes to die because she is not able to walk or move her arms. As a professional fighter, it was the only thing she was good at. Do I agree with her decision? I think it was her decision to make. Whether or not I agree with it is irrelevant. I do understand why she made that decision. If you put her decision in the context of the movie, people who criticize her decision will at least understand why. It is also not easy for Clint Eastwood's character to fulfill her wishes. This does not glamorize euthanasia, but sees it as a very difficult decision to make.As for the movie itself, it is a great story of a boxer, her manager, and a guy who works at the gym. They basically become a family. Clint Eastwood is the father, Hilary Swank is the daughter, and Morgan Freeman is the uncle. Since these three are estranged from their own families, they create a family of their own with their home in a boxing gym. All three of the performances are great and the film takes you on a journey where you want to follow these characters. I contrast that with Closer, which had good performances, but I didn't care the least about the characters or their situations. In this movie, you care very much. It deserved every award it got. 10/10",10,7,9,30 March 2005
Shrek 2," Good, but first movie was better
","Shrek is a very funny movie and is fun to watch.  It has a lot of fun with its returning characters like Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey.  However, the story sort of repeats the first movie.  Fiona and Shrek have to realize how much they love each despite their looks, exactly like the first movie.  the new characters are not that interesting this time around.  Fiona's parents are not very interesting.  The Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming(played by the overrated Jennifer Saunders and Rupert Everett) are also quite dull. Antonio Bandaras Puss N Boots is funny though (Note to filmakers, jokes about cat hairballs can now be retired.  It wasn't funny in Cat In The Hat and it isn't funny in Shrek 2.)  The movie has plenty of humor to recommend it.  Just don't expect a classic like the first movie.",7,0,0,20 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Overrated
","I don't like Quentin Tarantino or his movies.  I think he is an egotistical, obnoxious jerk and his films reflect his personality.  Kill Bill Vol. l is no exception.  A few of the action scenes are good and Uma Thurman is excellent as the Bride, but the movie just doesn't work.  For one thing, I saw no need to split Kill Bill in half.  I think Vol.1 could have been cut by 15 minutes because of one pointless scene after another.  Do we need to know so much about Lucy Liu's character?  No and we don't care about her character.  Tarantino seems inspired by movies that only he has seen and rips off far superior Bruce Lee films.  I think everybody should give Quentin Tarantino a  message that Pulp Fiction was ten years ago and his 15 minutes of fame are over with.  Skip Kill Bill Vol.2 and no Vol. 3 for us. 5/10 and I am being generous.",5,0,1,14 April 2004
Big Fish," Terrific
","This movie brings a smile to your face.  Albert Finney is excellent as a tall talking old man who is trying to comes to terms with his son before he dies.  Ewan McGregor is also excellent as a young Finney who goes on extraordinary adventures.  We know where this movie is going and yet we enjoy the ride.  Will the son find evidence that some of what his father says is true?  What do you think?  I remember the late Gene Siskel used to say that fathers got a bad rap in movies.  They were cheating and nonexistant people for their sons.  Well, this movie is a coming together of fathers and sons.  With way too many cynical movies out there today, this is a welcome change.  I highly recommend this movie.  I give it an 8/10.",8,0,0,30 April 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Unintentionally funny
","The good news is that the Matrix Reloaded is better than The Matrix, which I think is one of the most overrated movies of all time.  The action is more exciting with better fight scenes than the first one.  The bad news is that the movie really suffers is people are talking and not fighting.  The dialouge and explanations as to what is going on is so bad, it's laughable. For example, Laurence Fishburne has to give a speach with every sentence beginning with 'I believe.'  I was ready to start singing 'I believe that children are our future...' from the song 'The Greatest Love Of All.'  I say go see X2 again.",5,0,0,16 May 2003
War of the Worlds," a mixed bag
","Of all blockbusters released this summer, this one is the weakest. This is surprising given that it is directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. He invented the blockbuster with Jaws and added to it with ET, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Jurassic Park movies. Recently, however, something has gone wrong. The Terminal and Minority Report were incredibly boring even with big stars in it. War of the Worlds is better than either of those past two movies. There are terrific special effects and John Williams's music is always good. The problem is we don't connect with the main characters. Tom Cruise is simply Tom Cruise and he is more tolerable than his recent interviews on TV in which he comes across as an arrogant jerk. His two children are another story altogether. The usually watchable Dakota Fanning just screams and yells a lot. His son is played by a bland pretty boy who is just annoying. When he disappears 3/4 of the way toward the film, we don't miss him. Tim Robbins steals every scene he is in and I would've liked the film to be more about him. A very disappointing 5/10",5,2,7,29 June 2005
Man on Fire," Good But Predictable
","This movie is very good, but very predictable.  The movie goes on far too long, about 2 and a half hours.  It also doesn't do much for the Mexican tourist industry.  Just about every cop in this movie is corrupt.  That said, I did enjoy this movie thanks to strong performances by Denzel Washingtion and Dakota Fanning.  Fanning is so appealing that you feel something when she gets kidnapped.  As always, Denzel Washington is excellent as Fanning's bodyguard determined to find everyone responsible for her kidnapping.  The movie does have plot twists that will only surprise people who have not seen a movie before.  However, there is enough good stuff in here to recommend the movie.  7/10",7,10,19,25 April 2004
Downfall," What an achievement
","Downfall is an extremely compelling movie. This is a realistic view of the last days of the Third Reich, set mostly in Hitler's bunker. When you are watching scenes in the bunker, you feel a sense of claustrophobia with the bombs coming down on Berlin. Bruno Ganz is excellent as Hitler. He sees Hitler in a delusional fanatic convinced that the war can still be won and he will personally lead them to victory. The fact that most of his troops are dead or captured and entire armies have been destroyed does not seem to faze him. Anyone who does not fight to the death is a traitor and a coward to him. If he goes down, he thinks the entire German people should go down with him. You see this in the movie with a scene of boys 12-14 years old manning artillery guns, blinded by their loyalty to him. The film does an excellent job in showing how even toward the end, many Germans were blindly loyal to Hitler. They do want to see Germany after the fall of the Third Reich. They would rather commit suicide and even kill their own children to spare them the fall of the Third Reich. See this compelling movie, even though it is in German.",10,0,1,8 September 2005
Hitch," Good but could have been shorter
","Hitch is a romantic and sweet movie. Will Smith and Eva Mendes have very good chemistry together. Kevin James is very funny as the awkward guy trying to date the very beautiful model. Smith is the 'date doctor' who is both trying to help James get the girl and work on his own love life. As much as I liked this movie,why do I score this movie only 6/10 instead of higher? Simple, this film, like too many films this year, goes on needlessly long. Was it really necessary for Hitch's profession to be a secret? Would a tabloid journalist really care about a professional 'date doctor?' No to both questions and because of these elements, the film nearly runs aground in this pointless subplot toward the end. Fortunately, the film has established enough good will so it can overcome these difficulties. It only needed tighter editing.",6,0,1,6 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," a great movie
","I'm one of those people who loved both Episodes I and II. Episode III backed me up with keeping the faith. For me, the series came to its logical conclusion and more importantly came full circle. This episode clearly shows how and why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. It also shows the circumstances surrounding the birth of Luke and Leia and why they were separated. We also saw how the Old Repubic became the Galatic Empire. This movie is the best of the prequels and has several great action scenes. There is a terrific space battle at the beginning. There is not just one great light saber battles but five. There are Anakin vs. Dount Dooku, Obi Wan vs. General Grievous, Mace Windu vs. the Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine, Yoda vs. the Emperor, and best of all Anakin vs. Obi Wan. What more can I say except see this movie as many times as you can.",10,1,7,19 May 2005
Ray," Great movie
","After seeing Ray, I felt like I met Ray Charles. This is an excellent biography of an influential singer/songwriter. Unlike Ali, which I think glosses over some of its subject's failings, Ray makes a three dimensional character out of Ray Charles Anderson. We see him as a great musical genius and as a guy who could be a real jerk, sometimes at the same time. Even though he was blind, he was a great business man who would not be taken advantage of. He was also a heroin addict and a womanizer which the movie goes into with great detail. Some of my favorite moments in the movie are about his younger days when he was starting to become blind and his mother had to stand back and make him figure his way around by himself. Jaimie Foxx is absolutely brilliant as Ray Charles and he and the picture deserve notice come Oscar time. 10/10",10,1,2,29 October 2004
Bruce Almighty," Great
","This is a very funny and very insightful movie.  I thought Jim Carey was very funny.  Jennifer Aniston is also very good as his girlfriend. However, it is Morgan Freeman who steals the show as God.  He manages to stand up to Carey and deliver funny moments of his own.  Yes the movie is  very predictable, but it delivers a smile to your face.  That is something that The Matrix Reloaded failed to do.",8,0,1,23 May 2003
Signs," Outstanding
",This is an outstanding movie.  It deals with the possibility that there may be people from other planets with great intelligence.  This movie deserves to be nominated for several Academy Awards and should win a few.,10,0,3,3 August 2002
X2: X-Men United," Surpasses the original
","This movie joins great company of The Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones, LOTR: The Two Towers, Toy Story 2 and Superman II as a sequel that surpasses the original.  This is a great movie.  It advances the characters established in the original and gives them a greater challenge.  It also has new characters such as Nightcrawler to advance the plot. The story is terrific and does not simply repeat the plot of the first movie.  The actors, especially Hugh Jackman, are in fine form.  I look forward to seeing X Men 3.",10,0,0,2 May 2003
Final Destination," Original
","This is an original horror film.  I like the interesting things it lays down about death.  I think the two lead characters are very good.  Yes some of it is a little goofy, but that is part of the fun.  So if you are looking for a roller coaster ride, this is it.  Beware, however, of the painfully bad sequel.",7,0,2,22 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Excellent
","Despite the 3 1/2 hour running (my only complaint), this is a great ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  This is the final battle between good and evil in Middle Earth.  I hope this is the year Lord of the Rings wins Best Picture and Peter Jackson gets Best Director at the Oscars.  I think this year's competition is weak.  If it doesn't win, it will be a travesty. All three films are a remarkable achievement and should be honored.  Honoring the last of the trilogy would be good.",10,1,1,17 December 2003
The Matrix," Overrated
","This has to be the most overrated movie in sci-fi history.  It is way too long and the acting is stiff, especially Keanu 'get me a new facial expression' Reeves.  Who cares about the special effects when the story is incoherent and uninteresting?  I certanly don't.  It disturbs me that many people consider this not only a great movie, but a classic!!!!  Did these people see the same movie I did.  I saw a dumb action movie with delusions of grandeur.  I say watch Star Wars again and see what real storytelling is all about.",3,8,18,16 May 2003
Fantastic Four," don't listen to the critics
","For the second week in a row, the critics got it wrong. First, they overpraised Steven Spielberg's been there-done that version of War of the Worlds and this week they trash The Fantastic Four. This movie is fun to watch and is far more enduring than Tom Cruise's slow moving flick. It is not as good as the first two Spiderman movies, Superman movies, X-Men movies, or Batman and Batman Begins. The guy who plays Mr. Fantastic comes across as exciting as your high school physics teacher. You know the class you took senior year in high school to impress colleges and put you to sleep every day. The other actors are pretty good such as Julian McMahon, Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, and the guy who plays the Human Torch. The other problem with the movie is that it takes too much time to get to Doctor Doom trying to conquer the world. Other than that, this movie is fun and I hope see more of The Fantastic Four. 7/10",7,6,13,8 July 2005
The Great Escape," wildly overrated
","I don't understand why so many people love this movie. There is nothing great about this escape. Since a majority of POWs who escaped were recaptured or killed, the title is misleading. I'm not saying every film should have a happy ending, but how about featuring the people who actually got away. If you think about it, escaping from a POW camp and getting recaptured at the end after following the details of the escape for nearly three hours is a bit of a cheat. This is one of those films that should have not been historically accurate. As reading previous reviews I have read, the movie was unrealistic as it was they might as well gone all the way with it. This mix of historical accuracy and Hollywood doesn't mix together very well. A disappointing 5/10",5,8,25,2 June 2005
Coach Carter," a terrific movie
","Coach Carter is one of the best movies of the year and one of the best movies I have seen. Samuel L. Jackson gives one of his best performances as the new head basketball coach at his high school alma mater. Carter makes his team do sprints, pass, and play as winners not just as individual players. Plus he makes the team keep at least a C+ average in school and that they attend classes. When they fail to keep that average, he cancels practices and some games until they keep their grades up. I personally like what Coach Carter teaches them. Basketball will not always be there for them. If they get an education, they can have a life after high school and even go on to college. Coach Carter makes his team winners both on and off the court. I wish there were more coaches like Coach Carter in both high school and college to prepare young people for life as adults.",8,3,3,21 June 2005
The Bourne Supremacy," Better than the original
","The Bourne Supremacy is an exciting thrill ride that manages to surpass the original in quality and entertainment value.  Jason Bourne has to come out of hiding to find out who is trying to kill him and why.  The CIA suspects Bourne of murdering two of their agents.  This is a great cat and mouse espionage thriller that ranks up there with From Russia With Love (sorry Goldfinger fans, but that was the best Connery Bond film).  Julia Stiles also returns as Nicki and has a little bit more to do this time, even though it is still a glorified cameo.  For the third Bourne movie, I would like to see Stiles with Matt Damon as possibly a love interest.  It would be a good change of pace for her who is known for teenage dramas and comedies to play more adult roles.  Matt Damon is excellent as Jason Bourne and I would like to see him again in this role.  Joan Allen is also good as the CIA boss obsessed with Bourne's capture.  This is edge of your seat movie, earning a 9/10.",9,2,2,25 July 2004
Shark Tale," Pretty fun
","I found this movie to be just fun. It is nowhere in the quality of Finding Nemo, Shrek, or Toy Story 2 but I found it a good time at the movies. Will Smith is very entertaining as the fish who tries to make himself into somebody by claiming to be a shark slayer. Robert De Niro is very good as the voice of the head shark. There are many in joke references to mobster movies and of course Jaws. I also liked Martin Scorsese as the opportunist blow fish who tries to use Smith's character to his advantage. The only one I was not impressed with was Jack Black as the shark who is a vegetarian. Maybe it is because I am not really a fan of his but his character is whiny and weak. This movie may not be appropriate for very young children because the sharks can be scary at times and the in joke references will go over their heads. 7/10",7,4,6,3 October 2004
The Island," better than I expected
","When I saw The Island was directed by Michael Bay, I was skeptical. He makes a lot of exciting action movies but when something is not blowing up, his movies get stale. Bad Boys II was particularly annoying and did anybody really care who got the girl in Pearl Harbor. Well, The Island pleasantly surprised me. In the future, Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanson live in a state of the art city where everybody awaits a chance to go to the island. I don't think I am giving anything away (since it is given away in the previews) that they are in fact clones of real people who just use the clones to increase their lifespan. After the two discover the truth, they escape. There are a lot of well made car chases and a great action sequence on top of a building. Yes the story is a mix of THX-1138, The 6th Day, Logan's Run, and Michael Bay action movies, but I went around for the ride. It may not be a great movie (it borrows too much from what came before) but it is a fun movie to watch. It is also better scifi than Steven Spielberg's overrated War of The Worlds remake.",7,5,8,24 July 2005
