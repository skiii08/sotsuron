Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just what I expected... A Star Wars film
","With all the publicity and hype surrounding this movie, it made it difficult to watch with an open mind.  However, I tried to leave my prior knowledge at the door and watch this movie for what it was:  a Star Wars movie.  That's all it was.  Nothing more, nothing less.  All the elements of the trilogy were to be found in this movie:  Jedi lightsaber battles, spaceship combat, the droids, the Force, it was all there.  People who expect more than this will probably be disappointed, but others, like me, who came to see a Star Wars movie in the mode of the trilogy, will enjoy the movie for what it is.",7,0,0,21 May 1999
