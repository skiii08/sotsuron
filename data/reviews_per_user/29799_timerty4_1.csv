The Avengers," Unclear Plot, Lame Jokes, Inaccurate Character Potray
","From the name of this movie, we are supposed to feel that this movie has to represent Marvel superhero characters. So this movie has a responsibility to make each superhero look as genuine as possible but it is not mostly successful.The movie is entertaining in many moments. I like Iron Man's suit removal scene, seeing Black Widow's confidence when she was being interrogated and her subsequent self-release, the fighting between Thor, Iron Man and Captain America when Loki was taken to the helicarrier.What do I dislike about the portray of the characters? Black Widow in her normally very cold or cool appearance appears too surprised and fearful when she was in India while pointing the gun to Bruce, even though she already has backup. If she is really a trained agent, she should have prepared herself for the possibility of Bruce getting angry. But she reacted as though she was unprepared for that, this conflicts her status as a trained agent. If she was prepared, she would have shown it more, and concentrated more on evasive actions rather than felt so surprised and fearful.The movie has quite bad immature jokes.The movies has many poorly-constructed jokes that seem immature. It mentioned adoption and bullying to crack jokes, and the worst of all, it uses the dying Agent Coulson to make people laugh. It has quite a poor and unhealthy sense of humor. It made me think whether this movie is only for young and immature teenagers to enjoy. It could have an unhealthy influence on growing up kids.This is the movie's most confusing subplot-- The movie's plot has Loki and Hawkeye trying to prevent the Avengers from stopping their plan. Hawkeye was to destroy one of the helicarrier's engines, why he didn't destroy the other engines is a mystery, maybe he did not have enough ammunition? Loki comes aboard the helicarrier to create his own mental disruption.Black Widow in her interrogation deduced that Loki was trying to influence Bane somehow so that he will turn into the Hulk before he could locate the Tesseract. We can then see the scepter glowing with blue light when the avengers were arguing and Bane feeling agitated. Maybe Loki was influencing Bane to pick it up too. But not many people could understand this part of the movie plot properly if they don't already realize that Loki's scepter could influence minds. This should have been hinted on when Hawkeye suggested the plan to Loki.The joke when the police chose to listen to Captain America was also another lame comedic moment.Hawkeye's arrows should have more explosive power in the city, and he should have been aiming the big targets rather than the small ones, such as the head and eyes of the giant whales. He seem weak in the movie. He turned into a swinging spiderman at the end before looking like a poor casualty because he could not properly break his entrance, which contradicts his character as a trained agent. I think Hawkeye fans would be more displeased with the portrayal of the character.Black Widow should have a second round with Loki at the Stark Tower with the mind games since they both like to play with each others minds. But Iron man took her place to show Loki that his scepter could not work on him. It seems like another lame comedy moment.Hulk was simply smashing everything. Nothing much. Captain America and Iron Man were their usual selves.Thor was cool and not letting his character down. But his hammer should have punched a hole in the containment glass rather than leave a crack. Loki was a great villain, which was also obvious from the first Thor movie. He could win MTV's villain award this year.Nick Fury looks too agitated at times. Bruce should be more like that.There are indeed many exciting and entertaining parts in the movie, but nothing too much to brag about when it comes to the portrayal of some of the superheroes. This movie makes some superheros look good but others look lousy. The intention to make some of the superheros look fallible seems to end up making them look inaccurately portrayed.My judging for the movie: Because of the lame jokes I will minus 1 point. I will minus another 1 point for Black Widow losing her cool in one scene. I will minus another 1 point for the confusing subplot involving Loki in the helicarrier. I will minus another 1 point for making Hawkeye not aim for the big targets and making him look like a bad victimized casualty after his ambitious spiderman-like crashing swing into a building.Therefore I give this movie a rating of 6.",6,7,18,29 May 2012
