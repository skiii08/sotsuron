Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What can I say? I was blown away
","Well, I bought the movie ticket expecting to be impressed. I was MORE than impressed. I have so much more respect for the other Star Wars films. Lucas did a terrific job with keeping the film 'made 4 SW-fans'. Superb acting! Liam Neeson and Ewan McGreggor were so cool and Natalie Portman deserves some kind of award. Jara Jar was brilliantly funny and I take my hat off to Jake (aka Anakin). No faults (yes I voted a 10-excellent) ... except I thought it was too short! I swear I was only in my seat for half an hour.... and they should've had more of Mace Windu (Sam L. Jackson). Forget Austin Powers! GO SEE EPISODE 1. I'm going to see it again and again until it's off the circuit or on video! Oh and BUY THE SOUNDTRACK! ~ Luv ~",10,5,7,15 July 1999
