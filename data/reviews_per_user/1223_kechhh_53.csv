Requiem for a Dream," Great Downward Spiral
","If there was a genre for depressing movie called Depressing, this would be the star movie in that category.This movie told a very involving, ugly, and depressing story about the downward spirals of a few individuals. It showed the smashed dreams of the four and the disastrous downturn in their lives. In fact, this movie made me feel depressed for them for a bit.The anti-drug message in this film was definitely strong and the intoxication through cinematography was great especially with the monster refrigerator.The soundtrack was also appropriate, as the sad dreary piano tone still makes me think of this movie to this day.",Null,0,1,20 March 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Not Bad
","Pretty good and exciting movie. Seeing this in this days date, it seems like a pretty typical action movie. I suppose it was innovative for its time, though.The acting was great and the settings were also pretty awesome.My favorite thing about this movie was the clever trap type maze sequence at the beginning. It seemed so clever and I wish there was more of it in the later parts of the movie.Another great thing was the music. The now well known Indiana Jones theme is very melodic and sounds great.Would watch this movie at least once. While not ground breaking in today's date, it is still good to watch.",Null,1,3,9 April 2013
Casablanca," Casaok
","The acting was great. But honestly, I felt that was about it. I don't know why this film is up there. Perhaps it is a classic, but just because something is classic and used to be popular is good doesn't mean it is good in the current day. By current day standards, the plot is sub-par.Sure, the plot is alright, but compared to the plots of modern films, it isn't great. Of course it made a major contribution to films of the time and to history, but it doesn't mean that it is a good movie to watch for entertainment now.Storyline was decent and writing was pretty good, but not really interesting.Acceptable, to watch for historical value, but I wouldn't show this movie to someone who wants entertainment.",Null,2,5,26 March 2013
Se7en," Great Twisted Movie
","There was tension throughout the entire movie and in significant doses and the mood was set just right. Great acting, too. The juxtaposition of personalities and life philosophies between Freeman and Pitt were great with Freeman showing a jaded, wise, and cynical character and Pitt showing a more rash dreamer.Most significantly, I feel the tone and underlying themes were incredible. An insane killer turns out to be incredibly smart and manipulative and ironically the most rational one (in his twisted way) in the end, while Pitt allows himself to be manipulated into becoming Wrath.I feel Spacey was great and logical in his twisted way. I feel he pretty much had the cunning and wit of Joker (Dark Knight) and the twisted modus operandi and philosophy of the killers in the Saw series.At first, I felt the pacing in the beginning and sudden thrust into the action was too fast, but by the end, I felt that this was a good move, as it helped keep a swift and ugly pace and tension.The ending was also ingenious. Clever on the part of the writer, I feel it wraps up nicely.Finally, I will definitely remember the last lines of the movie: Ernest Hemingway once wrote, ''The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' I agree with the second part.'",Null,5,7,24 March 2013
Fight Club," Fun Club
","I was one of the ones who luckily didn't know about the twist until I actually watched the movie. Because of that, it was pretty mind blowing and great once I found out. After that point in the movie, the tension kept on building up.While the underlying themes and messages gave meaning to the movie, I found the 'reject everything' type lifestyle to be a bit corny and slightly too much.The narration and movie storyline was great and acting was pretty good. One of the issues I had, though, was that after finding out about the twist, some of the scenes in the movie made a bit less sense and I would think the people around him would at least mention something about it.Overall a decent exciting movie.",Null,0,0,18 March 2013
Memento," Greatmento
","Though this movie felt slow to some, I felt it was paced perfectly. From the telling of his past through flashbacks and explanation of his condition, information was conveyed well and cleverly.Also well done was the sequence of alternating scenes. I felt this was truly genius, as it gave some sense to what otherwise could have been a convoluted mess.I felt the tone, feeling, loss, and sorrow in the movie were portrayed well and you could really get a feel of his emotions.Lastly, I felt the twist at the end where we find out his wife survived and he actually killed her with insulin was great and made sense. The overarching theme of rather living a meaningful lie than a sad truth rings true to many people - it is the choice of a happy lie instead of a sad truth. The Matrix explored this a bit, but I felt Memento gave a much more stark, realistic, and sad telling of this in where a man chooses a lie instead of the truth.",Null,1,2,19 March 2013
This Is the End," Pretty Funny
","The acting was great. The plot wasn't too exciting, but the comedy was awesome.I especially found the Emma part and the 'doing X everywhere' part hilarious. Also funny was the part during and following the possession - pretty funny.The plot wasn't too exciting and pretty predictable, but the comedy was awesome. I'm just glad they didn't do a cop out at the end where it turns out the whole thing was a dream.I especially liked the heaven sequence. The guest band was definitely a surprise and was funny.",Null,2,8,20 July 2013
12 Angry Men," Waste
","I really don't think this movie should be on the top 250, let alone the top 20.The acting was alright, but as for the plot, there wasn't anything incredible or mind blowing enough to warrant a basically one setting movie.The entire movie revolving around the one scene and circumstance got incredibly repetitive and boring. It seemed simply to me like just a short jury drama with nothing much else to add to it.Even at the end, after the jury switches its opinion completely, there was nothing great. To me, it was just an average boring argument between several people about a minor crime without even later solving the main crime itself.Perhaps this movie was good back then. Right now, it is 2013. And right now, if it was released, it would barely make a dent at the box office. I judge on this movie's entertainment value in the present, and in the present, it does not entertain me.",Null,2,27,18 March 2013
Terminator Salvation," Not Good
","Not very good in my opinion.Connor lacked any good characterization in this - I just didn't care about him in here. Didn't care about the half human half robot guy either - I actually don't even remember his name and I only watched this a few weeks ago.The plot was completely predictable and unexciting. I could tell what was going to happen basically from the beginning.And at least the others were semi-believable in its action. Connor breaking into a super secure futuristic robot facility? I don't think so.Any attempts at a universal overarching robot-human-spirit theme also failed.Finally, any attempt at nostalgia and comedy through Arnold failed. This movie did not belong in the series and it tainted the real trilogy.",Null,5,8,20 July 2013
The Prestige," The Great Trick
","I thought this movie was great. Although originally, I thought the story sounded dull, the writer was able to make this movie flow well and maintain my interest.The twist of the duplicating machine and the twin brother took me completely by surprise, though I know I should have seen it coming. The suspense and depth to the movie helped keep me intrigued and thinking about it after the movie.The one issue I had with the movie was the teleportation/duplication device. Up until then, the movie, seemed pretty realistic. Despite this, I feel the magic device helped really spice things up and I don't think it would have been the same without it. Perhaps it was a double-edged sword.Overall his descent into anger and jealousy and loss of his woman helped make the movie much more intense.",Null,0,0,19 March 2013
The Terminator," Not Bad
","I think this movie wasn't bad. Though the effects might be cheesy for the current day, I feel that these must have been ground breaking for its time.I don't think the story was as complicated or interesting as it could have been, as it seemed like a simple flee type action movie.The premise, though, was interesting. Especially good, I feel, was the making of the father of John Connor to be the time traveler and the picture in the end becoming the picture which was earlier on in the movie. These plot devices were clever and decent.Other than that, the action was decent, but could have used some improvement.",Null,1,3,12 June 2013
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Not Bad
",I actually thought it was funny in some parts - I usually don't for old movies.I thought it tackled the theme and feel of a doomsday scenario pretty well - likely better than many serious movies have tried to or could have.The acting was decent and the music was not bad.It would have been nice to also see the Russian side of things from their view to let everyone see all sides to it.The only issue I had was that the Dr. Strangelove acting I didn't really find funny. I also found him a bit too exaggerated. Also didn't really see why the whole movie was named after him.,Null,0,1,20 July 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Pretty Good
","A pretty good action movie. The move from racing based to action based movie was definitely the right direction for this franchise to take.Some of the stunts were a bit too unbelievable, but I suppose I should let them go because it is pretty much what everyone expected. There were no mind blowing plot twists or overly intricate story lines which I feel could have made the movie better.Just a plain good action movie, with buff and likable characters. The post-credits scene was also pretty nice, as it ties this film into Tokyo drift nicely and more logically than that one film did.Overall, a good mindless action movie with good lines and fun characters.",Null,0,1,12 June 2013
Life of Pi," Could Have Been Great
","I thought the storytelling and narrative were great. I loved how things were told in the past tense. The acting was also great.One part, obviously, which stood out completely was the CG effects. This movie was beautiful, and everything looked incredible. The waves, the water, the colors, the animals, the scenes, looked stunning.Despite these great parts, the movie fell short of the great potential it could have had. Though touting that the movie would make you believe in god, I found nothing in it doing so. While he did touch upon the idea of 'choosing what we want to believe', I feel the idea was undeveloped. He could have developed a strong overarching universal message about life or choice, but he failed to pull through. The movie definitely set the stage and enabled him to do so if he really tried. Despite this, there really was no clear universal or moral message - it was way too ambiguous. For this reason, while this movie was good, it could have been even greater.",Null,2,4,11 April 2013
Forrest Gump," The Best in All of Us
","A great comedy and a great and touching drama. I felt this movie achieved a perfect balance of comedy and drama and depth. A balance that pure drama and pure comedies often fail to achieve. To me, this film was more touching than movies that were intended to be mainly touching turned out to be. In that, Forrest Gump was a masterpiece.You see the small things he does and the greatness he inspires and causes in people all around him without having much intelligence. This helps remind us that no matter what kind of person we are, no matter what physical or mental capabilities we have, we still can cause so much greatness in people's lives both intentionally and in ways that we don't even know.The movie is also inspiration in that you see a picked on persevere and either not notice or completely ignore the ridicule and setbacks he faces. He takes it and he runs as hard as he can.His plain and complete niceness reminds us that it doesn't take much to be nice and cause positive change in other people's lives.Also, the bus scene setups were great, enabling the great flashback style and narration storytelling that made it great. It was finally great to see in the end someone who actually stayed to care and listen and skip their bus.Great movie. One of my favorite.",Null,1,1,19 March 2013
The Godfather: Part II," Godbetter
","Definitely enjoyed this Godfather more than the first one, as I thought the parallel stories helped add a bit of variation to the movie. I thought the format was great and the pacing throughout the movie helped keep interest.While the beginning of Vito's story was great, I felt his rise to power occurred too quickly and the assassination of his father's killer was done too easily and without any shown planning.Michael's story was done well, but I felt the sudden jump to the Senate hearing was rushed and unexplained.If these flaws were corrected, I feel it could have been a much greater movie.",Null,0,3,18 March 2013
Léon: The Professional," The Semi-Professional
","I found this movie to move rather annoyingly slow. Probably the first 75% I found to be a bit boring.In addition to this, the bit of sexual tension between Mathilda and Leon was a bit weird and felt forced.The sense of revenge was dulled too, as it felt like to me Mathilda didn't play enough of an essential role in it. Perhaps I would have liked her to become an assassin herself, but I suppose this would have been too Hollywood and corny to be believable.The only saving grace I felt was the last perhaps 20 minutes and her final planting of the tree. The last 20 minutes were exciting and touching, partially making up for what I felt was the many flaws in the movie.The acting be Leon was great, though.",Null,1,5,19 March 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fellowship of Fellows
","While I did like this film, the pacing was a bit slow for me. The acting and scenery was great, but I feel like the film was too much of a setup for the next few films.Somehow, this was my least favorite of the trilogy. I feel that even the last battle in this one was not exciting or epic at all.If you take this as a standalone movie, I wouldn't have given it such a high rating. This felt to me to be mainly a setup to the other films. I didn't feel much tension throughout this movie, so I was getting a bit tired of it by the end.Perhaps if I ready the books I would have liked this one more.",Null,0,1,18 March 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I Liked It
","Perhaps there is something wrong with me, but I think this one was the best one of the series.I liked the music in here. In addition, the effects were some of the best of the series.Also, this was the one of the only movies in the Terminator series in which the ending didn't go as predicted.I liked the semi-surprise ending and the sense of finality this episode brought. It finished the series and brought it to a full circle.Lastly, I think this was Arnold's funniest movie as a Terminator.The series should have stopped here, but I'll leave that for another review.",Null,2,3,20 July 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator 2
","I love the theme song of the terminator.I feel the ending sequence was particularly interesting when he lowered himself into the lava. While the overall plot wasn't bad and was pretty interesting, I actually liked the later films more.Arnold was pretty funny and I loved a lot of his lines.The action was great and seems like it was pretty good for its time.The bad guy in the film seemed pretty invincible and it was great that he seemed so powerful compared to Arnold. This made it seem like it was a definite uphill battle for the whole movie.The liquid nitrogen part was clever and I wish they incorporated it into the movie a bit sooner and used it as a tool for his downfall.",Null,0,2,3 July 2013
Apocalypse Now," War
","I think this movie did a decent portrayal of the ugliness of war. Not only did it show the brutality of it, but it also showed how unseriously and irreverently some of the combatants took it, especially the American soldiers. Especially good was the showing of the blatant disregard of life of the Vietnamese - lives that the American soldiers seemed to deem worthless or at the very least of much lower value.The narration was good and done well in a noir-commentary type style.The only issue I had was of the ending. I don't feel Brando in reality would have let himself be killed so easily after establishing such an empire and army. This part was a bit unbelievable.Other than this, a pretty good movie.",Null,0,2,12 June 2013
American History X," History
","I thought this film was alright. While the acting was good, I don't feel like enough of the story was explored, leaving much to be desired.His time in prison and protection by his black friend wasn't really detailed. They neither showed his black friend directly defending him or even having a direct influence on his safety. This detracted from the movie and should have been detailed a bit more completely.In addition, I don't feel like such a drastic change in attitude and behavior could have occurred from merely the events that happened in this film. Racism is deeply ingrained and I feel much bigger things would have been required for views to change - something which wasn't explored.Finally, I feel one of the reasons this movie gained so much acclaim was the surprised ending death of his brother. Also, something which was neither fully explored nor explained.",Null,2,7,19 March 2013
The Usual Suspects," Suspect its Pretty Good
","Plot and acting I thought were great, but I feel the accent by the first suspect that died was a bit exaggerated and difficult to understand.While I did know about the existence of a twist, I was caught off guard by the double twist, so I was a bit happy about the surprise.Despite this, I feel the premise of the movie was a bit off and merely used as a setup to the climax of the film. What kind of person would work so hard to make a convoluted plan to use convicts to help him kill a boat full of people just so people wouldn't know who he was. And then in the end he is so careless as to let one live and also end up making it so his identity is revealed to even more people.Despite this, the devil line quote was memorable and also the dialogue in the rest of the movie. Overall a good movie.",Null,2,3,18 March 2013
Saving Private Ryan," War
","The beginning scene at the grave is well done in that it doesn't give away whose grave it is nor who the old man is.The D-Day battle was grotesque, horrible, chaotic, and raw - a great portrayal of how ugly war can get and how horrible this particular invasion was. I felt this scene was one of the best war scenes I've ever seen in a film and just for that I feel this movie deserves acclaim.The hopelessness and evil of war was well done, but I felt that things slowed drastically after the initial battle scene. The rest of the movie moved a bit slow for me, and the ending was not the great for me. The beginning scene, though, is what saved the film.",Null,1,2,19 March 2013
City of God," City of Gritty
","Normally, I don't enjoy movies based on true stories, but this one is an exception.The gritty, dark, dirty, and violent depiction of the favelas was great and I really got a good feel of the slums.The intro sequence, I feel, should have been left out, as it helped give me the solace and knowledge that the main character was alive and free from death throughout the whole movie.Characterization and acting were great and it really showed how dark and evil it can get in these areas.Also, what I thought was great was the ending where they show a new rise of youngsters ready to step up into the world of crime, thus indicating the existing cycle of violence which was to continue.",Null,2,4,18 March 2013
Django Unchained," Pretty Good
","Pretty good movie and interesting portrayal of extreme racism. I thought it was definitely helpful to have a turncoat type character such as the one Samuel Jackson played.The action scenes were intense, gory, and crazy.I do believe one way the film could have been improved is if he had additional motive for revenge. While it does seem to be a revenge film, the main brunt of revenge seemed to be more fitting for the three brothers killed earlier on. I think it would have worked better if the final enemies were the three brothers. The final revenge being on no-names and on Samuel Jackson, while action packed, didn't seem to be satisfactory as a revenge on the three brothers would have been.Even if the final revenge was on Leonardo, I still feel the three brothers would have made a more inspiring tale of vengeance. In addition to this, I felt a better Rocky style training montage would have not only pumped you up more, but also give you a more logical and realistic sense of his desire for revenge and training to become better. His slave to supreme gunslinger ascension was realism breaking.Overall, a good movie which could have been even better.",Null,1,3,12 June 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Awesome Towers
","I thought this movie was great. I loved the sense of tension, hopelessness, and buildup at the Helms Deep battle. It really made you feel like all was lost. And finally, at the end when backup arrives, you feel a sense of relief. The simultaneous occurrence of this and the trees helping at the other battle really gave a good climax.Acting and scenery were great and the pacing of the movie was great. One issue, I had, though, was that the size and power of the help which finally arrived at Helms Deep didn't seem that grand. They should have better emphasized or shown greater numbers to show the overwhelming great win which occurred.I liked this one way more than the first one and it was my favorite of the three. I don't know why this is the least popular one by everyone.",Null,0,1,18 March 2013
Schindler's List," Ugly but Great
","This movie was ugly and grotesque, in other words, perfect for what the film was trying to achieve.The movie depicted vividly and well the dehumanization of the Jews at the hands of Nazis during World War 2. The ugly scenes, massacres, and killings helped at least give you a feel of the terror and fear these people must have felt at the time.Usually, I don't find movies based on true events to be as interesting, but this was an exception. The final scenes where they show the real life Schindler Jews visiting his grave was touching and helps solidify the realities of what happened.One issue I had was the movie being in black in white - I felt it was unnecessary and the same feelings could have been achieved with a color movie. Related to this, I felt the red dress girl was overkill and also unnecessary. Finally, the final scene of him crying didn't seem to be that realistic - perhaps a bit overdone to me.Other than those issues, I felt the movie was great and done well.",Null,28,47,18 March 2013
The Hurt Locker," Hurt Locker
","Pretty good and exciting movie. Definitely had tension throughout. Despite this, the main character's rebellious attitude was definitely something I feel would have been called out for in the army, especially in such life and death situations.I feel the tensions between the civilians and the army were done well and there was an obvious aura of dislike towards the military presence. Scenery was done well and I feel that the story moved at a good pace.In the end, I especially liked the juxtaposition of normal U.S. life versus the harsh reality and dangers in Iraq and in war. It gave a good feel and reminder to how dangerous it is there.",Null,0,1,28 March 2013
The Dark Knight," Good batman
","A very clever and mostly action packed movie.The acting was great and I felt the movie pretty much kept you on your toes at all times. I loved the twists throughout the movie, as there wasn't one single large twist, but many trickeries set up throughout the entire thing.In addition, it felt like there was a bit of depth to the movie with its quotes, views on evil, and moral dilemmas. Thus, not only was it a good action, but it also make you think - something I've found to be less common in action movies.The ending was a perfect setup to the next movie and kept you thinking about the movie and what would be in store next for Batman",Null,0,4,18 March 2013
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Good Movie About a Bad Relationship
","The premise of this movie was novel and clever and the performances by both the main characters were good. The use of her dyed hair as both a symbol and a time marker were great, as they added depth to the movie.The music and emotion in the movie were both great. When Carrey finally realizes he doesn't want his memories to be erased is the beginning of the great part of the movie. Knowing all his memories are going to be erased helps add a nice touch and finally his acceptance gives good closure.I felt that the ending was bittersweet, as I have been in a horrible relationship before. Though knowing their entrance into what would play out to be a horrible relationship, they still enter it anyways, giving a sense of truth to the movie - I feel a couple in the same circumstances would do it again if their memories were erased.The ending memory sequence of them in the house as it begins falling apart is definitely my favorite scene from the movie.",Null,0,1,20 March 2013
Life Is Beautiful," Life is Beautiful
","A touching movie.The first half of the movie definitely had some funny parts and was cleverly written. Also, the acting was funny and fitting for the main character.The second half of the movie gave an interesting different take on the holocaust. While not adequately showing the grotesqueness of the camps, I believe it did an innovative and touching way of showing how bad situations were and how far a man was willing to go to protect his son from knowing the horrific situation he is in.This part wasn't really that believable, but it was still touching. The end was fitting, as it was bittersweet instead of a a completely happy ending. In the end, it is shown that life is a gift and truly beautiful.",Null,1,1,30 March 2013
Pulp Fiction," Pulp
","An intertwined set of stories.The acting was great in this movie and the scenes and situations unique and exciting. While there was no main driving plot, I felt that the dialogue was very well written and performed great. I don't know why I feel like some of the lines are so memorable, but they just are.In addition, I thought some parts were very funny, helped add to how memorable the movie was.The scenes also not being in complete chronological order helped shape how well the movie turned out. Lastly, I felt the movie maintained the right amount of tension throughout.",Null,0,2,18 March 2013
The Godfather: Part III," Godbest
","This one was actually my favorite, and I don't know why the other two are rated so highly while this one was hated.While the daughter's acting could have been better, I feel it was sufficient for it to get things across.This one was my favorite, as I felt that it portrayed Michael's tragic downfall incredibly. Here, you also see that nothing went according to plan, as in the end he was even unable to get his son to take over his business. Finally, when he decides to give up the title of Don, his daughter is killed.I believe the most beautiful yet sad part of the movie was the ending sequence where it flashes all the women he lost in his life and shows him dying alone with his dog. A fitting end of a life a crime. Sad, but a perfect ending to the trilogy.",Null,0,1,18 March 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," Decent
","While I didn't particularly like the main character, I do like the theme that the movie was trying to push that basically 'It's a Wonderful Life'. I do like it when movies explore how important life is. Despite this, I feel that this movie could have done it more completely and thoroughly. While I don't know exactly how, I think more could have been added.I didn't like the temper of the main character. I feel the movie could have benefit if the main character was a bit more likable. I found him to be easily angered and temperamental. While I do see they were trying to draw a contrast to him from before the angel and after, I think that if they made him more likable throughout the movie, you would have felt more sympathy and happiness for him in the end.",Null,2,5,5 April 2013
The Departed," The Deparbest
","I thought this film was great. The acting was good of course and the music was good.Usually I'm not super into mob/mafia/crime dramas, but I thought this one was excellent. The double-mole scenario gave an incredible amount of constant tension throughout the entire movie. In addition, it kept things complicated and complex, something that I often personally find to be nonexistent in most crime dramas.The ending was also well done and took me by surprise. There was no hint or indication the main character wouldn't survive the movie and it happened in an instant, which I felt was great and broke out of the cliché.",Null,0,0,19 March 2013

","This movie wasn't bad. Interesting plot and continued suspense, though it has definitely shown its age - and not just in technology. The amount of horror and suspense is limited, compared to films of the current day.The plot twist, if you could call it that, was transparent and I definitely saw it coming. I don't know if this is due to having seen so many movies already or due to exposure to modern cinema, but I was not surprised at the ending.One other surprise, which I suppose might have been revolutionary for its time was the killing of what you thought was the main protagonist in the middle of the movie.Overall, not bad, but I wasn't particularly thrilled at it either.",Null,0,1,12 June 2013

","I thought the acting and development was great in this movie. Especially great was the nurse - I really began to dislike her throughout the movie and her condescending acting was great.While confined to pretty much a singular area, I feel the plot, though simple, was good enough to keep me entertained, but not completely satisfied.The twist at the end was a shocker and happened quickly. I think this was done well, but could have been explained slightly better, as it isn't completely clear that a lobotomy took place. The ending was good, but connecting to all the characters except the Indian was difficult.",Null,1,4,18 March 2013
The Lion King," Best Children's Movie
","This movie was and is my favorite Disney movie. A timeless classic.The best part about this movie, I feel, was the musical score. Circle of Life, Hakuna, and Can You Feel, are great songs - so melodic and memorable that I remember the tunes and lyrics to this date.Overall, I felt this was a story about what we all often do: Running away from problems. But in the end, also as we should do, Simba turns around to face them. This inspires me still, and most definitely inspired me when I was a child.The reunification scene with the baboon was one of the most hilarious scenes I've seen in a children's movie while at the same time being deep and about facing your problems and not running away from the past.Finally, I believe the themes of facing your problems and the unification of all life are universal deep themes that are told perfectly well in this movie.",Null,0,0,20 March 2013
Inception," Inbestion
","This movie was perfect to me. Probably my favorite movie of all time.While not completely superficial, the universal themes and underlying messages weren't too deep. I suppose it could have been better if the themes were more developed and had more universality to it, but let us not forget that films exist to entertain. Art, acting, action, scenery, camera angles, and everything else, I feel, exist mainly to help tell the story and come secondary to the entertainment factor of a movie. I feel that movies exist primarily to entertain, and this movie entertained me well.I was on the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie and the details and circumstances were designed and explained perfectly - not too detailed and convoluted, but enough to understand what was going on.Acting was great and pacing was great.",Null,1,5,18 March 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," Redemption
","Great narration by Freeman, as always.I felt they set the mood and pace in the prison very well. I think the acting by Robbins could have been a bit more emotional or clear, as sometimes he seemed a bit dull. Acting by Freeman was great and his final release from prison held emotion.Also touching was the final letter from the old guy who got released from prison. I believe his suicide speech was one of the best parts of the film and Freeman's explanation of it very deep.I feel like the one thing the movie was missing was a dramatic vengeance on his wife's killer. It is the one thing that could have truly caused full completion. Even if this added another hour to the movie, I believe this would have been worth it.",Null,0,0,18 March 2013
The Silence of the Lambs," Not Bad
","Decent horror/thriller movie. I felt the use of an insane criminal to find another criminal was a clever plot device. I think there could have been more twists and turns overall in the movie with this, though.Of course, Hannibal's acting was great and one of the great things about the movie. The characterization of the main character was a bit lacking, and though it was touched upon a few times, it was never fully developed, and thus didn't live up to its true potential by showing her inner strife and history.Finally, the ending was perfect, as one criminal was caught and the other free. This was a proper ending for Hannibal and I felt there would have been no other good way to tie up the endings of the movie.",Null,1,2,28 March 2013

","I thought this movie was pretty good. Action packed and with a lot of good acting and scenes.I did take issue with the film on many levels, though. While the previous movie seemed to have more depth and underlying messages in it, this one seemed to be a bit more superficial. Don't get me wrong, I do believe the main purpose of a movie is to entertain, but I felt like something was missing without the kind of message present in the last one.Also, while I do like it in movies where characters must work hard and train to overcome their problems, I feel like the sequence where he escapes the prison could have been done better. It would have been nicer if he was in there longer and it showed him training harder and learning new things as opposed to just regaining his strength.Finally, the final disposal of Bane seemed to be too fast and insignificant - it could have been done better. The main villain of the final movie of the trilogy should have had a more epic final scene.",Null,1,5,19 March 2013
Toy Story 3," Not as Good
","I thought this movie was alright. The comedy, storyline, and whatnot were decent. I still don't think this deserves a higher rating than the first Toy Story.One thing memorable about this movie was the bad guy. He definitely was developed well and made me actually be scared and fear him too along with the other toys.I think this was an adequate and proper conclusion to the Toy Story series. A tale about growing up and passing things down to the new generation. It was a bittersweet end which was proper as it would have been not believable at all if the toys stayed with the kid. I really hope they don't make a Toy Story 4, though, as it would seem to be just dragging it out.",Null,1,4,20 March 2013
Rear Window," Decent
","Pretty good for the time period which this movie was from. Most movies from this time period bore me, as I always find that they don't have enough drama, suspense, or action in them. But this movie, I liked.To be honest, during the whole movie I thought that the main character was just looking too deeply into things. I thought he was over analyzing and that Thorwald was innocent. It was therefore a surprise for me at the end when I found out he wasn't.I think Hitchcock did a good job of showing no completely clear signs of guilt to keep the viewer guessing the whole movie. If anything, perhaps it was too far in the other direction in that it convinced me the main character was thinking too hard.Overall, a good movie for the period its from for me.",Null,0,1,5 April 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Return
","While I thought this movie was great, I feel it wasn't as good as Two Towers. The rallying of the ghosts was exciting, but the battle was short lived and seemed like a cop out. It could have been done much better with more excitement instead of the ghosts just killing everything easily.The acting, as in the previous films was great. Despite this, I feel that the ending before the ring was thrown in the fire could have been done better. The final confrontation was a let down and not exciting at all.The long conclusion was fitting for such a lengthy trilogy and a great end to the movie. I feel some movies skimp on the ending, but I feel Return of the King did an awesome job wrapping things up. I thought the comedic effect of the dwarf was unnecessary and interrupted the serious and dire feel of the movie.In conclusion, I feel this was a great movie with some flaws.",Null,0,1,18 March 2013
The Matrix," Good
","I thought this movie was good, but not great. The feeling of being in the matrix and not in imminent physical danger kind of made me feel like they were a bit more safe. The development, introduction, and explanation of the circumstances were great, especially the scene where Morpheus explains everything in his chair under the dark cloudy sky.I also liked the speech by Smith where he equates humanity to viruses. Acting, action, and pacing were great. The famous scene with all the guns where he invades the building was epic and crazy.Usually, I dislike it when there are unfinished endings like in this Matrix, but I suppose it was necessary to set things up for the next movie. This one was probably my second favorite of the series.",Null,0,1,18 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Decent
","The acting and settings and premise of the film was good. Pacing was good.This film was probably my least favorite of the latter three Star Wars films, though.Some things didn't make sense to me, like Obi submitting so easily and Luke not even bothering to use his visor for that final shot. It just didn't make logical sense and the lack of human psychological reality detracted a bit from the movie for me.I feel that this film was a good setup for the other two, but I feel that that was all it was. An introduction to the characters, background, and lore.A bit more action and character development could have helped, though I did enjoy some of the subtle comedy in the movie.",Null,0,0,18 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Empire Strikes Well
","I thought this movie was great, especially the opening battle on Hoth. Acting was great as expected and pace throughout the movie was excellent.Overall, the movie seemed dark and ominous. The revelation about Vader wasn't a surprise, as it is hard to avoid the 'I am your father' lines after being alive for more than a few years. This probably would have been more exciting if I didn't know. Despite this, it was still good.Special effects were decent, considering the age of this film, and if released today, I would still be accepting of the visuals.The ending was a good setup for the next film. Though this was a good film, I still liked Return of the Jedi more.",Null,0,0,18 March 2013
Gladiator," Decentadiator
","I thought this movie was good, but not great. To be honest, I watched this a while ago and I don't remember much, meaning it didn't really stand out to me in particular.The only memorable thing to me was the final battle and definitely the music. The 'Now We Are Free' song I can still definitely remember. Probably one of my favorite songs in movies, rivaling the Gattaca theme.Other than this, I thought there was a lot of cliché and corniness, especially his final battle and death at the end and the woman's cheesy speech. I did like his after death scene where he sees his wife, though and the final lines of his Gladiator friend, where he says 'Now we are free. I will see you again. But not yet.' Or something like that.",Null,0,2,20 March 2013
Back to the Future," Back to 1985
","Hilarious, clever, and fun. Definitely a good classic. Doesn't take itself too seriously, but still provides some action and tension in the movie.I thought acting was great and that though a little too eccentric, the doctor was probably the right acting for the role.The plot was clever, not overly complicated, and didn't get bogged down in any stupid time paradox details.It was nothing crazy, but I still thought it was entertaining. The cliffhanger at the ending was fun, as it implied a continuing adventure in time travel.",Null,3,4,19 March 2013
Goodfellas," Mediocrefellas
","I honestly wasn't that entertained by the movie. Didn't really end up caring too much about the characters either.The acting was good, but I still didn't really feel for them too much. The pacing and set were alright.I don't know how close to reality the movie portrayed these events, but I really feel like there should have been some additional action or twists to help spice up the mix. I honestly don't care how true movies are, as I watch them for entertainment value.Overall, though, I felt the movie was a decent watch, but it wasn't one that I would watch again or buy the collector's edition of.",Null,1,5,18 March 2013
The Godfather," Godacceptable
","While I feel the movie wasn't bad, I also feel like the movie has been given much more praise than it should have gotten.Well, perhaps this movie was glorious in the 1970s, I am rating it from 2013, and feel like if this movie was released now, it wouldn't have gotten as much attention. For 2013, this movie was mediocre to me.While the acting from Al Pacino was great, I feel Marlon Brando's acting was a bit too much with his soft slurred voicing of Vito Corleone. It came off a bit weird to me. If anyone spoke like that in real life to you, you would probably think something is wrong with that person.The first half of the movie was incredibly slow and boring to me.The restaurant scene was definitely good and leaving the Italian dialogue untranslated added a nice touch. The rest of the movie was just decent to me. The ending felt a bit too easy - to me it seemed like it was all done so easy, making it feel like it could have been done better.Overall, I think this movie was good, but not great.",Null,2,6,18 March 2013
