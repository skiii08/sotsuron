First Man," Many beautiful moments, but Gosling ultimately downs this mission.
","There's a lot about this film that I appreciate, the recreations, the cinematography that matches the old footage, most of the performances and the first person perspectives of the various missions and disasters.That said, what was the deal with Ryan Gosling's performance here? I can recall one instance in the film when he managed a smile, the rest of the time he has a look of perpetual seriousness on his face.His portrayal of one of greatest men who ever lived is that of a constant sad sack, a man who looks so forever depressed that he doesn't seem to care about what's happening around him, I know he does, but he doesn't look it.I'm not really sure what happened during the production phase that makes the filmmakers believe that Neil Armstrong was so deadly passive that he'd rather be elsewhere than at the helm of a spacecraft.The rest of the film, though, golden and very well done.",Null,0,1,11 December 2019
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Once upon a time, Freddy Krueger was scary.
","It's amazing, but no matter how many times I see it, the original still grips me. What's important to do when you watch the original is to forget everything you know about Freddy.Forget the endless sequels, forget the series, forget the fame, forget his face, forget his name, forget about Robert Englund, all of it, and return to that moment in 1984 when you knew nothing, not who he was, what he was or what he wanted. If you can do that than you'll be amazed at how fresh, new and scary Freddy's first appearance was!He's no laughing matter in the original, no one liners, no jokes, just a mysterious phantom who's intentions were frightening and that's the Freddy I love, when his image, the image intended by Craven, wasn't tainted by celebrity and over exposure.",Null,1,1,5 October 2019
