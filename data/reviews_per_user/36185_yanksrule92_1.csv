Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat Brings Out Worst of America for our 'Make Benefit'
","An unprepared viewer of 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' would interpret the movie as offensive, vulgar, and insulting to our country. But, if you look at it another way, it is a gift for our country. By acting uncivilized, antisemitic, ignorant, and rude, Borat proves to his American audience the flaws in U.S. society. It is not Borat, a Jew himself, who is to be laughed at but the unbelievably uncivilized citizens of the United States. Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. Preceding our mid-term elections, Cohen has exposed our country, so that we can make educated votes on November 7th. It is a shock to see first-hand the antisemitism and atrocities of this country. Because of Borat's documentary, Americans have seen what we did not expect to see in our first-world United States. But we can fix it. 'Borat' is an absolutely hilarious film, but it is also an important warning. Therefore, we must tell our friends to see it and enjoy it so that America can rise above its flaws and become a better country.",10,2,16,4 November 2006
