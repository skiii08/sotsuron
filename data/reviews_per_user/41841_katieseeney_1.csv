The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Brilliant film
","Absolutely brilliant. Such a lovely film. Found myself smiling through a lot of the movie. It has sad times and happy times, but to sum it up it gives you a feel good feeling while watching it as a lot of people may associate themselves by situations that the main character has gone through. It helps you to see that even though your going through such a tough time you can still have friends and be really happy. This film was a bit of a realization of my own life and gives me the belief that things can get better. Definitely recommend to lots of audiences but specifically to those who want a movie that's inspirational/emotional/mind blowing.",8,0,2,9 May 2016
