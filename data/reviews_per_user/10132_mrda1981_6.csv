The Avengers," Super-b!
","The much-hyped superhero ensemble project finally sees manifestation on the big screen: the wait has been worth it.Ensemble projects like this always carry the risk of being bloated, or ruined by overkill; thankfully, Joss Whedon sees fit to not only give each of his superpowered protagonists ample screen time, but also effective characterisations, too. Hell, even Hawkeye and Black Widow--two characters who were treated as mere appendages in previous Marvel flicks--have a strong presence here. Tom Hiddleston, makes a mischievous antagonist, playing Loki as a megalomaniacal Jack the Lad with a potty mouth (never thought I'd hear the term 'mewling quim' in a mainstream, all-ages flick); but the strongest standout, for me, has to be Mark Ruffalo's ever-on-edge performance as that big green wrecking machine, the Hulk.Action-wise, there's no disappointment, with each set-piece giving our heroes an excuse to show off their pet powers. If the ensemble panning shot during the climactic battle doesn't win some sort of award for camera-work and direction, I'll be very surprised! The real mastery comes from the entwining of characterisation and conflict, with the course of the latter very much informed by (and informing) the former.In short, this is a must-see as a supe move, a summer blockbuster, and an all-round great piece of action cinema.",9,1,4,6 May 2012
Twilight," 90210 with the Prozac pumped out of its stomach.
","Hades and Persephone sanitized and sterilized for the Twitter generation. The slow, almost somnambulist motion and the washed-out filters contribute to making this extended music video treatment fascinatingly lifeless. I'm sure this was an intentional cinematic reflection of Bella's obsession with the undead object of her affection; but, in my case, it kept me anticipating a change of pace never to arrive, even during the fight scenes between rival vamps. Whilst not quite as awful as its detractors declare it, it left me wondering what its t(w)eenybopper fans get so darned EXCITED about (not that trying to understand the t(w)eenybopper mind is a fruitful endeavor at the best of times).When all's said and done, Twilight isn't a vampire movie--it's a ZOMBIE flick!",5,1,5,25 May 2012
Django Unchained," Spaghetti Southern
","Tarantino takes an old spaghetti western franchise and reworks it into the context of the Antebellum-era American South. This time, the protagonist is a freed slave, out to take back his love and enact a bloody revenge on those who shackled and savaged the pair of them. Jamie Foxx puts in a more-than-serviceable performance as the intense, hard-bitten Django, but he finds himself somewhat overshadowed by Christopher Waltz as his smart-tongued, soft-hearted, bounty-hunting liberator and compadre, Dr King Schultz. Samuel L. Jackson puts in a hilarious and horrifying turn as the servile-yet-sharp house slave Stephen, serving as formidable backup for Leo Di Caprio at his bastardly best as plantation-owner Calvin Candie.Despite the close-to-three-hour running time, Tarantino avoids burdening the film with the tangential self-indulgence that marred his previous outing, Inglourious Basterds. Instead, we get a decent blend of characterisation, cameos, comedy, and carnage which come together to form a memorable slab of spaghetti southern blaxploitation. Some of Tarantino's soundtrack choices prove kinda jarring (Hip-hop...in this setting!?), and he could do with proofreading his historical accuracy at certain points, but overall, I think he got more right than wrong with this one. Give it a shot, or six.",8,1,4,21 January 2013
Drive," A friend described this as 'Shane in a Michael Mann skin' and I'm inclined to agree.
","Powered by a superficially tranquil energy, this Western-on-wheels story has much bubbling beneath its sleek, taciturn outer layers, much like its nameless protagonist. The long, subdued stretches that characterise the narrative serve to make the sparse scenes of action and romance all the more savage, stirring, and memorable when they arrive. Although the detached, resolute anti-hero speaks sparsely and softly, a lot is conveyed of him through his barely spoken affection and regard for his lone mum neighbour and the ruthless, brutal lengths he pursues to keep her from the claws of the mobsters he finds himself entangled with. As such, this film works not only as a gritty crime drama and atypically touching love story but also as an engaging character study which relies on the aforementioned elements to reveal the protagonist's (and, to a lesser extent, the support cast's) multiple layers. Is he, as the excellent synth soundtrack suggests, a 'real hero', a troubled and tortured bloke hanging by a thread, or some semi-integrated blend of both? At once haunting, arresting, and poignant, Drive is the cinematic equivalent of the very best synthpop: cool, celestial craftsmanship punctuated by harsh, pounding beats, both belying the raw, organic heart pulsing at its core.",8,2,3,21 January 2013
The Mist," In short, potent viewing.
","I really got a kick out of this one! Based on a novel by Stephen King, and filtered through the lens of the director of the Walking Dead, this feature sticks the spotlight on a group of townsfolk holed-up in a supermarket to avoid the extradimensional invaders outside. Despite the b-movie premise, this film is elevated by some memorable, enthusiastic performances (check out Marcia Gay Harden as Bible-thumping Mrs Carmody), and an excellent psychological edge which sets the townsfolk against each other. Indeed, the herd mentality and fanaticism of the townsfolk poses just as existential a threat to our protagonists as the creatures intent on eviscerating them (so much so, I hoped the invaders made chili con carne out of most of them).Oh, yes...after two tense hours, the movie has a conclusion that kicks you in the teeth---twice!",8,2,5,25 May 2012
X-Men: First Class," a.k.a Magneto: The Movie.
","Under the direction and writing of the bloke 'n' bird who brought Kick-Ass to the big screen, the ever-enjoyable X-Men franchise gets a cinematic reboot. Like a more accomplished version of the Star Wars prequels, FS depicts the origin of the mythos' primary antagonist and his agenda of mutant separatism/supremacy. The success of the whole thing rests not only on the shoulders of Mr Vaughn and Mrs Goldman, but also those of the well-chosen cast. Standouts include Nick Hoult's clever-yet-conflicted take on Beast; January Jones playing Emma Frost with an air of detached ennui; Kevin Bacon in bastardly form as Sebastian Shaw; and James MacAvoy's roguishly idealistic Professor X. There's even an amusing precision F-bomb of a cameo from a staple member of the franchise.Star of the show, however, has to be Michael Fassbender's steely-yet-sympathetic take on the Master of Magnetism. With a singleminded charisma he effectively takes 'n' makes the movie his own, conveying a full range of states, 'between sorrow and serenity'. Indeed, I found myself rooting for him over the clear-cut heroes of the piece. Even his glaring awkwardness in the final scene, whilst dressed in Magneto's trademark threads, can't diminish all that leads up to it. Also, he gets the most memorable background score in the whole film.Is First Class a top-tier comic book adaptation? Sure. More significantly, though, it's the first of a new subgenre within that subgenre--the supervillain flick! Enjoy...",8,1,2,2 May 2012
