The Lobster," Random, dark story that changes its tone halfway through
","'The Lobster' is quite a unique experience. It's a story about a man in the near future in a hotel that's designed to help single people find a mate, or be turned into an animal if one fails to do so. It's a tale of loneliness, love, and transformation. The deadpan nature of the actors and environment mixed with the grim, silly humor makes me feel like this film would be the result if the boys from Monty Python tried making a serious movie. The characters are mostly apathetic, as it seems those in charge in the future wants everybody to lack emotion, which sort of adds to the hilarity. It's a weird movie, but I enjoyed it. Although I feel like I would've enjoyed it more while drunk. It starts off well and rather funny, but it gets more serious as it goes on, and sort of loses its charm a bit. A film such as this that starts off dark and humorous but loses its humor towards the end, just becomes dark and depressing. However it is still an enjoyable flick, worth seeing.What really got me laughing, were the absurd attempts by the establishment to stress that being part of a couple is better than being single. No spoilers here, but in particular as an example, is what the dart-shooting instructor says to the man from room 187, as he calls him up to take his turn. This is just one example of many. The comedy is emotionless, blunt, bleak, and seems to mirror the lives of those in reality who struggle to find a partner.There are obvious social commentaries in the film, driving home messages of loneliness, relationships (especially ones that are forced, either from within oneself, or by an outside force), and government's forcefulness and knack for butting in where it's not wanted. You can take it more seriously like this, pretend that the film has a point. Or you can just go along for the random, ridiculous ride.
Just be prepared for it to be a different movie at the end than how it starts.If you liked this (or you haven't seen it yet but have enjoyed some of the following), I will recommend a few films/tv shows. There's a movie that is even more random than this one called 'Rubber,' about a killer telekinetic tire. Hilarious, and quite misunderstood. There's also 'Black Mirror,' an excellent show on the nature of society and technology, 'The Lobster' seems to me to be a similar in terms of social criticism in the future. Then there's 'In Bruges,' a hidden gem also starring Colin Farrell. There is also 'Withnail & I,' 'Equilibrium,' 'Harold & Maude,' and 'Barton Fink.'",7,1,4,19 December 2018
It," Disturbing, dark, depressing even, and downright delightful
","'It.' A story about kids in Derry who must band together to fight an other-worldly terror that preys on children and others in the small town of Maine. A haunting thrill throughout, with scares and laughter and even traumatic moments, this film is evidence horror is still very much alive today, and that the idea of sequels and remakes must not be dismissed. Overall, the film is a knockout. The makers of 'It' evidently put thought and heart into the remake of the 90's classic made-for-TV hit and a great mix of what is in the original book by Stephen King and what the filmmakers decided would be original ideas to bring the story effectively to the big screen. There is so much that makes the movie worth it. It captures the essence of King's novel by bringing back some memorable elements, such as lines, characters, atmosphere, and the very fear that the children experience. And like the novel, there is humor throughout, to remind the audience that despite what the children go through, and despite the mature decisions they must make, they are still just children, alone in their conflicts from the adult world. It follows the book just enough to satisfy any fan of Stephen King (unlike some films *coughcoughDARKTOWERcough*), and even impress the man himself. Aside from similarities to the book and maybe even the 90's film, the film stands on its own, so people unfamiliar with King's work and the original film can easily understand and enjoy it, while a King fan will be delighted to see Pennywise in a new light, and enjoy classic moments (beep beep Richie!!). There are some elements that are disagreeable, but not many and they still can't bring my perfect score down. First of all, too much CGI. It seems to be used as a cop-out in films these days, a crutch. However, for the most part it is well used and effective. There are jumps scenes, something that many feel is a cheap scare. Chances are fairly good those people would still be caught off guard by some of them in this movie. Some may find parts cheesy, some may find the whole thing cheesy, so while the CGI and scares may be a problem for some, many will find them quite enjoyable. The scares truly are different, and terrifying.There also doesn't seem to be near enough character development, and it feels like you don't get to know each of the children enough, save maybe Bill and Bev only. But this is evidence of filmmakers pandering to the needs of the ever-changing audience, as modern general viewers sometimes get bored of the legendary Hitchcock-ian pace. The film moves very rapidly from the start and keeps the flow going throughout the film. Sometimes it feels like the characters don't even get much of a break in the last half of the film, but that's what happens when you try to fit a cinderblock-thick novel into two movies. You do however get to know the kids enough to get by, and it doesn't impede the progress of the plot.The acting even is favorable. Sometimes wooden, most of the time genuine. There are times when you truly feel what the children are feeling, and occasionally cause a stir of emotions. And let's not leave out Pennywise. We all know how difficult it would be to fill Tim Curry's clown shoes. But fear not, this new dancing clown is no circus. Demented and frightening, he will toy with the children's minds, and leave symbolic bite marks on viewers' souls. I have a personal beef with those reviewers who say it's nothing like the book and nothing like the works of Stephen King. These people are posers and have obviously never read 'It' or any of King's novels, so take their reviews with a grain of salt. This story is an adult horror from a child's perspective. Fears from our childhood was a major influence on King's work, and 'It' was its epitome. A must-see, but not for everybody, especially the feint of heart. It is a dark, evil, twisted fall down the rabbit's hole, and this rabbit has teeth. LOTS of teeth.",10,11,23,8 September 2017
Hereditary," Artfully unnerving, borderline scarring
","First of all, if anybody is accusing Hereditary of not being like The Exorcist, KNOCK IT OFF. You can't compare modern horror to a horror, let alone a CLASSIC horror, that was made over 40 years ago. This is a different era for the horror genre, with a completely different audience. And so, while there are a few minor similarities, Hereditary stands alone in its entirety. It's not like The Exorcist, and it never was intended to be. And that's a good thing. But if anybody should be comparing films, I feel the film that most feels like Hereditary is 'The Babadook,' despite its many and obvious differences. It's also just as enjoyable. Hereditary is about a family coping with a loss, an estranged grandmother with a mysterious background. They struggle to trust one another, and it seems from the start the relationships between them are damaged. There are trust issues, alongside paranoia. On top of it all, the mother starts to uncover a dreadful truth about their deceased matriarch. Things get creepy, and dark, and genuinely scary. There are rave reviews out there, as well as negative, but the rating speaks for itself. How rare to find a modern horror to have above a 6.5 on IMDB, so obviously without having to see it, you should know the film is doing something right. And it is indeed. The whole of it is unnerving. The atmosphere is chilling, much to the help of the score and excellent performances of all the actors. The flow and directing, on top of cinematography all play an effective part in the story, and is unique in its own way. I especially love the plot device of the miniatures, and how the family's home from outside can be debated as real or a model, which invokes doubt of what is real and what is not.Unfortunately, while I give this film high praise, I cannot love it. The director's goal was to 'upset audiences on a very deep level.' He not only succeeded in this, but he may have been too effective. This is NOT a 'fun' movie. It will be disturbing to many, ESPECIALLY the religious. And do not bring children to it, unless you want a visit from child protective services. On a personal note, it has been many years since I've been tempted to leave the theater during a film, and never before has it been a film that I was currently enjoying. And such it was with me for this film. I found myself emotionally attached, and those emotions were being ripped apart in such a way that I was becoming a tad upset, which hasn't happened in a long time. I was enjoying it, yet at the same time, loathing what it was doing. But everybody's different. Can't say many will share a similar experience. So I still recommend it, highly. But be warned, it gets crazy.",9,5,9,10 June 2018
A Star Is Born," It's good, but a bit pretentious and unrealistic
","Here is an emotional tale about a well established, and internally troubled musician who falls instantly in love with a talented woman, and takes her under his wing. What stands out the most are the performances by both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, both of whom work together like Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell. And despite the story being about two people in a professional position the vast majority of hopefuls could only dream of, their relationships and struggles are relatable, and captivating. And while I'm not a fan of Gaga's usual musical style, I personally found myself really enjoying the music. And wow, you'd think Cooper and Gaga have been lovers since before both their careers even began.But there is NO WAY Gaga's character would have had that vocal range and stage presentation that early. Lady Gaga is a heavily practiced and trained performer, and her character was someone who was just used to small audiences in a familiar setting. To suddenly start performing at the level of Gaga herself from the get-go, is a little ridiculous. The story is a bit cliche and predictable, and Cooper was definitely coming off a bit 'rapey' at the beginning. If he wasn't such a stud, more people probably would have been put off by his character early on (I mean imagine during the scenes at the club, where he first meets her, replacing Bradley Cooper with Michael Emerson or Andy Serkis. SERIOUS creepy vibes). It also seemed as if they wrote the film with the intention of making it into the Oscars (a modern age problem, an Oscar award should be just that: an award. Not the main goal).Still, I was hesitant on watching it in the first place (honestly, only reasons I ended up willingly watching it, was because I love Bradley Cooper, and I used it in an act of compromise with my wife to get her to watch a horror movie with me), and I'm glad I did. Good movie, worth checking out.",7,1,3,28 February 2019
Hot Fuzz," 10 reasons to absolutely LOVE this film.......
","1. Originality/cleverness (Not many movies are similar to this. The movie is full of unique and one-of-a-kind humor.) 2. Jam packed with great laughs (Really, if you don't laugh throughout this movie, you were either in a bad mood to begin with, or maybe you're just not an exciting person.) 3. Plot: A super talented police-man officer (lol, get it?) gets thrown from the front line of action in the city to the country, to serve in a peaceful and perfect town, where crimes are unheard of. As he befriends others, he starts to learn that this town holds more than meets the eye.... (Well thought up, perfectly executed. Also one-of-a-kind, you can't argue with that. Character development starts with a bang in the beginning and does well the rest of the film) 4. Action/amazing special effects 5. Different each time you watch it (I've seen it 7 times now, each time I notice something different that makes the movie even better. Most of them are little, like phrases used in the beginning, then used again later on in different context.) 6. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are amazing (if you liked Shaun of the Dead, you should thoroughly love this!) 7. Old people with guns (One thing people look for in a movie, is the unexpected.) 8. Fast paced, moves along very well. (From the beginning, you're thrown into the great story and will have you watching intently the rest of the film.) 9. Unpredictable (Sure you might be psychic and predict a few things, but you'll never predict the whole movie unless your friends ruin it for you. It's got surprising twists and turns throughout with clever dialogue and such) 10. Will have you cheering! (I saw this film twice in two different locations, and both times the whole audience was vocal, in the non-annoying way. We laughed, we were trans-fixed, and we cheered more than once.) Basically, If you love comedy and kick arse action, there is no reason for you not to see and enjoy this movie.",10,2,4,16 January 2009
American Sniper," Powerful and thrilling, hits the mark
","American Sniper is a film based on the true events that surrounded Chris Kyle, a heavily skilled and determined American SEAL, and his brothers-in-arms in the Middle East during a time of war and crisis. It's a story about a boy who grew up to be a man and yearning to fulfill one specific duty: To protect men, women and children from those who seek to do evil and harm.The movie takes us through a bit of his early life and training, and then juggles between his 4 tours in Iraq and his life on US soil as he struggled with internal and external dilemmas. It's an accurate portrayal of the life of Chris Kyle, and his confirmed 160 kills that saved many innocent lives. The film is not perfect, but aside the minor editing flaws, fake babies, and a few sub-par directing decisions, it's a movie well worth seeing for the action, the drama, the laughs (there were some good ones), the cries, the story, the characters, and the patriotic tribute to the men and women who serve. I would also like to mention the respect given to Chris Kyle and his family is well executed in the film, and I've never seen a theater packed with people so silent as they filed out as the end credits rolled, silent save a few sniffles. There's a lot of controversy regarding the actions and beliefs of Chris Kyle. Do not let this mindless squabble tell you who Chris Kyle was, go and see the movie yourself and learn of the sacrifices he and ALL troops made to keep the US (and others) safe. This isn't a story about a blood-thirsty killer, this is a story about a man who was committed to his God and his country, and who ended blood- thirsty killers. You can do some protecting for yourself and others in the theater, just bring some tissues to protect those around you against running makeup and wet cheeks. God bless our troops.",10,76,159,16 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Another breathtaking addition to the Hobbit saga!
","There was quite a build-up for this movie, and also for the dragon Smaug. And Peter Jackson did NOT disappoint. The movie is everything any Lord of the Rings and Hobbit fans could ever want. More adventure, more action, more everything, only with the coolest dragon to ever hit the big screen. Or any screen. The tale of Bilbo Baggins continues as he ventures with his Dwarven companions to reclaim what was once theirs. There is plenty in this movie to satisfy anyone, even those who aren't die-hard Tolkien fans. Director Peter Jackson asked us to put faith in him, especially since he tends to go astray from the events in the book, but I must say that the faith his fans put in him has definitely paid off. The story is intriguing for all, and at the end will have you BURNING for more!!",10,11,25,13 December 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Fantastic....But overrated, and not one of Tarantino's best
","It's a fantastic throwback to the golden age of Hollywood, and 60's filmmaking. They did a PHENOMENAL job setting the atmosphere for 60's movie sets and the lives of a few fictional and non-fictional 60's movie stars, and used some excellent cinematography and story-telling tactics.So why was I disappointed? I think it's because Tarantino set such a high standard for himself, he's made it nearly impossible to surpass his pre-existing work. So far, nothing's been able to top 'Inglourious Basterds' imo. Some films have come quite close, but in his world, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood falls quite a bit short.It's still an entertaining and worth-while cinematic achievement. No point in beating around the bush for this one; either you're gonna love it, or you're gonna like it.",8,0,9,5 January 2020
Aladdin," Really disappointed Genie didn't call Aladdin a 'fresh prince'
","Aladdin is yet another cash grab; an exhaustive remake of a perfectly good animated Disney classic. An attempt to pander to both loyal Disney fans and potential new ones, Disney tries to bring Aladdin to life with CGI, a new look, and new faces. Of course, NOBODY could do Genie like the late and beloved Robin Williams, and it would be rather dull if Disney did a mirror remake of the original, so naturally doing things differently would be inevitable and sensible, and that's what they did, only they put little effort and creativity into it.Jam packed with enough messages about morals and modern politics to make even Sean Penn feel awkward, this preachy remake is mostly pomp and circumstance, having the costume design, some of the CGI, and a few of the jokes, really the only good points about the movie. The rest is mostly corny moments ('you can do it!'), confusing plot elements, extremely lame original music pieces, and otherwise lame attempts to be original while keeping the classic story intact. While Will Smith did a better job in the role of The Genie, one cannot shake the feeling that there were others out there who would have done much better. And of course, the writers are also partly to blame. But Smith did certainly shone brighter than the rest of the cast, who apparently were told to act like they're in a high school play.It would be unfair to completely condemn the movie, as it's obvious why many people would enjoy it. It might be right up their alley with their style of comedy, and I may be a tad biased because so far none of the live-action remakes of the childhood quintessential Disney flicks lives up to their standards. And yes, they WILL be compared to the classics, so don't act like they're supposed to 'stand on their own' and such.All in all, it's yet another disappointment from Disney, who has the talent to do better, but they would rather try to appease as may people in a generic, paper-cutter, almost 'bureaucratic' sort of way. The Lion King is our last hope....",4,37,66,1 June 2019
The Lion King," Unnecessary
","The CGI remake of arguably Disney's most popular movie of all time was a bullseye in animation, and a floppy miss in everything else. Disney wanted to create a 'realistic' adaptation of the original 1994 film, so they spend a whopping sum on the CGI effects, as well as the cast. When comparing to the original (because that is inevitable), the original is like a large fruitbowl of a wide selection of fruits in all sorts of striking colors and shapes, whereas this remake is a plain rice cake. With few very (and one specific) exceptions, the voice talent was atrocious, with Zazu and the hyenas being the utmost worst. It seemed like most of the actors were just reading straight from the script for the first time. The voices in the original were all unique and brimming with character, but many voices in this 2019 version were simply bland and forgettable.The script and dialogue felt like it couldn't make up its mind whether to stick to the original script or go in a new direction, making the flow feel rushed and confusing. The musical performances felt like neighboring countries had filed noise complaints against the characters, and Scar's 'song' was just pathetic (for the record, in the original performance of 'Be Prepared,' the hyenas' march wasn't a rendition of a Nazi formation; it's a MILITARY march, to give the mass of hyenas the feel of an oppressive army, NOT a direct reference to the Nazi regime specifically). Almost every single joke added in, that wasn't in the 1994 movie, fell as flat as Zazu at the end of the original's version of 'I Can't Wait to be King.' Our theater was silent through most jokes. And with this version being more 'realistic,' emotion and character expression was completely nonexistent.All in all, even if you're a huge fan of the original (who isn't?), this should be a hard pass.Originally wanted to give it a lower score, but a 4 is more deserving because the animation was incredible, and there were a couple good moments that differed from the original story (LOVED Timon & Pumbaa singing 'The Lion Sleeps'). Additionally, it's good Beyonce didn't have as prominent a role, but that's just personal opinion.",3,10,15,24 July 2019
Midsommar," Style AND Substance
","Who would have thought a movie with such a bright and aesthetically pleasing exterior could be so disturbing and alien inside? Midsommar is such a film. It's remarkable; like viewing a documentary on a culture from a different planet. The horror sets in quick, taking no pause. Along with the main characters, the viewers then take a strange plunge into the sunny depths of a ritualistic hell. There, relationships are tested, drugs are induced, and all that should be light and wholesome are revealed as dark and horrifying, especially to those unfamiliar to the customs of this 'village.' It's an unsettling ride, effective and well done on everyone's part, and I'm sure many will not be able to look at a beautiful bouquet of flowers the same way ever again.",9,11,20,11 January 2020
Elysium," What every Sci-Fi Action flick needs to be like!
","Elysium is an energetic science fiction action thriller featuring Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley. Neil Blomkamp certainly aims to please, especially fans of District 9, as both the movies share many similar elements. A crock-pot full action and violence, and spiced with a few humorous moments, we follow our hero as he struggles to live within the future L.A. slums that are packed to the brim with the poor and unfortunate. You can almost hear the monotone chant; 'bring out your dead' over and over again. Meanwhile, up in the confines of space, the rich and fortunate live in utter bliss on the rotating space station, Elysium, free from the disarray of Earth life. The story rages on, heavy with themes of justice and equality for all, as our hero stumbles upon something that could change the course of history, and bring the two worlds back together again, and save those who really need it. Matt Damon's character is believable enough, with Jodie Foster coming in as a ruthless commander and politician of Elysium. Both do a good job, but the real winner here is Sharlto Copley, who emerges as a completely new type of character than that in District 9, one who is eccentric, dangerous, and malicious. Along with a fun array of new weapons, robots, and fun ways to be blown up, Sharlto Copley adds that special touch of uniqueness that elevates the level of fun. It would be unfair to also give praise to the special effects of the film, which looks marvelous on a big screen. The cinematography is well done, adding a few new filming methods, and improving on old techniques to help elevate the feel of the movie. One could question the racial undertones that define the living standards of each way of life, and one could also nit-pick the realism of this future world, and Wolverine-ish superpowers of Matt Damon. However, the movie does share a moral of what a beautiful planet Earth truly is, and gives us a good lesson in gratitude. While it panders to the action and sci-fi junkie, it also allows room for just about anybody to envelope its positive themes and appreciate the courage and strength of the characters. However, it's main purpose, is to entertain, and blow you away. And this movie does just that.",9,22,53,9 August 2013
It Chapter Two," Pennywise isn't freakin' kidding.
","It: Chapter 2 was almost everything I wanted it to be. Almost.The sequel feels like a direct continuation of the first part, only slightly amped up with more scares and intensity. There were some let-downs however, so I'll start with those:-Yes, it's long, but it didn't really feel like it until they started wrapping things up at the end.
-There was also too much use of CGI, albeit there being some really awesome, scenes with it (like, for example, a brilliant reference to a certain John Carpenter classic... 'Trick r' Treat' anyone?).
-More scares indeed, but some felt either too forced or predictable.
-There was a bit too much profanity, which isn't something I'd normally criticize, but much of it felt too unnecessary.
-As far as I could tell, there weren't any, or as many, 'subtle scares' as the first one.Aside from these nit-picks, the movie does not disappoint. It dives more into the emotional attachment the characters have to each other, and to It. Unlike the classic 90's version, it also explains more of It's origins. Not only does it follow the first part well, it also uses plot elements and themes in the book, and twists it into something new. So it's so much like the book, yet, it's not, and in a satisfying manner. And while a few scares may be a tad flat, it's still quite intense. And yet, like the first part as well, manages to maintain a balance of horror and comedy. It's more brutal than the first, and just about as fun. It was relieving to find the way they ended it all in the movie was handled VERY well, considering how strange and cerebral it was in the book (don't look into the light!!!).And if you heard, or read, any rumors about it possibly being the 'bloodiest film of all time,' don't get your hopes up. It does have its moments, but it's nowhere near 'Evil Dead' or 'Dead Alive.' Or even 'A Nightmare on Elm Street.''It' started well, and ended well. Fans of the first should walk away happy as a clown....after an appetizing dish of child.",9,15,23,6 September 2019
Jaws," The Epitome of Suspense
","No movie can beat the brilliance of 'Jaws' within the world of suspense and horror. Some movies have come close, others have even matched it and gone on as legends themselves. But none have, or ever will, surpass this Spielberg masterpiece.Everything about this movie is flawless. It's most famous for its editing and direction. There is nothing to nit-pick. Just go see it, and I will withhold judgement if for some reason you dislike it in any way. For those who are big fans of Jaws, and have not yet seen the movie that launched Spielberg's career, go watch it, it's called 'Duel.'",10,4,5,14 October 2017
Annihilation," A cerebral and visually striking thriller
","In order to enjoy this movie, you must enjoy/appreciate movies that do not explain everything, and that leaves the audience to ponder what the heck they just saw. You must also like sci-fi, thrillers, and have at least a small taste for horror. Those who enjoy this movie possibly also enjoyed (or would enjoy) movies like Gone Girl, 10 Cloverfield Lane, Jurassic Park, Arrival, The Thing, Sphere, Interstellar, Prometheus, and of course, Ex Machina. Annihilation is a film based off a novel by Jeff VanderMeer. It's about a woman searching for answers when her husband mysteriously reappears after going missing during a classified military operation. A biologist, she enters with a small team of women into a world created on our own by what appears to be a fallen meteoroid. This world defies logical biology in quite fascinating, and horrifying ways. So many questions need answering, such as: What is it? What is it doing? What are the effects on the environment? On humans? And while some questions are answered, others appear to be unanswered, or at least, answered cryptically. Admittingly, I myself am still confused about a few plot points of the film, but it's exciting to think about it and discuss with others.It is quite bizarre, and the cinematography is quite stunning and beautiful. Acting is nothing special, nor is it bland. The basic ingredients for an effective and entertaining film are met here, with no major complaints. It's quite different, those worried about predictability shouldn't be worried. It can get intense. Those who say it's 'boring' must be impossible to please. Personally, I've seen so many horror movies I have thought I was too desensitized to be 'scared' anymore, but I found myself absentmindedly tearing apart my lower lip in trepidation by the events on screen. Sure it may have some slower parts, but let's be honest, what movie DOESN'T have slow parts? In these scenes, situations are discussed, discoveries are made, mysteries are explained, and tension is prepped. There really are no dull moments, and the movie keeps you wondering throughout. It's a fun, exhilarating film. I imagine most who see it would walk away satisfied, but if you hated every movie above that I compared it to, you should probably skip this one. Which is a shame. Because it's awesome.",9,5,9,18 March 2018
