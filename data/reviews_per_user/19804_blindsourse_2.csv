The Ring," the most scary I've seen
","I've seen my fare share of scary movies, and I'd have to say, this is the best. Its very scary, but deep as well. I came with many more questions that I wanted answered. After thinking about it, most of the questions were answered. My friends and I had some great discussions about the plot.I was very impressed by the cinimetography and the editing, I'd say they are Oscar quality.",10,0,0,5 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Just another Star Wars clone? No!
","Let me start off by saying, do NOT listen to the wind bags that are bent to ruin this movie. It was great. I can't see why anyone could not like this movie. There is action and Natalie Portman for the guys; Hayden Christensen and love for the girls; Star Wars itself for the kids; Nostalgia for the fans; and a great plot for the intellectuals. Theoretically, this is the perfect movie. Go see it in the theaters and help fight the battle between Spiderman.",10,0,0,16 May 2002
