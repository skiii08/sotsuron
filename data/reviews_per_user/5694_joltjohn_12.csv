Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Good start to the series but Not a great Movie onn its own
","I was eagerly awaiting the DVD release of any Star Wars movie, even The Phantom Menace. Then when it was released on DVD  it was hammered by fans of the original three Star Wars adventures, but I think we all know why that is. Most of the rabid fans saw Star Wars as youths and as they grew older, they held on to the magic of the movies. This is great, I think and I like the original films too, but when The Phantom Menace rolled around, these fans were no longer youths, but adults instead. Just as the original films were aimed at a younger audience, so is The Phantom Menace and as such, the grown up fans were displeased. Yes, this is a silly, wild ride through the Star Wars realm, with annoying characters and tons of merchandising potential. But come on, so were the original three movies and while an argument could be made for Empire, A New Hope and Return of the Jedi are clearly aimed toward the younger folks. And while the fans ignore the countless plot holes and annoying characters in the original trilogy, they lambaste The Phantom Menace, simply because it wasn't 'how they remembered Star Wars to be,' what a joke. This installment has some classic scenes and some bad ones, just like the original films, period.Also this film seamlessly merged animation and live action, and  ought to be considered one of the most important, dazzling, ground-breaking movies ever made. This 1999 production, which brought director George Lucas out of a quasi retirement, revealed that some of his skills had rusted, particularly his feel for dialog and his feel for casting. His subsequent shepherding of that dialog through that cast leaves much to be desired . . Then you have the introductory nature of the story itself and the political stuff. This slower pacing turned off people expecting a major epic like stuff found in the Galactic Civil War that was chronicled in Episodes IV, V, and VI. Also, a lot of the time the movie seems disjointed. You go from fast action to long periods of slow scenes before getting back into anything else.
On a positive note  this  is a  perfect example of what a DVD film can and should be, the new 2-disc Fox release of the 4th 'Star Wars' film (though it is the first episode of the epic story) is impressive indeed. Well, this isn't the same Phantom Menace you saw in the theater. Including about three minutes of new footage, this transfer has been struck from the same high-definition master created for the video and broadcast releases over a year ago, albeit with the new additions. The 5.1-channel Dolby Digital sound, which has EX enhancements, whips up the film's excitements at every turn. The bass is aggressive, the surround effects are distinctive and plentiful, and the film's sound mix is as creative and pervasive as its special effects. Presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen, and THX-certified to boot, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace boasts a generally stunning, though not quite perfect transfer.Another way to look at this movie is that on it's own, for non-or casual Star Wars fans it's a rather cruddy movie with one or two cool sequences. As for regular Star Wars fans, they  see the movie as the introductory chapter of a six-chapter book that is just meant to show where the major players come from and set up the next two chapters in the prequel trilogy.  Again, the movie is just the beginning and some people weren't expecting that. Personally seeing how Palpatine rose to power is kind of cool, but for non-fans it's a bore.*************spoiler alert*************************** Two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his young Padawan learner Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) have been sent to settle the dispute, but things don't quite go as planned. This opening scene is one of the first things that caused people to question the continuity of the prequel. Obi-Wan told Luke that Yoda trained him, but the first time you see him in Episode I, he is with Qui-Gon. Young Ben mentions in this scene that Yoda tells him to be mindful of the future, and in the audio commentary George Lucas explains that a Jedi would be trained in the temple (where Yoda is) until about eight or nine and then he will become a padawan to a Jedi Knight. So all is well so far in the continuity department.As the negotiations go sour, the two Jedi sneak onto a droid army invasion force landing craft and go down to Naboo where Qui-Gon runs into the completely CGI created character Jar Jar Binks . Ok, Jar Jar. As with almost everyone else I cringed when he first opened his mouth, and yes I do think that he is too much of a clumsy presence in the movie and is way overdone. The Pod Race sequence as it was in the original version was a ride that many thought was worth the price of admission alone. From the incredible sound featuring specific engine sounds for each pod, to the ultra fast CGI effects, the race was very fun.Before that happens, the dreaded Midichlorian explanation rears its ugly head. So instead of being just an energy field that binds the galaxy together that some people are able to sense, the Force is drawn to people by microscopic life forms called Midichlorians. This revelation p***ed off fans even more than Jar Jar (if that is possible...) and it looks like it isn't going anywhere. In the audio commentary Lucas addresses the Midichlorians and basically says that he always wanted to explain why some people could use the Force and others couldn't and the Midichorians were the way. That doesn't help the matter as it changed one of the central things of the Star Wars Mythos and that along with Jar Jar are the two gaping wounds on the movie for me.Obviously the best one of the four scenes is the dual. It's exactly what people were expecting in a new Star Wars movie and it is my absolute favorite scene in the movie. You have two Jedi from the time when the Jedi were in their prime fighting off an expertly trained Sith Lord. It's the ultimate Star Wars fanboy scene.On the other hand, the Gungan battle with the Battle Droids is the ultimate Jar Jar haters' nightmare as it is basically nothing but Jar Jar accidentally killing a bunch of droids. It is a great effects scene as it is pretty much 100% CGI, but still. By the time you get to this scene in the movie, you are absolutely sick of Jar Jar and you just want him to go away.
The same thing could almost be said about the space battle as Anakin accidentally crash lands inside the Droid Control Ship and then accidentally fires off two torpedoes into the main reactor to blow it up. Sure, Anakin is a great pilot, and yes the Force is extremely strong with him, but that all is just a little two convenient even for a fully trained Jedi Knight much less an eight year old boy.In the final analysis The Phantom Menace is a fun, but brisk and light romp, one that the entire family can take time and again. This two disc edition from Fox is more than up to task, so if you're at all interested, The Phantom Menace is recommended.even though it's the worst of the four current movies but still very enjoyable  Also both the Star Wars fan and DVD fan in me were not disappointed. The disc has plenty of great extras and an absolutely fantastic presentation that fits with the theme of the movie perfectly. I gave it an 8/10.",8,0,1,14 December 2002
Beauty and the Beast," A good fun movie not oscar quality
","First the good points.The only animated movie to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination, and it didn't  deserved it.let's look at how well the movie works. You have a monster who's more human than the movie's man villain; you have a heroine who's PC but engaging with it; you have a supporting cast of magic utensils who wisely never upstage the couple at the centre of this love story (and despite the Disney animated trappings, it IS a love story); and you have ' A TALE AS OLD AS TIME'captivatLY and beautifully told.The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear; and Alan Menken's score is his finest work with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman the songs themselves are good,but rather the way they are presented - for example, the opening song with Belle - personally I didn't really get why the WHOLE TOWN was singing about Belle. I know it's called 'suspension of disbelief', but I still wasn't that fond of that scene.'Like Gaston' was the best tune, and the scene of course was great followed by 'kill the beast' for it's fun lyrics. Humor here is fun (the final battle scene between the servants-cum-appliances/whatever and Gaston's mob - such as when the one guy is eaten by a closet and comes out dressed in a bikini with Marge Simpson hair).  Also the way that Lamier and Cogsworth are towards each other is quite funny at times.Gaston, one of my all time favorite Disney villains. Gaston is so complex. One minute, he's just an arrogant, stuck-up bum that is reminisicent of someone we all know and find irritating. Yet, he manages to add a little humor in his attempts to woo Belle. Then, he turns into a real jerk, willing to lock Maurice up to get Belle. And finally, he becomes pure evil, ready to kill the Beast to win Belle. That mocking laugh and look he gives the Beast when he says, 'What's the matter? Too kind and gentle to fight back?' is one of the greatest scenes in Disney villainry history. A rare few scenes rank up with the amount of evil emotion that this scene has, such as Scar giving Mufasa an incredibly horrifying look before murdering him, or Jafar laughing like an insane lunatic after banishing Aladdin, Abu, and Carpet to the Ends of the Earth. Great moments that illustrate just how dark a villain can be. Now the not soo good points or FLAWS THAT ARE TOLABLE Plot holes: When the enchantress shows up disguised as an old beggar woman, the prince answers the door. Why is he doing this, when he has servants to answer the door for him?  Also here he looks like an older teenager when according to the story he was 11 years old when this happened.How can Bell's father build such a complicated machine (wood cutter) if doesn't know what tools to use on it. Why does it seem the horse is smarter than Bell's father when they get  lost in the woods.  The horse wants to go down the less scary path but Bell's father chooses the scarier path (go figure). I like the homage to 'sound of Music' when Bell runs up the green hill singing after she rejectes Gaston's proposal' That horse of Bell's must be part hound dog to know where Bell's father ended up in the castle.  (remember the horse took off before Bell's father made it to the castle). Lumier (the candlestick) must be extra magical by the way he can ignite himself anytime he wants.The musical number 'Be our Guest' is way to 'disney' in that it's style and presentation has been done in too many other movies.  Although the song 'Human Again' musical sequence was excellently done and a most welcome addition for the movie's special edition release it was done to Disney' for my liking also.
VERY BIG FLAWS THAT TAKE AWAY FROM THIS BEING A 10/10 MOVIEBell must be 'super woman' by the way lifts up the Beast onto the  horse to take him back to the castle, even though he must weigh about 300 pounds (after wolf pack battle). And again later when she holds the beast so he doesn't fall off the roof at the end of his battle with Gastou.How did chip figure out how to work the 'wood cutter' and start the fire and control the direction it went when it was parked on top of the hill. (huh?)THEORY: when Bell goes into the west wing and into the Beast's private room, she does notice his human picture (she pulls up the torn sections)  So she knows that the Beast is really human.  So that is why she falls in love with him.  She knows from all the fiction books she read that there must be a way to turn him back into a man.  That is why she acts the way she does toward him. Why isn't  Bell or her father or the towns people spooked by all the 'living' items they encounters in the castle.Continuity: The seasons change several times throughout the movie. When Maurice is thrown out of the pub, he lands in a pile of snow. When others leave, the pile is not there. Gaston and others are wearing short-sleeved shirts in the snow. When Belle and the beast go outside (in the winter) after dancing, they are in shirt sleeves and crickets are heard.  Also in the final act Bell arrives home (it's still winter) Then later that night apparently,  during the climatic scene between The Beast and Gastou (it's starts raining). Continuity: At the beggining, the Beast scratches his own painting from top-left to bottom-right, later Belle discovers the paint and it's scratched from top-right to bottom-left.Continuity: After the Gaston song, the bear rug moves from behind the chair to under the chair.
FINAL VERDICTI see 'Beauty and the Beast' as one of those movies that you watch over and over  again if you are in the right frame of mind like 'leaving your brain at the door' and ignoring all the continuity problems and pot holes that show up.  then you can relive the magic and atmosphere of the film  and be taken in by the movie's very real heart that makes it a keeper.  8/10",8,1,4,24 January 2003
Grease," A good movie with even better musical numbers
","Grease as a movie is a  good movie.  Just like Footloose, it is the songs and the dancing in it that make it so enduring and rewatchable. I think the acting is okay for the most part. The best performance comes from Stockard Channing as Rizzo the leader of the Pink Ladies.  She has the most complex character to play and she pulls it off very well. I think the actions of the T-Birds minor players, Doodie, Sunny, Putzzie are immature and stupid and don't seem to fit in with Danny   and Kenickie coolness and take away from this movie; just like Jar Jar  ruined Star Wars everytime he was in a scene.  Look even their names are dumb. THe least enjoyable song and dance number was 'Beauty school Dropout' because i thought it was an unneccesarry  detour in  the movie. The best song and dance number was 'You're the One I Want' because I liked Oliva Newton John in that black outfit and 'Summer Nights' because of  the way Danny and Sandy are singing together. I was more interested in following the relationship between Rizzo and Kenickie which had more layers and complications to it thAN OF Danny and Sandy which was simply a love story of bad boy and good girl falling for each other. There are  a lot of subtle and not so subtle references to taboo stuff, like teenage sex, oral sex, condum use, pregnacy, corutption of a minor by a tv personality, underage drinking and smoking, street racing and how the best way to get someone to love you is to change who you are even if that means dressing like some street walker; which I found surprising in a movie from the 1970's aimed at it's target audience of young people. So overall this movie is enjoyable and gets 8/10 in my books",8,1,3,3 November 2002
Footloose," A Great Movie to Dance to.
","I really like this movie because it has such a great soundtrack. It takes me back to my youth in the 1980's. The plot and non-musical scenes are okay to watch. The cast do a good job but the story is rather bland.  The best performannce is is given by John Lithgow as the the preacher. I love the Dvd version for the great reproduction of the songs.  If you like a movie that makes get up and Move your groove thing or want to relieve those fabulous 1980's, than get this movie.",9,0,2,1 November 2002
Flashdance," a good date night movie (you can make out between the songs)
","I just watched 'Flashdance' for the first time and it is a film so lame, inconsequential and annoyingly dumb that it actually made the comparably silly 'Footloose' look like 'Singing in the Rain' by comparison. Actually, I'm being too hard on 'Footloose,' since it actually had a plot, some interesting characters, and a point-of-view (to say nothing of a POINT), as opposed to the pointless and silly 'Flashdance.' which was like 'Rocky' with a dance motif and female star.I hope you don't take my 'critique' the wrong way... Honestly, I don't think the movie is really all that good, but the message, and the feeling, and the spirit of this movie, are all very wonderful and infectious indeed and should NOT be discounted. It makes it a wonderful movie.  It is a story of energy, of feeling and of life The story seems utterly predictable and rather contrived, and the characters are weak. The music (which I *do* remember well from that time) is still excellent, and some of the dance routines are inventive. Others were pretty bad. like the  closing dance routine which is as bad  a dance scene as you'll ever see in any movie. The final dance scene In 'Footloose' was much better. also  did you know a man was actually doing that twirly move and that Jennifer Beals didn't dance at all, actually they used about four stunt doubles).  For a dance movie, Flashdance doesn't show that much dancing. Even the gorgeous Jennifer Beals (and her dance doubles doing all those dance numbers.( I wonder if she has that huge curly perm -although fashionable at 1983 - only to shadow the face of her double. ) couldn't hold my interest. As short as Flashdance was, I was looking at my watch about halfway through.The best parts of this movie are the  'music videos' and the soundtrack in the film is fantastic, it makes you the feel, the passion come alive as it drives the story and gives it a soul. It is that fantastic soundtrack that makes that, and the whole film for that matter, simply come alive. Beals is one of the few reasons to watch this movie. She is not bad at all as an actress! And she is sexy, cute and pretty. She has a very attractive smile and shows sometimes a very sexy body language. The worst parts are the dance performances which destroys the whole movie. Also the dialogs wasn't really good or interesting.  Unfortunately, there are some really ungainly jokes in the film(re: 'honkies', small penises, Polish jokes, a gross lesbian joke, and a real stinker about cockroaches in hamburgers--this is funny??), but the basic outline of the picture, corny though it may be, still works a little magic.SPOILERS, BEWARE!!! Some things I really don't like about this movie: It seems that she is the only female working at the mill.  Also if  a female co-worker started dating the male boss a lot of people would think she was doing it to get ahead and not cheer them on like in the movie.  Why would any reasonable 'male' go to a club just to see women dance in skimpy clothes.  I can see that going to any regular nite-club.When she first dances to the song 'maniac' and they cut to shot of her dog it looks like he is getting 'excited' watching her.   That  scene with the traffic cop, what what that all about?  Some things do confuse me about it (e.g. Jeanie asks Alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing; Alex replies 'About 25 years,' isn't Alex supposed to be 18?)  Also, if Alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work? When she doesn't go to work for nearly a week, wouldn't she be laid off? Living in a warehouse-I can almost see it, but not quite. It doesn't seem right that she's a welder, owns a warehouse house, AND is trying to get into ballet. None of it really makes sense.To summerize, Flashdance will never make the AFI's Top 100, but it has an infectious charm. Jennifer Beals is really only so-so in the leading role, and her leading man Michael Nouri is no better off, but it doesn't matter. What does matter here is the great music, especially that title track that may be the most inspirational show .tune since the theme from Rocky. Really, the whole film is played like a 90-minute ad for MTV! Laugh at the dopey plot and listen to the great tunes. Great film to earmark the 80s. Short on plot, but big on rock and roll and performance, especially by Beals, who excels as a welder (and semi-erotic dancer) who has dreams of ballet. I guess I'm recommending the film. I still find myself humming the title song.",6,1,3,13 December 2002

Driven," aa good dvd to showcase your 5.1 sound system
","Sylvester Stallone simply can't seem to catch a break. Judge Dredd caused the star to be something of a joke with lines like 'I am the law!'. An attempt at an independent comeback in 'Copland' actually offered quite a good performance, but the film went largely unnoticed. 'Driven' was another film that was written by the star (as was 'Rocky' and 'Cliffhanger'), but reviews and word of mouth kept audiences away. While not quite as poor as many made the film out to be (mainly thanks to flashy, entertaining direction by Renny Harlin), the film relies on cliches instead of bringing anything new to the table. Not that anyone's really brought anything new to the racing genre - 'Days of Thunder' wasn't terrible, but it wasn't exactly much of a success, either. 'Driven' plays like the racing version of Oliver Stone's football film 'Any Given Sunday'. This picture has the same sort of flash and striking cinematography, but it forgets the character development that the previous film at least was partially successful with. In fact, the cars remain the real stars of the movie here.Stallone plays Joe Tanto, a former ace race car driver who's been out of the business for years, but asked to return by old friend Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds), who wants the old pro to ride alongside the new rookie, Jimmy Blye (Kip Pardue). Their competition is Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger). There's even a romantic triangle shoehorned into the plot, as Sophia (Estella Warren) moves back and forth between the two young racers.There's several factors that make 'Driven' suffer, though. Besides the lackluster nature of the screenplay, the performances are not particularly good, especially the two newcomers who play the competing racers. The only performance that really manages to shine is Warren. The former swimmer and Sports Illustrated model really does have a terrific presence and, impressively, is able to make the stereotypical lines of dialogue sound genuine. Hopefully, after performances here and in 'Planet of the Apes', she'll move on to bigger and better things. Gina Gershon is stuck playing the Stallone character's ex-wife in a shrill subplot that goes nowhere. As for Stallone, he doesn't do a great deal here, nor does he seem to want to as he mostly appears content to set in the background and let the younger stars have their moment.7/10",7,1,1,3 January 2003
Slap Shot," I've seen this movie too many times, but it still makes one laugh. Some of the humor is dated, goes back to the 70's, but its still enjoyable too watch.
","Slapshot is my favorite sports movie for a lot of reasons, but the one that sticks out the most is this: it is not like every other run-of-the-mill sports films. Unlike Major League or Unnecessary Roughness [both of which I like], it isn't about a bunch of misfits who stink but then find the will and way to win. Slapshot is about a bunch of guys who have the talent to win but can't, but eventually find the way. In the first game, we see that Ned Braden is the league's leading scorer. A few guys speak little English, which would add to their troubles. The team had some hope. Yes, it wasn't until the Hansens showed up that the team started to win, but the Hansens brought in a whole new aspect to the movie: to play fairly and lose, or to play the dirtiest hockey ever and win the whole thing? Another thing that makes it great is that its not a pro team, instead its a minor league in some part of America, we don't know where. Another great thing about Slapshot is that the only person you've ever heard of or seen before or after is Paul Newman, who isn't even the most popular character! Slap Shot is without a doubt, the greatest hockey movie ever made. If profanity and violence are your thing, that this is your movie! If you are a major hockey buff, this is your film! If you like to laugh, this is your moving picture!  It seems like massive beatings are handed out by the second! Enough blood to fill a small swimming pool... not to mention enough profanity to last for the rest of your life... but hey, that's hockey! Any hockey fan will tell you that this movie is the best in the genre, so why should I tell you different?  Also Slap Shot' takes the time to investigate an array of pro sports themes: sadistic player violence; boorish sexuality; fan behavior; fan loyalty to athletes and vice-versa (or total absence thereof); the bloodless, detached world of athletic club ownership. But the film is better than the snide satire it has been portrayed to be, and in its own manic way, it conveys much of the joy of sports. That was what made some of the films of the 70's great. They weren't the predictable fare we see today. Big stars weren't above making character movies or just having some plain old, goofy fun. What other decade gave you Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now and Superman? 'Slap Shot' is a movie that is more than the foul language or the violence. It's about a hockey team's last ditch effort to save itself. Reggie Dunlop may con and manipulate his way to the championship, but that's what is great about his character and this movie, and that is the psychology within. There's something in all of us that is like Dunlop and his players...we're all underdogs, we fight for what we believe in and may even be a little underhanded to get to where we need to get. More important, Dunlop has something to prove...that he can be a winner, and he can be successful. It's what he wants for himself, and for his players. Also the characters and the subplots still have me laughing out loud: Dunlop putting a bounty on a competing player's head, the rug-wearing radio announcer (wonderfully played by Andrew Duncan), the French Canadian goaltender (Yvon Barrette) , the underhanded general manager (the late, great Strother Martin), the unexpected striptease by the Chiefs leading scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) which catches many players, who were beating each other on the ice, totally off guard. I love the line by Ogle Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd, Nancy's brother) after beating up a Chief player and then seeing Braden taking his uniform off: 'This is disgusting....' How about that for irony! The only thing that could improve this movie is for their to be more Hansons arrive and to see them do funny things like beat people up in creative ways   Paul Newman sees the 'Boys' playing with their slot cars and comments that they 'brought their TOYS with them!' on the road trip. This is funny and should have been explored more, but it isn't. As a matter of fact, the Hanson's and their background are not explored at all, and they have a small amount of total screen time. This is too bad because they are the best part of the movie. . But if you are like me and want to see cool hockey footage of guys playing without helmets, wacky stuff happening at the rink, the Hanson brothers doing their thing, etc. , there just isn't enough of it there. If this movie was made today, there would be less social commentary, less human interest, more Hansons, and more hockey. And, sadly, it would probably be a better movie because of it.",8,0,3,26 January 2003
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Not to scarey not to sweet the perfect mix
","Nightmare Before Christmas' is the remarkable production from the mind of Tim Burton and the skills of director Henry Selick. Working together to wrap the package up perfectly is the wonderful score from composer Danny Elfman. The film is so many things; it's a smart kids film, it's got wonderful animation and so much imagination in every detail of its presentation of this amazing world that's been created. The stop-motion animation is absolutely stunning - you look at every frame and ponder how long it took to prepare even that second of the picture.'The Nightmare Before Christmas' finds Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween town. Year after year, he's tired of everything scary and Halloween in general. One day, he takes a far walk into a magical forest, where doors with symbols of holidays are on trees. Jack doesn't seen anything too interesting - except the tree with the shiny ornaments and decorations. He opens the door and is transported into a magical place - Christmastown. Jack soon becomes obsessed with Christmas and plans to bring Christmas to Halloweentown, and all over. However, Jack's plans to kidnap Santa Claws go awry, and so do a lot of things, creating an enjoyable and warm movie. This  is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and each time I watch it I always find something new. This is a movie which everyone can enjoy and should be in everyone's library.  10/10",10,1,2,22 December 2002
A Bug's Life," a great movie for bugs and people everywhere
","Everything that was great about Toy Story, Pixar's first feature (and the first-ever all-computer animated movie), is even greater in A Bug's Life. Visually, this movie is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor. Its environments are far more ambitious than Toy Story's, and they deliver with far more nuance and texture. There are more characters in this movie, and they're a little better played. And the story is cute-- it deals with Flik, an outcast ant (Dave Foley) who is sent away by the colony's princess (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find some 'tough bugs' to fight off the oppressive grasshoppers, led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who steal the ants' food. Flik finds a bunch of circus-performer bugs, and mistakes them for fighters, and takes them back to the colony to save the bugs from the grasshoppers. Humor follows. Humor for the whole family. This film has great moments, like when the ants can't figure out how to get around a leaf that has fallen in front of them(although I didn't quite get that, since I would think the ants could see over the leaf, but I guess I was putting too much thought into it.) As many great visual moments as the film has, I just couldn't help feel that it's trapped by the Disney formula of one unlikely hero rising above 'it all' to save the day. Again, the animation is wonderful and, to be honest, although it's more safe feeling than 'Antz', 'A Bug's Life' does do a better job at providing the scope of this miniature world, from the leaves and grass to the stones and ant tunnels.  I did like the fact that the film is in the wide 2.35:1 ratio, making the wide spaces of the grassy colony and the insect city more fascinating to watch.  High marks once again. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack never misses a beat. All of the dialogue comes from the position of its speaker on screen. Sometimes stereo effects are very hot or cold-- they're either all the way right, all the way left, or straight center. Not the case here. If a character so much as turns his or her head while speaking, it's reflected in the sound field. Excellent.  And the score by Randy Newman sounds great and never overpowers the dialogue or sound. Above all, this movie is visually stunning. STUNNING. It is amazing to watch. 9 out of 10",10,0,1,14 December 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," One man's life touches so many others, when he's not there it leaves an awfully big hole
","There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born?  The values of 'It's A Wonderful Life' still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!In this film James Stewart  acts so naturally you forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. 'It's a Wonderful Life' details the life of George Bailey, a man who put the needs and well being of others before his his whole life.  Later in the film he feels he is a failure and is on the verge of suicide. He is taken by his guardian angel in need of his wings, Clarence (Henry Travers), who shows him just how important he has been. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film.  Ultimately, it is perhaps the most emotionally moving film ever made, and it offers insight that everybody can use about what's important in our lives.  To phrase a heavily used cliche, this is one of the few movies that gets better with every viewing, and never loses any of its power. And the icing on the cake is where, after George finds that he has his daughter Zuzu's petals in his coat and runs home to his family to find how much they love him, many of his friends come to his aid to help him in replacing the $8000 that went into Mr.Potter's hands before.  This part of 'It's A Wonderful Life' moves me to tears and can help many people look at their own lives in a new light,especially when one is in despair and feels that their life is worthless.  10/10",10,2,6,9 November 2002
