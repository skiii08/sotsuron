Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disappointed with this movie
","I had a lot of expectations with this movie. I had read many good things about it. i felt completely disappointed when I got out of the theatre. I was expecting an intelligent X-ray to the American society even better than Michael Moore's documentaries (at least, this is how the movie was promoted in Argentina). My feelings with this movie are: a) a complete lack of respect with Kazakhstan. I cannot imagine how I had felt if instead of Kazakhstan, the fake country had been Argentina. If Kazakhstanis are offended, I'm with them. b) not very clever. just obvious jokes. c) Borat's behaviour is not politically correct, but i do not consider very difficult (or at least an important thing to watch) to be sitting at a table with a group of people and tell one of them that her wife is ugly. In other words, I'd rather watch Michael Moore's documentaries if I want to understand a little bit of Americans, and some TV show to laugh at people caught in tricks, but not in a serious movie as Borat pretends to be....7 nominations to the Oscars !!! come on !!",4,4,8,9 February 2007
