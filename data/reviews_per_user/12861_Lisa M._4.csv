The Blair Witch Project," That's It?!!!
","I don't watch horror movies; haven't for years since being terrified by Alien and turning off the TV halfway through it.  But I decided to see The Blair Witch Project with my husband (who likes good horror movies) because of all the amazing hype surrounding the movie, and because I was curious what a couple of barely-out-of-college filmmakers had done that everyone was saying was so creative.  I told my husband I'd probably have to leave mid-way through the movie, since I was prepared to be scared out of my wits. Wrong.  There was not one scary moment in this entire movie.  We both sat there, waiting for the scary stuff to begin, and it never happened.  This was one of the worst, most boring movies I've ever seen.  Yeah, the premise was fairly creative and a good way to make a movie on a $30,000 budget, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a bad movie.  I got really tired of seeing jerky camera footage and the three actors saying the same things over and over (f**k, we're lost!!).  Not to mention the fact that the three characters had a wilderness survival guide and managed not to know that if you're lost in the woods and find a stream of water, you can often follow it to civilization!  Also, they kept filming themselves as they got more and more terrified, and how real is that?  You're awakened in the middle of the night by strange noises (which we couldn't hear well at all in the theater; bad sound effects) in a supposedly haunted woods, and you stop to grab the camera to film everything?  The piles of rocks and stick figures that were supposed to terrify the audience left me yawning.  The people sitting next to us in the theater had the same reaction we did.This is an example of what Hollywood hype can do for a bad movie and of how critics will grab onto anything remotely different without stopping to really examine whether it's a good film.  Honestly, this movie is like the Emperor with no clothes -- when are critics going to start telling the truth about The Blair Witch Project?  I can't believe the supposed experts, the critics, who are saying that this is one of the scariest movies ever made. What a joke!  At least we saw a matinee and only wasted $8.50.  Don't waste your money.  I give this one star.",1,1,3,18 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Is this all there is?!!
","I don't watch horror movies.  Haven't since being scared out of my wits by Alien on TV and turning it off halfway through.  But I decided to see BWP because of all the incredible hype surrounding the movie, and because I wanted to see what a couple of college film school graduates had come up with.  My husband and I went (he likes good horror movies), and we were both left wondering what on earth all the hype was about.  Neither of us (nor the folks sitting next to us) were scared for one minute.  I honestly don't get all the buzz around this film -- it's just three college students running around with hand-held cameras, getting scared by piles of rocks and stick figures.  The noises that were supposedly scaring them out of their wits at night couldn't even be heard clearly in our theater.  And Heather really got on my nerves -- during the interviews in the beginning, she kept interrupting the people she was interviewing or otherwise interjecting comments, which was annoying.  And -- correct me if I'm wrong, because I've never read a lost-in-the- woods-survival book in my life -- but can't you follow a stream and usually find civilization?!  To those who are saying that anyone who doesn't like this film has to have huge special effects to enjoy a horror movie, think again -- I did watch a few of Hitchcock's masterpieces and was scared out of my wits, with almost zero special effects.  I am just mystified at the critics who are giving this 4 stars and saying it's one of the scariest movies ever made.  What a joke!!  Thank goodness we went to a matinee and only wasted $8.50.",1,1,4,12 August 1999
Se7en," Scary as hell
","Warning:  may contain minor spoilers (probably nothing you wouldn't see on the video jacket)I watched this on video over the weekend and was glued to my seat and scared out of my wits.  I didn't see Seven in the theater when it originally came out because I thought it would be too gory and creepy, but am I glad I decided to see it.  This is a superbly crafted psychological drama/thriller with great acting by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as two detectives on the trail of a serial killer caught up in religious fervor who happens to be extremely intelligent.  The killer chooses his victims based on the 'seven deadly sins' (gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath) and can only be described as extremely creative in the ways he kills and tortures his victims.  I was afraid the movie might be too gory for me, but I managed to stay in my seat, only covering my eyes a couple of times.  The director successfully creates a mounting tension as the story unfolds, and the unexpected ending will leave you speechless -- one of the best movie endings I've seen.  As my husband said, 'whoever wrote this script must be slightly off just to have been able to think of it!'  Watch this movie if you haven't already, preferably not by yourself.  I give it a 9.5 out of 10.",10,0,0,23 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Worth the ticket price
","I liked this movie.  It was perhaps not fair to The Sixth Sense that the night before I rented 'Seven' and was on the edge of my seat the entire time (if you haven't seen Seven yet, rent it!), so this film was probably unfairly influenced by my having seen an incredibly tightly written and acted thriller the night before.  Still, The Sixth Sense is a fine movie with plenty of psychological suspense.  I liked the premise -- that the spirits of dead people can communicate with certain 'chosen' ones among us -- and the ending is indeed totally unexpected, as I'd read on this site. The young actor who plays Cole, Haley Joel Osment, was excellent in portraying a terrified child who doesn't want the gift he was born with, and even Bruce Willis was decent (I don't usually like Willis's acting, which I think is typically one dimensional, not to mention his trade-mark smirk).  I give The Sixth Sense 7.5 out of 10.",8,0,0,23 August 1999
