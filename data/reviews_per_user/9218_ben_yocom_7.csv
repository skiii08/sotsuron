Casablanca," a clasic love story impossible to spoil
",The classic love story Casablanca is very well known. Many phrases in use today come from that movie even some that aren't actually said such as `play it again Sam' which is never actually said in the movie. Other phrases that come from this movie and are `of all the gin joints ion all the world she has to walk in to mine' and `we'll always have Paris.' These sayings have become imbedded in American society as has much of the movie. People who have never seen know details such as the plain scene. This movie uses combination of very simple filming techniques and great sets. This reviewer would argue that the reason this movie is so well liked is because it is easy to relate to on one level while on another level being spectacular and seemingly impossible. There is a story of lost love which is easily related to by most people then the fantasy of finding them again after you have been separated for a very long time appeals even more to those who have loved and lost.,Null,0,1,8 June 2004
Citizen Kane," Great
","Citizen Kane is perhaps the most original movie ever made. This movie can be credited to only one man who stared in, produced, directed, and help write the screenplay for this movie. This mans name was Orson Wells who at the time was a nobody when it came to movies was only 25 when this movie came out his now famous and highly revered film (citizen Kane).This movie was unique in many regards. One of the ways in which it was unique is in the angles in which it was filmed, wells used many different new angles to show emotion. Wells also employed numerous lighting techniques in his new film. Also (even though there was access to color film) Wells used black and white film. These decisions and the originality of the screen play lead to this movie huge success. The reason the screenplay was so original is the way in which it used time and flashbacks. The movie is about the investigation of one mans life to try and find out what one word means ârosebudâ. The entire movie could be summed up in that one word. Though the characters in the story never find out what ârosebudâ is by the end the viewer is left with some understanding of what it means. The name of the man that the movie is focused on is Charles foster Kane. The story of his life is a some what idealistic one, a rags to riches story, but in return for his good fortune and wealth he looses every thing he ever loved even saying him self âif I hadnât been rich I may have been a great manâ when asked he thought he was he replied âI think I did alright under the circumstancesâ. These quotes speak wonders of Kane's personality it says that he doesnât think rightly of the person he has become. Kane also seems to lead a double life in part of this movie. One of these lives is as a multimillion heir the other is as the operator of a newspaper. This double life is shown when Kane directly says â as you may have noticed I am leading a double life one as the editor of this news paper and the other as the holder of the worlds six largest private fortune in the worldâ.  He seems to be a man who has lost every thing he has ever had and everyone that is talked to points out this fact.This movie gave a lot to the film industry and is credited as being the best movie of all time many people. And though the plot may be hard to follow in the end the viewer learns a valuable lesson. This reviewer would rate this movie a 10 out 10 a perfect example of what a film should be.",10,1,3,16 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," when Johnny comes marching home will never be the same
","Dr.Strangelove is a dark comedy that has a very specific message. This message is one that is completely against what was done in the cold war and the paranoia that in consumed the minds of those who have to make word altering decisions. The most obvious of these paranoia's was present in the character Jack D. Ripper who was afraid of fluoridation which was a fear during the cold war the U.S.S.R was planning to sabotage all of the U.S drinking water. To the viewer who knows what fluoridation is this seems to be the reason why he is so obsessed with his `precious bodily fluids'	In this movie names were given with much thought though some of them may not be obvious. The obvious ones include Jack D. Ripper, `King' Kong, and `Bat' Guano. Some of the not so obvious may be Turgidson (turgid meaning swollen or highly embellished which suits the character perfectly) and Mandrake (mandrake being a European plant with narcotic properties and is also said to resemble a human this description may or may not be a reason the name was chosen). 	Music for this movie was chosen to show how idiotic it all was but also the song `Johnny comes marching home' was chosen and played every time the focus was on `King' Kong's plane. Anyone who has heard the original song called `Johnny I hardly knew ya' knows this may have been chosen to show the evils of such events and to those that do not know the lyric of `Johnny I hardly knew ya' it continues past when Johnny comes marching home again hurrah to say with drums and guns and guns and drums Harrah with drums and guns and guns and drums  the enemy nearly slue your darling john its been so long Johnny I hardly knew ya.where are eyes that were so mild  why did you run from me and the child.where are your legs that used to run  when first you went to carry a gun.you haven't an arm and you haven't a leg. If the viewers knows this version of the song it means something completely different when they play it for the men in the planes going to their almost certain death.	Dr.Strangelove sends a very direct massage when he is in the war room and is calling the president `Mein Fuhrer' and also when he stands up out of his wheel chair and says `Mein Fuhrer I can walk' he is sending the image of savoir and also murder to the minds of those watching.",Null,0,1,23 March 2004
Some Like It Hot," HOW DID THEY GET AWAY WITH IT?
",Some like it hot written and directed in the 50's is a very sexually orientated movie. One from this time period generally thinks of the 50's as a very clean a pure time area with the classic nuclear family as it's backbone but this movie portrays a much different image and with Marilyn Monroe as the staring actress succeeds. This movie does something most people never thought of when they thought of the 50's these things include cross dressing and gay relationships. This movie is a mixture of a comedy and a love story. Shot in black and white this movie at first glance to be a classic film but as the viewer watches they relies that it most certainly is not your classic 50's film. The plot of this movie is very see through and has nothing really to it but the viewer can't help but appreciate it for the way it affected society and T.V today.,Null,1,4,11 April 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," great
","It's a Wonderful Life is a great movie that touches on a question that everyone has asked themselves at one time or another. This question is 'what would the world be like with out me?' The answer for this question is explored through the main character that because of his lack of achevements in his life feels that he has done more harm then good. This movie could be divided up into three parts the first part is when he is a child the second part is when he is an adult but a younger adult and the last part is when he is an older adult.This movie is about a man who thinks that because he didn't do any thing he wanted to do when he was a kid that his life is a failed one. This movie follows him from when he was just a child up until he wants to commits suicide in when he is about thirty or forty years old. The movie does this in a rather clever way by an angel telling the story of his life to another angel that is to protect George Baily from himself. The viewers first introduction to George is when he is just a child and is sleding in this scene George's brother falls through the ice, George jumps in after him and save his life. This scene was done to introduce something the George that was good and that at the end of the movie would be brought up. The next scene is George a little older and he is at work talking to two girls about what he wants to do when he is older. It apears from this scene that George has a great imagination and also at this early age he relises that he doesn't want to stay in his home town. This scene also is one that ties in to the end for in this scene George prevents his boss from delivering pills that were inadvertently poisoned. Scene continue like this for a little while showing good things that he did and expanding on his dreams.
When he s a younger adult he is confronted with a problem, either he goes off and lives his dream and fathers life work and the last chance most of the people in his town to live a decent life goes down the drain or he can stay and work a job that he hates in a town he has wanted out of since he was just a young boy and help those people in his town who need it and further his fathers work. This decision does not come easily to him though he makes it time and again. He ends up helping hundreds of people in his town start business and build houses much to the dissatisfaction of the villain of this movie who is a greedy stubborn old man who would not give loans to any of the people that George and even if he did the people would not be able to afford them. George is given several opportunities to get out of his town and to leave his job but chooses to help his family and friends instead.The third part of this movie is when George is on the verge of committing suicide and is saved by his gaurdian angel and is shown how the world would be with out him. The scene of the world without him is not a pretty one all his friends are poor and have horrible lives and his brother whom he saved as a young boy is dead drowned at the age of eight. George is greatly affected by this vision and changes his out look on life. He is now happy about the choices that he has made and acts as if he wouldn't change them even if he could.",Null,0,6,5 January 2004
Rear Window," Great
","In an attempt not to ruin this movie for anyone reading this review I will refrain from discussing plot elements and I will focus more on the genius in the way it is filmed and the music that is used in the movie.
This movie was filmed entirely in one set that was built indoors this is part of the genius of this movie. The entire movie is filmed from the point of view of one mans apartment and in the entire movie the view only leaves the apparent once. The view of this mans window over looks a courtyard that is in the middle of four other apartment buildings. Each building has several windows facing the courtyard and the viewer through this window learns much of the occupants. Each of these occupants seemingly represents an aspect of the human condition. Also apart of this movies greatness is the casting. The main character is cast very well and is very convincing. In the movie the viewer finds them self feeling as if they are the main character and becomes extremely connected to him. Also very well cast is the girl friend of the main character. The viewer gets very distinct impressions of her that change as the movie continues. The sound in this movie is very unique because there is very little music and sounds that are out of place. Though this movie is considered to be a classic Hitchcock film the lack of unexplained music makes it stick out from his other movies such as Psycho which is full of it.",Null,1,3,27 February 2004
The Godfather," work a genous
","The God Father Part One is named by this web site to be the greatest movie of all time and for good reason. This movie is a tale of mobsters but as the movie goes on the viewer begins to relate to the mobsters. This movie is a feet of writing, directing, and filming. Music set to this movie fits perfectly to each scene and sets the mood for that scene. This movie has nothing to do with most people's real life instead it has to do with their dreams of wealth and power and is a great movie for any one who has ever dreamed of wealth. 	The main character in this movie evolves from one who is dead set against becoming a member of the family to the head of the family this transition is the focus of the story and is told and shown very well.",Null,0,2,8 June 2004
