Howl's Moving Castle," Wonderful surprising film!
","Whenever someone mentions Howl's moving castle in my circle of friends, everyone's reply is 'Oh! I love Howl's Moving Castle!' So when my friend lent it to me to watch recently my thoughts were there is no way it can be that good right? Turns out i was wrong.Howl's Moving Castle is a wonderful film. I was captured from the moment i started watching. My friend had warned me it wasn't hugely plot driven and it's not but it makes up for it in so many other ways. The music is wonderful. The characters are just brilliant and I think the English dubbed version is excellently cast. It just took me completely by surprise but I am so glad that my friend has introduced me to it.This was my first venture into anime movies and I think it is the perfect starting place for anyone who wishes to try this genre. I will definitely be looking to see if I can find anymore from this genre. I've already been given a few suggestions, Spirited Away, Ponyo. And i will definitely be asking my friend for more suggestions. Excellent film, just wonderful. Highly recommend to anyone!",10,0,2,28 September 2015
