The Avengers," a better name would be Average Assemble
","This film is one of the most distinctly average film I have seen in a number of years. The action and comedy, good as it was, was there to simply gloss over a basic strong line. Normally I like my simple action films, but Avengers just lacked a little something.*spoilers* What I Liked. - The comedy throughout the film was pretty good, myself and the audience laughed throughout. - The opening, might have gone on a little too long, but it did well to set up the film. - Action sequences, apart from the end which I will go into further details next.What I Didn't Like - Story should have been better, a bit more depth was needed in the whole story and characters. Bruce Banner (Hulk) was reluctant to join the mission, but there was nothing that really showed it effecting him - Last action sequence lacked magic, I never felt myself really caring about the Avengers or what happened. Also the end when Iron Man was hurt, all Hulk had to do was make him jump. I felt Thor shocking him again would have been better.It is a decent film for a Sunday evening, but as an actual spectacle it was a small let down.",6,2,18,8 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Good...but not great
","DKR is a solid end to what is a brilliant trilogy. Saying that though, I do feel that this film is the weakest out of the 3. Maybe Dark Knight set the bar too high for DKR.Dark Knight rises didn't have the pace set by its predecessor neither did it have the 'epic' build up to the climax as the others had. However, in it's favour you see more rounded characters, you explore characters like Alfred and Gordon more which gives this film more heart than the other. Also Tom Hardy gave a good performance (seeing as half his face is covered) as Bane, Anne Hathaway was an inspired choice as Catwoman, and the previous cast kept up with the standard they set in previous films.Overall, it is a solid end to series, but it does fall 'flat' in places and doesn't carry the same menace that Dark Knight had. Like I said, good, but not great.",6,3,8,18 August 2012
