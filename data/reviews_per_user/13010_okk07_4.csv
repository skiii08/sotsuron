Vertigo," Sad story
","Firstm, I felt that Mr. Hitchcock drew the film as a male-dominant. I felt this when Scottie told Judy to change her appearance as Madeleine. He didn't love her as Judy. I felt this was not to admit the existence of Judy. I was sad because I think we want people to admit and love myself. Next, I thought that Scottie was brainwashed by Govin Elster. When Scottie was told things of Madeleine, he saw Judy as Madeleine. Also, he loved Judy as Madeleine. Then I thought that people can't reconsider things if we regard something as particular things once. As a result, Scottie and we thought Madeleine committed suicide. After I finished showing the film, I felt that deceit didn't well. First, Judy change her appearance as Madeleine and loved Judy. As a result, at first, Judy didn't love Scottie as herself, and Scottie loved Judy as Madeleine. Surely, they are poor because they couldn't understand each other and Judy died. However, I felt they couldn't face each other from the beginning, so they didn't well. Deceit is not good.",8,1,1,10 August 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Moved film
","I was moved by this film very much! I love this film. In this film, there are many songs and these songs express feelings or situation of characters. By this way, I was easy to understand what character is or their situation very much. These songs are fun and attract us. Next, I was moved by Bell. I think that she is pure and an upright woman. I think that she show us importance of honesty. Next, I think that this film expresses the strong of woman because Bell faces adversity with courage. I thought that this point are different from other princesses of Disney film. Because of this, I like this film more than other films of Disney princess. Finally, I think that you should watch this film. Before I watched this film, I thought that a live-action based on anime is difficult. However, this film is great than I thought. Muic and picture are so beautiful! I was moved by this film very much!",10,21,34,10 August 2017
Psycho," Great film
","First, I thought the music of psycho affect our mind deeply. When I saw Psycho, I was into Osycho's world and felt fear as if I was there. I think that if there are no music in this film, I will not be fear. I noticed the importance of music in a film. Second, I thought if Norman's mother killed Marion, his mother may be psycho too. Surely the person who killed Marion was Norman, but Norman was surprised when he saw the corpse of Marion. Also, finally, the Norman's smile that was possessed by his mother gave us fear. Because of that, I thought not only Norman but also his mother was psycho. Third, I thought Norman's name express not only normal but also strong connection with his mother. It is because his mother's name was Norma. The name of Norman resemble Norma very much. Finally, Hitchcock gave us much surprise. First is the scene of love's hotel. Second is the scene that Marion was killed at the first half. Third, the killer was Norman. I enjoyed seeing this film with fear.",8,0,0,9 August 2017
The Birds," surprised film.
","First, When I finished watching the birds, I thought this movie gives us fear very much. For example, this is no music. When I saw Psycho, I noticed the importance of music because I felt fear very much by music. However, There are no music in this film. I thought this technique was novelty.Second, I think Hitchcock's techniques is great. When Madeline was attacked by birds, I believed Madeline was attacked by birds actually, but this was not true. However, We believe this movie's story and go into our heart and soul. Third, I expect this movie appeal the importance to treasure animals equally. Many people think humans are not equal to animal. As a result, some people crucify animals. However, humans are equal to animals actually. Then I thought this movie appealed the importance to treasure animal equally.Finally, I felt frightened since I finished watching The birds. I felt Hitchcock is great again.",7,3,5,9 August 2017
