Skyfall," Watch it for being Skyfall
","23rd flick out of the divine closet and it took one whole day to sink in; there is a great attempt to change the game.....no flashing of gadgetry, no top of line sophistication......there is a deliberate attempt to go back to basics and start the resurrection Film's holding power is good, it's intense in execution but story-line never reaches that zenith it was expected to....and it is predictable too in some sense Daniel Craig is great as Bond, he has played a mortal Bond beautifully....Bond is no longer perfection now, he has his glitches but he rides on, mental strength of an Agent Bond girl could have been better but Berenice is reasonable Javier as Silva has played the villain - he will go down as a benchmark 'M'- Judi Dench dies in the climax and that is the emotional punch this flick contains- an era ends but Bond plays on... A Bond movie with a 1982 touch of a mortal movie---it's a cocktail and it may work :) Casting song with it's graphics is ausum- Adele has put a real soul in it....you can watch the movie only for that All in all, in spite of it's cons...this movie will go down as something...people can hate it, people can go crazy over it, people can say it's garbage, people can absolutely love it: it depends on their relationship and understanding of Bond Don't watch it for being greatest Bond movie ever, don't watch it for being a competitor to Dark Knight; watch it for being Skyfall",8,42,64,3 February 2013
