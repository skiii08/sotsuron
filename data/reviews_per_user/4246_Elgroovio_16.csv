The Legend of Bagger Vance," Not a bad film
","I used to love this film a lot, but with time I have grown less fond of it. Still I regard it as a pretty good film, for a number of reasons.First, it is very well made, and artistically shot with some highly memorable scenes, such as the one where Will Smith first appears out of the dark.Second, it is very well directed, by Robert Redford.Third and finally it has a smashing cast, with Will Smith and Matt Damon carrying it beautifully. Surprisingly, Charlize Theron, who I don't tend to like very much in general, is very good as Damon's love interest. Another surprising thing about this film is that the kid, J. Michael Moncrief, is fantastic in his part as young Hardy Greaves (kid actors, with the exceptions of Rupert Grint and Haley Joel Osment, tend to have very poor acting skills. Yes Daniel Radcliffe, I'm thinking of you). Also, look out for Jack Lemmon's (for some reason uncredited) role as the old Hardy Greaves (it was one of his final roles).'The Legend of Bagger Vance' is a good watch, but it does get a bit monotonous after a while. Still, if you love golf, you're bound to enjoy it. I give a respectable 8/10.",8,31,55,18 September 2004
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Charming
","A nice little film really, which is very enjoyable. The thing that I enjoyed most about this film was its cameos from the likes of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Woody Woodpecker, Droopy and a never ending list. It is always great to hear Mel Blank. Bob Hoskins is on top form too as the hapless detective and Stubby 'Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat' Kaye makes an enjoyable appearance. The only negative comment that I could make of this film is that I am not a great fan of the character Roger Rabbit. But a great performance is made by Christopher Lloyd as an effective, and somewhat frightening on occasion, villain. 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' certainly isn't the best animated film of all time but it is still very much worth seeing. Enjoy! 8/10",8,0,1,12 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Booooooooooooooring
","This is another one of those highly over-popular films like the Lord of the rings trilogy. Of the main cast, the only two actors that I liked were Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp, but the rest, especially the over-pretty girl, all make me cringe. The people that made the film were obviously intending to make a swashbuckling classic, but instead they made a swashbuckling pile of cow diarrhoea. It is insulting in the memory of such real swashbuckling heroes of the cinema, such as Erroll Flynn. If this film had been made in the 1930s it would have been a million times better without a doubt, basically because it would be entirely different. I am going to get murdered by the entire world's population of women for saying this, but Orlando Bloom is nothing but another one of those really annoying pretty-boys, but, to be fair, that is just the opinion of an ugly teenager who has to go into school each week and watch all those bloody pretty-boys snogging whoever they want, while all the girls look at me and in disgust. But in my opinion, being ugly and being well aware of the fact isn't such a bad thing. It makes you wiser. But that has nothing to do with the film that I am reviewing so why the hell am I talking about it? Anyway this film is pointless and overlong and completely pathetic, and I am pretty sure that if pirates knew that this film was going to be made, they would have decided to become regular bank-robbers. 5/10 (I am giving it such a high score for Geoffrey Rush's sake. You rule Geoff.)",5,2,4,28 June 2004
X-Men," Great fun
","Mutants with all sorts of powers like lasers that come out of their eyes and claws that come out of their hands are set loose in this fantastic comic book adaptation. I would normally yawn at this type of film but I actually really enjoyed it. It must have been because I liked the characters; in some films the characters just can't be related to, so it's difficult to enjoy the film. X-men has a fantastic cast too, with Hugh Jackman as a fine Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as a fine Professor X. Halle Berry is adequate as Storm and Ian McKellen is a sufficiently malicious Magneto. It is also worth seeing this film for its climatic action scenes and appealing special effects (look out for Mystique's transformation powers too). All in all I think that Bryan Singer has done a very good job, and has made a very watchable film. Enjoy! 8/10",8,0,0,17 September 2004
"Monsters, Inc."," My favourite comedy
","You've just got to see this film. It will have you bouncing up and down with laughter no matter what age you are. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfect as the two main characters of the film Mike Wasowski and James P. Sullivan and so is the rest of the voice-cast which includes James Coburn; this must have been his last film. 'Monsters, inc.' has great jokes and great lines (Randall (the bad monster): Where's the kid you creatin; Mike: First of all it's cretin. If you're gonna threaten me you might as well do it properly). This film also has a great score written by the fabulous musician Randy Newman, and the film's song 'Wouldn't Have Nothing If I Didn't Have You' won a well deserved Oscar. Hang around for the credits, there are some of the funniest outtakes that you will ever see in your entire life-time. But one of the most interesting things about this film is that it is really unbelievably sweet without being sickly so. Most Disney films are full of sloppy over-sentimentality but this film isn't which shows how little an influence Disney has on Pixar studios. If you want to buy this film on DVD, I strongly suggest that you get the special edition which is made up of two DVDs. It has tons of special features and watching them you will find out that the crew that made this film are really adorable people. If you are feeling miserable, this film will almost surely cheer you up. It is smart without being vulgar which I find very good; people of all ages can watch this film. Films as good as this are very rare so just see it! I drink to the health and long life of Pixar animation studios and the crew behind this film which is undeniably a comedy Classic like 'Some Like It Hot'. See this film and be prepared to experience the time of your life. And remember 'Put that thing back where it came from or so help me'.",10,0,1,19 May 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I HATE THIS!!!
","In my times I have known many an overrated film but never one as overrated as this pile of puke. Audiences around the world cheer as the curly haired Frodo and various other people group together to go to some place to destroy a ring. I mean for God's sake what's the bloody point of it all? I really found the film pretty boring and decidedly pointless. And to make things worse they all have the stupidest names like Gandalf or Gimli or whatever that weird short guy with the stupid axe is called. I cringed at the sites of people either lumbering about yelling 'you shall not pass' or making themselves invisible by putting on a stupid piece of metal. I am going to stop commenting on this film since there are much more interesting things to think about like how far I could throw the piece of my fingernail that just came off. The only good thing I could say about this film is that it is better than 'Moulin Rouge', (at least it didn't have Nicole Kidman in it).",1,4,12,17 June 2004
North by Northwest," Truly, truly great
","I saw this film for the first time quite a while ago, and ever since it remains one of my favorite films. Everything is perfect about it, from Saul Bass's expertly designed credit sequence to the spectacular ending which always has me on the edge of my seat. It is, without a doubt, one of the best spy films ever made along with 'The Thirty-Nine Steps'. This film has the best possible cast that it could have had. Cary Grant is excellent as Roger and James Mason is a great villain. Martin Landau is equally good as Mason's sleazy assistant. There are some wonderful lines too ('I am not going to let them all down by getting myself slightly killed'). The bi-plane scene is just classic and it is filmed fantastically. What more is there to say? 'North by Northwest' is a true classic from a great director; you've done it again Alfie. Enjoy! 10/10",10,0,0,22 October 2004
"I, Robot"," Will Smith carries this highly enjoyable film with ease
","I have always had a lot of appreciation for Will Smith. He demonstrated good comic talent in the TV sitcom 'The Fresh Prince of Belair' and in the film 'Men in Black' but also showed that he knew how to act in films such as 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' and 'Ali'. In 'I, Robot' Smith gives a performance that is not only kick-ass and cynically funny but also somewhat moving as his character Del Spooner recounts how he had desperately tried to avoid the death of a girl in an accident he had had some time before. The special effects are as good as they get these days, and there is also a great cast that includes James Cromwell as Dr. Alfred Lanning, the dead scientist who died of a presumed suicide. Enjoy it! 8/10",8,0,0,18 September 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Lamentably better than the first two
","I went to see this film expecting something along the lines of the first two films, and was surprised to find that this film was very different. Chunks of the story are missed out so the film isn't so attentative to detail as the Chris Columbus ones were. Also, this film is much more 'artistic', if you want to put it that way; the seasons are represented colorfully and that sort of thing. But this isn't a bad thing, on the contrary, this film is pretty entertaining with the adult actors doing a good job, but the kids seriously getting on your nerves. Look out for Lenny Henry as the shrunken head on the Knight bus ('It's gonna be a bumpy ride'). Decidedly worth seeing. Enjoy it! 8/10",8,0,0,8 July 2004
Moulin Rouge!," Rubbish
","This is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. The acting is just plain embarrassing, the singing will make you scream as though you were having a nail hammered into your ear. There is one thing in this film which makes it even worse and that is Nicole Kidman. She drives me nuts what with all her popularity. Her singing drives me mad; better sounds have come from buttocks than from her mouth. And the worst thing is, out of every three films that come out in the cinema, one is almost certain to have Kidman in it. Anyway back to the film, it contains a very nice song called 'Nature Boy', of which a very nice version was made a long time ago by Nat 'King' Cole, but in the film, they have a version of it which is so bad that when I saw the film I had to make a desperate struggle to avoid myself from bursting into tears of pity for Nat 'King' Cole and all the other good artists who recorded the song. So if you've just swallowed a deadly poison, come and see this film, and the poison and everything else that's in your stomach will surely go back the way it came. Have some taste and DON'T SEE THIS FILM!!!",1,1,5,19 May 2004
Shrek 2," Better than the first one
","I was not very impressed by the first 'Shrek' film and was expecting the same sort of sentiments for the second film. But when I saw it (only yesterday as a matter of fact), I was pleasantly surprised to find it was better. As usual, Eddie Murphy is great as Donkey, but the show is completely stolen by Puss in Boots who is brought alive by the voice of Antonio Banderas. John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Rupert Everett and Jenniffer Saunders are among the new cast. There are some great gags and some wonderful spoofs of a number of films, one of the best spoofs being one of 'Mission Impossible'. But this film is no masterpiece; it suffers a bit from the same problems as 'Shrek (1)': after a while it gets boring watching the two ogres farting and burping continuously. Still, it is worth seeing, even just for Puss in Boots. Enjoy. 7/10",7,4,6,9 July 2004
The Legend of 1900," Impressive
","Not a classic, but whoa, some of that piano playing just sweeps you right off your feet. Tim Roth is good as the handsome pianist Nineteenhundred and so is all the the rest of the cast. This cast also includes Clarence Williams III, presumably the grandson of Clarence Williams (the man who wrote the song 'Basin Street Blues' one hell of a classic), as Jelly Roll Morton. This leads me on to one of the most impressive parts of the film where Nineteenhundred and Morton have a match to see who is the best pianist. There is some piano playing in this scene which will leave pianists with there mouths hanging open. Probably the best thing about this film is it's music. There are many rousing themes played throughout the film, especially the love theme played while Nineteenhundred kisses a girl he has fallen in love with, a simple yet very effective theme. Another thing that makes this film very good is the fantastic camera-shots, especially one of Nineteenhundred as he stands halfway across the plank which leads him from the boat to New York, undecided whether or not he should leave the boat and head for world-wide celebrity on land, or stay on the boat and remain unknown to anyone but the passengers. I have got to get myself the soundtrack to this film and you have got to see it somehow. Enjoy!",8,43,56,19 May 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," pretty good
","Before this film came out I was expecting a pile of puke but was pleasantly surprised. This film is very entertaining, what with its all star cast that includes, among others, Alan Rickman, Richard Griffiths (in top form) and even John Cleese. But there is one thing which drives me nuts and that is the actors who play Hermione and Harry. They are anoying and somewhat bad actors (not that I'm saying I could do better, but I probably could. Atleast I would be funny). But the one out of the three main characters who impressed me the most was Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and another thing that drives me mad is the way that everyone criticises his acting. Screw them, you kick-ass Rupert! Anyway this film is really worth seeing, especially if you liked the book (have you heard of it?) Enjoy it!",8,0,1,12 June 2004
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the first one, good!
","I was very pleasantly surprised with the first Harry Potter film, and was was yet again pleasantly surprised to find that this sequel was even better than the first. Richard Griffiths steals the show yet again with his fantastic portrayal of Harry's uncle from hell, and Rupert Grint is equally good as Harry's buddy Ron. But sadly, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson have not improved, but fortunately the rest of the cast is enough to keep this film going. Stunning visual effects reveal themselves before your eyes as the famous trio (though mostly a duet in this film) battle against giant spiders and massive snakes. Allin all a very entertaining film that is very much worth seeing. Enjoy it!",8,0,1,12 June 2004
Shrek," Overrated but not too bad
","I really don't think much of this over-popular computerised film. It is vulgar and unfunny most of the time. But there are enough gags here to keep this film going at a steady and mildly enjoyable pace. Also, Eddie Murphey is in top form as Donkey, Mike Myers provides a passable Scottish accent for Shrek, and Cameron Diaz suits her part too. But if you are looking for good computer animation films then turn to Pixar. A thing which makes me dislike this film more is the fact that at the oscar ceremony a couple of years ago, it beat Pixar's 'Monsters, inc.' for the oscar for best animated film. 'Shrek' isn't awful, but I get a bit bored after a while of watching a grumpy ogre farting and burping his way into the hearts of audiences around the world. 6/10",6,8,13,9 July 2004
Donnie Darko," What's all the fuss all about?
","Everyone kept repeating to me over and over again 'Donnie Darko is great Max, you should see it'. I finally did get to see it and was quite disappointed really. It was basically a horror version of the considerably better James Stewart classic 'Harvey'. The actors in it were good and I did find a few bits interesting, but for a lot of the film I sat staring at the screen saying to myself 'Oi, what's the point of this film'. I didn't understand a thing about the film when I saw it, and had to ask tons of people over and over again. I was told that when I understood the film I would say to myself 'Oh now I get it. That explains everything', but when, after a considerable amount of time, I finally understood the film I found myself saying 'Oh. Is that all?'. It does have a song that is played over the closing credits ('Mad World', it was number one at Christmas) which I admit to finding quite good. But other than these minor good details this film is not much. If you want to watch a good horror film watch 'The Shining' by Stanley Kubrick starring Jack Nicholson (I'm pretty sure you've heard of it). 6/10",6,0,0,27 June 2004
