Walk the Line," The Movie in Black
","That Walk the Line is a showcase for raw-horsepower performances, white-hot music, and a pervading sense of gloom goes without saying. I don't think I've ever watched a music-driven biography that initially so depressed me. I popped the disk back in it's case and felt mentally and physically blue. My God, what a fascinating, talented, multi-faceted waste of an early life! And yet, to paraphrase Paul Harvey, you don't know the rest of the story.It really is the story of Walk the Line, Johnny Cash's trial by fire, his crucible that brought him health and love and admiration in his later life, that gives that later life meaning and sweetness.Now, I know he was deep and a deeply tortured soul, even after he cleaned out and sobered up, but watching the movie gave me an appreciation for the level of wellness he attained in his life after the movie.Bravo to Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon for their careful and dynamic embodiment of Cash and his long love and wife June. By their good works, after I recovered from the hangover of feeling depressed, I began to appreciate that Walk the Line is a memoir, not an autobiography.The rest of the story is not so much a happy one, but a completed one. Walk the Line is a great, great movie--the storm before the calm.",Null,0,1,2 February 2007
Source Code," The Key is in Caring about the Characters
","I don't get why women get all goobery about Jake Gyllenhaal. He's always looked like he needs a shave and a shower. Gyllenhaal plays the main character in Duncan Jones' Source Code, an almost-always well-plotted and coherent alternative-reality thriller. Whether or not his character, a (dead?) US Army helicopter pilot, needs a shave or a shower is ultimately immaterial. Gyllenhaal's Colter Stevens is a man tasked with finding out who is going to set off a nuclear device in Chicago, and he has to do it by repeating an 8 minute segment of time on a doomed commuter train.I'm not going to go into any more detail about the story line simply because I still don't completely understand it. What I do understand is that Director Jones and his screenwriter, Ben Ripley, have created a compelling story of one man's torment as he begins to realize that many, many lives depend on him suffering a fiery death over and over in order to find out how to stop a greater act of mayhem. Although at times the movie devolves into slickery and silliness, Source Code is not insulting to the viewer's intelligence. Don't get me wrong--this is not a deep movie filled with emotional significance, but it is thoughtful and earnest. SC wants you to be intrigued, but being involved will do just fine. I feel a kinship with any movie that has enough IQ and EQ to make me want to rush back to see more when I have to step out to deal with reality. Jake Gyllenhaal might lack a bit of subtlety at times and Michelle Monaghan seems too wholesome and trusting, but the viewer simply can't stop caring about them. Throw in Vera Farmiga as the US Air Force officer who pilots Stevens through his 'passes' on the doomed train, and the viewer has a full set of sympathetic characters. Farmiga's Captain Goodwin is a mix of professional focus and empathy, and there are more than a few instances of her struggling with not revealing to Stevens his true condition.By the end of Source Code, I was unsure and confused of and about certain aspects of the story, but I could forgive the occasional attacks of murkiness for the general feeling of satisfaction. Throw in my acceptance of a regularly unkempt Gyllenhall and there's been a good reason to blow 90+ minutes.",7,0,0,14 January 2016
Deja Vu," Aw, Screw It!
","I've seen a lot of sci-fi lately, some good, some criminally bad. Although Tony Scott's Deja Vu will never be accused of being awful, it's too dumb--on a logical level--to be taken seriously.Yet.This homegrown-terrorist-blows-up-500+-people-and-it's-up-to-Denzel- to-use-time-bending-to-save-the-day-suspenser is so entertaining that, ya just can't get angry with it, right down to the part where somebody shows up at the end of the flick you thought should be dead.I'm not hitting that spoiler alert, period!Time travel movies are, by and large, incoherent and illogical. Nothing new here with Deja Vu, but Washington and Paula Patton and Jim Caviezel and Adam Goldberg are all such comfortable performers that I actually shrugged at one point and got my harumph out of the way. Do not go all Spock on this flick. You'll become an annoying, overly-analytical, barely-literate movie critic with a zillion reviews on IMDb.And we wouldn't want that to happen to anybody!",6,2,4,3 February 2016
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," ET: Hang Up!
","Sometimes you have to write a review that flies in the face of everyone else. I already have a terrible 'Useful' record for my 300+ reviews, so I'm more than ready to annoy my readers by saying that ET is Steven Spielberg's worst movie.The reason I say this is that at no time did I feel genuinely concerned for the health and well-being of the little, Reese's Pieces-gobbling goblin from the planet Zorkon. The movie, in every way, was so wrenchingly and wretchedly cutesy, so us-against-the blue-meanie government, and so predictable, that if it weren't for the fact that I would have caused a big, stinky fight over my being rude, I would have gotten up half-way through the movie and walked.This is just the type of movie that appeals to people like my hippie-dippy sister, big on cutesy and fighting the evil Reagan Administration! I know I have few friends out there in IMDb-land. I like what is considered dark and edgy (remember, my wife still won't forgive me for making her watch Chinatown). I don't like Karo Syrup poured on Wonder Bread, movie-wise. I want something meaty, with gristle and those sharp little bones that jab you in the throat. ET delivers nothing of those, just two hours of sugary goo, with a pack of evil baddies in environment suits, Peter Coyote, and (until the remastered version came out) people trying to ventilate the alien with . . . guns! Then, for the goodies, there's more of the chaotic home-life that worked so well in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but fails here, cuddly kiddies spouting 'penis breath,' No-Nukes t-shirts, that scene with the bicycle, and a overwhelming feeling that Spielberg just decided he was going to go all out to manipulate your emotions.The crowd came out of the theater all glassy and gassy from their two hour feasting on cinematic Reese's Pieces. I came out, feeling like the man-ape in Altered States, looking for something to hunt down and eat, like the extra-terrestrial. Tastes like chicken?",Null,2,7,19 May 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Made of Dumplings
","Dazzling artwork.That's it, folks. It's all you get with Kung Fu Panda, a masterpiece of CGI, but all MSG and mushy dumplings for a story. This is just another one of those computer-generated monstrosities, put out by Disney or Dreamworks, that depends on your lack of ability to distinguish between story and SFX--if the visuals are eye-popping, they figure your brain is going to pop too.I'm no brain trust myself, but a Mr. Bill-level artistry would have worked just as well IF the story had been any good.We we got instead was a weakling of a script trying to support some breathtaking visuals.I had trouble staying awake during the movie. Just writing about Kung Fu Panda makes me want to take a nap, it was that dull.",Null,0,1,31 March 2009
Chinatown," Inspectors71's pick for the best American movie ever made
","I showed Roman Polanski's Chinatown to my wife about ten years ago and she hated it. It wasn't entertainment, and evil wins. With this in mind, Chinatown and all the people involved on and off screen should be forever congratulated for creating, quite possibly, the perfect adult story that isn't entertainment.I have watched this movie two dozen or more times and I cannot find a flaw in its construction, plotting, artistry, or performance. On top of its perfection, the viewer must appreciate what Candace Bergen once pointed out on an AFI presentation of the top 100 films of all time, that the movie is utterly daring and fearless. The whole idea that a major American film studio would tell the (fictionalized?) story of how LA got big is amazing in itself.Yet, it isn't entertainment, and evil wins.Polanski's creation, his dark image of Depression-era Los Angeles, governed by the thoroughly-corrupted and populated by near-virtuous, real people is so beautiful in its execution, its performances (where do I start with my kudos?--Nicholson, Dunaway, Huston?), and its daring that my praise may turn off prospective viewers--it's some old movie about a private eye, water rights, and incest.Yuck. Who wants to watch that? But if you crave more than entertainment, can stand it when the good guys can only hobble off the field of battle with nothing to show for their bravery but their dignity, and want your time in front of the DVD player to mean something, then accept that Chinatown will deliver to you a meaningful two hours, an appreciation of how good a movie can be.A masterpiece.",Null,1,5,18 March 2006
Erin Brockovich," Made All the Better by Disliking Julia Roberts
","You've seen this story before, but Steven Soderbergh pumps real life into Erin Brochovich, a movie on the verge of really breaking ground. What makes EB so worth watching is the sheer passion and cinematic ingenuity that shows up in performances, editing, camera-work, and pacing.Soderbergh finds a great middle-ground for his characters, especially Brochovich, played by Julia Roberts, an actress I've never really liked, but liked a lot here. Roberts is so angry and skanky that you're almost unwilling to become emotionally invested in her. She is terribly damaged and hardened, unwilling to cut anyone around her much slack. Her behavior, from the incessant cursing to the whorish wardrobe, is offensive enough that her character has to earn your respect first. I really liked that, not being immediately sympathetic.The story itself is not so much unimportant as is secondary (I know it was based on a true story, but bear with me on this) to the real power of the movie. Watching Soderbergh manipulate the physical aspects of film and sound and elicit great, flesh-and-blood performances from actors and actresses made this movie for me. I know I'm describing a heartless, policy-wonk movie, but I don't mean to.Erin Brochovich is 180 degrees off heartless. I'm just impressed with how a tried-and-true story can be retold so effectively.My wife loved it for the getting back at Pacific Gas and Electric and Brochovich growing into and relishing her success with the role of a respected, crusading mom who doesn't give a damn about social and fashion conventions. I appreciated those things, but it was the artistry of the tale-telling that kept me watching.If you combine the two, you've got a helluva good movie. Erin Brochovich has been out for seven years, but if you haven't seen it, I'd strongly recommend being dazzled by it.",Null,0,1,2 April 2007
The Big Lebowski," 'Obviously, You Don't Golf.'
","The Coen Brothers have brought me a great deal of joy, especially when I saw Raising Arizona, alone and far away from home in southern California many years ago. They do have the ability to bring me to full-bore, gagging on my own spit laughter. This is what happened one night eight years ago when I saw The Big Lebowski.TBL is quite simply one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It is also a very strange movie with a story line that indicates sustained drug use and an arrested level of maturity. It is not for everyone.But for me, this movie caught me in the right mood and at the right time. I needed excellent performances, sharp, loony writing, and a soundtrack so eclectic it defies description.There are throwaway lines in The Big Lebowski that come close to--and sometimes match--the signature gags from Raising Arizona (my favorite there was Trey Wilson's exasperated description of his missing son's clothing to an FBI agent, 'I don't know (what he had on)--he had Yoda's and s___ on him!' Here, when Jeff Bridges is offered oral sex by Tara Reid for $1,000, and he starts to move away from the camera, someone asks him where he's going. His response, 'I'm going to look for a cash machine.' I'm dumb enough that lines like that and movies like The Big Lebowski catch me by surprise.And cause me to start hacking spit from laughing.",Null,1,2,25 January 2007
Citizen Kane," Thanks to my film communication teacher
","I had the pleasure of seeing CK in a humanities class I took at Spokane Falls Community College in 1976. Mary Hyatt taught the class and the quality of her teaching was very high. She walked her class through the depth and breadth of this groundbreaking film's history and technology. I have always been grateful for her teaching us about what made Citizen Kane such an important film; I learned to appreciate movies as a serious art form from this class.I also got two other things from it--the enjoyment of watching all the jock morons bail when they realized that this class was going to require . . . writing! and the steady supply of whoopee from the girl sitting right next to me.Gawd, I love movies!",Null,0,1,4 March 2005
The 13th Warrior," A Restrained and Non-Mystical Retelling of Beowulf
","I've been teaching Beowulf off and on for years and, generally speaking, seniors enjoy the good versus evil, blood-bathed poetic tribute to courage and virtue. I've been told again and again to see The 13th Warrior, and I finally did it this weekend. I was more than pleasantly surprised!This is a nicely restrained retelling of the story, with Grendel gone, replaced by a tribe of horrific stone-aged warriors bent on destroying Hrothgar's peaceful kingdom. There is only implied mysticism here; no sign of a dragon, but men masquerading as monsters. The tension is built by John McTiernan's carefully cultivating the viewers concern for and affection for the warriors and their tribal brethren (and Antonio Banderas as an educated, imperfect Arab tagalong).Sure, there's gore--skulls are pierced, heads are detached, and chests are ripped open--but at no time did I think, 'Enough already!' McTiernan ably mixes bits of The Hunt for Red October, Quest for Fire, and Die Hard into his telling of mortal men fulfilling their noble obligation to protect the weak against an enemy that oozes savage barbarism.My only two complaints are as follows: The sound recording of dialogue is infuriatingly muddled (I will have to watch the film again to pick up all the lost dialogue; the link between the characters and their names is not cemented in the viewer's mind because of the lack of sound quality) and I wish McTiernan had given the two female leads more to do (Hrothgar's queen, Diana Venora and the Swedish actress who treats Banderas' wounds--zowie!--are almost used enough, but not quite).Now, my next step will be to read Michael Crichton's book The Eaters of the Dead on which the film was based. I have been a fan of Crichton since I read The Andromeda Strain in 7th grade. Maybe that's the way I can pick up what I missed from the Scandanavian mumbling in the film.",Null,0,1,24 October 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Aaar-gh!
","One of the drawbacks to seeing a big movie, an immensely popular film from a few years back is that you enter into it with such preconceived notions that the flick will be . . . good? I saw Pirates of the Caribbean over the weekend and it was just so much fuss and feathers, a gory, tedious mess. Since you already know the story, I'll tell you why POTC stunk (stank? stinked?). I don't think this movie knew exactly what it wanted to be. It could have been a jolly, smartassed romp or an exciting and suspenseful thriller or a story of love and devotion. Since it tried for all three, it missed.The female lead (something Knightley?) was bland, the Orlando Bloom character was also a nothing, the baddies weren't even there unless the moon was out, and Johnny Depp left me totally confused. His simpering, effeminate Jack Sparrow spent the movie lurching and reeling as if Depp wanted to impress you with his Foster Brook's impression.I wasn't.Needless to say, if anyone reads this review, I'll be earning my one zillionth 'unhelpful' vote on IMDb. I don't write that I don't like movies to get people to react negatively but to get them to ponder whether or not what they liked was actually good or just popular.Pirates was staggeringly popular . . .and awful!",Null,4,7,16 January 2007
Madagascar," No more, no less
","Madagascar works despite its flaw, a strangely incomplete plot that leaves the viewer hanging, wanting more, but not getting it. Yet, as a whole, you would probably have to be three kinds of curmudgeon not to get a decent set of giggles--and at least a view belly laughs--from the nicely animated story of a zebra in a New York zoo that aspires to live in the wild, and the resultant chaos of his friends' attempts to save him from himself.The movie never goes overboard (if you haven't seen it, you'll hate me for that). There isn't too much of anything--dung jokes and psychobabble come to mind. It's from Dreamworks, not Disney, so you won't find somebody intoning the ubiquitous 'Follow your heart!' Madagascar is clipped and fast, funny and gentle, except for the predatory nature of the zebra's closest friend, a lion that winds up in the wild--and there are no zoo workers to toss him steaks anymore.But for the fact that the middle section of the film isn't fully developed (and the movie makers try to alleviate the truncated feeling by throwing in a hilarious short with four very silly penguins), I'd recommend this computer-animated kiddie show to adults because, even if you aren't in the mood for several giggles and a smattering more, watching the family laugh is worth the rental price.",Null,0,1,30 December 2005
Ted," Inside Joke
","Until Ted collapses at the end, with a generic ETish tragedy-turned-victory jerking of tears, I was laughing, sometimes so hard I regretted eating at Taco Time. Yet, since I have only seen two or three episodes of Family Guy, and I'm enjoying the maturity of my mid-fifties, I got the distinct feeling that there was an inside joke in Ted, or my age precluded me from seeing the movie as an joke to be appreciated by younger folks.Anyway/either way, the movie is crude and stupid and pretty darned delightful, with Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, and Seth McFarlane having a grand old time on screen. I saw Ted with my wife, and I must be getting old because there were times I was so embarrassed from the crude humor I actually apologized to her. Then I saw her laughing hard, too, and I knew I didn't have to apologize. Maybe that's what makes Ted work--it's unapologetic in its crudity, its attention to its demographic. I saw The Rocky Horror Picture Show back in the early 80s, and I didn't get the cultish devotion that the movie generated. I did recognize that I couldn't recognize what was going on then. I do recognize that Ted's audience is about 30 years younger than me.Luckily, I'm smart enough to see what I know I'm not seeing.That's why I recommend this hilarious vulgarity.",Null,0,1,6 March 2014
Home Alone," Child Abuse
","This megahit that made Macaulay Culkin a household name--and still causes me to wince when I'm in the presence of gallon paint cans--is a tightly plotted and very funny tribute to upper middle class child abuse. Chris Columbus helms this ruthlessly crafty comedy, and from the moment the house lights go down, it's pedal to the metal.What makes this movie ultimately work is the room-temperature-IQ criminals Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. They're so good you stop listening to the little voice in your head that keeps saying that Culkin's character, Kevin, is the victim of child abuse and neglect.If you don't stop listening to that voice, you'll probably leave the movie with a damp face from laughing so hard and a sour taste in your mouth.Home Alone is a giant, cruel joke. But it is funny. I'd suggest some mouth wash as the end credits are rolling.",Null,1,2,21 December 2005
Alien," This Ain't ET
","Two comments stand out about Alien in the review from Newsweek in 1979: One, that Alien reminds us that not all extraterrestrials are cute, as in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Second, that the movie is nothing more than a scifi haunted house story. The reviewer was really impressed by Ridley Scott's terrifying and claustrophobic telling of a very unwelcome guest on a deep-space version of the Edmund Fitzgerald.Anyone who appreciates the craft of film making should too.I don't think anyone really anticipated that the Alien, chest-popping, acid-dripping, chrome-toothed, eggplant-from-Hell answer to the little guys with the big heads in CEOTTK would become so ingrained in our national pop-culture. You can do a sock-head impression with your hand, have it pop out of some sort of surface, do a periscope swivel while you emit some sort of high-pitched shriek, and then have your hand scurry off . . . and everyone gets it! At the same time, anyone who has to sit by the fat, sweaty guy on the Southwest Airlines flight can do a Sigourney Weaver impression, when she gets face-to-face with Eggplant Boy.Alien scared the pasta sauce out of me, sitting there in the UA Cinemas in the Spokane Valley, 28 years ago. Cripes, it was uncomfortable. What was even weirder is that, without the theatre's intention, the climate of the place matched the cold dampness of some of the Nostromo's interiors. It was hot out and the A/C in the theatre was doing double-time and a half while the critter picked off one member of the crew after another.Which brings us to the ending, the infamous cat-saving scene and Sigourney in ribcage-length tee and panties. Stephen King, in a review of the best movies of 1979 in (I think) Crawdaddy Magazine, said that hyper-feminists and male chauvinists both groaned when Weaver's character, Ellen Ripley leaves herself wide open to attack when she saves the Nostromo's house cat. The Feminazis snarled that Ripley betrayed femalehood by doing something girlish, and the pigs in the audience, while drooling over Weaver, bra-less, and with buff buttocks clearly defined in her undies, snickered at Ripley's being just like a woman, stopping to save a stupid cat.King disagreed with both of them. He pointed out that it was Ripley's ingrained humanity that caused her to do what all the armchair commandos were complaining about. We'd respect her less if she didn't do what a compassionate person would do.I liked King's thinking, here. Sigourney Weaver became a star by portraying a woman with power who uses her intellect and strength to stay alive on the Nostromo. If she hadn't been compassionate, she would have been nothing more than a Terminatrix. Even the little bits of cotton stretched over boobs and butt made her seem more human, a more sympathetic character.Well, I've thought this thing too hard. I recommend Alien for the three things all great action movies need to entertain: Empathetic characters, believable situations, and a great, great bad guy.The Buick fangs and acidic blood are gravy on the mashed potatoes!",Null,0,1,13 April 2007
The Town," Kiss of Death
","I can't remember the guy's name, a radio commentator who is generally conservative, but more ferocious in his humor and delivery than a Limbaugh or a Hannity. Geez, I wish I could pull up his name. He was talking on air about how it's irrational to discount a performer's work if one finds his personal life and opinions offensive. Ben Affleck is a flaming liberal. If he makes great movies, why would you say you hated his movies because you hate his public leftist dribbling. That was the commentator's point, and he was, in fact, talking about Affleck.I think Ben Affleck is over-rated as an actor, but has a pretty good handle on directing a movie. That's cool. If he ever crashes and burns as an actor, he's got a backup plan.Now, to bring this around to his The Town, an entertaining but predictable crime drama, set in Charlestown in Boston, and populated with characters you've seen before in other flicks--Kiss of Death (1947) and it's 1995 remake come to mind. Affleck has crafted a serviceable robbery crew/FBI/love story story. Nothing stood out except or two items of interest:Jeremy Renner was one item. He breathes some life into an ordinary character (the violent friend of the protagonist). The car chase at the start of The Town is so claustrophobic, with cops and crew careening down the narrowest streets this side of, say, Italy. I was actually dodging and weaving as the cars slammed and screeched down one street and onto another road.There are lots of actors and actresses here who are so good, so comfortable in their respective roles. Affleck is the weary robber; Renner, his friend who believes that Affleck will always owe him for taking a fall for him; Rebecca Hall as the frail love interest who Affleck wants and Renner wants dead; Jon Hamm is the predictably vicious fed who went to the Richard Jordan School of How to Play a Repulsive Fed.Did you get the reference to a better Boston crime drama? The Friends of Eddie Coyle.Which The Town isn't. It does hold it's own, delivering a satisfaction that lots of crime dramas can't or won't. I wasn't so much impressed with the movie as I was pleased that the 125 minutes I invested in Affleck's movie were not wasted.Which brings me back to Affleck on screen, behind the camera, and making political poopoo in his occasional interview. So what if he's a dope in real life? His work works. If I had my way, Jane Fonda would be rotting in Supermax for treason, but her performance in 1971's Klute was brilliant.What's a movie-lover to do?Oh, I got the name, I think!

The Devil Wears Prada," Anne Hathaway Keeps Her Shirt On Through the Entire Movie!
","Apparently Anne Hathaway has made her bones by making Disney a small fortune, done a couple of edgy flicks wherein she bares her ample bosom (and gets fired by Disney), and has finally arrived with The Devil Wears Prada, a chic-flick powered by two good performances, those of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci.I don't understand the buzz about this movie--and you have to take that statement from a 48-year-old man living in a very red state with a grain of sea salt--but I know it's very popular. There's a whole lotta cliché-in' going on in TDWP, but Hathaway is an appealing and charismatic young woman who holds her own against Meryl Streep, doing the high-fashion diva act without breaking a sweat.Streep is crisp and professional, so easily hate-able that you might miss two things she does that distinguish her performance. When Hathaway, new to the fashion industry, snickers at the imperceptible differences between a pair of blue belts, Streep verbally carves her up like a Christmas goose, and puts in a little bit about how Hathaway doesn't appreciate the thousands of jobs, the working-class paychecks the fashionistas create.Later, when Streep is facing her umpteenth divorce, she appears rough, raw, without makeup, tearful and puffy. You expect her to reveal more, to let the audience see behind her armor, an actual human underneath the diva. But after a few unguarded moments with Hathaway looking helplessly on, she slips back into Imperious Bitch Mode.She saves the scene from becoming maudlin by putting her armor back on. It's almost a dutiful suiting up, as if, if she didn't, she'd be betraying her obligation to kick the competition's collective ass.It's as close to human as she gets until you see her in a tight close-up at the end of the film, when you understand that she knows who and what she is in the grand scheme.Hathaway doesn't get to be that subtle. She is a beautiful woman, but her performance plays to Hathaway's strengths, nothing more or less. She gets to cry, laugh, get angry, and look good, but there's no stretch here. Putting pretty clothes on a pretty mannequin is not a big challenge.Which brings us to Stanley Tucci, the wise homosexual who pounds Hathaway into professionalism with tough love. His character is as predictable as any other, but the last thing I saw Tucci in was the 1995 crime drama, Kiss of Death. He was reptilian and ambitious as a district attorney who betrays David Caruso. His balanced performance--neither too masculine or drag queen--is the best work in the movie and it took me twenty minutes to remember where I'd seen this guy before. From my perspective, The Devil Wears Prada is a pleasant, if vacuous time-waster. There's nothing to be too cheerful about and nothing to get mad at. If the buzz sounds appealing, by all means rent it.",Null,1,3,27 March 2007
Forrest Gump," Dropping My Keys
","I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.Forrest states the obvious, 'Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!'And the water-works just started to flow.I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, 'That's why I love you.'Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen. I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, 'Hey, Boo,' the fob goes flying.The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain.

Fargo," Fleeting Humor
","As much as I have affection for Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski, I despise Fargo, as repulsive a movie as I can think of (and only exceeded in pornographic ugliness by No Country for Old Men). Fargo is a nauseating piece of rotten meat, run through a wood-chipper. It's a one-joke blood bath, and that one joke is how supposedly dopey North Dakotans sound. I left this trash feeling utterly dispirited and dirty. I waited for my wife and toddler daughter to get home from work and day care. The feelings went away, but the disgust left a scar.Shame on the Coen brothers.",1,9,19,9 April 2014
Oblivion," So the title is a joke, right?
","Joseph Kosinski's Oblivion (2013) is visually beautiful and almost totally pointless. It's obvious that the story is, thin as it is, a way to blow a lot of CGI dollars and beautiful scenery and give Tom Cruise a chance to show off his manly-man physique. Since I'm not interested in Cruise's musculations, the female leads are equally forgettable (I'm not even motivated to look up their names), and Morgan Freeman is totally wasted, I'm left with remembering bits of scenery, landscapes, colors, textures, and that really cool helicopter-spaceship that Cruise cruises around in, with a bobble- head on the dashboard to make him seem, well, whatever. Not so bland, I guess, or cutesy-human-one-foot-in-our-time.I think the biggest trouble with Oblivion is that fairly early on, we find out something about the aliens, the 'Scavs,' that sucks out all the air from the movie's environment suit. The viewer says, 'Well, hell . . . 'Then when we're supposed to get up in arms over the real baddies, the needle on the giveacrapometer won't budge.So, for the next hour or seven, we're stuck in . . . wait for it . . .waaaiiit . . .

The Italian Job," Where Was I . . .
","for the last 111 minutes? I seem to remember watching The Italian Job, a remake of a heist movie from the late 60s, now set in Los Angeles, and starring a bunch of pleasingly vacant actors and cute little cars. But that's not possible because I have so little memory of it already (last night, was it?). I do recollect having a pleasing sensation of seeing Charlize Theron, bra-less in a tank top, but they make mannequins with nipples, and I was in a clothing store a few days ago. Mark Wahlberg was there, all angry, wounded puppy-dog handsome. Donald Sutherland popped up, then popped out after crossing paths with ferret-faced baddie, Edward Norton. Venice, Italy and Hollywood, California both looked nice. There were millions of dollars in gold bars, some scuba gear, laptops that could do things I don't think can be done even 11 years after the movie came out, a couple of bullet holes, a number of giant Samoans, cusswords looped out with non- cusswords, and a feeling that this was all just so much fun for a bunch of popular actors and their action-movie-addicted audience.Yet, I can't be sure. I think The Italian Job was an equally pleasant and vacant bit of duck fluff for summer consumption. I know Wahlberg has so much animal magnetism that if he screwed a light bulb in his ear, the damn thing would light off instantly. Theron exudes such a dangerously sexy vibe that, even though she has nothing to do here but act as if she's happy to be invited to work with the boys, we don't mind because there's something primal in her provocativeness. Norton could narrate a documentary on Pope Francis, and the viewer might want to clean his ears out with Lysol, all because he's so . . . um . . . icky.I just don't know for sure if I saw this movie. It's gone. It faded away. I'm not disturbed by my confusion, just confused about where the time went.",5,1,3,18 March 2014
Grease," Sewage
","Phoney-baloney movie critics like me know very well that our opinions are usually only important when we torque someone off. Prepare yourself--I'm about to feel important.Grease is a fecal remnant of a movie, a messy, unfunny, glob of excrement masquerading as nostalgia, love story, and musical. For all the reasons the great horde of Grease-lovers love it, I find it revolting. It's pop-culture without the fizz, a high-concept, sanitized inanity based on a rough and raunchy Broadway play. I remember sitting there in the theatre, grimacing and squirming as if a movie had somehow morphed into a hemorrhoid. To add to my discomfort was my idiot sister, sitting beside me and idiot-grinning as if Jesus himself had donned a Fonzie outfit and had begun warbling with Olivia Newton-Magdelene.There is simply nothing I can say about this effluvia other than . . .Grease is the turd.",Null,1,3,1 February 2007
Radio," Inspired by a Bowl of Malto-Meal
","I've gone over my 300+ reviews recently and I must admit that most of them are snotty and negative.This one will fit perfectly in the group.Radio, based on a true story of a cognitively impaired young man who was taken under the wing of a high school football coach--and found his way--is yet another in an endless line of inspirational buckets of goo that Hollywood produces at a rate of one or two per year.There is simply no reason to engage your brain for stuff like this, nor does it make sense to criticize it. All you're going to get is an angry harumph from the audience members who suck this stuff up like cotton candy.I watched Radio last summer while recovering from a heart surgery thingy and when my wife asked me if I liked it, and I paused for too long, she made some comment about how the cardiologist should have put a heart in my chest first.See what happens?",Null,0,4,10 March 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Hitting the Pavement
","I'm guessing that I've started to revert to a concrete-operational level. Or I just don't like the ick that passes for art.Little Miss Sunshine is just that, icky. There's a good message involved in this flick--'Losers are those folks too afraid to try.' Yet, by the end of the film, you've been exposed to some of the more unpleasant characters you're going to see for awhile and you're going to want to shower, repeatedly.I'm so middle class dull that I have trouble putting myself in the position of a viewer who found this film much more than ugly, a story of a highly dysfunctional family on a road trip to put their youngest member, a second grader in a beauty pageant. I find the whole concept of abusing children by making them up like dwarf-hookers nauseating, and that's not the main reason Little Miss Sunshine gave me the creeps.Am I missing something here? Should I put my Middle America, Red State sensibilities aside and embrace LMS as . . . art? You figure it.I'm going to revel in my provincialism by watching something bourgeois and leave the Indie, cutting edge stuff to the folks in the Blue States.",Null,4,9,5 February 2007
U-571," U-Gotta Problem?
","Sure, it's inaccurate. Yup, it's a British story grafted onto the US Navy. Gotcha, Jon Bon Jovi can't act. Yes, black sailors were second-class citizens.We get it. So shut your trap!And enjoy Jonathan Mostow's U-571, a fanciful story of the USN trying to steal an 'Enigma' machine from the Nazis so that the Allies could read the Krauts' mail. It's all very derring-do and gung-ho and 'You're an officer; you always have the answer!' leadership tutorial. And I loved just about every minute of it.I like daring, gung-ho, and dammit, when you're confronted with a problem you don't know how to solve and the boys are dependin' on you, you punt!U-571 is a movie that would fit nicely into WWII because the Yanks are plucky and tough, and the Germans are rotten to the core. When it's over and the credits are done, you almost expect a graphic that tells the audience to buy War Bonds in the lobby of the theatre.",7,5,11,4 May 2016
"I, Robot"," Kick Your ATM
","That's where you got the cash to see this idiocy in the theater, right? I didn't pay for I, Robot; I saw it for free, clipped and snipped to fit into two hours, and thank God for small favors. The less I, Robot, the better.Wow, what they can do with CGI! Special effects wizards can fill the big or little screen with dazzling images (in this case, beautifully emoting machines and a bright, cheery, sun-washed Chicago of the future), but I, Robot can be summed up in three phrases: 1. Will Smith's torso 2. Very little story 3. Not a damned thing in sight to make this story memorable I wasn't even frustrated by the movie; I expected eye-candy and I got it.Which brings to mind Stanley Kubrick's film of Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, a story of the continuing evolution of man, past the human body and its confines. Remember when Mission Control informs Dave Bowman that there was nothing wrong with the communications unit that HAL-9000 said had failed? The camera holds on the red eye of HAL for what seems like five seconds, then cuts back to Keir Dullea, masking his appalled horror that the most important piece of equipment on the Discovery has failed. HAL, in that five seconds, proves that he is a thinking, sentient being by deciding to kill the crew, right then and there.It is a dazzlingly human moment, when a machine decides it must kill to survive. And Kubrick reinforces this evolution of HAL to human by showing you the similarity between HAL's 'eye' and those of the mission commander. Blank, masked, and deadly.2001 was based on a great piece of literature. So was Isacc Asimov's I, Robot, but you would never know it from the later. I, Robot is as close to perfection in pop CGI junk. Twenty years from now, people will still be talking about Kubrick's masterpiece.And you'll be able on to catch the quaint I, Robot on the late, late show on your ether-vision projection.",Null,0,1,19 May 2008

Possibly, that's all I need to say about this vulgar slurry of bathroom humor that made me laugh until I had to huff a couple shots off my inhaler.Suffice it to say, this is the sort of movie that appeals to those who review film with one of two words--'Sweet' or 'Sucks.' I wanted to see it because some of my students, the ones with an IQ above room temperature were saying it really was funny after all! I watched it and laughed myself silly.

The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Vomitorium
","If, mind you, if you can sit through the first 100 minutes or so of this gag-fest (and I stress the word 'gag'), there is a nice performance by Catherine Keener, the real and legitimate girl friend of The 40 Year Old Virgin. She is a lovely and mature actress who injects the only humanity in this mindless, sophomoric garbage. Keener's character Trish falls for Steve Carell (Andy), as timid a man as you're likely to ever see in a movie. There is a budding and emotionally almost-sorta-kinda believable romance that grows between them. It's worth watching, all five to ten minutes of it.But you have to wade through what seems like an eternity of filth and degradation to get to it.I must be getting old; I just sat there chuckling every once in awhile, but mostly cringing and blushing. The 40 Year Old Virgin isn't worth your time, even if you're a Keener fan.Flush this commode . . . and check something out in the grownups section of the video store.",Null,1,3,22 February 2007
54," Disco Suckage Field
","Probably the only thing I can say about 54, the sort-of disco biopic of Steve Rubell and his famous club, is that it's all so inconsequential. There isn't really anything to recommend here, not even Mike Myer's Fran Drescheresque performance. It took about three minutes for me not to care.And I was a teenager during the disco era. I hated the stuff--brainless, artless nonsense. With no discernible talent required to compose disco, there was no reason to take any of it seriously. An incoherent narrative, dreadful dialogue, and a whole undercurrent of stupefying stupidity (the heart and soul of disco), don't combine for anything other than a garbage movie about pathetic people living in the unreal world of the late 1970s disco scene.Have at it.",Null,1,2,29 November 2010
American History X," My Professor
","I had a professor at Eastern Washington University who liked to say outrageous things to get us thinking in our teacher-preparation classes. He told us that all stereotypes are born from some tiny kernel of truth, that right or wrong, stereotypes are born from some sort of relative reality.So don't be offended by what I have to say. I found the hatred and the violence in Tony Kaye's American History X horrifying and dispiriting, the stuff that makes me look, from time to time, at the human race and think 'pestilence.' Yet, there's just a smidgen of truth in Edward Norton's pep talk to his skinhead followers just before they destroy a grocery store owned and operated by a Korean. There's a nugget of reality in Elliot Gould's attempt at understanding the violence of the 1992 LA riots. Mistreatment garners hate--and a desire for revenge! A government that doesn't enforce what Michael Savage hammers at--language, borders, culture--ceases to serve its constituency. Given the reasons--lame or not--to wage war against our neighbors, we are predisposed to do so.That's why I think American History X is a great film. It could never be considered by anyone with a shred of maturity as entertainment. It does accomplish one of the critical Six Parts of Drama, penned by Aristotle--it evokes intense thought.I've had a copy of AHX in my stack-of-movies-to-watch for about a decade, thanks to my video store in-laws who used to give us screeners, and I finally sat down to watch the movie. My preconception was that X was some sort of hoary drive-by gang movie. I really didn't know what to expect, beyond the positive comments by students over the years. I was engrossed by the film, its performances, and its clear and tragic narrative from the start.Which brings me back to my professor from a quarter century ago at EWU. I liked the guy, the way he was able to tweak our politically correct sensibilities and to get us talking. American History X has that same ability.He and the movie were wise. Hopefully anyone who sees the movie shares in that wisdom.",Null,0,3,15 March 2010
Duck You Sucker," A Fistful of Idiocy
","Junk.Sergio Leone was an acquired taste--his 'Dollar Trilogy' runs the gamut from lean/lyrical to surreal/stupefying. Leone comes a cropper with his elephantine 'A Fistful of Dynamite,' a low-brid combination of political revolution, infantile plotting, and dreadful performances.Although 'Duck You Sucker' (the alternate title) tries to be a message film, all we get is incoherence, with buckets of blood and one of the weirder musical scores I've heard. Rod Steiger and James Coburn are trapped in bad make-up and/or bad accents as they slaughter and butcher and incinerate roughly a third of the Mexican Army in the 1910 Revolution. I kept hoping, during what seemed to be a week of movie watching, that some of the old surrealistic, alternate-universe, western magic would appear. All I got for my effort of watching A Fistful of Dynamite was a weak headache, and I felt sad for Sergio Leone because, although he wasn't a great director, he had a knack for big storytelling.And that knack wasn't apparent in this incomprehensible and artsy- fartsy bloodbath.",3,8,17,19 April 2016
Enchanted," My Wife Still Doesn't Get It
","She looks at my movie collection and says, 'You like weird stuff.' Yet, I sat down a few days ago and watched Disney's Enchanted and just, flat-out loved it. It was a bright, funny, cheerful, and dead-on fantasy/tribute that makes us appreciate the best Disney has done through its history. I was laughing and cheering and my wife, who has had to sit through Chinatown and Dr. Strangelove and Blazing Saddles, just looked at me as if I had lost my mind.Enchanted is that good, that a lover of the dark in movies can be purely entertained by it. And it isn't just because Amy Adams is lovely and luscious . . . you pigs out there! Sometimes you sit down and watch a 'family movie' and you wonder who you angered in some past life. I've seen a lot of trash masquerading as family entertainment over the last dozen years (since the kid showed up). Enchanted isn't a masquerade.

The Dirty Dozen," The Quintessential Guy Movie
","49 years after its release, you can still ask, 'Have you seen The Dirty Dozen,' and the look of bloodlust and delight on the other person's face will tell you everything you need to know. TDD is one of those flicks that got released in VHS way back when, and got shown on superstations about once a week, and the end result is like Andrew McLagen's John Wayner, Chisum. It seems as if everybody--of the guy persuasion--has seen this great, great Robert Aldrich movie.It's so ugly and perverse and the very thought of the good guys herding Nazis and their women into the basement of a château in order to drop grenades down the ventilators and then incinerate them is enough to make anyone who is seeing it for the first time let out an OMG (or something a bit more masculine). The Dirty Dozen is one of the most tightly constructed, bone-crunching, knife-slashing, burp-gun blazing alternative-to-your-average-war-movie movies I've ever seen. And it came out before the rating system, so parents who showed up with their little 'uns were probably thinking, 'OMG!' This is the pure tough-guy movie. The convicts are rapists and murderers, their commander (Lee Marvin) is an insubordinate malcontent, and it takes almost no time for Aldrich to start converting you into big fans of the rapists, murderers, and malcontents. The message is simple--War is a crime, so why not use criminals?But the viewers, for the most part, never get to that deep-think; instead, they just groove to the turning of convicts into what they were supposed to be, soldiers.And there's that scene that makes everyone in the audience who has ever wanted to witch-slap his boss laugh out loud, when Marvin stops prissy General Robert Ryan from dry-shaving John Cassavetes by firing a burst from his machine gun as a final/only warning. Take that, authority!Come to think of it, this is the sort of story that teenagers probably loved. It's anti-army army, beat-the-Nazis-by-flippin-off- the-man, pure sixties manly-man rebelliousness.Just writing about this movie makes me want to eat a big-ass burger, lots of onion, and walk it through a warm room, sweetheart!Forget Cialis, boys.

Suffice it to say that, by the ending credits, you're going to have seen some seriously intense Montana history, watched the principals age better than mere mortals could ever hope to (except ol' Colonel Anthony Hopkins who has a stroke and winds up looking as if he got a shot of Novocaine in his face every morning in the makeup trailer), listened to some major mastication of all that pretty scenery, and probably wondered why your US History class in high school couldn't have been this melodramatic--and R-rated for seriousness, with the occasional foul word, spilled gut, and breast or butt showing.The gals might want to stock up on Kleenex.

The Coens' No Country for Old Men steps beyond the pornographic in vicious repugnance and plunks down with a bloody thud in downtown evil. Why would anyone feel a need to tell a story like this, and in such a way as to leave viewers filled with such contrived despair? I use the word contrived because I'm assuming the average Joe or Jane sitting down to watch an action/chase movie by the Coens is not expecting to leave the theater or living room filled with despair and feeling degraded. Somebody--or in this case, some bodies--had to contrive/spawn/shat a situation where the sum of the optimistic parts of the audience has been diminished after exposure to 122 minutes of this villainous garbage.

District 9," Hard-Core Thingies
","Seeing District 9 on broadcast TV is a lot like watching the idiotic porn-lite flicks on a movie channel that rhymes with Sinemax. It's embarrassing, but you don't have to see this doodad going into that whatsits, which is the black heart and sick soul of hard-core. The TV version of this science fiction morality play is a blessing because, if you read about all the stuff the Fox Movie Channel cut out for broadcast, you may thank your lucky starships that you didn't see the hard-core original.Yet, unlike the spewtacular Starship Troopers--the first movie that comes to mind that has a nausea-factor off the charts--District 9 has a soul. Read between the lines and you see a thinly-veiled criticism of the disastrous effects of shelving unwanted people into refugee camps. Although the moralistic treatment of the subject of where to put more than a million sick and starved extra-terrestrials who have come to Earth is heavy-handed, it is refreshing to see some thought, some cleverness used in what is essentially a 'bug-hunt' movie. Twelve hours after seeing District 9, my passion for it has cooled. I was impressed by the documentarian treatment of the story of a corporate bureaucrat who is given the task of over-seeing the eviction of the 'Prawns' from their wretched ghetto. Director Neill Blomkamp carefully reveals a multi-leveled story of the bureaucrat, the corporate baddies who would just love to see what makes the aliens' weaponry tick, the hostility of the humans toward these invaders, and the (pardon me) humanity of the Prawns.What cooled my passion is what so often happens to heavily-laden CGI flicks and other bug-hunts--as the story works its way into the third reel, we are forced to watch a horror story turn into a gory rescue-mission shootemup. Even with the editing for television, the bodies start stacking up, the blood and brain chunks start coating the lenses, and the viewer (me) begins, once again, that shutting-down sequence that means my emotional bond with the movie is unraveling.Even though this isn't a Hollywood movie--it's an indie from South Africa--District 9 collapses into just another pool of red and black blood because, I guess, it's expected. Why force the audience to keep thinking all the way through a movie when you can cut to the bullet and ray-gun ridden chase? We all knew it was coming. Why complain?Blomkamp even throws in some Spielbergish tugging of heartstrings by showing the lead alien grieving over his loss of hope, his son, and the discovery of medical experiments being performed on the Prawns. It's a bad sign when a bit of computer flimflammery can show more emotion than most of the humans running around. I swear, if I saw this in a theatre, I would have bet that there would have been somebody--or somebodies-- mewling 'aahhh's' when the camera captures the grief on 'Christopher's' face.In District 9, an attempt to turn the monster-movie on its head by making the aliens very, very human would have worked if the humans making the movie hadn't lowered their bar by saying, 'Sorry folks, you're too dumb to get the social commentary here. Have some brain chunks with your popcorn.'Mmm, tastes like cat food!",6,0,1,12 March 2014
Liar Liar," Two brief moments of true wit
","The trouble with this movie is that, other than Jim Carrey fanatics, sophomores of all ages, and the clinically stupid, there's nothing memorable here, nothing except for two brief moments of true wit and Maura Tierney's loveliness.When Carrey advises his son that making a face will not cause it to 'stay that way, but some people make a good living from it,' I laughed out loud. Also the look of sheer horror on Carrey's face when the judge asks him if he can proceed with the trial is genuinely funny. Finally, although she is completely wasted--a cardboard cutout would have been as effective--Maura Tierney is, as usual, breathtakingly lovely. She isn't eye candy, but simply beautiful, enough so to make this Irishman's breath get short.Sorry, was I gone long?Other than that, there's nothing.

It happened three quarters of the way through the movie, but I am not being critical of Spielberg or JP.The point of this is that I was enveloped in the story of Disney/Pixar's Cars from the moment it started. The artistic and character animation is simply so good that Cars is a comedy and not an animated comedy.The artistry, the color, the sound, and the performances are impeccable and I can't think of even a nit to pick about the film.

The Game," Hey, I'll Give This a Try
","A few weeks ago a former student brought three boxes of VHS tapes to my classroom. She knew I like that format for its sturdiness, and I depend on VCRs to record movies, transferring them to disk if a movie is a keeper.Most of the videos were films I already had or had already seen and didn't want, but I appreciated this young woman's thoughtfulness.With that said, I found David Fincher's The Game, a movie that interested me when it first came out 19 years ago. I've seen so many crappy or mediocre films lately that I was hoping for a gem hidden in the box.And I got one.The best things about this psychological thriller are that, although it often brushes up against the absurd, it never gets saturated with silliness, and Michael Douglas is both infuriating and sympathetic as a heartless and driven money-mover who, after being given a very unusual birthday gift by his ne'er-do-well brother, Sean Penn, finds that the gift keeps on giving. Or taking, in this case.For 128 minutes, I was able to jettison everything else, and become immersed in a story that was both fresh and fun. The Game is tightly plotted and well-acted, and only occasionally gets a bit boggy from aforementioned absurdities. Not enough to fuss about.I thought I might be in for something above average with Douglas' character being confronted with that I-hate-clowns clown in his driveway, followed by being talked to directly by Daniel Schorr on TV. It's a very trippy flick, with enough escapist power, twists and turns, and an understated moral to give an old movie-lover/movie- cynic a good solid entertainment.Fire up the VHS to DVD transfer software!",7,0,0,8 June 2016
Unknown," Getting Past the Premise . . .
","is one of Hollywood's greatest difficulties. The idea, the pitch, the hook, whatever you want to call it is not enough to carry a movie. I got wrapped up in Liam Neeson's character's story very quickly, and I stayed there for a a little while, but I knew the movie was in trouble when I saw January Jones, a woman so cold and calculating, so damaged in Mad Men, that it mars her beauty. If Mrs. Neeson was a baddie, then the mystery would be tainted. I saw at least two other movies retold in Unknown, something with Sean Connery as an Arab peacemaker and Mirage, with Gregory Peck. The Connery flick was junk, but Mirage was great.Unknown will never be confused with greatness. It's just too pat, too slick. I never accepted Liam (I'm going to growl a lot like Nick Nolte) Neeson as a botanist with a trophy wife. The co-inky-dinks were just too much. By the time the back story of Neeson is told, I had intellectually closed my locker. By the third reel, I was thinking/thanking this was free (TNT). I've got Taken on deck. I think I'm maxed out on Liam--I've liked him in so many things that seeing him morph into an action hero is just too much.But, when we get Netflix back someday soon, I'll be ready for more Mad Men, an opportunity to see January Jones again, the luminescent beauty with the Gorgon on the inside.",6,1,2,26 February 2014
Caddyshack," Perfect Summer Fare
","Just a few lines about a great, funny, sunny movie that makes me laugh every single time I see it. I think Harold Ramis' Caddyshack works like a big, joyous block party. You can't help but like every single character, every moment of crude and lewd, right down to Brian Doyle-Murray telling a caddie to 'Pick up that blood!'I think Caddyshack's peer, John Landis' Animal House is a funnier movie because of the chances it takes spearing sacred cows, but Caddyshack may be the smoother-frothier?-film because it avoids lagging at the start of the third reel, something that Landis throws in to build up steam for his big, obnoxious cherry-bomb-in-the- toilet ending.Caddyshack just ambles along, all big-heart and Lacy Underalls.Animal House is, at its core, something serious. There's an edge to the humor and to the end-of-Camelot story. I wrote a long review of AH some years ago. The boys and girls at Faber College ('Knowledge is Good!') are about to smacked upside the head by the hideous specter of Vietnam. It's their last moments of freedom before history arrives unannounced.Both have that feel of reading something hysterically funny in National Lampoon, and danged if it doesn't feel as if everyone is working his or her butt off to come up with a really good, really funny work of renegade art.What I've noticed about Caddyshack is that the power of Bill Murray ad-libbing his way through his duties as an assistant groundskeeper has, for the better part of forty years, provided inspiration for Caddyshackers to twist their mouths into a Joe Walsh mumble and utter the victorious cry, 'It's in the hole!'It's what cultures are built on . . .I think.",9,1,4,31 May 2016

Paranormal Activity," I Prefer Pea Soup
","I sat down with my old friend The Exorcist a few days ago in order to gauge the quality of Paranormal Activity against Billy Freidkin's big ol' vomiting, head-spinning, crucifix-violating, scared-me-half- out-of-my-sphincter-control classic.And.Although I found the characters believable and the semi-ad-libbed dialogue spot-on, I walked away from Paranormal Activity with a feeling of disappointment and disorientation. I so wanted the movie to be good that I found myself rooting for it (the way I watch Donald Trump being interviewed by Bill O'Reilly and I hope that Trump will be less of a bloviating jackass, but it never happens). I felt disoriented because I was tracking every frame of the film for something, anything that would add to the tension. Sure, the movie was tense, somewhat suspenseful, but it never lit off, caught fire, made me want to turn away the way The Exorcist or Signs did. I knew I was in trouble when all I could think about was how blessedly, believably down-to-earthedly wholesomely, curvy-sexy Katie Featherston was. She is such a lovely young woman, with a knack for causing viewers to suspend their disbelief, and I caught myself thinking that, if I were 24, this would be the girl I would want to woo.Her costar, Micah something (notice how I can't remember his name?) is so annoying and self-absorbed, that the action unfolds with the viewer (me) becoming nicely embedded in the story. What is she doing with this jerk, anyway?Then back to 57 year old reality, with my dream-girl wife of 22 years, my 20 year old kid, my bills and responsibilities, my pets and having to fight to keep the wood stove lit, and I realize that the human aspect, the adventures of Katie and Micah, are the only parts of Paranormal Activity that work.Maybe if there had been a bit more of the bump-in-the-hallway stuff to make me want to get up and take a break, I would have enjoyed it more. Finally, PA made me want to go back and rewatch Apollo 18, a movie I panned. I'm thinking there might be something there with those little rocks sprouting legs.

The Adjustment Bureau," I Just Felt My Brain-Cells Move . . .
","and for that I am grateful. So many movies are just plain stupid that when I get a chance to see a sci-fi/fantasy with moral underpinnings, engaging performers, and enough actual thought to allow me to forgive the flabby third reel, I say thank you, Hollywood.Even nasty, perverse, and unpatriotic Hollyweird gets it right occasionally.What I liked about The Adjustment Bureau is that its characters were interesting. I found myself rooting for the good guys and wishing the baddies to just go away. I realized that Matt Damon is really good at what he does, that the chemistry between his character and that of Emily Blunt worked (in a movie sort of way), and that the adjusters were nothing more than practitioners of a Skinnerian form of tough love. More than anything else, this was a fun movie to watch; to allow myself to suspend disbelief and let the flick envelop me was refreshing. When I was through watching it on the SyFy channel, I was glad I put up with the fragmentation grenade of advertisements.Sure, The Adjustment Bureau won't be hailed as a landmark film 20 years from now, but it will, hopefully, sit on a display shelf for future viewers to sample. I found it worth both my time and my investment of emotion and intellect (all seven brain cells), not something I can often say.",Null,2,3,26 February 2014
Singin' in the Rain," The Only Thing Missing is a Couple of Droogs
","I love the title song to Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain. The whole scene, with Gene Kelly joyfully relishing in his love for Debbie Reynolds is a pure and simple delight. Yet, strangely enough, it's Malcolm MacDowell and his Droogs' home invasion, assault, and gang-rape in Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange that gives me a pause when I think of SITR.That and the fact that, after it gets off to a rousing, funny, and witty start, Donen and Gene Kelly's musical comes apart at the seams, with one over-long and self-indulgent song-and-dance number after another, eventually causing the movie to become a tedious mess instead of the tender love story it should have been.With all-due attention given to my musical apostasy, I got half way through Singin' in the Rain and started to squirm and harumph, wondering when this damn thing would be over. I started longing for an episode of Don't Forget the Lyrics--at least that's only an hour! SITR just seems to go on and on, heaping on noisy songs, and it's not until the end that Donen and Kelly bring the original story back to its logical start, that of a talented heel who finds character and fulfillment in a nice girl's arms.Singin' in the Rain is a big, bloviating pain in the butt, with one or two great--really great--bits, and a sore butt for sitting through the rest.",Null,3,8,8 February 2008
Mama," Accepting Responsibility
","My favorite part--or theme--of Andres Muschietti's Mama, a fairly standard screecher with more-than-average emotional weight, is watching Jessica Chastain's character get her hard shell chipped off trying to bond with two little girls who have had a 5-year stint in a cabin in the woods with a 130 year old ghost with the maternal instinct of a female grizzly.As the movie progresses, I found myself falling into an appreciative love with Chastain's Annabel. She's all angry rock bassist tattoos sort of Goth makeup cleavage keep your hands to yourself you piece of crap. And her boyfriend, the girls' uncle, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, isn't much help because Mama decides it would be a hoot to damn-near kill him in a stair-fall, thereby putting the guardianship on Miss Goth. Chastain is so angry about having to care for the kiddies--who brought the ghost with them to a university residence (but didn't sign an insurance waiver!)--but when pushed, she starts to channel a little gristliness herself. I just liked her courage. Even though it's a horror movie, the humanity of Annabel shines through. What was disappointing was the pat ending, the final fight for the lives and souls of the two girls and the inevitable hint of a sequel. What would have made Mama a complete emotional satisfaction would have had Chastain reasoning with and winning over the ghost, a Spanish actor named Javier Botet (no, I'm not getting bogged down in pronouns, so just read on), and convincing her to accept her loss, believe that God will forgive her sins, and let go.I know that would have not been anywhere near as intense as the ending in the film, but it would have said something for the power of forgiveness and reason. Yet, Mama managed to elicit from me what a good scarer should--I had to leave the lights on and cuddle with the chihuahua.'Dude, let me go! I have cat food to eat!'",6,0,0,3 May 2016
Sinister," Nice, Satisfying, and . . .
","Solidly shuddery are words I would use to describe Scott Derrickson's Sinister. I measure the quality of horror flicks against The Exorcist and The Haunting and Signs, among others, and Sinister, although not in the A column, is what I'm looking for in some good journeyman cinematic scares.It would be wrong to point out that it takes too long to become emotionally invested in Sinister, that Ethan Hawke is a smidgen too shallow to like or dislike his Stephen King-like character, and the movie is one big cliché, but Sinister delivers more than enough disquiet and shocks to overlook its failings.Which brings me to the general structure of Stephen King's many novels--you know, frustrated writer with a tragic character flaw confronts demon--and Ellison Oswald is so close to many of King's character that I'm wondering if Stephen King's attorneys were breaking out the Winchesters when Sinister hit the screen. Just a thought.Anyway, I had fun with Sinister, parked in front of the TV in the bedroom, chihuahua cuddled up alongside, and . . . the lights out.Thought I'd do my part.",6,1,2,18 February 2016
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," 'Greed, for want of a better word, is good.'
","Because a good movie--or a cruel one that makes people laugh--can always be made into a sequel, Chris Columbus brings us Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. HA2 delivers the poster child for UMC child neglect, Macaulay Culkin to New York wherein he is once again pursued by lunk-heads Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The locale is different, but the story is almost identical.The only major change is that Kevin and you, the audience, get to see actual homeless people in a big American city, and the audience is expected to tear up at all the meaningful Christmasness therein with a collective sob. This breaking out in a rash of caring, which is slightly less than skin deep, is the only way for the movie makers to mask their greed in making this cynical trash.",Null,0,0,21 December 2005

A Clockwork Orange," Killing a Show Tune
","A Clockwork Orange (1971)If you read the book, be patient. Learn Nadsat. After a third of the book, you'll forget there's a glossary in the back. Also, there are two versions of the book. The British and the American. As I remember, the American version has a prettified ending, or something akin to that.As far as the movie is concerned, in many ways, ACO hasn't aged well. It looks like a 1971 universe masquerading as 2017. Yet there are elements that are surreal that they translate effortlessly to any time.I remember watching it for the first time at The Magic Lantern in Spokane. I felt icky and exhilarated afterward. I saw it again in a film class at Spokane Falls Community College. A third time in the early 80s.The last time was within the last ten years. I turned off the DVD player and thought, this is how I felt when I saw Pulp Fiction--amazed at the technical expertise and disgusted by the crimson pornography Pauline Kael wrote about in the New Yorker and mentioned in the Atlantic piece by Adam Chandler.With all that said, my takeaway from ACO is never really liking Singin' in the Rain anymore. Also, Malcolm MacDowell was so effortlessly perfect as Alex, that when I watched him play a Scientology-style leader in The Mentalist, I started humming the show tune.My wife gave me a look.",7,1,1,4 February 2020
National Treasure," No 'Harumphs' Allowed!
","Only the bluest of meanies could fuss about Disney's National Treasure, a thoroughly entertaining and innocuous chase movie from Brand Bruckheimer. Nick Cage and his crew (obligatory sidekick, eye-candy, and old fart) are off to find the treasure, clues to which are encrypted on the back of the Declaration of Independence.Forget logic and just enjoy the nicely pieced-together plotting while you admire Cage's rug and Diane Kruger's rack. There's not a really dirty word in the flick and the only crudity is so subtle I almost missed it (watch Cage pull off his latex gloves in front of baddie Sean Bean; it's a hoot).Really, that's the total criticism for this fun, frothy pursuit-job. I even liked, really appreciated the reverence given to the document AND the words held within.I was impressed and ol' Walt would be proud (except that he's dead, and according to legend, his head is stuffed in a box-shaped version of one of the document holders in the movie).",Null,0,1,25 January 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Snuff Film
","Excrement.Quentin Tarantino's 'brilliant' crime drama is just an excuse to show new and exciting ways to violently violate human bodies. I actually felt sick watching this one long snuff film, with cops, robbers, civilians, and quite possibly water fowl getting shot and butchered and defiled. But hey, it's Tarantino! We're supposed to bow down to the god of guts and gore because it's all so well pieced together and film noir-ey.I watched Reservoir Dogs 23 years ago, and my impression is still one of heartache. I felt as if I had wandered into a battlefield, and I hadn't been drafted, nor had I volunteered. This trash has no-- scratch that--negative redeeming social value, unless, of course, you enjoy watching an LAPD uniformed officer, captured by Michael Madsen, get his ear cut off.Good God, what makes people think Tarantino is anything other than a pornographer? I find almost everything he has ever done disgusting and a supreme waste of my valuable time.I know that makes me a provincial redneck, an illiterate buffoon, a, a conservative, but I like to think that, usually, implied violence is more effective than the lurid, the exposed, the defiled, and the exsanguinated.",2,4,7,4 May 2016

You know where I'm going with this, don't you? Pretty Woman is the ultimate Hollywood story of a streetwalker (Julia Roberts) who just happens to be sweet and pretty and wholesome (except that she's a hooker) and how she gets hired to service a whorish corporate raider who is pretty and has a heart of gold (Richard Gere). I don't need to go into any more detail than that. Suffice it to say that somewhere after she goes down on him and he buys her a really big closetful of clothes, they fall in the sort of love that makes the girls reach for their tissues and the guys reach in their pockets, hoping that stroking their ignition keys will make the stupid and morally reprehensible movie go away.Pretty Woman is skid row gutter trash and, unfortunately, it makes the gutter in Hollywood look glamorous.",Null,1,3,29 March 2006
Inside Man," No Director Wants His Movie to be Seen as a 'Time-Waster'
","Eight years ago, I saw the preview of Spike Lee's Inside Man, and I thought that this would be a great use of entertainment dollars. Here it is, all those years later, and I have to confess I didn't mind watching it for free on TV. It's not that Inside Man is a bad movie. It's just so, so much less than meets the eye. Here we have a cast to die for--Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, and Willem Dafoe. They all do yeoman work, and Ms. Foster has to be one of the most brutally attractive women I've ever seen. Plummer, as usual, oozes spotless evil. Dafoe has a fairly thankless part as a SWAT commander. Washington looks cool in a baggy suit and snappy fedora.The odd man out here is Clive Owen as the head of a team of bank robbers who have a motive other than money. I don't know him, and if this is any indication of the man's talent, I don't need to know him. Yet.Inside Man fulfilled its mission--for the viewer to be entertained just enough, challenged just enough, and pleased just enough to forgive how vacant a movie this really is. I got done with the USA Network broadcast, popped out the disk, and fell asleep. Good movies make it difficult to nod off, and then I dream about them.I had a dreamless night after watching Inside Man.",6,1,4,25 February 2014
Pulp Fiction," Op-Ed
","I don't know how many reviews of Pulp Fiction are on the IMDb website, but I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth. If you have the time or patience, go to my review of Mean Streets, Scorcese's classic hood drama from 1973. If Mean Streets made me feel icky, Tarentino's Pulp Fiction made me feel almost feverishly sick to my stomach. PF gave me cramps as I sat squirming through the buckets of blood, the sick humor, and all the talented and elegant film-making expended to bring forth this profoundly ugly movie.I'm not religious, but Pulp Fiction and its director's predecessor, Reservoir Dogs are almost . . . evil. I don't use that word lightly, nor do I feel particularly spiritual when I see movies, but this thing and its creator feel bad, just wrong.The best movie I have ever seen is Roman Polanski's Chinatown (Polanski isn't exactly a poster boy for virtue considering his notorious legal problems) and even though the bad guys win in Chinatown, Nicholson's J.J. Gittes is a virtuous man. Virtue defeated is still virtuous. Quentin Tarantino has created more than one film where there simply is no virtue (although Samuel L. Jackson's character makes an attempt toward the end of Pulp Fiction, the soul of the movie is a darkened husk by then).Pulp Fiction is a cheerless, hateful thing that finds humor in human beings accidentally losing their lives. When I saw it, I wanted to find out what all the buzz was about. When it was through, I was depressed, sad for the vermin on the screen and off.I've written that I like movies with grit and depth; my wife likes to be entertained. If you've never seen Pulp Fiction (or if you have and want to see it again), take my advice and rent something old and Disney.Or even Chinatown. At least there's somebody to root for.",Null,0,3,4 November 2005
Glory Road," 'Gee, Who Do You Think Wins the Big Game?'
","The Roland E. Zwick review of Disney's Glory Road is a good, solid opinion piece, so my addition will be simply to acknowledge that this movie is a basket-shooting, rebounding cliché, but a visually impressive one.I don't know a lot about cameras, lenses, and film stock (if movies still use film anymore?), but there's a grainy, orangey patina to the movie that gives it its old feel, and it's very effective.Besides that, it's a solid, journeyman, underdog sports movie (with a whole lot of racial tension thrown in). Besides the color of the film, there's a laying open of the frustration and surrender black players felt after a relentless barrage of hate from opposing teams and their respective communities. Finally, key members of the team surrender to reverse hatred and lump all 'crackers' together.That was intellectually honest for the screenwriters to put in to Glory Road, the knee-jerk response to bigotry being more bigotry. This struggle--and the response to it by the coaches--raises the movie above its fairly low performance.There's just a bit more to this cliché fest than first meets the eye.",Null,0,1,26 February 2007
War of the Worlds," The Flaming Train . . .
","definitely isn't a metaphor for Spielberg's retelling of Wells' classic. In fact, the blazing Amtrak is one of the few things I found startling and innovative in this dark, dreary 'message' about how mean and nasty we Americans are for 'occupying' Iraq.Yup, the movie is the metaphor, and what a dull one at that. Oh, don't get me wrong, I watched the thing on TNT, with some language and gore snipped out, and I got emotionally snagged again on the concept of Armaggeddon, but I simply didn't care about the characters. I don't know if it was my dislike of Tom Cruise or the distance I had between Tim Robbins or Dakota Fanning or the kid who played Cruise's son and me as the viewer. I just spent my time watching how Spielberg would breathe life into a story I first learned from the great (I wish I could italicize the word 'great' on IMDb) George Pal production from 1953. There was no breath, no wisp of a breeze that would have raised this dull, boring, episodic, and truncated piece of space junk out of the hole it was buried in before the cameras first rolled. Even the Martian tripods lumbered along as if their drivers were on the clock, but their souls were elsewhere. The only time I shot straight up and paid close attention was when we finally got to look at the aliens, creeping, bipedal, sea creature-like entities that (they're sentient so I should say 'who') take interest in family photographs before they skitter away to answer the blaring horn coming from their tripod.And then they are gone. Until we see one hanging out of a crashed tripod, gasping for air, thick rills of snot vibrating from its mouth. And then its dead.The train, the Martians in Tim Robbins' basement, the one almost begging for help from a group of soldiers--that's all we get. Everything else was so much CGI noise and nastiness.I was begging, pleading with the movie gods to send in a great white or a velociraptor. Why did we get stuck with Tom Cruise? Couldn't Spielberg find someone like Richard Dreyfuss or Roy Schieder? I swear, War of the Worlds is nothing more than one of those Jaws knockoffs from 1977, only this one had lots of cash to throw around. The whole thing reeks of cynicism, of a desire to stick it to the audience and deliver a 'message' few people wanted to receive. Oh, well. The movie made a bunch of money. I know I write these reviews (this is my 400th) for my health and my love of writing. I accept that Stephen Spielberg remade a movie in his vision. I know it failed my test, but if my review keeps one person from bothering with it the next time it's shown on ABC or TNT, then it's not a pointless exercise in self-indulgence.Which is exactly what Spielberg created here.",4,1,3,13 March 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of the Source Code of Tomorrow's Adjustment Bureau
","I so dislike Tom Cruise that when I pay attention to a character he's playing, I feel as if I've gotten my time's worth out of a movie. I so like Emily Blunt that she could spout some dreary anti-Trump twaddle on a late-night comedy show, and I would turn off the sound and just gaze.Doug Liman's Edge of Tomorrow gets off to such a weak start, with Cruise looking as if he lost his confidence when he heard 'action' and Brendan Gleeson looking bored to tears, that I almost gave up. But I stuck around, deciding I would give the movie a chance. And off she went!Cruise's character is such a spineless feather-merchant that you actually start to enjoy his discomfort-fear-loathing-confusion-panic as he gets dropped onto a beach in France to fight some sort of spider/octopus thingies, of which there are about a zillion. He sees Blunt get killed, then gets it himself, and . . .Wakes up where he started, at a staging area for the invasion force in England.With some dandy editing, forgivable lapses in logic, enough true humor, and the whole concept of reliving your death so that you don't get killed, eventually, the viewer gets hooked. Deep.And then the last reel starts, and the whole thing falls apart. It's a murky mess, with a bunch of volunteers helping Cruise and Blunt fight their way to the queen spider thingamabob (which actually looks like a spongy, electrified golf ball) to kill it. It's all so dark and confusing that the viewer wonders what the hell happened to the crisp narrative in the first two thirds.Oh, well.All in all, it was a good use of time. I gauge 'good' by how much I'm not getting done around the house. The chores don't get done, and the movie gets above a 5. My wife gets home and wonders if I did anything, the score goes up.I told her that the movie had Emily Blunt, and she rolled her eyes and said something unpleasant.She doesn't like Tom Cruise either.",6,0,3,9 March 2017

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," If It Bleeds . . .
","BYGHT wrote a great review of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. I would suggest reading his review first before anything I have to say. I think he's right about Anchorman. It's much more than the cookie-cutter comedies that pollute the theater screens and home entertainment centers across the country. There is some--not a lot, but some--sharp parody here. Anchorman is a flawed and, probably, too silly send up of the news business on TV. Yet it is something of a good companion piece to, say, the much, much more highbrow Broadcast News.I think what makes Anchorman work is that it really does catch you by surprise. You're expecting a movie that pokes fun at the '70s or just a Will Ferrell vehicle. You sit down in anticipation of a battle of the sexes or just 90+ minutes of frat-boy humor. But A:TLORB gives you all of these things. It's a multi-joke movie; it multi-tasks! Although it misfires from time to time with its fluffy wackiness bordering on just-too-weird, Anchorman delivers more than enough belly laughs and guffaws to keep the viewer with an IQ above room temperature chuckling and interested. Ferrell is maddeningly sincere in his portrayal of the shallow and idiotic Ron Burgundy. His supporting cast do what they're supposed to do--support him. And Christina Applegate shows enough talent to not get bowled over by the comedy heavyweights.Applegate is not only beautiful, but there's something tough and ambitious about her--I think it was the smoking--that plays well against the cocksure idiots with which she has to contend. You go into Anchorman not expecting much, but being pleasantly surprised by her performance.She is a metaphor for why Anchorman is a much-better-than-average product of Brand SNL.",Null,0,1,8 May 2007
The Green Mile," A Mythical, Mystical Retelling
","The film version of Stephen King's novel, a retelling of the story of Christ's Crucifixion, is possibly one of the most beautifully bittersweet and deeply emotionally satisfying pieces of film making I've ever seen. The Green Mile works on so many levels, a mystical story of God's love and forgiveness, a loving story of friends working together toward a common good, and a brutality-tinged mystery of who killed two little girls in Depression-era Louisiana. I cannot find a really significant flaw in King's writing, the ensemble cast's performances, or Frank Darabont's direction.This is a gem and a blessing!",Null,3,6,28 February 2006
Ray," It's Taylor Hackford, Stupid!
","I've read some really bad and good criticism of Taylor Hackford's Ray and the 'rinse and repeat' comment on the message boards rings true, sort of. Hackford manages to beautifully film brilliant performances and some of the great, great music of our time . . . and almost loses it in his trademark soap suds.Like Joaquin Phoenix's Johnny Cash, Jamie Foxx breathes youth into Ray Charles, a man of intense vibrancy. At times I really believed I was watching Charles punching through genre and race barriers while sinking into morphine-derived self-pity. But the episodic nature of Hackford's pacing helps distract the viewer from the deeper truth of Charles' life. Ray Charles was a giant talent, but a man nonetheless. Hackford keeps slipping into suds and slickery and it almost sucks the oxygen out of Ray's lungs.Yet, it's the flawless editing of Charles' music into Foxx's mouth that keeps you glued to the screen. It's so real that you want to forgive the flaws of direction and screen writing.I say we cut Hackford some slack and thank him--and Foxx--for documenting one America's great performers of the last sixty years.",Null,1,2,5 February 2007
Halloween," Getting to Watch Great Movie Making
","I think Roger Ebert said that the reason John Carpenter's Halloween was so good could be attributed to the way the actors looked on screen--they all appeared to be having a great ol' time.He's right and it does show. Halloween is not only a fine piece of scarecraft, but it has a fresh, go-ahead-and-criticize-all-you-want look and feel. It was an inexpensive movie to make, but you don't get the feeling of cheapness.. There are people who have gone on to greatness and character actors and actresses who have quietly left the stage, but for 21 days in the spring of 1978, the cast and crew of Halloween were at the top of their creativity, and reaching a high point (if that's possible) in the 'You Screw, You Die' genre.Everything I can think of after Halloween was cheap-looking, slasher films that looked like Xerox copies without enough toner, except the red.Bravo!",Null,0,1,16 April 2007
Carrie," 31 Years Later, and I Still Shudder
","Brian DePalma's Carrie is a defining-moment movie for me. I saw a lot of movies when I was in my upper-classman years of high school and I don't think I ever saw anything like Carrie to date, gory to the point of gasping, filled with high school viciousness and pubic hair, and with a heroine as repulsive as the stuff inside the zits on your forehead. I saw it just six months after graduating from high school, when kids often go into a blue funk because they miss the structure of, but not the culture of high school, and I felt as if I was watching home movies of some of the people I hated in school.Carrie was shocking and horrifying, dirty and very, very sad.But more than that, it's a great little supernatural flick, with fine performances, zesty pacing, and a lot of heart. To this day, I enjoy Sissy Spacek's work, because she was able to pull off Carrie White (although the girl in Stephen King's book is a lumpy mess of protoplasm and DePalma had to work to make the pretty, wholesome, and curvy Spacek look bad). Travolta can be taken seriously, too. Piper Laurie scared the Holy Water out of me.I could go on listing the cast members who were very impressive, but I'm running out of time here, and you know it was a great cast.I remember seeing Carrie at the State Theatre in Spokane during a November snowstorm. My best friend and I exited after the movie and I still recall feeling blue. Not because I was one of the popular kids at Shadle Park High School (I wasn't), but because there was so much I had missed. For some reason, this horror movie about a horse-face of a girl with a late menstrual cycle and telekinetic powers made me sad, made me miss high school.Great movie, strange frame of mind. 31 years ago on a snowy night.",Null,2,3,12 April 2007

Throw in the almost-always watchable Samuel L. Jackson and the lovely Mary McCormack and the human element is solidly set.Then, there's the creepy stuff, two hours of demons and nasties, corpses and winking dopplegangers, and Karen Carpenter warbling on the clock radio that had me right where a psychological horror movie needed me to be.One foot in the keep watching and the other in the get the hell out of here.",6,0,1,24 April 2014

Signs," Shyamalan, 1 Spielberg, 0
","M. Night Shyamalan's Signs feels like a loose retelling of H. G. Well's War of the Worlds because there's something ubiquitous on Earth the pointy, clicking little acrobats can't abide. If that's true, then Signs is a vastly superior--and very, very scary-- version of Well's work. This movie elicited such dread from me that I had to shut off the tape repeatedly and take a breather. It's that good.Compared to Spielberg's 2005 version, Signs looks even better. Spielberg managed to turn his work into a overblown, episodic, and ultimately very frustrating movie that only scared me when I got to see his aliens (and that was too damn little face time for me!).I think Signs was one of the few horror movies I've seen in anything like recent history that makes me shiver when I think of it--and I saw it in the summer of 2007!That's staying power.",8,4,8,28 May 2014
Speed," Not What One Would Refer to as a Christmas Movie
","Yet, that's when I saw Jan de Bont's Speed, cuddled up in our new house in the wee hours of Christmas morning, 1994, I think. I couldn't turn it off.And the reasons for this were:Speed is a wonderfully energetic piece of film-making. It mixes the formulaic with the fresh, the mad criminal (Dennis Hopper) with the hero (Keanu Reeves), but this time, with a strong and gutty blue-collar woman (Sandra Bullock). The hook--the bus that can't slow down or the bomb will go off--is both simple and effective. And, de Bont never lets the action subside. He knows he has a winner here, and he'll be damned if he'll let anyone be a slacker!Is Speed great cinema? Yes, but it's because it's a technically superior piece of entertainment. Nobody's going to remember it for the acting.What we will remember, past the thrills, is meeting Sandra Bullock.Bullock is such a big star now that her breakout performance may get forgotten for younger audiences. De Bont must have seen that she would power this picture with her humanity, quirky good looks, and chutzpah.Which brings me back to Christmas morning, 3 a.m. or so. Across the room sat the TV and VCR. I held the remote, and when my wife would stir, I would pause the tape and wait. It took some time to get through the movie because, although she slept well that morning, my wife was and is a light sleeper. The only reason I mention this Christmas stuff is that watching Speed felt like that Christmas present your folks let you open on Christmas Eve. It was a delight, and considering how good Sandra Bullock is as an actress--and I forgive her for The Proposal--and how deeply lovely she is, Speed is a present that I still appreciate 20 odd years later.Now, Keanu Reeves in the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, that's where my forgiveness and Christmas spirit dry up.",8,0,3,2 April 2014
RED," Tightrope
","You have to get this thing just right--the mixture of comedy, violence, menace, and absurdity. Red just about gets it right, and I must say I just sat there last night smiling as I waited for the soufflé to collapse. It didn't, and for that I am grateful, but Red never really takes off either. The cast is obviously having a lot of fun. The adult girls get Bruce Willis and the same demographic of boys get Mary Louise Parker and Helen Mirren. Nobody has much to do that makes sense, but who cares? Red isn't meant to be art, just fun.And for the most part, funny.",6,0,1,23 April 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," The Stuff in the Middle of a Twinkie
","Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is the sort of silly fun with a long shelf-life that will have you grinning throughout the movie. This gentle but hip story of two goofy kids who get involved in an intersection of time travel and guitar riffs is by no means great art, nor is it a completely accurate time encapsulation of the late 1980's. It is fun and funny with only a few bad words and sexual innuendo ('Shut up, Ted!) thrown in to give it a PG.BTEA works well because of its deft performances, its tight plotting, and the fact that it is about as consequential as the tasty glop in the middle of a Twinkie. Come to think of it, because of its strengths, this movie will probably be putting smiles on viewer's faces right about the time a 1989 Twinkie finally starts to go bad.",Null,0,0,29 November 2005
The Matrix," What is the big deal?
","Pardon me for being an adult, but I cannot understand the hype of this movie, past the breathtaking special effects, of course. This mess has all of the elements I have grown to hate most in a modern movie: The wooden acting, the predictable shootouts (with thousands of guns and millions of bullets), the noise, the gut-bashing violence. I may sound like an old prude, but, without the techno-dazzle, this is just a stultifyingly dull mess of scififoolishness.On the other hand, the sfx were so amazing that I sat through it to the end. I must say that the fans of this movie are a passionate lot. I told a friend of what I thought of The Matrix and he looked at me as if I had twin stalks of celery sticking out of my ears.So, if I sound stupid because I JUST DON'T GET IT, oh, well. I guess I shouldn't have taken the blue pill before watching it.No, not that blue pill! Sheesh, you people are annoying.(Just an after-thought--I watched The Matrix a few weeks ago, 12 years after writing this, and it still was stupid.)",Null,3,7,31 March 2005
Looper," Even Wikipedia has its Limits
","Beyond the obvious visual pleasure of Emily Blunt in farm-girl chic, there's nothing but incoherence to be found in Rian Johnson's Looper, a movie so chock-full of bewildering nonsense that the viewer needs to loop back to Blunt, or Joseph Gordon-Levitt for the girls. I watched this sci-fier a week ago, and it feels as if I know less now than just after the credits rolled.I went to my best buddy, Wikipedia, to make sense of Looper by reading the plot synopsis. It didn't help. Like the guy who is having his parts snipped off one by one in the movie--and can see the result 30 years in the past or the future or a week from Thursday--every time I try to figure Looper out, there's less there.I'm so frustrated with the time-traveling and the telekinesis and the 30 second steak and eggs and the Chevy running in 2044 and the fact that the movie makes no damned sense at all that I just have to accept that Looper, which looked so interesting in the trailers, is a colossal waste of time.",3,3,6,1 February 2016
Heat," One of my favorites
","With the extensive commentary by other reviewers, there's not much I can add here, other than this is one of my favorite crime dramas. There's so little crime and violence in my life that Heat seems to be a foreign film--and what a great one at that! Michael Mann has told a story of people I don't want to know but care about anyway. I was shocked and angered and frightened by the lives of DeNiro and Pacino and Sizemore and Kilmer. Heat is simply one of the most effective stories about criminals I've ever seen. It's not meant to be a message film or a documentary, just really good storytelling of a harsh, angry story.I don't want this level of misery and violence in my life, but watching good and evil battle it out in Heat on the streets and between the warehouses of LA was and one of the better 2 and 1/2 hour blocks I've spent in front of a screen.",Null,2,4,4 March 2005
Jackie Brown," Paging Elmore Leonard
","That rarity of Tarantino films, more character than gore. Who would have ever thought it possible?The only reason Jackie Brown works, and works quite well, is that it's based on a novel by the late Elmore Leonard. Now, Leonard could go pretty medieval in his novels, but his characters always felt like real people, good 'uns and bad. The language coming out of their mouths sounded real. I saw Jackie Brown some 15 years ago, about the same time I saw Out of Sight, based on another Leonard work, and I thought the two made great bookends. They seemed to honor Elmore Leonard. Seeing the movies made me want to read more Leonard novels. Imagine my surprise when I found out that the Charles Bronson flick, Mr. Majestyk, was one of his. I love that movie, and it made me love it more.15 years after my viewing Jackie Brown, the story itself is pretty much gone, but I do recall that it was suspenseful, had interesting folks doing bad and not-so-bad things, and even had a smidgen of humor that didn't depend on John Travolta hitting a chuckhole and blowing some poor doofus' head off.I have not seen the Django thing or Kill Thrill Bill, 1-47, or Inglorious Remakes or the recent Hateful Hatful. If I want to participate in Tarantino's pornographic horror shows, I guess I should watch more, but why would I want to? He hit his high point with the film version of a pretty good crime novel, and all we can do now is bring a mop to the theatre to push around the blood sloshing off the screen.Gag.",Null,1,1,4 May 2016
Gangs of New York," Becoming a Vegan
","About the 73rd bucket of blood finally did me in with Martin Scorcese's vomitous mess of a historical epic, Gangs of New York. This over-hyped, lurid, and nauseatingly meaty tripe is a 2.5 hour reason for swearing off animal flesh, butchery of any kind, and any desire to visit New York's more historical neighborhoods.I sat in gape-mouthed amazement at the gutting, gashing, and gore that culminates in one scene, with rioters sloshing through movie blood. I lost interest in all the characters-or the story, for that matter-after only the 37th corpse piled up in the streets of 'the Five Points.' The colors, the performances, and the fascinating new ways to impale a human body on blade, pike, or cleaver may appeal to the red-meat eaters in the audience-of whom I may just no longer be one-but I'm thinking it's time to clean out the arteries and the brain cells.And go cold turkey on Scorcese.",Null,3,6,21 January 2008
Windtalkers," Flashpot Psychology
","Any war movie that conveniently stops all extraneous sound—that is, battle—so that characters can give other characters thoughtful speeches or looks is going to wear the patience of the viewer to the breaking point very quickly. John Woo's Windtalkers (2002) is just such a movie, a sloppy, messy, and incompetent story of the Navajo contribution to America's victory against Imperial Japan. Whatever drama that can be found with the ground-breaking use of the totally alien (at least to the Japanese) Navajo language as the basis for a combat code is lost with the five cent psychology and movie-of-the-week histrionic heroics.The story itself is fascinating—Navajo men with a good grasp of their language were trained as radio operators and deployed with U.S. Marine units in the island-hopping operations of the Pacific War. Adam Beach, the Canadian actor who was so great in Smoke Signals, and played another marine, Ira Hayes, in Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers, is the principal character here, alongside his hardened and hard-hearted 'handler,' Nicolas Cage, an emotionally wrecked 'China Marine' who takes the job of watching over—and killing Beach if he is about to be captured—as a way to get back into the war, after recuperating from injuries on Guadalcanal.The contrast between Cage and Beach is adequate. You don't expect much from Cage because he's vitiated much of his acting 'street cred' with one Jerry Bruckheimer role after another (he seems more at ease in the National Treasure franchise than in something serious) and Beach is so charismatic that it's obvious Woo was having to rein him in, in order to keep him from stealing every scene from Cage. There are obligatory secondary characters—the tough gunnery sergeant, the more religious Navajo friend of Beach (if you look closely, you can see a small, neon 'Dead' sign over this character, along with several others), and, because this is Hollywood and all combat units are microcosm melting-pots (and large, blonde white guys are naturally obnoxious Hitler Youth), there's a large, blonde bigot who questions the Navajos' presence in the war because 'they look just like the 'Nips'.'Everything about Windtalkers reeks of cheap and thrown-together. It's painful to watch such a wonderful, multi-layered story of American natives casting aside old angers to protect what Beach refers to as 'my land, my country' rendered into a junior high school-level shoot-em-up. The script seems cobbled together from a dozen 40s and 50s war movies (at any moment, you expect John Wayne—who played a character similar to Cage's in The Sands of Iwo Jima, and a whole lot better—to tell everyone to 'Saddle up; let's get back in the war!' Even the special effects are all over the battlefield. We get Saving Private Ryan savagery, along with some nice CGI carrier-based aircraft, but those damn-silly artillery explosions. Howitzer rounds go bang (dirt and things go flying) but Woo figured he had to dazzle the viewer with lots of color, so we get these ridiculous gasoline flashpots going up when a mortar round hits a group of soldiers (how many times were the troops told not to put fifty gallons of lighter fluid in their Zippos, dammit?).The non-verbal messages are, if anything, less important and more overbearing than the spoken words. The flashback is a classic film device for filling in the holes in a story (or telling it in a non-linear way), and so is the 'reaction' shot. When something profound happens in Windtalkers, the viewer gets some of that five cent psychology by viewing deep, meaningful stares. The non-verbal meaningfulisms are so heavy-handed that when, in a moment for Cage that shows he saw The Sands of Iwo Jima over and over before filming started here, where he draws a cathedral in flour on a table, then grunts in disgust at himself for showing weakness and destroys the drawing, you're hoping a war correspondent runs in to take a photo of the cathedral before Cage wipes it out.Aw, shucks, Sgt. Rock has a heart of gold! Cage's equal in the platoon, played by Christian Slater (neon 'Dead' sign) is assigned to another Navajo. Repeatedly warned not to warm to his charge, Slater violates his orders by striking up a musical relationship with him. The message of equality and friendship between a Navajo and the son of a Swedish immigrant is mostly unspoken (the music is produced by native flute and harmonica). Unfortunately, the friendship results in disaster. When confronted with following his orders, Slater can't bring himself to kill his friend, and it's left up to Cage to do Slater's dirty work.The truth of the engagement—and the underlying orders to 'protect the code' is revealed to Beach by Cage. Beach isn't skilled enough—or isn't given enough directorial guidance—to avoid falling into an acting trap. His unspoken rage at and mistrust of Cage is displayed in an almost comical . . . dirty look. Wayne could do it, so could Kirk Douglas. Eastwood had that murderous glare that accompanied 'Well, do ya punk?!' Beach didn't have it here. I kept expecting him to point at Cage and let loose with a Marvin the Martian impression, 'Oooh, you make me sooo angree!' The trouble with Windtalkers is that, because it's hackneyed to begin with, there's a ripple effect of silliness throughout the movie. A good premise with a bad script is going to result in a stilted mess of a movie. Besides spouting cringe-inducing dialogue, the emotional points of the movie are hammered home (right through my forehead sometimes) with glowering reactions shots. 'Hey, he's a rednecked moron' is what we already know about the platoon bigot from his words and behavior. Having him come to this conclusion, stopping in the middle of a marching column, looking as if he has worked mightily and has given birth to a thought, is just overkill.The spoken and unspoken words of Windtalkers devalue the whole noble story.",Null,1,2,7 July 2009
Coach Carter," Yeast Infection
","Inspirational sports movies are like yeast infections--treat them badly and they just keep coming back. Coach Carter is yet another in an endless line of movies with underdog teams proving everyone wrong and winning (or in this case . . . ) the big game. The only thing that stands out in CC is Samuel L. Jackson (who does a great Samuel L. Jackson impression in everything he does). Even when he's sleepwalking through a movie, he has the command presence that keeps you watching even when you have something better to do--like changing the air in your basketball.What I found most distressing about this 135 minute cliché is the whole inner-city, gangsta culture. At every level, there's something for adults to cringe at and kids to try to emulate. You know knuckleheads all across the country are watching the movie, not for the freedom-comes-from-academics theme, but for the Ebonics and the baggy clothes and the trash talk and the 'bitches.' It's the sight of kids running up and down a court playing a game. You could show two hours of ESPN in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and a lot of the audience would just sit there lapping it up.Here, we get a big bag o' drama along with the game stuff, a veritable full-meal-deal.Keep it real!",Null,0,1,2 April 2007

It took me about ten minutes to grow tired of this preachy mess, with George Miller and his crew pounding you about the head and neck with the blunt object of how awful humans are for fishing and putting wild animals in zoos.Puh-leeze! Happy Feet was released by Warner Brothers, but the only cliché missing was somebody warbling, crooning, or burping Disney's 'Follow your heart!' command. And once again, my lovely wife and daughter liked it.But not as much as they used to.Is it possible that tiresome movies about cute lil' critters fighting off the rapacious bastardy that is humankind might have grown old for them?We can all only hope.",Null,1,2,10 April 2007
Gladiator," 'I am Spartacus-I mean-Maximus!'
","And Ridley Scott ain't Stanley Kubrick! Scott's sort-of remake of the modestly brilliant and richly emotional Spartacus and the horrendously bad Fall of the Roman Empire is a visually breathtaking epic that has almost no soul. I can't think of a reason to watch this movie other than to be entertained by three hours of close up violence, dazzling computer graphics, Russell Crowe's manliness, Connie Nielsen's loveliness, and Joaquim Phoenix's pree-versions.Done with the movie? You've got nothing to show for it.I don't worry too much about the myriad historical inaccuracies, such as the Roman Republic being reestablished at the end of Gladiator or Marcus Aurelius being murdered (if you have a clue about Roman history, you've just got to grin and bear it), but it's the reliance on the razzle-dazzle of the computer over the emotional depth of the characters that wears Gladiator down and leaves it bleeding in the center of the arena. The opening battle in Germany is eye-popping (and stomach-turning) in its recreation of a fight between Crowe's legion and a pack of Teutonic mouth-breathers. You're supposed to be impressed and hooked, but then the internecine backstabbing, betraying, and incestuous hanky-pankying start and you're left waiting for the next trip into some North African arena where you can watch people get disemboweled in the same grainy fashion as in Saving Private Ryan.It's all very appealing at a lizard-at-the-bottom-of-the-brain pan level (When I saw Gladiator in a theater in Ontario, Oregon, I heard a kid complaining, 'When are we gonna see her (Nielsen) naked?'). Front-load the gore and the kink, dazzle the viewer with recreations of the Roman world, and you don't need to get past Russell Crowe's growling and Phoenix's fussy sickness.Gladiator is emotionally empty.

The Wedding Singer," Strange, I Never Had Hair THAT Big!
","One of a small, but slowly growing list of Adam Sandler movies that aren't expressly designed for morons, 1998's The Wedding Singer is a sweet, generally and genuinely funny vehicle for Sandler and Drew Barrymore to show some real chemistry and artistry. We are only subjected to a few of Sandler's trademark outbursts and, because of that marshaling of his raging resources, the title character is both funny and sympathetic.It's like a 60s Jerry Lewis movie where somebody else directed. Sandler is charismatic, fun to watch and to root for. But only when he reins it in--or is reined in.I've never really cared one way or another for Drew Barrymore (and I'm one of the seven people in the world who just hated ET with an unbridled passion), but before she got all buff and sexy and moviestarrish in this decade, there was a time that she was chunky and a bit goofy-looking and sexy/believable. In The Wedding Singer, she is one of the more appealing female leads you might ever see because she isn't one of those interchangeable, pointy-breasted bimbettes I complained about in my review of HappyWaterMadison.The Wedding Singer isn't great art, nor is it great film making, but it is fun and only to a certain extent, predictable. I recommend it for four reasons: Sandler and Barrymore's performances, the music, the sweetness of the story, and seeing that Billy Idol only got snarkier over the years!",Null,1,2,2 April 2007
The Proposal," An Offer I Could Have Refused
","Trash.When Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds bump into each other by accident--in the nude--I realized that this scene is an economy of scale, a miniature of The Proposal, a painfully unfunny and moronic collision of concept and cynicism. Bullock, Reynolds, and the entire auxiliary cast are so astonishingly bad, so dull and unpleasant, that the only entertainment that could possibly be derived was to see if my beloved wife and daughter would declare it good . . . and me bad.I reviewed Practical Magic a few years ago and, if you go back to read it, you'll notice that I had some kind things to say about Sandra Bullock's pleasant believability on screen.Where did it go? The woman I found breathtakingly normal ten years ago looks and acts as if she is just a skin shade shy of a George Romero undead-person; Bullock shambles zombie-like through the movie. The only thing missing in her frigid executive non-performance is her not throwing that stupid dog into the bay. I would have given anything to watch her grab Betty White to rip out her throat (not that I have anything against Betty White--it's just that THAT would have been original!).Everything sucked in this movie, even the idea that Reynold's family couldn't be a normal working-stiff clan, but a dysfunctional way- upper middle class bunch of unappealing boobs.But . . .I did get two hours of uninterrupted quality time with the family. The snow was flying outside. The coffee was good. The Chihuahua hopped up to cuddle on my chest.When I go home on my prep period from the high school I work at to help my wife load up trash to take to the transfer station, I can either grumble about how my clothes smell funny the rest of the day or I can say I got to spend some quality time with my sweetheart and best friend.I guess that's why I called The Proposal garbage.",Null,0,2,1 February 2010
All the President's Men," A heartbreaker for the patriots among us
","I can't even guess how many times I've seen Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men. It never gets old, it never wears thin. This quintessential cautionary tale of political corruption just may be the best American movie ever made about a leader destroying himself with paranoia and felony.Now, whether or not it is completely historically accurate can be debated until the next milennium, but the basic story of ordinary (and less than nice) reporters stumbling on a story bigger than they can imagine and running it (and the President of the United States) to ground is inherently fascinating, the way courtroom dramas are almost unavoidably watchable. There is no gunplay here, no heaving bosoms or car chases, but the story of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, lucking onto a bit of Nixonian chicanery here and there until it becomes apparent that their (and our) president is trying to cook the books with illegal contributions and political 'rat-screwing' is flat-out riveting. If you've seen it (or you haven't and you hold an above-room-temperature-IQ), you'll find this story and its storytelling more compelling than a hundred, a thousand shootemups.Above all, it's a heartbreaking movie because, thirty-plus years later, Nixon has lost his reputation of being a monster (unless you're a raging, Moveon.org moonbat). Read enough of Nixon (especially the book about his friendship and his competition with President Kennedy by Chris Matthews) and Tricky Dick reverts back to just big ol' jowly Nixon, a human being again, and a damaged and damned one at that.Although some Democrats loved seeing Nixon brought down and some Republicans would have excused anything he did, average Americans simply looked at the president and said to themselves, 'Typical politician--a crook.' Nixon's personal failings did a tremendous injury to the nation and All the President's Men shows, masterfully, the reporter's pen, the surgeon's scalpel, if you will, cutting out the cancer Nixon created in the West Wing.When ATPM came out, two years after Nixon's resignation, the interest in seeing Nixon destroyed on screen was keen, very hateful and sadly un-American (in that, we are generally a forgiving and gentle people). Now, a third of a century after Nixon destroyed himself, viewers might not understand how angry, how deeply betrayed the American people felt. Alan Pakula has created a lasting testament to the necessity of a free press and the misery caused by a corrupted leader.Regardless of your politics, All the President's Men is a gut-wrenching must-see.",10,5,9,18 March 2006

I can find no flaw in the film.My suggestion for you--if you haven't seen TWOZ in awhile--is to grab a restored copy from the late '90s. But if you have an old tape from CBS, pop it in anyway. When the news blares that the price of a barrel of oil is topping $100+ or the body of a baby was found in a dumpster or some other ghastly event, big or small, chills you to the core, watch Dorothy and her thoroughly human compadres go on their quest to find what they already had in the first place.Take heart.
