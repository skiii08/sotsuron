The Sound of Music," One of my all time favourites!
","I've been watching The Sound of Music and other such musicals since I was a kid and adore them all, but nothing quite tops this wonderful musical.I know every word of every song off by heart (ask my house mates if you don't believe me)and will watch it at every chance I get because it never fails to cheer me up.I don't know what it is about The Sound of Music that I love so much, maybe its the singing and songs, maybe its the nuns or maybe its the kids and how naughty they are - they've done all the things that you wish you'd done as a kid, like putting spiders in their governess' bed, shimming up and down drainpipes, falling into rivers and running all over the Austrian hills singing... sounds like my idea of paradise! Its just a lovely film, my all time Fave! No one else could have even come close to Julie Andrews playing the part of Maria the fallen Nun.If you haven't seen it already - why not? Go on, go and get a copy and watch it now. You won't regret it - unless you hate musicals of course!",10,5,14,4 January 2006
Grease," Grease...what more is there to say?
","Here comes my love of musicals again! Again another film I've been watching since I was a kiddie - probably why I never tire of watching it! I love it - the colours, the actors, the songs and music.I know every single song and most of the lines. I still to this day can't quite believe that, that is the same Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) at the end, all dolled up with her permed hair, fag in mouth, pierced ears and very tight catsuit (which she apparently had to be sewn into!) You can't help falling in love with Danny (John Travolta) as he is gorgeous, you know, the type of cool good looking guy that every girl wants to go out with.I don't have a favourite actor or actress in this movie because they are all brilliant. Sorry if I sound like I'm gushing! One thing I didn't realise till I was an adult was the amount of sexual innuendo and rude comments made. Which proves that it is a film for adults and children.I can't stop watching it and it will forever put a smile on my face.",10,3,5,4 January 2006
Gone with the Wind," One of the all time greats...
","After watching this film on New Years day 2006, I've come to realise that this film is one of the all time greats. The best 3 hours of my life I've ever wasted (much better than Titanic!) I've seen this film twice, once when I was 12 and again now 10 years later, and every time I watch it I become infatuated by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, his looks and his personality. It saddens me that Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) doesn't realise how much Rhett really loves her until the last minute when 'darling Ashley' proclaims 'I don't know how I'm going to live with out her' 'her' being 'darling Melanie'. Which is when the famous line...'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn' comes to life and never fails to crack me up.Vivien Leigh, plays Scarlett O'Hara so well, you really do want to slap her for being such a cold and heartless b*t*h! If you haven't seen it, see it, you won't be disappointed and you might even learn a bit about American History in case you weren't up to scratch on it.",10,1,2,4 January 2006
Moulin Rouge!," Love it, love it, love it!
","I love the songs, the over the top acting, the colours, Ewan McGregor...I highly recommend everyone to see it even if you hate it, just so you can have an opinion on it - i've been trying to get my boyfriend to watch it for ages! One of the loveliest, heart warming, heartbreaking films that you'll ever see and sing along to.If you love musicals like me then this film is Definitely for you.Best to watch it when your wide awake though as it can be hard to follow!One of the all time greats.See it!",8,1,4,4 January 2006
