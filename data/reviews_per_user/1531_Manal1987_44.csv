The King's Speech," That's how movies should be made!
","Movie-making at its finest! The King's Speech shows that it is not the great story or the great characters that make a movie worth watching... it is all about how this movie is made. King George VI was a stammer. A trivial fact that you might come across in history books. To build up a motivational and heart-wrenching story based on this very simple piece of information that you will probably pass by and take slightly in any other occasion is absolute brilliance! The King's Speech is not about a speech or a stuttering king, it is about finding the courage in each one of us through making peace with our fears and tolerating our shortcomings. The movie was touching, witty (thanks to the unbelievably beautiful script) and sometimes incredibly funny! The performance was epic. Geoffrey Rush was adorable as usual as the king's speech therapist. Guy Pearce deserves an applause for his small, yet eye-catching role as King George's flamboyant brother. As for Colin Firth, I used to love the guy.. but now I love him even more and more. A lifetime, unforgettable performance by the extremely talented and very decent Mr. Firth. He certainly deserves every ounce of gold in the Oscar he grabbed for this role.",8,1,2,29 March 2011
The Lobster," The Lobster: The Absurdist Brilliance of Yorgos Lanthimos
","In a world where staying single is a breach of acceptable social norms, single people are isolated in a hotel and forced to find a partner in 45 days otherwise they will be turned into an animal of their choosing. People who somehow manage to escape to the woods are called 'loners' and are occasionally hunted by the hotel dwellers. An incongruous story that must have made Kafka dance in his grave, not only because it breaks away from logic but because it takes the absurd to a new level of significance. The Lobster has all elements of absurdist fiction – dark humor, irrationality, and cynicism, add to that a lurking social criticism that hits your mind and soul hard. The narrative is constructed in a way that lures you into giving up all your logical defenses after the first few minutes and totally surrender to the surreality of events. I truly envy writer and director Yorgos Lanthimos for having a mind that can come up with such twisted and brilliant stories.If you have to choose between pretending to have feelings when you don't and pretending not to have feelings when you do, which would you prefer? This seems to be the kernel question of the film. The hotel dwellers are forced to pretend they have feelings for people in order to avoid being turned into animals. On the other hand, the loners are banned from showing feelings for each other even if they do. This absurd conundrum levels harsh criticism against a society that advocates binary opposition, an inherent concept that has become part and parcel of the human belief system of love and relationships as well. From the beginning of the film, it is made clear that there are no gray areas in this world; you're either heterosexual or homosexual, a size 44 or a size 45. It might not be that severe in the real world, but emotional extremism is just as bad. If you are in a relationship, you are expected to love to the fullest, and if you appreciate isolation and individuality, you are stigmatized as a heartless loner all the way through. Whatever you choose, you have to bend your personality or change something in yourself to fit in either group. In the film, this forced appropriation takes an emotional and a physical form, and it keeps you wondering which leaves more permanent scars, emotional or physical transformation? The story disparages a society that fails to acknowledge the paradoxical human condition – humans need company, yet they are innately loners; they love other people, yet they love themselves more; they have feelings, yet feelings are not meant to last forever; they are spiritual, yet predominantly physical. A world that fails to recognize this complexity is a pathetic, oppressive place.As usual, Lanthimos' script is funny, iaconic and strikingly smart; all the dialogues are meaningful despite their seeming absurdity, and the scenes are meticulously written to contribute to the intricate world of the story and its underlying intended significance. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when the hotel manager (Olivia Colman) visits David (Colin Farrell) in his room and tells him that he has to carefully choose the animal he wants to turn into because, as an animal, he won't be able to have a sexual relationship with an animal of a different species, something that he can't already do as a human being since he has to find a 'matching' partner. The whole conversation is very humorous and absurd, and the joke continues as we see how people strive hard to find matching qualities in their partners including nosebleeds, limps, good voice, shortsightedness and lack of emotions. An extremely elaborate and cunning joke that deconstructs the myth of soulmate.I think the acting is great and one of the main sources of dark humor and irony in the film. Imagine a story about love and relationships where actors don't show a single hint of emotions and talk and walk like constipated corpses most of the time. Martin McDonagh has already rediscovered Colin Farrell as a comedian in In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths and it is always nice to see another director picking up on that streak. Ben Whishaw and Aggeliki Papoulia are notably spectacular.As if it isn't enough for Lanthimos to subvert storytelling and acting norms, he seems to play with artistic trends too. If you are familiar with the Lars von Trier's cinematographic experimentation (Antichrist and Melancholia in particular), you will see how Lanthimos uses slow motion and classic music to create a grandiose effect that stands in a hilarious contrast with the event taking place on the screen.The Lobster is another must-watch multilayered witty narrative from the impeccable imaginarium of Yorgos Lanthimos.It went straight to my heart and to my all-time favorite films list.",10,19,34,8 February 2016
Angels & Demons," After all... I enjoyed it!!
","By far, Angels & Demons is better than The DaVinci Code! Still, Ron Howard has repeated some of the latter's mistakes. The action-packed events and the information-stuffed script give no space whatsoever to other factors, such as performance and underlying themes, to arise. It is a fact that a lot of directors face the usual problem of fitting a rich bulky novel into a two-hour movie. However, many of them have managed to overcome such a problem apparently, Howard is not one of them. This leads us to the fact that Angels & Demons' success over The DaVinci Code is attributed to the excellence of the novel itself.Regarding cast and performance, again, I think Tom Hanks is a tragic miscast as Robert Langdon! Hanks is a great actor, and he is one of my favorites, but I just can't see him as heroic symbologist Robert Langdon. Besides, he showed nothing of his acting brilliance, for all he has done in that movie is raising his eyebrows and trying to look astonished all the time! Ewan McGregor, or Camerlengo Patrick McKenna to be honest, I expected more from him! But, I don't want to sound too judgmental, I think this is due to the script's flaws; there wasn't enough space on paper for the extremely important and deeply complicated character of the Camerlengo. Thus, McGregor couldn't fully bring it to life on screen. As for Nikolaj Lei Kaas (the assassin), he successfully and masterfully makes his debut in the American movies' scene, for I think that his performance was really applaudable, reminding me of the terrific performance of Paul Bettany as Silas in The DaVinci Code. Stellan Skarsgård, as Commander Richter, stood out as well.One of the things that I also liked about the movie is the soundtrack. The orchestral symphonies reflect the holiness and grandeur of the setting, and they manage in some scenes to give you goosebumps! The visual and special effects were quite lame for a movie like this. In some shots, things don't seem real at all and you feel as if you are watching a state-of-the-art video game.Finally, Angels & Demons is certainly an enjoyable experience, especially if you are not familiar with the novel, and the twists and turns of the plot.",8,2,5,17 May 2009
Black Swan," The Pursuit of Perfection
","To really appreciate Black Swan, you have to have the soul of an artist to understand the psychological labor that true artists go through in order to produce a 'perfect' piece of art. The movie depicts this process and succeeds in capturing the fine line between art and insanity. Nina (Natalie Portman), an aspiring ballerina, gets the role of her life as the Swan Queen in the universally acclaimed ballet The Swan Lake. Being an inexperienced introvert and a stiff dependent, Nina finds it easy to embody the role of the innocent White Swan but extremely difficult to embody its evil counterpart: the seductive Black Swan. As a result, the show director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), pushes her to dig deeper in herself and discover her own sexuality. In the meantime, Nina is totally obsessed with the new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis), who joins the company and charms everybody with her spontaneity, playfulness, and sexual appeal. Lily becomes everything Nina is missing, everything she wants to be, i.e. the Black Swan!At this point, the story of the ballet intertwines with reality, and Nina's daily life turns into a daily struggle to win the approval of the director by breaking the curse of the White Swan she is trapped in. Nina becomes completely indulged in the ballet that she loses the ability to distinguish between what's real and what's not. Such psychological conflict is beautifully symbolized in Nina's visions and role-giving to people in her life, and in her constant attempts to revolt against and break free from her mother and her meek self, so that she can let the Black Swan take control of her. All for the sake of art.. Perfect Art. The movie is fraught with symbolism and psychological undertones, a trademark of any Darren Aronofsky work, that the average movie viewer probably will not tolerate. Nevertheless, I think this is Aronofsky's masterpiece and his finest so far. His ability to bring such dark and unreachable artistic desires on screen and merge them with visual beauty is stunning! Every scene in the movie is a painting to be studied and taught. Natalie Portman's mind-blowing performance deserved every ounce of the Oscar she won for this role. This girl has it all: talent, charm, beauty, grace, intelligence and maturity. Kunis and Cassel were both playful and charming, being comfortable in their seemingly tailor-made roles. And just to make everything perfect, and leaving me nothing to criticize, Clint Mansell adds his god-like touches to the movie's score turning it into a transcendental audio-visual piece of art.",10,3,7,26 December 2011
Requiem for a Dream," Haunting. Powerful. Disturbing.
","Disturbingly powerful. The name 'Darren Aronofsky' should be the definition of impeccable originality. The man knows how to translate a redundant, overused idea into an audio-visual epic. I'm sure you've seen many movies on drug abuse and how dangerous it is, but never like Requiem for a Dream. The movie takes you down into the lives of four differently motivated drug addicts, showing their experiences through their own eyes so that you would feel every moment of ecstasy and every pang of pain. Ellen Burstyn gave one of the BEST performances I've ever seen in my entire life! And Clint Mansell, as usual, breathed life into the movie with that dramatically unforgettable musical score.",9,1,3,8 January 2012
Finding Neverland," Loved it, but...
","This one was highly recommended by a number of friends. So I watched it and found that it was really worthwhile. However, during the 2-hour view, I had it in my head in a constant comparison with my all-time favorite Big Fish; maybe because they both have the same themes, and almost share the same dreamy world of imagination. However, weighing them both, Big Fish was certainly heavier! I can't really say why... maybe I'm prejudiced to Big Fish because I relate more to it, or maybe because I've seen it first, which makes Finding Neverland a candy-like repetition. I don't really know! However, Finding Neverland is one good movie, and I can't deny it. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet managed to captivate me with their mighty performances (as usual!). The story was so real and dreamy at the same time. Some of the credit must go to Marc Forster as well for creating such a beautiful experience so vividly.",9,0,0,9 April 2010
Inglourious Basterds," I'm not a Tarantino fan.... but I liked it!
","I have never been a Quentin Tarantino fan. That is why I watched Inglourious Basterds after it had been recommended to me more than once. I have to admit I did not hate it altogether; actually, I found Tarantino's comic-like style really enjoyable this time. Tarantino's camera shots are amazing as usual – can't deny that! Moreover, this movie is different from his previous 'rogue' movies because it is based on historical events and real rogues. Plus, I like stories that mess around with history, reshaping and rewriting it, producing another perspective of what could have happened. As for the performance I guess Tarantino knew how to bring the best in all his cast apart from Brad Pitt who I think flunked dramatically as Lieutenant Aldo Raine. As I said, all did a great job but some managed to really stand out; those include Til Schweiger (Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz) and Christoph Waltz (Colonel Hans Landa), especially the latter who literally blew my mind away with his topnotch witty and spontaneous performance!",10,1,3,11 June 2011
Shakespeare in Love," A Larger-than-life Movie!
","Passion. Art. Love. Beauty. All in one movie that will leave you utterly speechless. Shakespeare In Love has by far exceeded my expectations and deservedly topped my all-time-favorite-movies list. I don't know from where to start.. but I certainly know with whom to start; the one and only Joseph Fiennes. Were Shakespeare alive, he would be jumping out of happiness for being depicted with such vigor, heartiness and originality! Fiennes not only has playfully depicted the 17th century dramatist but also added a lot from his own passion-radiating personality - so masterfully and sincerely that you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen as long as he is on. As for the ever-radiant Gwyneth Paltrow, she is literally the sunshine of the movie. Her delicacy and sweetness take over the script and setting and even other actors, and manage to put you in a fairytale-like atmosphere. Geoffrey Rush was more than brilliant, as usual, as the money-seeker Philip Henslowe and hugely added to the comic effect. Roughly, the same can be said about Ben Affleck who was surprisingly good as the self-centered yet kind-hearted actor Ned Alleyn. Queen Elizabeth was originally portrayed by the ever-talented academy-award-winner Judi Dench. She manages to mix comedy with grandeur in her representation of the famous Queen. Although it derives most of the characters from real life, the story is fictional, or at least not proved true. However, it poses a new perspective for regarding history. History, like art, is in the eye of the teller and the listener/viewer. Thus imagination plays the greatest role in relating the events of the story. This will leave you wondering what if this was true?! What if Shakespeare's timeless love sonnets and plays are nothing but the reflection of a larger-than-life romance? The script is beautifully written and the score is heavenly composed. In Shakespeare In Love, everything is carried to perfection so that it could touch every single cord of your heart.",10,3,5,2 October 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," Why didn't I see that before?!!
","Ironically enough, the problem with non-Hollywoodian movies is that you never get to know them unless they win some kind of a top-notch 'Hollywoodian' award. I wonder how many other good non-American movies I've missed due to this monopolizing propaganda. The Secret in Their Eyes deservingly grabbed an Oscar for a Best Foreign Film in 2010. The story of the movie is a quite simple, yet deep, one that touches upon the fine line connecting a love story with a homicide. Both being unfinished, they linger about Counselor Benjamin Esposito's (Darin) life and haunt his memories keeping him stuck in the past. What is really peculiar about this movie is that it delves deep into the most private human emotions: love, passion, loyalty, faithfulness, vengeance.. etc. It is also about the unflinching power of unreconciled memories that can take hold of our lives and control our future.However, the film was not without shortcomings; the tempo was a little bit slow-paced and the events sometimes took some far-fetched turns. The cinematography and direction were outstanding, leaving you with some unforgettable scenes. Moreover, the screenplay was one of the wittiest I've ever seen. Without any exceptions whatsoever, and I totally mean it, the performance was epic! The cast did a great job bringing this heart-piercing story to life. A special kudos should go to Esposito's friend, Pablo Sandoval (Francella), for his smart, funny and witty Woody Allen-like performance.",8,3,4,7 May 2011
127 Hours," Human Will Survive..
","One of the most inspirational survival movies I've ever seen! 127 Hours is based on the amazing true story of Aron Ralston, a canyoneer who was trapped alone for almost five days in a canyon and finally made it out alive. The movie not only depicts this horrifying experience in detail but also gives it a spiritual depth by relating it to Ralston's life. Although the movie lacks action, there is no way you can feel bored; Boyle manages to make the situation that Ralston (James Franco) finds himself in so intimate that it will totally consume you. It will amaze you how far the human will could be pushed and challenged. As for James Franco, honestly I've never liked him but I have to admit his performance was amazing and one of his best so far. Now 127 Hours is certainly my favorite Danny Boyle movie.",8,0,2,13 September 2011
Youth," 'Emotions are all we've got!'
","This one left me emotionally confused. I tried to make sense of how I felt and why I felt this way but eventually surrendered to the fact that sometimes you have to let some emotions sink in without passing them through your mind's filter. As Harvey Keitel's character (Mick Boyle) puts it, 'emotions are all we've got.' The two old friends, Keitel and Caine, look back at their rich and seemingly glamorous lives trying to make sense of how things turned out to be. Their attempts to assign meaning to past events and relationships fail when they realize that everything is slipping through their fingers (their memories and their youth), and all they're left with are emotions.Paolo Sorrentino is known for his penchant for the visual. Youth's story line and underlying themes are visually narrated with some stunning image-music choreography.Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel and Jane Fonda (in this startling cameo) all take the imminent decay of the characters they are playing to the heart and deliver some heart-wrenching performance.",7,0,1,11 August 2016
Zodiac," The 'realest' thriller I've ever seen
","Before watching it, I had no idea who or what the Zodiac is!! which I think played a great part in my fascination with this movie. I expected an ordinary thriller with a lot of killings and many twists and turns, but this one is a lot different, which is something to be expected from a brilliant director like David Fincher. This movie is a piece of real life; it shows that not all cops are geniuses, not all criminals are stupid psycho maniacs, not all what the lead characters think are true, not all crimes are solvable... simply, nothing's certain! I like also how Fincher presented a based-on-true-story thriller without maiming facts and adding the well-known 'comicy' style of nowadays thrillers. Everything in that movie seems morbidly true. Despite that, it's not boring at all; the take-it-easy gripping style of Fincher will keep you tied up to your chair throughout the almost-three-hour picture, leave alone watching Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo and Downey Together.",8,0,0,21 December 2008
Shutter Island," One View Is Just Not Enough
","Could any Scorsese/DiCaprio movie possibly go wrong?! I loved every minute of Shutter Island. The brilliant script is brought to perfection by DiCaprio's exquisite, getting-maturer-by-the-day performance and Scorsese's unfailing ability to entertain both your eye and mind.The movie is a perfect thriller that will have you watch the movie more than once to pick up what you missed and put the pieces together. Even the twists and turns, as they unfold, make the movie richer both story- wise and suspense-wise without sacrificing the verisimilitude. And never think you've got it all after the first viewing, the second and the third, will surprise you even the more and leave you wondering what to believe.Everyone in the movie's ensemble seems to know exactly what they are doing. I don't know whether it's the Scorsese effect or all of them are really good actors. Ben Kingsley is a master of his art as usual. Patricia Clarkson and Emily Mortimer, despite their small roles, flavored the film with some topnotch performance. As for Mr. Ruffalo, he has officially moved from my 'Can't Stand' List to my 'Likable' List.",9,0,2,14 September 2012
Life of Pi," The Universe Inside
","'Krishna opens his mouth, and Yashoda gasps she sees in Krishna's mouth the whole complete entire timeless universe!'The following is a story Pi's mother recounts to him as a kid. The young god Krishna was wrongly accused of eating a bit of dirt. When his foster mother, Yashoda, knows about it, she scolds him and orders him to open his mouth, inside which she sees the whole universe; lands and skies, planets and galaxies, past and future, hopes and fears everything.This religious Hindu story should be kept at the back of your mind throughout the entire film for it sets ups the stage for Pi's life. The movie starts with the adult Pi Patel who narrates to a novelist his own survival adventure; how he survived a violent shipwreck in which he lost his entire family and his father's zoo animals, and how he managed to coexist with a Bengal tiger for weeks on a stranded lifeboat. The story of Pi, originally written by Yann Martel and adapted to screen by David Magee, succeeds in stripping the confusing issue of faith down to its core. Pi, the result of a world which is part secular (the father) and part shyly religious (the mother), represents the modern man with all his anxiety, confusion and questions. The young Pi could feel a greater power controlling the universe even though he could not place or define this power. That is why he became a Hindu, a Christian, and a Muslim, all at the same time.The movie is dense with symbolic cues that will need to be revisited and reconsidered every time you ponder on Pi's adventure. First of all, we are told that the Bengal tiger is called Richard Parker because its original name, Thirsty, was swapped with the name of its hunter in the registers. When young Pi gets attached to Richard, his atheist father feels obliged to prove to him that Richard is merely a beast and that it is not soul that he sees in the tiger's eyes but only a reflection of his own emotions. Whether the tiger had a soul or was only a reflected image of Pi is left to the viewer to decide. Moreover, Pi's adventure in the sea can be interpreted as man's journey through life, full of hopes, hardships, miracles and letdowns. Everything Pi encounters helps in his emotional, spiritual, and intellectual growth. However, what makes Pi different is that he manages to live life and see (and make us see as well!) the universe as reflected inside him.The ending of the film is absolutely brilliant. It gives place for both doubt and belief equally because, as Pi puts it, 'doubt is useful, it keeps faith a living thing. After all, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it is tested.' After the shipwreck, the hypo-narrative (Pi's adventure) gets divided into two parallel, if not opposite, stories; one is miraculous and incredible, and the other is gruesome yet realistic. The adult Pi gives us the freedom to choose between the two because, according to him, both stories entail the same amount of suffering and sacrifice and have the same result and choosing to believe in one of them depends on the person's internal universe. Simply put, in any given moment of your life, you have all the reasons to be happy and you have all the reasons to be sad.. it is you who chooses, and it is you who writes the story. And this is how faith works. This is how God works.Life of Pi is certainly Ang Lee's masterpiece so far; thoughtful direction, celestial cinematography, breathtaking visual effects, and mature and vivid performance by both Suraj Sharma, who masterfully captured Pi's earlier years of confusion and restlessness, and Irrfan Khan who played the adult Pi with sincere, hard-earned maturity and confidence. The film is relatively long, but there is not a single moment you will feel the slightest tinge of boredom throughout this completely immersive experience.Life of Pi is a feast for both the mind and the eye. A definitely must- see.",10,4,8,22 January 2013
The Revenant," All That Went Wrong with The Revenant
","It's the Oscars season hooray! And everyone seems on the lookout for who deserves the ultimate Hollywoodian honor and who is going to go home with a gold Uncle Oscar. I've been avidly following the ceremony for years now, but that doesn't necessarily mean I hold it in the highest regard; everybody knows it's all politics at the end of the day.Today I went to the cinema to watch this year's most talked about film, Alejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant, trying so hard to ignore the two Golden Globes, the 12 Oscars nominations and the 8.3 IMDb rating. To cut things short: I was immensely let down, and here are my reasons why:1) Iñárritu is a genius, there is no doubt about it, but geniuses are obviously not immune to over-inflated ego. The Mexican director has become popular with film critics and moviegoers worldwide for his ability to make films that are both aesthetically and thematically stunning – films that are so beautiful to look at and so touching you could easily relate to. Who would ever forget the heartbreaking realities of Amores Perros (2000) and Babel (2006)? And the surreal worlds of Biutiful (2010) and Birdman (2014)? After those masterpieces, The Revenant looks like a sheer act of muscle flexing. We get it, Iñárritu! You can do magic with your camera; you can take beautiful long shots, you can make a man-bear fight look so goddam real, you can film inexplicable gore and violence like no one has ever done before, yet I was bored to death because I couldn't feel the slightest connection to anything or anyone. The film comes out visually outstanding but cinematically fragile because it lacks the substance that should hold it together. The entire plot is based on a father- son relationship that wasn't developed enough (or wasn't developed at all) for the viewer to emotionally connect with Hugh Glass, the revenant, which made me feel that the whole survival quest was a bit on the absurd side.2) Clichés. Clichés. Clichés! The film is so rife with clichés I actually thought Iñárritu is playing some kind of a joke on us. A die-hard hero, a classic mindless villain, a dead Pocahontas, a wise chief and of course some careless Frenchies. And don't you think the clichés just stop at character level, they run deep to include predictable plots and extremely bromidic lines and dream sequences. I don't mind that the story is a cliché revenge story, it's the treatment that concerns me. The Revenant is basically about a man who wastes two precious hours of our lives looking for another man who killed his son and left him for dead, and when he finally finds him, the evil man's dying words are revenge is no good. The end. That's it, I swear. If you can see something beyond that, please feel free to contact me.3) I don't usually like to dwell on this point in my film reviews but the improbability of the events was pointless and so difficult to ignore. So we have a man who is fatally attacked by a grizzly bear, almost smothered to death, shot at, falls down a waterfall and off a cliff, stabbed and beaten (I hope I didn't forget anything), yet he miraculously survives! I expect to see him in the next Avengers movie.4) Number four is not really a shortcoming but a disaster redeemed. The outstanding performance by all the cast members makes up for the one dimensionality of the roles they play. Domnhall Gleeson and Tom Hardy hit all the right notes with exceptional maturity (even though I thought Hardy's Texan accent was a bit funny, but maybe on purpose?). Both are actually growing on me in a speed of light. DiCaprio was amazing as usual but I don't think this is the performance he should get an Oscar for. I do appreciate all the trouble and the physical pain he had to go through but compared with his other performances I'm sorry Leo, you can do much better. Anyways, if he grabs an Oscar this year, he would still deserve it, retroactively.The music and the sound editing in general were annoying. I would've sufficed with DiCaprio's incessant heavy breathing.. which is equally annoying to be honest.Go watch Cast Away instead. If you have seen it already, watch it again it would still be a more enjoyable experience.",5,13,22,8 February 2016
American Psycho," American Psycho... American Society.
","American Psycho is a movie that digs psychologically in order to hit socially. The story is certainly brilliant and mind-spinning, thanks to Bret Easton's book. American Psycho is about an apathetic successful rich young man, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who suffers from grave psychological disturbances that make him go into killing frenzies. One of the first lines that Bateman says in the movie goes as follows: 'There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there.' These words apparently set the stage for the events to follow in the film. This idea of being an abstraction resurfaces at the end, making things clearer. American Psycho does not criticize Bateman as an individual. Being and abstraction, he stands for all the 1980s yuppies; this class of young gentlemen who nearly had everything: fame, money and success, yet were vain, stupid, materialistic and superficial from the inside, and who also lost touch with their society and humanity. Sharing the same characteristics is beautifully represented in the movie more than once as everybody gets mistaken for somebody else. Thus, since the idiosyncrasies disappear, the whole society manifests itself in one facade-like individual: Patrick Bateman. Bateman is extremely self-conscious; he is obsessed with cleanness, health, looks and fancy clothes, which almost applies to everyone else. Bateman starts having this killing fits in which he murders prostitutes, strangers and even his colleagues in cold blood. However, unlike the common analysis, I tend to believe that these murders are real, but since Bateman is not an individual as I mentioned before, they are committed by the whole society. How he gets away with all his murders and insults people without them responding show that he is a recurrent case... a collective human condition with no material existence. Christian Bale has certainly excelled himself with this hauntingly beautiful performance. To be able to capture the anxiety, rage, vanity and insanity of an entire society and represent them in one character is sheer brilliance and exquisite talent.",8,3,6,26 May 2011
Knowing," Enjoyable... until the last 20 minutes!!
","Brilliant direction, and special and visual effects!!! That what makes Knowing really worth seeing. As for the performance, Cage was as stiff as a wood log and Byrne was overacting all the time. Something else really sucked... the music! The background music had that Spieberg's alien hype all the way, I felt that I'm watching a 70s or an 80s flick. It was completely inadequate to the action-packed events. Concerning the storyline, I think it is really good and will have you at the edge of your seat... up till the last 20 or 30 minutes!!.. when everything goes crazy and inexplicable things happen. That's why in the last part, one can find a lot of plot holes. I didn't also like the mixing of the religious allusions- that gave me the creeps sometimes!!- with scientific fantasies; it tarnished the movie with a quite childish mark. However, I think Proyas did a great job with a quite worn-out but confusing end-of-days idea... leave alone some of the movie's scenes he masterly managed to make unforgettable.",5,1,3,24 May 2009
American History X," Highly overrated
","Totally loved it. But I'm a little bit disappointed I have to admit! The reviews I read prior watching American History X, and the fact that it was ranked one of the best movies of all time made me set the bar really high up. And during my two-hour view I was waiting for that moment when I'll be truly AWED. It didn't come though! I was highly entertained and thought-provoked... but never touched. The movie digs deep into one of the most unsettling problems in the American society (and it makes me think maybe I'd be more touched if I were an American myself!) and materializes its social impact. Director Tony Kaye did a great job shockingly portraying the gruesome and painful outcomes of this vicious circle of hate. However, he heavily depended on melodramatic score and slow-motioned takes and flashbacks to heighten this effect, which, I think, was quite cheesy. The movie is beautifully written, and wonderfully performed. Edward Norton has this magnetic charisma that you can't help waiting for the next scene he'll be in. His performance is naturally flawless. The young Edward Furlong pulled it off brilliantly as well.",8,0,4,5 October 2010
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Not a time-waster at All!
","It was really entertaining and I consider it the best Planet of the Apes movie so far, but I can't go all excited about it as everyone seems to be! The story flows nicely but quite lamely; there is something missing about the development of events that I couldn't really spot. Caesar's transition from friendliness and meekness to anger and rebellion doesn't feel right. Maybe because the process was accelerated in some parts and intensified in others.. I don't really know! The movie again tackles the question of power, putting the master-slave paradigm to test in the hands of a highly intelligent ape who starts questioning his existence and relation to Mankind. There is some amazing performance in the movie, especially that of James Franco and John Lithgow. However, it's funny that the best performance is given by Caesar, played by Andy Serkis who managed to breathe more life into a CGI ape than any of the other cast members showed. All in all, I think Rupert Wyatt did a good job.",6,0,4,15 October 2011
2012," Utterly disappointed!
","Have you seen Independence Day, Armageddon, or The Day After Tomorrow? Then there's no need for you to watch that one, unless state-of-the-art special effects really draw you in! 2012 is a typical apocalyptic movie, adding absolutely nothing to the myriad of movies tackling the same theme. Even the 'moral lesson' that Emmerich forcibly interjected in the movie is cheesy, worn out, and naively delineated. The plot line drops more than once, and it is doltishly patched up; inexplicable events take place, characters weirdly behave, and Jackson Curtis (Cusack) miraculously survives deadly situations! Watching John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Oliver Platt and Thandie Newton was quite amusing,not because of their performance in the movie, but because they are good actors always fun to see on screen. Woody Harrelson and Thomas McCarthy were remarkable though; they managed to really stand out with their rib-tickling yet noteworthy performance.2012 is certainly not a waste of time, but it's not a movie to remember as well.",4,6,10,17 November 2009
The Lives of Others," Compelling.
","A compelling story with some outstanding acting. It relates the atrocities and transgressions exercised by the Secret Police in Eastern Germany back in the 1980s. The thing about this movie is that it might seem dull, lacking the basic thriller elements. However, watching it will have all your senses alerted, story and plot wise. The Lives of Others has all the ingredients of a historical and political movie, a gripping thriller and a heart-piercing drama, cleverly combined all together. Ulrich Muhe was absolutely amazing as the Secret Police agent Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler. His seemingly poker-face and lifeless expressions spoke words and showed emotions a thousand scripts couldn't have possibly expressed. Martina Gedeck stood out as well.",8,1,1,13 July 2011
Room," A Heartfelt Drama in One Room
","A young woman is abducted by a middle-aged man who goes by the name Old Nick and is imprisoned in his backyard shed for six years during which she gives birth to a kid who thinks that the room he grew up in with his mother is the entire universe. But we see none of this. The film opens with the two main characters, Jack (the five-year-old boy brilliantly played by Jacob Tremblay) and his mother (played by the talented Brie Larson) going about their everyday life in the room – sleeping, eating, exercising, playing, reading etc. with occasional visits from the mysterious Old Nick. Upon Jack's fifth birthday, the mother decides that it is about time to get them both out of the room.I won't go into the details of the extremely bold scheme and the mother-son heart-wrenching argument scenes, but they finally do it and they make it out of their prison – a crucial moment that, you might think, will bring about the two characters' happily ever after. However, Room is not a happily ever after story; it is a story about what happens after the happy ending – a story about transitions. The film is divided exactly into two halves: inside and outside the room, two places that are equally confining for Jack and his mother. In the first part of the film when we are trapped inside with the two, we could feel the sense of confinement in mother's eyes but Jack's giggles and jumping around make us feel that the small room is as big as a playground. When we leave the room – an overwhelming moment for both of them – the room's concrete walls are replaced by psychological confinement materialized through personal disappointments and people's judgments.The two main characters are tied by blood but differ drastically in the way they perceive the universe. For the mother, the room is the strange unfamiliar grounds; whereas for Jack, the room is the only universe he has ever known and the outside world is the unfamiliar, intimidating terrain. Despite the change of perspective, the bond mother and Jack share helps them become stronger, reach out to each other and overcome the difficulty of transition. Regardless of the melodramatic undertones, the story shows that it doesn't matter on which side of the wall you're standing because the only walls there are are the ones we build around ourselves and around other people, and that love is the only power that can overcome those walls.The natural chemistry between Larson and Tremblay is phenomenal.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," As simple as life can get!
","Simplicity is the keyword of this movie which tackles many themes such as love, inevitability, individuality, perfection, and mortality. I could easily write a million pages criticizing the movie and explaining the themes, but there's no need to, because what will be written is simply what we face everyday i.e. life!! Some think that it was too long, and I have to admit, I thought that too, but a deeper look made me realize that it was all part of the intended effect; our life sometimes could seem long and boring and insignificant, but by the end of the day we realize that every single person we meet, ever single word we hear or say, and every single look... count. A kudos for David Fincher.",8,3,5,24 May 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Outstandingly unusual.
","Creative. Brilliant. Dreamy. All that and even more. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an extraordinary story of love that goes beyond the limits of time and defies all rules of reality. I loved every second of it and I wouldn't mind watching it over and over again.The movie is about Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), a couple who decide to undergo a memory erasing procedure to forget each other after their relationship goes downhill. Only through this unusual experience do they embark on a journey to discover their true feelings, realizing that forgetting might be the easiest cure for pain but tolerating is definitely the best. The idea is absolutely crazy in an amazing way, and turning it into a moving picture with story, plot, characters and emotional charge must have been a painstaking task. The actual timeline and the dream sequence were craftily interwoven in a way that arises the viewer's curiosity with every passing second, and gradually holds a grip not only of his mind but of his heart as well.Kate Winslet played her character to perfection. She was the sunshine in the movie; her impulsive nature and spontaneous, fun-loving character contributed to the vividness of the story. Jim Carrey gave his lifetime best performance. He was so believable and mature I had to convince myself that this is the same Carrey who plays mainly sappy roles in inane comedies.A million kudoses for Charlie Kaufman's exquisite mind.",10,3,5,28 April 2012
Avatar," However.... a really good movie!
","Certainly loved the dreamy world that James Cameron has beautifully created and masterfully directed!! The art director has done an amazing job; the stunning colors and landscapes will keep your bottom stuck to your seat and your eyes fixed on the screen throughout the almost-three-hour movie. Avatar also has some great performances by Zoe Saldana (she is absolutely sensational as Neytiri!), Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, and Sigourney Weaver.The movie's sole letdown is the story! A cliché that you've probably seen thousands of times before. The brave white man who curiously discovers- and later becomes part of- a less civilized community, influencing and being influenced by them. The story also ponders on other 'cliched' themes such as spiritual courage and the identification of man with nature. However, the plot line, as simple and cheesy as it is, is beautifully drawn and, at some parts, will certainly stir the emotions of the audience.Avatar is one hell of an experience you don't wanna miss!",6,1,3,26 December 2009
The Fountain," An epiphany-like experience
","My second viewing of this hauntingly beautiful movie. Darren Aronofsky is a rare diamond no doubt! Because to be able to create a story that delves deep into the meaning of our existence, and laden it with heavy symbols, then turn it into such sensuous film, definitely requires a lot of genius. The Fountain tackles the idea of life and death as a cycle; from death, life blooms.. just like a fountain. Thus, eternity becomes a possible conception through three parallel stories that finally come together in the end. I hate to think of these stories as past/present/future, although it is indicated they are so. The 'present' is the main plot line which tells the story of Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) who tries to save his dying cancer-stricken wife Izz Creo (Rachel Weisz). Tom does not accept death and thinks of it as a curable disease, something which is reflected in the 'future' world in which Tom sits by a dying tree wishing that he could cure it. This future plot line reflects the present Tom's mentality which evolves and comes to understand the truth with Izzi's death. As for the 'past' plot line, it basically reflects Izzi's point of view; her understanding and acceptance of death and her search for spiritual eternity, just as the Queen's. And the fact that she left this story unfinished to be completed by her husband shows her desire to make him understand and join her in this spiritual eternity, that is why she frequently appeared in Tom's future/mental world to urge him to finish the story.. to understand. The Cinematography was phenomenal that watching the movie felt like having a beautiful dream. Clint Mansell's epic music also helped to accentuate this effect. Rachel Weisz was amazing and angelic as always, and Hugh Jackman gave his 'best' performance so far! I was literally blown away by his overwhelming passion and his love for his wife.",9,1,2,11 April 2011
Mystic River," A good piece of drama.
","A good drama beautifully presented by Mr. Eastwood. The movie ponders on the total randomness of life, and shows that nothing is really forgotten no matter how hard we try or pretend. In my opinion, Sean Penn's performance was mediocre and very artificial. Actually, I think he didn't deserve the Oscar he grabbed! The real hero of this movie was Tim Robbins; such a complicated character and such an amazing performance! Boyle is a vivid example of a man motivated by fear and living in his own world of dreams; all because of a horrible tragedy he has been subjected to as a child. This tragedy plays the role of the ghost that haunts the characters throughout their lives. Some are haunted by fear, others by guilt and deception. Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden did a wonderful job, but I think their characters needed more elaboration to justify their deeds. As for Kevin Bacon, he simply had what it takes!",9,1,1,24 May 2009
The Holiday," What a Holiday!
","Absolutely adorable! Like any romantic comedy, it was anything but realistic. However, it just leaves you feeling happy, no matter what. And as Iris (Kate Winslet) said: 'anything could happen.' As for the cast, what an ensemble that is! How could anyone possibly miss a movie in which Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Cameron Diaz, Jack Black and Rufus Sewell star?! They were all exceptionally funny and beautiful, especially the great Kate Winslet (this woman never ceases to dazzle me). Even Cameron Diaz (I've never been a fan myself) struck me as wackily cute. I think Nancy Meyers did a great job there. If you want to see this one, you'll have to drop down your defenses, stop comparing, and just let the good feeling flow in.",7,2,3,17 December 2010
12 Years a Slave," McQueen Does It Again.
","I've said it before and I'm saying it once again: Steve McQueen is a visual artist in every sense of the word. He fully understands the power of the image and brilliantly exploits that in channeling his message. McQueen's films are not made to entertain (those who watched Hunger and Shame will know what I mean); his films are made to shock and engage. He uses gruesomeness to shock, and visual beauty to engage.12 Years a Slave is shockingly powerful in its adherence to reality and its details. The audience are forced to watch the graphic whipping and torture scenes, and McQueen unapologetically elongates those scenes and strips them of any non-diegetic music so as to deepen their realistic effect. Watching a man hanged to a tree and trying to keep his toes to the ground for a few seconds is an awful thing to watch, and will naturally instigate feelings of pity and sympathy. However, watching the same man with his relentless endeavors to keep standing on his toes for more than 3 or 4 minutes is definitely an agonizing experience for the viewers. The persistence of the silent and still shot invades your comfort zone and forces you to identify with the man.But being gruesome does not mean the film is not beautiful. Aesthetically speaking, 12 Years a Slave is a cinematographic feat. McQueen's visual trademarks are easily spotted (and admired). Each frame is a triumphant work of art; the placement of the camera, the colors, and the mise-en-scene are all done so carefully that I did not mind having those 'McQueeny' still shots all the time. Each frame is a beautiful painting with an elaborate statement.Performance-wise, all actors excelled, even though some of them had really small roles. And of course, Ejiofor and Fassbender were phenomenal (surprise, surprise!). The only thing I could not understand is the presence of Brad Pitt in the film. His character is small but important in terms of plot line, but to have him pull this weird southern accent of his and talentlessly preach about slavery is completely annoying! I believe Pitt was used only for publicity; just another big name on the movie's poster.I don't know why but whenever I write a review on any of McQueen's movies, I end up writing about McQueen himself and his idiosyncratic style (that's how good he is!). Maybe because it is not about what he presents but how he presents it. 12 Years a Slave is a slavery movie but not the usual slavery-is-bad-don't-do-it-again movies. It goes beyond the main theme and takes you by the hand to gruesome/fragile condition of the human soul.",8,2,5,26 November 2013
The Reader," It's all about Kate!
","An emotionally laden drama about romance, guilt and atonement. The story spans over 40 decades bringing together a 15-year-old boy and a 34-year- old woman, connecting their lives with love, secrets and reading. The main controller of events and characters in the film is the Emotion. It just flows subtly through every scene, and every spoken and unspoken word. Consequently, you won't help but look sentimentally upon the socially- tabooed affair between Hanna Schmitz and Michael Berg.Ralph Fiennes and David Kross did a great job as the old and young Michael Berg respectively. However, nothing compares to Kate Winslet's Oscar- worthy haunting and infallible performance! Apart from Meryl Streep, I've never seen an actress who acts her heart out like she does. I don't know at how many Oscars she is going to stop?!",7,0,0,17 January 2012
Inception," Nice, but....
","Can anyone tell me please what this fuss is all about?!! After reading the critics' reviews, I rushed to the movies promising myself an unforgettable night, but after the almost two-and-half-hour view, I was nothing but deeply disappointed!... Not because the movie is bad. Not at all! It was my highly raised expectations that came down to nothing.The idea? Nice, but not new! It was differently treated in dozens of movies before. Treatment? Certainly interesting and catchy even though I think it was pushed a little too far. Plot? Filled with holes that can let a bus through. Direction? quite brilliant I have to admit, Christopher Nolan did a great job here. He managed to turn this could've-been-boring thriller into a dramatic action in which he keeps in touch with the human side of the characters along the way. Another reason behind the success of Inception is the outstanding cast. Leonardo DiCaprio has completely departed from the sissy-like performance of Jack Dawson and has grown into a full-fledged actor to whom I respectfully raise my hat. Marion Cotillard was nothing but truly amazing! Without her, the movie would've certainly flunked. Ken Watanabe, Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy all did a great job as well. All I want to say here is that the movie is surely enjoyable and worth the watch, just don't expect to see a phenomenon!",7,3,6,12 August 2010
WALL·E," You can't help but LOVE Wall-E!!
","Heading straight to may all-time favorite anime movies! Pixar really knows how to make a 'film'!! The people working there proved that it's not about the complicated story or the witty script or the-state-of-the-art graphics, for Wall-E has none of these. Despite that, the movie has it all... the beauty and simplicity of ideas, the humanity of characters, and the pure and genuine emotions. Although the character of Wall-E almost says nothing throughout the movie, it will certainly put you in tears of laughter and pity. Wall-E is a beautiful experience about how communication and love transcend the tangible and embrace the subtle.",9,2,4,6 June 2009
1408," Finally... a horror movie to watch!
","Finally a good horror movie!! I was so reluctant to watch 1408 expecting a usual, gory, deformed-monster-running-after-a-blonde-chick movie. Nevertheless, I'm glad I was let down. The movie is based on a Stephen King short story, which pretty much explains the refined sense of horror. The story tackles fear in its most basic and instinctual forms, playing on the psyche of the human mind and soul. Hotel rooms, as mentioned in the movie, are creepy by nature, not to mention the notorious, haunted ones. However, to use the 'haunted place' theme in a 21st-century drama is quite a challenge. That's why giving it a psychological depth was a smart move. I never considered John Cusack more than a 'cute' actor, and watching him in a great horror movie like this one left me confused. He played his role naturally and well, but not well enough to blow my mind away. I give it 4 stars with a clear conscience.",8,1,2,1 November 2011
Vanilla Sky," Wonderful! Just keep Cruise out of the way
","One of the inexplicably underrated movies. Based on the ratings and reviews, I started watching Vanilla Sky reluctantly knowing that I would definitely be disappointed. However, and to my surprise, I was totally awestruck by the smart, dreamy story, the brilliant direction, and the out-of-this-world cinematography.The only letdown though (and the reason behind the two missing stars in the rating) is Tom Cruise's stagy performance. He completely missed out on the soul of the character he is impersonating and turned it into a phony. I understand that David Aames is supposed to be shallow and irresponsible and that the movie is his journey towards self-realization and maturity. The point is that Cruise's overtly theatrical performance and overacting (to stress the character's clumsiness) detached me and kept reminding me that I'm watching a movie.Still I have to watch the allegedly superior Spanish original (Abre Los Ojos) to make a better judgment, but I think Cameron Crowe did a wonderful job adapting this one.",8,1,3,16 January 2013
Trainspotting," Hyped!
","McGregor's all-time best performance and Boyle's most hyped movie. Trainspotting precisely captures the spirit of the age through tracing the lives of four heroin-addicted Scottish friends, depicting their ups and downs, and their struggle to come clean and start a new life. The movie is highly graphic and quite shocking I have to say, but this somehow corresponds with the gravity of the experience itself that Boyle has brilliantly and vividly conveyed to the audience in fluttering stages: the absence, the denial, the realization, the struggle, the relapse... etc. The film doesn't lecture or blame; it doesn't treat drug use as an individual case but as a societal phenomena that has everything to do with the atmosphere back then. Besides McGregor's, Robert Carlyle's role as Begbie was remarkable as applause-worthy as usual.",7,1,3,13 September 2011
Before Sunrise," Ethereal!
","Never thought that watching two people talking for almost two hours would be that absorbing! The heart-felt, naturally flowing conversation between Jesse and Celine, tackling a wide range of topics including politics, love, death.. etc., sheds light on human communication in its most engaging and subtle forms. Also, the transiency of this encounter adds up to the dreamy atmosphere shaped by the beautiful setting and the unmistakable chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Their performance was extremely natural and soulful that I actually caught myself smiling foolishly during a number of scenes. Do NOT miss it. It's a memory you would like to keep forever.",9,1,2,7 January 2013
Amélie," Spirit-lifting..
","Another one that deservedly goes straight to my top-movies list! A soul- refilling experience that restores your faith in life and people... a reality check of life's little pleasures. Audrey Tautou played Amelie to perfection that I can't really digest her performance in any other movie; she is and will always remain the doe- eyed, innocent and lovable Amelie to me. The rest of the cast are quite perfect for their roles as well. There isn't much to be said about the movie which traces the life of a simple 23-year-old French waitress with a wild imagination; however, each and every detail counts and adds something to this colorful visual painting and the experience as a whole. Direction and cinematography are simply beautiful! One more thing: Yann Tiersen's extremely becoming and salient music is like God's final touches on earth! Funny, gripping and spirit-lifting, this is a movie you will never get tired of watching over and over again.",10,6,11,8 September 2011
The Truman Show," An existential masterpiece
","Exceptionally genuine story with many underlying thought-provoking ideas. On one level, you can think of this story as an attack against an inhumane, consumerist, media-controlled society where everything is to be sold and benefited from, even human lives. On another level, the story is nothing but an existential pondering on the man-god relationship. Truman represents the once helpless, mind-controlled man who gradually starts to break free by pushing the limits of his reality's already given axioms. Some may not like this saying it represents a breaking away from god (represented by Christof, the show director), but I think it just encourages man to think outside the box and pushes him to refuse whatever reality imposes upon him... to, simply, unleash his imagination. Jim Carrey did a great job, but the one who really blew my mind away was Ed Harris with his extremely grand and mature performance.. I just couldn't take my eyes off him!",9,0,1,9 May 2011
Looper," A Sci-fi Triumph.
","I'm not a big fan of sci-fi movies, not to mention those about time- traveling.The above mentioned statement was definitely refuted by Looper! Reasons?! One: The movie is not made for action buffs. There's a story -a good one- that controls the plot line and hinders it from becoming a mundane action movie. So you won't stumble upon forced scenes of 'visually stunning' crashes and explosions, and others of unnecessary shooting and chasing. Everything in the story is taken care of, even the tiniest details (that would make you want to watch the movie more than once). Despite the futuristic setting the possible mind-fuzzing plot holes (but isn't it the case with all time-traveling movies?!), Looper is a story about the 'human'; egoism that turns into selflessness, and anger that turns into understanding.Two: Joseph Gordon-Levitt is unbelievable! Had I known that that kiddo from '3rd Rock from the Sun' would turn into such an unquestionable talent, I wouldn't have missed an episode. Levitt plays the role of Joe, a hit-man who kills criminals sent from the future until, one day, he realizes that his target is his future self (played by Bruce Willis). Levitt managed to brilliantly imitate Willis's voice tone and facial expressions without losing his powerful presence in the process. And it's not sex appeal I'm talking about here! I'm talking about a pure talent that matures right before our eyes with each new movie. As Bruce Willis... well, he was just Bruce Willis! Levitt, Emily Blunt, Noah Segan, and the 6-year-old Pierce Gagnon are the real stars of the movie.Three: Aided by an out-of-this-world cinematography, Rian Johonson did a great job directing the film. His slow-motioned shots, character close- ups, flashbacks and mise-en-scene accentuate the human core of the story, backgrounding everything else.Watch it.",8,0,3,10 November 2012
Hacksaw Ridge," The Brutal Mel Gibson Is Back
","If you are reading this review you have probably seen The Passion of the Christ (2004) or at least heard of it and the controversy it stirred over the gruesome brutality Mel Gibson unabashedly portrays on screen. For obvious reasons, the film could not wear the 'true story' badge that, 12 years later, Hacksaw Ridge (2016) proudly does. This time, Gibson takes his Christ to World War II to tell the modern-day miracle of American corporal Desmond Doss, a religious and peaceful young man who despite his refusal to bear arms or commit any act of violence, saves the lives of 75 soldiers in his division during the Battle of Okinawa.The film features an incredibly diverse cast; Andrew Garfield, Hugo Weaving, Sam Worthington, Rachel Griffiths, Luke Bracey and Vince Vaughn, all pushed to limits I never thought they would reach. Who would have thought that the sweet boy-next-door Peter Parker has been carrying so much unnoticed potential? He may not look like the real Desmond Doss at all, but his innocently childish face renders the purity of Doss's character, and his emotionally fierce performance conveys the vigor of his faith. However, the person whose presence is felt the most during the 140-minute-long movie is Mr. Gibson himself; his brutal and raw energy becomes the moving force behind every single shot. While watching the film, I caught myself unconsciously clenching my body in a fetus position as a way to fend off the violence on the screen. Gibson's violence is not the gory slaughterhouse kind that invests in feelings of disgust (that never gets me anyway); it is violence that brings our physical and human vulnerability to unprecedented proximity – he brutally invades the bubble of our reality to bring our insides out for everyone to see meaningless, absurd, and vicious as they are.Although it has been described as a 'religious bomb,' the way I see it, Hacksaw Ridge preaches faith not religion. I am well aware that Mel Gibson is an extremely religious individual, and I mean it dogmatically and aesthetically. Like it or not, you've got to respect him for his discipline as a director and his courageous indifference to Hollywood standards. In a time where miracles are ridiculed and our sole idea of heroes is sexy bodies in spandex suits whose superpowers are measured by how much damage they can inflict, Gibson shows us a real hero whose only superpower was his faith – a real hero who only wanted to save lives all lives!For those who could not understand his message the first time, Gibson is saying it again, louder and in a much more mature voice: we need to jump into the very heart of violence to really understand the powerful nature of love.",9,4,8,18 December 2016
Macbeth," All Hail, Kurzel! All Hail, Fassbender!
","In this postmodern rendition of William Shakespeare's Macbeth, Justin Kurzel excels as a dashing experimentalist and Michael Fassbender gives a performance of a lifetime claiming the tormented hero utterly his own.The problem with adapting a Shakespearean drama is that it has probably been read, performed, interpreted, represented, and redefined a gazillion times before, and to think you can positively contribute to the huge, already existing Macbethian discourse is an extremely challenging endeavor. Moreover, your audience have the upper hand; they know the story and almost all the lines by heart and could academically lecture you on the tiniest of details. But this didn't seem to dishearten Australian director Justin Kurzel from adopting a f*ck-it-I'm-gonna-do-it-my-way-whether-you-like-it- or-not attitude to carry on with this risky business. Kurzel made some cinematic decisions that he knew he would most likely be crucified for (already many film critics didn't miss a chance to do so as soon as the film was released); nevertheless, his dark, bloody, visually overwhelming adaptation shocked me but with no doubt satisfied me on every possible level.The visuals play the major part in setting the film's tone and ambiance, and you can call Kurzel's shots overtly pretentious and unrealistic all you like, but what's wrong with that? The film wears the badge of pretense proudly. Isn't Shakespeare's sophisticated language pretentious? Kurzel uses his images as a poet uses words and translates Shakespeare's poetic brilliance into emotionally engrossing visuals, almost to an orgasmic effect – I didn't want some of the long shots to go away because they were so consuming and beautiful to look at. Kurzel is not ashamed to use visual pastiche by borrowing elements from Frank Miller and Zack Snyder and, consequently, turning Macbeth into the most unlikely comic hero of our time.However, if I ever choose to call the film a 'contemporary' adaptation of Macbeth, the visuals would not be the only reason. The screenplay adds something uncannily ominous to the Shakespearean melodrama that directly pertains to modern consciousness. The stress on meaningless violence, brutality and war brings to memory recent events of killings and decapitations. Also, how children are represented as agents of death and threat is a colossal point of departure from the original text. The film opens with a shot of a dead child and a few seconds later we realize it is Macbeth's son's funeral. The infamous three witches are accompanied by a preternaturally looking little girl. A boy who gets killed during war becomes the recurrent apparition that encourages Macbeth to kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth sees a waking vision of her dead child stained with blood. Banquo's son becomes the threat that lingers after the film ends. Children have always been the literary epitome of innocence and subverting this image to the extreme opposite to express fear, guilt and menace is a relatively modern concept. This kind of thematic distortion is reflected in the narrative's time line which disruptively keeps moving forwards and backwards to add to the overall sense of confusion and distortion.Now let's talk acting.Usually, playing Hamlet, Othello or Macbeth is any actor's dream opportunity to toot their horns for a while. Few are those who do away with the generic melodramatic performance and play those characters with regard to the unique perspective of the work in question. Those are the ones I call smart actors and Michael Fassbender is definitely one of them. This Irish-German talent has read the subtext of his role and fully understood Kurzel's vision that his Macbeth reveals a new dimension of the iconic tragic hero I have never seen before. Fassbender's Macbeth is a Macbeth of postmodern proportions; he is no longer the beloved noble hero with one tragic flaw that brings about his demise, but a hero with many opposites. He is attractive yet most of the time covered in dirt and blood (physically and figuratively). He is gentle but in a cruel, detached way. He aspires to build only to destroy. I got the feeling that this Macbeth is not driven by blind ambition but by vengeance and a lurking desire to ruin and deconstruct a universe that has betrayed him – the opening funeral scene gives us a glimpse of how he came to be like that.Fassbender is very much in control of his emotions that not in one scene did I feel like something has been exaggerated or played down. The Macbeth I know goes through a journey of self-loathing and regret that leaves him a total wreck; on the other hand, Fassbender's Macbeth is already disillusioned and wrecked beyond repair. You can tell how dark his inside is from scene one, something which makes him all the more intimidating and incomprehensible. I left the cinema truly wondering what kind of pain and darkness Mr. Fassbender had to summon up from his soul to play that part (sounds melodramatic I know, but I really mean it).Two other people who are equally stunning are Marion Cotillard and Sean Harris. Cotillard has both the innocence and the venom to play Lady Macbeth to perfection, and Harris, with enough maturity and experience up his sleeves, turns the nondescript Shakespearean Macduff into an emotionally and physically powerful character that stands out as Macbeth's antithesis.One final player that invisibly contributes to this harmonious equation and should never go uncredited is the gripping music. Composed by Jed Kurzel (Yup, Justin's brother), the film's original score weaves the ominous atmosphere into existence and completes Macbeth's dark world. Just listen to the first 10 minutes of the soundtrack and you will feel that the music is literally mourning and wailing over Macbeth's eventual destiny.By all means, go watch it and leave your prejudices at the movie theater's door.",9,0,4,8 February 2016
The Great Gatsby," Fitzgerald Passes It Over to Luhrmann The 'Great' Great Gatsby.
","It's usually on the second viewing of any film that I turn from the innocent audience member into the scrutinizing critic. I save the first viewing for total absorption in the movie. My first viewing of The Great Gatsby was quite an euphoric experience. Nevertheless, I don't expect everyone to love the movie the way I did because at the end of the day it's a matter of tastes and interests. All I'm trying to do here is to give you some reasons why I think Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is an exceptional film.Let's start from F. Scott Fitzgerald's book. Most people have read the novel at some point in their lives. The Great Gatsby stands as a literary landmark in the history of American literature because it not only incarnates Fitzgerald' smart and swift style but also levels harsh criticism against the American highlife in the early twentieth century and iconically presents the complexity of the human psyche. Whether you like or hate the novel, do not let your judgment transform to prejudice, because Luhrmann's adaptation is a unique work of art that uses its literary source merely as a preliminary structure. That's why I will not get into useless comparisons and contrasts.The film has the unmistakable, authentic stamp of Baz Luhrmann an audio-visual feast for the senses. The extraordinarily picturesque quality of the film gives the story a visual edge that doesn't exist in the original text. Luhrmann's exuberant camera movements and his use of luscious colors and extravagant visual techniques create a sensuous atmosphere and succeed in conveying the lavish lifestyle of the American upper-class. Regarding the music (which I believe is not less important than direction, performance.. etc.), Luhrmann follows his genius habit of mashing up modern music and customizing it to old settings. In The Great Gatsby, his musical choices are BRILLIANT in the sense that they cover a wide range of genres including jazz and hip-hop (I never thought that one project would bear the names of both Fitzgerald and Jay Z!). The songs fit the film and its themes perfectly. They also give the story human depth and help in extending the movie horizontally by relating the mad 1920s to our 21st century. Honestly, the soundtrack needs a review of its own. Having a character of their own and contributing to the significance of the story, Lurhmann's image and music both join hands in fully engaging the audience's senses and hearts.Leonardo DiCaprio was outstanding! Do I need to say more? The guy never seizes to surprise me with his ever-maturing acting skills and his great selectivity (I still can't believe he's the same Jack Dawson I used to despise). Not many actors are capable of choosing their roles that wisely. In the film, DiCaprio breathes life into Fitzgerald's tragic hero and manages to capture all his charm and misery. Similarly, Joel Edgerton stands out as the oppressively dominating Tom Buchanan. As for Carey Mulligan (playing Daisy), I do believe she is a beautiful and talented actress; however, I don't think she was the right one for the role. She shows an overacted emotional involvement that contradicts with her character's deeds. The rest of the cast were definitely lovely.Back to Luhrmann, I believe that he deserves more credit for his bold choices and his ability to defy all the snobbish voices that frown upon modern adaptations of canonical literary works. His first adaptation, Romeo+Juliet, made his point clear. His second, The Great Gatsby, sets his own cult.Again, I don't expect anyone to love the film the way I did. But for me, a good film is the one that makes you hate going back to reality after watching it... the one that makes you wish it lasted a bit longer. Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby is definitely one.",10,10,15,23 June 2013
Atonement," The perfect Atonement.
","A quite faithful adaptation of Ian McEwan's most acclaimed novel Atonement. Christopher Hampton took the liberty to make some changes but they did not, in any way, affect the story and its tragic beauty. The direction and cinematography are out of the world! Joe Wright used his camera to perfectly communicate the unspoken words and the emotional intensity of the events to the audience. I felt totally absorbed in the scenes. Both Wright and Hampton managed to overcome the difficulty of turning words into visuals, especially when it comes to a novel that mainly deals with inner thoughts and personal perspectives.Although I am not a big fan of either Keira Knightley or James McAvoy, I have to admit that their natural presence on the screen breathed more life into the story. Moreover, Saoirse Ronan's mature performance as the young Briony foreshadows a great talent in the making.I also fell in love with the music score from the very first ten minutes! Kudos for Dario Marianelli.",9,1,2,20 January 2012
V for Vendetta," V for Vigorously Brilliant!
","First reaction: WOW!... Second reaction: Why in hell haven't I seen that before?!!... Third reaction: Why did it have to end? I want see it one more time... Fourth reaction: This will unquestionably head to my all- time favorite movies list.It has been a really long time since I gave a movie the ten stars without second thoughts. And with all those crappy and disappointing movies around, I thought I'd never do it again. Rare are those movies that leave such an impression on me and result in this lingering feeling of enthusiasm. I know, to some people, I might be overrating, but this is exactly my idea of how a perfect movie should be.I have to admit I was let down knowing that the Wachowskis are the moving force behind this project (I've never been a fan of The Matrix and never will be!) but hell with my prejudices! They have succeeded in turning V from just an impressive comic character to an international, timeless symbol of revolution. The setting of the movie is a futuristic Britain, but the practices of the oppressive government (that strongly reminds me of Orwell's Big Brother) pretty much resembles the practices of all oppressive governments in history. This leaves you wondering: Are the people in power really that stupid? When will they ever learn that peoples cannot be controlled?James McTeigue did a great job in keeping the movie as symbolic as possible to universalize the experience. The film is not engaged in details; the focus is always on the consequences of the events, not the events themselves. That is why scenes related to the past are repeatedly juxtaposed with scenes from the present so that they would acquire new meanings every time they are shown on the screen (an example is V coming out from the fire in Larkhill). The editing relies heavily on juxtaposition also to stress the unmistakable tone of duality in the movie; fear is juxtaposed with belief, past with present, fire with water, oppression with freedom... etc, there are certainly no gray areas. In addition, the cinematography retains this 'unreal' symbolic effect by using colors that leaves the impression of watching an animated comic book. McTeigue's shots and camera movements are definitely breathtaking - the guy knows what he is doing, without doubt! I also like the fact that the Wachowskis and McTeigue insisted on the anonymity of V, despite the Hollywoodian nagging urge for final revelation.Hugo Weaving.. Hugo Weaving! How can I possibly love him more?! In V for Vendetta, he has proved that a good actor does not even need a face to perform a role. How did he make me 'see' every facial expression and read his eyes from behind the mask?! I have no idea! It is not just his expressive body language I'm talking about, there was more to it; he character of V radiated a certain aura of grandeur mixed with rebellion and playfulness you can never miss. Hugo Weaving... RESPECT. As for Natalie Portman, she was as great as always, no question about it.Movies like this one adds up to your life experience, even if you are not appreciative of cinema as art. Watch it, people!",10,3,5,23 December 2012
