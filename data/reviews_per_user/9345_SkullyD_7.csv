Alien 3," Should've died before it could breed.
","Alien 3 is by far the bleakest, dullest, most brutal chapter of the 'Alien' saga. The film establishes it's despairing tone in it's first scene. Newt, Ripley's cute little sidekick from 'Aliens' is killed off before the 'directed by' credit appears. As if killing off a 12 year old because she isn't conducive to your plot wasn't enough, the film goes on to have little Newt brutally sliced open in a grim autopsy scene. Sadly, it's the only scene in which Sigourney Weaver emotes at all. I'm guessing she checked out when she realized how bad this film was going to be. The remainder of the film is spent talking about events in the other films, or the back- stories of characters who serve no ultimate purpose. The Alien is loose in the ship all this time (it comes out of a dog this time. This scene is pretty brutal and depressing too.) but doesn't do much until the film has already run out of gas.That brings me to another problem: The Alien itself. It's the same basic xenomorph, but it walks around on four legs like a dog. OOOH scary! Early CGI effects are used to the detriment of the creature. CGI was limited at this time, but the real problem is that it strips the creature of all menace. The original alien was frightening because of how slowly it moved, giving the impression of some kind of intelligence. This alien is all bark and no bite. Maybe they shouldn't have had a dog for the host body. duh.David Fincher has gone on to direct some great films. You can feel him trying to make things work, but either the studio interfered too much, or the script was just that bad, or maybe Fincher just hadn't found his footing yet. Whatever it was, this monster should've been killed before it spawned and gave us Alien:Resurrection, and two AVP movies.",1,65,76,23 November 2008
Akira," One of the greatest films ever.
","Akira, is not only a great example of what good Anime can be, but is also a great film. I would stack it against live action sci-fi epics like Star Wars and Blade Runner. While I personally think Ghost in the Shell was better animated, Akira's fury and brutality make it a film which you cannot simply watch on a superficial level. I read a review which said Akira was 'ugly.' Yeah, it is ugly. It's meant to be ugly. The beauty of the animation is how gritty it is. How it takes the Utopian vision of the future depicted by numerous bad sci-fi movies and sprays graffiti on it's pristine walls. The essence of Akira is the ugly side of teen culture and supposedly 'enlightned' social philosophy.Akira is not the first or last film to make us squirm for a reason. A Clockwork Orange used violent and sexually charged images to show the possible future of suburban youth. Schindler's List made us cringe at the graphic depictions of Auschwitz, so that we would remember what happened there.Akira's plot centers around young Tetsuo, a street punk who plays second banana to his bike gang's leader, childhood friend Kaneda. Tetsuo is subjected to military experiments which unleash his dormant psionic abilities, and also cause him to grow increasingly paranoid and angry. Tetsuo becomes determined to discover who 'Akira' is and why some of the other test subjects seem to believe Tetsuo is Akira reincarnated. As Tetsuo's power grows he becomes increasingly powerful, leading him to a violent confrontation with both Kaneda and the military.In the end, the message of Akira is that humankind must be aware of the dark side of progress. The power of Akira is within everyone but is dangerous when misused. Much like the atom bomb, which the film makes reference to, this power can destroy cities and end millions of lives if it ends up in the wrong hands. Considering what our nuclear weapons did to Japan in the 1940's, and considering Japan's commitment to not manufacture weapons of war, the anti-nuke statement of the film is apparent and is one which it begs us not to ignore.",Null,1,3,6 April 2007
The Fifth Element," An underrated brilliant film
","If you take Luc Besson's 'The Fifth Element' at face value, you will be disappointed. This is not a sci-fi epic or a summer action blockbuster. One one level the film has more in common with Noir than sci-fi. Yes, it may be set in the far future but it has Noir sensibilities. The grizzled, chain-smoking Korbbin Dallas is the archetypal Noir protagonist. He gets roped into the whole 'save the world' thing by other forces. He has no great ambitions at the onset of the film. On another level, the film is a parody of overly pompous sci-fi flicks like 'Star Wars.' Besson is one of few directors to understand that sci-fi can and should have humor. Part of the cult status of 'Firefly' was due to it's sense of humor and irony. On a third level, it is a romance. The real arc of the story is Korbbin finding 'the perfect girl.' In the end, Korbbin can't save the world without the woman he loves. Despite all his knowledge of weapons and spacecraft, only love can vanquish evil. That's a beautiful sentiment I fear is lost on cynical American audiences and critics. The film was huge in Europe, which solidifies my theory that Europeans just have better taste. If you've watched this once, I'd recommend a second viewing. Repeated viewings of this film reveal a brilliant artistic visual style, a poignant anti-war statement, a sentimental love story and a biting satire. It's sad this film has been so maligned by critics and ignored by audiences.",7,0,5,25 March 2007
Wanted," One of the best action films I've seen since The Matrix
","If you're one of the many IMDb posters who hate this movie, then I can only assume you have no imagination, or you're just too uptight and stupid to appreciate something that dares to bend the rules as WANTED has done. Realism is out the window within the first few minutes of the film, which features some very impressive stunt work and some unique twists on typical action shots. But this film isn't really about realism. It's a cinematic treat that takes near orgasmic pleasure in it's beautifully crafted action sequences. Best of all, you can actually tell what's going on in the fight scenes. There are no traces of sloppy camera work masquerading as authenticity or documentary- style filming.The movie never feels weighted down by it's grim subject matter. It's buoyed by subversive humor aimed at 9-5 stiffs, cheating girlfriends, bitchy bosses and the modern, emasculated man. In fact, the whole film is more of a treatise on not being anyone's bitch than it is about saving the world by killing people.I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and sorely disappointed by the close-mindedness of a very vocal handful of IMDb reviewers. I feel sorry for you, trapped in your world were everything obeys the laws of physics and nothing makes you sit back and say 'Holy s---! I've never seen that before!'",9,0,4,5 December 2008
Taken," A gripping, emotionally-charged thriller.
","The premise of 'Taken' seems like a pretty standard kidnapping thriller. What elevates this film is a brilliant Liam Neeson, who portrays an ex-black ops or CIA agent (it's never really clear) struggling to connect with his teenage daughter and the emasculation of retirement. When his daughter goes missing on a trip to Europe, he gets a chance to kick some ass again. But that's not the point of the story. Neeson's performance is fueled by desperation. Every minute he's delayed, he could lose his daughter to the European sex-trafficking circuit. It's this sense of urgency that drives this film forward and twists the viewer's stomach in knots. That's not to say the film doesn't provide some truly exciting action sequences, and there are some great visceral moments when Neeson takes on the bad guys. But what makes this film truly stand out is it's heart. Thank Luc Besson, who wrote the script, for injecting some humanity into all the thrills. His writing, coupled with Neeson's performance, combined with a very timely subject matter (human trafficking) and you have the makings of a great thriller.",8,1,2,24 March 2009
Up," A dazzling, inventive and moving film for all ages.
","Two very unexpected things happened to me while viewing 'Up.' First, I cried. I actually found myself misty-eyed over an opening set piece in which our hero meets, marries and loses his wife to old age. There is no dialogue in this sequence. The entire story is told in images and music. I had no expectation of being so moved by a 'kid's movie.' The second unexpected thing that happened to me? I grinned with delight. As our hero lifted off into the sky in his floating house, held aloft by thousands of balloons, I had to resist the urge to squeal like a small child. The scene was so well animated, and the idea seemed so inspired, it was as if every shred of cynicism I had about movies was vaporized. 'That's right, movies CAN be magical!' I thought. 'Up' will dare you to enjoy the movies the way you did as a child. It will also remind you that kid's movies can have substance and still entertain young, easily distracted minds. Pixar has somehow managed to produce nothing but quality films over the past decade, despite being powered by a multi-billion dollar corporation most associate with overzealous commercialism.",10,3,7,1 June 2009
A Clockwork Orange," Brutal, shocking and ingenious.
","I will warn you. 'A Clockwork Orange' makes no apologies. Its violence is brutal, its nudity graphic. But even more provocative is the fact that the film makes you care about a character who is essentially the villain of the story. Alex DeLarge, played with aplomb by Malcom MacDonald, is a spoiled, heartless, immoral bastard. Alex enjoys making other people suffer. He shows no remorse as he beats and old drunk, rapes a writer's wife or violently bludgeons a woman to death with a ceramic phallus. He seems disappointed in being sent to prison, but never sorry. When Alex undergoes behavioral conditioning is when we really begin to feel sorry for him. He's forced to watch scenes of sex and violence which, thanks to drugs, make him feel sick. He develops a physical aversion to both of his favorite pastimes, but there is no inner change. Alex is released from prison following his treatment and finds that he is no longer welcome. his parents have rented his room to a stranger, his old gang have become police officers who beat and nearly drown him and he is plagued by suicidal thoughts. Eventually, Alex attempts suicide. He lives. To avoid embarrassment, the government undoes his conditioning and bargains with him to keep his mouth shut. In the end, we're left to wonder who the real villain is; Alex, or the system which has spawned him. The film offers no pontification of this question. The viewer must decide; is 'badness' a choice or an inborn quality? And ultimately the question becomes: Is man basically good or basically evil?",9,1,3,25 March 2007
