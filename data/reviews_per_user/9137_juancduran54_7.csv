Scarface," This is the gangster film.
","'Scarface' is an absolutely masterpiece;it's the only gangster film ever made that shows the real life of them (the gangsters). In this film you don't see the usual stereotypes about this theme (like in 'The Godfather','Billy Badgate',etc); you see the real gangsters;they aren't people like ice ;they are like you and me; with the difference (not in my case) that them lives have been very hard when they were young ,and that made them much harder than any other person,and finally they join the Mafia,why?, because they have learned in them lives that be a 'nice and good' person don't work;them lives have learned them that being a 'son of a bitch' help much more to have a wealthy life.If you haven't had a hard life you won't understand it ,but if you has had a hard life (like me),you will understand what I'm talking about.Of course,this don't justify them acts;the people the gangsters kill (with drugs or bullets)aren't the ones that made them lives very difficult before,but what happen is that they feel nearly all the rest of the world(except them loved persons),aren't anything ;are like stones or chairs.So,if you want to see a film that shows the life of the real gangsters (without stupid stereotypes) ,see this masterpiece.",10,1,1,8 December 2000
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The weakest film ever made.
","This film is ,without a doubt , the weakest film of the history. It is the type of film that win an Oscar; nothing in the film is credible, the full film try to make believe that the world is full of good people, and that you can believe in mankind, because mankind is 'natural born good'.That is the message of the film, and it try to make believe children in that great lie,and latter that children won't know how to face off the real world ,because it is absolutely different that what they learn in films like this...In the film appear bad characters , but only some of them , trying to make believe children that the world is like that: full of good people,only with some bad people.I think  is dangerous for children to believe such as stupid things like that ones...they won't know what to do in the real world , and they will suffer a lot.",1,12,43,21 November 2000
American Beauty," This is the real American society.
","'American Beauty' is one of the most realistic films I have seen ;it's the only film ever made that shows the American society like it is ;absolutely disturbed.I know the film has funny moments ,but that don't mean the film is a comedy;that moments are there for made the view of the film less hard.The characters the film shows are absolutely reals;probably you think that aren't reals ,but I can say you (I have been there) ,that the Americans are like this film shows.If you haven't been there you won't agree with me, but if you have been there you will it.Of course,that don't mean that all the Americans are crazy,but I can say you that probably most of them are it.Why America is the industrialized country with more rapes and murders?;because most of them are like the characters of this film;of what you think is the cause of it?. I love this movie for a lot of reasons (not only the last one);it has incredible performances ,over all the one by (what an incredible actor!!),Kevin Spacey,the story is funny and serious at the same time (something really difficult to do),and you finally has the impression of that you has been looking at a real home (not at the usual home of the American films;full of stereotypes).So, if you want to know how the real Americans are ,see this great film.",10,0,0,9 December 2000
Aliens," simply, the best film of the history
","i have seen 'aliens' 6 times and what i can say is that is impossible to do a better film...simply impossible . i am sure that never will be done a better film . if somebody thinks this film is not good , he don't know what he is saying . this film has all somebody can wish to see in a non romantic film ;the tenssion never stop from the begining to the end ; sigourney weaver is the best actress of the history and a lot of things more;sigourney must have won the oscar in 1987, i really don't know who won it , but i don't need to know it ; i never have seen a better actress or actor in a film , and this is because is impossible ...maybe somebody can think i haven't seen much films , but i can say i have seen probably more than 7000 , and none of them was better,simply because what i said before ; it is impossible to do a better film than +'aliens'.",10,1,2,30 October 2000
Schindler's List," A great film.
","This film is , without doubt of be wrong , the only 'serious' film made by Spielberg (not for people without brain).It is one of the most human films ever made  ,it is hard like the life is (exactly the opposite of all the other Spielberg's films),and show a great true :the mankind is bad by nature ....I'm sure that any other country would have done what Germans did,why?,because every human have the evil inside him...that's the great true about mankind...But there are good persons in all the places of the world, persons like Oscar Schindler ,who loose all his money saving innocent people of the worst possible die: in a extermination camp (the real name of camps like Auchswitz or Dachau ;not 'concentration camps'). The reason why I enjoy so much this film ,it is because make me believe a great true: not all the mankind is bad.",9,13,20,21 November 2000
The Insider," An extraordinary film.
","'The Insider' is a masterpiece.I only saw it because Al Pacino was in it;the theme really wasn't very interesting for me(I though that was the usual 'political-correct' film against tobacco),but then came the big (big!) surprise;I found myself seeing an incredible good film.It has wonderful performances by(of course)Al Pacino ,Russel Crow,Christopher Plummer and Diane Venora.It's one of that strange cases when the theme of the film isn't very interesting , but the film is so well made that you enjoy it like if it would have the most interesting theme possible.Michael Mann shows that is one of the best directors;making an absolutely absorbing film ,starting with a non much interesting theme ;it has nearly hypnotic moments (the most of them when Al Pacino and Russel Crow are having a phone conversation).It's so absorbing that the 2 hours and a half of it seems like lees than 1 hour.I can't say what's the best thing the film has,why?;because it's all;the performances, the dialogues,the locations (with incredible shadows and lights in everyone),the direction,etc.So, if you want to see one of the best films (if not the best )of 1999,see this masterpiece.",10,0,0,8 December 2000
Stalingrad," The reality of the war : the hell.
","'Stalingrad' was the first realistic war film i saw .This was 4 years ago.Since then , i only have seen another :'Das Boot'.Both films shows the real war ,not the surrealist things you see in American war movies.In 'Stalingrad' you see normal people having to fight in a (like all of them),horrible war.In a war not everybody is a monster ,that is what American films show about the Germans ;most of them were normal people.Of course there were monsters ,like the German official this film shows, but most of them were like you and me.This film don't try to show German soldiers like saints ,try to show them like humans. The German characters that appear in American war movies are always the same.That isn't the true ;they were people that didn't wished to be there ,fighting for a lunatic,more than 2000 miles from home.The filings you see in this film are absolute real :people crying , wishing to be in home with his woman , not in the middle of nowhere, having to fight against other normal people (the Russians)for survive, all of this in the middle of the snow and the ice,with a temperature of less 20 C degrees.This is the real war :the hell.",10,2,3,20 November 2000
