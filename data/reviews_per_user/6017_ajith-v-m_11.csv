It," Not that great
","Saw this movie today. I think it's a bit too overrated. Not horror to me at all, didn't find it that intriguing as well. Almost, fell asleep to some of the so called horror and some parts actually made me laugh.However, I must admit those kids acted damn well! All of them, have a great career in acting. If you're a fan of James Wan kind of horror movies, you wouldn't like this at all but if you haven't experienced James Wan kind of horror, you wouldn't mind this.",5,1,3,7 October 2017
Wind River," Must watch at any cost!
","I have no words to describe this movie and for Jeremy's performance. This by far must be his best performance in his entire career. Absolute goose-bumps in every emotion, expression and word that he showed and said. If this doesn't win a man an award as the best actor then God alone knows what would!!The movie depicts the loss families undergo with the loss of their loved one, in this case, their daughters as a result of a group of serial rapists. The movie is shot in mountains of snow with plenty of cinematic experience that gives you the chills by the story and the sheer cold of the mountains. Jeremy just blew my mind with his performance. Not once did he act, he actually lived every moment. Please ensure he gets an award for this performance. The movie is a straight out 10/10!!",10,0,3,1 October 2017
Deadpool 2," Totally Awesome!
","This movie was one hell of a fun ride of action and humor. I totally loved it right from the beginning to the end. There's nothing I can pinpoint as a mistake in this movie, was more fun than the first Deadpool. JUST WATCH IT!",10,2,8,7 August 2018
Beasts of No Nation," Stop Watching Movies if you disliked this!
","I watched this movie expecting much and I must say it delivered beyond my expectation. The plot, the anxiety of the situation at hand is so true to what happens in Africa. I re-lived every moment watching this movie. The boy was just impeccable. Least to say, this must be the best African based movie ever! The camera work, background music, angles, cinematography JUST EVERYTHING WAS TOP NOTCH! You really want know what goes down in Africa? Watch this movie. I'm not going to say any more and kill the experience revealing everything in the comments section but I strongly suggest you stop watching movies if you dislike this one!",10,4,9,17 October 2015
Evil Dead," You will grind your teeth, hide, cry but you still can't escape - BRILLIANT MOVIE!!
","There is absolutely nothing in the world that can actually scare me after the Exorcist but this movie...GOOD GOD! I was at the edge of my freaking seat praying to God that I never want to EVER experience what happened in this movie. The sound effects, the lighting, the camera angles, the atmosphere, the background music, the evil appearance is from HELL itself! For all horror fans, if you haven't watched this movie, do yourself a favor, STOP WATCHING HORROR MOVIES EVER!The acting was impeccable. Absolutely Kudos to the director, actors, sound editors and cameraman in particular. The angles shot were so freaking scary that I turned away from the screen at times cos I was too chicken to watch it! The story revealed with the compelling horror scenes will scare the Jesus out of you!!I'm going to say no more! If you really like horror, then you MUST and I mean MUST see this! This will remain my favorite horror movie ever after the Excorcist!! Fede Alvarez - Bloody Brilliant Direction!!",10,1,4,6 December 2015
Don't Breathe," Lost my breath so many times I almost went blue!!
","First off, standing ovation to Fede Alvarez!! This man never fails to deliver the best. I watched this movie last night and my God! There were moments when I lost my breath and went blue! Fede Alvarez really impressed me with his brilliant Evil Dead in 2013 and now this one blew me off my heels!! This is without a shadow of doubt the best Home Invasion Thriller and Horror movie. The sound effects, camera angles, background music etc..everything is top notch. 3 thief's successful in all their robbery attempts but gets greedy and decides to rob one last house, the house of a blind man! They though it would be the easiest heist but turn out to be a nightmare they'll never forget. This movie is just chills to every bone in your body!!Fede Alvarez, If you're reading this, please let me know how I can contribute for you to make more movies cos your direction, though process and delivery is simply beyond perfection. For the fans, DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE AT ANY COST! I've watched it in the theater and I'm also going to buy a Blue Ray copy when it's out so that everything i spend is contributed to movies like this.",10,0,3,15 October 2016
Zero Dark Thirty," Not Impressive, didn't expect it to be this terrible...
","Lets start with the beginning, the characters were kind of dull in their performances. Right from the CIA agent torturing Omar to the Lady at the CIA. The plot could be more interesting if they made a much more aggressive approach. Now i have no idea where they thought of Arabic in Pakistan but my experience says its more of Urdu. Considering the fact that the movie was all about capturing the most wanted man in the world, i think they should've made this more intensifying. Honestly, i fell asleep in the first half, the theater was just dumb silent and could hear folks yawn for crying out loud! The only thing that kept me awake was the timely suicide bombers that cracked once in a while. Apart from that, nothing interesting. The camera work was shoddy as ever, they try to make it look real with the shaky camera experience but that just made it worse. I think this movie could've done a lot better if the camera work was just like a normal feature film with more of middle east music in the background to keep the spirits alive. It was a bit too silent and speculative. Certainly not something worth watching in a theatre, you may as well get a DVD and watch it just once at home.",4,18,35,6 March 2013
Jojo Rabbit," Snore Fest
","Don't know who's paying for these reviews. I'm stuck at home due to Covid-19 but still prefer to do nothing than watch this snore fest. I've never seen something as stupid and ridiculous to the extent that it's not even funny if it was made for just comedy.To conclude, this movie is the only cure to Insomnia.",1,3,13,11 April 2020
Life," People are just impossible!!
","Before I watched this movie, I was skeptical looking at all the reviews here but I'm glad I went with my hunch and watched it. Don't believe any of the reviews here, it's all nonsense written by a bunch of folks who think their mind is beyond a scientist and tries to criticize the entire movie citing 'Logic'. Have any of you retards thought that this is a Science Fiction movie? More like do you know the meaning of the word 'Fiction'?? This movie gave me the creeps and I enjoyed every moment from the beginning to the end. The CGI was so brilliant that the Alien looked more real than the humans! The Director did a brilliant job with the entire atmosphere, camera work, music and what not. It literally got me sitting at the edge of my seat, especially the moment the Alien left the lab. Every moment from then on was just pure brilliant!If you liked the game Alien Isolation, you'll love this movie, and we all know how superb a game it was! People are just impossible; they look at every given opportunity to criticize such great efforts to make movies purely for our pleasure. Please keep your stupid logic to yourself and try to enjoy a movie for the way it is. Applaud the efforts put in by the entire crew instead of just sitting your flabby rears before a computer to write crap that you have no knowledge about.Watch this movie in theater at all costs! It's truly a fantastic science fiction thriller of being chased in space by one hell of an Alien! If you still want to read these ridiculous negative reviews on here, then get back to Discovery channel and spend your time rubbing on logic. Some folks are just as stupid as it gets!",10,9,20,3 June 2017
Annihilation," Weirdest Movie Ever
","Well, I saw this today and while I admit that I was engaged to it due to the scenic beauty and the creativity, the story and scenes behind it made absolutely no sense.All I can say is watch this if you just want to kill some time and feel weird as this movie is weird as it comes. I understood nothing.",5,1,3,16 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," Were they mocking us??
","Saw this movie over the weekend good gosh they totally messed up the franchise! I've never seen a more horrible Alien movie in the past. Thanks God i saw 'Life 2017' after that cos that was one hell of a brilliant movie but Alien Covenant is pure trash. Looks like the Director and Producers made a mockery of us to cash in by making some stupid movie, thinking we would watch it only for the creativity (which again appeared crap!)1/10 from me, go watch Life 2017 instead!",1,2,4,4 July 2017
