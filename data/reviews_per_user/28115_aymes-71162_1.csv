It," Not a horror film for horror fans
","Acting was mediocre. They could have done without the kids using profane & vulgar language. I didn't find it amusing. An attempt to incorporate humor was foolish. I didn't find it funny, but annoying. I went on my own to see this and expected it to be at least frightening but it was not frightening to me at all. I found it boring, kept on looking at my watch and wanting it to be over. The story lines made no sense. Pennywise was OK. I found the original Pennywise to be far more creepy and scary, both in appearance and voice. I have to say I prefer the original series, although I thought that ending was stupid. Overall, I was disappointed and wish I had waited until it came out on television to see it. This film started off good but dropped after that. It has so much potential. Oh well.",4,8,15,14 September 2017
