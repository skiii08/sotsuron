Antz," Glistening visuals combine with an excellent voice cast and a clever script to make a superb movie.
","Antz is a genuinely clever film, which should appeal to people of all ages but is geared more for adults. While equally impressive CG movies such as Shrek and Ice Age were hilarious and often laugh-out-loud funny, Antz settles for dry wit and clever anecdotes. But what this film is best for is its glamorous and well-developed voice cast. The main character, Z, is voiced by Woody Allen so to get full enjoyment out of this film really depends on whether you like Woody Allen or not. Most of the other voices are easily recognisable and are given plenty of conviction. Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Christopher Walken, Sharon Stone and Jennifer Lopez. Some of the other voice talents don't have many lines and aren't quite as recognisable. `Third Rock From the Sun's' Jane Curtin, Dan Akroyd, `Frasier's' John Mahoney.
 There are a few slow moments in the script but it does consistently entertain. Some of the jokes will only really appeal to adults and the film is a tad short, but these are only minor flaws. Far superior to Disney's A Bug's Life, which was released at about the same time, Antz is a hugely enjoyable movie, which is well worth a look. 8.1 out of 10.",10,0,0,22 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a very big disapointment
","star wars: episode 1 was very disapointing. mainly because it was so unengaging. the movie was very hard to follow and often confusing. the fact that it had a kid in it also contributed to its boringness. you could practically sleep through it and not miss any point of interest. jar jar binks didn't help the film much either. i found him to be an annoying jamaican sounding, goat looking, goon. sure, the computer effects were good but all the C.G.I. in the world couldn't save it. it was also far too predictable. we all knew that qui qon quack was going to die a horrible death. don't get me started on darth small. he may have delivered his one line perfectly but it really needed to follow up on that. and my final point, what does a trade federation have to do with star wars. this film was quite simply a mess from start to finish. absolute drivel",7,2,3,9 August 2002
Casablanca," The Sixth Greatest Film Of All Time ????????
","First off, I'm going to say this once and make it very clear. If you liked 'Casablanca' and though it was a work of 'sheer brilliance' than that's fine. Hence the old saying 'each to his own'. If you didn't like it, then I agree with you. Now before you snobs critically abuse, hear me out. I saw nothing in it that was deserving of the title 'epic'. Now I am not one of those ignorami who hate movies made before 1970. Many of these live up to their name (Zulu, Singin' In The Rain, Ben-Hur). I found Casablanca to be boring overlong and poorly acted. While the work of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergmen may have been good for it's time it is insufficient compared to todays advanced standards. The settings are dull and rather unimaginative.
Sure, you 'Cinematic Elite' may like it, but is 'Casablanca' really the kind of movie that would appeal to the average person at their local cinema. I wanted to like the film (I really did), but I'm not going to pretend I liked it just because all of you fellow critics admired it. But that's my opinion, if you agree with me then please send a message. If you disagree, then enlighten me.",2,37,83,13 April 2003
Minority Report," Spectacular, dazzling futuristic sci-fi thriller, demonstrating Hollywood at its very best.
","`Minority Report' is without doubt one of the greatest sci-fis in a long, long time. Popcorn entertainment for the eyes and mind. What it really is, is a demonstration of how outstanding technology is in the high-tech world of today. Of course one of the main problems that effects these blockbuster hits is that it may overload on special effects and be very poor in the script and dialogue. `Minority Report' avoids this problem with delightful relish. Of course the visuals are mesmerising as expected, but the plot holds your attention and the dialogue is never clunky, wooden or unconvincing. Another thing that the film has in spades is imagination. It tries to show a well-detailed portrait of a gloomy utopian future. You can see that a lot of work went into the script and the imagination is simply oozing out of its sides. But it has a minor deficiency of one thing- heart. While there is plenty of genuine grievances with Tom Cruise's character and his wife, the rest of the cast doesn't seem to have that many emotional reactions. However, there's still more heart present than in similarly themed big-budget outings. Besides, the body is big enough to carry the brains around. `Minority Report' is divided into three different parts, each a different branch of the sci-fi genre. It starts off as a futuristic noir with a cool plot, in which cops must race against time to prevent crimes. The second part is rather like `The Fugitive' with the classic man-on-the-run scenario. But there's the extra-added twist that keeps us on the edge of the seat- he kills someone in 48 hours who he's never heard of or does he? The least glamorous of the three parts, the conclusion is a gloomy but enjoyable `clue-in-the-clock' mystery/suspense thriller. Of course the story does seem complicated, but it makes sense if you give it your attention.
In a film that headlines Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, one would have the highest of expectations, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. They are two of Hollywood's biggest icons and it's about time they worked together.
`Minority Report' is simultaneously a dark vision of the future and Hollywood at its most glamorous (excelling brilliantly both ways). With some many great things, the minor quibbles are virtually erased to make this a chilling, outstanding and above all else enjoyable science fiction movie. My IMDb rating: 8.4/10.",10,2,4,16 May 2003
Erin Brockovich," Slickly directed and nicely performed, though it is a bit one-sided.
","WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERSErin Brockovich is a well done and quite enjoyable movie, even if it does blatantly shout at the screen `give me an Oscar'. It's directed by Steven Soderbergh, who won an Oscar that same year for Traffic. So if you like his cool, hip style of directing then you'll probably like this film.
Julia Roberts takes on the lead role and I'll give the devil its due, she gives a very convincing performance. But then again she was well overdue for one. Her performances in her usual run-of-the-mill rom-coms were giving me a strong sense of déjà vu. I still think that she's far from being the best actress of all time but this film has brought her one step closer. Albert Finney easily fits into the role of Erin's jolly despondent boss and seems to be enjoying it, for what it's worth. Newcomer Aaron Eckhart takes on a rather unrealistic role but does a good job of it. I'll admit I don't like films like The Parallax View and Arlington Road where the bad guys win but nonetheless, `Erin Brockovich' could have done with a bit of opposition from the company she was sueing.
The film isn't exactly complex and lacks emotional power but it's still a brilliant film that holds your attention and has a very satisfying ending.",Null,1,2,21 February 2003
Unbreakable," Eerie, moody and atmospheric follow-up to The Sixth Sense. A bit empty, but reasonably good.
","M. Night Shy- insert weird syllable here- s follow up to The Sixth Sense is a moody and enjoyable one. `Unbreakable' establishes the director's style of `subtly creepy with a twist' sense of filmmaking. While it's not as good as The Sixth Sense' it is still very good entertainment. The dark settings and unusual atmosphere and to the established uniqueness. The acting is fairly good aswell. Bruce Willis is very quiet for the most part, but does a solid job. Samuel L. Jackson, in his third film working with Willis (I think), is equally impressive as the personified form of fragile glass. Robin Wright Penn is OK as the distant wife, but perhaps a bit too vague and indefinite. It works with a small cast but keeps you compelled to their actions. The only fault I have is that it isn't rewatchable. The first time watching it, you don't know what will happen and are constantly on the edge of your seat. But the second time round, you know when the scares are coming and you'll probably find the intervals between the spooky scenes too be a bit too long and irrelevant. But the twist in the end and the unique sense of style are enough to keep you thoroughly entertained. While it doesn't aim for the high note of success as the Sixth Sense did and isn't as expansive and fulfilling as the other movie, it is still a good mixture of humane drama and surreal science fiction. I give it 6.7/10.",Null,2,3,28 March 2003
As Good as It Gets," Witty, amusing and touching little comedy of personal difference.
","Nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1997, 'As Good As It Gets' manages to live up to its hype. The comic timing is impeccable, perfectly balancing drama and light comedy. The script is well devised and the stars couldn't be any more suited to their roles. The two (or three) leads shine here. Jack Nicholson makes a career breakthrough as a neurotic, grumpy, obsessive compulsive and cynical old man. He proves that he can excel equally at drama and at comedy. Helen Hunt also makes a career breakthrough and goes past the smiley sitcom character in 'Mad About You'. She is very convincing as the single mother cum waitress and rightfully beat Kate Winslet for the Oscar. While the limelight is aimed more at Nicholson and Hunt, Greg Kinnear does very well as a gay artist. Cuba Gooding Jnr. isn't really giving it his all but does OK anyway and makes good support. The brilliant script, the comic timing, the undeniable charm, the great performances and the overall enjoyablity add up to make 'As Good As It Gets' a charming, cute and instantly likeable light comedy. It's a shame that the Academy Awards don't pay much attention to other comedies like this. I give it 7.7/10.",10,1,1,17 March 2003
Memento," An underrated gem. Truly, one of the most complex movies ever made.
","I can't believe that Memento isn't as commercially popular as it should be. This is a movie that compares well against all the classics. It's so cleverly devised and amazingly scripted that it will hold your attention from the very start and keep you fully engaged in concentration throughout.
It's probably the first film that is told back to front, the film ending with how it should start. This is a concept that, prior to this, had never been attempted before. And there are plenty of twists that will leave you gob-smacked. The story is set in a realisticly tacky, daytime suburban L.A. The cast isn't very commercially popular and it's made on a ver small budget (it was shot over thirteen days) but that's why its so great.
The only way Memento is ever going to get popular is by strong word of mouth. It's rated as the 10th best movie of all time by you fellow IMDb users (and rightfully so). Indeed, Memento is an unseen classic. 8.7 out of 10.",10,1,3,21 February 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Swashbuckling action flick is a good summer blockbuster.
","I have to admit I was hoping this film would be bad. Never really been a fan of pirate movies, and judging by the trailers, I thought this would be phoney and shallow. `Pirates of the Caribbean' has been receiving mass critical praise since the opening week and I can see why. It has that certain charm about it which is very hard to resist. The plot follows a very familiar outline, but the film comes to life in the swooping visuals and brilliant fight scenes. Essentially, `Pirates' is a B movie but a rather good one at that. While it is immensely enjoyable, is this really a five star movie? It's a big-budget large-scale blockbuster in the vein of `The Hulk' and `Terminator 3' but it hardly pushes the limits of cinema.
The movie is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer- the helm behind similarly themed efforts such as `The Rock' and `Pearl Harbour'- so I can't say I'm surprised that there are so many big bangs throughout. Technical credits are top-notch all across the board. The cinematography, in particular, is a huge stand out. The CG work is good as well, but over showy in parts. Case in point is the scene in which Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa) turns into a skeleton and then drinks alcohol that we see as if we were wearing x-ray specs. While the animated work for that scene is good, the `It's-the-21st-century. -Look-what-we-can-do' effect comes across in an overtly preachy way. But this part is brief so there's no need to go into too much detail with it.
And as your classic adventure movie, there are the three main characters- the hero, the significant other and the hammy villain. Also in there is a jilted lover/ hero #2, but he's perfectly relevant to the plot. Of course, the media are constantly saying `the film has everything! Action, comedy, drama, romance'- virtually 90% of all movies have all those factors. As I said, it all comes down to the action. The cheesy jokes, romantic subplots etc. are okay, but hardly what `Pirates' will be remembered for.Johnny Depp has the charisma and quirkiness to carry the role of Jack Sparrow. Better yet, he makes the role his own. With the offbeat swagger and cheesy one-liners, no one could have executed the role better. And the hammy villain is perfectly portrayed by Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush, who does this comic-style part just as well as the tougher ones. Keira Knightley (I hate that name) would seem like the perfect stereotype, but her character is well written and she brings life to- what could have been- a very flat performance. But Orlando Bloom seems out of place. His character has no charisma, no characteristics, no quirky one liners. And the lines are delivered without credibility. There's such thing as `playing it straight', but this is more wooden than the plank which he walks off of.
And while the closing moments may go on for a bit too long, there's enough treasured moments to be able to forgive all that. And while there is no emotional core that elevates above the level of `a flashy action packed adventure-fest', you probably shouldn't expect one. So if you want an old-fashioned crowd pleaser, you won't go far wrong with `Pirates of the Caribbean'- a film which I'm almost ashamed to say that I enjoyed. My IMDb rating: 6.9/10.",Null,1,2,23 August 2003
Batman Returns," Dark and gloomy but brilliantly performed low-camp sequel.
","A sequel to the 1989 hit, Batman Returns doesn't match up to it's predecessor's  standard but is expertly conceived and nicely acted, nonetheless. It's from the darkly imaginative mind of Tim Burton, so don't expect any of the camp or colourful costumes of the original Adam West series to appear here. The film's huge pitfall is that it's not very enjoyable. The backdrop is a dim-lit depressive one, the film doesn't have much of a heart and the overall effect is a rather dull one. The twisted Christmas town-land of Gotham City is hardly uplifting. But still, the film has a lot of good things going for it aswell. `Batman Returns' really captivates in its picture perfect casting. Michael Keaton, reprising his role, is convincing as subtly soft-spoken Bruce Wayne and the dark knight, Batman himself. There's no one else you could envision in the role of the Penguin, other then Danny De Vito and he really captures the role and does a great job of it. Christopher Walken does his usual `mono-psycho schtick' to great reception. But the most impressive is Michelle Pfeiffer as the seductively sassy Catwoman, Selina Kyle. Perhaps her costume is a bit too suggestive, but she's the first love interest to have something important to do with the plot. Her character jumps off the screen with great conviction. Overall, `Batman Returns' isn't quite as good as its predecessor. It lacks the first films action, wit and enjoyability. But `Batman Returns' is very imaginative and the new characters are brilliantly conceived. And it's much better than it's high-camp childish sequels, Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. A good superhero movie. 6.6/10.",Null,0,0,28 February 2003
The Mummy," Computer effects drenched excuse for a decent movie.
","First off, I have haven't seen the original version of `The Mummy' so I can't comment on how the new version compares to the original. But if it were anyway above average, then it would beat this one hands down. Because what we are presented with is a poorly acted, special effects laden, and rather cartoony, hopelessly unconvincing movie. Now I'm not one of those critical snobs who believes that all movies should try to be cinematic masterpieces, but this is just plain childish for the most part.
But there is that one saving grace that only barely manages to lift it out of the dross- the computer effects. That was probably the sole intention of reviving this old film. But in fairness to it, the luscious landscapes and beautifully created computer generated images do compensate for some things, but not enough. The one bad thing that stands out amid the rest is the acting. Brendan Fraser was a blindingly bad choice as the film's hero. Mainly because he just isn't serious enough for the part. Rachel Weisz is OK for her part as a clutz, but does tend to overact in the worst possible way. John Hannah was yet another bad choice as yet another form of comic relief. He attempts to be funny but only succeeds in being excruciatingly annoying. Arnold Vosloo takes on the bad-guy role of the title. He's OK but it would have better had he been replaced by a CG mummy. Another very bad thing is the way that the film goes for cheap and rather childish jokes instead of solid shocks and genuine scares. It lowers the overall effect to make it seem far too much like a comedy than anything else. The visual effects only barely make `The Mummy' anything to recommend. The narrative, acting and overall tone are appallingly bad. But at least it's better than its disastrous sequel `The Mummy Returns'. At the same time though, this is below par. 4.8/10.",7,0,1,25 April 2003
Chicken Run," Very entertaining, beautifully crafted visuals, and a good script.
","Chicken Run is a parody of The Great Escape, only set in a hencoop. It is highly imaginative and uses good animation techniques. The putty-style animation is very well done, but not quite as popular as computer animation. But still, the three-dimensional landscapes and characters are very impressive and a good change from flat 2D.The majority of the vocal cast isn't as well known as those in other similarly themed 3D movies such as Antz and Shrek, but the characters are very likeable, and Mel Gibson does a good job at being an arrogant rooster.While never exactly hilarious, Chicken Run is consistently witty and very entertaining. It compares well against other animated movies and is effortlessly rewatchable. An excellent movie, 8 out of 10.",10,1,2,31 January 2003
L.A. Confidential," Off the record, on the QT, and veryÂ…. Hush hush.
","That sums up the epitome of L.A. Confidential. It presents to us the sordid realism of the early 50's, in the way we haven't seen it. Most of us are used to the sugary `Gene Kelly/ Rock Hudson' sunshine utopia that was, in the MGM `Golden Age'. L.A. Confidential shows us the gritty, seedy underworld of this period. And a brilliant job it does aswell. This deft, elegant portrait succeeds on every level. The stars are well suited to their roles and present their own unique styles. Guy Pearce is brilliant as the smart, thinking detective while Russell Crowe delivers equal oomph as the polar opposite to this; the tough no nonsense brood. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her performance and rightfully so. She not only resembles but also mimics the `50's slut' to great effect. The only person who didn't stand out was Kevin Spacey. He didn't do much with his role, was highly unmemorable and gave a very vague performance. He's more of a decoration than the main star. Danny Devito is short and annoying in the usual `seedy journalist' style, but still very convincing. The opening documented narrative sequence establishes the film's unique style and slick dissection of life. The film's direction is never less than superb. The editing, settings and cinematography are top notch. Add on to this a great script and you have a classic. Perhaps it is a bit overrated, but it is also undeniably compelling. Overall, `L.A. Confidential' is a brilliant film. 8.3/10.",10,1,2,15 March 2003
X-Men," Comic strip superhero caper which manages to be very enjoyable and highly imaginative.
","X-Men is a very entertaining adaptation of the comic book/ cartoon series with appeal for X-Men fans and non-fans alike. The film isn't as bright or exuberant as I thought it would be but it does keep you thoroughly entertained for it's 95 minute running time. The cast works well together for the most part. Patrick Stewart is the most obvious pic for Professor Xavier and does a good job bringing some class to the film. Sir Ian McKellen is brilliant as the X-Men's archenemy Magneto. Newcomer Hugh Jackman closely resembles the hero of the bunch, Wolverine, and manages to be a `superhero' without wearing yellow spandex.
Strangely, I imagined someone older like Meryl Streep or Jessica Lange in the role of Storm, as she did look middle-aged in the comic. Thankfully, Halle Berry is a very welcome addition, taking on the role of the character. Anna Paquin is the teenage heroine Rogue. She doesn't look like much of a heroine and is more suited to the melodrama genre but she does well in her role. I'm not going into any more detail on the rest of the X-Men, but they were all pretty good in their contributions. The film tries a bit too hard to avoid camp. While it was very enjoyable, it could have been a bit better if it was more colourful. Much of the film was taking up with introducing the characters, so the end battle scene was only a taste of what will come in the sequel, X-2, which is due out later this year. `X-Men' aims for a lower note of popularity than Spider-Man and Superman did, but it's still every bit as enjoyable. At an hour and a half the film is a bit short, but what the film is good at well overshadows its minor faults. Overall, X-Men is a great and distractive little movie. Definitely the best blockbuster of Summer 2001. Very enjoyable, highly entertaining, effortlessly re-watchable, what else can I say. 7.4/10.",Null,0,0,28 February 2003
The Terminator," Visceral, violent sci-fi thriller which defines the 1980's.
","For me, the thing that stood most from this film was the foggy atmosphere and far out-dated, cheesy music. Yes, I did like this, very much so but it does have its flaws.The films visual effects were outstanding for their time but the quality is poor, compared to todays standards. Thank God there's not much of it. But despite this poor CGI the films atmosphere and visuals are excellent. The movies typically foggy, 80's visuals go surprisingly well and add to the films overall effect. The neon lights and glamour also contribute.Unfortunately not much can be said for the acting. Arnold Scharzanegger does have good acting abilities (as proved in End of Days). But with only 16 lines he does come a little 'short'. Michael Biehn isn't much better and doesn't come across well trying to be an action hero,(what sort of name is Kyle Reese). Linda Hamilton is good, nuff' said.The Terminator will always be remembered as a classic. In my opinion its better than then the sequel. Lets face it, without Terminator there would be no Terminator 2. It may be somewhat ironic (why would people from 2029 have mullets?), but it does have its moments. Overall, excellent 8.2 out of 10.",10,1,2,5 October 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Dark and imaginative tale caught in genre trouble.
","Another addition to Tim Burton's series of dim-lit but very entertaining movies, `Sleepy Hollow' isn't a disappointment. The subject is a headless horseman in turn-of-the-century era New York outskirts. Burton's style is perceptible in the gloomy yet deeply moody atmosphere. But the film isn't perfect. The main problem is the lack of audience that this would appeal to. While it is a bloody horror, this seems as though it would appeal to the young male audience. But with the `Dangerous Liaison'-esque atmosphere and periodic settings, this seems like one for the cinematic elite.
The film isn't a misfire and there are plenty of good things that stand. The costume designs and set pieces are very impressive and the visual effects are magnificent. But there are other things that decrease the positives. The dialogue is wooden and occasionally unconvincing. It works best as a horror and attempts at humour are laughably bad. But with a cast like this, you feel compelled to their every move, with Johnny Depp as the `Knight in shining armour'. Let's face it, he isn't suited to brawny action. In fact he must be the most effeminate superhero in the world. Unfortunately, he doesn't keep in with the audience and just doesn't cut it as the lead star. Luckily he is supported by a huge supporting cast, including Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, Casper Van Dien, Martin Landau, Lisa Marie, Ian McDiarmuid, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough and Christopher Walken as the horseman himself. This endless amount of star-power well supports Johnny Depp in the lead and make the film all the more watchable.
With so many positives, the negatives are almost completely erased. Yes the dialogue may be shamefully clunky, but Tim Burton could do much worse than this. So overall, `Sleepy Hollow' is a minor success. 6.3/10.",8,1,1,18 April 2003
Scary Movie 2," Feeble, vulgar and tasteless humour, watch at the expense of your dignity.
","Sequels don't come much worse than this atrocity. Scary Movie 2 is a spoof of the haunted house genre, which parodies other movies such as Titanic and Charlie's Angels to minimal effect. While its predecessor was creative and often laugh-out-loud funny, this sequel just goes way too far.The feeble jokes are for the most part, just plain disgusting. The new characters in the film are undeveloped, unwelcome and have no charisma. In particular, blow dryer Tori Spelling. Another thing, most of the characters who they killer off in the first one return here with no apparent explanation. They even decided to bring in James Woods and `Alien's Veronica Cartwright for a dreadful and rather pointless sketch on `The Exorcist' at the start of the movie. With more scriptwriters than jokes, I absolutely detested this film's risible attempt at humour.But then again, if a money shot of sperm, a man being smoked by weed, a deranged hand, an invisible genitalia, a big black penis in some poor clown's mouth, a girl p*ssing herself and a vomit marathon are your idea of humour, then watch this film. Otherwise, avoid, avoid, avoid. 2.6 out of 10.",Null,3,6,3 May 2003
Alien," Overrated, inappropriately directed and tediously boring
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSAm I the ONLY person who didn't like Alien. What was so flawless about it? Here's the plot in a nutshell. Crew of spaceship find alien egg. Bursts out of someones stomache and kills them all one by one until one of them eventually kills it. All that over 117 minutes.There is absolutely no music. A crew member spends ten minutes looking for a cat, (not expecting an alien to kill him) and guess what happens. I think it would have been ten times better if it was a little less subtle, quicker to get the point and directed by somebody else. But i'm SUPPOSED to love this film because every critic on the planet does. This is overrated and unworthy of its hype.",2,35,87,19 January 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Wouldn't hold a candle to any of the original Star Wars Trilogy
","Attack Of The Clones is a film which relies to much on special effects and not enough on dialogue and overall enjoyabilty. The characters are in no way as likeable as Chewbacca, Han Solo and the original charaters. While the original Star Wars Trilogy used modelling and puppet techniques, Attack Of The Clones relies to much on computer effects. Far too much blue screen work. Don't get me wrong, the blue screen is good in small doses. IN SMALL DOSES. But 90% of what we see on the screen are computer effects.
The film's battle scenes are well choreographed and prepared, but endlessly boring. The dialogue is wooden and duller than you could possibly imagine. 'Yes master, no master'. And as for the love story, never has a relationship seemed so unconvincing. The story is thrown together with little thought being put into it. All the CGI in the world cannot save it from it's lamentable script. It's minorly better than Episode 1, but still not much to write home about. This one's for Star Wars fans and people with good attention spans only.",2,3,7,26 January 2003
Forrest Gump," Enjoyable and expansive story that gets overly indulgent in parts but entertains thoroughly.
","Winning umpteen different Oscars in 1994 and constantly parodied, Forrest Gump manages to live up to its `classic' status. Although it does become a bit too manipulative and sometimes surreal in parts, it's also very witty and joyfully nostalgic. Tom Hanks does the role of crippled hero Forrest Gump (the most parodied character on the planet). He's ideal for the role but despite whoever takes on the role, the character himself is very unconvincing. Gary Sinise is a lot more convincing as a cynical Vietnam soldier. Sally Field (melodramatic as usual) doesn't show us anything new but is good for the part nonetheless. Robin Wright doesn't do much in the film, even though the plot kind of revolves around her. A but more conviction would have been helpful.
What the film is best for is its wonderful depiction of the rockin' 50's, the swingin 60's and the sleazy 70's. This is accompanied by a soundtrack, which is well suited to the times. However, the film falls way short on its portrayal of the (glitzy?) 80's. The costumes, set designs and attitudes seem very inappropriate and very little thought went into this part of the movie. The other problem is the script. For the most part it is good but it gets too inventive in some scenes and goes way too far. Some surrealism is OK but having one man be involved in every major event in three decades is crossing the line. Overall, `Forrest Gump' probably didn't deserve to win the Oscar for Best Picture, but if you put all of the evident flaws aside, you have a great movie. I give it 7.5/10.",7,1,4,15 March 2003
"Monsters, Inc."," Enjoyable well created compu-toon. Some flaws, but still highly entertaining
","The latest compu-toon from the Big Mouse is a highly entertaining one, which is a step further in computer animation. Released about the same time as Dreamwork's `Shrek' and 20th Century Fox's `Ice Age', this proves that Disney is still as strong as it was 60+ years ago.The story is set in Monstropolis as big-time scarer Sulley and his one eyed friend Mike work for Mr. WaterNoose at Monsters Incorporated. They use children's screams to produce electricity for the city. But when a human child accidentally gets into Monstropolis, Mike and Sulley must try to get it back into the real world, all while avoiding rival monster Randell.As you can see, it's very imaginative and has a fresh concept. For the most part, the vocal talent is very good. John Goodman is easily recognisable and suitable as the big monster, Sulley. Billy Crystal is really good as well and his cynical, sarcastic sense of humour helps liven up the film and give it a sharper edge. Jennifer Tilly is also good as love interest Celia and has great chemistry with the rest of the characters. The only one who didn't work for me was Steve Buscemi as the film's villain. He seemed inappropriate for the part and didn't have enough characteristics to be evil enough, mind you he does get a good come-upance.One of the film's main flaws was its style of humour. Much of it is based on the monsters over-reacting to very mild situations. This is OK in small doses, but it's been cropping up in many Disney films as of late. But the character humour helps make up for this. Some scenes in the film are a bit sugary and bring down the film's momentum. Most of those scenes between Sulley and Boo will be a letdown for adults. But the stunning visuals and good script should make up for these flaws. It lacks the dry wit and consistent entertainment of non Disney films such as the PG rated `Antz' and `Shrek', and the overall shape of the similarly themed `Ice Age', but it's imaginative, creative and a very welcome addition from Disney. By about an eyelash, it's the least of the three compu-toons released almost simultaneously but it's an excellent movie for children and adults alike. 7.6 out of 10.",6,3,8,7 February 2003
Notting Hill," Sharp clever brit-flick with a verbal wit like no other.
","A welcome change from your average `chick flick of the week', `Notting Hill' leaves a satisfying taste in the mouth. But there are a few nagging flaws. While the film opens brilliantly and maintains that pace up until about half way through the duration, after that the comedy becomes more sporadic, unsuccessfully mixing dry wit with needless sentimentality.
But the presence of Hugh Grant really lifts this one off the ground. His bumbling act never fails to amuse and is always right on the mark. On the other hand, Julia Roberts does little to outdo her reputation for being shallow and the love at first sight aspect of her character isn't all that believable. Rhys Ifans more erratic style of humour is equally welcome and the one-liners he uses are classic. The film loses a lot of momentum near the end but what has gone before erases a good amount of the minor drivel that followed. So, with a nice cast, a great script and a pleasant overall effect, `Notting Hill' is a success. 6.8/10.",6,1,1,3 May 2003
The Bourne Identity," Better than most Bond movies.
","A lot of Bond movies can learn from a film like this. It's a hell of a lot more realistic, and it contains some excellent martial arts scenes.In a lot of ways it is the opposite of a Bond movie. Take the 'chase around Paris' sequence. Does our hero elude the bad guys in a flash, swanky, cool Aston Martin. No. Instead he eludes them in a bashed up mini.
Who would have known that Matt Damon would have made a great action hero? I hope they go through with the sequel. If it does i'll be first in line. 7.5 out of 10.",6,0,1,5 October 2002
Cast Away," Too manipulative for it's own good.
","`Cast Away' is a less than average film overall and it certainly is nowhere near as good as it set out to be. There are only two stars in the film that are noticed, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Tom Hanks does fairly well and you can see that he has prepared for the role, but you can also see that he's not very happy with the material he's been given. Helen Hunt doesn't get enough screen-time, given the plot of the film. She is convincing as usual as a loving housewife but only has one scene in the movie in which she `jumps off' the screen.
`Cast Away' blatantly shouts out `Give me an Oscar'. The material sets out to be gripping and humane but I found it to be hollow on the inside and some of the scenes were unintentionally hilarious. Come on, one man's friendship with his football?????? At 145 minutes `Castaway' is overlong and surprisingly little is covered in that space of time. The film ends on a question mark and suddenly stops without any satisfying conclusion. Most people, including myself would probably feel cheated out of our money instead of engaged and satisfied. Only the most sentimentally minded audiences wouldn't fall for such blatant manipulation.",Null,1,2,15 March 2003
American Psycho," Clever, witty sub-slasher which explores the perils of obsession, fantasy and reality.
","American Psycho is an excellent adaption of an excellent book. It really couldn't be better. It doesn't try to be a comedy but some of the scenes manage to be very funny. (The Paul Allen murder scene is a riot.)Christian Bale's portrayal of a self-obsessed, jealous, competitive man, Patrick Bateman, is excellent and Oscar worthy. Willem Dafoe could have been used more but does well for his small part and it's a change to see him playing a good guy. It's good to see Jared Leto break away from teen-movies onto more serious roles and is terrific as the intelligent, but stupid Paul Allen. Chloe Sevigny gives a very humane performance as Bateman's secretary, Jean. Reese Witherspoon is disappointing as the bitchy character (which she always plays) Evelyn. That concludes the acting.The most unexpected thing about the film is the way it toned down on the books violence and capitalised on the books humour. Many of the lines that the characters deliver are effortlessly amusing. Bateman seems to always say, `I have to return some video-tapes' to get out of a sticky situation. `We saw a musical. O Africa Brave Africa It was a riot'. `I'm trying to listen to the new Robert Palmer tape, but my fiancée Evelyn keeps buzzing in my ear'. The way it pokes fun at wealthy snobs (Stash, even though he was a mute, was hilarious). I liked the way Bateman waffled on about Huey Lewis and The News before decapitating someone. Or Whitney Houston while 2 lesbians make out like there's no tomorrow. Watch out for the scene with the business cards.The film has a very confusing ending, which isn't exactly justified. Overall this is the most intelligent serial killer movie I've seen in a long time. 8.1 out of 10.",10,1,2,30 August 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Vapid, inept B-movie follows up to two A grade classics.
","`The Terminator' (1984) and `T2: Judgement Day' (1991) and rightfully considered as classics. Absolute landmarks in cinematic history. And while there have been campaigns against making another Terminator movie, for the sake of preserving the franchise, they went ahead and made a third instalment anyway. Not only that, it turned out to be the most expensive movie of all time. And for a film that cost some 200 million dollars, this doesn't live up to the hype. Essentially, `T3' is a B movie  unadulterated popcorn entertainment. Had it not been a sequel to the franchise, I might have a higher opinion of it. But it is an offence against sense to follow up to histrionic classics with `a B movie'. I think that director Jonathan Mostow was just cowering in the background working with the excuse that it was a B movie, hoping that no one would make comparisons. Well guess what Mostow? They did. No James Cameron, no Linda Hamilton, no Edward Furlong, Michael Biehn, Robert Patrick. The only shred of hope keeping this alive is Arnold Schwarzanegger. And in fairness to Arnie, he does a good job of his character. But it seems as though he is written for laughs given a bunch of jokes to utter- some good, others desperate-and loses the menace and brilliance of his character in the predecessors. Meanwhile, Nick Stahl gives the worst performance in the entire movie and is a very poor trade in for Edward Furlong. His lines aren't delivered with any believability, emotional scenes are incredibly flat and he simply ISN'T John Connor. Claire Danes on the other hand is a good trade in for Linda Hamilton (I can understand why she didn't want to be involved) and her relevance to the plot is believable. Kristanna Loken is absolutely terrible as the menace of the picture. Completely un-intimidating, instead of `Oh no! Look out' this is more a case of `Show us your boobs!' Also in there, Earl Boen jumps in just to say, `I'm here to explain why I'm still a cynic'.
The script is shallow and dull, conceived in the most immature style. Sarah Connor is written off in the most ridiculous fashion. `I know, let's give her a disease. Cancer? No, leukaemia!' Luckily, the film clocks in at about 102 minutes, so it's fast-paced enough not to bore. Special effects sequences are okay, but a huge waste of money when the finished product is this mediocre. An insufficient effort that, quite frankly, should never have been made, this is a very poor follow-up. Below average in acting, directing etc. this falls wide of the mark. On its own level, the movie is okay. But comparisons are inevitable and the expensive but brainless `T3' pales. Bottom line: die hard action fans, and those who see `The Terminator' franchise as infallible, only. My IMDb rating: 4.6/10.",Null,0,0,8 August 2003
American Beauty," Didn't deserve all the credit it received.
","I don't know what the big fuss is about American Beauty. Its one of those movies that virtually shouts at the screen, 'i'm an epic gimme an oscar'. Very much like Driving Miss Daisy. 'I'm an old lady gimme an oscar'. Or maybe even Boys Don't Cry. 'I showed my breasts on screen gimme gimme gimme'. Whats more, American Beauty also tries to suck so much sap out of you, you'll be blowing your nose with a pancake. The 'plastic bag blowing in the wind' scene was another pathetic attempt at winning an oscar. There were so many better movies that year that should have won an oscar, or even the best picture,(American Psycho, Dogma,Fight Club). Not much can be said about the acting. Kevin Spacey's skeptical portrayal was overrated it didn't deserve the oscar. The rest of the acting was bland, basic and with bad range. Annette Bening was probably the only good actress, although Geena Davis or Madaleine Stowe would also have done well for the part. The films only saving grace is its directing and soundtrack which are very good but the movie didn't deserve all the credit it received. 6.6 out of 10.",1,2,6,8 September 2002
Being John Malkovich," An original idea and an unusual experience. Good, but only for certain tastes.
","I really didn't know what to expect from this film. It had such an insane concept, I simply had to see it. I can't say that I came out disappointed, but the film was to say the least, surprising. I guess the film's main pitfall is that it's not very enjoyable. The films gradual descent into insanity is probably too surreal for all tastes. The acting is good for the most part. John Cusack gives an un-formulaic but ultimately convincing performance. Cameron Diaz was the most impressive out of the actors and gives her best performance yet. I don't think that Catherine Keener deserved the Oscar nomination she received. She was above standard in her role but certainly not amazing. I'm surprised that John Malkovich would even agree to star in this film but he does a good job of playing himself, Cameron Diaz and John Cusack (don't ask).
Towards the end film gets much too inventive for its own good. But one must admire the film's strange and unique style, slick direction and braveness to attempt such a strange concept. Its not as good as those other films films with daring concepts (The Truman Show etc.) but it's a nice try for what its worth and that's good enough. It's not as good as it should have been buts its a break from formulaic and unoriginal ideas. 6.5 out of 10.",9,1,2,21 February 2003
Spider-Man," Although flawed, Spiderman engages and on the whole highly entertaining.
","Its been a couple of months since I've seen Spider-man so its not fresh in my memory. However I can remember 90% of it so here goes. Despite the films minor flaws, on the whole it proves to be an enjoyable 2 hours. Heres a summary of my opinion of the film but don't worry. This is 'SPOILER FREE'.The costume for Spiderman was excellent and very well designed. It looked so clear I thought it was CGI. The Green Goblins costume was terrible and looked to clunky and metallic.Tobey Maguire does well as Spiderman although I still think Ben Affleck would have done a good job. Kirsten Dunst gives an imperceptible performance as Mary Jane. She goes un-noticed and her only asset is her hair that had been covered in lip-stick. Willem Dafoe, overall is OK as the Green Goblin, but anyone else could have done the part just as well.
The films cinematography is excellent. The movie aims at more popularity than X-Men, Generation X etc., which proves successful.But enough of that, this is a spectacular movie the may not be as good as the 1989 Batman(in my opinion) but is still an excellent movie.",6,0,0,6 September 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Glitzy, star-studded heist caper with a dazzling cast.
","A cool, slickly directed film, Oceans 11 is one of last years most exhuberant movies. It demands close attention if you want to get the most out of it. You could watch it ten times and still have missed out on a lot of important stuff. It has it's own unique style and far exceeds the original Rat Pack version. It has a cast of glamourous, big name actors, who do well in their parts. Matt Damon could have done with a bit more conviction here, though and his character(Linus Caldwall) doesn't properly develop. Julia Roberts is another let down here and gives a wooden and very unconvincing performance. She smiles but doesn't really act here. You'd think that she just showed up for one day of filming and for the rest of her scenes they used a wax model of her. (No-one noticed the difference) But this is still an entertaining two hours. It's not exactly a five star movie and at times can be a bit too complicated, but overall, this is a very cool and slickly made movie. 7.3 out of 10.",7,0,1,26 January 2003
Flashdance," Tacky, outdated 80's dance flick falls flat in the test of time.
","The dance flick- after the professional death of the musical, the `dance' genre took over in the late 70's with `Saturday Night Fever'. Of course the main problem with this new type of movie was the fact that the music would soon become outdated as times and attitudes went by. And `Flashdance' is the epitome of this doomed genre. Cheesy music, tacky clothes, big hair, fuzzy images- 80's enthusiasts only. In fact the only times in which this is actually good is when Irene Cara's Oscar winning song swoops onto the soundtrack. So, a good 90% of `Flashdance' is absolute drivel. The limp narrative bumbles along and is weaker than one would have imagined. Perhaps it would have been a better picture had it focused on the protagonist and she alone. But too much attention is put on supporting characters and their boring stories.
Weak, unimaginative, thoroughly formulaic directing styles don't help matters either. To put it as bluntly as possible, there is little if anything good about this perceptibly low-budget film. The main character (Alex) isn't interesting or unusual enough to be worthy of anything more than a passive attention. Alex is nicely, though not brilliantly, portrayed by Jennifer Beals. The (then) 18-year-old actress shows talent but has completely wasted her potential on made-for TV movies ever since. Meanwhile, the unrecognisable supporting players, a who's who of `Where are they now?' are the cinematic equivalent of walking, talking clichés. I could go into depth about how mediocre they are, but I just couldn't be bothered.
If you have photosensitive epilepsy, I advise you to stay away from `Flashdance'. You will either have a seizure or you won't make it out alive. One scene carries on with gratuitous strobe lighting for what seems like 10 minutes. Even if you're not an epileptic, you should stay away. Of course it eventually dances its way to a feel-good end that was semi-parodied in that Geri Halliwell music video. It leaves a good-taste, but doesn't compensate for the unforgivable dross that proceeds. A flat, shallow effort from everyone involved, the only saving grace is an above average turn from Jennifer Beals and Irene Cara's `What a Feeling'. I could go on for another while, but I'll summarise with this statement. `Flashdance' is a near dancing disaster. My IMDb rating: 3.8/10.",Null,3,6,15 August 2003
Man on the Moon," Un-compelling, uninteresting and not very easy on the eye.
","The night I was watching this, `The Thomas Crown Affair' with Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan was on the opposite channel. And now I regret missing the other film. Every 15 minutes I was tempted to change the channel, but I decided to stick with `Man on the Moon' to the end. The film is disappointing to say the least. While it is an informal and marginally interesting character study, it's not a very likeable or enjoyable one. Partly, because we are presented with a rather unlovely character. Andy Kaufman isn't given much justice here. He's not the kind of person we want to route for, or really care about. Because of the film's accurate but rather gritty portrayal of him, he doesn't get our sympathy, nor do we give a damn about what happens to him.  The majority of the film is made up of a series of dismally unfunny stand-up acts. We don't know if it's trying to be intentionally unfunny or unintentionally funny, but either way it doesn't work. `Man on the Moon' is deficient of the most basic `easy on the eye' qualities which really bring it down. It opens well with a black and white `credits' sequence but doesn't keep the audience compelled. Jim Carrey gives a generally good portrayal of Kaufman, but some of the scenes are too far out of his depth. He still hasn't made a satisfying transition to steady drama. Tinseltown throwaway Courtney Love is surprisingly good as Kaufman's down-to-earth girlfriend but is introduced too late into the movie to make much of an impact. The rest of the performances from the likes of Danny De Vito, Paul Giamatti and Vincent Schiavelli are good enough. It lacks dramatic shape and very basic qualities that are expected of most films. So `Man on the Moon' was an awkward project from day one. I suggest you give this one a miss. 4.2/10.",6,0,0,25 April 2003
Zulu," The only classic to begin with a 'Z'
","Unfortunately, thats all that Zulu is famous for. Thats actually quite a shame because I thought it was a classic to live up to its name. I'm not one to blindly obey what critics say, but I found Zulu to be an intense, periodic war epic. Acting standards have greatly increased over the years, but the performances from Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins and a young Michael Caine truly were outstanding. Perhaps the plot was a little thin but it managed to remain engrossing for the two and a half hour running time. If you haven't watched it from the very start then you probably won't get full enjoyment from it, you don't feel the time going by whilst watching it. Zulu is a definitive classic which hasn't dated over the years. 8/10",10,3,5,1 March 2003
The Game," Paranoiac, thought-provoking and highly entertaining thriller.
","Always keeping you on the edge of your seat, `The Game' is a brilliantly crafted psychological thriller with a cool scenario. And the promising plot leads to a conclusion that doesn't disappoint. The storyline alone is enough to recommend `The Game' but this is well backed up on most other levels. The script is well timed with plenty of imaginative sequences along with more twists and turns than a helter-skelter. There are also some appropriately dark directing techniques that are frequently used along with cool camera angles. The acting is very good, even if it is mainly a one-man-show. Michael Douglas was well cast in the lead role and the paranoia and odd occurrences in his normally quiet lifestyles make his transition very convincing. Sean Penn doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but does well in the few scenes that he's in. Deborah Kara Unger is standard is Christine, the woman you can and can't trust. There's some other average support from the likes of James Rebhorn, Armin Mueller Stahl and an actress that appeared to have vanished off the face of the Earth- Carroll Baker. The film grips like glue and doesn't let go until the `smack-in-the-face' conclusion. It doesn't make a whole lot of logical sense, but then again this is Hollywood we're talking about. Another good thing is the way it is so involving. We feel as though we are plunged into this world of surprises and betrayal that the protagonist is experiencing. It's an engaging puzzle that has to be worked out, so `The Game' is quite possibly the best psychological `rubix cube' thriller in years. It may heavily border on surrealism at times, but still remains very enjoyable and highly tense. I give it 7.9/10.",Null,0,1,3 May 2003
Ghostbusters," Visually dazzling and sporadically hilarious sci-fi comedy.
","`Ghostbusters' was released back in 1984 and now, nearing 20 years on, it is still as entertaining and witty as it was when it was first released. Yes, the early computer effects do look dated compared to today's standards, but the visual effects and puppetry are good for their own uniquely likeable style. This is backed up by the films cast who are all in top form. Bill Murray is brilliantly witty as Peter Venkman. The film's co-producer, Harold Ramis is also very good as the cynical and somewhat nerdy Ghostbuster, Egon Spengler. Dan Akroyd is well suited to his role as the rather unfortunate Ghostbuster of the bunch, Ray Stanz. Ernie Hudson doesn't receive quite as much screen-time or as much conviction as the other three, but handles his role as Winston Zedmore very well. Sigourney Weaver makes a great love interest and sterling support. The script couldn't be better either and perfectly balances modest comedy with big budget sci-fi. This has proved to be a hard mixture to get right in the past but works really well here. The distinctly 80's soundtrack is highly appropriate and surprisingly memorable. The film has its fair share of memorable scenes (who can forget the opening scene) and brilliantly witty dialogue (we came, we saw, we kicked a*s). The somewhat shoddy effects on the dog like creature, Zool, are well compensated for by the light show at the end and the famous `Stay-puff marshmallow man' scene.
Overall, `Ghostbusters' is a movie well deserving of its current status as a classic and is just as good (if not better) than the tear jerking `cinematic gems' of melodramatic drivel that has been released in the past. 8.2/10.",Null,0,0,21 March 2003
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A bit bizarre to say the least.
","I saw this film on the 23rd of December. It is now the 18th of January and I still don't know what to think of it. On the one hand, the stop motion techniques are brilliantly done and the voice cast works well together. Even the peculiar songs from the film are quite catchy.But then again it is a bit too dark and sometimes, downright creepy to be considered a Christmas movie. The characters are unique and it is cleverly written, but it is very cold hearted and probably won't appeal to the young.I still have mixed feelings but many of the other users seem to have enjoyed the film. Judge for yourself.",6,2,7,18 January 2003
Jerry Maguire," `Feel-good' comedy drama, best for it's brilliant performances.
","`Show me the money'. Cameron Crowe's breakout debut is good to say the least. `Jerry Maguire' is a soft-centred, romanticised and rather enjoyable character study of the struggle to return to the top. There's plenty of memorable dialogue along with a biting verbal. It's proud, if not boastful of its sometimes-arrogant style. It works best in its more comedic and satirical moments. The movie opens brilliantly and energetically and draws some modest laughs. However, this unique style is completely abandoned after the first 80 or so minutes and it gradually settles in familiar territory with lightly sentimental drama. The latter plunge isn't a huge mistake. It holds your interest and keeps the same pace, but isn't as good as the poignant first half.  The performances are what keeps this film alive and kicking. In an Oscar nominated turn, Tom Cruise loses the ego in one of his best roles to date. He is well suited to the title part and proves to his critics that he's more than just a shallow Hollywood star. Cuba Gooding Jnr. is ecstatic as the egotistical self-worshipping sports star. Renee Zellwegger perfectly balances comedy and drama in a breakthrough role that was done brilliantly. The three leads were enough to hold the film in its place but there's some good (if not irrelevant) support from the likes of Kelly Preston, Jay Mohr, Jerry O'Connell, Bonnie Hunt and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from Eric Stoltz. The script is also very sharp and imaginative and the finished product is better than the sum of its parts. There are some neat touches such as a man-eating divorced women's group and a male jazz obsessed child technician (male nanny). It builds up (perhaps too much) momentum and doesn't know what to do with it so gradually turns into a `too serious' drama at the halfway mark. This is a shame because had it not been for this, then I think it would have lived up to the entirety of its hype. Still though, `Jerry Maguire' is an intentionally inflated, but very enjoyable and very good for what it's worth. My IMDb rating: 6.8/10.",Null,1,4,16 May 2003
Mission: Impossible II," Big budget action yarn. OK, but nowhere near as good as the first one.
","A sequel to the original espionage thriller, M: I 2 goes along a completely different style, but fails to live up to its predecessor. The main reason for this is that a different director created it. While the first one was original, complex and thought provoking, M: I 2 takes on every cliché in the book. In the first one Tom Cruise was out for revenge, here he's on his `next mission'. The sequel tries much too hard to duplicate James Bond and far too little on script and storyline. Let's face it, the plot is a complicated muddle from start to finish. Tom Cruise takes on the lead role again but plays a completely different character. While in the first one he was a paranoid, unsettled and confused man, here he is a lot more focused, but overly slick and too much of a James Bond wannabe. Thandie Newton isn't a bad love interest, but doesn't do much to get past her one-dimensional demeanour. Dougray Scott is a relatively harmless villain and seems very inappropriate for the role.
The stunts are well done and the overall effect is good, but the film falls into much too many plot-holes to avoid. Many people have been criticising the `mask gimmick' but I thought it was quite cool, even if it was lifted straight out of the first one. Overall M: I 2 isn't bad but it isn't really that great either. A day after watching it you'll probably have forgotten about it. The fact that the series began on a level of spy game paranoia and then plummeted down to mindless action nonsense really is a downer. Because of this, the film fails to be much more then mediocre. 5.1/10.",Null,0,0,7 March 2003
The Insider," Mesmerising adaptation of a true story with outstanding performances.
","`The Insider' has been compared in many ways to `All The President's men', released in 1976. While I found both movies to be brilliant, I don't find them to be similar in any way. While `All the President's Men' was a factual, claustrophobic look at the uncovering of the Watergate scandal, `The Insider' is much more subjective and at times, a bit more compelling. Anyway, `The Insider' is an outstanding and continually fascinating look at this story that occurred not so many years ago. It's not very often that I can say this and mean it, but this is one of the few movies that is engaging for it's entirety, and at 158 minutes, that's quite an achievement. It's just a shame that the movie didn't receive international success it deserved. I wasn't very impressed with `Heat' (Michael Mann's last outing) so wasn't sure if this would be any good. Where I found `Heat' to be boring, `The Insider' was simply mesmerising. The flashy, shady directory techniques are magnificent and though this is a lot less murky and subtle than `All the President's Men' was, it still creates the desired effect. Backing up the excellent direction is outstanding acting from the lead actors.
The best performance comes from Russell Crowe in the first of his three nominations (Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind soon followed). His portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand is first rate and he proves he can lose the machismo for these quieter but very powerful roles. He definitely should have won the Oscar that year. Al Pacino does his familiar `grumpy determined' part but he's never done it with as much substance and pure gusto as he does it here. `Mr. Von Trapp'- Christopher Plummer, does his part quite well as the head of the network. Diane Venora plays her `good wife' part adequately but there isn't much material she has to work with. There's a big (if not un-necessary) supporting cast with average performances from the likes of Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Lindsay Crouse, Michael Gambon and Debi Mazar. What most surprises me is the fact that the movie was nominated for 8 Oscars and didn't win a single one. It definitely deserved to win Best Picture ahead of the pretentious, contrived and manipulative `American Beauty', let alone Best Actor and Best Director. `The Insider' is a brilliant and muchly under-rated account of the uncovering of the truth about the addictions of nicotine. It's just a shame that it didn't receive the huge audience it deserved. Definitely a film that deserves a reserved spot in the IMDb Top 100. My IMDb rating: 8.5/10.",10,0,1,6 June 2003
Quiz Show," Gripping fact-based drama,which is to the point but engaging nonetheless.
","Often underrated, 'Quiz Show' is a brilliantly detailed and well executed biopic of the infamously rigged quiz show '21'. The costumes, set designs and atmosphere echo that of the late 50's and the storyline is strong enough to keep you engrossed for the 2 hour running time. The acting is often overlooked, which is a shame because it is indeed brilliant. Perhaps John Turturro is overly nerdish as Herbert Stempel ( very nerdy name) but so was the character in real life. Rob Morrow is very convincing as the lawyer hunting for the truth, Mira Sorvino equally impressive as his wife. Impeccably English Ralph Fiennes is seen here in one of his breakthrough roles and is excellent as Charles Van Doren.
Periodic without being nostalgic, engaging without being over-long, thought provoking without being manipulative. Quiz Show works equally well at being a satire, a biopic and a courtroom drama. I give it 7.8/10.",10,2,2,8 March 2003
Toy Story," Superbly animated, brilliantly witty, instantly likeable and endlessly entertaining.
","The first ever fully computer generated movie, `Toy Story' really is a milestone in cinematic history. Enjoyed by young and old alike, this is funny even for the most bitter minded. After all, what's not to like? It isn't a three hour epic like `Gone With The Wind' but it is thoroughly entertaining for its eighty minute running time and hastily avoids wearing out its welcome. Not only is the animation brilliant but the characters are even better. Tom Hanks was perfectly chosen as the neurotic, jealous but easily likeable Woody. He proves that he can do comedy, even if he doesn't physically appear in the movie. Always reliable for his comedy, Tim Allen certainly delivers jokes at a rapid rate. And he perfectly fits into the role as Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry between the two main characters is priceless. Sure, they aren't `Bogart and Bacall' but they make a great duo. The supporting cast of characters include Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head and Little Bo Peep. They are brilliantly animated and while most of the limelight goes to Woody and Buzz, they still make good use of the scenes they're in.
The film was soon followed by a sequel `Toy Story 2' in '99. While the animation was more impressive and it was a bigger film, I still preferred the first one. Mainly because `Toy Story' had more chemistry between Woody and Buzz. But also because the sequel didn't have as many good laughs and aimed for boring sentimentality a bit too often. So overall, `Toy Story' is an outstanding breakthrough in the world of animation.  The comedy, visuals and level of enjoyment are all picture perfect. There are no flaws and the film barely ever makes a wrong move. 8.5/10.",10,0,0,18 April 2003
Singin' in the Rain," Still captures the magic....... but little else
","Lets be honest, Singin in the Rain hasn't stood the test of time very well. The jokes just aren't funny and are oudated. Compared to todays standards, the acting is disgraceful. The songs are very dated. But, strangely enough, this is still one of the best MGM musicals. The beauty lies in the exhuberant set design. Particularly in the Broadway fantasy scene. The colours and lights bounce off the screen and makes you want to be there. The title song's set is still colourful, so, despite its flaws (and there are plenty of them) this is still enjoyable, and not just for critical snobs. 7.9 out of 10.",8,1,7,12 January 2003
Toy Story 2," Not as funny, original or overall better than its predecessor
","I just noticed that Toy Story 2 has been voted in the Top 65 movies of all time. Hey up there, what are you thinking? OK, just here me out here for a second.Lets talk about Toy Story. It was the first completely 3-D movie ever made, truly a milestone in cinematic history. Sure, compared to the dazzling beauty of Final Fantasy and Shrek it may look dated, but its still a classic. Nothing can take that away from it.Toy Story 2 as a movie, not a sequel, is good. There are a few minor adjustments made to the animation to make it appear better but Woody, Buzz etc. wouldn't exist if it weren't for the original. First off, I think TS2 is a bit too long and overdrawn for an animated movie. Buzz could have been used a little more than he was, and the Emperor Zurg sub-plot was slightly bizzare and un-necessary.I liked the way the original was a buddy-buddy comedy which wasn't serious and didn't involve a romance as the basic plot. In TS2 it was way too predictable that Woody and Jessie would fall in love. The rendition of 'When She Loved Me' was the films downfall and an obvious flaw. It was totally un-needed and made the film more serious than it should have been.Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) was somewhat, a boring character and shouldn't have been used at all. Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar) never made a big impact and was a wasted chance. Buzz (Tim Allen) is as good as he was in the original but seemed too much like the supporting cast in this one. Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Slinky and Ham shuld have been used more. When the cast is too big the best characters don't get enough screentime. One thing the movie needed was a character that would bring chuckles everytime he/she spoke ie. Donkey in Shrek.Overall this is an adequate movie but an unsatisfactory sequel which seems to be aimed more at children than adults. 5 out of 10.",1,7,36,31 August 2002
Mission: Impossible," Glamourously paranoic espionage thrillerwhich manages to be both cleverly complex and highly original.
","A highly likeable movie, Mission: Impossible is a cleverly conceived thriller which demands close attention and is worthy of repeated viewings. The film's exotic cinematography is a real treat for the eyes and the plot never wears thin. With so many twists and turns, you will be constantly on the edge of your seat. Tom Cruise takes on the lead role and Mission: Impossible is the film that catapulted him to superstardom. He makes the film more appealing and is totally appropriate for the role. The rest of the cast work well together (its good to see Kristin Scott Thomas in an action movie) but it really is Cruise's film and he steals the spotlight for most of the film.
The fight scenes are well coreographed and you can see that a lot of work went into them. Of course, the film's most memorable scene is the 'suspended in mid-air, trying to hack into the computer' one. This scene is amazing in itself, but my favourite scene is the 'mission went wrong' at the beginning of the film. Perhaps the majority of the cast get killed off a bit too soon but I think it added to the overall effect. Clever, thought provoking and very entertaining, Mission Impossible is a very memorable film. 7.8/10.",Null,1,4,1 March 2003
A Clockwork Orange," Rape, ultra violence, Beethoven (???) call it what you want, this is just plain sick.
","An epic, a masterpiece?????? No, all 'A Clockwork Orange' is is sadistic porn. How can anyone say that Stanley Kubrick was a genius. He made either painfully boring films ('2001: A Space Oddessy, Barry Lyndon) or sickly psychotic ones (The Shining). 'A Clockwork Orange' is as unenjoyable and dislikeable as films come and you can't help but feel guilty watching it (and rightfully so). A Clockwork Orange is one of the most overrated and twisted movies of all time. If you want to see Malcom McDowell fully nude or brutal gang rapes and torture then watch this. If on the other hand you are normal, then stay away from A Clockwork Orange at all costs.",1,23,54,8 March 2003
Total Recall," Vibrant action and glitzy sets make a lavish spectacle.
","Paul Verhoeven's paranoid fantasy `Total Recall' is a dazzling futuristic sci-fi. The short story by Philip K. Dick is adapted brilliantly, and in many ways is similar to `Blade Runner'. The main difference is the fact that `Total Recall' is not sadistic, over-rated tripe. But there are many things that separate this from your average gung-ho action movie. Verhoeven's directing styles are marvellous and he creates a familiar, but gleaming vision of the near future.What's better than the brawny action is the Twilight Zone-ish atmosphere that is created. The film hits a peak when it reaches the half way mark and we don't know if this is reality or an artificially induced dream. Then again the movie is over-violent. This sometimes tarnishes the sparkling shine, but even the blood has that polished look to it and the stylish comic strip look certainly adds to the shimmering effect.The general acting standard is average if unremarkable. Arnold Schwarzanegger isn't the greatest actor, but he does the required job. Verhoeven regular, Ronny Cox is moderately good in his part as the standard villain, ditto Michael Ironside. Sharon Stone doesn't get enough screen-time, but is still very good as the vivacious wife. The same can't be said for Rachel Titocin, who is very shallow as the typical significant other.It's quite obvious that the standard of visual effects have drastically improved in the past 13 years, but the special effects in `Total Recall' are still spectacular. It's evident that the old technique of puppetry work is used, but the artists create the vast metropolis that was seen in recent blockbuster `Minority Report', but the settings are brighter, flashier and have an added dose of glitz. It's not very often that I can really say this, but this is a sci-fi movie with a brilliant script. There are enough added philosophical twists to dizzy the mind and alter everything that has gone before.In typical Philip K. Dick fashion, the film ends on a question mark. Was he really on Mars or was it part of the dream? The answer is for you to decide. The movie starts out brilliantly and continues up this slant until it reaches a peak at the half way mark (when he meets the man from Recall). After that it fizzles into action formula but retrieves its philosophical characteristics when we learn the truth about the movie's protagonist.One of the coolest, most vibrant and most violent science fiction movies in years, `Total Recall' is a fantastic demonstration that action movies can have brains. There is an equal measure of style and substance so I highly recommend this futuristic noir. My IMDb rating: 7.5/10.",Null,0,1,13 June 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," Empty, dull and painstakingly boring. A wasted opportunity for all concerned.
","The plot line sounded very good for this film. A dreamy, erotic oddessy through Manhattan's seedy underworld. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are the main stars. The film's atmospheric and moody teaser trailers made `Eyes Wide Shut' look a lot better than it actually was. The real result is subtle, boring drivel that only amounts to being a pathetic excuse for cheap pornography. I've never been a fan of Stanley Kubrick's movies and his last piece of completed work hasn't impressed me. There is no creativity in `Eyes Wide Shut', and nothing stands out among the evident dross. Yet people still call this man a genius; the mind boggles. Perhaps the film would have been much better had it been someone else, maybe Martin Scorsese. He's created a hellish yet vivid portrayal of New York in the past and I think he would have done a much better job. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's last pairing is indeed they're worst. The main problem is that any less popular actors could have easily replaced them. The chemistry between the two is convincing and ultimately believable, but they know that they could do with better material than this.
The pedestrian pace that the film takes and the slow, dull narrative fail to help it either. At 162 minutes, the plot and much-to-subtle dialogue are insufficient for it's length. Sure, Nicole Kidman looks good in her birthday suit, but there's little else good to remember about it. When it tries to be inventive it just ends up being plain weird. Very little can compensate for the misery and despair that it digs itself into. While it is an oddly interesting movie experience it's not one that you will have good memories of. Fans of Kubrick's earlier work might respect it, but most normal people will find this as repulsive as the south end of a magnet. For me `Eyes Wide Shut' is an overlong and hopeless misfire. 4.6/10.",7,0,1,11 April 2003
Pretty Woman," An overrated rom-com with no humour in sight.
","Did anyone else not like this film? I just can't see whats so good about it. Its very predictable, but thats not really the problem. Some scenes could have been much funnier than they were. Face it, 'Pretty Woman''s got chick flick written all over it.This film's supposed to leave you feeling great, it did absolutely nothing for me. I'm not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but I know that she didn't deserve that oscar nomination. Her performance wasn't at Oscar level and she used a stunt double for all of her gratuitously un-needed sex scenes.
It's not so bad, but I really didn't think it was all that good either. I saw nothing in 'Pretty Woman' and I thought it was very average. 5/10",Null,0,1,1 March 2003
Pulp Fiction," Funky, hyper kinetic, ultra-cool satire on crime.
","Often deemed as one of, if not the, best movie of the 1990's, Quentin Tarantino's deliberately humorous and violent satire on the sleazy underworld of Los Angeles certainly lives up to the hype. Often, similarly themed gangster movies can be slow in pace and boring in parts, but `Pulp Fiction' is delivered in such a slick, stylised manner that you won't notice the two and a half-hour running time pass by. The Oscar winning script is top-notch and brilliantly conceived. It's the jumping forward and back in time that makes the film work. Only at the end of the film do you realise in what order the events took place. And the interweaving and overlapping comes in the form of three vignettes. They used the term `series' of vignettes so that it would sound like more than three. It would have been smarter had it one or two more episodes, but as it is, all works quite well. The first is arguably the best. What makes this one work is the close attention to detail and memorable scenes that occur. The second story, `The Gold Watch' is also quite good. This is shuffled in second when it's actually how the film closes.
And the third vignette, `The Bonnie Situation' is probably the funniest of the three. Also thrown in there is the cafÃ© robbery involving `Pumpkin' and `Honeybunny'. The actors are given tremendous material to work with, but the huge ensemble cast is perfectly chosen and is probably the best since `Magnolia'. The lead star, John Travolta (Oscar nominated for his part), is always perfectly believable and brilliantly styled as hit man Vincent. But the performance isn't developed enough to consider above support. Samuel L. Jackson excellently portrays his counterpart, bible-bashing hit man Jules. Also lurking in there is Uma Thurman's exceptional delivery as the enigmatic, sassy femme fatale. Surprising is the fact that Bruce Willis got the most screen time yet received the coveted `and' credit.
Along with this, there is plenty of star-power from a supporting cast that would make Robert Altman weep. Harvey Keitel, Rosanna Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Christopher Walken, Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth round up the cast and all give ideal, noteworthy performances. Quentin Tarantino also does a near flawless job in the director's chair, bring just the correct amount of style, grit and humour. With quotable dialogue, memorable scenes and unforgettable characters `Pulp Fiction' is a near masterpiece. Working better in the more satirical moments, it probably isn't for the squeamish and definitely not for the easily offended. But if you want an offbeat, trendy ensemble thriller, then you won't go wrong with this. My IMDb rating: 8.5/10.",6,1,3,25 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Pretentious sci-fi sequel overloads on gadgetry, special effects and technobabble.
","`The Matrix' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `Twilight Zone'-ish manner. The general rule applies here- and this sequel doesn't match up to its predecessor. Worse than that, it doesn't even compare with it.
`Reloaded' explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion. In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after that, the film nose-dives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end. Worst of all is the overlong `Zion Rave' scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.
The bullet-time aspect of `The Matrix' was a good addition, but in `'Reloaded' they overuse to make it seem boring. In the first one there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically, just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is. It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better. It appears that `The Matrix' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `Star Wars' saga have.
The acting standard is poor for the most part. The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving's `Agent Smith'- the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all the special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress. A poor, thrown-together movie, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a disappointment. Those who didn't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it. This one's for die-hard fans only. Even in the movie's own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.) this is still rather poor. My IMDb rating: 4.5/10.",1,15,27,7 June 2003
Die Hard," The best thriller/disaster movie of all time.
","I can't believe this isn't in the top 50 thrillers of all time. Die Hard is a big budget action movie, with sophistication. Alan Rickman, who plays the film's German uber-baddie, really controls the part and brings in some blunt wit. Die Hard is the best and probably most violent of the trilogy. Endlessly entertaining and effortlessly rewatchable, Die Hard is a classic. 8.2 out of 10.",9,1,1,7 February 2003
Die Hard," The greatest thriller of all time.
","Die Hard is THE greatest thriller of all time. It also has THE greatest enemy of all time, (Alan Rickman is a genius). There have been many thrillers in recent times that are overdrawn, far too long and you want them to end very quickly, e.g.(the Negotiator, the Bone Collector). Luckily Die Hard is not classified as one of them. With an excellent plot, tremendous characters and a terrific atmosphere, Die Hard is one for the ages. 8.5 out of 10.",9,1,1,6 October 2002
Ice Age," Amazing, heartwarming, clever, hilarious, everything you could possibly want.
","Many critics and snobs say that this movie is adequate but doesn't compare with Monsters Inc and Shrek. Ice Age is much too under-estimated. It's better than Monsters Inc and just as good as Shrek. Perhaps the concept for the film may be familiar to the other two, but they were all in production at about the same time so you can't blame them for that.It is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and is always consistently entertaining. The visual gags and the wit should appeal to adults and children of all ages. While in Toy Story 2, serious scenes dragged the film down and made it lose momentum, in Ice Age moments of sentamentality are heartwarming and engaging. But if you have problems with your inner-child, thats not my problem.The cast may not be as well known as the vocal talents in Shrek, they still work perfectly together. Ray Romano exceeds Mike Myers (whose evident flaws were overlooked) as being the loner-like but lovable mammoth (Shrek was an ogre) and was highly appropriate for the part. No one will EVER match Eddie Murphy as the talking donkey, but John Lequizamo is a good contender as the comical sloth. Denis Leary is also very good. ER's Goran Visnijc is more of a Gene Hackman in 'Antz' than a John Lithgow in 'Shrek', and gives the film a darker mood instead of more comedy, which is fine in its own way.It follows a familiar outline, but Ice Age is always entertaining and definitely the best animated movie of 2002. 8.1 out of 10.",10,3,7,18 January 2003
Halloween," Artificial and overly cliched. So dated it's unintentionally funny.
","'Halloween' is not a classic. I don't know how anyone can say that it is. Yes, it did begin the genre of Horror in the 80's but that doesn't mean that this is any good. The film is now 25 years old and it shows. The murder scenes which take place look fake and as I said, it is sometimes unintentionally funny. Michael Myers, the Charlie Chaplin of serial killers, is just ridiculous and fails in striking fear in the viewer. The style in which he kills his victims is so unconvincing you could nearly laugh at it.
Overall, 'Halloween' tries to hard to be an intelligent horror movie and fails miserably in its attempts. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is subtle and boring and the murder scenes are just funny. 4.7/10.",4,3,11,9 March 2003
Back to the Future Part II," Not as imaginative as Part 1, but still good fun.
","Back To The Future Part 2 takes place immediately after Part 1 stopped. When Marty lands in 2015, the scene is very familiar to the one in 1955, which took place in the first one. The irony is quite amusing, but you can tell that little thought went into it. And when he returns to 1955, a lot of footage from the first one is reused, or some extra things are put in the background. In this world, everyone get's married at 30 years, for some odd reason. However, BTTF2 is still a very enjoyable and adequate sequel to Part 1 and although it may not be at classic status, it's still good fun. Slightly better than the third part to the trilogy, I give it a 7.1 out of 10.",Null,0,0,26 January 2003
Shrek," the best and most colourful 3-D movie ever!
","I watched Shrek yesterday and I can freely admit that it is the best 3-D movie ever! All the characters are excellent.Mike Myers gives a semi-take on his Fat Bastard and Stuart McKenzie(So I Married An Axe Murderer) characters as the ogre, Shrek. Eddie Murphy is by far the best character in Shrek, as the motor mouth Donkey. Cameron Diaz(Princess Fiona) gives a good spin on the average fairytale princess. John Lithgow is the best enemy that could have been picked and I hope he returns in the sequel. I just hope they don't do the Toy Story 2 on the sequel and make it a sappy,overdrawn presentation squarely aimed at children.",10,0,2,24 August 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Intense, gruesome and complex but a tad overrated horror/thriller.
","The film that began the world famous Hannibal Lector character is a very good one indeed. But I don't think that it lives up to the full quantity of its hype. The two leads deserved the Oscars they won back in 1991 but I don't think that the film deserved any more than that.
Nonetheless, the quality of acting from these two leads is outstanding. At 28 she was already an accomplished actress so Jodie Foster perfectly captures the role of hesitantly determined detective Clarice Starling. It's hard to believe that the Hannibal Lector part was offered to so many other actors before Anthony Hopkins was rightfully offered the role. He creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 20th Century and is brilliant for the part. It's a shame that the same can't be said about the rest of the performances. Ted Levine, one of the most overlooked actors in the past 20 years, never receives any conviction in his role, offers us no motive, and is just plain dull in his part. No background is offered to his character and is much inferior to Ralph Fiennes character in the recently made prequel, `Red Dragon'. Scott Glenn soon gave up `the method' after he proved to be a dud. Apparently, he sat in a room for hours everyday listening to the sounds of killers torturing their victims, so he could prepare for the role. Too bad that what we see on screen is something less professional.
One thing that the film does succeed in doing is intensifying scenes so as you don't know what will happen next. It gets gratuitously visceral in some scenes to try and be humane, but just looks gruesome and unattractive. While the story is complex and the film ends so as most people will be satisfied, I didn't see much else of `sheer brilliance' about it.
Maybe it's just me or maybe this is a needlessly overrated film. But still, `The Silence of the Lambs' is a very good horror/thriller that well outshines its disastrous sequel `Hannibal'. 7.5/10.",10,3,5,21 March 2003
Vanilla Sky," Excellent!!!
","There is no way of summarising this film. But to be very brief, Vanilla Sky is filmmaking at its very best. Here is my overall statement in regards to it; I truly loved this film. Vanilla Sky really got 2002 off to a great start. Lets start with the acting.Asides for Oceans Eleven, (another great movie), Vanilla Sky has the best ensemble cast so far this year. First of all, Tom Cruise is the film's shining light. He plays the `Citizen Dildo', rich playboy part and the Elephant Man part supremely. And deserves an Oscar nomination, at least. Penelope Cruz gives a very credible performance and her relationship with Cruise off-screen was a further benefit towards the film. Cameron Diaz is only in the first 40 minutes of the film and any other time she appears in the film, there's something strange going on. Otherwise she's fairly good. Jason Lee, though initially unkempt, is perfect with his `2nd best' character. Kurt Russell gives another top-notch performance, this time as a sympathetic psychiatrist. There are other parts in the film varying from cameos to big rolls. Among these are Noah Taylor, Timothy Spall, Tilda Swilton, Alicia Witt and Steven Spielberg. So, the film has a strong cast and some excellent performances.Followed up by this is some impeccable directing. Cameron Crowe does an excellent job and creates a masterpiece.Vanilla Sky is divided up into 3 parts. For the first 40 minutes it's a witty, romantic slice of life with a thrilling finish. For the next 45 minutes it's a gloomy, dramatic, psychological thriller. The least of the 3 parts. And, the 3rd part. For the final 45 minutes, Vanilla Sky is a mystery thriller cum sci-fi drama.PLOT SPOILERS I liked the twist in the end. I'm well aware that its caused controversy, but I think that a sci-fi twist was the way to go. Without the cryogenation-half-way-through-the-movie, the film would not have worked. It explains everything, so that there's no questions asked. It also leaves you asking questions about philosophy and reality, afterwards. SPOILERS ENDIt covers SO many genres. It's a drama, thriller, romance, mystery, noir, comedy and a sci-fi. In conclusion, if you have a short attention span and/or are a sarcastic, moronic cynic, then don't watch Vanilla Sky. Otherwise, rent it NOW. 10/10.",10,0,1,1 November 2002
Blade Runner," What Ridley Scott has done to this film is inhuman.
","I recently saw the directors cut of this film. After about 75 minutes I couldn't bare to watch this atrocity any longer. It sounded as though it would be an amazing film. LA in the future. Robots running wild. Gaudy neon lit streets in a hellish future. I was convinced that this would be brilliant, but alas, how wrong I was.There are periods of up to ten minutes when there is complete silence. This is supposed to be tension but it is excruciatingly boring. The acting is even worse, in particular Daryl Hannah's performance. And the script is absolutely atrocious. This film would have been SO much better if it was directed by someone else, maybe James Cameron or Robert Zemeckis.

Bruce Almighty," Goofball comedy high on imagination, despite a poor conclusion.
","After hit-and-miss movies like `Man on the Moon' and `The Majestic', it's good to see rubber-faced Jim Carrey back to the genre he does best- screwball comedy. Particularly when the plot is as eye catching and promising as this- a man is given the power of God. This paves the way for plenty of hilarious antics and situations. Just too bad that the opening fifteen- twenty minutes are so slow to get going (bar the hilarious `Niagara Falls' sequence). But after the protagonist receives the power of God, the jokes kick in and the film continues to build more and more momentum as the hilarious scenes pile up. There are certain scenes that will have you in stitches laughing, but it would be unfair to give them away. I just wish the trailers wouldn't give away so much of them. The subplots are really only a skeleton to keep the movie bound and in place, everything else comes from the gags. The visual effects and trick photography are surprisingly impressive as well. But when you take away all the gags and special effects, the movie is only a bit of gas. Then again, that's all we're really expecting out of it.
However, there is one simply unforgivable plot-hole that the film falls into. It packs all of the jokes into about into the middle fifty or so minutes and completely runs out of ideas in the third part. It becomes the sentimental `rom-com without the com' that it promised us it wouldn't be. This has happened before in high concept movies like `In & Out' when the blandness of the all-too-serious scenes sets in. That's a terrible shame because, had it had two or three more jokes, or maybe spaced them out a bit more, this would have been a better film. Thankfully, Jim Carrey is on the top-form that we hoped he'd be in for his long expected return to comedy. No other actor could pull off this part with quite as much flexibility as Carrey does, and he does a great job. The same thing cannot Jennifer Aniston who doesn't prove to be anything the `Rachel Green' that we are very familiar with. Woefully unchallenged and nothing we haven't seen before, this could have easily been pulled off by any other lesser-known actress. Standard support from Philip Baker Hall (Magnolia, The Rock), Catherine Bell and Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Shawshank Redemption) as He Almighty. It really is a shame that the film shamelessly plummeted into a downward spiral in the final third. But the middle part is undeniably funny; so all in all, this is a funny (if not groundbreaking) comedy movie. My IMDb rating: 6.0/10.",Null,0,1,27 June 2003
Space Jam," Wacky live-action perfectly blends with slapstick animation to make a great movie for young and old alike.
","`Space Jam' is an impressive and genuinely humorous movie with the Loony Toon characters and actors all on top form. The plot is an attractive one and the overall effect is a generally agreeable one. While the animated scenes are more superior to the plain live-action ones, both are equally enjoyable. But the film is best when it mixes these styles as it transports Michael Jordan into the Loony Toon world. It's real candy for the eyes and makes the movie a visual treat. This blend has proved to be hit (Song of the South, Who Framed Roger Rabbit) and miss (The Pagemaster) in the past, but `Space Jam' is one of the better ones. The main star of the film is Basketball star, Michael Jordan. He isn't a professional actor but all of his in-experience and flaws go by relatively un-noticed. But Theresa Randle, the weasly Wayne Knight and the always-reliable Bill Murray ably support him. The Loony Toon characters are all on top-form aswell. I don't think the antics of the likes of Bugs Bunny, Taz, Sylvester, Tweedy, Foghorn Leghorn, Daffy and the rest of the gang will ever get old. Newcomer, Lola Bunny is a very welcome addition to the group aswell. The enemies of the movie are all equally likeable as the basketball rivals. The only flaw the film has is the R. Kelly theme song. It seems inappropriate to say the least, even if it is memorable. The basketball game conclusion is very imaginative and there are even great puns on `Pulp Fiction' and `Ghostbusters' in it. It brings the film to satisfying and appropriate conclusion. There's witty dialogue, stunning visuals, likeable characters, a great title and plenty else to keep you entertained. `Space Jam' hits a lot more times than it misses and is the best animation/reality crossover film in a long time. I give it 7.3/10.",Null,0,2,11 April 2003
Signs," Chilling, dramatic and compelling tale with some terrific directing.
","(WARNING: MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS.) Signs is a tremendous movie. Its cuts to the chase very quickly but still holds great tension and is very effective. OK, there isn't a twist in the end, but so what. When I was watching the movie I kept thinking,'the twist is coming any minute now'. But then I realised that a twist wasn't the way to go. It would establish Shamalyan as being a one-dimensional director who can only direct the one kind of movie. Well I'm glad that Signs broke the link, its all for the better.The acting is limited but works very well with what it has. Its leads Gibson and Phoenix are excellent. Luckily, the children aren't typical brattish swines,ie. Spy Kids. And thank the Lord they aren't cocky snobs either, ie. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson. M. Night Shamalyan even has a small part in the film and has developed a good American accent, (speech coaches, a plenty).I enjoyed Signs just as much as I liked Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense. I can't wait for his next movie. 8.2 out of 10.",8,0,2,20 September 2002
X2: X-Men United," Fabulously stylised, superior sequel to a terrific predecessor.
","`X2' is the fourth in line in this new series of movies, revitalising the old comic strip superhero genre. It began with big hits like `Superman' and `Batman' along with smaller ones such as `The Punisher' and `The Flash'. After `X-Men', `Spider-Man' and `Daredevil' comes this, which is the best of them so far. This means that the ones still to come such as `The Hulk' and `Spider-Man 2' have big shoes to fill. `X2' beats out all of the mentioned films in nearly every way. With so many characters, the film is continuously compelling and they are all equally likeable. The performances are standard, as expected. There are some clashes of acting styles that sometimes tend to get in the way. There's the royalty of Sirs Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, the teenage kitsch of Anna Paquin and Shawn Ashmore, and the mainstream styles such as Halle Berry and James Marsden. This mixed bag works surprisingly well as an ensemble cast rather than a group of individuals. Stewart and McKellen are right on the mark, bringing the film some class. Hugh Jackman was the best choice for the part of Wolverine and does his part just as well as he did the first time. Famke Janssen looks the part and does a pretty good job as the sultry seductive Jean Grey. Likewise for hubby Cyclops played by James Marsden. He doesn't get a lot of time on the screen but ironically develops more. Anna Paquin doesn't get much of a chance to do much else other than stand in the background. That's a shame because she was brilliant in the first one as the vulnerable action chick. The rest of the performances from the likes of Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Kelly Hu, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming and Halle Berry are good aswell. It's a shame that Tyler Mane and Ray Park couldn't return because they were great in the first one. But the word on the street is that they've signed on for X3 so all is forgiven.
In the high tech world of today, it's expected that the visual effects in movies should be top class. X2 goes as far as to push the limits of computer generated possibilities. The effects are a consistent treat for the eyes and there are even some really cool camera angles. The final third is made up of the climactic fight scenes. It all boils down to a shockingly tragic conclusion. However, if you've read the comic, you'd know that there is a shimmering light at the end of the tunnel. X3 will have to be absolutely outstanding in order to surpass this. With cool characters, superb visuals, a great cast and good subplots, is quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made. It doesn't fall flat under the weight of its some 15 characters or large numbers of subplots. My IMDb rating: 8.3/10.",Null,0,0,5 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," Quiet power lurks amidst the subtly fear-invoking atmosphere.
","PLOT SPOILERM. Night Shyamalan makes a brilliant directorial debut in this chiller-drama focusing on the Sixth Sense of the title. Not only does it bring about the required scares, but also it equally backs this up with some brilliant acting from all concerned. The film has that haunting, suspenseful atmosphere, as you really don't know what will happen next. But the one problem that has occurred in Shyamalan's film so far is the limited re-watchable factor. While at first it appears to be unpredictable and suspenseful, second time round you will notice the long gap between scares and the film loses it's intended atmosphere.
But the quality of the acting will never wear thin. Bruce Willis defies his critics and proves that he can act, giving a humane performance as Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Though lacking in experience, Haley Joel Osment is brilliant as the disturbed, depressed kid, and deserved the Oscar which he didn't win. Olivia Williams and Toni Colette make good support in their respective roles. `The Sixth Sense' is most famous for its HUGE twist in the end. In some ways it was good and a smart way to conclude the film, but then again it doesn't make logical sense and is unintentionally funny. I mean, Bruce Willis' character was dead for nearly a year and he hadn't noticed. What a dunce!
But in retrospect, `The Sixth Sense' is a haunting, subtle and brilliant piece of work that will live long in the memory. 7.9/10.",7,0,0,18 April 2003
The Truman Show," One of the most original ideas to come out of Hollywood in a long time.
","The Truman Show is a fresh and thought provoking comedy, with some excellent acting, directing and scripting. It's a very simple concept and is a bit slow to start off but after the first fifteen minutes it reaches a climax and continues on that note for the rest of the movie. The acting is great all across the board, (Jim Carrey's best film to date). The films humour flows naturally and the drama is very gripping. Indeed The Truman Show is one of those few films that doesn't rely on special effects and a huge budget to be a great film. 8.1 out of 10.",9,0,1,7 February 2003
Heat," I didn't like it- OH MY GOD I MUST BE STUPID!!!!!!!
","That's correct; it is a sin not to like `Heat'. Anyone who doesn't like this film should be critically flogged, beaten and crucified. Every critic in the last century is right and we are not entitled to our own personal opinions. If you haven't noticed yet, I'm being sarcastic. I just didn't get `Heat'. I didn't see anything particularly good about it. The dialogue is boring, unmemorable and too subtle to notice. The film's only aim was to get Al Pacino and Robert De Niro (two world class actors) on screen. They succeed in doing this, but surround the actors with a whole lot of irrelevant material and a bad script. The main problem was that it had a huge supporting cast (and I mean HUGE) that had little to do with the plot, were undeveloped and just wasted valuable screen time. Val Kilmer, who was the third actor credited, never got any conviction and was more of a decoration than a supporting actor. The rest of the easily over-seeable cast act as stand ins and get very little screen time. The end scene with Pacino and De Niro is nicely executed, but that's about the only damn good thing about the film. I certainly wouldn't consider it an epic and overall, I thought it was nothing more than mediocre. 4.9/10.",Null,0,0,7 March 2003
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Gothic horror with magnificent art direction despite a limp narrative.
","`Dangerous Liaisons' meets `Fright Night' in this lavish, over-dressed horror drama. This genre of costume piece-cum-gory horror certainly is an acquired taste to say the least. While it has a `hip' quality to it, the movie is also subtle and sophisticated- not simply a mindless action flick. In fact it could not be further from being an action movie. `Interview with the Vampire' is done in the same style as `Bram Stoker's Dracula' made in 1991. It has familiar props, but a slightly stronger narrative.
Of course, one huge flaw is the homo-erotic overtones, which are made so disturbingly obvious throughout the film. While these may be in tone with the period in question, they make the movie all the harder to sit through and for the most part are unintentionally funny. Even in the most serious scenes, it's hard to resist laughing at the effeminacy of all the characters. If someone dressed like that in the modern era they'd simply be laughed at (deservedly). I mean, let's face it- there's vampirism, and there's just plain gay! `InterviewÂ…' crosses that fine line one too many times. Good solid performances from the entire cast, in particular from Tom Cruise. Those expecting the hotshot egotist from `Risky Business' and `Top Gun' will be in for a humble surprise. He creates a bizarre, disturbing, unintentionally funny, highly effeminate yet ultimately compelling character that wouldn't have been done quite as brilliantly by anyone else. He handles the simplest roles and the more complex ones with equal va-va-voom. A very girl-ish Brad Pitt is convincing as the vampire of the title.
Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea are appropriately creepy in their parts but don't get much of a chance to flesh out their characters. Christian Slater is good as the freaked-out interviewer but, again, doesn't properly develop his character. The surprise talent is from a very young Kirsten Dunst as the child/student/vampire/part-time lover (now THAT is weird). She should get more talented roles in the future and a departure from kitschy sophomoric material. The narrative and dialogue are below par and simply can't support the movie. Luckily, the real stars of the movie are the magnificent set pieces and costume designs- kudos to art director Dante Ferretti. Lurking in the background is the Oscar nominated soundtrack from Elliot Goldthenal (who won this year for `Frida'). It sets an appropriately moody and atmospheric tone- well paced and impeccable timed. Anna Rice did a good job adapting the screenplay, though perhaps it gets ahead of itself in parts, assuming that we know how it feels to be a vampire. In conclusion, `Interview with the Vampire' isn't for all tastes, but if you stick with it you'll probably be pleased. Unusual is the fact that the movie ends with Guns' N' Roses playing in the background. This is certainly strange, but it leaves a satisfying taste in the mouth when all is done. My IMDb rating: 6.8/10.",Null,0,1,20 June 2003
Gangs of New York," Grim, violent, but brilliantly detailed and moving epic drama.
","Pretty much ignored at the Oscars this year, `Gangs of New York' deserved a bit more of the Academy's attention than it received. Twenty-five years in the making, it was worth the wait as the finished product is quite a good one. This is classic Scorsese given a periodic setting: lowlifes, hellish streets, and crime-filled landscapes. It is also a superb follow-up to Scorsese's last outing- the equally impressive `Bringing out the Dead'.
Given the technology in the hectic world of today, `Gangs of New York' wouldn't have been pulled off with quite as oomph had it been made 20-25 years ago. Digital effects were very sparse back then, and cardboard studio settings would seem obvious. The recreation of the Five Points is magnificent to say the least. Truly, one of the best works in cinematography, set decoration and art direction to date. But this is too be discarded as a `technically impressive movie' (The Matrix, Star Wars etc.), as the narrative that follows is a strong one that holds up well against the booming shadows of the set pieces. But the real star here is Martin Scorsese and his mesmerising sleight of hand. Perhaps a bit too gritty and violent, but he runs this show and brings back the vividly hellish, dank New York landscape that know other director can pull-off quite as well. He was the most deserving nominee at the Oscars and by all means should have won. Being from Ireland myself, the accents are hard to judge. I find it ironic how most of the American actors (John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas etc.) were given `Oirish' accents, while most Irish actors (Daniel Day Lewis, Jim Broadbent etc.) were given American accents.
Some performances are good but others are hard to judge. The lead `average Joe' part goes to Leo DiCaprio. He does the best job with the material he is given, and isn't half-bad, but this probably isn't his finest hour to make the role his own. His accent comes and goes to a very vague effect. The same applies to Cameron Diaz. She gave the part her all, but she's much better at the lighter roles, and the accent is undefined. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is a bit of an enigma. Occasionally good in the operatically menacing role, in others he is just too hammy. He sticks to the `New Yawkish' accent throughout, but that is very hard to comprehend. The Irish accent was much more convincing in all his other films. In fairness, it is a dead-on impression of William Cutting, but simply too farfetched and often over-the-top to have deserved the Oscar. Supporting performances are quite good from the likes of Brendan Gleeson, Jim Broadbent and Henry Thomas. But you get the strong feeling that much of the scenes with John C. Reilly (Magnolia, The Hours) and Cara Seymour (American Psycho, Adaptation) were left on the cutting room floor. Another flaw is the fact the movie is simply too long. After the `Leo-recovering-in-the-cave' scene it loses much of its momentum. Certainly not one for the squeamish, `Gangs of New York' is still a powerful epic that deserved at least three wins out of the ten Oscar nominations it received (particularly Best Director). Visually impressive but also deep and meaningful, this is a superbly detailed and often under-appreciated picture. My IMDb rating: 7.4/10.",Null,0,0,2 July 2003
Gladiator," Powerful, outstanding and periodic take on Ancient Rome.
","The new millenniums response to `Spartacus' and the more successful `Ben Hur' proves to match up to, if not outshine those films levels and raises the bar even further. After the risible and derivative `Hannibal' Ridley Scott swiftly redeems himself with his stylish and impeccable direction in `Gladiator'. I've never been a big fan of his work (I think `Blade Runner' and `Alien' are among the most overrated movies of all time) but this proves to me that he is a good director. The cinematography is sheer brilliance and the recreation of the Colosseum is magnificent. The rest of the settings are indeed superb and the play of dark shade on Rome adds to the atmosphere. The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive and accurately timed. The acting standard is also very good and there are great performances all round. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar he received. Jaoquin Phoenix is dark and moody, as the evil Emperor Commodus (seems a bit like a take-off of Nero). Connie Nielson gives a much needed, international break-through role.
The good thing is that `Gladiator' balances out drama with gruesome battles. There is enough blood here to please all `bloodsporting actioners' yet plenty of drama to enlighten the `cinematic elite'. So overall, Gladiator was well deserving of its Best Picture Academy Award and goes for enjoyable fiction instead boring facts and figures. 7.9/10.",9,1,2,21 March 2003
Contact," Awe-inspiring, fascinating science fiction drama.
","`Contact' is one of the most thought-provoking, realistic and remarkable movies I have seen in quite a while. It falls into the often-ignored sub-genre of the sci-fi drama. Of course this is something which isn't attempted very often, because it is so hard to get the mixture just right. On a normal basis, the science fiction movie is a gung-ho `man vs. aliens' affair, but it could not be further away from that in `Contact'. This is truly one of the most intelligent, remarkably executed sci-fi movies you will see in quite a while.It is the thinking mans movie, but that's not to say that it's anything like the over-rated and often pretentious `2001: A Space Oddessy'. Unlike that picture, `Contact' engages the mind from the very start- and a fantastic opening at that. We see the planets flying past as we move further and further away from the Sun, whilst gradually hearing a radio signal move back in time until it eventually disappears. This is a very hard act to follow, but it maintains that thrilling peak for the entire 153 minute running time. The pace is a noticeably slow one, but that adds to the degree of intensity and interest. I have always been a fan of Robert Zemeckis' movies and this is right up there with `Back to the Future' as one of his best movies. Mastered almost every genre by now, he perfectly balances science fiction and drama, science and religion, interest and thrill, satisfaction and entertainment. Of course all other supporting work from behind the camera is as good as one could possibly expect. A brilliant, but and always evident score plays throughout, courtesy of Alan Silvestri. The cinematography and art direction were always going to be a hard thing to handle in a film like this. It is a serious and realistic sci-fi that has to lose the gung-ho effect. The serenity of space and the planet `Vega' is a consistent treat for the eyes and a tranquil image (different from the one that we're probably used to).
Backing this is up is superb and consistently humane performances from the cast. Obviously leading the pack is Jodie Foster giving yet another mesmerising performances. While this type of film wouldn't be considered as an actor's piece, she brings just the right amount of gusto, determination and deep down vulnerability. This is definitely one of Matthew McConaughey's better movies- far superior to the likes of `EDtv' and `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'. Tremendous support from the likes of Tom Skerritt (Alien, Top Gun), James Woods, Angela Bassett, David Morse, John Hurt, Rob Lowe and William Fichtner. Also a bunch of cameos from CNN presenters, reporters, scientist, even Bill Clinton himself! It's original and highly convincing how they digitally added him in to certain scenes, instead of using some fictitious President. A realistic, thought-provoking and often astonishing piece of work, `Contact' is one of the best science fiction movies in years. If you want an `Independence Day' like action movie working on the principle of `Die- aliens-die!' then this probably isn't the film for you. Otherwise, this is a remarkable, unpretentious piece of work that should rightfully be in the IMDb Top 250. My IMDb rating: 8.1/10.",Null,5,11,2 July 2003
Back to the Future," A definitive classic
","17 years on since when it was released, Back To The Future still captures the brilliance it did back in 1985.Though, to be honest, I am disappointed that it is not in the top 100. Giving that films such as the highly overrated and outdated Citizen Kane is no.6.It has a very simple plot (if you take out. the time travelling) and brings about an excellent sense of nostalgia. The cast works perfectly together. The soundtrack is very effective, from Mr. Sandman to The Power of Love. Even the special effects are good for its day.Back to the Future still remains one of the best films ever made. 8.5 out of 10. (Marking films the way IMDb would).",10,1,2,12 January 2003
Beetlejuice," Dark and imaginative tale which is worth watching over and over again.
","Tim Burton is a genius.Beetlejuice may not be groundbreaking, but its definitely an original and amusing movie worth watching plenty of times.Michael Keaton is in over-the-top form as Beetleguese. Alec Baldwin holds a very likeable character as Adam Maitland. And likewise for Geena Davis (great actress). Winona Ryder is excellent in one of her earliest performances and somewhat resembles Ally Sheedy in the Breakfast Club.The films directing is truly a golden gem and Tim Burton is at his best. Don't expect too much comedy from Beetlejuice as its more of a fantasy than anything else, although some scenes are riotous.Overall this is a highly amusing and cleverly made movie, 7 out of 10.",8,1,2,14 September 2002
All the President's Men," Absorbing, fact based drama. Clever, well acted and brilliantly executed.
","When real life events are transferred to the big screen, the result can be hit and miss. The main problem is that facts can be stretched to (attempt to) make it better and they can also be over indulgent and much to romanticised. Luckily, `All the President's Men' avoids this problem, presenting us with a factual and interesting story involving the infamous Watergate scandal with Ex-President Richard Nixon. The film doesn't let emotions get in the way and is strictly objective, which in this case, is a good thing. The premise is as predictable as Antarctic weather, but we're supposed to know the result before going in to watch it.
The movie gets its beauty from the ways that the two reporters uncover the truth. The tactics and actions are intelligent and fascinating to watch. At some points, the film seems a little thin though, and the paranoia isn't enough to carry it. But as twists and plot revelations occur, it gradually sucks you into the story. There is also a murky but deeply in-tone atmosphere that surrounds the proceedings. There is no soundtrack and no songs occur during the duration. This adds to the `documentary-ish' atmosphere but doesn't help build the intensity along the way.
The story alone holds your attention for a good while but loses its way about 10 minutes from the end. Nevertheless, it's nice to see that the paranoia is finally justified. The only other noticeable flaw is that it may be politically correct, but lacks bite; something that similar political documentary director Oliver Stone greatly succeeds at when he attempts to `shatter' the American Dream. There are great performances from Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in the leads. At the same time though, this calibre of roles, which do not require emotional power aren't very challenging but the duo pull it off with the greatest ease in the respective parts as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. It's a shame that the same can't be said about the support. Jason Robards did not deserve the Academy Award he won for his un-challenging role as the editor of the company. But the rest of the cast including Jack Warden, Hal Holbrook, Jane Alexander and Ned Beatty give standard performances.
Despite some faults, `All the President's Men' excels with equal stamina in being a paranoiac political thriller along with an objective documentary/ character study. It lacks bite, but it more then compensates with energy and interest. My IMDb rating: 7.1/10.",10,1,1,9 May 2003
The Wizard of Oz," Whimsical, musical and magical. Still as enjoyable as it was 60+ years ago
","The Wizard Of Oz is MGM Magic. The first film to use glorious technicolour. OK, so maybe it is overacted compared to todays standards but then again, acting isn't really the film's strongpoint. The film get's it's magic in the beautiful and colourful set design and also in the dazzling costumes.
The black and white scenes are a little dull, but there is more than enough to compensate. The film's songs are dated, but still highly memorable.(Who can ever forget Follow the Yellow Brick Road). It's very easy to be cynical about The Wizard Of Oz, but it's still the classic it was nearly 65 years ago.",10,2,3,25 January 2003
