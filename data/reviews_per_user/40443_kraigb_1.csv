The Blair Witch Project," Not very scary
",My problem with the film is that it just isn't that scary. Therewere 2 scenes that gave me a little chill-that's it.  The ideawas brilliant.  The actors are superb-completely believable. Thefilmmakers are to be applauded.  So I definitely recommend themovie.  We need to reward efforts like this.  Just don't expectto be terrified.,7,0,1,31 July 1999
