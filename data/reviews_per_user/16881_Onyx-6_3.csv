The Blair Witch Project," A new defenition of horror films.
","I just saw The Blair Witch Project last night. As I was falling asleep ,the images kept running through my mind...especialy the final image you see in the film. The funny thing is there are no real images, it was played out all in my head. As you watch this movie, you feel the frustration and horror the characters feel. The style of this film realy pushes you to use your imagination, even though there are times in the film when you don't want to, but are draw in to. The camcorder makes you feel that these are your friends and your watching their home movie. In a nutshell, this movie has no special effects, no background music and no gore. It has something worse.....YOUR imagination. Go see it **********",10,1,2,31 July 1999
Spider-Man 2," I wanted Mary Jane to die.
","Okay let me just make this quick. The heroes and bad guys are fun. The film needed more of that. I wasn't sold on the love story. In fact it ruined the film for me. OOOHHHHH my god what a pain in the neck that MJ is. Every time she showed her face I wanted to slice my wrists. The movie is like a roller coaster - fun, boring, fun, boring, boring, fun. The boring parts are all MJ. I was close to cheering when I thought she was gone for good. I was hoping Dr. Octopus would kill her. And for the love of God Spidey keep the mask on. The secret identity of a super hero is the #1 rule and audiences like it. Over-all the movie had an over whelming scent of cheesiness. I'll give it a 6/10 I liked the original one better.Want to watch a great comic book movie go watch X2.",Null,0,0,5 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," True to the Book
","This movie is just like the books....BORING....snooze...oh boy! If your in to fantasy your a geek. But you'll like it. This movie can cure insomnia. What is the big deal. I read all the books when I was a kid. I must admit..they were okay, but you have to admit they are not the most exciting stories around. BORING. That is my review. This movie does not suck it's just BORING.",Null,0,0,2 March 2002
