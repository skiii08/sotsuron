Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) - Review
","I had only seen Star Wars for the first time when the special edition's came out in 1997 but I fell in love instantly. The summer of 1999 rolled around and Star Wars fever was everywhere, the hype was insane and I was just young enough at the time that I enjoyed the hell out of the prequels when they were coming out. I can certainly be objective about them now though, lets dig into the The Phantom Menace. So here we are, the beginning of the epic Star Wars saga, I gonna start with my biggest problem with this film, it should never have existed. By that I mean that I think the prequel trilogy should have started where Episode 2 did, we didn't need to see Anakin as a child, the film did a good job of showing him as kind and selfless this could have been done another way. The central conflict of the movie, the invasion of Naboo, also comes off as kinda pointless, it's a very contained incident that has little to do with what happens in the rest of the trilogy. The issues are further exacerbated by the time jump between this film and Episode 2. That said though, if you pull your focus in, the story isn't so bad, classic fight for freedom just on a planetary scale instead of the galactic stakes we're used to and with way more boring politics that we're used to as well.It's really hard to rate the cast in this because they are all saddled with such terrible dialogue most of the time, that being said though I really liked Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. There was a great nobleness to his character and he was better at delivering the bad dialogue than most. Ewan McGreggor was equally good here, he brought the youthful side to a character that we had only known as old and wise before, his relationship with Qui-Gon was also a highlight. Natalie Portman was alright but what was the deal with her put on Queen voice, it was odd, also I don't buy her as a 14 year old nor do I get why a society would ever elect a 14 year old as the ruler of an entire planet.Jake Lloyd is about as terrible as child actors come but again, woeful dialogue is to blame a lot of the time here too, he does sell the goodness of Anakin well enough though. Ian McDiarmid is a highlight, reprising his character from the original trilogy, watching his manipulations of everyone around him is one of the highlights of the film and the trilogy as a whole. Anthony Daniels, I think the only actor to be in all six films is pretty good as usual, he knows the character of C-3PO inside out at this point. Having Anakin be the creator of C-3PO though is a huge mistake and an unnecessary attempt to tie the universe together, all it does is make the universe seem smaller.The best thing about this film, Darth Maul, what a bad ass, he was truly a menacing villain. He didn't say much which made him appear even more scary and the actors martial arts skills really put the action on another level. Speaking of the action, it was pretty good, the final battle was pretty great, it intercut between the ground battle, the space battle and the now famous lightsaber duel much like Return of the Jedi did. That duel is really impressive still, it's not as overly choreographed as some the duels that followed it and it has a great emotional ending with Qui-Gon's death and Obi- Wan's rage fulled assault on Maul, definitely the high point of the film.Why was Darth Maul killed off though, that has to be the biggest misstep of the film, he should have been kept around for the whole trilogy, what a waste. At least he has since been resurrected in cartoon form.A big talking point around the prequels has always been the overuse of CGI, and while there was a lot more miniatures and model work than a lot of people realize there is also a ton of CGI. That CGI has not aged well in a lot of places, especially in characters like Watto and Jar Jar.Jar Jar almost doesn't deserve the dignity of being mentioned but I will, I don't know what Lucas was thinking when he dreamed this guy up. He's supposed to be the comic relief but he is so painfully unfunny and cringe worthy that he's hard to watch. Thank god he had a greatly reduced role in the following films.The Phantom Menace is an entertaining opening to the Star Wars saga though it is held back from the greatness of the originals with a lackluster and largely inconsequential plot, terrible dialogue and generally wooden performances for the most part.",6,0,2,19 September 2015
Zodiac," Zodiac (2007) - Review
","Zodiac is the true story of a real serial killer of the same name who operated in California in the late 60's and early 70's. Damn, this film is great, should know better than to expect anything less from David Fincher, the man has brought us other instant classics like Se7en, Fight Club, Gone Girl and The Social Network to name a few, he is a master filmmaker and this is some of his best work.The story of these 3 men, coming together to try solve this thing and the effects that the pursuit of this goal has on each of their lives is really compelling to watch. The killer himself is portrayed in a rather terrifying way, you never know when he is going to pop up, Fincher really is a master of suspense. This is a long movie but it never feels that way, we really get into all the characters and the film is riveting from start to finish.The performances are phenomenal all the way around, Gyllenhaal is more well known these days but this film shows that he has always been a very talented actor and he is just now finally getting the recognition that he deserves.Robert Downey Jr is here, this is the year before the first Iron Man came out and this film could be considered the official start of his comeback and man, he is awesome in it. You can really see the toll everything is taking on him as the story progresses.Mark Ruffalo is top notch and gives one of the best performances of his career, he really sells the desperation he is feeling about wanting to catch this guy for so long.I would say that it's probably best not to know the details of the real story before watching the film but that is tough one to recommend too for other reasons, I will say that I knew the details of the case and I didn't affect my enjoyment of the film.Absolutely brilliant piece of work by Fincher, suspenseful and loaded with excellent performances, highly recommend it.",Null,0,0,19 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) - Review
","So, we arrive at Attack of the Clones, the worst named film in the whole saga but there is hope, surely George Lucas leaned from all the mistakes he made with The Phantom Menace, right?Well, not really, he did however listen to the fans when it came to Jar Jar, he is largely absent from the film and I also love that it was him who can be directly blamed for putting more power into Palpatine's hands. No, this film makes a lot of the same mistakes as The Phantom Menace made and it also makes whole new ones. Back is the terrible dialogue, wooden acting and even more CGI, though this time it has aged a little better. They are joined by the truly terrible performance of Hayden Christensen as Anakin, the worst love story in the history of film and the unnecessary ruining of Boba Fett, let's get into it.We all know that Lucas likes to cast unknowns and this is usually a good idea as you only see the character but for the love of god, cast unknowns who can actually act. Hayden's performance is so bad, there is no subtlety to him at all, he's always shouting and my god, I'll talk about his creepy romantic face a little later. The only moment that he is good in is his scene with his mother as she is dying and his subsequent murdering of the Tusken Raiders, this is a truly great moment that still gives me chills a little. It's ruined a little though by the scene after it where he tells Padm√© all about it and his acting goes back to its usual standard. Lets talk about that love story, this is truly terrible, first we have the fact that Anakin has been obsessively thinking about her for the last 10 years and when they do finally meet up again he's a complete creep. It's even implied early on that he was spying on her in her bedroom on the security cameras. Once they get off to their romantic retreat on Naboo things only get worse, Lucas seems to think that the primary ingredient to falling in love is just beautiful surroundings, which admittedly they are. The big issue though is the complete lack of chemistry between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman and the fact that every word they have to speak to each other is terribly written. Another thing, the love theme that John Williams composed for these two is absolutely beautiful, its a shame its wasted on them.Another thing I feel is a big issue is that while these two are off on this romantic interlude Anakin is separate from Obi-Wan. They spend most of the film apart and when they are together they are bickering and moaning at each other. The film and the trilogy as a whole would have been better served by building up their relationship more and showing some camaraderie between them.Anyway, what's Obi-Wan up to when all this garbage is happening. He's on his own little detective side quest that's actually really entertaining. He winds up on the planet Kamino where a mysterious clone army has been made without anyone knowing about it. This all seems highly suspicious but everyone just goes with it and doesn't question it, stellar writing George. We meet Jango Fett and much like C-3PO's link to Anakin this is George making the universe smaller again and ruining the mystique of Boba Fett in the process, it does lead to a pretty sweet fight between Obi-Wan and Jango though.Speaking of C-3PO, he makes a return and takes Jar Jar's place as the comic relief that is completely unfunny, the scenes of his head attached to a battle droid's body are painful to watch.While all this is going on we are hearing about this Count Dooku but never seeing him, in fact he doesn't show up until over halfway though, which is a little odd but when he does he is pretty cool. Christopher Lee is a class act and has a great screen presence, all this leads to the best part of the film and its primary saving grace.A massive battle happens and we get to see the Jedi in action as a group for the first time ever and it's spectacular, it's a long final act that has heaps going on. It's probably the best ground battle in the whole saga, there is a particularly awesome shot of a ship falling from the sky and kicking up a huge dust cloud. We see the view from inside the cloud of droids and clones shooting at each other and it is visually very impressive.Of course it wouldn't be Star Wars without a duel at the end, we get Anakin and Obi-Wan fighting Dooku and its a bit lackluster and over very quickly but that's because they were just the warm up act. Yoda shows up and a pretty cool fight ensues, I never had an issue with Yoda fighting with a lightsaber like some have but I'm not a huge fan of the way he screams as he's jumping around.We also get a couple of scenes between Anakin and Palpatine and we see that Palpatine is grooming him and has become a sort of mentor to him, this is great, Palpatine's manipulations are even more entertaining to watch here, we see that he is playing both sides in the war to his own ends and it sets up the final film of the trilogy well.There ends Attack of the Clones, the clone wars have begun and Anakin has taken his first steps towards the dark side.It may have sounded like I was tearing this film to shreds but I actually prefer it to The Phantom Menace, I think, the end action is really awesome.",Null,0,3,19 September 2015
Everest," Everest (2015) - Review
","Everest tells the story of Kiwi mountaineer and guide Rob Hall and the terrible events that happened in 1996 while a large group was attempting to reach the summit of Mt. Everest. Being a true story you can usual expect bad things to happen and this is true, this film is brutal to watch at times, it's also very good. Director Baltasar Korm√°kur is probably best known lately for the 2013 film 2 Guns, staring Mark Wahlberg and Denzel Washington and while I quite enjoyed that film this is much better. I went into this film not knowing the details of the actual event it was based on and if you are the same I advise you to not look it up before you see the film.Before I knew this was based on a true story I had seen some trailers and thought that this was gonna be your typical stuck on a mountain disaster movie, it's really not at all. The film takes plenty of time to set up both the characters and the situation. It's actually quite educational, goes into great detail about how one goes about climbing the highest mountain in the world but it's never boring as it does this, it also does a solid job of making you never want to attempt this yourself.For really the first hour of the film we get to know all the main characters and we are with them as the go through their training. That training involved going up Everest and acclimatizing at a camp and then back down, the next time you go to the next camp up and so on until you have worked your way up to the summit. Some really bad weather happens and it hits the fan, that's all I'll say on that.This film really has a great cast, Jason Clarke plays Rob Hall and unfortunately he was one of my primary issues with the film, I like him fine but I really don't like him as a leading man, he did alright but I think someone else could have been better in the role. I found myself latching on to Josh Brolin the most, I felt that he gave the best performance in the film, really liked him. Sam Worthington was really good even though his role was fairly limited, Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic as always and Keira Knightly gave a really strong performance even if her accent was a bit dodgy in places.The film looked fantastic, the cinematography was beautiful and there were a lot of moments where you will feel very cold just watching it. Unfortunately there were some moments that had some pretty obvious green screen and some bits that really looked like they were on a set, these were minor annoyances but they pulled me out of the film a little.Really well done telling of Rob Hall's story, great performances over all except for Jason Clarke and some minor visual issues, still highly recommend checking this out, preferably on IMAX.",8,0,1,17 September 2015
Sicario," Sicario (2015) - Review
","Well, this is my favourite film of the year so far.I loved this movie, more than that, I think Denis Villeneuve is becoming one of my favourite directors. I absolutely loved Prisoners and while Enemy was a bit too crazy for me it was still a masterfully made and very unique film. This film is maybe slightly below Prisoners in terms of quality but only very slightly.Emily Blunt is really proving herself to be very versatile these days, she was awesome in Edge of Tomorrow but she plays a different kind of badass here. She's the idealistic one, pulled into some really dirty stuff and the she gives the best performance of her career so far. Both Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Torro play great characters, you are never sure where you stand with them, you're never sure what they are going to do next which creates a great sense of unease a lot of the time.Speaking of unease, I feel like the highest compliment I can give a film is that it makes you feel something, be it sadness, happiness or in this case, extreme anxiousness. Villeneuve has some extreme skill at building tension, he did this in Prisoners too. There are some scenes in this that had me almost feeling sick I was so nervous, he drags these scenes out for just the right amount of time to build the tension and they never get boring.The plot, while maybe slightly familiar was really good, it kept me guessing and while this is by no means an action film, when action was utilized it was really well done. Both the way the action was filmed and the sound design gave it a really gritty and intense feel, loved it.Another masterful effort from one of the best filmmakers around today and my favourite film of the year so far, highly recommended.",10,3,8,17 September 2015
