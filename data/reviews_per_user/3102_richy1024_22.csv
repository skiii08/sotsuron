Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sensational Sherlock!
","Sherlock Holmes' intellect and kudos appears to be challenged, from his judgement, to an extraordinary degree. Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) disturbs Watson's (Jude Law) Brighton honeymoon by venturing around the gates of France, Germany and the Alps in Switzerland in an investigation behind the mastermind and equally academic Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). His remarkable sense of empathy and wit prove indispensable in this impressive sequel due to Moriaty's sadistic and charismatic volume. In this ravishing sequel, Holmes undertakes the hero role beyond any extremes of the first movie of the Guy Ritchie franchise.The complex plot and swift nature of moving through discovery and intelligence is balance astonishingly well due to Guy Ritchie's camera and technological advancements and his visualisation for the scene. The music is delicate and remedies with the situation with such beautiful tone and timing. This replicates Holmes' movement and motive as he attempts to form an understanding of the motivation behind his arch rival's menacing path. There is a wonderful scene that depicts the whole scenario that the film plots out for us, the Chess game. Here, ideology demonstrates themes of death, fate and the suspense of making the correct decision whilst attempting to countermand your opponents every thought of conquering the world.Despite the element of mystery that the Sherlock Holmes franchise has possessed, so far Guy Ritchie has introduced a vast amount of intense action which works notably in comparison to the rest of the narrative. Not only does it reveal an additional coating to Holmes' manner, but, it modernises a series that critically needed freshness in a fashionable sense if the Sherlock Holmes brand was to continue to exist and platform itself in the modern arena that Hollywood imposes. The third instalment unquestionably has a mass of expectation to topple this second chapter.",8,0,0,7 October 2012
Skyfall," A skin tight suit will never stop this 007 from killing with his bare hands. The nation's favourite sign is reborn.
","From a parachute assignment with her majesty the Queen over Danny Boyle's inspiring set at the opening ceremony of London 2012 to the misty depth's of the Scottish highlands, Mr Bond faces his most injurious test by having to decide between the two most significant women in his life, thus providing us with a glimpse of who the true Bond girl is.The consensus of Skyfall's Bond has seen 007's maturities establish with a distinctive rawness. We now have a rigid skinned agent whose experiences have seen sorrow and anguish in his past but seen a persona who has benefited from the audience's acceptance of the solemn tenor and less extravagant gadget themes throughout the franchise's fifty year stint. Daniel Craig has provided a new dimension to Bond, predominantly fitting within the criteria of the modern shift of seriousness within film. His wonderful talents pursue the conventional raw emotions that Bond feels in this outing. He crucially understands the material from 007's past and motions of the present determine the character's motivation. The 23rd instalment brings the modern Bond to his most atmospheric challenge yet. Skyfall sees Craig embark on one of icon's most testing missions. His loyalty to M (Judi Dench) is placed under detrimental restraint. Not only does he have to scuffle with a silky but uncomfortable nemesis in former MI6 employee Silva (Javier Bardem), Craig is set the challenge of performing even more charismatically on the eve of Bond's fiftieth anniversary, turning a domestic threat into a personal one.This episode breathes an air of familiarity as we are invited into the notion of a qualified agent, suffering from an ageing atonement with an element of vulnerability and victimisation but his wise and highly articulate prowess in his field play dividend, sticking to his prehistoric loyalty to MI6. The mortal human factor is a blessing to see and but Craig's posture on screen counters this with beautiful arrogance and the mental determination of Bond. A titanic sum of thought has gone into this outing. The franchise seemed to be in a perilous state and needed to be reborn.We are led to believe the perilous trip that Bond has journeyed since the days of Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan has led to this very moment. We develop a perceptive of Bond's continuation away from subsistence of spy life, learning of his life without parents and being invited into his personal routes before M's motherhood role took shape. This series seems to build relationships between each of the films since Casino Royale. On screen growth between Craig and Dench would propose a step-parent affiliation. Certain tags are given through the dialogue and symbolism in character gesture and movement. Besides M, Craig develops a healthy relationship with the very woman who places a rifle bullet through his canvas which rather convincingly reminds us of the characteristics between Bond and Miss Moneypenny.Beyond the tone of severity we are taken on a voyage to relive some wonderful tones and mimics that remind us of the majestic overtones over the last fifty years, particularly in the Brosnan era. Preambles such as an academic censored handgun are imputed whilst annotations on exploding ballpoints are snorted at, in particular by the striking, and resourceful Q (Ben Whishaw). The selection of artiste for Q is rather smart, using a moderately nameless and inexpert big screen actor to play an archaic character, following the footsteps of John Cleese, Whishaw adds much sophistication to the role.Sam Mendes' first attempt at a Bond is undeniably an endeavour he can be proud of. He has deliberated the story with a glorious attitude and tendency, blessing us with some gripping contrasts in China to elevate the superiority in design and technology, and then stripping back the intensity with raw sentiments across the landscape views throughout the Scottish highlands and the country's vast dissimilarities in culture from London. The sombre graphic of the narrative offers complexity and heavy watching is sometimes required but this is not too punishing on its audience after Mendes hurls Bond into a moving train cart and then allows him to briefly pause to adjust his shirt cuff, a gesture that relieves impetus in the scene without entirely concluding the anxiety. Aside from the rich style and glamour of China and London, 007 gets gritty in the swarming markets of Turkey, a replicate of his past lethally reminding us of From Russia With Love. Globe hiking has forever been as crucial to the franchise as the harmonious gadgets, with an elegant ray of the map across all of its geographical coordinates, sizable body counts, sports cars and crafty arsenal are expected within the genre, there have been a few blunders down the years and a couple of forgotten suit bearers. Mendes and Craig work magnificently in creating the epic that Bond enthusiasts have been longing for.",9,16,31,23 December 2012
The Hunger Games," Picturesque scenery and wavering melodies, overshadowed by the brute unethical but the cult of survival.
","Once again the news of an up-and-coming novel series hits the paperback mantelpiece, news of a cinema expedition earths the media with a flourish of brand new protagonists who have intermittently had recognisable roles in many of their films but never had the ruptured their stance in the big time. Jennifer Lawrence (X-Men: First Class) participates as Katniss Everdeen, a mentally cool sixteen year old heroine who volunteers in place of her younger sister to take part in a periodic competition of survival and wit called The Hunger Games, a game of anonymous youngsters killing each other until they are whittled down to a champion. Selection is highly documented, the process is simple and unsystematic, one boy and one girl brawling in an unprecedented, just to make money and provide entertainment for the voracious masses. This journeying rampage has been seen in Japan with Battle Royale, and the nauseating fierce interpretation of the contest in The Condemned starring ex-wrestler Steve Austin alongside Vinnie Jones. Beyond this, games of survival have been part of the ethos of life since the ancient Roman and Greek sports. Survival sports have been overwhelmed with a new design, new combating technique and warfare, establishing itself upon the terrace with such mêlée films as Gladiator.Collins' novel poses a ravishing and penetrating energy; it's a stirring fantasy with copious abundance of themes, with innumerable avenues to explore character development and situational circumstances. Katniss is a character of riding emotions. She comprehends with the intricate notions of the game, the impending sincerity of death but also accompanies an astonishing warrior psyche, believing in the decisions she makes and the philosophy of survival techniques. The earthly feel of Katniss' hiding in the trees whilst she plots her safety or her next move really provide the story with a eccentric feel of the location. The futuristic tones of Collins's writings offer an alternative diversion to the aggression, providing us with an eccentric fairytale feel to it with an enchanting soundtrack.For once there are no sexual implications surrounding a female persona on the big screen. Instead we revel with the composite temperament of the mind as the violence has been stripped back from the novels; readers may find themselves a modestly disenchanted. A full catalogue of pointers such as cynicism have been toned down by themes of lighter tenor of selfishness, defiance and imprudent teenage pronouncements. There is a distinct thesis of the division of class. In District 12, Katniss' home village scour for food, clothe themselves in grey overalls, whereas the brightness of colour surrounding the mighty rich encompasses the differentiation between each district.The leisurely pace of the tale allows us to appreciate character growth, effectively giving us the opportunity to understand the notions of the trilogy. Not only do we feel the emotion of Katniss we instantly feel attached to Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson) devotion and affection for his counterpart despite the two barely crossing each other's paths in the village. Hutcherson bright performance really tells the tale of Peeta's frail characteristics exploring his nervous qualities but knowingly suggesting he possesses great loyalty and honour to the sword. There is more than an inch of primal impact on the audience as the mystery of the battle increases the eventual showdown by using striking cinematography and resisting the push to provide the audience with an action packed beginning. The build up of tension is quite electrifying, giving a reflection of the various moods that encompass the temperament of the lead up to the ultimate clash. Truly encapsulating.",8,3,9,3 October 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A smart insight into the middle-aged man.
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is a poise between perfect love and the perfect heartache. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's movie is toned with a blessing of an appealing cast and a catalogue of emotions, accompanied by a sentimental description. The narrative is smart, counteracted by the bizarre irrational, dealing with love cheats, the self-pitying and the young and the wild. Steve Carell's role exploits the confusion of the male bearing. His wife Emily (Julianne Moore) declares her unfaithfulness due to her exasperated feelings of their long serving marriage. Cal (Carell) moves out in an attempt to clear the air, or in his case languish in his broodiness, wandering how his perfect suburban marriage crushed before his very eyes. Whilst in this fragile, yet sympathetic frame of mind he takes the time visiting a lustrous modern bar where he meets lady's man Jacob (Ryan Gosling). Jacob is a people watcher, a male spectator, inviting his services to help a man revitalise his sense of masculinity in an attempt to whisk the ladies off their feet and prize a night under the covers. Cal represents the typical middle-aged male stereotype, a lack of fashion sense, appalling hairstyle and a list of terrible handbook jokes. With Jacob's tuition Cal sets out on an operation to tangle with as many women as possible in a stab back at his unlawful and dishonest wife.The film's ending cunningly weaves all our lead characters together in an unexpected round up of commotion and revealing confessions. Although we are familiar with Carell's usual role as the family sweetheart or the exile trying to bind his way into the mainstream, his usual temperament is recognised with mischievous tones that we adore him for.",7,2,3,7 October 2012
Ted," Show your kids this and they'll never want a fluffy toy again!
","When the initial news of Seth MacFarlane's Ted circulated it unquestionably turned people's heads. A fluffy, cuddly and heart warming harmless bear became centre stage. A boy's Christmas present becomes his life-long wish, to speak, to move and enjoy human life with him as he struggles to fit within human society. On that note it wouldn't be recommended to compare this with former living toy spirits such a Pixar's Toy Story, far from it as Team Woody and Buzz, unless off-set, pose smoking weed and mouthing off like an animal. The question that's poses is whether Ted is a majestic creation. Would the jokes be considered droll and tolerant if a soft toy wasn't in the picture? MacFarlane has brought the unusual to our screens by being imaginative, expanding beyond his marathon of Family Guy episodes and turning Ted into a triumphant persona when considered the topic of dialogue amongst those who have become intrigued by the comic of a talking, homophobic, self indulgent teddy bear. Counteracting this, Ted is not an original act; we've seen puppeteers and all spent time in reverie of waking up to a cuddly friend. As would be expected, if this was reality the bear would become famous, but after a while the bear becomes ancient history and left to mound up with those folks forced to convert to everyday life, parallel to his opposite number performed by Mark Wahlberg. I doubt this will be one of Wahlberg's most honoured and remembered lead acts in front of the camera as the teddy is primarily centre stage. Mila Kunis is plainly staged for prettiness and zilch else. Indubitably she has acting talent but is purely the mechanism for a love story or acceptably becoming a symbol of lust for Ted to gawk whilst being John's (Wahlberg) paramount Thunder Buddy. Ted basically replaces the languid yet significant friend who clings to his middle aged underachieving chum, who is adoringly attached to Mrs attractive. Circumstances become unsettling and John has the thorny decision of choosing between Mr Fluff or the love of his life.The film does boast a number of pure hilarity components, particularly the scene of prostitute excrement and a few interventions with Ted's employer. The enjoyment factor can be notified within this film but will incontrovertibly struggle to pose any bona fide prominence in years to come. MacFarlane's efforts here will become dreary after purchasing the DVD and left mounted in alphabetical order, sandwiched between titles such as Squeamish and Tedious. Let us hope it doesn't turn into a cult faction where exasperating cyclic Family Guy aficionados quote the screenplay phrase for word as they daily perform with the animated television series.",6,2,3,27 September 2012
Horrible Bosses," Do not notify your supervisor you've watched this one!
","Ever reviled your boss that much, to an extent that you actually wanted to be the cause of their death? Hold on; don't put that into practise quite yet, let Horrible Bosses lead by example first. Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), three dejected, gloomy, non-promoted, abused and sexually tormented gentlemen plan the ultimate crime after a drunken discussion and the employment of an execution adviser. Before they know it they are committed to putting their words into practise.Bateman, Day and Sudeikis act together as a splendid trio as they blissfully drift through the film through numerate altercations with the authorities and each other. In particular, Day's formidable sense of humour helps this comedic experience become a continuous hell raiser. Although the film consistently and dangerously flirts with many offensive quarrels that many viewers may criticise director Seth Gordon's film for, the three protagonists strive to make their changes for the better. The material here may not be admirable to the masses due to its loud-mouth approach and disrespectful tone for the disabled, alcoholics and in particular those who work in dentistry, as this profession is usually tailored with a strong and positive sense of care and precision. Therefore, some may suffer to understand why such a film requires implementing such bad behaviour amongst middle-aged characters. But, as the genre of humour often mimics those who take life too seriously, this film offers an escape route for those who believe that they should be noticed for the commitment or difficulties they face during their daily shift.With multiple recognisable characters amongst the casting, the film offers various pointers of interest. The cast choosing is obvious due to the actors and actresses genre preferences, but to counter-balance this, the film offers comfort as we know what to expect from the faces on screen.",7,0,1,7 October 2012
Shutter Island," A weary but gratifying experiment.
","Shutter Island exemplifies Martin Scorsese's wonderful intelligence and illuminations of motion picture art as an performer and now director. The mystery behind the fogginess suggests a bleak elude eeriness with this film, revealing an unexpected yet incredible finale. The camera also adopts feelings of apprehension, giving it a frantic feel and a true crime investigatory mind set. In addition, we see how DiCaprio's acting capabilities have become more convincing and have improved through age since his heroics in Titanic. This is potentially one of Scorsese's most experimental pieces of film making. His delicate perception of how sound and camera movement blend quite beautifully to create significant meanings and tempers, covering the picture with a blanket of vagueness and trepidation.Set in 1954, U.S. Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) embarks on an investigation into the mysterious disappearance of a patient by the name Rachel Solando, who has escaped or been potentially slaughtered at an asylum institute for the criminally insane. As Teddy tip-toes around the derelict Island he discovers more than he would have wished for, including a few home truths that reveal themes of true identity and false recognition of the enemy. Teddy's character recognition and re-acknowledgment of haunting images from his time serving during the Second World War, with visionaries of his army unit releasing free a Nazi concentration camp and the death of his wife and two children truly capture the emotion that Scorsese, Kalogridis and Lehane attempt to reveal to the narratives admirers. He begins to have reservations with his own memory, his wife and even his personal wisdom due the experience of radical experiments put in order by the mental institute, causing confusion and a host of suspects. As Terry and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) find themselves marooned on the island, Teddy begins interrogating the internees, finding a haunting and unexpected hidden secret relating to Shutter Island.DiCaprio's notions of confusion, conspiracy and misplaced sense of direction really give his character an incredible unbalanced movement, especially considering when detectives are supposed to steer from paranoia. Although his temperament is full of perplexity, Teddy fails to realise he has become the mechanism of a psychological experiment. This truly illustrates DiCaprio's maturity as a performer, feeding upon Scorsese's filming intelligence, congratulating the late 1960s psychological terror era on influence on tails such as this.",9,0,3,7 October 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Wonderful depiction of the average, boring, middle-aged man but also a virgin! Very innocent indeed.
","Judd Apatow's and Steve Carell's characterisation of a 40 year old man replicates how young adults would brand their old man. Dull, immobile and petulant whilst posing in woolly jerseys. Personifying him as a virgin appends another mode of description. Most would find this amusing as generally most of nation lose their virginity from the day they are legal to drop their pants to fool around. Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a charming gentleman but a typical outcast, surrounded by sexual characteristics and hiding a very personal secret. After identifying the bags of sands as metaphor for the chest of a woman, there are those who become apprehensive of his lack of sexual activity. Co-worker David (Paul Rudd) sets out to assist Andy conquer the female anatomy, educating the casualness of intercourse and how to win the hearts of a woman's fine assets.Carell's stage presence has been a pitch of bits and pieces, cameos in Bewitched and the ever-popular journalism comedy Anchorman, starring Will Farrell and Carell's co-forty year old partner Rudd. This could be Carell's big break; this is a startling and valiant effort. He typifies the stereotypical mid-40's male, minus the squabbling teenagers with a vast style and potential to rise as a lead act in future outings that look almost guaranteed on the comedy front. His knowledge of this character is quite remarkable. Although he is of a similar age, to strip back to convey the formulaic maths teacher image is rather amusing in its own qualities. His tone and pitch are on point with no over-expressive weedy exaggerations. This is a character of wonderful intimacy, nurturing his action figure to a polished effect. In contrast, Steve Carell unravels some sheer talents in the comedy locker, unleashing uproarious waves of characteristic sound-effects and squeals to keep up with the tempo of the true nature of the 'giggle'. The delightfully funny nature of the waxing scene not only typifies Carell's wonderful immaturity, but also pictures the orthodox belief of how all men would react to such a meticulous circumstance.",7,1,2,3 October 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Maguire move over... Here comes Garfield!
","When the publication of rebooting the Spider-man franchise from scratch instead of progressing on with the Toby Maguire/Sam Raimi trilogy, there was a distinctive scepticism surrounding Sony's announcement. Considering the first of Raimi's Spidey outings only hit the screen a decade ago, some documented Mark Webb's -take on the Marvel phenomenon as being too premature.Arguably every Spider-man fan, artist and costume owner would compare Andrew Garfield's character in relation to Toby Maguire's disposition. Garfield is much more compelling; intriguing to watch and his physic characteristically reminds us of the Peter Parker in the original comic. He carries himself with a professional tone, knowing how to express emotion and anger in a believable manner, unlike Maguire's freaky Gothic outtakes and inarticulate voice tone. Garfield's twenty eight years of maturity celebrates his ability to act like a teenager but with a distinct level of ripeness, helping Mr Parker become an attractive persona beyond the red mask.The story at times seems a slightly hurried, especially during Peter Parker's transformation from geek to freak in an outfit. But this is fascinating and very articulate on the director's behalf. Even those beyond the audience are conscious of Parker's difficulty to fit in, how he foolishly becomes victim to one of Oscorp's radioactive spiders and so on, yet Webb changes the shade of our hero to a remarkable effect. Rather then studying his new spidey techniques, Webb's adaptation introduces Parker's sudden change with a hint of laughter, causing collisions and confrontation by mistake, overly sticking himself to things and being a little over-aggressive without intending to do so. The element of surprise here keeps the interest with Garfield's volatile persona.The sequel to Webb's refreshed wall hiker could be enormous in comparison to Raimi's filming. Webb has the delight of deconstructing Raimi's trilogy and pick-pocketing every blunder, potentially turning it into a polished and expansive trilogy that may be difficult to emulate if Spider-man is to continue at the movies in future.",7,2,4,27 September 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Another day another Mission too far?
","As the franchise has previously portrayed, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) embarks on a fanatical trail around the world in an attempt to salvage the planet from war intent or total terrorism. Although producer Cruise has succeeded upon his previous effort with Cameron Diaz, one cannot help to think that the Top Gun Maverick is running out of formidable roles to play. Playing it safe despite performing his own original stunts. Ghost Protocol achieves spectacular visualisation but the narrative suffers at a dispense of this. Although MI4 glamorises the beautiful nature of Budapest, Moscow, Mumbai and the heavyweight Burj Dubai, in correspondence to the efforts of the previous two outings for Ethan Hunt this 'mission' achieves supplementary recognition. Impressive gadgetry and high flying action sequences do relieve Bird's first non-animation outing of total embarrassment as it achieves an average viewing.Simon Pegg's position as the technology nerd degrades the roles played by Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton, for who have bright career prospects, suggesting that Pegg doesn't fit the bill of being a recruit of the government within the secret service field. His performance consists of dry humour, possessing an overrated tone that distinguishes all motive of seriousness despite the film's cheesy overtones.MI4 implements regular inductions of the twisting and turning techniques, keeping you engaged within the plot, diverting itself away from any potential deviances that may complicate the narrative whilst you're completely indulged by the re occurrence of Tom Cruise leaping from brick to brick. In comparison to Ethan Hunt's counterpart, Mr Bond, Hunt possesses a vulnerable tone which elevates the film to a new level. His team also band together their feelings; in particular William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) of who possesses a dark secret that has been bullish on his personally but ironically connects him to the central character. Hunt's nemesis Hendricks delivers an adequate act in contrast to Philip Seymour Hoffman's threat in MI3, perhaps of no fault of his own as the camera scarcely captures Michael Nyqvist characteristics as the rival protagonist.Overall, despite MI4's triumphant first few weeks since its release, Tom Cruise's new blockbuster lacks multiple components to be remembered as one of the greatest foundations of the Spy-hero genre. Although Bird's effort possesses and encapsulates the characteristics of the genre and employs a relatively reliable cast, it somehow reminds us of one of those releases when placed onto the market on DVD format it perches itself on the shelf with moviegoers having difficulty contemplating whether or not it is an essential buy to add to their ultimate film collection.",4,2,5,7 October 2012
2012," Exploding tower blocks and flash limousines? Is that all Emmerich's has to offer in his portrayal of the legendary myth of the globes demolition?
","Roland Emmerich brings the eminent conspiracy of global calamity in the year 2012 to life, providing us with a over-elaborate solution, saving only the rich and our protagonists. Considering Emmerich is the predominant for the disaster movie by an international freezing onslaught in The Day After Tomorrow (2004), placing a colossal lizard in the city with Godzilla (1998) and the extraterrestrial incursion of Independence Day (1996). Astray from his catastrophe movies, as Emmerich unquestionably finds contentment by inflicting deadly causes onto the realm of the planet; we have seen appalling exertions such as 10,000 BC that have deservedly injured the filmmakers' reputation. His career has been structured by the reliability of CGI and supervised editing by the ignition of buildings and the collapse of mountains.This addition plays no significance. It's over exuberant and carelessly predictable. Although Emmerich's favoured genre has been ever existent since the birth of cinema, Independence Day (1996) indisputably became a revelation to audiences as it is accepted that every household clutches onto a copy of Will Smith's big break in their DVD collection. Alas, additions such as The Day After Tomorrow and 2012, whilst aesthetically sound, lack efficiency therefore creating unavoidability for conventional ennui. Therefore, it seems Roland has lost his touch, although his enthusiasm to encapsulate the viewer continues to be at the vanguard of his creations. Here, the prime issue relates to the scenery itself and how it seems to look impractical. Some of Emmerich's preferences seem a little uncalculated, persuading us at first that the splendour of CGI is of unreal proportion, but on second viewing certain blips steer this effort towards generic filmmaking, thus the audience lacking in fervour for the heed of the picture. These glitches range from improbable escape routes for limousines and outbound flights escaping the fall of the ground into the earth's crust.Largely, although 2012 carries a heap of stimulation, deplorably after a while its impact is rather molecular, although significant to the allegory tale surrounding the year 2012 it fails to consequently demoralise our emotions. Prepare for a few huffs and puffs as you will become rather fatigued whilst chasing our leads in their hunt for survival.",4,0,4,21 October 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Ravishing Renner runs the show, but does he do too much running? Wander what Matt Damon would think?
","Ten years on from Jason Bourne's lucrative appearance on the big screen starring Matt Damon, the biological experiment's 'legacy' lives on through the pursuit of Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner). Renner spends his time chasing multiple colours of pills for revival and survival whilst effectively being hunted by the organisation that implanted his enhancements into him. Although Renner has become a convincing protagonist since his major onset in Hurt Locker, regrettably the Bourne franchise will not be acquainted from the actions of Aaron Cross. The criterion of Bourne has formerly been set. It's a paradigm that audiences therefore only relate to Damon's unique, unparalleled and instrumental trilogy, energising and pulsating us with what is seen as the contender to James Bond (debatably, the ordeal that influenced 007's modification).Tony Gilroy's extension to the original trilogy is impressive, but way off the pace. Gilroy's (a writer on the previous three Damon projects) intelligence of scientific jargon and terminology in the screenplay is quite remarkable, leaving us flabbergasted, having to refer to GCSE science in remembrance of how to use a test-tube. The camera works tirelessly to keep up with the action with an impressive chase sequence in the slums and a heart-stopping shoot-out in a highly secured laboratory. But, unsurprisingly when re-awakening the beast, Renner's character suffers from following in the footsteps of the already acclaimed Bourne. A feat, unquestionably too difficult to emulate. Cross' flashbacks reveal torment and struggle but rarely fulfil those experienced by the original agony felt by Bourne. Bourne had a sense of purpose, to discover and to reveal the darkness behind those who implanted him with a chip in his carcass and crimson palms. Bourne felt pure agony, denial, languishing from post to post; Cross enters a game of cat and mouse with the odd reflection on his past that seems a little less persuasive in conjunction to Damon's finest outings. Although there is some coherence between the original franchise and Gilroy's attempt at following on from the Bourne legacy, the movies' action sequences seem to overemphasise the 21st century's love for fast shoes and blazing bullets instead of concentrating on the foundation that was created by the novel Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum.The film's course runs with smooth adequacy with small bullets of action fulfilling Gilroy's extremely tense motive with this outing. The relationship between Renner and Rachel Weisz is particularly eye catching with plenty of emotion and intelligence, accompanied with complete understanding of each others needs and responsibilities, after a fragment of wobbling never mind. Visually Gilroy's emulation is spot on with high flying activities, but undoubtedly Cross needs to be given purpose if he is to follow in the footsteps of his counterpart.",6,7,12,27 September 2012
Cars 2," Rustiness overhauls the glimmer.
","Instalment two of the lightning quick, ferociously outrageous, family orientated Cars franchise sees Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his compatriot Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) come together again to compete, but on a slightly, only somewhat generously proportioned scale, in a World Grand Prix race. The road to success in this outing concentrates the majority of its filming on Mater. Whilst attempting to support his best buddy racer McQueen we see the productive pick-up truck becoming distracted by a top secret covert mission: international surveillance, hired by Finn McMissile (Michael Caine).With a new adventure on the cards for the lovable duo beyond the South-western desert of Radiator Springs, Mater and McQueen embark on a perilous journey of cooperation, a break-up and an identity crisis. The protagonist role takes a twist with Mater being registered as the hero in place of McQueen. Although McQueen is recognised for his high speed chases around the globe, Mater's role sees the dusty, rusty articulated vehicle bind all the pieces together giving this second addition of the Cars franchise a heart-warming appeal that all the family will draw an ounce of pleasure from. With an incursion of a number of opposing rivals including Francesco Bernoulli, played by John Turturro, this version will certainly tamper with the nerves, but since when hasn't Pixar taken us aboard its roller-coaster of adventure.Pixar never seems to disappoint, providing consistent and successful family entertainment that children will solicit for parents to take them to the movies. Once the credits role they'll be accelerating out of the screen deeming themselves to be a metaphor racer of Lightning McQueen and finally, ultimately requesting for the merchandise products to re-enact the movie. Whether Cars 2 topples the first instalment, Cars, only audiences will determine. It cannot be denied that Pixar is consistent and they'll be more to follow.",6,1,1,7 October 2012
Avatar," Paradise and ecstasy, all through Cameron's imagination.
","James Cameron's virtual creation deserves it formidable success due to our recognition of it. Avatar changed the perception of film, enlightened the use of 3D technology beyond any other film and placed us in a wonderful landscape. It has acquired multiple criticisms, this a considerable amount with regards to the films topical depiction and suffering with a poor narrative. In response, James Cameron's biggest challenge paid off, the narrative was never a key component. Taking the audience to a new world exhumes spectators; we are intrigued by the possibility of the discovery of an alternative to Earth. Although every film employs a critique, Avatar is equally a sign of and an active influence with regards to our existing culture.Cameron's virtual world can be rectified as the interpretation to the limits of technology. There is the possibility of the human race entering such a fundamental experience in the near future with the launch of four dimensional cinema and the vast increase in picture releases in 3D. Maybe Cameron's Avatar's are a preview of the future. This seems a little extreme, but altogether possible with the likelihood of technological expansion. The protagonist, Jake (Sam Worthington), is a deliberate example of the prospect by transferring himself from a disabled fragile body to a secondary being that promises potential and accompanied with a strong nature.Avatar adopts and reinterprets a range of genres and styles. It is incontestably a produce of post-colonialism; it portrays the Na'vi as a non detrimental tribe who are environmentally friendly and dedicated to protection. Meanwhile the military exist as a careless regime, digging for supremacy with the intent of seizing all intelligence with an overwhelming display of events, continuing to disseminate the myth of the unyielding fighter.Also in this film, gender seems to go unnoticed without drawing these from a critical point of view. The protagonist, Jake Sully, although immobilised implements a strong will and is blessed with a mentally tough attitude. He is the only character with the capabilities to negotiate with the Na'vi by building a structure for them to understand his prowess and for him to comprehend with the 'savage' way of living. His love interest is fascinating to say the least and provides us with a mixture of both male and female characteristics. Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) is firm, naïve to fear but loving and loyal to the principle of family. Sigourney Weaver's intelligent biologist personality, Grace, enables us to understand the hypothetical dedication of the military visit to the native paradise. She incorporates an interactive measure to the film by reminding us of the reason behind gaining intelligence. She is the interpretation of Jake's mother or guardian, reminding him of the commitment he must endure due to his incapacity as he frequently loses himself by playfully trotting through the wonderment of the native world. He is portrayed as the avatar of the viewers, guiding them through Pandora as both he and they learn about it. Although, at first, Jake is characterised in this manner, he soon becomes our saviour character, the most competent and capable. The narrative is indicative of most Hollywood films that portray the implementation of a lost sole, by placing him into an unknown world, but developing him, therefore choosing to be one of the Na'vi.The elegance of the Na'vi's wonderful physical and mental connection with nature emotionally ties us to Pandora's cognitive components and landscape. The narrative couldn't support this entirely without the influence of Cameron's fanatical technological thesis. Any story can be imaginable, but arguably without the influence of hi-tech expertise the narrative is extremely predictable even though it possesses some moral and race related themes. We have seen Avatar's narrative countless times elsewhere without the wonderful tones and magical images. James Cameron was able to build a project that has potential to become the highest grossing film of all time. This exemplifies that cultural surroundings have altered as the ideology the environment has developed into becoming mainstream. Avatar illustrates that the perfect world exists only through the influences of mediation. The film relies on this concept to a great deal, often deteriorating the importance of the tale and the audience's recognition of it.",8,4,7,8 October 2012
Jack Reacher," Mister I don't follow the Law? Mister maybe you should just not be so mysterious.
","Christopher McQuarrie revision of Lee Child's fictionalised tale One Shot sees Tom Cruise attempt to incessantly rejuvenate his independence from his private life with a character that narrowly matches our expectations of him. Mister, 'I am not a hero' Jack Reacher (Cruise) is an intangible character with a vague, jerky background. Former martial, no long term residential palace and a solitary vest he washes each evening, Mister Reacher is someone who cannot be found, only he uncovers you. This is a man who fails to live by institutions, derives his own laws, but a little less enigmatic then he could be as once he appears he doesn't seem to depart again as expected by his fellow on-screen chums.Lawyer Helen Rodin, played by the rather stunned looking and unconvincing Rosamund Pike, hires our elusive hero following a merciless sniper massacre on five citizens of Pittsburgh, due to her struggle to verify the purity of a man whose fingerprints and other contingent evidence on top of a request by the accused for the police to contact Reacher.Despite the gravity of the plot, Cruise executes this routine with a slightly healthier approach than the ghastly efforts flanking Cameron Diaz twelve months ago, notwithstanding the customary tripe involving machine gun shells, a few left and right jabs and the humorous sexual symbolism of a man standing no taller than 5 foot 7 inches, not mentioning the anomalous inclusion of a fingerless Werner Herzog. Cruise's competency does shine above the rest, but poor casting and some examples of hopeless dialogue simply categorises McQuarrie's festive treat with a bad taste after two thirds of the reel. The movie does embrace a few instances of generating a brutal atmosphere which on occasion enlighten the insipidness of immeasurable cross-examination scenes and frail attempt at a rather precarious car pursuit. Cruise's career will never be refined despite his continuous self confidence. Name changers such as Top Gun, Vanilla Sky and the first Mission Impossible categorise the ambitious Jack Reacher as yet another collective to fill an empty space on the shelving.",4,3,10,30 December 2012
Les Misérables," Voices of trembling emotion, 24601 times a dozen more.
","Embark on cinemas most gifted with an astonishing take on a theatre vintage classic. Les Miserables breathes lasting sentiment from its audience with its range of vocal capacity, taking us through a narrative of fateful love, desire and passion. Tom Hooper's marvellous employment of toning back, purely allowing his talented cast to project themselves as if they were on the prime theatre stage itself engrosses us with a blessing of raw material that will in itself be intrinsically testing to emulate.Authored by Alain Boubil and composer Claude-Michel Schonberg (with English-language libretto by Herbert Kretzmer) Les Miserables warrants its acclaim as noticeably the most projected stage piece with a mammoth following which has seen fabulous permanence. With the initial English take performed in the capital in 1985, the French revolution story has been executed internationally over 40 countries en masse 20 languages, promoting itself to a entirety of approximately 60 millions spectators. Subsequently, this has assembled a cabinet of Grammy's in their abundance, nominations for best picture at the Golden Globes and the Oscars before its premier release which is indicative of the prowess of the monumental 1862 marvel tale by Victor Hugo. Like the novel, Tom Hooper's adaptation begins in 1815 prior to the Rebellion of the Revolution in 1852. The chronicle boils down to a loving bond with a varying number of interlacing relationships that accurately define the emotion and volume set by the narrative.With Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe winning the protagonist roles, Javert's (Crowe) pursuit on tracking convict and former slave Jean Valjean (Jackman) is harmonised by grandiose routines from Anne Hathaway as Fantine and Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Fantine's daughter Cosette future love. Valjean's freedom from slavery is tormented by Javert who embarks on a journey to keep tabs on the former old lag. Despite Valjean's embracing endeavour to demonstrate his value by constructing his own business, officer Javert consequentially thwarts his detainee following the liberation of dear Cosette (Isabelle Allen and then Amanda Seyfried) from her janitors, The Thenardiers, manoeuvred by the energetic Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter who offer a comedic stir in their exertion to pursue life royally through their worship for robbery and foraging.Les Mis offers a wonderful transition of sentimental measures from subjugation, redemption and emancipation, which replicate the emotion seen on the theatre stage. This is merged with Hooper's change of ability by stripping back rather than being too hands on, allowing Jackman to pursue the struggles of slavery with empathy with a small child he purchases in an effort to respect an oath to former employee, the struggling Frantine. Despite Hathaway's role only lasting a third of Jackman and Crowe's, her performance truly encapsulates her ability, helping us understand the capitulation of a young mother, relieved from her factory vocation and voluntarily surrendering her body to the depressive depths of prostitution.Aside the themes of oppression, salvation and liberation, accompanied by a host of period costumes and tear jerking mantras, we feel a host of religious overtones through the use of lyric and narrative. Spiritual connotations are introduced as Valjean's is in receipt his release papers following his participation in the docking of an enormous ship. He visualises the position of Christ, hoisting a timber post whilst lagging the French flag. This is also visualised upon his escape, trudging over peaks with a walking stick and frayed garments. As his future improves over time, Valjean's commitment to religion is revealed to us with small prayers, pursuing his eyes to the north in vowel to do good.Hooper's preference to shoot the harmonies live as opposed to having the actors lip-sync pre-recorded versions of the songs follows the customary values of the melodic trend since the 1930s. Diamond performances from Hathaway, Redmayne and Daniel Huttlestone (as Gavroche) pilfer the picture, combining the best of the conventional and already established with the finest of the new, as though they were part of the innovative cast. The camera is truly inspiring, capturing passion with indispensable shots, shaping out the backdrop and solely absorbing the endowment of the cast, dwelling into the narrative through the lyrical manifest. It's rather magnetising and moving to see Hathaway and Redmayne giving their all by emotionally draining themselves, complete with ingredients such as quavering jowls and straining tendons. Redmayne has provided himself a great platform with his lengthened limbs to hit striking notes. He sincerely compliments Amanda Seyfried's elderly fashioned wide eyed and guiltless form, igniting true love and appealing to the spectators as an authentic princess of the screen.The grand finale brings great happiness with a message of victory instead of raising the white flag following the death of the majority of the characters. Les Mis offers a message of union, pride and triumph. With every chant, every connection and revolt, Les Mis communicates to us intensely with its industrious and steadfast entertainers' charismatic take on source material that has been repeatedly performed and appreciated by the masses.",9,2,4,3 February 2013
In Time," Keep an eye on the time Timberlake!
","Set in the future outlook, In Time, replaces money as a source of living, authority and prestige with time. Niccol's alternate perspective on life reveals how from your 25th birthday, everything you do, every step you take and every decision you implement takes time, time which results in life or death. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) struggles through life in Dayton, waking up looking at his left forearm knowing that sacrifice or a life of stealing is his only way of staying alive. A drop of fortune, after rescuing a feeble Henry Hamilton, a man of many years who donates his digits to Will after revealing his ennui of immortality takes Salas on a small, expensive excursion to the fortuitous side of the city. Hamilton's death draws the attention of The Timekeepers led by Cillian Murphy, as Raymond Leon, who attempt to blame Will for the bereavement of 105 years of life. After passing through the zones know for being the neighbourhoods of time, Salas finds himself in the elegance of New Greenwich, a place where people walk through life without urgency as they have all the time in the world as Niccol emphasises in an artistic fashion. Here, Will catches the attention of Sylvia (Amanda Seyfried) a doll-like figure, whose father plays a major role in implementing the global time market. After a short confrontation with The Timekeepers at a graceful house revelry, Will grabs the girl and makes a run for it in an attempt to even out the costs, or in this case, time.The purpose of Niccol's stylish alternative outlook on life gives the film urgency, freedom and also lucrative tones of darkness once the truth of greed is revealed as the film's progression moves along quite convincingly. The film employs countless themes as we pass through the neighbourhoods which reflect concerns of class and honour in today's global financial climate. Although Timberlake and Seyfried's impressive growth and transformations on the big screen continues, the film does endure a repetitive nature as expected due to characters trading, stealing, begging and surveying of time and the constant lack of it in most cases. One way of looking at it is to reflect how much the price of a ticket for the cinema is and to determine whether you would trade in your 'time' for the Niccol experience.",6,0,2,7 October 2012
30 Days of Night," Bloody encounter is violent revelation of the Vamp.
","This is a very stylish encounter, film committees have revised the history of the vampire from days of silhouette filming, throughout film noir and constantly reviewing the innovative alterations of the parasite ever since. Adapted from Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith's graphic novel comes perhaps the most enhanced and startling vampires to date. Even surpassing the malicious Frostbiten as possibly the most cruel and ferocious nightmare to date. 30 Days of Night is based on the factual nature of Barrow, Alaska, falling to thirty days of unreserved gloom, but with the visit of a few uninvited fictionalised guests. Although the narrative is as simple as watching meat fall off the bone this service does not offer any smiles. No knife and forks and no table reservations are made whilst this tribe are in town. This is a tale that follows the survival of the fittest, led by Josh Harnett and Melissa George, against the most enhanced bloodsuckers to date, in the wilderness whereby the cold feeling isn't the artic ambiance, its death approaching.These vampires, led by chief vamp Marlow (Danny Huston) can be labelled as heartless, menacing monsters; moreover these creatures lack distinct levels of emotion. Marlow's mob escort themselves with idiosyncratic shrieks, at scintillating speeds. These spongers offer no radiance, they are carcasses with extremely pale skin who stick around like leeches nourishing off every living essence until every last drop has been inebriated dry. It is remarkable, however that these foreign exports choose to haunt the fields of derelict ice sheets where the meat is rare and civilian blood is bitter. Common logic would propose to lope around the streets of boarders beyond the glacial landscape of Alaska and venture into the metropolis. But as the narrative would suggest, a second instalment is likely to be on the cards due to Niles and Templesmith's fictional continuation. One would only imagine these insects to whisk on from the wintry wasteland and vanquishing in city depths for feeble fresh meat.There is a discrete affiliation that the nation has with the vampire, a careless one actually. They are predictable, sometimes temperamental but an addictive creation. They are our departed cousins and instrumental body, demonstrating how life could be if other forms of meat and vegetation were not so widely obtainable in the common market for us to consume. Fans of revulsion and visceral photography will be in their element. The crimson is rich, sending shudders of emotion down your spine. The cinematography is sharp and its presentation is also rather conceivable. Some will uncover Slade's motion picture as unnecessary and lacklustre, but as always it's a virtue of taste. Romantic comedy aficionados will not endure passion from this love bite fest.",6,0,1,3 October 2012
Prometheus," Space fiction or fact? We humans are determined to discover!
","Yet again the augmentation of CGI stretches across our screens in Ridley Scott latest epic. As a modern audience we are continuously rapt by terrific landscapes and motion inputted by this technology but one could argue the story is pulverised by the visual. Here, I find myself slightly situated in the middle. Prometheus was enjoyable, gripping but I sat wandering if or not we have seen it all before. Sci-fi seems to struggle in the limelight when making comparative contrasts between that of those genres peaking at the top of the movie chart, but this film has excited many with its stimulating proposal of the sighting of the beginning of the human race. This may provoke many points of view or beliefs as many are still in denial of how the human race came into existence. The films' formula is rather simple but complex at the same time. There is a mission to space to typically discover but aside the alien attacks and survival tactics of the crew, we are invited to self-performing operations, tearing through abdominal tissue, stapling yourself back together again and having the ability to gallop around for the remainder of the film after consuming some local anaesthetic. We experience the wonders of space in a nutshell.There are a few controversies, such as opinionated beliefs about how humans were created, many implausible behaviours by the crew who have a collective scientific intelligence ratio of zero and close proximity to the aliens we have seen before in the Alien franchise. As a prequel we expect certain similarities, but not an overriding amount that possesses too many parallels, therefore making basically bootlegging the original. There are however, many reasons to enjoy this film besides those highlighted above. Scott has brought exhilaration back to the usual lacklustre Sci-Fi genre, adding the thriller aspect and increasing tension with the feature of revealing a few unexpected panoramas. The cinematography is spectacular and Noomi Reece and Charlize Theron play their roles competently with much sophistication.",6,0,1,27 September 2012
Taken 2," Taken 2 far or just a case of sequel syndrome?
","Following the recapture of his estranged daughter from Albanian mutineers in Paris, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) recalls his lively encounter on the hunt for the radical captors in the French capital, but this time in Istanbul. Mills invites his former wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) in an attempt to gather some family bonding following Lenore's divide from her affluent partner. Mills subsequently becomes the target due to his escapades from emancipating Kim from the productive sex merchants in Paris. Categorically, as the adversaries seek revenge for the death of their sons and brothers, they track the trio, detaining Bryan himself and the rather volatile Lenore. This outing sees Kim's ripeness and maturity flourish, listening to the former C.I.A. practitioner by locating her father, but at the expense of her mother welfare. As Lenore is taken captive, Bryan conducts the ultimate rescue, as seen in part one to bring his family to safety.Although the arrival of Taken's second instalment has been accompanied with plenty of publicity and prospect, audience's before now are fully aware of Bryan's past and his capacity to subjugate the opposition and fittingly becoming the saviour off those who mean dearly to him with narrow assistance from influences above. Therefore, Taken 2 is plainly repetitive, opting to continue in comparable fashion to outings in 2008. We are invited to tireless hand combat skirmishing and multiple handgun confrontations. Mills is a polished armament and the sound effects are utterly deafening, wish ravishing and piercing gunshots. The combat seems pragmatic, with intense unpredictability in movement and the usage of each environment. Mercifully, Taken 2 continues with the trend of original cinematography with a nucleus of suspense and continuation. Regrettably, Neeson's character lacks components of interrogation and carefully intriguing us with his masterful tools as seen in part one. Maggie Grace seems to have snooped counselling from her peers, although her galloping in front of the camera continues, Grace performs with more direction, portraying authority and ownership by making decisions that indubitably construct the beginning of the family's fortuitous flee from separation at the hands of their opponents. Although, one would be propose not to supply her with several hand grenades due to her lack of site awareness, but neither do the community of the Turkish capital as they seem excessively unaware of the impact of the detonations around them.The essence of security and shelter is Taken's most profitable message. As the plot fails to add further direction to the first outing, the film's memorandum provides hope by considerately inserting the importance of family values and the wave of emotion a family in jeopardy suffers throughout countless episodes in its lifetime. While the climax of this outing undergoes a great deal due to its precipitate and sudden finish, it places a new equilibrium for further relatives to stomp and fail at the feet of Neeson's most hard-hitting disposition. The quintessence of family values overshadows Besson's and Megaton's lack of profundity. If you are looking for a parallel story, Besson is quite simply man you require. With poor outings previously this calendar year, one would hope that the anticipated third chapter grants us with more conviction, with a master class of changeability rather than opting for another destination for the Albanian's to capture this tired and capricious family. Although Neeson supplies us with blissful talent and warrants masses of acclaim, leaping around metropolis locations can only continue for a limited time.",6,1,1,14 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A flawless ending to an impeccable trilogy. Gotham will never rise like this again.
","Possibly the most anticipated trilogy ending to date. Christopher Nolan has taken this epic and defined the true darkness of the comic book legend that is Batman. Following the second outing and the lasting emotion surrounding the great Heath Ledger and his wonderful recital as the Joker, the choice of terrorist Bane and the introduction of the luscious Cat-woman would simply laminate Gotham City through the audience's eyes.The legacy of Harvey Dent is ever existent, consistently tagging the guilt on the Bat himself but hesitantly attempting to reveal the truth of Gotham's advocate, turn homicidal, driven by lunacy, indicative of how fine intent and purpose can go catastrophically off beam. Bane revels in destruction, blaming Batman and Gotham for the death of its most lucrative prospect. He is visceral, commanding and built with sheer clout. Batman's disappearance for the past eight years has seen the city peril in uncertainty, leaving it wide open for assault. Bane continuously laments his captivating movement as the people's revolution. Hardy's character is the perfect director of destruction whilst the limping recluse of Bruce Wayne spends his time being cheated of his precious pearled jewels by the slick and sexy Anne Hathaway. Unquestionably, the only choice of actress to fulfil such a role in post-modernist filmmaking. The film shrewdly materialises itself around the two-faced nature of Dent's visage, providing true binary opposition by introducing many levels of pain and guilt followed by the wonderful perceptive attentiveness of whether Batman will come good and save the day. The intricacy of good and evil materialises beautifully throughout the script, paging our emotions of experiencing how true eradication can leave a cities devotees on their knees, counter-acted by the appearance of a dark shadow who eventually comes good and sheds some light on the whole manifestation.Nolan's final Gotham classic can be branded as a mix of the previous two outings, generating understanding of Wayne's unhealthy past and demoralising fight to save his beloved city from the hands of Tom Hardy's apocalypse. We intrinsically revel in deepened drama with various metaphorical demonstrations of power and prestige. Gary Oldman continues to flourish as Commissioner Gordan, leading the belt and training the young John Blake (Joseph Gordan-Levitt) to suitably becoming a future lucrative hero. Nolan never fails to provide us with the ultimate conclusion. He has given us an ending that will intelligently leave theatre goers in astonishment.Gotham's finest form a faction, performing under Batman's beliefs, just like a swarm of bats with one outcome, to leave a message of intent, hiding in the shadows of its contenders but ferociously surrounding its menace, leaving them doomed in anxiety or furthermore decomposed by blistering unity and a final piercing deadly assault.Nolan's finale is superbly coherent with its previous outings, giving us a conclusion of speechless intent. Audiences may never incur filming of this maturity and scale for an incredibly lengthy period. A rise? Absolutely.",9,2,7,27 September 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," J.K's grand finale, Harry's final frontier.
","J.K. Rowling must be a woman of overriding emotions. Beginning by scribbling in those coffee shops paid off into blockbuster magic. Harry Potter's final instalment is a fitting tribute to J.K's beautiful, eccentric imagination, pursuing the world of magic in a tone that replicates every living soul's beliefs of wizardry. The tone of the magic becoming dark and disconcerting was foreseeable as legend has it that there are those who experiment beyond a devilish level. Those desirable Potter fans that have travelled throughout the world of Hogwarts, having been given an illustrated ending full of emotion and power that encourage those devotees to support Harry and his compatriots on their route towards Voldermort's destruction.The characters have matured and materialised as have the actors, becoming older and more professional towards their dedication throughout their prolonged Potter endurance. One can only envisage the depth of sadness of the franchise reaching its climax. We have endured a figurative and wonderful relationship between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. They have characterised the film and developed Rowling's paperback into a picturesque reality as they visualised the potential of the series and knew cinema has never and will never experience cinema again like this. The sheer emotions of the actors during the premier exemplified the devotion and commitment to something that will live with them and characterise them for the rest of their careers. The question is whether the trio can reach the heights of the Harry Potter franchise in future projects.This final adventure encapsulates the nature of the relationship and feud between both Harry and Voldermort. Giving us a deepening explanation of the events that have unfolded in the previous seven outings. Voldermort's determination to siege power and defeat the brave Harry brings the pair closer than we have ever seen, giving us a true picture of how J.K. Rowling has attempted to encompass one of the greatest battles between two individual in cinema history.",8,0,1,7 October 2012
