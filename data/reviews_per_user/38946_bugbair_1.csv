The Blair Witch Project," Hype over Hyper-'realism' unfounded
","The film needed to be more believable. The stylistic conventions of an improvised script did not outweigh the notion that the substance and premise of the film were flimsy. Things like plot points became too hokey and convenience (when only a tinge was need). The point of the in-film documentary was what could the Blair Witch be (good: kind-hearted yokels, bedtime stories, or bad: evil copycats, truly malevolent ectoplasmic miasma, cartoon villains?); but halfway through, that ambiguity was lost. The major flaw of the film was there was no other possible explanation than the one we were lead to believe. Things were too much what they seemed. If only the second half was as 'chilling' as the first half was funny. The ending was nice and memorable but only because you think 'oh yeah, I remember that from earlier'.",4,0,2,3 August 1999
