The Blair Witch Project," The absolute worst movie ever
","I screamed and yelled after watching this film for the waste of money.  This is absolutely the worst film ever made, but probably one of the most brilliant marketing campaigns.  I can't believe all the positive hype it got from all the stupid and easily swayed by the masses people.",1,2,4,31 May 2001
