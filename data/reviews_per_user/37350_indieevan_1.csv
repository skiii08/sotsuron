3:10 to Yuma," Interesting.
","310 to Yuma was a tense, exciting movie consistently harmed throughout by strange continuity and poor logic in action scenes. Like, it was actually incredible how bad the choreography and continuity of scenes was, and it wasn't just something that nitpickers would pick on. It was pathetically bad. people would appear or disaapear where convenient, open shots would be missed, people once holding guns would no longer be holding guns, wounds and injuries appearing and dissapearing where convenient etc.. It was an unprecedented disaster of a lack of awareness from the filmmakers which I have never seen in a high-budget movie before. It's a shame, because everything else about the movie is top notch.",8,0,1,26 July 2019
