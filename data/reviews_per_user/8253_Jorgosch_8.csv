Resident Evil: Afterlife," Seen the trailer, seen it all
","There I was at the theatre and on an impulse decision bought tickets because the film did well at the box office. This is the same kind of impulse that makes you go and buy a hamburger to get quick and short relief, after which you completely forget about it. It's kind of the same with Resident Evil: Afterlife (2D).You get garish effects (sort of like a 'best of' collection from other flics), cardboard characters that are fleshed out so basically that when they turn sideways you can see the stand that supports them, a plot so minimal it doesn't bother to explain why some things occur (where do the petal-mouthed guys come from? who the hell is that hooded giant with the anime weapon?) and the longest drawn-out slo-mo you can get for the money of one ticket.Sure, Milla is always nice to look at and we silently cheer her on as she goes on yet another killing spree but often times I not only had to suspend disbelief (the topic already demanded that) but to actively shut off the brain to enjoy some of the more impossible shenanigans.There is no comic relief in this one, and that's probably because there's no real tension either. Yes, it has the few obligatory jumps but mainly because the scenes are cut so short that when a zombie says 'boo' he's already snagged somebody and disappeared again before you can say 'argh!'.Nope, the movie is too disjointed and characters as much as villains are too weak to care for them or hate them enough. Movie fast-food which goes down smoothly, but is ultimately tasteless. Enjoy your hamburger, but don't complain afterwards when you feel guilty. Again. 6.5/10",6,0,3,16 September 2010
The Hunger Games," Emotional but shallow
","Knowing nothing about the movie or the source material, I'd let myself sway by the high rating to watch this movie. Well, I have nothing negative to say about it except maybe that it was too long, but the over-the-top ratings definitely aren't justified (and are coming down as I am writing). It's definitely a movie aimed at younger people because the content is very emotional, but there is nothing noteworthy about the plot, the actors, camera or soundtrack. Everything is done by the book and the result is effective but predictable and ultimately shallow and clichéd.I want a movie to surprise me, either with its story, or effects or any other cineastic means. None of that happened here, and I even glanced at my watch half-way through... never a good sign.So... hooray for teen angst, but not much for the more mature viewer in there.",6,0,6,3 April 2012
Avengers: Endgame," Not that grand experience I had hoped for
","Avengers: Endgame is not a bad movie at all. It's just not what it's made out to be - supposedly one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, you have seasoned actors who deliver the necessary emotions which are put into scene well enough and several strings from other movies and tv series are tied together. But that alone doesn't make a movie great per se, that's just good planning.The story itself is your basic time travel retcon and there aren't any clever twists that were hidden in Infinity War. 2 out of 3 hours of the movie is characters talking as a fan service, one hour is plot advancement. You get your deus ex machina (Captain Marvel) who tips the balance this time while she was conveniently absent in the last movie. You get Iron Man, who doesn't even have superhuman abilities, performing a feat that should have killed him right away according to the lore.The movie is satisfying yes, but that doesn't make it great. Nothing of what happens is particularly awe inspiring, surprising or new. With all the talking, it rather feels like a double episode that finishes off a tv show.And to be honest, placing this among the greatest movies of all time feels like an insult to the great ones which excel in all possible departments - acting, story, score, cinematogrpahy, blocking etc. But I guess a generation that votes for a president who promises to make America great again can also vote such a movie as one of the greatest. Both aren't.",6,3,4,28 April 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Stunning visuals but story leaves to be desired
","Quote: The Good: In terms of cinematic and visual scope - astounding. The camera sweeps and the battles were awesome. I really felt like I was there. Gollum was probably the best aspect of the whole movie (his inner struggle was nicely done). Gimli's comic relief was nicely done too.The Bad: After watching it, I just kinda sat there going, 'ehh...'. I dunno, the first one has this magical appeal to me (seen it 4 times already) but this one just kinda fell flat. Maybe I set my expectations too high.For one, the musical score failed IMO. I could only discern one new musical track... everything else was either from the first or too ambient (Enya-like female choirs)Character development was nil for the new characters. It was too hard to get any feel for them. It just felt like, 'here's blahblah, son of blahblah' and that was it. Grima appeared to come out of nowhere. The King's son also had barely any development and there was one other guy that I had NO IDEA who he was the whole movie (he was always around the King, helped put his armor on).I could tell that the main focus was the Helm's Deep battle. While that was awesome, the rest just felt kinda shallow and long winded. The first half was especially slow and the last was all fighting w/ no story to back it all up. What was with Gandalf riding in the last scene? Where did he find King Rohan's son? How did Rohan's son's army turn that big??? (in the beginning he said only him and his small legion still fought for Rohan). How did they manage to kill off like the remaining 2,000 or so of Sauraman's troops. Why did that Rohan lady fall in love with Aragorn... they only met for like 2 seconds.All in all it left me awed but a little unsatisfied. 6.8 out of 10",8,1,2,21 December 2002
Drag Me to Hell," Not a revolutionary entry in the horror genre
","First of all, I'm surprised that this movie has been rated so high by the community. If you want to break it down, where's the real achievement of this film? Engaging story? There are no real twists that could not be foreseen by a regular movie goer. Instead, it's an amalgam of stories that have been told before, mainly Ringu and Ghost (yeah, with Patrick Swayze).Special effects? Raimi is almost at the same level that he was with Evil Dead, he's even quoting himself with the séance session. The ghosts in 'Ghost' were the same shadowy figures... seen it all decades ago.Gore factor? Raimi does a big nod to Peter Jackson's Braindead in showing all kinds of yucky body fluids but in Braindead it felt at least humorous whereas in the context of this movie it feels a bit forced.To sum it up, I was thoroughly entertained, but not surprised or overwhelmed. Didn't like the predictable ending either - 6/10.",6,1,4,29 August 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," One hell of a ride
","This is one hell of a picture!I understand from having read other comments that many people were somewhat dissatisfied with the movie. Well, on the special effects almost nobody complained and they are certainly among the very best ever seen on the big screen. I especially like the effects you DIDN'T see... Did you notice how the camera worked during the car chase scene? It went right through other cars in order to follow the main action in a straight line - impossible but ingenious.Now the main complaints obviously were with the story line. Well, people, let me remark that this is not a kid's movie despite it's rating and you need a certain intelligence and background to digest what is thrown at you. And this is what they do, they throw little morsels of information and philosophy at you (or big chunks sometimes, there are at least 2 longer monologues) and leave it up to you to interpret it. Obviously your average american schoolkid with an x-men background will be unable to do so and will feel left out in the open.But for the somewhat broader minded this movie will be a thrill ride, not only because of the awesome action but also because of the mind fodder it gives you. My head is still spinning from weighing the concept of possible realities and greater schemes behind it all. And phrases like 'It's like wiping your ass with silk' sounds like something Oscar Wilde would have said.Yes, the brothers definitely know their classics and their drama theory. Like George Lucas did with the first 3 Star Wars, the 2nd installment of the 3-part-drama is the Action part, after we had the Mystery part.It is pure joy to see how they build up the story line. First, lulling us in security, showing joy and confidence like in the infamous dance scene, demonstrating Neo's super-powers only to plunge us into utter despair at the end and question the whole concept of reality all over again.I fully expected an open end because if you only have to wait 5 months for the next part, what better way to keep us on the edge.And, by the way... has anyone thought that 'The One' might have a double meaning? The religious meaning as in 'saviour' is a human interpretation but that is not how a machine would think. One in a binary sense is also the counterpart of Zero... I'll let you make your own sense of that.The only thing I hope for is that we will get an Extended Director's Cut on DVD that will take more time with dialogues.See you in 5 months!",9,0,0,18 May 2003
Zombieland," Flashy entertainment without a message
","I had some fun watching this movie as it works as a horror comedy, but at the same time lately I feel guilty giving this kind of movie a high rating. There's just nothing new to be added, instead, the same plot elements get further condensed and reduced every time, like a new snapshot of a well-know monument.The thing is that people apply the same rating for different kinds of movies. I gave this one a 7 for good but mindless entertainment, but it can't be helped that it will rank there on the same level as other movies which get a 7 for being cinematic-ally or plot-wise interesting. That's just the way it goes. Comedies that the broad public enjoys as funny are usually not clever at the same time, or would you rate American Pie as a cinematic masterpiece? At least Zombieland also worked on the character level so you could identify with the main characters (yes, that's you, nerd).While I have the impression that the bar is constantly being lowered plot-wise these days and plot is being replaced by violence, grossness or any other kind of exaggeration, I also notice that due to the shorter attention span of the twitter generation the run time of movies gradually gets shorter. This one was over just after 80 mins, the rest was credits (and an outtake). And speaking of exaggeration, I also felt that the Bill Murray cameo was exaggerated, the same has been done before, also with Bill Murray as the supposed center of a film cult.As the philosopher said, every nation gets the president it deserves and the audience gets the movies they deserve... and pay for.",7,0,0,16 November 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Perfect Adventure
","Watching this movie I was absolutely awed by it's impact, the way Star Wars made me feel when I was a teen. And I think this is already one of the movie's biggest achievements: To achieve a level of, well, if not reality, then involvement, to let oneself absolutely fall into it. Stunning special effects, well done writing (absolutely forgivable the deviations from the book for better dramatic effect, like absolute darkness in the spider's lair). In fact, everything is so gorgeous, grand and stunning, that it is even more noticeable when actors don't live up to everything that's going on around them. Even so, there was only one personality that I would have liked to see changed and that is Frodo. Elijah Wood's face for me didn't show enough pain, cruelty or any of the wide range of emotions necessary when not doing the baby smile. Viggo Mortensen certainly looks heroic, although he seemed to move too slow for a ranger in battle and talked too low during the 3 movies be recognized as one with great blood. I would have wished for a more energetic performance to show his finally accepting the role of king, like a more determined walk or whatever.Let me list some things that I saw as goofs, but then again, everything was happening so fast sometimes, I could be wrong :-) The White Wizard always fights with his staff - hm, he is a mage, isn't he? SOME display of battle magic would certainly have been nice... In one scene, a hobbit on a horse slashes the tendons of the hind legs of an oliphant - excuse me, but I just can't believe he would have the armlength... In one shot on Mount Doom, a slope against the sky, we actually see blue sky although everything was supposed to be dark in Mordor... And finally, the two hobbits crouching on a rock in the midst of running lava, well, the rising heat alone would be enough to burn them to cinders and let's not forget about the sulphur smoke :-)If not for these tiny imperfections, the movie could have been a 10, now it will have to make do with a 9 :-)And I feel empty, that now, after 3 years, there is nothing more to look forward to in Middle Earth...",9,0,0,21 December 2003
