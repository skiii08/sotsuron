It," Another remake that should have taken more time to flesh out
","The novel 'It' is so complicated that, eventhough, this is a first installment, it felt forced and missed so many nuances that Stephen King captured in the book. Understandably, converting a novel to film will not have the exact feel, the kids were comical where comedy should not have been point - this kept me from ever gettting in that nervy feeling and expectation of foreboding. It felt like 'Goonies' meets 'Stand By Me'. There were some very good effects that you don't see often in recent horror movies and then there's was rubber body part scenes where you wonder, 'did they even try?' Overall, if you want a Cliff's note of King's 'It' to where you'd earn a solid 'C-' for comprehension, it will suffice if you can't make it through this epic tome. We'll just have to see if the creators figure things out with Part 2 to earn a better score from me.",5,2,5,16 May 2019
