The Avengers," Good Movie
","Like a true Avenger, this movie's greatest strength is also its weakness: its light-hearted and playful tone makes for some fun moments, but they also rob this film of any real depth, emotion or suspense. While Marvel movies are good at being fun to watch with their bright action sequences and lively banter between characters (even during what is supposed to be heated battle), at a certain point it gets old. Throughout the film there is no doubt the Avengers will defeat Ultron, so the interest then lies in how they will defeat him, and the answer is a disappointing 'they simply over power him.' If you enjoy this Marvel series where the villains emerge with no real interesting motive and are beaten at the drop of a hat, then of course this movie is a must see. I'm just holding out hope that Marvel takes more risks in their future films.",9,0,1,9 October 2015
