Kill Bill: Vol. 2," tarantino, where have you gone?
","Admittadly im an avid fan of this director, producer and writer.From Dusk till Dawn was interesting and fun, Resovior Dogs was superb and Pulp Fiction was quite simply a master class.Indeed i throughly enjoyed Kill Bill Vol 1and was looking foward in anticipation to the second helping.however i was bitterly dissapointed with what arrived.Kill Bill Vol 1 set the scene, it was a fantastic visual expierance and a thouroughly enjoyable ride.The absence of your typical Tarantino dialogue was replaced with sublimely clever visuals, the interactions between the main players allowed you to hear witty conversations take place without a word being spoken.Vol 2 has very little, in my opinion, to offer.it was good to see Madsen back and Carridine puts in a good performance by being slimey and irritating every time he appears on screen ('performance'?). Daryl Hannah is excellent as Elle, and the movies one saving grace (the allways outstanding) Uma Thurman, is as ever wonderful. However aside from the cast one has to say 'so what?'. Increased dialogue??they might as well have just shut up because there was very little of interest to say.Tarantino, the worlds most popular self confessed nurd,had his nurdiness turn around and bite him hard on the ass.the first installment was nurdy cool the second, just plain nurdy.Truth sirim?Please.Night of the living dead?its been done.the time hardened professional hitman and one of the worlds greatest killers playin Kindergarden Cop?Please.admittidly the scenes with Gorden Liu are very enjoyable, entertaining and downright funny and it here that Tarantino succeedes most in paying homage to his treasured Kung Fu genre.However this isnt enough to make this movie great, it isnt even enough to make it average.i walked away after viewing it(not during it as i was tempted to do) and had what alcaholics call, a moment of clairity....it was the first time i had watched a totally forgetable Quentin film.A sad day.Lets hope that Vincent and Vic can restore some of my faith in humanity.a forgetable 4 out of ten and not worth the effort.",4,4,8,4 May 2004
