It," I prefer the original IT film to this remake
","I love horror and I loved Stephen King's original IT film. I wanted to really love this movie, but I just wasn't feeling it. I think I watched 75% of it then got bored and never finished. (I'm watching this as a rental, though, so I may finish it tonight). It was a little bit different than the original...they added dialogue for the kids that was more 'current' so they brought up references to sex more...which in my opinion added nothing to the movie. There was more special effects and a bit more gore...I don't think these added anything to the movie either.The clown didn't really scare me. I thought some of the scenes with the clown were just weird and over done. I'm disappointed. I'll give it a 6, though, because it wasn't an awful movie...it just didn't live up to my expectations.",6,3,4,10 March 2018
