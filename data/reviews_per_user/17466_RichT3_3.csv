The Rock," One of the BEST action movies ever made
","This was the first Michael Bay movie I had the privilege of watching on the big screen, and it is still his best (closely following by Armageddon and Pearl Harbour). It has everything you could want from a big-budget action film :- Great story, excellent cast (Sean Connery, Ed Harris, Nic Cage, Michael Bein, David Morse), amazing action sequences, well-integrated comedy moments, and SUPERB direction. The battle scene in the shower-room on Alcatraz is one of the most touching and poignant battle scenes ever filmed, and leaves you close to tears (especially as Mr Harris 'damns' the Government powers responsible for causing the slaughter of the heroic Navy Seal Crack Insertion Team). Two-and-a-quarter hours of pure entertainment and adrenalin !!!",9,5,5,29 November 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," Great film
","One of the best films of its type, only bettered by Frank Darabont's other period prison drama based on a Stephen King story 'The Green Mile'. Mr Darabont and Mr King appear to have hit on the perfect partnership, in making fantastic films based in prisons and set in days gone by. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are both excellent in this movie, although Mr Freeman is always excellent (especially in his high school drama 'Lean on me'). Well done to all concerned in this excellent production, and let's hope that Mr Darabont and Mr King continue in this successful vein for the future",9,1,1,29 November 2001
Braveheart," The GREATEST FILM EVER MADE !!!!!!
","Mel Gibson spent a good few years in getting this film made .... and it was COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED. Mr Gibson has always been one of my favorite actors, but his greatest success by far was in the production and direction of this SUPERB movie. Although the movie itself is almost 3 hours long, it is totally absorbing from beginning to end. I first saw this film as a special preview, and had to take the very last seat in the cinema, which of course was the worst possible one. The film was just so amazing that I didn't move a muscle for the entire film, even though I was sat at a very uncomfortable angle. The 3 hours seemed to fly by, so much so that I was late for an appointment, as I just hadn't realised how long the film was, and I never checked my watch once. Everything about this movie deserves the highest praise indeed, including Mr Gibson's Scottish accent. I have watched this film time and time again, and it never ceases to impress, or indeed move me, as certain scenes seem to provoke a tearful response at every viewing. Well done Mel, I don't believe ANY film will EVER surpass this MASTERPIECE !!!",10,2,4,29 November 2001
