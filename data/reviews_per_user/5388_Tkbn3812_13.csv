The Expendables 2," Improves on the first film; exactly what to expect from an action movie
","The Expendables 2 is a welcome improvement on the first film, which is as decent as an action film can get. It has the foundations of a proper, well-developed plot, with good characterisation of most of the major characters. However it does not properly characterise all the Expendables, leaving several merely ''there'' and nothing else. Still, it does better than the first, which managed to characterise merely protagonists Barney and Lee to a considerable extent. While the film isn't remarkably better than the first, the action is certainly more interesting and entertaining. The final airport scene climaxes very well, and reunites all the characters from throughout the movie, including Chuck Norris' character, who just coincidentally shows up at the perfect time.However, while it manages to capture the protagonists very well, the main antagonist isn't quite as terrifying as in the first movie. Regardless, his character is definitely not likable; his name even resembles ''villain''. Stunts are not particularly remarkable either, in many regards recycling that of the first movie, for example their plane coming in low when shooting. Combat, however, does improve, which can be seen in the airport scene; perhaps the very fact that this scene takes place in the daytime and not the night, like the first film, improves it.Overall, this film is a well-paced action film that is worth a watch. While some may see the plot as just a typical run-of-the-mill action story, the movie itself compensates with good characters and actors, bringing these all together to make a good movie. It may not be perfect, but it is as much as one can expect from an action movie.",8,0,0,3 January 2017
Catch Me If You Can," A brilliant story, with stunning acting, and a gripping plot
","Catch Me If You Can is quite a unique film, one of which is to be commended for the beautiful way it tells a magnificent story. Directed by the great Steven Spielberg, it recounts the true story of Frank Abagnale, one of history's greatest imposters. Spielberg has portrayed a story that has viewers connecting with the characters, with a well-paced narrative that is bound to both impress and shock the audience, alongside spectacular acting, and a simple yet intriguing musical score to couple the most tense scenes.Frank Abagnale is your typical 60s teenager. A 16 year old, he is an only child living with his parents, a simple yet sufficient life.But his whole world is turned upside over the course of a few weeks. When the IRS come after Frank's father for unpaid taxes, the family is forced to move into a small apartment; not much time passes before the two parents separate. This is the turning point for Frank, and sends him on a journey that will go down in history as one of the most remarkable stories of an imposter.So begins a story that spans three years, three jobs, almost $6 million in stolen money, counterfeit checks, not to mention a wedding, and tells the story of both the teen on his crime spree, and the FBI agent who will stop at nothing to catch him. Frank Abagnale is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, with FBI agent Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks. These are two big names of Hollywood that do remarkably well in their individual roles. DiCaprio plays Abagnale in a realistic manner, bringing out the teenager's sly nature, while also taking into account his more human side, of which pushes him out on his journey in the first place. Tom Hanks was an excellent choice as the FBI agent; his acting is convincing, as he portrays the workaholic as a tough, no-nonsense guy who has a troubling backstory and, deep down, a heart.Frank Abagnale Senior, played by Christopher Walken, plays a pivotal role in the plot. It is the financial troubles that Frank Junior sees his father in that in turn encourage him to set out on his journey of three jobs.Amy Adams, who as Brenda Strong plays Abagnale's bride, seems to have been an unusual inclusion. Nothing eventually comes of this proposed marriage, and as convincing an actor as DiCaprio is, it at no point seems as though Abagnale is truly in love. Perhaps this is intentional, however, considering the outcome.There are several minor characters in the film, including Martin Sheen as Brenda's father and Natalie Baye as Frank's French mother. Cheryl Ann is played by Jennifer Ann, in a short and unnecessary scene of which, again, nothing comes out of.It is in fact from the moment that Frank leaves the US that everything begins to fall apart. The scene of which involves his eventual arrest in France sees DiCaprio let down his performance a little, switching from a character who is in control to that of one now distressed. After this, the relationship between Abagnale and his capturer, Hanratty, is built up; for the most part this is successful, however there are some flaws. The scene where Abagnale nearly leaves the country again is not particularly realistic. Clearly Hanratty had enough faith in Abagnale to believe he would not leave, and while this is what happens, surely he would not take the risk?The film features yet another unique and beautiful score from John Williams, who approaches scenes of action with a jazzy motif, of which makes a two minute debut in the opening credits. The actual theme for the movie contrasts this motif, and is a pleasant tune with hemiolas, a trademark Williams-styled theme reminiscent of ET and Jurassic Park in its instrumentation. This score is truly a positive for the film.However, as with all films based on true stories, there are certain aspects that need to be pointed out. There was no planned wedding in Abagnale's real life; while he does eventually marry, this is actually after his release from prison. His parents were never in financial trouble, and in fact Frank's first victim of fraud was his father himself.While Frank did have a relationship with an FBI agent, it was not to the extent seen in the film. He most certainly did not call him every Christmas; the real Frank Abagnale called the prospect of calling the man in charge of capturing him absurd. One thing that isn't stressed enough in the film is the fact that Abagnale committed most of his fraud before the age of 19. There is no way that Abagnale looked 28 (DiCaprio's age at time of filming) when he was only a teenager, and if it were made more clear he was a teen for most of the film the audience may have been even more impressed by his crimes.However the film is right to portray a criminal in a positive light; the real Abagnale has gone on to assist the FBI and other crime agencies in counter-fraud measures, from his experience in the real world. Overall, this is a pleasant watch that will certainly leave a positive impression on viewers. Remarkable acting from DiCaprio and Hanks are the highlights of the film, with a plot that, regardless of inaccuracies, is simple yet interesting. The music score by far is a positive, with in-depth character development that keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.Although the film has flaws specifically in its romance, it wins in almost every other aspect, keeping viewers connected to the story. The film certainly is to be commended in the way it portrays a troubled teenager and the man sent out to stop him. It most definitely succeeds at telling the true story of a real fake.",9,1,2,26 September 2016
Zootopia," A rare gem everyone can enjoy; not quite perfect, but enjoyable
","Zootopia is one of the highest grossing animated films of 2016, and for the right reasons. It has unique characters, a clever plot which explores important themes, and stunning animation. It seems people are not seeing the movie for what it is; something that may not necessarily be suited for young children, with themes that should be portrayed in films for an older audience. Regardless, this is a terrific film that the entire family can enjoy, and deserves praise for this.The film revolves around a young rabbit called Judy, who has from a young age aspired to be a police officer. And, from a young age, she has faced adversity in the form of racial prejudice; well, translated into the animal kingdom. This racial prejudice is the key theme of the film, explored through different species of animals rather than different races.To Judy, living in the country on her parents' farm, Zootopia is a far-off city where ''anyone can be anything''. These dreams are completely dashed away when she is accepted into the Zootopia Police Force. Here, she faces discrimination from all corners, including mainly officers at the police department and her boss Chief Bogo, a mean, apathetic buffalo. This comes from the stereotype (another key theme of the film) that rabbits are ''dumb''.Her dreams are almost shattered when Chief Bogo threatens to fire her (for a silly reason), giving her one chance to solve a missing animal case.Teaming up with Nick, a fox con-artist, the pair begin an adventure that changes Zootopia and its prejudice forever.The movie is to be applauded for the impressive way it explores discrimination. Never before has an animated film so stunningly explored these themes in a way that leaves viewers thinking about its meaning long after watching the movie. How it does this is simple; reiterating through Nick and Judy, both victims of prejudice, the harsh stereotypes that are employed by Zootopians. Through Judy, we are able to empathise with her as her experiences unfold. Through Nick, we are able to see how, bullied at a young age via stereotypical discrimination, his life was shaped.In Zootopia, predators are the minority seen as dangerous. Clearly this fear is just another stereotype that is explored cleverly, attempting to show how fear based on stereotypes is commonly unsubstantiated. The characters are unique in this film too. From Judy's protective parents who early on blatantly state how they are happy because they gave up on their dreams, to the resilient and studious Judy herself, Nick the seemingly sly con-artist who really represents far more, the Chief who is an obvious biased and the assistant mayor who is apparently under-appreciated by the mayor himself, although she ends up representing far more than just that.Zootopia features amazing animation, which truly brings to life the characters. In a movie featuring animals this is a necessity and Zootopia definitely fulfills this criterion.But every movie has its flaws. As great as Zootopia is, there are certain aspects that are underestimated in their influence. For example, the film is clearly scary at times. While not obvious at first, certain scenes featuring the ''savage'' animals have the potential to frighten the younger viewers. This is probably a little paranoid, but remembering that this is a kids movie it is important to note.Even more noticeable is the plot. Sure, an adult could follow it with ease. But children are going to have difficulty understanding what is happening. Certain plot developments will not make sense; more so than other animated films because this is a detective story. Of course, for the most part children do not understand plots regardless of their complexity, and thankfully, while not teeming with it, the film does have humour that will entertain the kids.Prejudice within the film is arguably its best feature. However, at the same time it has its flaws, namely that it is explored rather brutally; the Chief is quite rude to Judy, the Fox bully at the start is mean (''you think you will ever be more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny?''), and Nick's flashback is somewhat graphic. Although these are all eventually resolved, it seems its exploration was harsh.You see, the truth of the matter is that Zootopia is a complex film. It explores themes that usually do not form a part of animated films, through a typical partner-cop detective story, with scenes that may appear in a horror movie filmed as live-action. To the most part it succeeds at exploring prejudice, however its detective story can be confusing at times, and as for the savage scenes, it's clear after a second look that they may appear frightening. Again, perhaps that's paranoid to think, but still.Push this all aside, and Zootopia is a great film. The reason it has been received so well is because it is a film that both kids and adults can thoroughly enjoy, a rarer combination nowadays. It is to be praised for how well it handles prejudicial themes, stereotypes and discrimination, alongside its clever, witty characters that really allow viewers to connect, and quality animation which truly brings the film to life.Zootopia is one of those rare gems that the entire family will be entertained by. Although it does have its flaws, it is definitely up there with the other high rating animated films, both commercially and critically.",7,0,4,12 July 2016
Ready Player One," Spielberg does it again; Great Story, Great Characters, AMAZING visuals!
","Ready Player One is one of those movies you just HAVE to see in cinemas. Seriously, you will honestly regret not seeing it on the big screen when you watch it on your TV or computer at home. It is just such a VISUAL masterpiece!That's not to mention how much fun it is. I mean it, Ready Player One is just such a fun ride with a great story. It's not the most original movie ever made, sure; actually, it's kinda similar to Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. But still, even if for some reason you think this movie isn't that original that doesn't undermine it. Do remember that it's made by Spielberg, one of the BEST directors in history. The story is pretty simple. Wade Watts, known as Parzival in the Virtual Reality platform known as Oasis, is competing against the rest of the world for three keys that will guarantee him or the winner ownership of the entirety of the Oasis. It's a mad dash for those keys, and an endless amount of wealth for whoever makes it there first.This movie actually has a simple yet great, wholesome story and message. As always Spielberg has given us a really fun movie while still giving us a meaningful plot with meaningful characters. It even has some pretty decent twists here and there (just wait till you learn the identity of all of Parzival's friends in the Oasis!). I found a bit of the middle to be a little messy, but that's not too big a deal. And, fine, I think the characters could have been developed just a touch more...but that's forgivable.I've heard one person say this movie looks really cliched...well, I guess maybe it is, but not anymore than any other action movie; they're all predictable to some extent these days. That doesn't change how much fun they are. And, unlike many action movies, this one has a pretty well-crafted story and AMAZING VISUALS.Seriously, as I already said, you will REGRET not watching this in cinemas. It is actually such an amazing movie visually. I honestly spent the entire movie wondering how Spielberg and the crew actually managed to make the movie look so beautiful. How did they film this beast? There's this one huge battle scene in the movie that made me just want to smile, it was just so epic.That's the thing, Ready Player One was just one of those movies that made me wanna smile, all the way till I left the theatre. Okay, it's not the best movie I've ever watched, not even close, but I still really enjoyed it and I think watching it in cinemas helped with that (definitely wouldn't have felt like smiling if I'd been at home). It has so many epic moments that give you a rush, it's just such a great movie that Spielberg can add to his still-growing collections of classics.Okay firstly, I'm kinda young so I don't get most of the 80s references in the movie, so that element of the film is completely lost on me. Secondly, I've read that this movie isn't quite like the book; whether that's a good thing or bad thing I don't know, because I haven't actually read it...usually amongst the book fans, it's bad. I will say this though; I've only watched one movie that I feel accurately reflects the book- The Fault In Our Stars - and even that wasn't perfect. If you watch Ready Player One having read the book and get annoyed that it's not like the book or what you wanted, just don't be surprised.Basically, all I'm trying to say is that Ready Player One is a visually amazing and fun movie. We don't get action movies that are this visually amazing too often, and it's not going to be in cinemas forever, so don't miss it! Spielberg gives us, as always, a really wholesome plot with great characters, on top of some of the best visuals I've seen in a movie in a long time. Do yourself a favour this week and go watch this in cinemas. You. Will. Not. Regret. It.",9,0,2,1 April 2018
Baby Driver," Kinda overrated; what really makes this film stand out as an action film?
","Baby Driver has been remember as one the best action movies of 2017. And yet, once the hour and half had passed and the film had finished, the only word I had for the movie was disappointment. I had high hopes for the film; it's a standard car action film, centring around a driver nicknamed 'Baby' who works in a crime heist ring, helping to pull off jobs as the getaway driver after each heist. It's a typical premise, and yet it's made quite fresh by the music, with each scene choreographed stunningly to each song, and each song chosen to suit the scenes perfectly. And yet, I found myself quite disappointed on the whole by the film. First of all, it's not quite like a movie has never centred around music, especially older music as in this film, before. Guardians of the Galaxy is the first example that immediately comes to mind. This idea that Baby Driver is so 'original' because of its emphasis on music choreographed to the action scenes seems somewhat rubbish to me; I agree that it is done very well, and that it makes the film 'fresh', but I hardly think it makes the film unique in any way.This is the point I am trying to get at. Yes, Baby Driver is still a passable action movie. But by no means is it notably more original than other action films. The music, something that has been lauded by critics, is admittedly impressive, but what action film doesn't have music in it? And this is where I finally get to the plot of the movie; there's really nothing particularly unique about it, either. On the whole it's rather predictable; Baby gets essentially blackmailed back into the crime business for 'one last job', Baby has a tragic backstory, Baby falls for a girl, Baby begins to have second thoughts about everything...it's employing quite a decent amount of cliches.Okay, so a movie that isn't unique doesn't necessarily make it bad. All I'm trying to say is Baby Driver is just not as impressive as critics have made it out to be. Moreover, I think the bigger issue of the film is the plot rather than the originality.Without spoiling the plot of the movie, the payoff for one and a half hours leads to a rather dull climax and concluding scene. The whole climax is just such a disappointment for me, and it's kinda hard to say why without ruining the movie. Still, I feel like the plot's two main problems are its predictability and ultimate disappointment.I don't mean to focus on the negatives of the film. Don't get me wrong, the movie is good. Great acting is coupled with the brilliant music and amazing chase choreography. But the film just doesn't stand-out in any way for me. It deserves praise, because it definitely is a good action movie. It's just not 93% on Rotten Tomatoes good. Watch the film if you want a film filled with action. But don't expect a flawless work of art; as good as Baby Driver is, it's not perfect.",6,0,3,4 January 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Great film, well-rounded plot; confusing at times
","Captain America: Civil War is the third and final film in the Captain America trilogy. But I don't think of it as the third film, rather the thirteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or MCU. This film has a rich plot which will leave viewers entertained and thrilled, alongside the further development of the main characters that have graced the screens since the start of the MCU, including the title-character Captain America, and impressive action scenes. Yet this film struggles to keep Captain America in the limelight, with a plot those unfamiliar to the MCU will find confusing. Once you get into the film, although not as good as The Avengers films, this is a thriller and a must-see movie for 2016.The basis behind the movie is simple; set one year after the horrible events in Avengers: Age of Ultron, the team must sign a UN treaty which effectively denies the Avengers any rights of free movement, stripping them of their ability to fight crime around the world and create a path of destruction along their way, as has happened in the other movies. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) or Iron Man, who has had to deal with the burden of having created Ultron in Avengers 2, decides it's best if the team signs this treaty. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who is Captain America, disagrees and believes that signing the treaty is not the best thing for the Avengers.This entire concept of two of the most powerful men in the Avengers team against each other forms the basis of the film; a Civil War, namely between the individual Avengers themselves. Perhaps a little conveniently, half the team sides with Stark, half with Rogers. And so begins the war, each side fighting for what they believe in.What I liked about this Civil War idea was how it leaves the whole ''bad guys, good guys'' allocation to the audience for quite a portion of the film. We are aware that Tony Stark is a good guy, having seen the other MCU films, but so is Steve Rogers. Hence, while it soon becomes clear who is ''right'' and who isn't, having two ''good'' guys and two ''good'' sides opposing each other opens viewers up to a different kind of enemy, one of which is harder for viewers to pinpoint definitively.However, in reality the entire basis of the film is not just the Civil War, but also encircles that of the Winter Soldier, James Barnes (Sebastian Stan), returning from Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He plays a pivotal role in the movie, the audience's perception of him being changed from Captain America 2.Returning from Avengers: Age of Ultron are the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), alongside other characters from the MCU including Falcon, Ant-Man and War Machine. New appearances include the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland).All these characters star in the fight scene, featured in the trailer, which is easily one of the best fight scenes in the MCU, almost outshining those in the Avengers, simply for its ever-so simple concept; a Civil War between the Avengers.On the downside, it is this huge line-up of characters that forms part of the problem with this film. It drowns Captain America away as the title role in the film. He isn't completely submerged, with the film still able to identify him as the main protagonist. However additions such as Tony Stark have the inherent ability to dim away Steve's voice in the film. As the film progresses so too does Captain America's role diminish slightly. While fears of the film becoming Avengers 2.5 or Iron Man 4 before its release were thankfully not realised, this movie did still struggle to keep the limelight focused on Captain America himself.More notably is how the film struggles to find focus. It shifts between the Civil War of sorts, and the underlying protagonists of the story, attempting to give each character some attention. This was to some degree a mistake; while this will entertain those who know the MCU universe well, those purely watching for Captain America will be confused for sure.But I must digress; if you are going to see an MCU movie, any of them, it is best to at least know some basic background information about the timeline, to help your understanding of the film. This flaw of confusion is not intrinsic with this film but the fact that the MCU flows less like a collection of movies and more like a series, with each one flowing on to some degree from the last. Watching Captain America 2 then moving straight to 3 is not a smart choice, at the very least, watching Avengers 2 is necessary.To an extent the movie struggles to find its voice for half the film, as the building blocks are slowly put down for the film. This can be good too, though, allowing for more character development. Unlike the Avengers films, this movie is not teeming with fight scene after fight scene. Rather they are more spaced, and rightly so; any more fight scenes and this movie would have been indistinguishable from any other Avengers film.Having watched the other Avengers films, this movie doesn't quite live up to them, though it would be disappointing if this film outshone the Avengers. Instead, this film allows for an almost side-conflict set aside from the battles the Avengers are usually fighting together, instead exploring the consequences when a series of ''enhanced humans'' turn on each other.Captain America: Civil War is a stunning film which has helped withhold the reputation of the MCU. It is a film that has been well-developed in almost every important aspect, and certainly has helped hook viewers and set up for a dramatic conclusion in Avengers 3: Infinity War.",7,0,5,14 July 2016
Ocean's Eleven," Simply brilliant
","Ocean's Eleven sets out to be an engaging, thrilling yet fun heist movie, and it manages to accomplish just that. It's stunning, it's simple, it's brilliant. Everything about the movie, from the pacing to the acting and dialogue, is done with so much thought and so well.Ocean's Eleven has quite the typical heist film plot. A criminal, Danny Ocean (played by George Clooney) plans to pull off possibly the biggest heist in the history of the United States, planning to rob $160 million from three casinos in one night. It's no easy task, and he seeks out a team of people (eleven, to be exact), of which include great actors such as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Carl Reiner.I think it's easily the acting that makes this heist film such a standout from other similar films. Matt Damon is so innocent and yet so powerful, and Carl Reiner plays Saul very well, but for me the two best actors had to be George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Together their characters Danny and Rusty lead the team in real style, right from the get-go. Clooney plays his character stunningly, honestly yet with plenty of fun injected into it. Brad Pitt shines in his role, just so...amazing. The highlight of his character for me was easily when he casually got Basher out of an arrest. The dialogue in this movie couples itself perfectly with the acting. It's just such witty, fun dialogue. It's the type of dialogue many may cringe at, but if you're watching this movie you've got to remember that it's just trying to have fun. Everything from the content, the timing, the delivery of the lines, is done so well.Personally, and rather obviously, the highlight of the film had to be the heist. The movie doesn't waste time getting to the heist like other heist films (I'm looking at you Fast Five...which actually copied an awful lot from this movie), and once it gets to the heist it doesn't muck around. It just rolls with it, and it has plenty of witty fun along the way. The heist itself is clever, it's smart, it's brilliantly thought out by the characters and more importantly the writers of the movie.My two only gripes are rather minor; the ending and Basher's accent. I'm not even British but the cockney accent that Don Cheadele puts on can't possibly fool anyone; it's just so unnecessary and whoever suggested he use one should be fired. Also, I don't want to spoil the ending but I feel it could have gone just a little further. It's still great, it's just that it could have been perhaps more satisfying. Still, that's why there are sequels.Ocean's Eleven is just such a clever and yet heist film. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a thriller or is just looking for a quick way to kill two hours. You won't regret it.",9,1,2,6 January 2018
Get Out," Masterful, brilliant, spectacularly crafted horror movie that will have you on the edge of your seat
","Get Out is easily the best movie of 2017, managing to get the highly coveted 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. Once I finally decided to watch the movie, it was easy to see why. The basic idea behind the plot is this man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has decided to go spend the weekend with his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) and her parents, in an isolated home in Alabama. But, as the weekend progresses (and without revealing too much of the plot), Chris begins to discover something truly sinister.Jordan Peele, the director and writer, crafts this horror film so delicately, being sure to reveal things slowly and carefully as the film progresses. The plot is simply so original, unique and ingenious, and credit is due to Jordan Peele for all his decisions. He has us viewers believing one thing for the majority of the film, only to dash that aside for a far more sinister truth. This horror movie uses so many common horror tropes, and yet it expertly embraces and twists them into what truly is a masterpiece.The film also centres around racism, primarily the more subtle, liberal type that has arisen in society in modern times. Jordan Peele intertwines this message of racism so delicately throughout the film, and even though it's a horror movie there's plenty of poignant commentary of the state of racism today.Personally what I loved about the movie was the pacing, which allowed subtle hints to be sprinkled throughout the movie before the dramatic, sinister reveal. I also loved Kaluuya's acting; it was so raw and believable, and it really had you convinced of the true horror of what was going on throughout the film. Every second of the film we see his character responding and coming to terms with everything going on around him; it's genius.There were a few things that I didn't love about the film, but they're mostly plot related and I don't want to give spoilers. In my opinion it's not the 'perfect' movie, but it's so close the difference is honestly negligible. It's especially remarkable given that Jordan Peele is a first time director. Everything about this film - the writing, the acting, the pacing - is so clever, and there is praise due to everyone who worked on this movie. It really does prove that the world of Hollywood still has plenty more ideas to explore yet.",9,16,31,29 December 2017
Mission: Impossible II," Definitely improves on the first film, with better action and a simpler plot
","Mission Impossible II, the sequel to the original 1996 film, is a definite improvement in many regards. While the general consensus amongst critics seems to criticise the weak plot and poor characters, it doesn't focus on the positives of the film, namely the improved action, a simple narrative, and a brilliant music score.Mission Impossible I is renowned for a lack of action, with focus devoted to developing a plot so complicated no one has a chance of following it without pausing to think about it. Ethan Hunt is about the only person who gets any proper character development, and the film feels as though it drags on forever and ever (the theft of the NOC files felt like an eternity!)But Mission Impossible II is paced better, with an easier to follow plot, more character development and a music score that is far less boring than that of the first. Maybe the first has a more engaging plot (as confusing as it is), and the action scenes of this film may be unnecessary in some regards, but these aren't sins to the movie, and for the most part it is entertaining.The film stars actor Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, who, other than a new haircut, brings back the same stunning character from the first into the dangerzone. Tom Cruise, also acting as producer for the film, insisted on doing his own stunts, and does a brilliant job of portraying his character.The story is simple, which for some is reason for criticism, however I view it as a positive. Hunt is assigned the task of recruiting master-thief Naya (Thandie Newton), for a mission to take down suspected mole of IMF Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who is planning to release a disease, Chimera, and charge a hefty price on its antidote. In recruiting her, the pair form an intimate relationship, one of which will prove risky in regard to the mission. Having recruited the help of tech-whiz Luther (Ving Rhames) from the first film, and pilot Billy (John Polson), the four travel to the land down under, Australia, with Naya sent to infiltrate Sean's mansion in Sydney, using a method other than her thieving capabilities. It is this that bothers many viewers, as Naya plays a role no more than a romantic interest for most of the movie. However, there was only one major female antagonist in the first movie who did little more, so this is still an improvement.The film takes place in Sydney, the largest city in Australia. Perhaps being my home city I am biased, but it is great to finally see Sydney in an action film. However, unsurprisingly, the errors in geography bother me. There is absolutely no way the team would have landed in the middle of a desert, near Broken Hill, a town more than 1000km from Sydney, when arriving. out of the way to be doing so. It's moments like these that would make people think Sydney is smack-bang next to the desert; it isn't even close.I cannot see how Sean and Ethan get onto a semi-rural road towards the end of the film in the motorbike chase. I don't believe there is any such road, at least near to the CBD, though I could be wrong. It's also a shame the Sydney Harbour Bridge isn't part of the motorcycle chase in some way. However, this would have made even less geographical sense than it already did. There is also the fact that Sean somehow gets his car into Darling Harbour, which would have definitely turned eyes in a pedestrian- only precinct, but we can disregard this minor detail.The film can be commended for its romance, which while not perfect, is far better than the sloppy attempt at one in the first film. It also allows for development of another character other than Hunt himself. Sean Ambrose is a fairly decent villain, and is at least known for the entire film unlike Job in the first, allowing proper development of his character. However, just about every character other than Hunt could have done with more development.Action in this film is far better than that of the first. Combat scenes are much more engaging, including most prominently the motorcycle scene, and the theft scene is paced a lot better than that of the NOC files in the first. As mentioned the plot is far simpler, although there are many plot holes. The film's original cut was at almost 3 hours, which explains why many parts of the film do not make sense.The film features a score by Hans Zimmer who, infamous for his intertwining of electronic instruments into orchestras, brings a stunning rendition of the Mission Impossible theme, with electronic guitars and percussion that bring out the most intense action scenes.It's a shame more Australians didn't star in this film; John Polson is the only actor who plays an Australian in the film, who unsurprisingly has a stereotypical Steve-Irwin styled accent, and says the word 'mate' way too much. You'll be hard pressed to find an Aussie who actually sounds like that. While Richard Roxburgh is an Australian, his character Hugh Stamp is (apparently) South African.Overall, this film is a good watch. Perhaps the plot is simplistic, with characters who need more development. However, the action is far better, with the movie not being as close to slow and boring as the first. The romance is also greatly improved. Setting the film in Sydney, a city little seen on the silver screen, was a wise choice.This film is well worth a watch. Don't expect the best movie you've ever seen, but don't expect nothing either; you will be rewarded.",8,2,3,28 September 2016
American Made," Impressive story and stunning acting from Tom Cruise
","Tom Cruise continues to prove his worth as an A-List actor in this film based on the true story of Barry Seal, an American Pilot turned DEA agent and drug smuggler in the 70s-80s. The film can be praised for the brilliant acting from Tom Cruise, as well as the telling of the story in an organic yet simple manner, taking the viewers across a decade of Seal's life seamlessly.Having watched many Tom Cruise films, such as the Mission: Impossible movies and Edge Of Tomorrow, I had high expectations watching American Made. The film definitely did not disappoint. Even though the film is not so action-heavy like most Tom Cruise films, Tom Cruise plays his character of Barry Seal, a smug man way in over his head who, on more than one occasion, bites of more than he can chew. It's a little jarring to hear Tom with a southern twang, and at times he has a bit of difficulty maintaining it, reverting to whatever his natural accent is (I'm not American so the difference is probably more obvious to Americans). Still, other than the twang there's really nothing to fault about Tom's acting.Doug Liman, who has previously worked with Tom Cruise, directs the film very well, giving it an almost indie, homely feel at times. Shaky cameras and quick transitions between scenes help to evoke this. His choice to have Barry Seal narrating at times does seem a little strange at times, mainly since it's not nearly frequent or consistent enough. Still, the choice to give the film this more indie look is quite clever, especially given that the film's material is based around a simple man.Personally I thought the film's pacing could have been a little better. Sometimes the film does go a little fast, especially at the start, which holds it back from a 9 or 10 star rating in my opinion. Still, the film is a very quality watch, and I definitely recommend it for action-fans looking for a gripping true story.",8,1,1,24 December 2017
Black Panther," The hype is very real for this both typical and different Marvel movie; go watch it!
","Black Panther has been one of the most anticipated movies of 2018, hype building up globally as the world waited for its release. Its near perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes has done nothing but exacerbate this hype, and I can confirm that the hype is definitely justified. Black Panther probably won't start the conversations about race that some critics might have you thinking, but it's just such a tasteful, entertaining, unique movie that does so much more than your typical Marvel flick.The film is set about a week after the events of Civil War, where T'Challa's father was killed at a bombing at a UN Convention in Vienna. T'Challa is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his father and the king of Wakanda, the setting of the entire film. It's this struggle that the movie focuses on at first.The movie unfolds rather neatly, especially for a Marvel film, with the majority of the film centring in Wakanda. (Seems like Marvel's doing a lot more location centralisation; GOTG2 is mainly on Ego's planet, Thor: Ragnarok has a lot on Sakaar...it's better this way). I think some of the key highlights of Black Panther have to be the characters. Chadwick Boseman shines as T'Challa; seriously, his silent bad-assery is stunning. Shuri, T'Challa's sister, is probably my favourite character in the film, she's just really funny and sweet. Nakia and Okoye are both very powerful female characters in the film, both taking their turns in guiding T'Challa in his times of need.It's definitely the villain that many have really loved about this movie. Personally, while I loved Killmonger, I think maybe it would've been cooler if we got to delve a little more into his backstory and really understand his motives. Also, Claw is...just there...but when he is, he's fine. Martin Freeman returns as Agent Ross from Civil War, and while I'll readily admit I didn't need to see him back, it's nice to see him take on a bigger role in this movie as we delve more into his character.I feel like Marvel movies are slowly becoming more and more grounded as Marvel mature, and that definitely shows in Black Panther. The film is easily their most mature film yet; Thor: Ragnarok is plain fun, Spiderman Homecoming is just another packed Spiderman film, but Black Panther feels very deep and important. It explores very important themes, that of race, of T'Challa's moral battles, the theme of leadership and monarchy...Marvel have proved time and again that a superhero movie can be a comedy, and now they've just proven they can also be something so much more meaningful.You see, Black Panther is a very neat film. You can lose yourself in the stunning action of Avengers: Age of Ultron, but Black Panther will keep you engaged in its meaningful story, embroiled in its chief themes. All the characters shine as they deliver the movie's message about the challenges of being a leader, and the consequences of every action, big and small. I don't want to give the plot away, but its themes are what set it apart from any other Marvel film.Now, I can't say it's a perfect movie. I did like Killmonger, but let's be honest; at the end of the day, he's just another Marvel villain. Basically that means he just feels like he's there...never much of a huge threat. (I mean we already KNOW that Black Panther survives already, we saw him in the Infinity War trailer!) It's basically the same feeling for Claw. There's also Killmonger's girlfriend who we never really get to see that much of, which is sorta a shame, I guess I can forgive that though.Also, I think the soundtrack of this movie was a real highlight. I don't like trap music at all but I think it actually blended with this movie reasonably well. The soundtrack also sounded very traditional-African, especially given that Wakanda is a fake-country. That's actually one of the things you have to remember about this movie; it's as though it's trying hard to respect Wakandan culture, even though this culture is completely fictional. But hey, that's fine, right?In the end, there's isn't all that much to fault about Black Panther. I think its themes are its real strong point. Okay, so while it's got powerful themes at the end of the day it's still a superhero movie, so don't expect to be blown out of your socks. But still, it's just got such great, well-rounded characters that you find yourself really believing in, and a very nice, neat story. If you watch any movie before summer ends (it's summer here in Australia), make sure it's Black Panther. Many critics have called it the best movie in the MCU; I might not go quite as far to make that claim, but it's definitely close. Go and watch it, and make the choice for yourselves.",9,7,34,18 February 2018
Casino Royale," It's...good...
","I hadn't watched any Bond movies other than the most recent Spectre, and I decided to go back to Daniel Craig's first outing as Bond back in 2006. Quite honestly, I enjoyed the movie, just not enough.Casino Royale sees James Bond get his 007 status before going on a sinister mission to take down a man running a ''high-stakes poker game'' that has been betting against big world corporations. Honestly, I enjoyed a large part of the film. The first half of the film is enjoyable, quality, smart action that breezes by you spectacularly. I highly praise both the chase in Uganda and especially the airport scene. Daniel Craig plays Bond as a matter-of-fact, smug agent for this half of the movie (and, actually, the entire movie really). It's just the second half of the film that really gets too drawn out and confusing for me. James Bond goes to Montenegro with Vesper Lynd, going to participate in the poker game with Le Chiffre. Everything after this becomes slow and drawn out. Honestly, I would be fine with this slow pacing, except the whole plot felt a bit confusing for me. Maybe I'm just dumb, because this movie got universal acclaim, but it just felt like too much at times for me. That's not to mention that this movie is 2 hours 20 minutes, and for the entire last half hour I was just waiting for the movie to end. The best of the action is over by about the one hour mark in my opinion, and the entire remainder of the movie just feels boring. The little action that is left is, albeit, good, just not enough.Okay, so this movie doesn't need to just be non-stop action; that would be unreasonable. But the casino scene is just boring for me, which was a shame since it takes up a large part of the second half of the movie. Still, I digress; Casino Royale is a good movie. I enjoyed every bit of it, even if not the second half as much as the first half. Daniel Craig shines as James Bond, and the film is visually stunning. I have high hopes for the entire franchise going into the future. Maybe this film didn't wow me as much as it did others, but I still thought it was a good, enjoyable movie.",7,1,4,21 January 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Definitely one of the best action flicks ever made
","Mad Max: Fury Road is, hands down, one of the best action movies I've ever seen. It doesn't take its own sweet time with exposition, with dialogue or with establishment, it's just raw action from start to finish. It takes viewers on what is literally a non-stop ride through the desert, racing all the way to the end.I haven't watched any other Mad Max movies, but there's no need to watch the other three before watching Fury Road; everything still makes sense. The story follows Max (Tom Hardy) as he finds himself helping a driver of a war rig, Furiosa (Charlize Thereon) and her cargo of five women make their way through the desert. But there's a mob of in upwards of fifty vehicles behind them, hunting them down, led by the sinister Imortan Joe.Action movies are often slowed down by exposition and dialogue, and it's here that Mad Max: Fury Road excels. It doesn't waste it's time on exposition, not one bit. What's Valhalla? Why do the half-childs need blood sacks? Mad Max doesn't waste its time trying to explain every little detail, and it doesn't need to; the viewers just accept the absurdity of what's going on, letting us focus on the action. And that's the thing; the absurdity of everything is just so genius. Why is there a man playing a guitar on a truck? Who cares, just enjoy the movie!And the movie doesn't waste its time on dialogue either. This review is already longer than all the words Max says in the movie combined. It's just plain genius; Max is just this raw action hero, and we don't need his wild backstory, with him talking every second. We get to just watch this movie without the normal incessant dialogue of an action flick.That's where this movie definitely cements itself as one of the best action movies of all time. Never before do I think I've seen a movie that just has such non-stop action from the start to the beginning. The film must have a grand total of three static scenes where the protagonists just talk with one another. Everything else is just raw action, unfolding so quickly. The trucks chasing the war rig down are always in the horizon, and we're reminded of it just enough to remember the imminent threat posed to Max, Furiosa and everyone on the war rig. The actual action itself is so good; there's just so much, and the combat methods of both the attackers and defenders is so unique.The thing with Mad Max: Fury Road, is that it'll probably be the most unique action film you ever see. Right from the get-go the director throws us headfirst into a dystopian world, forcing us to just accept this and let the movie unfolds. And that's fine. Who cares how absurd everything might seem? Just enjoy the action!Mad Max: Fury Road is an amazing action movie. I recommend it to just about anyone, and especially to action die-hards. You won't regret it.",10,4,6,16 January 2018
