The Rock," Good movie
","Great story. Another contribution to the 'corrupt government covering its corruption' theme (vis-a-vis Outbreak).Ed Harris is awesome. His character for me is the most complex. He is a true sympathetic not-so-bad bad guy (like Gene Hackman in Crimson Tide AND Extreme Measures; they make you not only understand, but almost to root for them...almost. Harris here is about the closest).Connery is standard excellent. Cage gets on my nerves with his whining voice. I can think of several other actors who could have played this role without getting on my nerves. But, anyways...I love when movies like The Rock make us question our assumptions; when they challenge us to reconsider ethical dilemmas, what is right or wrong in life.Plenty of action. Very significant scene when the soldiers squared off.
I'd love some more development of why Hummel's team fell apart as it did. I study social psychology and could write a paper on why, but the movie didn't supply enough info to make it plain enough (or, it did but I must have missed it).One shortcoming -- we never saw the hostages again after they were first locked up during the tour. They were referred to in the presidential soliloquy (which I hated; the portrayal of the president in this film was critical to the dilemma value in the movie; contrast this presidential portrayal with what we see in Air Force One, or, better yet, Independence Day) but we never see them again; how can we feel for them? (Perhaps this was what made it so easy for the prez to make the decision he made, above and beyond the fact that to admit wrong was politically out of the question).Loved it.",7,2,2,8 February 2000
Terminator Salvation," Thumbs down
","I usually don't write 'in reaction' to seeing a movie, however, on a number of levels, I've come to some clarity on how I feel about Terminator Salvation.First (and this really helped me to be okay with my hesitation to embrace this film), I left the theater asking myself 'what do I think of this movie, how do I feel?' and it dawned on me that having to ask is the problem - with previous Terminator movies (yes, even T3), it wasn't hard to decide, based on feeling alone, yeah or nay. The Terminator was just a whole lot of fun in a way previous sci-fi movies hadn't been able to achieve; T2 was a breathtaking statement with remarkably poignant scenes, while at the same time delivering special effects and action that changed things fundamentally; T3 was, for me, provocative, and the more I thought about it, the more I grasped some remarkable things. In all three, how I felt was clear, and I enjoyed them.Which brings me to my next issue with Terminator Salvation: it fails the 'KISS test' ('Keep It Simple, Stupid').A good comparative to this is with the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The original trilogy was not only groundbreaking, not only an epic saga, but it was simple enough for a kid to get. The prequel trilogy was so complicated it takes real thought for me to figure out all the new characters and plots and conflicts; it became a mess, exactly the opposite of what it originally was.By the time I arrived at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, I got the idea, and even chuckled to myself. I said 'the franchise is complete, we've come full circle. You can't stop the war, we knew that, the terminators came back because they were losing the war.' But we knew enough - John Conner would lead a resistance, the machines would calculate that they were losing and hatch this crazy plot, going back in time, in a ditch effort to eliminate the source of their demise, the mother of John Conner. But, John Conner would not be killed in the past, our present, so that time would remain in an endless loop where machines neither won out or were prevented from existing at all. And such would be the conundrum of a movie based on the non-entity of time travel.So, at the end of T3, I had no need for a sequel. While I wanted 'more terminator', I had a sense of peaceful resolution that 'the story', such as it was, had been told.Then I heard a T4 was in the making, and I was really excited. 'Ok,' I thought, 'so we're going to go into the future and see the world from which Arnold and Robert Patrick came, somewhat as it appeared from Reese's telling in T1.' We had visions of humans scraping to get by, HKs in the black skies and dog-fearing terminators infiltrating human dwellings, eyes like laser sights piercing the squalor...I thought that we had a simple story to stick to.Terminator Salvation was anything but. A new main character we knew nothing about, and which was used questionably to advance on the simple story that had somehow manages to engage us for 3 previous films.Characters who demonstrate no development at all. Very little in the way of endearing emotive connections, no intimacies or anything remotely smacking of the human compassion and conditions for which humans were supposed to be fighting anyway, save for one scene where a woman says she feels a man's warmth, only to find out...well, although I warned there'd be spoilers, when you see it you'll appreciate how odd it was that this be the place and the characters to provide emotion, where in previous it was between Sarah and Reese and Sarah and John and John and the Terminator and Sarah and the Terminator, you know, the main characters.From what I gathered in that article, the original script wasn't much better.It seems that, any way you slice it, the original simple story was of such perfection that there was no place to go; which is supported by the fact that both the original script and this dog's breakfast of a re-write both fail monumentally.Terminator has had such an impact, and set the bar so high, it really was unreasonable to expect that level could be maintained.",5,1,4,26 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," getting there.
","For the Star Wars fan, this movie is a little better an effort than what appears to have gone into Phantom Menace, but it still isn't landing with the solidity of any of the 'first three' (which are the last 3, because...oh, nevermind, if you don't understand, little else will make sense from here on out).1st of all, I did very much appreciate seeing 'Obi-Wan' in his relationship as master to young Annakin. I already can appreciate his own arrogance and the reason why he might have become a recluse after 'losing' Annakin to the dark side.One real problem for me is that these prequels (Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones) technically happened 'before' Episode IV A New Hope, Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, and Ep. VI Return of the Jedi. Yet, the technology we're seeing in these prequel films is more advanced than anything we saw in Episodes 4-6. (R2-D2 has jet propulsion legs? C'mon!) That just seems like a lack of production integrity. To compete with the special effects glitz of today's films, Lucas has himself given in to the dark side, thinking that the story of Star Wars requires increasing amounts of cheesy FX. Perhaps what he should do is redo Episodes 4-6 so that we can see what he apparently really wanted to present before he had the technology to do it.Now, another thing that ticks me off is that, in Episodes 4-6 you really did feel like you were in 'a galaxy far far away,' where there were little connections to 'our way of life.' They didn't swear, etc... Starting in Phantom Menace, however, a very disturbing reflection of our reality has presented itself, and by the time we see Attack of the Clones, it's disgusting. Me and the wife were sitting there saying 'oh, that's an ancient Greco-Roman setting there, and here's a little Asian thing happening here, and...I mean, sheesh.It has dawned on us that Lucas is not only completing the story for the fans he won back in nineteen hundred and seventy seven, but he's trying to win new fans, with FX and cheesy action scenes. The entire first real chase scene after the attempted assassination by intelligent millipedes from hell was totally gratuitous eye-candy that had nothing to do with real story.Speaking of story, I do appreciate that love, passion, has always been a part of Star Wars (in Ep 4, we kinda wanted to see Luke and Leia hook up, but by Empire Strikes Back we could dig that it'd be Han Solo who 'gits the girl' while Luke is destined for greater things). But, honestly, this so-called romantic story was poorly done. Lucas should have hired a romance-writing consultant, cause it just ain't his bag.Who is Dooku? He's not in Episode 1, yet he's now so powerful? Stupid.Finally, I am curious. (minor spoilers following). There is now just one more segment to present - episode 3. At the end of episode 2, Attack of the Clones, there is no Vader yet. Annakin is still a Jedi, albeit a married one. Now, at the beginning of Episode 4, Darth Vader chases down Leia Organa, a 20-something senator, but not before she's dispatched the two droids to Tatooine to look for the hiding Kenobie...at the end of episode 2, Leia and Luke aren't even conceived yet. All in the upcoming Episode 3, we are supposed to see Annakin become Vader, take his place at the right hand of the Emperor Palpatine (who is never seen in Episode 4), and Luke and Leia are supposed to be born and grow up?That'll be interesting to see.",Null,0,0,24 July 2002
Predator," One of the all-time classics
","Schwarzenegger redefined the action genre, owned the action 80s, and this may be his finest.It doesn't have as much campy fun gore as, say, The Running Man or Total Recall, but somehow manages to come off a little less serious than Terminator.But that said, it has remarkable tension, such that, years after the unknown element is removed, it still keeps you at the edge of your seat.As you may have read from all the other reviews, shortcomings aside, this is one fun flick. I liked the fact that the creature, which was the focal point of the film, was totally unknown to the 'bad guys' who tricked Dutch and his team into going; the creature turned out to be a very unpleasant surprise even for Carl Weathers' character.I also liked the sinking feeling of doom as the team founditself in grave danger of an unknown, unseen threat -- it was a very good interpretation of what Vietnam might have felt like for those who never experienced the psychological terror of an unseen enemy in the thick of the steamy jungle.One thing that bugged me was that Dutch missed the creature when he had him in his sights -- I mean, crack commandos don't miss a life-and-death shot like that, do they? They should have directed an alternate reason for missing, like a little jungle animal behind Dutch causes the creature to turn his way or something...But, nonetheless, see it. Predator is one of the greats. Predator 2 is decent also, in terms of clarifying the purpose of the alien creature -- as much as we may feel hate for the alien creatures, low and behold, they show us what we, as humans, might look like to other creatures here on earth, when we hunt for sport. - should we hate ourselves as well?",Null,1,2,31 May 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," subtle genius
","The response to this film would be warmer had it not been for the monumentally substantial act of Terminator 2 (hereinafter referred to as T2) that it had to follow. The campy fun of The Terminator (T1) was absent in T2, which took a dramatically dark tone. It was longer, more philosophical, probed many intellectual themes and generally changed the way action films are done, by offering more than just shoot-em-up and car chases.Anyway, I LOVED T3. It brought back a little of the campy fun of T1 while offering a stingingly direct approach to some issues that were dealt with in a more indirect artful way in T2.WARNING - THERE WILL BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW - SEE the film and then come back for the rest of this review.By the end of T2, we really thought that 'it was over,' that they had taken action to change the future. Here in T3, the T-800 tells an incredulous John Connor 'it can't be stopped, it is inevitable.' We, the audience, join John in not believing, and hope they are able to stop SkyNet's assumption of control... at the end of the film, the screenplay really is genius, as we join John and Kate Brewster in the numbing realization that, indeed, no matter what they do, judgment day cannot be averted.It's really a funny slap in the face for us sitting in our seats watching this film. Although time travel is currently understood to be at least inaccessible to us at this time, (if not altogether impossible), we all missed something very simply - way back in T1, we saw that the world had been overrun by the machines, and they were losing to the resistance, so they sent a terminator back to kill the mother of the leader. Clearly, judgment day had happened, and the resistance did form, fight, and turn the tide. So, everything in T2 still couldn't avert judgment day...we already knew in T1 that, somehow, despite Sarah Connor's efforts with help from the T-800, the resistance would still have to fight in a post-apocalyptic period to overcome the HKs and T-800 infantry...yet we still wanted to believe the 'real story' was about averting it.Now we're seeing that the 'real story' will take us beyond judgment day, to the brink of the end of humanity, when a resistance force will be lead by Neo...oops...John Connor (yes, we all see the similarity in themes between these two films...!)In T3, Arnold's acting in the character of the T-800 is really amazing. He tells John (and the audience in so doing) that he is NOT the same 'personality' as the T-800 in T2, that they roll off the assembly line (setting up a T4 with MULTIPLE ARNOLDS!!!!)...this T-800 did show some 'memory' (zero casualties, keys in sun visor), but that's only because the chip was somehow either retrieved or a copy was not destroyed when they blew up Cyberdine, I missed it specifically).Whatever, this T-800 must relate to John differently than it did in T1 or T2...and Arnold did bring across a sense of distance, very abruptly offsetting the intimacy shared between John and 'his terminator' in T2 -- far from a bad acting job, this is sheer acting brilliance, in my opinion!!When Cameron did T1, he may not have realized the franchise he'd stumbled into...T2 was so much more than just a sequel, so much more than just an action movie...and also not the shortest film ever made.
T3 was quite short, and ends with a cliff-hanging 'stay tuned' not seen since Star Wars, Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back - it's OBVIOUS this installment was just a necessary bridge towards the next installment, beyond judgment day. I suspect Cameron may get back into T4...but even if he doesn't, Mastow did well in trying to carry this franchise forward with a nod to its heritage (like bringing back Earl Boen's Dr. Silberman character - the way that scene was shot shows clearly Mastow knew his audience, I joined the folks in the theatre laughing at merely the recognition of his voice, before his face was finally shown on camera - perfect!)BRING ON T4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,1,1,7 July 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," more than just action/entertainment
","Few people seem able to step back and see a bigger picture -- assuming Arnold to be just a muscle-bound action hero doesn't do justice to his body of work.Has anyone noticed that many of his films deal with profound issues? The idea of aliens on Mars and implanted memory from Total Recall is as provocative as the issues of artificial intelligence in computers of the Terminator series; and then there are the intelligence issues of Eraser, or another commentary on alien and human behaviour in Predator -- this is a far cry from the more benign action fluff of car chases andexplosions...But anyway, the two most powerful scenes in the film for me are:1. the first entrance of Arnold, which only impacts you if you've seen the first movie first - if you haven't seen either, do not see 2 until you've seen one - to do so would be to spoil your viewing experience (if reading these reviews hasn't already).2. the scene where the T2000 is smashing Arnold's head with the heavy equipment towards the end of the film; the music creates a dark doomed feeling I've scarce experienced in modern film.The theme of the predator becoming more human while Linda Hamilton becomes more mechanic is pure cinematic/directing genius. The statements about the human experience, and our future, is serious. this is no vain glitter action film -- there'splenty of things to really think about.I'm almost tempted to raise this film above and beyond the genre of action, because it is so much more than a story of good guys shooting up bad guys.",9,1,1,28 June 2000
Independence Day," Great spin on essential theme; must see & think
","First of all, let's dispense with the negatives.(1) Typical American 'we're number 1' drivel, but what's new? Get over it. (2) Some weak main characters. Awfully cartoonish at times. (3) Too much convenience. Will Smith's girlfriend finding him across the destroyed nation, gimme a break. (4) Fill in your own (and, sure, there were plenty from which to choose).For those who want a summer-time fx popcorn movie, no complaints. It delivered.For thinkers, the essential theme is overcoming the dark side, as seen in films like Apocalypse Now, the Star Wars story (they shout it in your face throughout the trilogy), or Falling Down (Robert Duvall, Michael Douglas).The protagonist sees in the antagonist his own dark side. The decision to overcome the dark side usually means some form of destruction of the antagonist by the protagonist, whether in symbol or literal death, to confirm the rejection of temptation to give in to the dark side.This film symbolizes the alien nature of humans in earth's history. One fellow wrote a review here mentioning the invasion of Mexico in the 16th century; one may also consider what they native North American folks must have felt when the Europeans arrived. Or even how animals feel when they are displaced by 'aliens in flying machines destroying their homes to take away the resources' (gee, folks, the crop duster character...).This movie is telling us to feel about ourselves the way we felt about the alien threat. Shucks, they came in the first place because they had consumed their planet's resources. Doesn't that sound like us?! (deforestation, water and air pollution, are we that oblivious to what's happening?) War has involved pillaging resources for thousands of years, from fighting over share of the hunted herds to fighting over the land to cultivate to fighting for the gold...And, let's not even begin to talk about colonialism and slavery...Notice also that the crop duster is the one 'worthy' to destroy the aliens by sacrifice; he seems to judge himself at the same time, and as it were justifies his killing them by dying with them.There is a whole lot in this film.Compare the presidential characterization in this movie versus, say, The Rock.Or, how about the scene where Will Smith punches out the alien - preposterous, we might say. But, think about it -- if the creature is carbon-based, and if the whole universe came from one big bang start, why can't it be as fragile as earth-bound carbon-based forms? We have this idea that, if we ever met an alien, it must be stronger - why? who's ever authenticated a meeting with one to say?If you missed all this (and so much more, but there's a limit here!), you may need to watch it again.",8,0,1,7 June 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Excellent follow-up
","All in all, it was fun ... (minor spoilers ahead)...When we were anticipating the release of JP1, there were a couple of things going on that almost guaranteed it would be successful... - we just wanted to see dinosaurs alive, and no film had really made a realistic vision of this (Godzilla movies just don't cut it) - when the movie got going, Spielberg did it right, by first showing the gentle giants shaking the ground and moving in herds as though we were at the zoo; we were indeed at an amusement park, and it was wonderful (and that musical score was perfect, carrying our emotion) - the first introduction of the T.Rex was movie-making genius. All of a sudden we were thrust headlong into an unexpected and absolutely terrific, relentless onslaught of abject 'will this ever end?' terror; the fairy tale amusement park ride became a life and death struggle against a pure killing machine, punctuated by our watching a lawyer get eaten right before our very eyes (it was so terrible we actually felt sorry for the lawyer...um...kind of...)OK, so now that we'd seen dinosaurs, pretty ones and mean-as-hell ones, how could they give us JP2? How could they go beyond the initial awe of seeing them, and how could they create new ways to terrorize us now that we know we weren't going to see 'Dino and Barney'?Well, with few hitches, they did exactly that.Granted, the subplot with 'the man and the woman' was stupid, in my opinion, and totally unnecessary. In fact, she was irritating.The inclusion of a daughter of a different race than the father was interesting, especially as it came with absolutely no explanation, showing that plenty of living had occurred between JP1 and JP2. Life is like that, sometimes, though.The development of the theory that T.Rexes cared for their young was splendid and capitalized on the popularity of the T.Rex as a character. The scenes demonstrating and developing this were superb.The terror scenes were indeed terrific, as only that 'run or you'll get eaten' terror must be.JP2 --> JP1 is not quite the same as The Empire Strikes Back --> Star Wars, but it was a fun ride in itself.",Null,0,1,12 October 2001
The Number 23," not as bas as critics suggest
","SPOILER ALERT - Only read this review after you have seen the movie. In my opinion, you would not be wasting your time in seeing it, but if you do, reading this review will help confirm that, contrary to what so many others might argue.Jim Carrey continues to infuse his work with a hint of religious or moral message - this movie ending with a Bible quote may have triggered sub-conscious rejection by all those who out and out hate on this movie, which does have a pleasant ending.The ending, by the way, has the protagonist saying something to the effect that 'this may not be the ending you want, but it's the way it should be,' as they protagonist did 'the right thing' at his own cost.The movie isn't really about the number 23, although on the surface everyone wants to make it out as such. That's the problem - it's disappointing if the issue is supposed to be about the numerology, weak as it may be.This is a film about a disturbed fellow who killed someone, hid the body, framed an innocent man who went to prison for the murder; wrote a confession which one of the psychiatrists who dealt with his treatment took possession of and rewrote as a novel. That novel manages to end up in the protagonist's hands, and as he reads he can't help but recognize parallels in his own life that begin to awaken the repressed memories he had of his real life before the attempted suicide.The madness in which he wrote the book; the re-write that obscured some of the real connections, and his own psyche are the reasons the protagonist had to go through the process the movie follows.Ultimately, upon remembering everything that happened, what he did, etc., his decision to 'make things right' by admitting to the crime, freeing the wrongfully convicted, and being sentenced to serve time for his crime, all on the basis that as a father who wants to send a clear message to his son about justice, this was the right thing to do, is satisfying.The meandering path the movie followed to get to that point may not have been perfect, and the somewhat preachy tone of the narrative followed by the imposing Biblical quote from Numbers 32:23, 'your sins will find you out,' may rightly have left a bad taste in some viewers mouths.But, the resolution that a crime that had not been properly solved was now clear and a person who owns up to his guilt and anticipates a life of clarity after facing his consequences with the full support of his family appeals to one's inner sense of rightness and goodness and honesty and justice.Perhaps we've become so jaded and cynical in the current state of affairs in our world today that such purity can't be taken at face value.I would suggest, however, that the manner in which the protagonist's mental condition was presented is a tad curious. Could someone go through such a change of condition over time, from a confused young man from a home with a father who commits suicide who kills his girlfriend in a jealous rage, buries her, frames an innocent to take the fall, writes a convoluted confession infused with pseudo-numerological rantings and then jumps to his intended death to a psychiatric hospital for therapy who leaves the institution 'cured' even though he has no recollection of what happened? What life could he possibly have? He settles down in a job which he keeps, has a beautiful wife, a cool teen kid for a son, and mental and emotional stability with no relapses, no recurring nightmares that seem oddly real, no nothing until the book shows up through 'providential' circumstances? Are we really to believe the dog saw him bury the woman, understood this to be wrong, and showed up at the restaurant knowing the protagonist would be along and would allow the dog to lead him to the grave, which triggered no recollection in his mind at the time? And, why would his wife remove the bones of the girl? If she knew nothing of his past, she'd have no motive to 'protect him' from anything, since she would not have assumed the bones had any connection to him.There are not a few questions that pull at the over-all execution of the story in film. A perfect movie this is not.But I've seen plenty stupider movies get much better reviews than this one, and that seems odd to me. A movie with a moral message needs to be given the benefit of the doubt, in my opinion, because too much time is spent on senseless entertainment that often must pander to the lowest sensibilities (toilet humor, sex, violence for the sake of it) and leaves nothing to inspire any sense of higher ideal. This movie attempts to do so. Maybe poorly, but the attempt itself is worthwhile.",7,1,2,10 January 2009
Event Horizon," major disappointment
","I really wanted to like this dog, I really tried to find SOMETHING redeeming about it. No film should make its viewer work so hard.The topic of time/space travel, of bending space to travel through time, were great in the trailer to get me to go and rent this video.The revolving magnetic thingy reminded me of the contraption they built in Contact (which is a splendid film, one for the ages in my opinion); the space orb that gets into your head reminded me of Sphere.However, this...this, 'film' (and I use the term loosely here) was just bad. I like Lawrence Fishburn, I like Kathleen Quinlan, and Sam Neil, but, sheeesh, this film was just bad.I shouldn't even bother to warn of SPOILERS because I'd honestly recommend never wasting your time with this film, but incase you do have a need to see for yourself, skip this next paragraph, and then come back to it after you've watched.I just wonder WHY? Why would any parallel universe be so black and white 'evil', and why would it want to torture people? And, if it was really out looking for people to torture, why not just use 'itself' to travel to earth and pick up humans to its heart's content?I've seen some bad movies in my day (Mimic, Deep Blue Sea, etc) but this one was just painful.I don't hold this against any of the actors, either. Every once in a while a bad script is taken up with hope by an actor looking to bring something to the screen. But, man, as a sci-fi, it had no feel of authenticity, no reasonable situations (Dr. Weir says 'hey, that's not a load-bearing structure' and macho driver says'it is now' -- I mean, REALLY, if you've travelled '3 billion miles' and care about your life, would you ignore the specialist who's sent to guide you, and risk scuttling the whole mission? It was just stupid), no engrossing, engaging 'OK, I'm into this story...'Sorry for ranting. I just had to get that off my chest. This film wasbad.",Null,0,1,13 August 2001
Pulp Fiction," A study in redemption
","Warning - mild spoilers.For Tarantino, this seems to be an idea he is contemplating (thorugh various analogies and story lines in various of his movies).Those who are easily distracted will miss it. Although violence is a hallmark of Tarantino films, that's not what it's all about. In this one, 6 people are entwined in a collision course with redpemption. Some will be changed, some will not. The two primary characters who develop are Jules and Ringo. They are surrounded by a number of characters who do not display any real development, yet themselves experience situations they are drawned into and emerge on the other side having been redeemed.Redemption is the final aim of the entire Godfather series, which many consider to be among the greatest movies of all time. And, another, Shawshank REDEMPTION, again explores this theme. And hey, isn't that what 'Return of the Jedi' was all about? Clearly, the idea is deep-rooted and forms the basis for a good storyline.Tarantino's process is masterful, artistic, challenging.",9,0,1,2 January 2006
Tombstone," very good western
","I don't know much about what is 'truth or fiction' where the real story of Wyatt Earp is concerned, but, as a western, this film is absolutely splendid.There is a real feel for the west of the time, a time when the battle with the natives is no longer an issue, but the juxtaposition of white and Mexican cultures comes more towards the fore (how many people know that 'Mexico' once included everything from Mexico to Utah?!). It has a feel for the way in which law was managed in these alienated towns, long before information technology and central intelligence could unite national law enforcement, and 'the law' in any given town was simply the local sheriff, who didn't spend 2 or 3 years in a law enforcement program at the local community college, he just walked into the local sheriff's office and said 'I wanna work with you' and when he was the last man standing whom the people trusted, he'd be sworn in.In this story, Wyatt Earp comes riding into town, and installs himself as a protector, able to negotiate a fee for keeping rif-raf out of a local establishment, simple as that. It was mighty easy back in those days to just saddle up your horse, go somewhere else and start all over. No real estate agents, no hiring moving companies, no sending change of address cards to all your creditors, no having to prove employment or demonstrate good credit in order to get a new place, no having to come up with 'first and last,' no reference checks... no hassles with the phone company to change your service, no worries about 'no vacancy' or high mortgage interest rates...no decision about whether to live 'closer to downtown with more crime but access to amenities or out in the suburbs with bigger lots but a longer commute to work'...never having to fight for a tight parking spot...instead of having to buy a new car, you just owned some horses that could have babies...The gun culture and gun play is remarkable. Folks would walk into an establishment and check their guns the way we today check our coats. Itchy trigger fingers abounded, and a man watched his adversary's eyes for the slightest hint as to whether this was going to be the showdown, right here, right now, or whether they'd walk away to square off another day. When they did finally square off, the townsfolk treated 'another dead body in the middle of town' almost matter-of-factly. A shout-out was almost like the only real family entertainment. Folks didn't hide between shuttered windows, they lined the streets for a front-row seat!As I mentioned in my comments on 'The Quick and the Dead,' Tombstone is a much more authentic movie (of course, that's a matter of conjecture, since I wasn't 'there' living in Colorado in 1830 :-) but guns just weren't that accurate. Also, Tombstone is a lot 'darker' - after all, they didn't have overhead lights the way we do today, after sundown it was bloody dark! I also found it rained a little too much in The Quick and the Dead, and it seemed to rain quite a bit in Tombstone as well (forgive me, but when I think of the west, I think of arid desert conditions where rain just doesn't happen a whole lot - although I'm no meteorologist and perhaps both movies were filmed during the rainy season...??)Both movies also had a good view of medicine back then. If you got shot, chances are you were either done for, or you'd have some ugly scars. Doctors couldn't do a whole lot more than pour whiskey on the wound and into your mouth, while they either tried to remove bullets without anesthesia or stood over your abdominal wounds and just shook their head 'nope, he ain't gonna make it.' (and, in The Quick and the Dead, the presence of the undertaker was an interesting note, grim with his black hat!)Anyway, there are some bad guys running the town, and 'the people' beg the Earp brothers, with some help from their old friend quick-gun Doc Holliday, to restore some law and order in this town. In this story, Kurt Russell is the reluctant Wyatt who is dragged into conflict with the bad guys due to his brothers giving in to put badges on their chest; this leads to the showdown, and a final reckoning of who will run things in Tombstone.If you want the true story of Wyatt Earp, do some surfing, there are plenty of websites offering their versions of who he was, good or bad. If you want to see a good story of how life was in the west, see Tombstone!",Null,0,1,27 December 2002
X2: X-Men United," the franchise is growing
","There used to be a time when the word 'sequel' was anathema, but these days we've come to expect the sequel to be better. While a few sequels of late have been throwbacks to that previous era when they were poor, the recent trend has been that the sequels are better, and such is definitely the case here with X-men 2.If you actually read Marvel comics and know 'the X-Men' story/characters, you'd enjoy some of the nifty things that were tossed into this movie (may be considered SPOILERS by some, but check out LebowskiT1000 comments, especially his PS notes...)This movie was pretty good. My personal incling is that Xavier is a tad naive and foolish, because his students seem far too docile when he could have quite the army at his disposal (for example, -- again,  possible spoiler -- Iceman really only made one contribution to their struggle throughout the entire movie, hardly a 'superhero' but perhaps they were somewhat influenced by the fragile 'becoming' concept they developed with Spider-man).Anyway, the story is good, the action is good, and it has been released at a good time (before Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, which are far darker, less feel-good movies but will land with a more resounding thud in the action/tension category).One interesting note - Derrick Dunn (IcebergGucci21@aol.com) mentioned that this movie has become his favourite sequel, replacing Blade 2 as his favourite comic book sequel. I find this interesting...and here's why...For those who loved The Matrix, watch Blade 1 which was released before it, and you'll see very clearly that some of our most beloved and copied 'Matrix scenes' (the fashion, the bend-backwards-to-avoid-bullets, etc) were in fact ripped from Blade 1, yet it gets no credit for it...??So, as my wife and I walked out of the theatre after watching X-Men 2, I commented that the plot followed the Blade 2 concept of the good guys and bad guys having to mistrustingly join together to fight a more lethal common enemy that threatens them both. Again, Blade 2 continues to be a key influence/trendsetter on major action flicks, and chances are that, again, X-Men 2 may be remembered for it while Blade 2 is forgotten...why? I dunno, but I see a pattern here.(for those who haven't seen them, trust me, Blade 1 and 2 are about the best most-underrated comic book action films ever made - in fact, I didn't read a lot of either series, but the screenplay in Blade is absolutely sumptuous, you can see clearly it is a comic-turned-live, it's so well-done).In closing, yes, X-Men 2 was fun, some heavy characters had short scenes (Colossus was awesome, and is BEGGING for more screen time!), but overall it was a real blast.X-Men 3 should be a real blast, can't wait!",Null,0,0,4 May 2003
The Matrix," positively splendid
","I can't begin to express how much I enjoyed this film. I planned not to see it, until a friend of mine referred to it in a discussion we were having. I'm not a Keannu Reeves fan, and thought it'd just be fluff, but when he referred to it in the context of our discussion, it definitely raised my eyebrows, so I rented it, and was glad I did.For any who have pondered the enduring questions in life, this film is delightful. The fundamental issues of reality (metaphysical questions), knowledge and truth (epistemological questions) and a little bit of axiology are wrapped in a slick futuristic skin.At the point Reeves' character is first introduced into the matrix, and has difficulty believing what is 'real,' I asked the question out loud just as Lawrence asked it: 'what IS reality?' Ringing with relevance and clarity, this movie presents hyperbolie in addressing some of the nagging questions in life.Skim an introductory philosophy textbook if this is unfamiliar territory -- after doing so, you may just agree with me that this is definitely one for the ages.",8,0,0,20 October 2000
The Matrix," not original, but intriguing no less
","I commented previously, but had to add that this movie isn't all that original. Humans have been targets for annihilation/cultivation by all kinds of thingies (Body Snatchers, Terminator, etc...). Matrix takes a fresh angle, but it's not altogether purely original.MINI SPOILERS AHEAD - Further, in terms of action and style, go and rent Blade and see for yourself that Matrix downright copies almost too much of the Blade screenplay, including and especially the big scene where they enter the building to rescue Morpheus (the black leather overcoats, the glasses, the gun play, etc...) And, let's not forget the most famous and copied Matrix thing - Neo's bullet-dodging moves are just frames spliced right out of the scene in Blade when Blade shoots at Frost and he dodges the bullets, in slow mo', leaning backwards...I'm at a loss for explaining how Matrix got sooo much media coverage for these scenes and Blade got absolutely nothing...but if you watch Blade and then watch Matrix you'll probably also shake your head and wonder...It'll be interesting to see if Matrix Reloaded is as good a sequel as Blade II was.",8,0,1,23 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Superlatively masterful
","Darth Vader may indeed be the greatest 'bad guy' in all movie history. This part of the story is his chapter, his finest hour. Everthing goes his way. If you're a betting man, lay your money on the Dark Lord of the Sith.Anyway, this film has a darkness, a heaviness, a cloud over it. The Empire indeed does strike back, and in a big way. We begin to appreciate that the nice neat story in Star Wars ain't over by a long shot.
In that final showdown between Luke and Vader, the music and action is moving beyond words. Vader's voice, booming and ominous, tells Luke 'You underestimate the power of the dark side.'The showdown between Luke and Darth Vader climaxes in what might be the most shocking one-liner of all time when Darth asks Luke 'Obi-wan never told you what happened to your father,' Luke replies 'You killed him,' and Vader says 'no Luke, I...am your father. Search within yourself, you know it to be true. Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.'My goodness! Has ANY movie EVER left you hanging on for the sequel you knew had to come?!I'm also a little confused by reviewers who criticize the contributions of Yoda. 'The Force' is what this entire story is all about. When all the movies are finally produced, take a week and watch them all, one each night, with the last two shown back to back on a Saturday night or Sunday. From the first episode to the last, it's always been about the force, and the balance in the galaxy.",9,0,1,14 December 2002
Contact," Must see, and must think
","Contact, for me, was simply a perfect statement of the need for appreciating that reality is most probably beyond the reach of one discipline by itself.The science/religion dichotomy should be accepted as, well, not good enough. Ellie, representing the scientist, is faced with experience that lies beyond her scientific explanation, yet she cannot let go of its reality to her.Palmer Joss is excellent, not as the representative of the religious, but as representative of the position we might do well to take - the line between the two extremes, the balance-seeker who can communicate beyond his own language (not one Bible text quoted, yet a decent defence of the room for 'God').The bigger antennae is not a matter of technology, but, as we see in the last scene, of tuning in, making 'contact' not with what's 'out there,' but with what's inside of us - is it not more than just atomic activity?Meaning - a key theme, is shown to be lacking in the outlook on life these days, lacking in the continual pursuit of technological advance. Science alone is insufficient to give meaning that we are able to conceive and contemplate.This is a relevant thinking movie, for those who've thought that science and religion must antagonize. Too bad the limit is 1000 words, I could go on and on...See Contact, and make contact!",9,1,3,5 May 1999
