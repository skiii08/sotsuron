Skyfall," 'Bond'. 'James Bond'. um-mm... 'M' and the 'bad guy' too.
","Do not get me wrong. This is a fantastic movie. Totally worth the admission ticket. And worth watching again by purchasing another admission ticket the same week. But I cannot really call this a Bond movie. When I watch a Bond movie, I want to see a movie which is about Bond. I should be rooting for Bond the entire time seated at the edge of my seat and wishing for bad things to happen to the villain in the hands of Bond. What I really look forward to is watching a movie that builds up with unexpected surprises and finally culminates in Bond totally outwitting the bad guy. I need to feel impressed by Bond. But this movie was a third about Bond, a third about M and a third about the villain. And was the villain really a villain? I didn't think so. I rooted for the villain towards the end of the movie. I felt all three were supporting characters that complimented each other and in the end I couldn't figure out if Bond was the 'hero' of the movie. This is not like any of the Bond movies ever made. It totally stepped away from the Bond formula and presented itself as an action drama. Yes I enjoyed the movie but I missed Bond and the theme music.",7,0,2,11 February 2013
Pulp Fiction," Can you find the cliché?
","This is not a review of the amazing movie called Pulp Fiction. Just an opinion of a part of the story line. If you want to read a review to make a decision wheather to watch the movie of not, please do not read any further, just go watch the movie. It will be totally worth your time. You may end up watching it more than once. And then come back and read the following.No one has seen movies like Reservoir Dogs before Quentin Tarantino became a director. Just like no one saw any E.T.s before Steven Spielberg became a film maker. Yes, Quentin Tarantino has got class when making movies. Pulp fiction is a great movie, a movie every film and media professor would recommend his or her students to watch and write a review for. But have you ever felt this movie has clichés? When we see Pulp fiction, we feel impressed that QT has cast a black man as the mob 'big' boss. We feel impressed when white people are shown as his henchmen which we never get to see in many Hollywood movies. But think... wasn't the mob 'big' boss black because he had to get raped. Penetrated from the rear by a white man. Would the movie's reviews or QT's reputation have changed if it was the other way round. A white mob boss being raped by a black cop? Isn't Tarantino submitting to what the majority audience want to see than maybe presenting his own point of view? Or does he really feel what he showed?",8,1,3,22 February 2006
