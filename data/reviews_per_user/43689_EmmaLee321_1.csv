Antz," I personally wouldn't recommend it at all.
","This movie has some nice animation, but the overall plot and the main characters ruined it for me. From the very beginning the main character was a drag. He was constantly complaining and saying that he was different and acting selfishly. I tried to like guy, but he only thought about himself until the very end of the movie. The other characters were pretty one-dimensional. There was also some sexual remarks such as Z saying that the princess would no longer be a part of his 'erotic fantasies.' Little things like that made the movie feel dirty. The plot was predictable within the first 5 minutes. You can give it a try and form your own opinion, but I personally don't recommend this movie.",4,0,2,24 July 2016
