The Avengers," OK for fans of this genre; dull for everybody else
","I've noticed that most of these super-heroes battling super-villain films get very high viewer scores on IMDB--8.0 or above. Clearly, many people love this kind of movie. I don't. My thoughts:
I saw this on a plane several years ago. I've seen several others in the genre. In this film--they all seem to be like this--the heroes are battling to save the world. Sometimes, they battle to save the galaxy, or even the universe. In this film, the plot setup is so ridiculous, I can't take any of it even halfway seriously. But the genre fans are pleased, because it delivers the one supreme thing they care most about: beings with super-powers fighting each other. Much of this very over-long movie consists of characters battling, flying around, running around, more fighting, etc., etc. My reaction: giant yawn! What a bore! See, before these kinds of movies--say, before Star Wars, as a point of reference--most movies were not focused on battle scenes, explosions, fate of worlds, etc. They were about characters and human (not alien, etc.) beings. Action scenes, even in action films, did not take up most of the screen time. Now there have been so many of these films, they all seem alike. It's way beyond saturation. So, if you are entertained by lots of fighting using special effects, you may well like this. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",3,1,2,6 July 2019
Mission: Impossible," A bad plot twist sinks this movie; a travesty for MI series fans
","Spoiler alert: As others who are very negative on this film have noted, the premise is all wrong for those of us who liked the original Mission: Impossible TV series. In the series, Jim Phelps, portrayed by Peter Graves, was a modest, dedicated, humane, brave, intelligent agent working to defeat wrongdoers, foreign and domestic. A number of times, he made choices that nearly cost him his life to complete his team's mission. He was liked and respected by his fellow team members. He was, and is, one of the great American TV heroes. There was no 'dark side to Jim Phelps. A fine man and a top agent.But in this movie, (BIG SPOILER!) Jim Phelps is--wait for it--the bad guy! This plot turn instantly makes this movie a giant stinker for fans of the original TV series. I would much rather watch a classic MI episode on DVD any day, than waste time on this. Twenty years from now, when this bad movie is forgotten, people will still be watching the great Jim Phelps, a timeless American hero.",1,8,10,3 July 2017
