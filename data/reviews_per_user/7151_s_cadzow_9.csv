Walk the Line," Phoenix and Witherspoon are Untouchable!
","I find it very hard to find how anyone could come up with a reason to not like Walk the Line. James Mangold's biopic of American country music legend Johnny Cash is what the biography genre is all about, and certainly the credit that Cash deserves. Everything about WtL comes together with such heart and determination, that my wife and I were left in our seats saying 'Wow, this is what going to the theatre is all about, what a fantastic movie!' Walk the Line starts us off with young Johnny Cash growing up on his parent's Arkansas cotton farm. Under constant fire from his father's criticism for not being as good as his brother, Johnny spends his nights listening to his radio, particularly the young country sweetheart June Carter. Johnny and his brother shared a very close bond, with his brother always helping him shrug off his father's drunken humiliations. When his brother dies after a freak accident, Johnny's drunken father naturally blames him saying, 'God took the wrong son!' Having nothing left but a never-ending determination to please his father, Johnny heads off to join the service, where he will learn to play the guitar.Years later we catch up with Johnny Cash, now portrayed with uncanny perfection by Joaquin Phoenix, as he is about to leave the service. James Mangold's transition from the young Cash to Phoenix is beautiful. There is no wasted time of promiscuous growth, as we are streamlined through Cash's first guitar, the birth of Folsom Prison Blues, to Cash's first gospel band, who Cash's wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) disapproves of with no secrecy to Johnny. With his door-to-door job going nowhere, Johnny decides its time for him and his band to put out a record. As Sun Records producer Sam Phillips politely turns down the bands gospel, Cash's last hope for his dream is his solo work, Folsom Prison Blues, and Phillips loves it.This is Joaquin's most pivotal scene. Can he make it as Cash or are we as an audience walking the line out of the theatre? He nails it. Not only does he nail it, he IS Johnny Cash. You close your eyes and you hear the razor sharp voice of Johnny Cash cut right through you and you would swear that there is no way that Joaquin Phoenix did his own vocals, which he does, and does flawlessly.As Cash's success leads him to touring, Mangold gives a nice touch to the supporting cast as we are introduced to the young Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and June Carter, who is played to absolute perfection by Reese Witherspoon. While we don't see a lot of the others like Elvis and Lewis, their presence is a lot of fun. Mangold holds steady in keeping a good close eye on the main point of WtL, which is the ever-blossoming fight for love between Johnny and June through Cash's addiction to alcohol and pills and his failing fight to make amends with his father.As far as Phoenix and Witherspoon go on screen, you couldn't find better chemistry in a science class. These two, pure and simple, are dynamite. The struggle of love and friendship that they portray between Johnny and June is harrowing. As Cash's marriage with his wife slowly deteriorates from his time on the road and devotion to June, June tries to keep Cash at arms length. Reese doesn't portray Carter as a home wrecker, yet she is incredibly sincere in her devotion as a friend to Johnny in his period of drug and alcohol abuse. After several denied proposals of marriage to June, Cash's plausible perseverance climaxes, which is factually correct, with a full house on stage proposal The performances given by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are as good as you can ever hope to get in a biopic. They are both phenomenal. With both performing their own vocals, Joaquin learned how to play all of Cash's songs on guitar, while Reese learned to play the Carter's songs on the auto-harp. The dedication that these two stars put into their roles is clearly reflected in the scenes of them on stage, they are just mind-blowing. When these two look into each other's eyes while on stage you want to explode with delight, they are just that good While WtL does not demonstrate Oscar worthy direction or camera work, it is not to say they are not up to par. James Mangold knew how to tackle this film, and I agree with his approach. A simple straightforward look and such an involved story that would take care of itself. WtL is a serious contender in this years Oscar race for obvious reasons. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are so dead on in their performances, and have set standards so high, that any actor taking on a biopic role will have great expectations to live up to. Walk the Line is a story that is so successful and so fulfilling, you wont want the closing credits to ever come. Johnny Cash and June Carter can rest assured with such a triumphant telling of their love living on",9,0,0,23 January 2006
Hostel," Failure in All Apects.
","After viewing Hostel it was clear that the film serves only two purposes: to act as a template for how a film should never, everÂ… ever be made, and as a confirmation that Cabin Fever was not just a fluke, Eli Roth is indeed THAT bad of a writer and THAT bad of a director. For a man who uses the words 'Bad' and 'Ghettoized' to describe the condition of the horror genre today, Roth seems to be doing overtime to make sure it stays that way.Hostel follows two American backpackers (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) and their drifter friend, as they waste the first hour of the film, which is only 1:35, stumbling across Europe doing drugs, trying to get laid, cracking jokes your little brother would think were funny and more or else making it impossible for us as an audience to care anything for them as characters. After the 'plot' decides to get moving we see that the travelers of Slovakia are starting to go missing, and we find out that the girls our American protagonists have been busy ogling over are in fact dealers of sorts to sadistic businessmen. And wouldn't you know it, they happen to pay top dollar for American subjects.Hostel makes me wonder what Eli Roth is really trying to accomplish. There is not a single moments worth of innovation in the films entirety. Is Roth trying to become synonymous with awfulness? Is he trying to give Uwe Boll a fight for the worst director in cinema history? If you take each aspect of Hostel and compare it to the worst movie you can think of, I'm almost certain you will find Hostel is just as bad, if not worse.First, the acting. This is the only true horrifying part of the film. You may not end up seeing the whole film if you're anything like me, because I spent most of its duration hanging my head in pure disbelief that any director would send his actors to the silver screen in such disgrace. Hernandez, who may not be an A-List actor but surely not a bad one, is sent to a sadly stupefied level. It is impossible for Hostel to work as a film because of the characters. From the very first few minutes I couldn't care at all what happened to these stoners, hell, I was actually waiting to see them tortured. We are not given any developing or background information on our protagonists, especially our 'hero' Hernandez. Point being, there's no point of relation between us and them and certainly no reason for us to care at all what happens to them.And then we have the dialogue. Oh good God the dialogue. If this were a silent picture or even if the dialogue consisted of only 'Fagg*t, Drugs, F*ck, Sex' then the film would have gotten itself across all the same, because there isn't a single line of important exposition in the entire barrage of triteness. That coupled with countless scenes that are entirely null and void, and you have not a single plausible aspect of Hostel. Well, I'll actually give Roth credit that the idea of Hostel itself is intriguing, but as I've stated above, he made sure we forgot about that.As far as the torture scenes are concerned, which I can only imagine are the reason people decided to venture to the theatres to see Hostel; they are too little too late. What is hyped up to be one of the most disturbing films of our time adds up to nothing more than some quick cuts and a dangling eyeball. I must admit I was extremely let down, for I was hoping to be satisfied with at least once part of the film. The scenes were not long enough to create tension and edited so poorly that what we did end up seeing, we actually didn't really get to see. With this being the second monumental disappointment coming from Eli Roth, it is beyond safe to say that this man is incapable of delivering the goods. On par with the horrendous efforts of Cabin Fever, I cannot recommend Hostel to anyone. It does not work as a horror piece, it does not work as an entertainment piece and it certainly does not work as anything that we should remember. Few films are less desirable than Hostel.",1,0,1,5 May 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Has it's Flaws, but Still A Lot of Fun.
","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the tale of 4 children in London who get sent to live with a professor in the London countryside to avoid the bombings of World War II. There the youngest, Lucy, finds a magical wardrobe that is the entrance to another world called Narnia, a vast landscape of eternal winter placed under a spell by the evil White Witch (who is portrayed marvelously by Tilda Swinton.) Her siblings, Peter, Edmund, and Susan all do not believe her, until one day they all find themselves tumbling through the wardrobe themselves. Once in Narnia, the White Witch, who is the self-proclaimed ruler, tempts Edmund to betray his siblings in exchange for goodies. As the other 3 try to find Edmund, they come to find that as children of Eve, they are the ones who will fulfill the prophecy of Narnia and bring end to the 100-year winter.Narnia: tLtWatW, like many other series of books set to film, feels a lot like a demo to something much larger. Much like the Harry Potter series with The Sorcerers Stone, this film works more like something that is setting the solid foundation for the Narnia's yet to come. The film has a very surreal and intriguing feel, yet it lacks in a lot of critical areas, such as acting and development.The cast of Narnia is almost entirely made up of unknowns and that works both for and against it. With the obvious sequels due out, we now have a lot more time to know and love the 4 Pevensie children. However, their time in tLtWatW is obviously spent getting a feel for what is expected of them, and that isn't to say that makes their performances bad per say, just curiously lacking. The character development of Nanria is hurt primarily by the hurried pace of the film itself.From the very beginning the viewer doesn't care too much for the overly obnoxious Edmund, and the film never really gives Edmund time enough to make a second impression. Also, the advancement of courage displayed by Peter, while admirable and enjoyable to watch, unfolds in too short of a time without much reasoning. The roles of the children, with the exception of the always-lovable Lucy, just cant seem to keep up with the fast passed enchantment of Narnia.While the look of Narnia itself, at first glance is stunning and quietly beautiful, a closer look shows a much more static environment that leaves a lot of room for capitalizing on in the next installment. For pure enjoyment sake, Narnia looks great, and has a lot of nice touches, but to achieve the level of the aforementioned Harry Potter sets (who was also lacking in its first attempt) there is a large amount of static to be removed from the sets and a higher level of set to actor interaction that must be achieved.The good thing however, is that with the previously mentioned, none of them are particularly big enough details to take away too much from the overall look and feel of Narnia.It might sound like I am I being a bit hard on Narnia: tLtWatW, and I really don't mean to be. This film is a lot of fun and has a lot of enjoyable aspects. The creatures the children come across; the beavers, Mr. Tumnus, the Nanria equivalent of Santa Clause, a centaur, the frightening and magical White Witch and of course the great lion Aslan, are all beautifully done and are what really make Narnia so much fun.The special effects are another aspect of the film that deserve a lot of credit, they are done extremely well by sfx group WETA, and they are the backbone in bringing the world of Narnia to life. There is one particular scene where Edmund calls an archery air strike on the advancing enemy, an air strike that shows the magical transformation of arrows into phoenix, that is very much applause worthy.The only fault that I hold Narnia: tLtWatW inexcusable on is the uneven bridge between the literature and the film. The film adaptation of Narnia leaves a lot to the minds of those who have not read C.S. Lewis's novel. When Lucy first enters Narnia she encounters Mr. Tumnus not 15 feet from the wardrobe entrance, which is in no way secretly hidden from the inhabitants of Narnia. If the land of Narnia is under the curse of eternal winter, why don't the Narnians just leave? Is it because they are forbidden to go through the wardrobe? It can't be because they don't know about it, with 4 children just passing through it and all. And why is there a war waging in Narnia, what happened there? It's the obvious questions like these that director's just cant chose not to answer on the assumption of everyone already knowing the story.All in all, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a film, if not taken too seriously, can be a lot of fun for everyone watching. While the film lacks in a few areas it has more than enough in its favour to make it worth your time. There are not many films today that can be honestly enjoyed by the whole family, and Narnia is one of those films. Narnia: tLtWatW left a lot of room for advancement, and with other obvious future Narnia films yet to come, we can expect fantastic things from this series.",7,0,0,24 January 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Best Film of 2005
","Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain is an extremely powerful and moving film. While Ang Lee's level of direction is now commonly known to go hand in hand with excellence, the level that Lee is on with Brokeback Mountain is something that few films in history have ever achieved. Despite a limited release and a hesitant reception in the box office, Brokeback Mountain is a film that will not let its raw power be denied by unwilling critics.Based on the short story by E. Annie Proulx, Brokeback Mountain is the heart-wrenching tale of two cowboys, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), who meet one summer while working together as cattle hands on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. While their co-worker relationship starts off awkward and standoffish, Jack's outgoing charm finally finds its way through Ennis's quiet and rough defenses, exposing two men unsure with the directions of their lives. The only thing that Ennis Del Mar knows, is that once he gets off Brokeback, he and his fiancÃƒÂ© Alma (Michelle Williams) are getting married and starting a family. Through the loneliness and cold nights spent on Brokeback, Jack and Ennis, to their own surprise, stumble across a love interest between them that will change their lives forever.Now, for a film that's subject matter alone for one reason or another causes some of America to cringe, you can imagine the delivery of such intense roles would be an incredible task, and that is exactly what we get in Brokeback Mountain, absolutely incredible performances. Every scene between Ledger and Gyllenhaal is electrifying. There are multiple instances while watching the exchanges between the two that I realized I had literally stopped breathing from their performances. After their first night making love, Jack and Ennis share a quiet scene on a hillside where Ennis says, 'You know I ain't queer,' then near the films end, while the two are talking about how hard it is to see each other so little, Ennis chokes out through his tears 'Well, why don't you? Why don't you just let me be? It's because of you that I'm like this! I ain't got nothing... I ain't nowhere... Get the f**k off me! I can't stand being like this no more, Jack!' Now you think about the contrast in those two crucial lines, and imagine the development that Ledger and Gyllenhaal go through during the film, and it is undeniable that the two of them are at their absolute best.To only talk about the men of Brokeback would be unfair, Michelle Williams who plays Alma, Ennis's wife, and Anne Hathaway who plays Lureen, Jack's wife, also deliver dynamic performances. The composure and character that these two wives have to maintain through the years, knowing that Alma is aware of the affair and clued in that Lureen has a quiet suspicion, is numbing. There is a very intense scene where Jack pays a visit to Ennis's apartment, and while the two are ravishing each other behind the stairwell we watch as Alma sees them through the front door. From that scene on, the relationship between Ledger and Williams in the film is like a ticking bomb, a bomb that the audience has no idea when it is going to explode.To separate a great movie from a good movie, you need everything, but most of all you need direction, and this is the strongest point of Brokeback Mountain. Ang Lee uses the vast scenery of Wyoming to accompany his actors in such an indescribable way, combined with the phenomenal camera work of Rodrigo Prieto, that it just keeps carving away at you with its beauty. Without many words spoken for the majority of the opening, Ang Lee's direction already has you hooked, it already has you interested, and it already has you committed. Every scene in Brokeback Mountain has a point, and every scene is used to further the plot. With so much beauty surrounding the already beautiful story, Brokeback can get extremely heavy on your heart.While the subject matter of Brokeback Mountain can at first be a shock to some, you have to remember at its heart, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, as sincere as they come. This is a film that exposes everything and holds nothing back. Everything in Brokeback Mountain is on it's A-game, the performances, especially the bare all performances given by Ledger and Gyllenhaal, the Oscar worthy direction of Ang Lee, and the jaw dropping cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto. While I'm sure you've heard it a thousand times before about thousands of other movies, but if you see just one movie this year, see Brokeback Mountain.",10,15,17,20 January 2006
Silent Hill," Good Film... Visual Marvel.
","As we all well know by now, horror is an all but dead genre. To achieve anything with 'Horror' being associated hand and hand with your film, you have to be crafty, you have to be original. Understanding that Silent Hill is first a drama, then a thriller/horror, it is a film that pulls of a very successful balance.Christophe Gan's Silent Hill is the film adaptation of the widely popular four parted video game series of the same name. A young girl, Sharon, has spells of sleepwalking, which always end in cries of a place called Silent Hill. Sharon's mother Rose, played by Radha Mitchell decides that taking Sharon to this place called Silent Hill might make her problems go away. However, what she finds in the cut off ghost town of Silent Hill is a life or death fight to find her daughter who has gone missing in the thick fog of ashes that constantly rain down there. By overcoming her fears, Rose slowly begins to uncover the dark secrets that lay buried deep beneath the city, the secrets that are ultimately linked to her daughter. The plot is straightforward enough, a story of a mother fighting to save her daughter, yet is heightened by many factors.To start, there are very few films, especially in the horror genre that can match the consistency of the cinematography in Silent Hill. This is where, along with other details that amateur viewers reviews fail to deliver a complete view on Silent Hill. Whether you liked it, hated it, or did not care one way or another for it, it is impossible to ignore what Silent Hill achieves visually and artistically, because it is in fact a visual marvel. As ironic as it may sound, the grotesqueness and Gothic-esquire of the settings illuminate an incredible beauty that is consistent throughout Silent Hill. Gan's did a phenomenal job with the falling ash to create an unsettling and eerie yet captivating aura around Silent Hill With it being known the use of CGI was scarcely used in the film, I am amazed more people are not talking about the seriousness of Silent Hill taking an Oscar for best Costumes/Set Design. The creatures of the film are phenomenal. I can honestly say that in no film have I ever seen such imaginative and horrifying creatures done so convincingly. For fans of this genre, the gore and slayings, oddly as it sounds, are highly rewarding, sophisticated and yes, appalling.Also on par with the aesthetics of Silent Hill is the expert cinematography and editing of the film. Return Gan's cinematographer Dan Laustsen and editor SÃ©bastien PrangÃ¨re, whose work can be seen in Brotherhood of the Wolf, display a very disciplined and controlled level of suspense and horror in Silent Hill. A great example of how well these two play of each other is a scene where a crucified corpse, serrated in barbed wire, becomes reanimated, chasing Rose. While Laustsen horrifically catches fragments of the creatures face, lashing tongue and tearing skin, PrangÃ¨re keeps the horror alive by taking these fragments and throwing them in a frantic order against Rose's desperate escape.Another aspect of Silent Hill that deserves applause is the sound. The soundtrack and sound editing are both highly attractive and effective in point. On several instances Silent Hill takes the audio and plays on the interaction of characters with the environment; Rose's hearing temporarily distorted with her body slamming to floor. The film's soundtrack by Akira Yamaoka, who did the original soundtracks for the Silent Hill series as well, returns to create the most modernly fitting horror style soundtrack to date; it is a gorgeous arrangement.While I was impressed with so much in Silent Hill, there were certainly aspects that I found to be less than impressive. The most obvious is what seems to plague all video game based films, and that is the excessive trite dialogue. While it did not prevail so much in Silent Hill, as lets say, Resident Evil, there were still enough lines to make you feel embarrassed. I have noticed that the source of the bad dialogue in this genre of films almost always stems from one source: the overly aggressive female sidekick. And you can bet that Silent Hill has one of those in the form of a pesky butch cop who ends up helping Rose find Sharon.What I find most people complaining about is that Silent Hill either has no plot or that the plot is too hard to follow, both of which I try to see, but simply cant. The plot is classic and ever present. I saw this film with people who have never played the series before (I have) and none confessed to being lost in the plot or feeling that they were left out by not have played the games, and I would agree. What furthers my confusion on peoples Silent Hill confusion is the films take on the riskiest form of exposition at the films conclusion. It is an absolute form of clarity that if done wrong can completely ruin and discredit a film. However, Silent Hill takes a very unique approach on a technique that few films would touch.There are also a few occurrences that at first glance you would write off as insignificant to put in the film or just simply unexplained, but Christophe Gan displayed enough control and direction to let those who take a second look know that there is another story here, that these things fell how they fell for a reason, and that reason is no doubt with the success that Silent Hill is receiving, a sequel. With the conclusion that Gan's chose for Silent Hill, it is obvious that everything that has to be said was not said in this installment.",8,1,3,23 April 2006
Crash," 2005's Biggest Disappointment.
","Crash is a film that is trying much too hard to try and show a part of society that is already painfully obvious. Stop and think... you are in the middle of a public place and someone shouts 'HEY! RACISM EXISTS! AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO A THING ABOUT IT!' Now imagine how you would feel? What is such an exclamation worth if there is no resolve offered with it? Crash is a collection, for the most part, of absurdly shallow stories with overly clichÃ©d characters. With the exception of the moving performance delivered by Michael Pena, the acting is significantly flawed and irritating. Most importantly, is the complete lack of depth and progression of the majority of the cast. The words 'cliche' and 'redundant' can not be used enough to describe the racial representations in Crash. The White's (Bullock, Dillon, and Fraser) are incredibly dull, phobic, uneducated and stereotypically shown as the 'we are the dominant race,' because of course Crash would not be much of a movie without a 'bad guy.' Next, we have the African Americans, which is an almost embarrassing and degrading representation. We have a 'social intellect' who as he steals cars, continues on his 'the white man is keeping the black man down' rants. The blacks also have the over the edge 'black pride' role of Thandie Newton. While breaking the law and then crying a string of 'this is because i'm black' proclamations, you can't help but wonder WHY this character was put in this movie, did Paul Haggis WANT us to dislike the blacks in Crash? The thing i can't understand the most about Crash, is the acclaim that Terrence Howard received for his role. After the blatant ignorance of his wife Newton's character, Howard makes a split from her and carries on the majority of the film conflicted about himself as a man, an African American and a husband. This was the only shot Crash really had at character development, and it failed. Newton's character evolves NONE from start to finish in Crash, and Terrence's character, with whatever revelation he quietly achieves in his own mind, is never shared with the audience, thus making his return to Newton at the end a total waste of whatever change we thought he was building up to. Another huge disappointment of Crash was the complete irrelevance of the supporting cast (Cheadle, Esposito, Phillippe). There is not a scene involving these characters that furthers the story or enhances the film in any way without just adding to the ever accumulating pile of redundancy. If the complete failure of character structure and advancing plot is not enough to be making you want to hit the stop button, then perhaps the complete lack of innovative camera work is. From the opening scene to the closing credits, Crash fails to deliver anything innovative to film, technique, or the ever pressing battle on racism. Do we as a society have a serious problem with racism? Yes. Are we as a society aware of this? Yes. Do we need a film that presents no resolution nor challenges the idea of racism to try and drive the point home? Most certainly not. I was thoroughly irritated and disappointed with this film.",3,22,34,10 January 2006
Capote," Hoffman's Brilliant Retribution.
","Bennett Miller's sophomore film, Capote, is best described as a silent killer riding atop the shoulders of a giant. That giant is Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film itself is fluent in objective and prolifically entertaining, making for a very steady film, with an unbeatable trump card.Capote focuses on the life of famous author Truman Capote, from 1959 Â– mid 1960's as he travels to Halcomb, Kansas to write an article about a brutally murdered family. When he, and good friend (and sidekick for the film) Harper Lee arrive, what they find is something much more engrossing, something that changes Truman Capote for the rest of his life, and end in the best work he will ever write, In Cold Blood.Bennet Miller does not spend much time outside of Capote's obsession with his research for his novel, and that goes much appreciated. Focusing on the strong bond that Capote forms with one of the murderers, Perry Smith, we get to see who the real Truman Capote is. The basis of their entire relationship, which drives the film, is a kind of catch 22. Does Truman really come to ever care enough to want Perry alive, or is it Capote's selfishness to complete his novel, and more so, does Truman himself even know? The library of mannerisms unique to Truman Capote is brought to light in some fashionably played and surprisingly humorous scenes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is unshakable in his interpretation. He executes an all eyes on me performance, which caricaturizes the real Capote's ability to entertain a crowd flawlessly.Truman always had a way of being the life of a party, by talking about nothing but himself and his work, yet with no one catching onto the egocentricity of it all, and this is the highlight of Hoffman's brilliant performance. There is a scene in Capote where Truman is at a party after spending months researching in Kansas, wooing the crowd with tales of the convicts and the murders. He goes on to exclaim that 'This is the book that I was born to write,' turning to the woman next to him and asking 'So what have you been up to?' letting out a hearty sarcastic laugh as if to say 'Well it doesn't compare to me or my work, so what does it matter?' Next to never do you get the chance to see an actor immersed so completely in a role as Philip Seymour Hoffman is as Truman Capote.The only minor problem I had with Capote, as a whole was the almost depreciated expectations that Bennett Miller placed before Hoffman. I felt that Miller limited Hoffman to a commonly linear formula, and despite Hoffman's brilliance, he couldn't break free far enough for what I really wanted to see. This role was Hoffman's ascension to a level that most actors will never reach, and while his performance will be talked about by film classes for decades to come, it is clearly obvious that Phillip Seymour Hoffman wasn't done, he was consumed, and he was more than able to take on more of Truman Capote.I adored Capote from start to finish, absolutely adored it. For those of you, like me, who have been watching Hoffman through Magnolia and Love Liza, there is no better retribution for Hoffman than the acclaim he has received for his role as Truman Capote. With a new level of fame surrounding Hoffman and up and coming director Bennett Miller, I can only hope we see a pairing of these two talents again in the near future. As far as Capote goes, it is without question a film to be added to the must see lists of everyone in the interest of educated cinema.",9,2,3,27 March 2006
AmÃ©lie," the film of my life!
","(a.k.a - Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain) Nominated for 5 Academy Awards, Amelie is the visually and emotionally intense story of the painfully shy Amelie Poulain. Raised by 2 left of center parents, Amelie was left with only her imagination to get her through her childhood, an imagination that cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel brings to life nostalgically. Years later, after finding a past tenants treasure, Amelie decides to become a regular do gooder. However, we wonder if she will ever have the time to please herself, and if she will ever be able to tell the love of her life how she feels. Through a series of comical and heartwrenching trials, Amelie sets the wheels of fate in motion. This is a film, that when you think back about it, you cant help but smile. This is a film that will touch you emotionally, it will make you laugh, cry, and most importantly; think about the fundamentals of life. Visually, this movie is breathtaking. Acting wise, the characters are so well executed, and the characters are so real, that is impossible for you not to relate to them on some level. And if this film could not get any better, Yann Tiersen delivers an original score so beautifully composed and matched to the imagery, that it will give you chills time and time again.",10,3,8,8 January 2006
V for Vendetta," Absolutely Outstanding!
","James McTeigue's V for Vendetta is the film adaptation of Alan Moore's darkly riveting graphic novel. While falling in season with the plethora of book to film adaptations, V also brings some heavy and controversial topics with it, making it a breeding ground for critics at every angle.The storyline for V is thick and a lot more intelligent than most action movies to date, especially those in the comic to film genre. While this seems to be working for and against the film in some cases, V for Vendetta is an extremely fun thrill ride with a very sophisticated level of intelligence and politics to keep things on edge.In V for Vendetta we follow the charismatic and cultural masked avenger who goes only by the name 'V.' Dressed in complete black, and donning a Guy Fawkes mask, we are told little of V's past, except that at the rise of the totalitarian government in Great Britain, he was part of a monstrous government controlled virus experiment. As the governments power grows more and more out of hand, our shadowy hero rises to take a stand for himself and the people of Britain, he sets out to make sure those responsible are held accountable for their actions.Our first outing with V shows him coming to the rescue of a young lady named Evey, as she is in danger of being raped by Britain's secret police. From that point on, their fates become intertwined, now that the government officials suspect Evey of being in league with the now considered terrorist V. As V launches his rally for the people of Britain, Evey is caught in between hiding from the government and whether or not answer V's call.With V's trials bringing out the more powerful inner Evey, and the people of Great Britain becoming more and more weary of their leaders, we follow a pair of detectives as they try and bring V down. However, as they uncover more and more about the truth, they find that maybe it isn't V that they should be going after.The mood of V for Vendetta comes across beautifully. Evey street corner is dark, cold. A perfect reflection of how we are lead to believe V feels inside. The score is astoundingly accurate for the picture that V paints, leaving you simply enthralled with its intensity. As for a protagonist who wears a mask for the films entirety, Hugo Weaving couldn't haven been more convincing. With every tilt and nod of his head, we know what he's thinking, feeling, the vengeance and the love.What I liked most about V for Vendetta is that from start to finish it never backs down once. Whether it is the ever-stylish Wachowski influenced cinematography, or the bold call to action set forth by V, this film remains solid in all convictions. With all the ways that the script for V could have turned out to be, the trivial delicacies were handled well by McTeigue, such as never revealing our heroes face to the audience.V for Vendetta is a film that is very much heightened with being seen on the big screen, and a film that I feel very much deserves to be seen as such. V is a tactful culmination of art, style, wit, freedom, politics, love, liberation, and exceptional film-making. While it is obvious how the political plot can be a turn off for some, there is so much more to be taken from V than whatever American political parallels critics are trying to imprison the film with. I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this film.",9,2,5,21 March 2006
