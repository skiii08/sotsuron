The Avengers," Very Good
","I do not follow the Marvel comic empire's characters all that much but I really enjoyed this movie. It seemed a little over the top until I remembered it is all nothing but movie make believe. The stealth cloaked, VTOL air ship was kind of cool and the special effects were, what can I say, special. I was a little put off with the Samuel Jackson portrayal of Nick Fury. His character was cold, standoffish, and a using, manipulative boss. The manipulation he used to bring the Avengers together with the death of the nerd was necessary but theatrical. Of course it would work because it was in the script:) :) The over all acting was very good if basic. I tend to think we see a large part of the real Robert Downey Jr. in his role of Ironman. While he is a gifted actor when he tries I do think he is a bit of an egomaniac and the Stark character fits him well.",9,0,3,30 March 2013
Underworld," Entertaining
","Not a bad take on the human, vampire, lycan genre. There a some questions that I have though. If the lycan's prey on human's wouldn't there be so many going missing that the human's would notice, even if it was the runaways, the homeless, or those in the boondocks? If only the oldest werewolves can transform at will what do the younger ones eat when they are not in werewolf form? What do the vampire's feed on if not human blood, animal's, blood banks? This does not seem to be answered in this film. Selene is a death dealer among the vampires and goes after any lycan she can. Lucien is the first of the lycan's and is still alive even though he was supposedly killed 600 years ago by a vampire named Kraven. Kraven is just like his name. He entered a deal with Lucien to save himself. Selene figures all this out and raises Viktor, an elder, from hibernation to help her. It turns out that Viktor is the one who killed her entire family centuries ago and turned her. Selene has been led to believe it was the lycan's who did it, therefore her hate for the lycans. She learns of this from Kraven this info leads ends up killing Viktor. Along the way it is discovered that a human descendant (Michael) of the founder of both the vampire and the werewolf lines is alive. He gets bitten by a werewolf and then by a vampire. This would normally kill a human but because of his heritage he survives as a hybrid. Selene has been protecting him from all comers and squirrels him away in semi-hidden places. So at the end of the movie Selene and Michael are safe, at least temporarily, A lot of the bad guys are dead, and only one of the three elders are left, Marcus the son of the founder. Oh yeah, Amelia is the third elder from Europe but she has been killed by the lycans. So there is a really nice set up for the sequel.",7,2,3,11 January 2014
The Fifth Element," Very well done!!!
","This movie rocks!! The acting is good if campy. There is a great mixture of action and comedy. I was really impressed by Milla Jovovich, who think is one hot woman!! The quirks and tics she used for her character were excellent plus I found out the fake language she used was one she and the director made up between them and actually used it to write letters to each other! The fight scenes are funny as heck and well done. ! Gary Oldman does a great bad guy. Chris Tucker is fabulous as a very flamboyant radio personality. Of course Bruce Willis is Bruce Willis. This movie also features some character actors that usually get bad guy roles as good guys, the President and the general are two.",8,4,7,11 January 2013
Blade," Good stuff
","I now own all four of the Blade movies. The three with Snipes are extremely entertaining. He seems to actually know some katana moves (his sword type from the samurai of Japan) or at least someone in the movie did. The leather clothes and the cape are a little over the top but what the heck. Of course the bad guys are really bad and the good guys are almost as bad but only to the those that deserve it, the vampires and the familiars. Kris Kristopherson is great as Whistler. Daniel Logue is way to nuts to be taken seriously which is a shame because I like him. IMDb requires way too many lines as far as I am concerned. A pithy to the point review can be left with fewer that 10 lines of comment.",8,0,1,19 March 2013
The Mummy," One funny movie
","This movie rocks. Brendan Frazier plays a former, probably AWOL, Foreign Legionnaire who stumbled across the famous but until now unknown, city of Hamunaptra. This occurs when his character and a real weasel of a legionnaire are fighting what turns out to be not bandits but the guardians of the city and its secrets. Frazier's character, Rick, hooks up with a rather clutsy but extremely knowledgeable person in Evy. She has a very good knowledge ancient Egypt and reads some their languages. She saves Rick just as he is about to be hung by buying he out from the greedy prison warden. The scenes on the paddle wheeler are interesting and sets up what is too come. The American adventurers are of course killed along the was as the mummy is pieced back to a body. Patricia Velasquel does a very good job as the reincarnated Anch Su Namun. She plays a stone cold bitch until towards the end when she shows her true colors and runs.",9,2,2,6 July 2013
Sleepy Hollow," Entertaining
","A different take on the Sleepy Hollow tale. This one takes place only twenty years after the Hessian scum has been killed and buried. He has returned and is slaughtering people right and left. Johnny Depp plays the forward thinking constable sent up from the big city to solve the cases. He teams up with the son of one of the killed men since he is the only one who has the courage (or stupidity) to assist the constable. As things progress Depp goes to what I guess is a with. She does a conjuration using bats blood and gets a prosaic quote. Riding on he comes across Christina Ricci, the mayor's daughter, in the woods. They team up and find the death tree. Here is where the heads are stuffed into it and Depp surmises that the horseman is reaping heads until his is returned. Casper Van Dien actually gets a decent role in this movie, it seems he usually gets the B movie action roles. There are some dream sequences that fill in some back story Depp's character. Also Ricci appears to be a witch of some sort as she brews a potion to help Depp recover from the Horseman's attack. After seeing a family tree Depp finally figures out what the connection is between the murders and the horseman. He finds out that it is a conspiracy between the four town elders to ensure the passing down of a large fortune to the right person. The real question is who is the one that stole the horseman's skull, that is who is controlling it to do his bidding. Turns out it is the stepmother who is using the horseman to exact revenge for her family's displacement from their farm. Anyway Depp, Ricci and the boy climb to the top of a windmill which goes up in an explosion of flames with the horseman inside. Since the horseman was already dead he survives and chases after the escaping trio. Of course he catches them and there is a fight scene. Coming across his skull at the end the horseman ends up taking the stepmother as his bride? and the rst is film history.s",7,0,0,16 February 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Pretty entertaining
","Interesting variation on the old fairy tale. Offspring of a grand good witch and a human Hansel and Gretel are grown ups now and hunt witches for money. They end up returning to their home town. It is under attack by witches stealing the 12 children that are needed for a grand blood moon rite that would make witches immune to fire. The witches also need the heart of a grand white witch which just happens to reside in Gretel. The weapons they dreamed up for this movie were very interesting, from repeating crossbows, rifles (I guess), to a machine gun at the end. Hansel hooks up with a white witch and she is very instrumental in eventually wiping out all the witches that have come from all over the world to be in the rite. Alas she dies. The troll, Edward, is saved by Gretel and helps free the children, kill some witches, and generally help out. He then joins the witch slaying gang after all the attending witches have been eliminated as they continue to hunt the surviving witches. Some humor, a lot of gore, a nice pool scene, all in all watchable.",7,0,1,28 December 2013
Tropic Thunder," What the ???
","With this cast I expected so much more from this film. I guess it can be blamed on the writing and the direction but I am not so sure. It is not that good and not that funny. Shooting a war film that goes way over budget some one gets the bright idea to move the film site to the real jungle. There they run into real bad guys, drug dealing bandits. They are lead by a kid which I find very hard to believe, especially in Asian society. Stiller is captured by the bandits and thinking it is part of the movie tries to play it so. He is recognized from a previous role and is spared from further torture. The remaining cast of not heroes find him and attacks the site with weapons that are loaded with blanks. Fortunately the explosive expert and her not really a Vietnam war veteran show up, rig some charges, and save the day. I will not watch this movie again.",4,5,8,18 April 2014
Resident Evil," Very good
","First I think most zombie movies made today are stupid. While this is considered a zombie movie it does differ in one respect, you know what is causing it and it is not just some made up plot line. I think Milla Jovovich is super hot. In this movie she plays a human that been turned into an almost perfect killer because of her training and the virus that has been unleashed by the corporation. The corporation sends an assault team to investigate and they end up dead. Milla gets reawakened and starts to do her thing. She does it very well and wipes out several of the zombie like creatures in the underground lair. It turns out that Milla was a security specialist who was infected and then placed in suspension. Gee it turns out she has some kind of immune response to the virus. She survives and it takes off from there. I really enjoyed this movie",9,1,2,3 August 2013
Twilight," So so
","Okay, I do not understand the following that this series gets. It is very slow to develop film, Kristen Stewart is so so as an actress and attractiveness. The whole movie revolves around her attraction to Edward who turns out to be a vampire. Fangless, no reflection in a mirror, and can survive in sunlight. Not the typical vampire scenarios. Turns out Edwards 'family' are vampire vegans. They suck blood from animals and not humans. Of course there are those that don't and the Cullen's fight them. Some of the local Indians turn out to be werewolves. They only hunt vampires and not humans but only when they break the treaty. Definitely not the stereotypical werewolf lore. I do like the dad sheriff, he does his role extremely well. There are family under currents that are interesting. Watchable one time but no more than that.",5,0,2,3 February 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Entertaining
","A very funny and campy horror flick. Poor old Tucker and Dale are just two good ole boys trying to fix up Tucker's very run down vacation home up in the Appalachian Mountain. Now where a broke hillbilly got the money not only to buy a shack but to get all the power equipment is never covered. Some college kids show up to camp out and things start to go very wrong. Through a series of mishaps, accidents, and a nut case student, several of the kids die through no fault of T and D. Turns out that the nut case has major mental issues due to his folks getting attacked 20 years ago at the same spot. After several dead kids the sheriff shows and of course gets killed. The nut case gets the revolver and starts shooting. I believe I counted 12 shots, another Hollywood weapon!! Without giving too much more away the last third of the movie is pretty hilarious, at least to me. I highly recommend this film to those who like camp and horror with humor.",9,0,0,27 January 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Very good
","Not quite as good as the first one only because several of the first movie cast was not in it. Sam Neill, Laura Dern are two that come to mind. This is still an excellent movie. Jeff Golblum is back as Doctor Ian Malcolm and does his usual good job. His character is still insightful and more importantly he still gets some humorous lines as well. Julianne Moore plays a very tunnel vision doctor that is more interested in the animals than in her own survival, at least at times. One of the not so good guys that are also on this island if the hunter played by Pete Postlethwaite. He is there for the protection but his personal objective is to bag a big one. Well it turns out he gets bagged.",8,69,86,7 July 2013
2012," Okay at best
","I guess this is based on the Mayan calender thing. You know, the one that didn't happen. The CGI is pretty good. I wonder how many narrow, almost but not quite gotcha escapes can one believe might happen? I have a big problem with the plot of this film. They sell tickets to the rich to finance the arks, the huge vessels (?) intended to save a remnant of humanity by riding out the enormous tsunamis that will occur. The world is ending, who cares about money, print all you need, who will bring you to task? If you are serious about saving humanity you want the best, brightest, young, fertile people you can find plus some experienced crew and scientists, not the old and rich or powerful. Then there is the scene with helicopters carrying elephants, plus the on board one showing several live animals. Why? Use frozen ova and sperm. You can store a lot more species as well as higher numbers of each type thereby allowing more humans on board. John Cusack does okay in the lead role and saves everyone on board his ark at the last second. Again to many close calls to be believable. After things settle down the surviving humans end up going to Africa to start over, where we began. Entertaining yes but not close to reality.",5,1,3,6 January 2014
The Longest Day," A good one
","This is pretty historically accurate which I really appreciate since so many movies take way too many liberties with the truth. This movie has soooooo many big time old stars that it is not even funny. All of them do a great job in their roles. The writing is excellent and so is the acting. Some of the roles showed stuff that I later found out was real, such as Henry Fonda as General Roosevelt and the debilitating arthritis he had yet still went ashore. Red Buttons as the paratrooper stuck oh the side of a building while his company of paratroopers were pretty much cut to ribbons by the Krauts. John Wayne as the colonel with the broken ankle who kept on pushing forward however he could. The landings on the beaches that killed so many but went forward anyway. This movie shows the fortitude of the U.S. and Allied troops to get the job done. If these landings had been thrown back who knows how long the war would have gone on. Not to mention what it would have done to Allied moral.",10,2,4,7 May 2013
Major League," So funny
","This movie is in the vein of Hot Shots but it is in baseball. Tom Berenger is great as the aging catcher who dreams of at least one for good year, which he gets. Tom is a team leader and a guide for the younger players. This team is put together to lose on purpose by the bitch who owns the team played nicely by Margaret Whitton. They get an old minor league washed up James Gammon to run the team expecting him to run it in to the ground. He doesn't do that but uses the fact that he owner wants them to fail as the motivation for the teams success. Charlie Sheen is good as the penal league pitcher Wild Thing. Wesley Snipes is fine as the over eager, wanna be power hitter, who must learn to hit it on the ground and steal bases. Rene Russo plays Berenger's exe and is decent in her role but not great.",9,0,1,27 July 2013
The Mummy Returns," Decent enough
",Not as well done as The Mummy but I still really liked it. Rick and Evy are now married with a child. They are living in London in a very nice house. The fight scenes when the bad guys break into the house are very well done. Their kid is taken during the fight. The kid is a major player in this movie. He is smart enough to leave clues for his parents who are following him. The graphics in this movie are just as good as in the first one. I love the little pygmy guardians that wake up when all the people invade the area. They are inspired and funny. The Scorpion King scenes are not even close to the movie that came later. That movie is a good one though.,8,1,1,6 July 2013
The Descent," Come on!!!
","Give me a break!!!!!! A viable population of blind, humanoid, underground dwelling, carnivorous creatures that can leave their the cave system to hunt at night and there are no legends, no rumors, no sightings by local people??? How do the creatures maintain a population with no new blood, captured people from above ground, (yeah the can be incredibly inbred but that would mean their extinction in time)?? Again with no local comments or legends?? This movie had a three star rating from Fear.net so I taped it hoping for a decent horror flick. Boy was I wrong!!! This is not that good a movie to deserve three stars. I would give it 1.5 stars at most.",4,2,7,11 July 2012
Jack Reacher," Fairly well done
","Okay I do not care for Tom Cruise as a person but he is a pretty good actor when he gets a good script. While this one is far fetched he does a good job especially in the choreographed fight scenes plus the other action ones. The whole premise is a bit of a stretched in my opinion but what the heck. It is an entertaining movie even if it is unrealistic. Of course the main baddies are Russian who knows what. The end where Jack attacks the bad guy is a little trite but again who cares, if they are are bad guys in the movies they deserve what is coming to them, right?? It is too bad that the black detective turns out to be a bad guy but all good things come to an end, huh? The Russian controller is a real butt head and I love the end. Robert Duvall is great as the old marine back up for Reacher.",7,1,2,19 August 2014
30 Days of Night," Oh come on
","This was first pitched as a COMEDY!!! Just another gore for the sake of gore vampire movie in my opinion. I sure miss the old vampire movies where at least some of it is left to the viewers mind and the gore is not done just for its own sake. Any way the town of Barrow, Alaska is isolated by vampires as it is about to go through the polar night of thirty days. Hence the title me thinks. So after almost all the townspeople are slaughtered by the blood suckers the sheriff accidentally finds out they can be killed by chopping the head off. They also figure out that a sun lamp works. I did not see any one try the old religious standbys of holy water, cross, bible, etc. The few remaining townies are picked off one by one by circumstances and the vamps. In the end the vampires are burning the whole town so there will be no survivors to tell people they really exist. To try and save the few remaining humans which includes is estranged wife the sheriff turns him self, goes out to the vampires and fights the leader. Killing it by driving his hand through its head. The remaining ones trudge of into the dark set, the sheriff greets the returning sun with his wife. Of course he fries. I guess they let the other vampires go hoping for a sequel. I hope not.",4,0,4,26 August 2014
Dark Shadows," Not funny at all
","Billed as a comedy it doesn't even come close to being funny in my opinion. I watched it, hoping it would actually make me laugh. Wrong answer!!! I mean Johnny Depp does his usually nice job as Barnabas but he just doesn't play the role in a funny manner. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the later day matriarch of the Collins clan but she excepts Barnabas's rebirth(?) a little too readily even with the reported family history. I just did not find it humorous at all. Things do pick up when Angelique shows up. She is the witch that originally cursed Barnabas as a vampire. She is still alive after close to 200 years and recognizes Barnabas when he is resurrected when his coffin is found by an excavating team and they open it. All eleven workers are killed to feed the thirst. Depp uses his vampire powers to bring the Collins clan back to prominence. Helen Bonham Carter is a live in shrink at the Collins mansion and discovers the secret when she hypnotizes Barnabas and he spills all. Trying to win the reborn Victoria he looks for new ways to be interesting. I don't know I just stopped after a little over an hour of watching this not funny move. It wasn't even campy.",2,1,2,29 June 2014
1408," Not bad at all
","I like John Cusack. He usually plays an understated role and excels at it. In this movie he is an atheistic man who has no believe in anything supernatural and has written several books on the subjects. UNTIL he checks into room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. Samuel L. Jackson is the Dolphin Hotel manager and does everything in his power to keep Cusack out of room 1408. To no avail of course. Turns out there have been over fifty deaths in the room, from natural ones (?) to suicides. The hotel will no longer rent the room out until Cusack shows up. In this room Cusack finally meets his truth, well at least in this movie. He tries to escape through the duct system and runs into a couple of nightmares. He gets dumped back into the room but continues to see things. Flashbacks appear to show that Cusack was married and had a little girl with some disease. When this daughter apparently dies it seems to be what lead him to lose his faith in God. This seems to be the cause of all his writings. Towards the end of the film he is really hallucinating, the pictures on the walls not only come alive but gets dragged into a sea scene. Any way this is an entertaining show. Fopr the very end Watch It.",8,0,1,1 March 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Darn good
","Jennifer Lawerence is not only a good actress but is hot in an understated way. In the sequel to 'Hunger Games'Donald Sutherland, President Snow,a damn fine bad guy, is president of of some entity called PanAm. He manipulates the next selection and all victors are chosen so he can get the rebellion rally point killed. The rally point is of course Katniss, Jennifer's character. As before it starts out with 24 contestants, several not only band together but some of them opt to protect Katniss. They have bought in to the rebellion. Woody Harrelson plays a past victor who is now a mentor plus the games master and a couple of players are in on a conspiracy to help the rebellion. Snow showing his true evil has Katniss's district wiped out. Shouldn't have done that I think. I hate the ending as it leaves so much up in the air. Gee do I see another movie?????",9,1,15,20 August 2014
The Proposal," Funny but a little sappy
","I like Sandra Bullock a lot. I also like Ryan Reynolds quite a bit. This movie starts with Bullock's character as a real ball buster. Then of course the plot unfolds and she must marry to stay in the US and continue to pursue her career. When the two must go to Alaska for Gammie's (Betty White)birthday and she discovers Ryan comes from wealth, she is very surprised since he never mentioned it in three years. As the movie develops you can see the two of them start to be attracted to each other. Love will win out in the end I guess. Craig T. Nelson is great as the father, Betty White seems to never have a bad role. The dance scene between Betty White and Sandra Bullock is priceless. When Gammie has the fake heart attack and brings father and son together it is precious. All in all true love wins in the end, which is what is to be expected in a romance.",8,0,1,24 September 2012
Jurassic Park," Great stuff
","I could not to own this movie. I think it can not get any better for a movie of this genre. The casting is excellent. There is humor along with the terror and horror that is encountered by the humans. The computer generated images are so life like and their mobility is very smooth, not jerky or blurry like in some movies. Jeff Goldblum is extremely good and funny in his role as the chaos proponent Dr. Ian Malcolm. Sam Neill is great as the older dinosaur specialist and Laura Dern is a good back up. I actually like the Jurassic Park movies a lot better than Spielberg's Star Wars stuff. I have watched the Jurassic movies several times and the Star Wars series I don't even own.",10,4,5,7 July 2013
