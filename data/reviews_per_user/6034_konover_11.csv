Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Where to begin?
","There's no denying this film failed to meet most people's expectations, including my own. Sitting in the theater, I had a lump in my throat as the 20th Century Fox theme lashed out and the saga's classic intro and thunderous John Williams score shook the theater. Everyone was excited. The first doubts hit me not even a five minutes into the film. As soon as I saw that alien, Nute Gunray, I thought, 'Oh, no.'This had been a family occasion. I was stupid enough to 'camp' overnight for the tickets. At first, I thought it would be like a Star Wars Woodstock. Hey, I'm a classic Gen X'r who was made to feel that I missed out on all the fun in the late 60s and 70s, stupid me. But I'm a quick learner and the feelings of brotherhood among the seemingly cool guys and girls I met were soon replaced by dog-eat-dog-desperation as the time to buy the tickets came closer. I nearly came to blows with a guy who accused me of cutting in line. It took several hours for me to realize that this whole idea of camping was ludicrous. Going to the theater at midnight and still standing in line at 3 p.m. in Miami weather, was an act of utter lunacy. I was dying to take a shower, get something to eat and go home. The only reason I stayed for the tickets was because I didn't want to have gone through all that crap to come home with no tickets, which was the only reason I went there to begin with.
Anyway, come opening day, my mom and dad, who were my age when the original Star Wars came out, came with me along with my sister, brother and several close friends. When it was all over, no one said a word and we all sort of looked at each other. Nobody wanted to be the first to say the movie, (a Star Wars movie no less)...kinda sucked. 'It was about as good as [Return of the] Jedi,' my friend said, trying to trick himself into thinking the movie wasn't that bad. And we all slinked out of the theater and into our cars as if we'd come out of a funeral.I still think the movie's strengths lie in Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor's performances. Natalie Portman's performance shifted between good and fair. Jake Lloyd would've come across better if they'd chopped his lines in half. The scene where he's shooting those villainous robots in the fighter looks, ridiculously, like he's playing video games.I actually think the notorious Jar Jar Binks, clearly not the most embraced character, had the potential to be liked. Still, he was given WAY too much screen time and dialogue. All of his freaking out moments early on nearly sink the entire picture. You would think too much Jar Jar and not enough Darth Maul would sound like a recipe for disaster. It was also disappointing to see Terence Stamp as 'Chancellor Valorum' wasted in a frivolous role that amounted to nothing.Some aspects of the film were handled perfectly, however: R2-D2 is cleverly utilized throughout the picture. He's the constant reminder that this was a Star Wars movie despite Luke, Han and Leia's abscence. R2 meets C3PO was a great moment. Jabba's cameo. The lightsaber battle was superb as was the 'Duel of the Fates' score by John Williams. The epilogue of the film was also excellent, but it was all too late.The scenes on Tatoinne took forever. The outcome of the pod race was too predictable to devote as much screen time to it as they did. The space battle was not spectacular and felt like a carbon copy of the previous Star Wars battles. The fight between the Gungans and the Federation Droids was solid plot-wise, though visually spectacular.Still, a few years have gone by. And as I look back, I still think the movie could've certainly used an edit, especially where Jar Jar and Anakin's dialogue are concerned. My feeling, then as now, is that the movie will eventually grow on people a bit once the trilogy is complete. To say the movie sucked is a bit unfair. Like pizza, there's no such thing as bad Star Wars though this one certainly lacked the overall mystique and sense of wonder  of the originals. I've matured and already I look back at this film with a twang of nostalgia, for the build-up more than anything. It was just nice to believe, for a little while, that Star Wars was back again.",8,0,1,7 December 2002
Ali," Mediocre
","As you might know, the movie covers Ali's prime years between 1964-1974. As a huge Muhammad Ali, I HATE to say it, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Maybe it's because I know so much about Ali's best years that I found myself bored to tears. Will Smith did a good job, especially when he was playing an angry Ali. But comically, Smith just made me want to see the real Ali. I found it telling of how unique Ali really is when a really funny guy like Smith is unable to capture the spontaneous comedy of the real Ali. Still, Smith gave a good performance as Ali. Jon Voight did a great job as Howard Cosell. And Mario Van Peebles, who has become synonymous with bad films in some circles, did a good job portraying Malcolm X. Jamie Foxx also did a funny Bundini Brown, although I don't think he really captured the eccentric personality that was the real Bundini. I saw the film with one of my best friends and he summed up the film best: 'It's a Cliff's Notes on Ali's best years.' They also briefly touched upon what made Ali tick, but didn't really follow through. I thought it was cool that the film explored Ali's relationship with Malcolm X. The fight scenes were well-done. There were a lot of little details that I thought were mistakes albeit unimportant to the story that only a hardcore boxing fanatic would know. Ali has to be one of the most if not THE most heavily documented sports figures of all time, and this portion of his life happens to be extremely well documented. This is probably why the movie, especially the fight scenes, bored me. I've seen the real fights, the real footage, and the real story as told in countless documentaries. I think the film tried to recreate the magic already told by countless documentaries and that's why it failed. It just didn't seem real. Somebody said that the reason Ali wasn't garnering major boxoffice was because the subject matter wasn't that attractive anymore. I disagree with that vehemently. Let me put it this way, I, as a HUGE Ali fan, almost didn't see this. The word of mouth wasn't good and I was turned off by the fact that it only covered Ali's best years. Don't get me wrong though. I sympathize with the film makers because I think this was an incredibly ambitious movie. Anyone trying to tell Ali's story has got a lot of guts. Ali has been in the spotlight since the early 60s and his story is an epic one. And his life deals with more than just a great boxing career. So I do give those involved high marks for their courage in undertaking this task because even I wouldn't want the job of making an Ali movie. But unfortunately, this doesn't change my opinion that the movie is poorly paced and ultimately somewhat boring.I would probably only recommend the film to those who aren't too familiar with Ali. I would suggest the Academy Award winning documentary 'When We Were Kings' which gives you the complete rundown of Ali's historic fight with George Foreman.Here's my critique summary: Good acting, lousy movie.",Null,0,0,8 January 2002
Coffee and Cigarettes," An uneven combination of wet paint and amusing conversation
","I like Independent movies. I like Jim Jarmusch. I really like that cast. And I really do enjoy coffee and cigarettes. So imagine my disappointment when I saw Steven Wright and Roberto Benigni struggling to improvise dialgoue in what was, amazingly, Jarmusch's choice for the opening act.I took an acting class about 5 years ago, and this is exactly what the people in my class were doing. Improvising dialogue about nothing. And it shows. I cringed when I saw Wright and Roberto try to humor us by changing seats. This is why I went to acting class, so I wouldn't look this inept on the stage or on film.With two or three exceptions, the rest of the vignettes in this 90-minute-or-so film are like watching paint dry.I was particularly looking forward to Bill Murray's bit, but there wasn't very much for him to work with. Even a talented woman like Cate Blanchett can't do anything with her scene. It's overlong and loses interest a few minutes in.Only two vignettes were worth watching: Iggy Pop and Tom Waits; and the best of the bunch: Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan. Molina runs away with the movie, (if it can even called that since it's basically a cadre of unrelated skits stringed together).I think the idea for this film was a good one. But unfortunately, the conversation pieces in the skits are boring, consisting mostly of actors staring at each other while smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee and desperately trying to think of something meaningful or funny to say.At one point, two men with French accents are having coffee and one is trying to extract information from the other. 'What's wrong?' man #2 asked. 'Nothing is wrong,' replies man #1. And they go on like this for something like 10 minutes. You can tell Jarmusch didn't give any other direction except to tell man #2, 'Try to find out what's wrong.' and then tell man #1, 'Don't tell him what's wrong. No matter what.' These are like lessons in Acting 101.It's more like a student film than something you should pay $20 or so to buy on DVD. If you rent it, I suggest watching the Iggy-Waits scene and the Molina-Coogan scene. Sure, give the movie a shot, but if you get up in arms, look for Iggy and Molina. If I had a DVD burner, I'd grab those two skits to keep. I highly advise against a blind purchase.",Null,5,10,19 October 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good, but overrated
","Many here gone into depth about the similarities and differences between the book and the movie. I have not read the book, but I have seen the movie. Simply put, the Fellowship of the Ring is easily one of the most overrated films in recent times.The movie has a lot going for it. Excellent actors delivering excellent performances. Mind-blowing production values, special effects, sets, music and locations. Yet, despite all of the film's virtues, the movie somehow still managed to bore me. It also seemed that there were too many 'endings' that made the experience seem all the more long and tedious.
I remember watching this in the theater and thinking the ending was near when Frodo is stabbed. I checked my watch, saw only an hour had passed and concluded it was wishful thinking. The beginning of the movie lead me to believe I was in for a memorable movie-going experience. Certainly, it was a majestic and beautiful movie to look at. There's a lot going on up on the screen, yet I couldn't bring myself to care about what was on the screen. I was also at a loss at how a good friend of mine was able to see this in the theaters 7 times! I barely made it through my first. The nomination for Best Picture was a serious miscalculation.As for the story, I was disappointed that for a movie that has wizards as central characters, we get very little magic. All we see is Gandalf light a few fire works, scare the crap out of Bilbo, lamely fight with Christopher Lee and scare off a big ass dragon with little panache. I hate to compare, but I think I'm being factual when I say that you can find more fascinating wizardry in any given Star Wars installment or in the Harry Potter films.
Still, the movie had some wonderful moments. Ian McKellan, John Rhys-Davis and Christopher Lee are all fun to watch. In fact, the entire cast is first-rate. The scenes in the dungeons with all the special effects and swordplay were exciting and fun, and it was here that I thought the movie's pace would skyrocket, but that was not completely the case. It's the only movie that I can think of where virtually everything is perfect, except the pacing. Unfortunately, pacing counts for a lot.Despite the drawbacks, I still find myself occasionally revisiting Middle-Earth. Perhaps the movie grows on you? Hopefully, it will, but when a movie of this magnitude fails to grab me instantly the way Star Wars, Harry Potter, the Godfather and a lot of the great films did, something is wrong.",1,1,5,30 November 2002
Spider-Man," Best super-hero movie since Superman II
","Spiderman is the best super-hero film since 1980's Superman II. A lot of people here compare Spiderman to the Batman movies, but in actuality, Spiderman is very close in tone to Superman II and the second-half of Superman: The Movie, (although Superman II BADLY needs a special edition since it looks a bit aged). In fact, it seems to me that Sam Raimi (allegedly a fan of the Superman movies) gave a nod to Superman when he had Peter Parker running, and opening his shirt to reveal the Spiderman costume, which Reeve did in the opening moments of Superman II and in his first 'transition' in Superman: The Movie.My only complaints about the movie was that the special effects were,  at times, somewhat unconvincing and the musical score lacked the majesty of the Superman and Batman themes. However, the creators of the films were able to emphasize their energy on equally, if not, more important details.I agree entirely with film critics who said Raimi and the writers were able to find the right dosage of action, drama, sympathy and humor in the story. And the result is a satisfying movie with good performances to match and mostly very good special effects to culminate with one of the best films to be based on a mainstream action-oriented character.Tobey McGuire is to Spiderman what Christopher Reeve was to Superman. McGuire BECAME Spiderman. His transformation from a picked-on teenager to superhero was wonderful acting, and I'll be looking forward to his next outing as the wall-crawler. Willem DaFoe was outstanding, as usual. I'd rank his crazed-interpretation of the Green Goblin to be up there with Jack Nicholson's The Joker. There are no lame performances in the film. Kirsten Dunst, although some say she didn't have a lot to work with, was wonderful as Mary Jane. Contrary to critics who preferred the second half of the film, I was more intrigued with Peter's growth and relationship with Mary Jane than when he engaged the Green Goblin in obligatory battle. Don't get me wrong, I also enjoyed the action, but we all know what super-hero movies are predictably about: good vs. evil. What makes them special and what sets some comic/action films apart from others are the characterizations between the kicking ass. It's the stuff that the very best super-hero films are made of: Superman I, Superman II, Batman Returns, X-Men and Spiderman are all examples of comic films that delivered the action, but also had interesting character relationships in between to bring us closer to the characters we like.No doubt the iconoclastic film buffs will come out of the woodwork in droves and look for any reason to bash Spiderman, but make no mistake. If you're even a casual fan of characters like Spiderman and don't get too caught up in the hype, you should be in for a great time.",10,0,0,8 May 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Entertaining action
","This was a good, solid piece of entertaining action. By now, you know the advice: Don't go in expecting The Godfather. You have to go in with a 'This is an action movie.' mindset.My only complaint about the movie is that I felt some things were left unresolved, and while, yes, it's only an action film, I do feel that no movie should leave things unresolved. By the end of the film, I didn't really know where the lead character stood with his bosses in the police force or with his would be girlfriend. Having said that, the action scenes are tightly done. Good action, good soundtrack, good pacing. And I highly recommend it if you're in the mood for an action film.",Null,1,1,27 January 2002
Ocean's Eleven," You know, I don't get it.
","Ocean's 11 isn't a bad movie. It's just too familiar. Caper movies are caper movies, but Ocean's 11 acts like it's covering new ground when it isn't. I caught this movie at a dollar theater and I thought: Soderbergh? Clooney? Roberts? Pitt? Garcia? Gould? Cheadle? Damon? How could I go wrong?
What follows is an extremely predictable series of events that I saw coming way before I was supposed to. For example, as soon as we find out Clooney used to be married to Julia Roberts and is now seeing Andy Garcia, we can easily see what will unfold an hour and change later. The Clooney-Roberts relationship is an unconvincing, tired cliche, and it takes the whole movie to show us the predictable results.As soon as Clooney discusses his extravagant and unlikely plot, we know he's going to get away with it. And when the twist arrives, you just shrug and say ok. Soderbergh is one of my favorite directors and while he occasionally brings up the occasional vibrant scene, he can't get past what is easily one of the most predictable capers in recent times. Just about everything in the movie telegraphs its punches. I also saw Heist and The Score, but those movies had dynamic dialogue, dynamic relationships, dynamic performances and enough verisimilitude to draw you into the caper and leave you wondering what the characters were going to get away with. The dynamic in Ocean's 11 is 'Look how cool we are.' There's very little danger. You never get the sense that the characters are real people and therefore we never really care about them. The only exception being Carl Reiner's Saul.Clooney and company are fun to watch for the most part, but the story is strictly by-the-numbers entertainment with Soderbergh only occasionally pausing to inject some welcome Soderbergh-like visuals.
All in all, it's not a total misfire, but it could've been trimmed and would've benefitted from an injection of humanity and originality. Highly recommended for people who haven't seen very many capers. Everyone else, don't expect the movie to blow you away.",5,9,15,16 November 2002
Titanic," Quite simply: Awesome
","As the movie prepared to open to audiences, I only had one objective. I wanted to see how James Cameron recreated the disastrous sinking like never before. There had been Titanic movies before, which were very good, but this was the first time technology would make the sinking look real and as accurate as possible. Cameron had tons of research and actual scientific knowledge available to him to tell the story and how it happened. We know now, for example, that the Titanic broke in two---a fact that was not yet known in the 1950s when two Titanic movies were released. My feeling on Cameron's movie was: I just want to see how he recreated the disaster.
What I found was a pleasant surprise. More than a special effects success, I was drawn in by the fictitious story of Jack and Rose. Iconoclast viewers brushed off the romantic story like a flake on a blue suit, but it struck me differently. I thought about the totality of the 1500 lives that Jack and Rose represented. I thought about how many couples that really loved each other, like Jack and Rose did, that perished in freezing waters. I thought about the terror that must have possessed so many as they waited to die in the freezing darkness.The movie was powerfully realized. And although there were no Oliviers or Brandos in the cast, the acting was realistic and solid enough to invoke empathy for all of the characters. It may not be the 'guy' thing to say, but I have to admit to choking a bit when Titanic angled, ready to sink to its destiny, and watching the hundreds of passengers desperately cling to their last moments as best as possible. Never have I seen a movie create despair so tangibly. I've always been a Titanic buff. I don't know why, but I know that, for me, Titanic's story always held a certain mystique and sense of awe . And this was years and years before Cameron's movie hit the big time. For me, the movie remains a moving, triumphant experience. I can't help but feel Cameron captured my perception of the Titanic mystique and put it on film for all to see. Let the magic sweep you away to a time and ship long gone...",Null,3,5,31 May 2003
The Godfather: Part III," Give me a break
","I'm tired of reading and hearing people bashing Godfather III. I don't consider it as good as the first two, which are both a 10+ on a scale from 1 to 10, making I & II a hard act to follow.Godfather III was a really good sequel. The acting was great if not solid all the way around. I only think Sofia Coppola was miscast and it would've been awesome to have Winona Ryder as planned. Andy Garcia did a really good job as Vincent. George Hamilton was solid as BJ Harrison, Tom Hagen's replacement.My problem with III is that it seems to much time has passed. I would've preferred a storyline, like part 1, that goes on for several years simply because the character of Michael seems to be Michael only in name. I would've preferred more of a transition from the 'evil' Michael in II to the one we see in III. I did enjoy that Michael was busting his butt trying to go legit because it was what he wanted in Part 1 and time was running out.Someone mentioned that it was hard to believe that Michael would leave the family in the hands of a hot-head like Vincent, which I can understand. However, I think they did a fairly decent job of showing scenes in which Michael was teaching Vincent the ropes. It also didn't help that Anthony, Michael's son, didn't want anything to do with the family business.
About the only thing that really bothered me about III is the lack of closure it gave the very important character of Tom Hagen. I missed Robert Duvall big time. All in all, I think III is a well-crafted sequel that is extremely good in its own right. Never mind that pretentious notion that true Godfather fans pretend III doesn't exist. If III is hard to watch, it's only because it's sad that there probably won't be more Godfather films coming and the film shows the characters we loved so much in the twilight of their years.",Null,0,1,9 January 2002
Vanilla Sky," Definitely worth watching
","The movie is definitely worth watching. I'm not sure why the movie has gotten such a love it/hate it reputation, but I definitely loved it. Tom Cruise is a great actor. I wish he'd do more of these dramatic kind of roles because he can definitely act. Cameron Diaz gives a great performance and steals the show from Penelope Cruz who gives a solid performance, but wasn't as impressive as Diaz. Jason Lee plays Jason Lee, which is always fun, but like Steve Buscemi's trade-mark witticism from the 90s, Lee's schtick is getting just a little tiresome, in my opinion. Kurt Russell, who I'm a big fan of, has a good supporting role in the film.There was a lot of eye candy as far as the visuals. I loved the scene at the club. I think Cruise did some of his best acting in this sequence. Rex Reed said there was some unintentional laughter in the film, but who was to say it's unintentional? I laughed at several points in the film, but that only made me enjoy it more. What he calls unintentional, I call 'dark comedy'. I also enjoyed the diverse soundtrack.I would recommend seeing the film on a big screen, but one thing about the film for those waiting to see it on video or DVD. This is a movie you got to sit down and pay attention to. If you're one of those people that likes to get up and do the dishes or fix the room or talk during the movie, you're NOT going to follow it AND thus you're probably not going to like it.",10,1,2,8 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The third is the best of all
","I was not a huge fan of Fellowship of the Ring when I first saw it. The Two Towers was an improvement, though I still could not figure out why so many people were putting these films on such a pedestal. Since then, the two films have grown on me and I was actually psyched to see Return of the King.It proved to be the best of the lot. The movie was long, but it didn't feel long. The action, characters and storylines are now more familiar to me than when I first saw Fellowship and Return of the King proved to be an entertaining and rewarding experience.The acting, as with the previous entries, is excellent. The dialogue is crisp. The special effects, mindblowing. And the storytelling, though sometimes confusing, is for the most part captivating.
Frodo's approach to the fiery pit of Mount Doom probably ranks as the trilogy's single best sequence.Much has been said about the movie's number of endings. I think they were appropriate and welcome groups of epilogues.Because a lot of the moviegoing public is on a Lord of the Rings high, not a whole lot is said about the trilogy's flaws. And just like in the previous entries, this film has its share.For one, there has been some talk about a homoerotic chemistry between Frodo and Sam in the previous films. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.  There were times where I thought Frodo and Sam were perfectly capable of planting a big wet one on each other's lips and declaring their love for one another. Imagine Han Solo stopping in the middle of the Death Star to proclaim his feelings for Luke Skywalker and you get the idea. Merry and Pippin have similar scenes. It was just too distracting. There's also a lot of crying in this film. But to the film's credit, Peter Jackson somehow makes it work.I was also disappointed there were not more scenes of wizardry and magic. A lot is said about how the Lord of the Rings trilogy blows away the Star Wars prequels with its use of special effects. I have to say that while that is true to a degree, some of what is up in Return of the King looks like CGI. Sometimes, though rarely, horribly so.Viggo Mortensen, for me, steals the show as Aragorn. He's kinda like the Lord of the Rings version of Han Solo, but more fleshed out. He's tough, cool and a lady's man, but there's room here for more human characteristics.
Ian McKellan's performance as Gandalf ranks right up there as well. The other characters, like Gimli and Leogalas, have become loveable and kind of like old friends. We're glad to see them and glad to see their competitive friendship in the heat of battle.Finally, I was really concerned when I heard that Christopher Lee's scenes were deleted. I still say that was a mistake, but it was not nearly as distracting as I thought it would be.This was a great, satisfying way to end the trilogy and, for once, the third film is the best film.",1,0,5,17 December 2003
