","Yes, I'm man enough to admit that his film scared the beegeezus out of me. It's great to see studios picking up original ideas for once instead of trying to woo us with the same old summer blockbummer.  The BWP, although it seemed to be an epic for a 87 minute movie, had all the elements that makes a horror film work.  The dark forest has been a fear of many dating back centuries ago, and seeing the characters fall into dementia was a classic outcome of being in those surroundings.  Many like to compare the frightening factor to SCREAM, but the BWP had one objective - to scare and disturb you beyond belief - and it did so better than the last American horror movie.  Go see it if you don't plan on going camping for a while;)",8,1,1,26 July 1999
