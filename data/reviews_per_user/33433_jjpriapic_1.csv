Hereditary," Good trailer, terrible movie
","This 'horror' film had too many unintentionally funny moments in it to be scary. And the back story, on which the plot depended, was terribly inadequate. That creates a lot of unnecessary confusion about who is doing what to whom and why they're doing it. Take the jarring sound effects and foreboding music out of this movie and it's a real blah.",2,4,9,15 June 2018
