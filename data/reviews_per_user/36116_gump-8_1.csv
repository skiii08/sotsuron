The Blair Witch Project," AWESOME...A hair raising experience!!!
",This is probably the best horror film to come out in a very long time. It was real. The most amazing thing is the lack of traditional horror elements. There was none of that. This film relied only on your psychological thought and perception to scare yourself. Truly a great film which is destined to become a classic.,10,1,2,3 August 1999
