Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 22 years makes a big difference
","Well, I'm sitting here watching the original movie in it's original state and I must say, 22 years of technology makes a big difference.  The movie story line was okay, but the special effects were so good, I had to give the movie a 10.  The sound effects were amazing, but a little loud.  Natalie Portman, as fine as she is, needs some acting lessons.  The monotone portrayal of the queen and her hand maiden reminds me of Carrie Fishers cheesey portrayal of Leah in the original.  Carrie, like Natalie, couldn't decide whether to use an english accent or an American accent.  So, she used both.  Also, the beginning of the movie with Liam and Co. slashing droids with their light sabres wore thin quickly.  Other than that, the movie was very entertaining.  This movie makes the 1977 original look very cheesey. Almost 'B' movie quality in terms of effects.  What will they come up with next?  WOW!",8,0,0,24 May 1999
Erin Brockovich," Julia is mean as a snake in this one
","Some one needs to change the title of this movie to 'Erin is a B****'.  It was a decent movie, but come on guys #233 of all time?  Give me a break. Her character was so nasty, you'd have to settle a 333 million dollar lawsuit just to put up with her dysfunctional grouchy butt.  Albert Finney was his usual great self.  Her lawsuit was a little silly too.  I have never heard of a personal injury lawsuit going to trial let alone mediation that fast.  I don't know any attorneys who would put up with an employee that unprofessional.",7,1,4,17 August 2000
Gladiator," AWESOME!
","The only thing lacking in this movie is slow motion in the battle scenes. That would have made it truely amazing.  The opening battle scene was the greatest.  Russell Crowe, YOU THE MAN!  And River Phoenix's brother was truely a weasel.  I had to see it twice just to get my fix....'Billy, do you like gladiator movies?'....LOL...Not until this one.",10,0,0,18 August 2000
