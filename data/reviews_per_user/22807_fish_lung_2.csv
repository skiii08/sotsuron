Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," IT'S A STAR WARS FILM!!!
","With AOTC just around the corner, I feel the need to respond to some of the comments I've seen posted here and give my take on Episode I. To all of you who claim this is the worst film ever, grow up!  It's not, and you know it's not.  Save your exaggerations for your tax forms.  To those who claim the film is a far cry from the great films of the original trilogy, or as was written more than once, 'not a Star Wars film', I ask you, what were you watching when you saw the original trilogy?  Have you watched A New Hope recently?  Just like Phantom Menace, ALL of the Star Wars films have lousy, choppy dialogue, a story that is difficult to follow, and often full of holes, borderline acting, and confusing editing.  I mean come on, even Sir Alec Guiness, a reknown Shakespearean actor couldn't pull off some of Lucas' ridiculous dialogue.But that's not why we see Star Wars movies!!! Going to a Star Wars movie expecting to see Oscar caliber production is like seeing Rugrats the Movie and expecting to be philosophically enlightened!  It's a special effects laden sci-fi film that excites us with lasers and starfighters and that eternal battle of good vs. evil.  More than anything IT JUST LOOKS COOL! That's what was so great about the first film, it blew us away with the visuals, not with the directing, or editing, or acting. Anyone who claims that Mark Hamill could act his way out of a box is a liar or an idiot!  And the visuals got better with each movie.  Phantom Menace, with it's incredible panoramas and dazzling fight sequences lifted it to even new levels.  Yes, Jar-Jar is lame, and yes the story is shotty, but what else is new.  And remember, these movies are PG.  They are designed for not just an adult audience, or even a teenage audience, but to include children as well.Bottom Line - take this and all Star Wars films for what they are, sci-fi adventure films... incredibly fun and entertaining sci-fi adventure films, not Oscar contenders.",Null,0,0,18 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great Adventure - Huge Step up From TPM
","Don't believe the self-important film critics and wannabe indy-film student reviewers, this is a very good film, but more importantly, it's a great time at the movies!  The visuals are incredible, the sets and backgrounds are breathtaking, the special effects are what we have come to expect, groundbreaking, and the battle scenes are unreal.  Seeing Yoda in action alone is worth seeing the film!  The dialogue and acting, while still typically Lucas-style choppy, are better than Phantom Menace, and Hayden Christenson is a force (excuse the pun) to be reckoned with in Hollywood. He delivers a great performance as a coming of age Jedi struggling with the inner demons that will eventually lead him to... well, we all know where he ends up.  But despite that foreknowledge, you're still captivated by him and the rollercoaster ride of his emotions. AOTC follows the same pattern that Lucas established with the first trilogy. While A New Hope, and subsequently Phantom Menace were bright, colorful films, which mainly introduce us to the essential characters and give a thin base story from which to launch the rest of the trilogy, Attack of the Clones in turn follows Empire Strikes Back step for step.  It is dark and brooding, like Empire, it has 2 separate plots which branch out, and then come back together, like Empire, and ends with a battle scene eerily similar to Empire's climax.  And in the same frustrating and wonderful way as Empire, Clones raises far more questions than it answers.Bottom Line - Citizen Kane it's not, but unlike Citizen Kane, it's the most ENTERTAINING 2 1/2 hours I've spent in the theater in a long time - AND THAT'S THE POINT OF A STAR WARS FILM!!!",10,0,0,17 May 2002
