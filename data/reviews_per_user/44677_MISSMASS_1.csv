Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Do Not watch this movie!
","This film picks up right where Volume 1 left off where the bride finds the other remaining assassins and Bill. Despite that the fact that the first one was so-so and highly enjoyable, once the second half came out and we saw it: It was better than the first one, NOT! Just when critics were rating this film with good reviews just like the first one they gave a bit of warning that it was changed from the drama/action to the almost full drama. They defiantly were right. For one thing this movie was way over hyped. When you see the first section of an entire title usually the second half or next fraction would get better as you progress through the sections but the second part Volume 2 was a real letdown man it just tanked. Take a look at the proper Kung Fu franchise Once Upon A Time In China Trilogy. The first part was an amazing Kung Fu film, which was long, and you had to sit through plot to get to the amazing action scenes just like in Kill Bill Volume 1. In part 2, the movie was shorter and the pace was quickened, and finally in part 3 it was complete non-stop action with very little plot. Now that's a proper Kung Fu franchise. When I see a sequel to a film I enjoyed. I like watching the story progress further down the road. The road, which always tries to be smooth, had some bumps on the road. Just when you got to the prologue part and Bill's (David Carradine) character comes up, his acting just bored everyone to death, I liked him in Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, but man his acting was terrible. It should be known as 'Boring Drama: The Legend should not continue'. If Darly Hannah's scene with the black mamba is the best part you have in this film, you are in serious trouble. Micheal Madsen & Daryl Hannah, they've had better days. This was supposed to be a proper Kung Fu movie just like the way Volume 1 was and the action in Volume 2 was way too empty. Even slow-paced films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidalgo and Peter Pan had more action than this entire film. Even the one fight scene with Daryl Hannah can't save this film. I rather would have watched Peter Pan than this deadly boredom. ACTION and GOOD PLOT: Non-existent GOOD ACTING EXCLUDING UMA THURMAN: Non-existentBottom Line: THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LETDOWNS IN Hollywood HISTORY! TRULY Overrated",5,3,8,1 February 2005
