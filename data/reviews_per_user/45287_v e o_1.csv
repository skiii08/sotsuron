Requiem for a Dream," *click* *pop* *fizz* *flash*
","My roommate walked into the room as the end credits were rolling on 'Requiem for a dream' and asked 'was that movie good?' .. I didn't know how to reply. It certainly was an entertaining technical film but I felt emotionally numb...as if someone had just died.  I wiped a single tear from my eye and quietly said 'yes.'It is not a nice, pleasant or 'enjoyable' film...instead it's mean, depressing and outright disturbing. It's a brutally honest portrayal of addiction and the confusing realm in which addicts live. It's emotional spectrum starts at 'slightly sad but kind of amusing' and ends with 'oh my god! what have they done!', hitting every note in between. It's final impact is similar to being slapped in the face.Watching the downward spiral of each lead character is like watching a car wreck in slow motion.. you are powerless to stop it yet are mesmerized at the same time. Each has the ability to change their fate, yet in an effort to capture their individual dreams, stay on the downward track.Some reviewers have compared this movie to Trainspotting. I have to disagree. Call me crazy, but I think trainspotting GLORIFIED heroin use...after watching that movie, my friends joked about going and getting some smack.. 'hey that looks fun!  HA HA!'  I highly doubt there would be similar jokes after viewing this movie.. It's so horribly, deadly, honestly serious.This movie is a real downer; there is nothing 'cool' about it other then terrific acting, style and direction. Not a fun movie by any means, I recommend it for serious viewers only.9/10",Null,0,1,3 May 2002
