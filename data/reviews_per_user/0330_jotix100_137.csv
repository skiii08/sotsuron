The Rock," Alcatraz
","'The Rock' is a film that borrowed from other movies. That said, director Michael Bay does a wonderful job in this action packed picture that has the viewer at the edge of his seat. Of course, a lot is asked from us in accepting things we know can only happen in the movies, but if we indulge the makers of 'The Rock', we will be rewarded to an almost two hours of pure, unadulterated thrills.The story at the center of the film involves a renegade Marine General who wants to have the government compensate those people that have given their lives for the country without being properly compensated. His way of doing this is to 'hijack' Alcatraz, the notorious former prison in San Francisco and stage his revenge from that strategic point. The only thing is, that in doing so, he and his men take hostage the unsuspecting tourists that have come to see the place.Meanwhile in Washington, all the powers that be, have to deal with the threat General Hummel presents. Someone remembers a man that has been imprisoned thirty years before for doing the unimaginable: he stole secrets from Edgar Hoover. That is how Mason, an Englishman, is asked to help the people that are trying to infiltrate Alcatraz, since he served there and escaped from it, and knows all its secrets.There is also a scientist who understands the chemical danger of the equipment that Hummel, and his men, stole illegally. Those missiles are now in place in Alcatraz and Dr. Stanley Goodspeed is commanded to get to San Francisco to help in the operation. Goodspeed, whose girlfriend had just told him he is going to be a father, has no way of getting out of the mission.Although one knows how everything is going to come out, there is not a dull moment in the movie. Director Bay stages with flair all the action, which involves the typical car chase in the streets of San Francisco. David Weisberg, Douglas Cook and Mark Rosner contributed to the screen treatment. The story defies all logic, but all the films of this genre are like this. John Scharzman's cinematography enhances the film and the action.The film works because of the chemistry between Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. They make an odd team, who are great together. Ed Harris is Gen. Hummel. His anger is real and he gives another vivid portrait of a man that is seeking justice, if even going beyond sanity to claim it. Other great actors in the film include, David Morse, John Spencer, William Forsythe, Claire Forlani and many others too numerous to mention.'The Rock' is entertaining and it is highly recommended even for a second viewing thanks to what Michael Bay did with the film.",8,7,10,6 September 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Don't mess around with The Bride
","Quentin Tarantino's conclusion of the 'Kill Bill' films is nothing short of brilliant. He makes it clear he is a master of this genre. In fact, this new film can stand on its own, as far as the story goes. It makes perfect sense in more ways than the first installment where there was more action, but perhaps the narrative is not as clear as in this one.Mr. Tarantino is greatly helped by his choice of Uma Thurman to play his heroine. As with the other film, Ms Thurman demonstrates she is up to the task of battling whatever enemies who dare come her way.The casting is excellent. David Carradine, Michael Parks, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, Bo Svenson, Gordon Liu, and the rest of the crew play well under the guidance of Quentin Tarantino. A satisfying time at the movies.",10,0,1,18 April 2004
The New World," Colonialism
","Terrence Malick is not a prolific director, as shown by his meager body of work for a man that has spent more than thirty years in the business with only five films to his credit. Yet, every picture he directs is received by his fans with open arms because Mr. Malick has clearly shown his films are a feast for the eyes.The director and his cinematographer the magnificent Emmanuel Lubezki, have created a work of art, a feast for one's eyes. Most of the frames of the movie can stand alone as a picture in a gallery, or a museum. Mr. Malick's work has always distinguished itself for imbuing beauty in everything he shows on the screen. In Mr. Lubezki, the director has found an invaluable collaborator indeed. Both men seem to be attuned into nature as they bring it to us in all its splendor.As far as the film, itself, it's a movie that will divide fans and detractors of Mr. Malick. Our only problem with the film seems to be with the sound quality of the finished product. Watching it in DVD format, the dialog seems to get lost and nuances go by without we being able to catch some of it.'The New World' represents a discovery by the English explorers of a new land, but it also is an event for the native people whose land, and their way of living will be supplanted by the powerful invaders who will dominate them because of the superiority of their arms. It is sad to realize the arriving white man had no use for the people they find in the new country.The acting in general is first rate. Colin Farrell, as Captain Smith, dominates the first part of the movie. His involvement with the Indian princess Pocahontas, who is never named in the film, shows some tender moments. Q'Orianka Kilcher makes a fine Pocahontas. Christian Bale makes a great appearance as the kind John Rolfe. Christopher Plummer and August Schellenberg are fine as Capt. Newport and Powhatan.Terrence Malick uses James Horner's musical score to blend with Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23, and Richard Wagner's 'Das Rheingold'. The music enhances the mood of the fine images in the film. Let's only hope Mr. Malick will not take too long for his new project, as he always makes us wait impatiently for his next picture.",8,5,10,2 October 2006
Howl's Moving Castle," Hayao Miyazaki casts his spell on us
","The genius of Anime films, Hayao Miyazaki, shows why he is one of an absolute masters of the genre. Taking Diana Wynne Jones' story 'Howl's Moving Castle' and creating the magnificent film for our delight, is something that no other man could have accomplished with as much flair and panache as Mr. Miyazaki has done.The film has such a great look that at times we wonder if one is really seeing an animated film, or not. The images we watch on the screen have such detailed and rich look that we wonder how did Mr. Miyasaki could have accomplished it.Not having seen the Japanese version, the English one that was released here offers great voices to go along with the many characters in the film. The big surprise was Jean Simmons, an actress we haven't see much lately who does a great job with the older Sophie. As the young Sophie, Emily Mortimes is wonderful and her voice suits the character so well. It was also a stroke of genius to have cast Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, as she seems to be having a great time acting her. Billy Crystal was delightful as Calcifer and Josh Hutcherson is perfect as Markl. Christian Bale is an amazing Howl. In minor roles we hear the voices of Blythe Danner, Crisping Freeman and Jena Malone, among others.This Anime film will delight young and old fans of Hayao Miyazaki who can look forward to a great time at the movies with this film.",10,19,29,2 July 2005
Walk the Line," Johnny Cash and June Carter a wonderful combination!
","The 1950s was an important period for the popular music that was being created in this country. It was the decade that brought forth the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, June Carter, Patsy Cline, Bob Dylan and the rest of those innovators that sent the popular music of that era to the stratosphere. The music was created by poor rural people that grew up hearing the blues and gospel music in church and at home. The white music stars stole shamelessly from the black artists they admired, but because of the racial climate in the land, they had no chance to make it as big as the white performers.Johnny Cash was an important figure that came out of that time. As portrayed in 'Walk the Line', the biographic picture created by its director, James Mangold, and his collaborator, Gill Dennis, they present us an aspect of the man as he was starting in the music business as he goes from poverty and tragedy, early in life, to become one of the most influential exponents of the music that came out of Memphis in the fifties.The film showcases Johnny Cash and his involvement with June Carter, a figure that was legendary in her own right, and through her family which was involved in music. The film shows a man who had the talent, the charisma and the good looks to make it big in the music world with his own material. The film concentrates in the life of Mr. Cash and Ms. Carter prior to their marriage as their lives interconnected with one another because they traveled in the same circuit and usually paired in a lot of those venues. Theirs was a relationship that started on a friendly basis until Johnny messes his life and his marriage to the patient Vivian because he falls in love with June. On the other hand, June didn't want to get involved with a married man and was battling her own demons.The best excuse for seeing the film is the terrific performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who, as Johnny and June, make this film come alive and make the viewer enter their world. Both actors do some of the best work in the movie. In fact, it was a surprise as how well these two dissimilar actors blend so well together, no mean feat for director Mangold.The film offers some of the best songs associated with Johnny Cash. The best part, and the wisest decision for the movie makers, was to let Mr. Phoenix sing the classic songs in his own way. Joaquin Phoenix, who has a good singing voice, also bears an uncanny resemblance with Mr. Cash. Reese Witherspoon makes a splash playing and singing songs that Ms. Carter made famous, although she was eclipsed by the stronger personality of Mr. Cash.The film will not disappoint thanks to the great treatment James Mangold gave the film.",8,17,31,15 December 2005
The Sound of Music," Salzburg!
","The only reason for watching again this 1965 musical was the new release of the Blu-Ray DVD. Having seen at a young age the wonderful Broadway production starring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel, the movie version that followed greatly enhanced a work, that in its own merit, didn't need any improvement. As directed by Robert Wise, right after his triumphant 'West Side Story', we were stunned to see how the director had opened up the film by placing the action just where it was supposed to have been taken place, the cinematic and gorgeous Salzburg.The new version we just saw is as splendid as when the film was originally released, but somehow in second viewing, we started to notice how sadly it has aged. Our first impression was much better than on second viewing because the original seemed larger than life. In fact, our copy of the film, even with the fine restoration cannot compare with the sensation of watching in a wide screen, which we believe was at the old Roxy where it played for quite a long time. Those were the days of exclusive engagements and this film qualified for it big time! Julie Andrews was at one of the highest points of her career, and as Maria her contribution to the overall enjoyment is invaluable. Christopher Plummer was an ideal Capt. Von Trapp. Eleanor Parker's Baroness has enough parts of charm and bitchiness seeing her man stolen by a novice in charge of those brats she would have inherited had she married the Captain.The real star of this production was Salzburg, that beautiful Austrian city that has kept its charm throughout history and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking. The film owes a lot to its cinematographer Ted McCourd who captured the magnificent locale in such a loving way. The music of Rogers and Hammerstein blends well within the context of the picture. It is a tribute to Robert Wise this film has endured the passing of time.",7,7,20,2 November 2009
50 First Dates," The fish doctor
","Not being an Adam Sandler fan, we avoided this film when it was released earlier last year. The premise sounded too much like 'Groundhog Day'. We took a chance the other night when it was shown on cable, and frankly, we found the movie entertaining. There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, 'Punch Drunk Love'.Drew Barrymore and Mr. Sandler had worked together before to surprisingly good results. They show an easy chemistry between them that serves the movie well. The idea of making Adam Sandler an aquarium doctor offers a lot of possibilities; his scenes with the walrus are hilarious.The supporting cast plays well together. A surprise was Rob Schneider, not one of my favorite actors, either, but in here, under the direction of Peter Segal, he delivers. Sean Astin, as the lisping brother on steroids is quite effective, as well as Blake Clark, as Lucy's father. Dan Aykroyd puts an appearance as the doctor who treats the young woman who has lost her long term memory.Watch it without any preconceptions, as probably it will surprise you.",7,63,89,2 January 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Witty con man.
","From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.Mr. Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer. He was a fast talker and a slick operator. He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies.
It's a welcome sight to have Mr. DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale, a man of many faces. He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty, the FBI agent that is in his trail. Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character. Of course, the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds, who are on his tail all the time.The minor roles are equally important. Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man, but he's too decent to do wrong; his business fails eventually. His marriage to Natalie Baye, the fine French actress, ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser.The action doesn't stop for one moment. This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr. Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out. Mr. Spielberg can thank the genial Mr. DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes.",10,158,176,24 January 2003
The Hangover," There's a tiger in the bathroom!
","As far as wedding movies go, 'The Hangover' is a tad different from others in the genre. We are not asked to follow the antics of these grown up men getting in all kinds of mischief, while trying to celebrate the ritual of a bachelor party in Las Vegas. As a matter of fact, the film spare us of all that, as the creators take us to watch the effects of the night in question as three of the four friends have to face the consequences of their night on the town. The American male shows signs of wanting to remain children for as long as they can. Phil, Stu, and Alan wanted to give their pal Doug a night he would not forget. Bringing him to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas was a sort of adventure for these foursome. When Doug, the groom to be, disappears after a night on the town, the remaining trio decide to retrace their steps to find him. Obviously, they have no clue as to where to begin. Alan discovers there is a tiger in the bathroom, as well as a baby hidden in an unexpected place. Stu finds, to his horror, he is missing a front tooth.As the friends try to put together the pieces about the disappearance of Doug, they get into more trouble, when a gang of thugs led by a gay Chinese man, begin to pressure them for eighty thousand dollars he claims Alan stole from him. Stu learns he got married at one of those ubiquitous chapels that dot Las Vegas. What's more, he has married a hooker, the mother of the child found in their suite. As for the tiger, it belongs to no other than Mike Tyson, a tough guy to deal with. Their erratic ways bring him to despair, but no Doug.Todd Phillips directed this entertaining comedy with sure hand. The screenplay by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, is not the by-the-number kind, although fans of the genre will find similarities with other movies about weddings that are disastrous. For starters, the creators have kept from the audience everything related to what really happened on the night of the bachelor party. We only see shots of what they really did in snapshots as the credits roll.Zach Galifianakis is turning into an impressive presence wherever he appears. We admired his work in the series 'Bored to Death'. He proves he is a funny man that does not mind 'baring' it all for a laugh. Bradley Cooper is the leader of the friends, but actually he is the straight man. Ed Helms, on the other hand, goes from the nerd type he is supposed to be into a new man, changed when he married the hooker. Rachael Harris, who plays Melissa, Stu's terrorizing lover, is an actress that has been around in small roles and really deserves to play more often. She excels as the henpecking Melissa, the woman that two-times Stu with the bartender of a cruise ship and who makes his life impossible. Jeffrey Tambor has only a small part.",8,4,6,29 November 2010
Marie Antoinette," Versailles
","The luxury and the royal decadence of the late XVIII century in France stand a good reason for the French Revolution. 'Marie Antoinette', the wonderful new film directed by Sofia Coppola, serve to illustrate why that violent turn of events happened in that country.Marie Antoinette, the tragic Austrian princess, is married to the French Dauphin, in order to cement her mother's strategic alliances with other European monarchies. This young woman, in a way, was sacrificed to complete the ambitious plans of her mother. We are given a scenario in which a somewhat naive young woman steps into a culture and a society she didn't belong. To make matters worse, her husband, the Dauphin, was a man not interested in a wife that was imposed on him by his own father.When Marie Antoinette leaves Vienna, she enters a pavilion in the middle of nowhere where everything Austrian is cast away, even her beloved lap dog must be sacrificed. The Comptesse Noailles, in charge of protocol, guides the young girl into what is awaiting her at the court of Versailles. The Austrian princess is not ready for what awaits her in the sophisticated world of the French court.It is somewhat clear that Marie Antoinette never felt love for her husband. She just was the vessel through which the successor of the throne of France would be conceived. When the children did arrive, her husband, then king Louis XVI, was too preoccupied with his own problems to really mean much to his queen. When he gives her the Petit Trianon, a place of her own, Marie Antoinette's real character comes through. She is not aware what her excesses do to the impoverished people in the country. She even had her own fling with Count Fersen. Her fate and her husband was sealed after the storm of the Bastille prison. We witness their departure from Versailles as they leave for an impending death.Sofia Coppola, a director with a style of her own, shows why she is one of the most talented women in the business. Working loosely on Antonia Fraser's novel, she has given her subject a great reading in this film of epic proportions. She was lucky in her choice of collaborators for this project. She counted on people of the caliber of Malena Canonero for those elegant period pieces we see on the screen. Anne Seibel's art direction is flawless and Veronique Melery's sets show us the French court in all its splendor. Lance Acord photographs the historical palace in all its majestic beauty.Another triumph for Ms. Coppola is in the choice of music for 'Marie Antoinette'. She blends the exquisite music by Jean-Philippe Rameau with modern classics, such as 'Fools Rush In', something unheard of in a period film, yet, it makes sense and doesn't feel out of place.As the heroine of the film, Kirsten Dunst, who has worked with the director before, makes a great Marie Antoinette. Her blonde good looks blend perfectly with our idea of what this tragic woman was like. Jason Schartzman, on the other hand, doesn't quite give us the impression he is either the Dauphin, or Louis XVI. Rip Torn plays the earthy Louis XV, the man who kept his mistress, the infamous Madame DuBarry, at the palace to satisfy his passion.Some of the minor characters receive great readings from among others, Judy Davis, who is perfect as the Comtesse Noailles. Rose Byrne is Marie Antoinette's best friend, Asia Argento vamps as Madame DuBarry. Steve Coogan is a great Mercy. Marianne Faithful is seen as the Empress Marie Teresa and Danny Huston is Joseph, Marie Antoinette's brother.'Marie Antoinette' is a great spectacle. It kept reminding this viewer of those large pictures in the Louvre by Jean-Louis David. Oh, and it case you hadn't noticed, Sofia Coppola clearly demonstrates she is a director to reckoned with.",10,6,11,8 December 2006
Casablanca," Casablanca gets better and better as time goes by!
","Saw this classic in DVD format the other night. I must confess that it looks just as good as I remembered it. Michael Curtiz's film is a curious one. It enjoys presently perhaps more popularity than when it originally made its debut in 1942. As new generations discovered the picture, they made it a timeless film, and generations to come will also be charmed by it.The story of Rick and Ilsa and their impossible love affair will be something to be treasured by film lovers forever. Casablanca in the 40s was a hot bed of intrigue; lots of people tried to get there, but perhaps leaving the place was harder because the red tape of that era and the fact that the Nazis had a way to spoil a party. In a lot of ways, this is a dated film. By today standards it would be politically incorrect. But ultimately, we all fall under the spell that Michael Curtiz created and for almost two hours we are in Casablanca among the spies and would be travelers eavesdropping into their conversations and the different schemes going on.Humphrey Bogart was an actor without the looks of some of the handsome male stars of that era, yet, he is mesmerizing as Rick Blaine. It would be hard to imagine another actor playing Rick other that Bogart. Ingrid Bergman was at the height of her career when she made the film. Her chemistry with her co star is one of the best things going, since they made it believable.The rest of the cast is flawless. Paul Henreid, as Victor Lazlo, cuts quite a figure and it is hard to think Ilsa would prefer Rick to this suave and sophisticated man. Claude Rains is good as Capt. Renault. Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.K. Sakall, and above all Dooley Wilson, as Sam, made a magnificent contribution to the film in small roles.Casablanca gets better and better, as time goes by.",10,9,15,27 June 2004
Minority Report," Homage to Phillip Dick
","This is one of the most boring films of all times. I would like to find someone who has enough sense in his brain to tell me I'm wrong. This movie tries to pass as sci-fi without success.Please tell me also, what film in which multimillionaire Tom Cruise has appeared that is really good?. We have to be sincere and acknowledge that Mr. Cruise is a bad actor. He's not believable at all!The best thing going on here are the appearances of Max Von Sydow, Samantha Morton and Colin Farrell. Other than that, don't waste your time (it could have used some badly needed trimming...) and money. Wait until it's shown on cable and it doesn't cost you anything.Poor Phillip Dick. The short story in which this mess was based is a masterpiece in comparison of what Mr. Spielberg and Co. have concocted for us to see.. Mr. Spielberg's career has been greatly hyped and he needs to get a 'reality pill' and reassess his future before his next venture. Hopefully without Robin Williams, or Tom Cruise in it..",5,1,4,31 July 2002
Finding Neverland," Just believe!
","Sir James Barrie was a man who refused to grow up. In doing so, he lived in a Neverland world where children had a prominent place. Mr. Barrie thought the world belong to children.Marc Forster has brilliantly succeeded in showing us Sir James Barrie, whose ideas were ahead of the times in which he lived. He plays homage to the legacy this man left behind, namely, 'Peter Pan', the eternal hopeful story of what's good in mankind and how children will always know better that believing and hoping are the best ways to counter attack the cynicism around them.The casting of Johnny Depp as Sir James, is one of the most felicitous details this movie has going for itself. Not only does Mr. Depp is a natural actor who shines in everything he does, but he goes under the skin of the writer and makes us think we are watching the man himself. Mr. Depp is at his best.Equally brilliant is Kate Winslet. She is Sylvia Llewelyn Davis, the mother of the four boys that befriend Sir James in the park. She sees in him a surrogate father since the real one has died. Evidently the facts have been changed somehow by the authors of the play and the screen treatment because supposedly the real father was alive and well at the time they met Mr. Barrie. Ms. Winslet is charming as Sylvia. This actress conveys the idea of the love of her children and loyalty for the man that came to become a friend and a platonic admirer.Julie Christie plays Sylvia's mother, Emma du Maurier, the bourgeois woman who resents the friendship between her daughter and Sir James. Ms. Christie has not had a big part in films recently and she does wonders to make Mrs. du Maurier to be the hateful person she is, until the end, when she realizes she had been wrong about Sir James all along.Radha Mitchell appears as Mary Barrie, the woman who was against the involvement between her husband and Sylvia. She is a complicated woman who will condemn her man before he is proved guilty. Ms. Mitchell is excellent also in everything she does, although she has little to do in here. Freddie Highmore is Peter, the young man who inspired the character of 'Peter Pan' and he is wonderful as the confused young man until he is asked to believe by the man who was like a father to him and his brothers.A delightful time at the cinema for those young at heart!",8,6,7,25 November 2004
Lifeboat," U Boat
","John Steinbeck's story was cleverly adapted by Jo Swerling, although it appears Ben Hecht was also a collaborator in the screen play. Without a doubt, Alfred Hitchcock scored another hit with 'Lifeboat'. For being done in one set, the boat, the movie never feels claustrophobic. The camera work is extremely effective because it conveys the hard voyage these survivors undertook after their Trans Atlantic ship was attacked by a German U boat.The mood in the boat is driven by a sense of survival. The motley crew that gets on board after the shipwreck presents an assortment of people so different, but joined together by their predicament. It would have been highly impossible if these lives ever met, had it not been for the accident.The characters are well defined. We see a glamorous reporter who manages to be in the boat by herself right after the wreck. The earthy Constance finds more from this experience than with her own work. Kovac, is the rough sailor who takes command. Gus, the injured sailor can't do much more but rely on happy moments in order to keep sane after his terrible predicament. Willy, the devious German, who the group rescues, has an agenda, but the others are too involved in their own problems to see right through this man. Sparks and Alice finally find peace and love with one another. The rich man, Rittenhouse realizes his money is not worth anything if they are not rescued soon.Hitchcock's direction is what made 'Lifeboat' the fine movie, and the classic it became. In a way, the ending is completely anti-climatic as the survivors realize Willy, the captain has steered them into a trap, but at the same time, after they watch the other German ship destroyed by an Allied vessel, they rescue a sailor, who threatens them, but is easily overpowered. We never see them saved, but we know they will be taken care by the approaching ship.Tallulah Bankhead is excellent as Constance. In fact, her performance is perhaps exaggerated in order to convey the sophistication of the character. Little by little she is reduced to nothing as she loses all her material possessions, so dear to her and accepts the reality of the situation. John Hodiak, as Kovac, offers a mysterious side, as well as commanding power. William Bendix as Gus, offers a man who keeps thinking about happier times with his girlfriend.Walter Slezak's performance is also equally satisfying. We know from the beginning he is hiding things from the people in the boat, but at the same time, he offers their only salvation. Hume Cronyn, an actor that worked with Hitchcock in a few movies, is good as Sparks. Mary Anderson is the sweet Alice who acts as a balancing agent. Henry Hull and Canada Lee, round out the magnificent cast of the film.This is a Hitchcock film that deserves to be seen more often, for it offers tremendous rewards to its viewers.",10,40,50,10 March 2005
G.I. Jane," The Navy Seal trainee
","Not having seen this film when it first was released, we had the opportunity of catching up with it recently. In spite of our misgivings, 'G.I. Jane' turned out to be an entertaining picture. Let's not forget this is a Ridley Scott film, which assures the viewer a well crafted product. The screen play is based on a story by Danielle Alexandra, who co-wrote it with David Twohy.The movie mixes the world of politics and the armed forces, in this case, the US Navy. At the center of it all is Jordan O'Neil, a lieutenant that has seen other people get ahead of her because the Navy rejected her in serving aboard a submarine because at that time there were no facilities for a female in that all male environment.Jordan is tapped to go into the Navy Seal program because an ambitious US senator, Lillian DeHaven, from Texas, wants to prove a point. She wants to send a female to integrate an exclusive group of the Navy. The Navy Seal is one of the most difficult jobs in the world. As such, Jordan O'Neil must go to a grueling training, in which, only about forty percent of the people that start, will finish. Jordan proves to have what it takes to be accepted at that high classification. However, things get in her way when her own mentor, who has the closing of some bases in her own state to deal with, decides to take indiscreet photographs of Jordan at a beach party with other female personnel.During the confrontation that ensues, Jordan shows she will not take the senator's BS; Jordan will do anything and will tell the press about what is really happening. Standing up to Sen. DeHaven assures Jordan she will go back to finish what she started.The casting of Demi Moore for the lead role pays off. Ms. Moore, who is in excellent shape shows she can conquer any obstacles that stand in her way. Viggo Mortensen plays the enigmatic, and brutish, Master Chief Urgayle. This man is hard on everyone under his command, but there is a softer side of him as we watch him reading J. M. Coetzee and D. H. Lawrence's poems. Anne Bancroft plays the ruthless senator with relish. David Vadim and James Cavaziel are seen among the recruits going through the hard training. Scott Wilson plays the Commanding Officer of the base where Jordan undergoes the training and he makes no bones about how much he hates the idea of a female breaking the sex line.Ridley Scott directs the film in an almost documentary style, since most of the picture depicts the training aspect. Hugh Johnson's cinematography works well with Piero Scalia's editing. There is even some Mozart and Puccini in the background that are not out of place in the context of the movie.Ridley Scott delivers again in this action packed movie.",7,4,8,28 August 2006
In Bruges," Our men in Bruges
","Ken an Ray, two Irish hit men, are seen arriving in Bruges, Belgium. The have been told to go to that city after a job had gone badly back in Ireland. Their boss, Harry, figures the medieval city will be perfect to get this duo away from all the commotion the crime has caused back home. Ray, doing his first job has to get rid of a priest. In doing so, he also kills an innocent child on his way to confession. The mere idea in killing a minor is something so repugnant, that even the criminal boss is horrified.Harry remembering fondly the time he visited that lovely old city, decides to send the two men there. Ken, who is older, and wiser, decides to take it easy and tries to discover the hidden treasures of Bruges, while Ray, a much younger and inexperienced man thinks the city stinks, literally. Having them share a room is too much for Ray. Ken, on the other hand, doesn't appreciate his babysitting job, knowing his younger partner is a loose cannon.Ray discovers the gorgeous Chloe that appears to be working in a movie being shot in the city. Ray wants to have fun, finding that Chloe is game for whatever. As they are getting comfortable at her place, her boyfriend Eirik, arrives wielding a gun and pointing it to Ray, who is able to get it from him. Little did he know it had blank bullets. In the struggle Ray fires a shot wounding Eirik in one eye.Ken receives an urgent message from Harry, he must eliminate Ray. Ken is not mentally prepared to execute what Harry wants from him. In fact, when he finds the proper time to do it, he changes his mind ans asks Ray to go away and try to stay away from Ireland and England, but as fate has it, Ray is found out by the police because of a violent encounter with a Canadian tourist at a restaurant.Harry decides he cannot trust Ken. He shows up in Bruges to take care of business. The confrontation has Harry and Ken going to a tower that faces the main square. What happens next will surprise us because of the way things develop. The ending parallels what happened to Ray when he killed the boy by accident. In this instance Harry proves he might be a criminal also, but one with scruples.'In Bruges' is a fine film by playwright turned director Martin McDonagh, whose 'Leenanne Trilogy', 'The Liutenant of Inishmore' and other plays have delighted theater goers in the last decade, decided to work on an original story that he magnificently sets in the gorgeous, and touristy city of Bruges, Belgium. Mr. McDonagh shows why he is one of the best writers working these days. With this debut he makes probably the impossible task of making a film that everybody will use as a base of comparison against his future films.The cast is first rate. Brendan Gleeson, the star of his short film, 'Six Shooter' was born to play Ken, the older criminal that has seen a lot during his hard life in that world. This actor clearly shows why he is one of the best character actors around. Equally surprising is Colin Farrell. This actor brings an intensity to his Ray, the ambitious young man who made a mistake in misjudging the way he was to eliminate an enemy and has to pay dearly for it. Ralph Fiennes gives one of the best performances of his career as the crime boss with a conscience. His presence in the film is based on a raw energy we just didn't expect.The supporting cast is excellent. Clemence Poesy is the beautiful Chloe, the woman that catches Ray's eye. Jeremie Renier, the wonderful Belgian actor has a small part as the skinhead Eirik. Thekla Reuten appears as the pregnant hotel owner. Zeljko Ivanek has a small, but important part as the offended tourist that protest about smoking in a restaurant. Jordan Prentice is Jimmy, the dwarf actor working in the film that is being shot and becomes friendly with Ray.The film is photographed lovingly by Eigil Bryld. He takes us through the magical city of Bruges to witness the action, never making the mistake of making it a travelogue. Carter Burwell's fine musical score contributes to our enjoyment of the film. Credit must go to the director for bringing all the elements together in this amazing production.",9,2,5,13 November 2009
To Be or Not to Be," Playing Hamlet in Poland
","Having seen most of Ernst Lubitsch American films, we had missed this one because it's not played often these days. 'To Be, or not to Be' is a wonderful satire that only a director like Lubitsch, with his European background could have pulled. The film is a good comedy that seems to has kept some of its freshness intact.The film works because of the great contribution of Jack Benny and Carole Lombard, who sadly, died before the film had its premiere. They play the Turas, a Polish theatrical couple that foresee the Nazi invasion of their country.In fact, Jack Benny, a man associated as a comedian, first on radio, then on television, was an actor with an uncanny sense of timing. Mr. Benny was a natural for this type of comedy, as he proves in the film. His pairing with Carole Lombard was a stroke of genius. In fact, for being associated to lighter fare, he demonstrates with his take on Joseph Tura, he was an actor of stature.Carole Lombard is seen as Maria Tura, a grand dame of the Polish theater. Ms. Lombard gave a marvelous performance and her contribution to the success of this film is amazing. Robert Stack is seen as the pilot Sobinski. Other faces in the cast include Felix Bressard, Lionel Atwill, Sig Ruman, George Lynn, and others that are perfect under Ernst Lubitsch guidance.This is a film to be treasured because of the work of Jack Benny and the impeccable direction of Ernst Lubitsch.",8,24,55,11 November 2005
Monster," Big girls don't cry
","Patty Jenkins accomplishes the impossible with this film. She has transformed an otherwise gorgeous woman, Charlize Theron, into the monster that was Aileen Wuornos. What turns a common person into a monster? In the case of Ms Wuornos, we get to know that she was formed by the environment where she comes from. She is the victim of abuse, growing up in a household where she is a burden. She becomes an outcast whose only alternative is to turn into prostitution, since that's the only thing she can do with no other skills to herself.Supposedly this tragic figure was not gay. At the beginning of the story she walks into a bar that caters to gays, unknown to her. Selby is at the bar and feels an attraction for the rough Aileen, someone completely opposite of her. Ms. Theron's transformation is incredible. It's probably the role of her career; nothing from now on will compare to this character at all. Christina Ricci's work as Selby is not as flashy, but she holds her own, as she is an accomplished actress who has probably more experience than her co-star. Since the role of Selby pales against the work of Charlize Theron, she was bypassed for a look at the best featured actress.The other surprise was Bruce Dern, who has nothing to do in the film, but has a key scene in the film.Ms. Jenkins has worked wonders with this film based in a true story. She has a great future ahead of her.",8,0,1,12 March 2004
The Rookie," A fast ball
","Jimmy Morris' passion for baseball dominated his life. The son of a Navy recruiter, Jimmy was forced to move from town to town, leaving behind his dreams of playing a major leagues, specially after arriving in the remote Big Lake, Texas, where it appears his father had his longest tour of duty. To make matters worse, football was the favorite sport.The story, which starts during the early years of the Morris' arrival in Big Lake, changes to show us a grown Jimmy, now married, and the father of two children, managing the local high school team. Jim, who evidently tried a spot in the majors, got injured, and is resigned to the kind of life he didn't want back in his youth. One thing he never loses is the speed in which he throws a baseball. That quality will ultimately be the factor that will win him a spot with the Tampa Bay major league team, where he will make a name for himself, realizing his dream of playing professional baseball.John Lee Hancock, the director of the film, written by Mike Rich, gives us a glimpse on the life of a man who never gave up his desire for being part of the sport that he loved. Supposedly, this picture is based on the real Jim Morris, who went to make a name for himself because of the gift he brought to the game.It's impossible not to like the earnest performance of Dennis Quaid, an actor that is always reliable to give his best. The star is surrounded by the excellent Rachel Griffiths, relegated here to be the saintly Mrs. Morris, and Brian Cox, one of the best character actors working in movies today. Also Beth Grant shows up as Jim's mother. The film doesn't surprise, since we know where it will end, eventually, but it is a labor of love from Mr. Hancock and all the people involved in the project.",7,1,1,3 February 2010
The Fan," Death of a salesman
","Gil Renard's passion for baseball consumes him. In fact, the sport he loves seems to get the best of him. His own marriage has failed dismally; he is involved in an acrimonious divorce and his son seems to have taken to the new man in his mother's life. Gil, who is a sporting knives salesman, has problems with his clients to the point that his boss has no other alternative than to get rid of him.What is Gil supposed to do? When his idol, Bobby Rayburn is hired for the San Francisco Giants, as an outfielder, Gil feels his team will have a chance for the pennant. His obsession will get the best of him. He even tries to influence another player into switching uniform numbers with his new idol. When all that fails, Gil decides to take a different path and ends up stalking Rayburn with terrible consequences.'The Fan', directed by Tony Scott starts on an upbeat note. The film based on a Peter Abrahams book we didn't read, with a screenplay by Phoef Sutton, plays well until it has Gil Renard going nuts when his whole world crumbles.Robert Deniro, under Mr. Scott's direction, does what he can to the script that has him playing the deranged Gil in ways that doesn't help the film. It's fun to watch Mr. Deniro impersonating Gil Renard, whose passion for the American pastime ruins his life. We get a hint of how he got involved in the sport at the end of the movie. Wesley Snipes makes one of the best appearances of his career. In minor roles we see a wasted Ellen Barkin, Benicio del Toro and John Leguizamo, among others.This is a film for Mr. Deniro's fans.",6,8,9,8 April 2008
Two for the Money," The odds
","There is a scene at the beginning of the film that seems to set the tone of 'Two for the Money'. We watch as Walter Abrams is talking on the phone with someone who will not be able to provide an elephant for his daughter's birthday party. Walter barks to his assistant, 'Get me Ringling'. When the call finally comes through, he demands to know whether he is talking to Barnum or Bailey, which is a funny line. Wasn't P.T. Barnum himself the man famous for that quotation about a sucker being born every minute? Walter Abrams is a man who is in the sports betting business. He and his associates stand to make millions out of the jerks they pursue to do their betting with his firm. Having found a new rising star, Brandon Lang, a man that knows a lot about the intricacies of point spreads and picking winners. Walter wants to transforms him into a man who can bring more money into his outfit.In order to do that, Walter must groom him to 'look' the part. As such, Brandon becomes John Anthony, the man who can produce fabulous results every week end during the football series. Brandon gets to meet the insiders, but little does he know who he is dealing with, or much less, what is expected of him. After all, he is just as good as the winners he can produce.The film, directed by D. J. Caruso, a man who has worked extensively in television, has a glossy look. The screen play by Dan Gilroy could have used some tighter editing, because at two hours it feels a bit long.Al Pacino, as Walter, has some good moments; we have seen him in better roles, and this one is a composite of other things he has done before. Mr. Pacino compensates when the screen play is not going anywhere by applying an intensity that doesn't go well with the others playing opposite him. Matthew McConaughey is a light weight actor who, aside from his good looks, doesn't bring anything to this story. Rene Russo is obviously a tall woman who towers over Mr. Pacino in most of their scenes together. Their relationship doesn't come across as being a real thing. Jeremy Piven and Armand Assante make good contributions in supporting the principals.While 'Two for the Money' is by no means a horrible film, it just doesn't have anything new to say.",7,71,102,28 October 2005
Au Revoir les Enfants," Stolen innocence
","The sad days of France during WWII take a new meaning, as a Jewish mother, in order to spare her young son of the horrors of the times, decides to send him to a catholic boarding school, where the local Carmelite priests welcomed, and protected, some of these unfortunate children. It was not an easy for Jean Bonnet, the newly arrived boy to settle into a world that was totally foreign to him.One thing becomes clear immediately, Jean was a smart kid, way ahead of his classmates. He was an easy object of ridicule because of his introspective nature. At the same time, Jean attracted the attention of Julien Quentin, who went on to become Jean's best friend, and whose life was touched by the incident he lived at the school. Life in the boarding school was not a happy one for many of the children. Being away from family took a heavy toll on most of them, while for others was a great time to be away in a somewhat safe environment. Justin, who spies on Jean as he prays during the night, is the first to discover his real identity, which was a well kept secret. In fact, Justin is quite concerned as the boys are brought to a bath house knowing Jews were not welcome. The same goes when during mass, Jean makes an attempt to receive communion from one of the priests, who clearly knew he was not catholic and passes him by without giving him the sacrament. The film is Louis Malle's tribute to a similar incident he lived during his boyhood. It is the most autobiographical of his work, dedicated to his children. 'Au revoir les enfants' is a timeless account about an era in which the horrors of the war was seen through the eyes of innocent children, totally at sea in the madness going on around them. The gloomy winter atmosphere was photographed by Renato Berta, a frequent collaborator of Mr. Malle.The two principals do an excellent work. Gaspard Manesse who played Justine Quentin and Raphael Fejto, showed great promise, but did not go into great screen careers as one would have hoped.",8,2,3,22 October 2011
12 Angry Men," Beyond a reasonable doubt
","Having seen the film before, we decided to take another look recently when it showed up on a cable channel. This Sidney Lumet 1957 film still packs a lot of power, even though times have changed in the way our justice system works. The screen play by Reginald Rose shows his brilliant insight into human beings that are called to sit as jurors in a murder case.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you don't want to read any further.It's 1957 when this case goes to court. We watch the accused man staring toward the panel in whose hands his fate rests. The jury is all male. We get to know that a public defendant was appointed to defend the accused man. We realize he hasn't done a great job, as most of the men in the jury room are convinced this boy is guilty before he has been proved innocent.We watch as the men are settling into their chairs around the deliberating table, and how a juror is standing by the window looking toward the streets below, lost in thought. It's stifling in the room. Those were the days of not having air conditioned all over, so these men are sweating in the uncomfortable room during one of the worst days of the summer.As the men proceed to have a preliminary vote, juror number eight casts a 'not guilty' vote that shocks the room. How dare he go against the majority? Who is he to stand in the way of what seems to be an open and shut case? This guy is guilty! Thus begins the deliberations in which all these men bring their own prejudices and biases to determine if the boy will go to the electric chair, which by all appearances, seems to be the case here. It's because of one decent man that doesn't mind facing the rest that we get to know why the accused couldn't have done the murder the authorities say he committed. In the process the jurors will get to understand the meaning of justice.This drama owes Henry Fonda a debt of gratitude. We can't think of any other actor playing this juror. Mr. Fonda exudes kindness and he is the only person in the room that is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt the boy has killed his own father. Not only did he make a contribution as an actor, but also helped produced the movie.Lee J. Cobb, one of the great American actors of the last century, is seen as a juror that sees in the accused young man his own estranged son, who he hasn't seen in a couple of years, having left home because of the conflict with the old man. Mr. Cobb is just the opposite of Mr. Fonda, and he gives an intense performance to show us this man in turmoil. The rest of the cast is wonderful. Each one has his own moment to shine.There is not a single moment that rings false in the movie. In reading a couple of comments about '12 Angry Men', some people marvel there were no women in the jury, or that the accused man's case hasn't been presented by the defense attorney in a more effective way. We have to remember first of all, the times in which the action takes place, and the fact that being a poor man, the accused man has been given an attorney who was obviously not interested in his defense. The young man being from a minority migrant group didn't elicit sympathy from these jurors, at all, which might have been the prosecution's goal in going along with the selection.This is a movie that should be seen by anyone serving in a jury in a court of justice. Mr. Lumet and Mr. Rose have created a timeless film that will be the standard in which everything else is judged.",10,23,36,8 February 2005
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Breaking up is hard to do
","Imagine Cal Weaver's surprise at the end of what appears a nice dinner at a good restaurant. For dessert, his wife Emily, undecided what to order, asks him for a divorce. Cal's world collapses right under his feet. After all, having been married to a woman for twenty five years and whom he considered his soul mate, it was not in his book. The reason for Emily's request is she has been seeing a man from her office. The Weavers are well off. They have three children, but the person most affected by the news is Robbie, a teenager going through some changes.As Cal decides to move from the house, he must find a bachelor pad for himself. Cal, who is an uncool man, must find himself a way to continue with his life, something he finds inconceivable at his age. Cal begins frequenting a singles bar. He cannot get over the suave guy he watches picking up women every night. It appears to him, the man always scores. One night, the man, Jacob, approaches Cal with a proposal: stop whining and get a life. In fact, Jacob agrees to guide Cal into uncharted territory.What follows is an almost miracle transformation of Cal. His luck with women is assured with his hew attitude. Cal scores big with Kate, a teacher, who is a sex animal. Cal cannot get his mind from Emily and the family in spite of his new social graces. We watch him going at night to tend to the garden without being seen by anyone. Robbie, his son, has a crush on Jessica, the baby sitter Emily insists in engaging. The newly found life style does not bring happiness to Cal. Unknown to him, Jacob met and fell in love with his grown up daughter Hannah, something that shocks him, knowing well about the reputation of the man. In reality, Jacob had a change of heart as he met the young woman. He is a new man, but Cal does not see it that way. It takes a lot of convincing for Cal to accept his former mentor as the boyfriend of Hannah. In fact, at Robbie's graduation from middle school the whole family comes together, as Emily realizes her mistake.A fun comedy directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Recqua, following their success with 'I Love Your Phillip Morris'. The screenplay is by Dan Fogelman. Although a bit formulaic, the film keeps moving at a great pace as the situations keep the amusement. The creators have stayed away from dwelling on Emily's deceit as well as Cal's sudden exploits, making it more real. The teenage angst of Robbie is examined in a light mood.Not being a Steve Carell's fan, one has to recognize he does a better job, helped no doubt, by the direction he was given. He is an actor that works perhaps too hard to be liked. The real performance in the picture is Ryan Gosling, usually seen in more dramatic roles. Mr. Gosling keeps getting better all the time, doing an excellent turn as the nice predator who always gets lucky. Julianne Moore has not much to do. Her relationship is not played too much. A wonderful small part for Marisa Tomei as Kate, the teacher. Emma Stone is also notable for the sweetness she brings to Jessica. Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton do a nice job as Robbie and Jessica. Kevin Bacon has little to do as the home wrecker.'Crazy, Stupid, Love' was one of the best comedies that came out in 2011.",7,0,1,11 March 2012
Happy Gilmore," Five under par
","A hockey player, turned into a golf ace, is the premise for the movie. Dennis Dugan has delivered a funny comedy, even though it doesn't break any ground on this genre.Adam Sandler is somehow controlled in the film. He delivers as Happy Gilmore, a man that takes up golf as a way to make enough money to save the family home. The grandmother will lose the house because of the expenses of paying for the nursing home, where has gone. The nursing home is ruled by the maniac Ben Stiller, who terrorizes the lady. It's strictly a formula movie that can be played by the numbers. Watching it without any expectations proved to be better than resisting the inanity of the screen play.The funniest moments are the scenes of Mr. Sandler with Carl Weathers, the man with a wooden hand. The two actors are immensely funny. Without a doubt, the best thing in the picture is the sequence involving Bob Barker playing Gilmore's partner. Mr. Barker is hilarious as the man that realizes how bad Gilmore is and wants to teach him a lesson for ruining his chance in the tournament.The film is mildly funny. If nothing else is playing, it's worth a look.",6,2,5,5 January 2005
The Notebook," Like mother, like daughter. Southern Belles.
","My only excuse for going to see this film was the heat and humidity of the day. It must have been 90 degrees and 200% humidity in the shade! The temperature made me do it!Nick Cassavettes' style of direction is completely opposite of his father's, the otherwise innovative and genial late John Cassavettes. In electing to film this light weight book, he chose a possible easy crowd pleaser, or an excellent way to get me out of the sun into the air conditioning of the movie theater.The story is one cliché after another. The worst of the film is Ryan Gosling, an actor that must have a good agent behind him because if he had to rely on his acting abilities, he'd starve to death. Rachel McAdams is irritating as Allie, the rich Southern girl at the center of the story.Gena Rowland's Alzheimer's is cinematic! Being confined to a nursing home, she is groomed lovingly; her gorgeous shade of blonde, is maintained by the attentive staff! Talk about a reality check! This film stretches one's imagination big time.How about David Thornton, as Allie's father. Was young Nick Cassavettes aware that he comes on the screen as the worst possible non-Southern stereotype in the movies throughout the ages? I always have to think twice about comments in this forum calling for an Oscar consideration so early in the year. Come next February, let's hope the colleagues of these 'stars' will forget about them and of this unfortunate silly film.Don't say you weren't warned. If you can choose between seeing this movie and having a refreshing drink to calm your thirst and cool you all over: run into your favorite bar and have a summery pink drink instead!",6,12,20,20 July 2004
Bloody Sunday," Subtitles please!
","The style suits the action, but pray tell me, did anyone understand the dialogue of this film?Had I not known the background of the situation, I would have not learned a thing by watching this docu-drama. It is very intense, no question about it, but we don't get to know who's is who, or how does it relate to the people in the demonstration.A lot of Irish and English films leave the viewer wanting for subtitles, specially if they insist in using an Irish brogue, and or to speak to us in cockney. It would be 'grand' if we lived in that part of the world, but for our American ears, we can't make out a thing.Otherwise, this is a fine film, packed with action.",7,3,10,15 October 2002
Coffee and Cigarettes," No latte please, we're Americans!
","Jim Jarmusch stays away too long between films. This is a movie about different points of view on the subject of how we interact with friends and strangers on a number of issues. Mr. Jarmusch knows a thing or two about watching people as the different vignettes unfold on the screen.I thought the funnier segments were the ones with Steve Buscemi and Cinque and Jolie Lee in Memphis, and the one with Cate Blanchett playing the dual role of two cousins meeting after not having seen each other for a while.
The best stories come last. Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan are just hysterical, as two English actors working in Hollywood who might be related. And of course, the last tale with the amazing Bill Murray is excellent. The invaluable contribution of RZA and GZA to the vignette is amazing.
Pleas Jim, don't stay away too long for the next movie.",8,3,6,20 June 2004
Spider-Man 2," Spinning a web
","Sam Raimi in his second installment about the comics hero, Spiderman, outdoes himself. The film is not only pleasant to the eye, but it's  fun to watch. The technical details are incredible. The movie will keep the viewer entertained with all the high acrobatics and daredevil tricks.The only thing that bothered me, is that this Spiderman is bicoastal, or maybe bicitizen. I'll explain: During the elevated train scene we are given a view of Second City, Chicago, as those trains only circulate in that city, but not in New York, and that's been so for many years. It's incredible that we're watching something taking place in Gotham and suddenly we're in the Loop with danger to fall into Lake Michigan if Spiderman doesn't stop that train. Maybe it was only me, but since I couldn't stay to check the credits, I've no idea if it's indicated in them.Toby Maguire does a tremendous job as the hero who spins webs all over the city. Kirsten Dunst is also appealing as M.J., the woman that Peter Parker adores. Alfredo Molina is excellent, as always, as the bad scientist who is a monster. Rosemary Harris as the aunt is perfect and James Franco is also good.A fun time at the movies.",8,2,4,25 July 2004
The Secret in Their Eyes," The secret of his eyes
","A retired investigator, Benjamin Esposito, from a criminal court in Buenos Aires, decides to write about a case that has haunted him since the days he was assigned to cover the crime. In putting his thoughts in paper, he realizes the case is still unresolved. What's more, he is more involved now, than he was back then. For that he must go back and speak to Irene, the district attorney, under whose office he worked. Irene, he realizes, is the woman he has never forgotten in spite of being apart for so many years.The crime in question involved a beautiful newlywed woman found raped and stabbed to death in her apartment. Benjamin and the other investigator, Pablo Sandoval, try to gather as much information about the circumstances that triggered the murder. Both men are hindered by an elusive killer whose only, and possible identity, is a photograph that the investigators find in an album they get from the husband of the victim, Ricardo Morales. The thing that sparked their suspicion is Isidoro Gomez who appears in a couple of pictures almost adoring the dead woman, who obviously, he couldn't have. Benjamin is a self made man. He came from humble origins, in contrast to Irene Menendez Hastings, a girl from money and privilege. In a class conscious society like Argentina, their possible involvement would have been nil. Yet, one can see how Irene gets under Benjamin's skin. Their attraction is mutual, but it will never happen. She, too, is aware of the way he feels, but ultimately, decorum prevails. After all, Irene is about to marry a society man. The pursuit of Isidoro Gomez doesn't go anywhere. Pablo Sandoval's drinking friends crack the code about Isidoro Gomez's love for a soccer team, the Racing of Avellaneda. The suspect, who proves to be a master in the way he can outrun Benjamin and Pablo, is followed to his favorite place, the soccer stadium. When they finally catch up with the suspect, someone well connected with the government of then president Isabel Peron, bails him out. It was clear they had no chance in ever catching the assassin. Benjamin, in frustration leaves his post after his partner Pablo Sandoval is killed, a death that was meant for him.Years later, Benjamin returns to Buenos Aires and goes back to Irene with the notes he has written. Irene, now married with children, realizes whatever they felt about one another, never having said a word, is now stronger than ever. Benjamin gets lucky when he decides to pay a surprise visit to Ricardo Morales, the widower of the slain woman. When Benjamin finds him at a remote place in the country, he is for an unexpected surprise.Juan Jose Campanella is one of Argentina's best directors. Working with Eduardo Sacheri, and his novel, 'La pregunta de sus ojos', the director struck gold. The film can be a bit disorienting for people without much knowledge of Argentine history that is at the center of the story. Most of the action takes place in the Buenos Aires of 1974, when the corrupt government of Peron's widow Isabel, was in power. One can relate to the way the story of those years work well with what the creators wanted to present. With the presence of Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil the director had it made. Both are excellent actors who will enhance any film in which they appear. They both shine as Benjamin and Irene. But it is with the supporting players that Mr. Campanella achieve greatness. Guillermo Francella, who plays Pablo Sandoval does an amazing job. As he proved with 'Rudo y Cursi', Mr. Francella steals the film from the principals any time he is seen. Pablo Rago, is brilliant in the way he approaches his role as the husband of the assassinated wife and whose life ended on the tragic day she was killed.Felix Monti's atmospheric cinematography works well, capturing that bygone era. So does the fine musical score by Fererico Jusid and Emilio Kauderer. This is another triumph for Juan Jose Campanella.",8,23,31,12 March 2010
Billy Elliot," Coal miner's son
","Can a boy from a macho background overcome all obstacles and go to be a star in the Royal Ballet company? Well, that is the premise of this feel good film that we saw when it first came out, but didn't comment. Watching it for a second time, recently, didn't produce the same effect as when initially seen on the big screen. Something was lost, but it is still an inspirational story.Billy, a young boy from a poor background in the coal country in the North of England, realizes he has a passion for dancing. Since he doesn't know how to channel his desire for becoming a classic dancer, he has to get all the help he can get. With the guidance of Mrs. Wilkinson, a local dance coach, Billy finds the inspiration he needs to go on into that world, so foreign to a young boy of his class.In a way, we couldn't help comparing 'Billy Elliot' to 'Educating Rita', not that they are similar in any shape, or form. Maybe the presence of the irrepressible Julie Walters, who appears in this case as the teacher, was the link and the basis of comparison. Her work in the film doesn't dominate the action, but her contribution to the overall success of it is an undeniable factor. Young Jamie Bell endears himself to the audience with his take on the would be dancer that wants to expand his own talent.Stephen Daltry directed with panache the screenplay by Lee Hall. Mr. Daltry's work with the two principals wins us over. This small film couldn't have worked as a Hollywood production, which probably would have blown the action out of proportion and would have turned the story into something else.",7,2,3,21 November 2008
127 Hours," Trapped
","Having seen the trailer for '127 Hours' did not prepare us for the powerful impact the film had on us, as well as the audience with which we saw it. Aron Ralston amazing story is one of the most gripping accounts in memory about an episode that almost killed him. Make no mistake, this is a difficult film to sit through.A mountain climbing week-end, and exploration in the breathtaking Utah's Blue John Canyon turns into the biggest ordeal this young man had to endure. What starts as a fun time going through the rugged territory, turns into a nightmare when Aron falls into a narrow passage and a huge rock crashes his hand. Aron is left to fend for himself trying to get himself extricated from the rock that immobilized him. In spite of the nature of the story, Aron's positive attitude saves him from what would have been a sure death if he would not have been able to get out of the situation. Throughout his ordeal Aron Ralston is even able to reflect on the quality of the tools his mother had given him as a present for his activities. All he asks himself is his wisdom for not taking his reliable Swiss Army knife that must have been his companion in different trips, rather than the Chinese kit he got as a present.That Aron Ralston was able to tell his story is a document about human survival. This young man showed a courage that speaks volumes. Had he despaired with the blow he received, he certainly would not have been able to find a solution to the situation. The film is based on Aron Ralston's book 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place', adapted for the screen by the director of the film, Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy. The creators take us for a fantastic adventure to witness what it must have been like during those five days and seven hours that Aron almost died. In spite of the type of situation Aron endures, it is not a claustrophobic situation because, in a way, we realize Mr. Ralston had a somewhat bittersweet end in the ordeal he went through. The impressive music score by A.R. Rahman, who had worked with the director previously, adds texture to the narrative. The great camera work by Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, gives a fantastic look to the production.James Franco is the whole picture. The actor shows his talent by capturing the essence of the man he is impersonating. One feels his anguish, his despair, his hope for survival, and his courage in dealing with a situation that for someone else might have been a tragedy impossible to overcome. Mr. Franco gives the best performance of his career.Danny Boyle loves to give his audiences bigger than life films. Well, with this one, he clearly outdid himself.",10,2,4,12 December 2010
Pirate Radio," Rocking the boat
","It is almost impossible to think that pop music was limited to young English listeners. At the height of the Beatles popularity, only thirty minutes of the BBC radio programming was devoted to broadcast the music that was revolutionizing the country, and the world, for that matter. It only took one enterprising person to figure out a way to establish a system that utilized a ship navigating in international waters with a powerful range to bring the music fans that never tired of listening to their idols.Richard Curtis, the director of this engaging film, imagines the scene aboard that vessel to illustrate the story. Quentin, a man with big ideas attracted a lot of disc jockeys to animate the programs. These individuals found a way to get to the mostly young crowd that followed their broadcasts avidly. Life on board was a constant party. The mainly male passengers were kept by Quentin with a lot of food and drink. Their camaraderie was well felt, something that was transmitted in their programs to the captive public in England. The source of revenue came from paid ads that kept the enterprise afloat.The powers that be, headed by Sir Alistair Dormandy, decided to eliminate, at all costs, the pirate radio. The elder ministers felt the new kind of music was a bad influence on the young people in England, so they have to suppress them. To make it possible, they bring a man that was supposed to have the solution to the problem, Dominic Twatt, a hard nosed individual that would do anything to stop the music coming through the airwaves. Although he is proved powerless, he kept interfering with the pirate operation.The result is a film that reflects the times in which the action took place. The ensemble cast is excellent. Bill Nighy is Quentin. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the Count, one of the popular hosts. Rhys Ifans makes a wicked Gavin Cavannagh. Kenneth Brannagh plays the hard nosed minister that wanted to silence the 'noise'. Jack Davenport appears as Mr. Twatt. Even Emma Thompson comes on board in a funny sequence. She is the mother of young Carl, played by Tom Sturridge. The film is light and fun for the most part thanks to Richard Curtis and the fabulous music of that era heard in the background.",8,2,2,3 December 2010
Brokeback Mountain," Loving cowboys
","Annie Proulx brilliant short story was only eleven pages long, but it felt as though it was a full novel. This was a short story that demanded to be seen as a full length movie, which with the help of its director, Ang Lee, and the glorious screen play by Larry McMurtry, and Diana Ossana, who went to produce the film, is a triumph for all involved in it for the frankness and understanding they brought to it. There are changes in the story, one guesses to fit the cinematic treatment.'Brokeback Mountain' is basically about love and not about sex, as one might have been led to believe. In fact, the subject has been treated with the utmost good taste as the director doesn't want to expose more than he has to. Ennis Del Mar and Jack Swift find one another and they have no problem in what they embark to. When the end of their herding days end, they walk away from each other without any promises of keeping in touch or meeting again.When Ennis and Jack see each other after four years, it's clear the feelings they have for one another have been bottled in their souls. Not even Alma Del Mar, who has seen them in a compromising way, can separate them. Alma realizes she can't get between Ennis and Jack. It's clear they share a passion that she, or Lureen, Jack's wife cannot pull them apart. Even though this is something that is not meant to be, both men can't let go of one another, even if it's only meant to happen a couple of times a year.Heath Ledger comes out better in his take of Ennis. His sensitive approach to the role shows a young actor giving an excellent performance and in total control of his craft. Jake Gyllenhaal, with his dark looks is also wonderful as Jack Twist.The film shows a good director getting the best out of his team. The atmospheric music by Gustavo Santaolalla blends itself well with the story. The Canadian Rockies are magnificently photographed by Rodrigo Prieto who has given the film an elegant and regal look.Ultimately, the film belongs to Ang Lee who has a keen eye for making this story appealing.",10,44,64,9 December 2005
Insomnia," Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!
","Insomnia almost put me to sleep! Why do talented people as the ones behind this film go into a remake of something that was done better already, instead of creating something fresh and new.?Al Pacino is a candidate of a total makeover. Send him to the next session of Oprah so they can create a new image and a visit to a plastic surgeon should help out great Pacino continue for a long time as a hero on the big screen.There are 2 great things that happen in this film: Martin Donovan is seen in the first scenes and Robin Williams doesn't show his face until almost the last half of the film. That, together with the rainy atmosphere of Alaska started me, and a few others in the audience, yawning and falling asleep.Better luck next time Mr. Nolan. I wish you would find an original story to direct your next 'memento'...",6,0,1,11 July 2002
500 Days of Summer," A summer breeze
","Love and romance sometimes don't turn the way one had hoped for. Tom Hansen, the young man at the center of the story warns us from the start this is not 'a love story'. His relationship with the beautiful Summer Finn, who is an assistant to his boss at a greeting card company, is told in not linear fashion, perhaps to make the viewer concentrate in the nuances of their romance.Summer is a free spirited soul not into conventions. Tom is a more serious person, more grounded. The attraction between them is real, as we witness them at their happiest moments, or at other periods where they have disagreements. Summer, who obviously likes Tom, is the one that makes the initial contact after seeing him around the office. As it turns out, they both love the same kind of music, The Smiths, which she sings badly. Her favorite Beatle is Ringo Starr.How could it be possible for these two not to stay together? Like in life, not everything is perfect, so Tom and Summer, who on the surface seemed to have found a common ground, end up going in different directions to our amazement.This sunny comedy directed by Marc Webb is one of the best reasons for escaping the summer heat to be in good company. Mr. Webb story works differently than many of this genre by presenting the material in a whimsical fashion and not falling into the pattern most other romances take to be on the safe side. Mr. Webb had a good screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber who give the film a light touch for the viewer's enjoyment.The pairing of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who usually can be seen in more serious work, and Zooey Deschanel, paid off well. Their chemistry as the lovers at the middle of this tale is amazing because each complements the other big time.",7,3,6,16 August 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," The United States of Mexico
","It was refreshing to see how Americans were denied entry into Mexico because of the sheer numbers of refugees trying to enter the country legally, or otherwise. The fact that Mexico closed their borders so Americans couldn't get there was quite sobering, when actually, it's just the opposite. The fact that our government went there to try to normalize the things up north and that our neighbors to the south opened their arms and their country to make us get back on our feet is something that Hollywood, or for that matter, the powers that be, will never think of contemplating.As far as 'The Day After Tomorrow', directed by Ronald Emmerich, it presents a situation that calls for preventive measures from our country and all industrialized nations in order to avoid the apocalypse the film presents. The idea of a storm, so huge as this one, serves as a warning to prevent it at all costs.Mr. Emmerich has given us a film that is entertaining and poses a lot of questions about the way we humans do things here on earth. Dennis Quaid, is good portraying the desperate father that risks his own life trying to look for his son, trapped in New York's public library. Jake Gyllenhaal, doesn't have his usual intensity in the role of the son. Emmy Rossum, Ian Holm, Tamlyn Tomita, Sela Ward, and the others in the cast do whatever they can to convey the dire conditions they have to battle.'The Day After Tomorrow' is film that is a warning of what we are doing to the environment and the possible consequences.",7,7,14,22 December 2005
Match Point," Lucky man!
","Having avoided Woody Allen's last two films, and because of recommendation from a friend, we decided to give Mr. Allen another chance. With this new film, Mr. Allen seeks to regain his loyal fans by taking them for a ride to England, where probably most of the money for the picture was found. The results are mixed, but not a total failure. It's by no means, the great movie most people are telling us it is.Chris Wilton is a lucky man! As an old tennis player, he has had it. But like other men in his position, he finds a job in a tennis club as a pro. Since this is a place where the English upper classes go to, it's no surprise he meets Tom Hewett there. Chris has settled in London in order to take advantage of the cultural life there, something he has been lacking of. Tom is instrumental for introducing Chris, not only to the opera performance, but to his family, who accepts him as one of their own.Chris doesn't appear to be a social climber. It's just that he is at the right place, at the right time. The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for what will follow. An explanation is heard, about how in a tennis game, the ball that bounces over the top of the net will determine who wins the match. In the ironic twist of fate at the end of the movie, something similar happens, although not related to a tennis match.Mr. Allen has gathered an interesting cast of mainly English actors that do good work under his direction. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is Chris, the lucky man who charms the pants of the Hewetts. Scarlett Johansson, in one of the sexiest parts she has played, makes a valuable contribution as the American aspiring actress. Emily Mortimer plays Chloe, who becomes the wife of Chris and his entry ticket into a world of money. Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton are seen as the older Hewetts. Matthew Goode appears as Tom. In minor roles we see the wonderful Margaret Tyzack in a pivoting role and James Nesbitt as a police detective.One of the best things in the film are the wonderful opera arias by Donizetti, Bizet, Rossini, and Verdi. We are even treated to a song from Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'The Lady in White'. Remi Adefarasin's cinematography serves the movie well.One can only hope Mr. Allen has left the neurotics back home in New York!",8,27,51,22 January 2006
Hotel Rwanda," A document for humanity
","The madness one sees in this brilliant film is hard to imagine, yet it occurred in Rwanda. Terry George, the director, captures those terrible days in Rwanda in his film 'Hotel Rwanda'. Mr. George has to be commended for bringing to the screen a detailed account of a country in chaos. Working with Keir Pearson on the screen play, the director presents us with the horrors of what the country lived during the holocaust that befell Rwanda.At the center of the story is Paul Rusesabagina, a courageous man who witnessed first hand the worst days of the Hutu rebellion and its bloody aftermath. This man alone was able to protect and to save more than a thousand Rwandans that clearly would not be around today, had it not been for his tremendous stand against people that showed no mercy, or wouldn't reason about what they were doing to their fellow citizens.The performance of Don Cheadle, as Paul Rusesabagina, is worth the price of admission! This wonderful actor projects such an intelligence that it's hard to find in any American film released in 2004. Mr. Cheadle was right to portray this man; it was a role he was born to play. Mr. Cheadle got under the skin of the hotel manager and runs away with the film. It's hard to keep ones eyes from this commanding performance.The rest of the mostly black cast is excellent. One must single out Sophie Okoneko, who plays Paul's wife with such dignity that she perfectly matches Mr. Cheadle's performance. Nick Nolte is fine as the UN Colonel trying to keep peace in a place gone mad.Congratulations to Mr. George. With this film he touches us in more ways than we imagined. The unfortunate tragedy could well have been avoided if the international community would have intervened sooner, but obviously, it didn't even try until it was too late.",10,17,25,19 March 2005
Crash," The city of angels
","Paul Haggis immense achievement in 'Crash' left us breathless and speechless. Mr. Haggis and his collaborator and screen writer, Robert Moresco, take us to an area where most American film makers, or studios, dare not go. We are given a series of unconnected stories, that at one level, seem not to make sense, and at the end of the film, we are surprised to realize how everything one sees in the film is inter connected in one way, or another.'Crash' is not a film that wants to be politically correct. The ugly truth of race relations in America are nowhere more visible than in the Los Angeles of today, where Mr. Haggis places the story. The city, with its complexity of cultures, is the right territory where one can see the way things are done in that city, which might stand as an example of a multi-racial community in America today.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you'd like to stop reading here.Los Angeles police has been at the center of several notorious cases, which in a way, seems to parallel what the film is following. At the same time, we are shown decent people in that department trying to cope with the job to protect its citizens of all colors and races.One of those people happen to be Graham, the detective that is battling his own demons. His mother is a drug addict that is trying to go straight. His own brother is a common criminal ready to hijack valuable cars for a profit. Graham must make a deal at the end of the film in order to protect his brother. In a way, he too, is a victim of the same system that he is trying to uphold.We meet a black bourgeois couple Cameron and Christine, who are stopped by a cruising patrol car when something lewd seems to be taking place in the car. The crooked police officer Graham humiliates and belittles this innocent couple that happened to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Cameron is a spineless black who would rather be abased than open his mouth to protest officer Graham's indecent groping of Christine. Graham's partner Hanson is indignant about what he watches his partner do to the helpless woman.There is also an up and coming yuppie couple, Rick and Jean, who we see walking to their car. Two black hoodlums mug them and rob their expensive Navigator SUV. He turns out to be a D.A. that is more interested in the image he would project to black minorities if he goes too hard on the guys that steal his car. The wife, though, has no problem in spewing her venom directed to the Hispanic man, Daniel, that has been summoned to change the locks of the house.Daniel, the Hispanic locksmith is also called to fix a lock at an Iranian store whose owner is Farhad, an indignant man reduced to do menial things. Daniel fixes the lock, but not the door itself that earlier is seen as not closing properly. When Farhad tells Daniel about it, he tells he fixed the problem, but the door is not his concern. Daniel is cursed by the ignorant man that cannot comprehend how the locksmith refuses to fix the door. Instead of reasoning, the Iranian goes into a frenzy. When the store is broken into, later on, Farhad's reaction is that Daniel has done it. There's only one way to fix the problem: take the gun to Daniel's home and kill him.Daniel has moved his family from a crime infested area to this new neighborhood where he feels it's safe to live with his family. We watch Daniel in a tender moment with his daughter in which an imaginary invisible cape that will protect the girl. That same imaginary cape is what seems to save her from the shot directed to her father, as she happens to get in front of it. This sobering experience will change both Farhad and Daniel.'Crash' is a study in contrasts. The same bigoted Graham, who has been so nasty in the earlier episode, in a twist of fate, is drawn to the accident site where Christine is trapped in her vehicle. Graham valiantly and showing no concern for his own life pulls a hysterical Christine, who has recognized him, from the wreckage.The film has an unique texture as it build layer upon layer on all what we are watching, enriching the it as the multiple stories succeed one another.Mr. Haggis triumph lays in the excellent performances he has obtained from the wonderful cast put together. Don Cheadle makes another magnificent appearance as Graham. Mr. Cheadle, who helped produced the film, has another opportunity in which to shine.Terrence Howard as the cowardly Cameron shows he has a tremendous range as he goes from one extreme to another. Mr. Howard, one of the best actors around shows why he is one of the best in the business. Thandie Newton is also good as Christine, a woman who can't understand her husband and resents his lack of courage. Matt Dillon as the prejudiced policeman has the best opportunity of his career in a short, but quite excellent role.Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillipe, Loretta Devine, Michael Pena, William Fichtner, Larenz Tate, Shaun Toub, among others do amazing ensemble work under the inspired direction of Mr. Haggis.This is an important film that shows us how each one of us is directly affected by bias and prejudice. Mr. Haggis triumphs in that he is not preachy, but point out to what he sees wrong with our society.",10,7,19,26 May 2005
Closer," Far
","Somehow this film feels cold as one watches it unfold on the screen. Since this is not a story told in a linear manner, it confuses a lot of viewers, as the action switches back and forth. Mike Nichols is a director that has contributed a lot to the movies. He has an eye for what works and what doesn't. One suspects the problem with the film not being so accessible to everybody, lies in Patrick Marber's adaptation of his play. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.When 'Closer' played on Broadway, it had a stellar cast. Perhaps, the weakest link in the film is Anna. As played by Julia Roberts, this is a woman who is an enigma, at best. One is never sure where she stands at any given moment. Anna, is a successful photographer, but her life is a mess. She is divided between Dan, the obituary writer that wants to be a novelist, and Larry, the doctor who falls in love with her, but who has a streak of sadism within him. Anna is ultimately her own victim for staying in a marriage that will destroy her in the long run. Then there is Alice. When we first see her at the beginning of the film, she is walking in a crowded London street. Dan, the writer, is walking in the opposite direction, also surrounded by a lot of people. We know right away these two are going to meet, not realizing yet, they really don't know one another. Alice is hit by a taxi when she, obviously confused by the London traffic, has looked in the opposite direction in order to cross the street. Dan comes to help her. He ends up falling in love with her.At the end of the film we also watch Alice, this time in New York. She is walking among a crowd in Manhattan and men keep ogling at her. What happens next, no one can see in the film, but it seems that Alice is going to try to walk as though she is still living in London. A fatal mistake!Larry, the man in love with Anna, is also a troubled soul. He loves to chat with unknown persons in the internet. In fact, that's how he meets Anna, when he is misdirected to a date at the Acquarium. Larry is a sensual man whose desires are not satisfied by Anna. He must look for excitement wherever he can get it. That's why when he meets Alice, who is now on her own working as an exotic dancer in a stripper's club, Larry's wants to have sex with her, but the young woman proves to be a tease who will not go to bed with him. Larry confesses to Anna his indiscretions and how he had sex in New York on a business trip. Larry is the only one that achieves some sort of normalcy with Anna.Dan is also a man that having found happiness with Alice, courts disaster in going for Anna. He betrays Alice in such a shameful way that makes us questions us his motives. He is a man who doesn't know what he wants. He had happiness, but let it go from his fingers in pursuit of Anna, who at the end, rejects him. When Dan questions Alice about her life in the States, she tells him she is just a plain nobody named Jane Jones, but in Dan's mind, she is lying. The truth comes out as she passes the customs area on her return to New York.The film has a terrific star turn by Clive Owen. He is the one that comes out the best of all four actors because even though he plays the worst possible character, he makes a splash of it, in sharp contrast to the rest of the cast, with the only exception of Natalie Portman. Ms. Portman shows a vulnerable side to her Alice. Jude Law is not likable in his role and he is running the risk of overexposure in films. Julia Roberts is good in light comedy, but in a serious drama like this, shows a disadvantage that is notable.Mike Nichols has created the right atmosphere for the movie. His choice of music is excellent as well, but one wonders if this is one of the best films of the year, why does it feel shallow in the final analysis.",8,3,7,20 December 2004
Elf," Toy maker
","'Elf' directed by Jon Favreau turned out the other night on a cable channel. Not having see this popular film before, we decided to take a look. Frankly, it was a pleasant surprise. The film, written by David Barenbaum, takes great pleasure in bringing together the unreal world of Santa Claus and his helpers, the elves, with present day Manhattan. What a ride are we in for! As played by Will Ferrell with deadpan manner, Buddy, the elf of the story is wiser than some of the people he meets along the way. The encounter with a father, Walter, he didn't know until now, is at the center of the story. The jaded city people are not ready for this childlike figure that is all kindness. James Caan, an otherwise intense type, makes a great contribution to the film. Mr. Favreau gets good performances from his talented cast.'Elf' will be appreciated not only by children, but those young at heart who will have a great time watching the film.",7,2,3,2 June 2005
Capote," In cold blood
","Director Bennet Miller's 'Capote' is a film that shows great intelligence in the way it captured the essence of Truman Capote, a man who achieved fame and notoriety with most of the fiction he wrote. This film concentrates in the period of his life in which he got obsessed by a notorious murder case of the fifties about the murder of a family in Kansas.Dan Futterman has written the screen play based on the book by Gerald Clarke. The film is an account about the writing of the novel 'In Cold Blood' that showed how the two young men who committed the heinous crime are caught, processed and hanged for their actions.If you haven't watched the film, perhaps you would like to stop here.When the film opens we get a vision of a lonely house in the distance. This being the Midwest, we are given a flat expanse devoid of elevations anywhere. The camera takes us to that lonely house as a young woman comes calling for her friend that lives in there. Not getting any response, she goes in to a room upstairs where she discovers her friend has been killed. The colors are dark, as is the tone of the film.Truman Capote, who had been connected to the New Yorker magazine, sees the article in the N.Y. Times and gets interested. This case that shocked the country, at the time, shows a promise for the writer. The next time we meet him, he is in the small town in Kansas accompanied by his good friend and steadying influence, Nell Harper Lee, a writer.By becoming friendly with the sheriff's wife, Mr. Capote gets a privilege by having access to the two murderers. Truman is clearly deeply affected by his relationship with Perry Smith, a handsome dark man who shows a lot of intensity. By gaining their trust, Capote is able to put together his best selling book 'In Cold Blood', which will revolutionize American letters in the way the two criminals are portrayed.Truman Capote, while pursuing the completion of his book, doesn't come clean to Perry Smith. In fact, when questioned about things he has learned, Capote gives evasive answers because he is not prepared to share with his main subject things that clearly should have been clarified from the start.Watching the brilliant take of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Truman Capote on the screen, brought to mind another great actor, Meryl Streep, who like Mr. Hoffman is a chameleon in the interpretation of a character. Mr. Hoffman is perfect as the writer because he has captured every mannerism and the speech inflection of Truman Capote. Catherine Keener is perfect as Nelle, the true friend and companion. Bruce Greenwood plays Truman Capote's companion Jack Dunphy. Chris Cooper is totally wasted as Sheriff Dewey.Adam Kimmel excellent cinematography contributes to the atmosphere the director gave the film because of the use of muted colors in what appear to be the bleak winter of the Midwest.",8,84,126,7 October 2005
Lost in Translation," Sleepless in Tokyo
","What happens when one arrives in Tokyo after an extremely from a long flight? Either one goes to sleep, or one ends up with a severe case of insomnia, as Bob Harris, finds out to be the case. What does one do when one is trying to catch up on some badly needed sleep in a foreign hotel? One watches television. But what if the language is Japanese and one can't comprehend a word of what is being said? One heads for the bar, if it is open, and proceed to get drunk and get into trouble...Such is the premise of Ms Coppola's incredible incisive film. It's curious how she has gotten inside the character of Bob Harris. She knows him very well. It is to her credit that she has balanced all the right elements to come out with this magnificent film that has a look of someone with a lot of film experience behind.I was not a fan of her previous film, The Virgin Suicides, but this one has its heart in the right place. She really knows what she is doing, which, for a second time film director to have achieved, it's a lot.Ms Coppola has been able to get magnificent performances from her two principal actors: Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson. Bill Murray, above all is perfection personified. His take on this has been Hollywood actor, Bob Harris, is so true that it hurts. There are layers upon layers that Mr. Murray brings to his portrayal of this lonely man who has seen better days, and now has to go make commercials in Japan to make a living since probably no one at home remembers him.On the other hand, the Charlotte of Scarlet Johansson is a triumph as well for this young actress. She exudes such an intelligence that one might think she is a much older person than what she really is. She is in a hopeless situation married to a photographer who obviously is in his own little world to realize what a precious gift he has in his wife. It is inevitable that these two lost souls are drawn into each other in this strange place where they don't seem to even fit. The film is a bittersweet comedy. Bob and Charlotte communicate in ways they don't seem to be able to talk with their own spouses. The attraction is mutual. One can see they belong together despite the age difference. At the end there is a hint that maybe they will be united after all.Ms Coppola's view on the culture differences are hysterical. Her take on the Japanese may not be politically correct, but it makes a lot of sense in the context of having the tables turned on the Americans that are in that country making millions, and never taking a moment to try to understand what is in front of them. It is only Charlotte who shows a spirit of adventure in enjoying the magnificent scenery of Kyoto and other religious sites in Tokyo.Great things are in store for the viewer in future films directed by Sofia Coppola, I am sure.",10,80,141,25 September 2003
The Devil Wears Prada," Fashionistas from hell
","Having read Lauren Weisberger's novel when it first came out, didn't leave this viewer with a desire for watching the movie version of this tale of the people in the trendy media business that creates such a need for certain section of the population to run and buy all the latest designers' creations. One must say, that when the offer to borrow the DVD, presented an opportunity to compare the book with what comes out in the film.David Frankel follows the screen play that was put together by Ms. Weisberger and Aline Brosh McKenna, and keeps the essence of the book much intact. The finished product will baffle people outside the realm of fashion since it capitalizes on name dropping and inside jokes. The idea of a powerful woman, who is so self centered, she forgets what reality is like, shows us a world in which the idea of having the latest gives a person some value in life just by wearing what's in vogue at the moment.Meryl Streep is basically the whole reason for watching the film. As the tyrannical Miranda Priestly, she is worth the price of admission, or rental. Ms. Streep never raises her voice in order to get her point across. Her Miranda shows a cruelty beyond belief, yet, her own life is a mess. Miranda would be the last person to be a role model to imitate. Miranda is basically a self-made woman who probably came out of the same background of the young assistants she loves to terrorize, belittle and make them feel inadequate. Miranda can dictate to others, but she can't do anything to save her own marriage.Anne Hathaway surprises in her role of Andy Sachs. Never has she been so beautifully presented in any film she has appeared. She seems to be a natural who carries herself well against the rest of the people in the magazine. Emily Blunt is another asset. Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker, and the rest of the cast do a good job for the director.",7,10,15,15 May 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne again
","If anyone is looking how to spend a couple of hours with a fast action film, they should look no further than to 'The Bourne Ultimatum'. Based on the Robert Ludlum novel, this is a movie that will not disappoint fans of the genre, or thrill seekers all over the world.The film, directed by Paul Greenglass, takes us on a fast ride through several cities following CIA renegade operative Jason Bourne, who wants to find out his true identity. In the process, he will be chased by the same organization responsible for his own creation. The adaptation by Tony Gilroy, who also contributed to the two prior screen treatments of the saga, and the superb 'Michael Clayton', offers an interesting premise for this movie. George Nolfi and Scott Z. Burns also worked in the screenplay.Jason Bourne is one of those movie characters that are larger than life. He proves that he is always one step ahead of the same people that gave him a taste for the job he was trained to do. Bourne problems begins when he wants to meet with a journalist from the English newspaper 'The Guardian'. The CIA chief, Noah Vosen, has other ideas in mind. He sends a team of killers to take care of Bourne at the busy Waterloo railway station in London. From that moment on, the film doesn't stop one moment to let the viewer catch his breadth.Matthew Damon is well suited to portray Jason Bourne. This is an actor that is not as effective in other types of roles, but as an action hero, he looks unflappable. Nothing seems to bother him during some difficult moments where he has to fight all kinds of danger. David Strathairn, one of the best character actors of this generation, is excellent as the malevolent Vosen. This actor projects such malice with flair and style. Joan Allen, another excellent actress, doesn't have much to do in this version of the Bourne saga, but she has a pivotal role in helping Bourne achieve his goal. The rest of the cast, Julia Stiles, Scott Glenn, Paddy Considine, and even the great Albert Finney, have limited screen time.The cinematography is by Oliver Wood, a good man to have behind the camera. His work is impeccable in whatever location the action takes place. Christopher Rouse's Academy Award winning editing enhances this film. John Powell's musical score greatly contributes to our enjoyment. Ultimately, all praise must go to Paul Greenglass whose intelligent approach makes this an action film that will stay in the viewer's mind long after it had finished.",8,0,1,12 December 2008
Fargo," Paul Bunyan territory
","Joel Coen the director of 'Fargo', proves he is one of our best directors with this tale of deception and murder told in a style that takes humorous turns in the action. 'Fargo' is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.The supporting cast of 'Fargo' is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country.'Fargo' is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen.",10,90,144,31 January 2006
The Bourne Identity," We'll always have Paris
","Doug Liman is a fine director of thrillers, as demonstrated here. This is one of the fastest action films in a while. The story is somewhat muddy with all the turns and twists. Some readers at IMDB have compared it to Spy Games, which pales in comparison to this film. That other film had two actors that are an enigma: Brad Pitt and Robert Redford! The Bourne Identity gives us another wooden actor: Matt Damon, who is the best example of a bad actor with the right connections. He's always in the right place at the right time. Mr. Damon keeps turning up like a bad penny in Hollywood films when there are better actors who are having a hard time paying their bills.Take the case of the character actors of this film: Chris Cooper, Clive Owens and Brian Cox, to name only 3! They don't have anything to do here. It is a shame they are hired to be in the background of a non-actor.
I wonder if anyone that saw this film could explain to me how is it that what the main character goes thru' and doesn't even get a scratch to his face. I guess the studio executives expect us to grin and bear it and justify what we see as a fantastic agent who is super-human.In the love sequences there are no chemistry between Ms. Potente and Damon. Run Marie, run from this sucker. Make better adult oriented films in Germany or wherever, but never pair against Mr. Damon again.Sorry Mr. Liman, better luck next time and better actors too. You certainly know the business of entertaining an audience.",7,4,8,11 July 2002
The Italian Job," The original was better.
","Hollywood doesn't learn its lesson very well. This remake of the original English film with Michael Caine and Noel Coward, among others, should have been left alone, as it suffers in the translation to the American screen big time.This film also points out how can a great actor of the stature of Edward Norton, work so differently with two directors. In the 25th Hour', he gives a great performance under Spike Lee's direction. Here, evidently surrounded by such mediocrity and directed without any spark by F. Gary Gray, he acts by the numbers. His being in this film was the only reason I adventured to go, in spite of reports of his conflict with this production. It is very noticeable how bad things must have been on that set.As capers on screen go, this one is only about car and helicopter chases. It just doesn't add anything to the genre. It also suffers from Mark Wahlberg's almost expressionless approach to this 'genius' he is supposed to be within the gang. He exudes such blankness about himself that it's surprising that he is constantly cast in these types of roles where he could be more effective in another type of film.",6,2,3,12 June 2003
Radio," On the air
","Can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a South Carolina town? The answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap, James Kennedy, understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene. Also, the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart.'Radio', directed by Michael Tolllin, is a formula film inspired on a true story. Yet, the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast.Coach Jones is instrumental in getting the young man, who is called Radio because his passion for collecting them, involved in sports, a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life. Coming from a poor background, Radio, lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions. Radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot, at first, then, his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body.The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. who make a great pair as the coach and Radio. Mr. Harris, one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence. He gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past. Cuba Gooding Jr. is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man.The supporting cast is excellent. S. Ephata Merkerson, one of the best actresses of her generation, does interesting work as the mother of Radio. Alfre Woodard, another good actress plays the high school principle with style. Debra Winger, only has a few scenes in the film.'Radio', while being sentimental, will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them. Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us.",7,16,22,5 February 2006
Cold Mountain," Tintypes
","This Miramax film epic, directed by Anthony Minghella, will, no doubt, be hyped to the heavens by the studio in order for it to garner as many prizes as possible. Comments from viewers in this forum seem to indicate they love the film, which, at first glance has all the qualities to merit them. However, this Civil War story of romance in the midst of conflict, feels empty as soon as it ends. This film doesn't stay in one's memory for a lot longer than its 155 minutes of projection.Inman and Ada love affair is a bit a bit far fetched. Not only do they come from different backgrounds, but they don't appear to have anything in common. In the South of before the Civil War, with its class distinctions, Ada and Inman wouldn't have had a chance, let alone, have the long distance love affair that seems to hold the narrative.The other problem the film has is the many fake Southern accents, which is understandable when an international cast has been assembled to recreate the same Southerners that wouldn't probably understand what they're talking about. After all is said and done,  Ada only gets to keep Inman's image in the tintype picture he gives her, and as another Southern heroine, Scarlet O'Hara, she will survive the tragedy and come out ahead of the game.",8,2,3,1 January 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," The road to Redondo Beach
","I don't know why, but the tragic image of JonBenet Ramsey came to mind as I watched this acerbic commentary in the way children are exposed to an early age to the fantasy and phony world of beauty pageants. Imagine our shock when that same night we heard about the capture of the murderer of the little girl, ten years after she suffered a death she didn't deserve.But, we are getting side tracked here. Although the competition for Miss Little Sunshine is at the center of this film, the movie is a sad commentary on the American family. To say that this family is dysfunctional, is to put it mildly. After all, both parents work for a living. That leaves little Olive and Dwayne without real supervision at home. The grandfather, although well meaning, has a bigger problem of his own, he is a drug user! Right by watching at the earthy Olive, one realizes, she is no beauty pageant competitor. By a fluke, she gets a slot in the competition because another girl has dropped out. Since we never see her doing, or practicing, her routine, we have no inkling as what it will be like when she takes to the stage.To make matters worse, uncle Frank, has attempted to commit suicide as the story begins. Frank who is gay has been abandoned by the hunk he was in love with, only to see him go to another, more famous, and wealthier guy. He is made to share Dwayne's room, something that doesn't go too well with the teen ager nephew. Frank is rescued by the kind Sheryl, a working mother who barely has time to cook the family dinner and has to resort to bringing fast food chicken almost every night, something that irritates Grandpa, and the rest of the family.Sheryl and her husband Richard, are having a crisis in their marriage. Richard, a motivational speaker with little talent, has no control on what's going on in his life and his family. When Richard learns about Olive's invitation to participate in the pageant, he happily agrees to take the road trip from Albuquerque to Redondo Beach, a trip that will, in many ways help him and the family bond in ways they never thought possible.This film boasts two directors. Sometimes, when this happens, the end result, in most cases, turns out to be bad, which is not the case with this endearing independent movie. Jonathan Dayton and his wife, Valerie Faris, have their hearts in the right places, and it shows. They directed with great style helped by the wonderful screen play of Michael Ardnt. It's no wonder the film was loved in Sundance last winter.The directors got an ensemble acting from their wonderful cast. Gregg Kinnear has one of his best roles in quite some time; he shows he was the man for this part. Toni Collette, who plays the grounded Sheryl, once again gives an effortless performance as she transforms herself into this woman. Not having been a fan of Steve Carell, we must recognize he makes a valuable contribution to the success of the picture. Veteran Alan Arkin doesn't have much to do. Abigail Breslin's Olive is one of the best things in the film. She is not bratty or obnoxious. She is a little girl who, like many of her peers, is manipulated by the media business into becoming adults when she should be playing and having a great time with other little girls, instead of being what she is not. Finally, Paul Dano, who doesn't speak for most of the length of the movie is good as Dwayne.The pageant sequence showed to what extend little girls are transformed into travesties of older young women with their excessive make-up and big hairdos. It is kind of sickening seeing these girls try to imitate adults in ways that rob from their childhood. It is indeed, a sad commentary on parents who encourage their children to participate in these competitions.",10,9,19,17 August 2006
North by Northwest," Strangers on a train
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' is one of the best films in his long and distinguished career. Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, 'North by Northwest' was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really happening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of the same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences involving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and Roger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his work with the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grant played, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is perfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture. James Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast is excellent.'North by Northwest' is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best crafted films thanks to the brilliant people that came together to work in it.",10,65,90,30 October 2005
Knowing," Time capsule
","As the story begins, we are taken to a classroom of an elementary school. It is 1959. The teacher, Ms. Taylor, has given the children a project. It consists in creating something, maybe a drawing, an essay, to put inside a time capsule that will be opened in fifty years. Young Lucinda Whelan sits transfixed as she writes down a lot of numbers, while all the others drew pictures of their favorite subjects.The scene changes to the present time. At the fiftieth anniversary of the interment of the receptacle containing relics from the past, the capsule is opened. Children get an envelope from their peers of half a century ago. Young Caleb Koestler is given the strange letter full of the numbers written by the young girl. Caleb's father, John, an MIT science professor becomes intrigued as to why such a young person could have written what appear to be a coded message. What he finds out will certainly amaze and astound him because Lucinda wrote a sort of document that has to do with human tragedies that follow.Alex Proyas made an interesting film in which the real and the unreal live side by side. The story by Ryne Douglas Pearson, who collaborated in the screenplay with Juliet Snowden, gets an excellent treatment by the team led by Mr. Proyas, who is making quite a name in sci-fi features as proved with his 'I Robot'. An inspired Nicolas Cage is at the center of the action. He is a no nonsense science man who knows that '@&%#' happens. This is one of Mr. Cage's best screen appearances in recent memory. Rose Byrne was another surprise. She is convincing as the daughter of Lucinda Whalen now living with her own daughter and who knew more than she first tells John Koestler. Richard Learoy's editing add a new dimension to the film, as well as Marco Beltrami's fine musical score. Cinematographer Simon Duggan captures the fall colors of New England in all their splendor. Fans of this genre will enjoy 'Knowing', a triumph for its director, Alex Proyas.",7,0,1,31 August 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Hasta la vista baby. Arnie will be back again and again...
","As summer films go, this is just about as good as they get. Missing though, was the vision of former Terminator director James Cameron's view on the subject, although this one has enough action going for it that no doubt, Jonathan Mostow will be back, perhaps on a movie of his own, so there will be no obvious comparisons with anyone.If by the end of the film, the viewer is not worn out by this action packed flick, I don't know where was he. Arnold will be Arnold, no matter where he appears. He is his own worst cliche. There are very funny touches in this version, especially when Arnold arrives at the beginning of the film and walks into the strippers joint. It was hilarious. The only thing now is we must wait a few more years for the next T4 film. What will happen if Arnold Schwarzenegger gets the nomination and is elected as governor of California? Will he go back to do another sequel? Let's hope there are enough millions on the table to convince Arnie to accept the challenge. After all, what would be the point of another Terminator without him.",7,0,0,5 July 2003
"I, Robot"," But will the robots do windows?
","We didn't watch this film when it was released but caught with it on cable recently. Alex Proyas, the director, shows a talent for what one sees on the screen. The film is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's novel of the same title, which was adapted for the screen by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, one of the best writers for this medium.The film is pure entertainment. As such, without any expectations, it turned out to be a lot of fun. The story, as these highly glossy movies go, relies a lot on the special visual effects that dazzled us because of what the designing team were able to accomplished with the creation of thousand robots all over the place.Will Smith, as Del Spooner, is immediately likable. Mr. Smith has a way to get the viewer on his side from the start and we go with him for this fantastic ride, that of course, is far fetched, at best, but since we fall right into what's going on, it's easy to see the ride is a fun one.Bridget Moynahan is seen as Susan Calvin, an assistant to Dr. Albert Lanning, a genius whose work in robotics gets him killed. Ms. Moynahan, who was also seen in 'The Farm', is the perfect foil for Mr. Smith, as both embark in the adventure we are watching. James Cromwell, the inventor, is only seen briefly, as well as another excellent actor, Bruce Greenwood, who has only a few scenes in the film.Watch 'I Robot' because Alex Proyas and his team has made it a marvelous escape thriller that will not bore anyone.",8,1,2,25 September 2005
Wanted," The fraternity
","Wesley Gibson is a loser. We watch him at work, where his bossy supervisor, Janice, loves to make threatening demands at Wesley because he is not performing. One day Wesley meets a mysterious woman, Fox, who will change his life forever. Fox is a member of the highly skilled group of assassins that called themselves 'The fraternity'. These people have been operating since ancient times. Now, they want to get Wesley into their fold because unknown to him, he has a history with the organization.The fraternity will train him in all aspects of their deathly trade. The organization, led by Sloan, has a way for reading secret messages that are encoded to old woven fabrics. Whenever the time arises, one of the members will be sent to get rid of that enemy by whatever means. Wesley is finally sent to do his first big assignment in Europe, but there is a big surprise when he finds out who is this person he has been sent to kill.Timur Bekmambetov, who has made a name for himself in action films, is in charge to bring this comic book adventure as a big spectacle for his adoring fans. Based on the stories by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones, and adapted for the screen by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, this is an almost all-special-effects movie. David Brenner, the editor was probably a busy man during the post production of 'Wanted' because of all the intricate stunts the director favored.'Wanted' borrows liberally from other, better made movies. A lot of them come to mind, but we are not going to talk here about them. Best thing in the film is the cool appearance of a tattooed Angelina Jolie, who is the woman in charge of training Wesley and who takes him under her wing. James McEvoy has some good moments as well. Morgan Freeman is the head of the group doing a role he probably knows by heart now.To say the plot is implausible, at best, would be giving the film makers more credit than they are due. We loved the restorative bath where Wesley recuperates from his wounds. (Was it wax? We'd love to have one of those right now!) Best advice for anyone that wants to see this movie is to just go for the ride and have a nice ride. Not recommended for the feint-hearted, though.",6,1,2,20 November 2009
Duck Soup," Firefly of Freedonia
","All the comedies in which the Marx Brothers appeared were extensions of their vaudeville days. In 'Duck Soup', the visual gags that worked so well on the stage are incorporated into the film. Director Leo McCarey directed this zany movie in which the Marx Brothers do their best to entertain their public.There are many interesting moments in the film, but the best sequence has to be the mirror scene in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico, dressed in the same costume are seen on either side of the looking glass following the other person's movements. The other asset in the film is the final conflict with Sylvania in which Groucho is seen dressed in many uniforms while leading the war against the enemy.We had seen this film before, but took another look when it was shown on cable recently. The great Margaret Dumont is simply one of the best actresses that ever worked with the Marx Brothers in their comedies. She is amazing in playing the straight part against Groucho's antics. A young Louis Calhern cuts quite a figure as the Trentino, the Sylvanian ambassador to Freedonia. Raquel Torres is a nice addition to the film playing the exotic Vera Marcal.The Marx Brothers do what they do best in 'Duck Soup' guided by a director who knew what to do with them, Leo McCarey.",8,24,28,3 April 2006
Collateral," Taxi driver
","Los Angeles, a soulless city, is seen at its best through the eyes of director Michael Mann. For two hours we are asked to come along for the ride in a film that will surely please a lot of viewers, while others might think they've seen it already. The screen play has a quick pace and Mr. Mann uses the music intelligently to enhance parts of the film.The big asset for this movie is the pairing of Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Both actors give performances that are amazing.Tom Cruise is the hired killer on his way to eliminate a few people throughout his night in L.A. Mr. Cruise is an actor that excels when he has good direction, as is the case in this one. Also, this actor, like Richard Gere, show their best when playing against type. As a romantic hero, Mr. Cruise can be bland, but as Vincent, the assassin, he is a force to reckon with.Jamie Foxx is excellent. He holds his own against Mr. Cruise and makes the picture his own, in many ways. This Max is a man that has ambitions but has, as yet, to realize them. His mind is in the Maldives resort where he would like to be, away from the stark realities of the daily grind of driving the streets and highways of the city of angels. The rest of the cast is equally good. Mark Ruffalo, as Fanning, makes an appearance that is completely different than his recent ones. This is an actor that always surprises. Amazing Jada Pinkett Smith is also good as the prosecutor who befriends Max at the beginning of the film. She is a lovely woman who projects an inner beauty that is rare to find in other young actresses. Finally, Irma P. Hall, as Ida, Max's sick mother makes the best of her short trip in front of the camera.One final note. It appears there is a trend among production designers to include chase sequences in the Los Angeles rapid transit system, as we have already seen in 'The Italian Job', among others. Yet, for all the turmoil we see, the trains are immaculate and no there is no graffiti in sight. Hooray for L.A.!This is a film for action fans. It will reward the viewer in many ways.",8,3,5,25 September 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Y Alfonso Cuaron tambien!
","The best thing that ever happened to the Harry Potter saga is the selection of Alfonso Cuaron to direct the film and bring the third installment to the screen. Mr. Cuaron is a huge talent, and his contribution to this movie is enormous.Credit must go to Mr. Cuaron in perhaps getting Daniel Radcliffe to be a bit less stiff than in the other two films before. Also, Mr. Cuaron has the advantage of bringing together most of the best actors of the English stage and cinema.David Thewlis excels as Professor Lupin. This excellent actor has never been better and it's a shame we don't get to see him much. What can one say of the tremendously gifted Alan Rickman? His contribution is also vital to the film. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is amazing. So is Timothy Spall, in the small role of Peter Pettigrew.On the other hand, the female roles are a bit anemic. One would have liked to have seen more of the incomparable Julie Christie, who is seen through a glass darkly! Emma Thompson is hilarious as Professor Sybil Trelawney.Let's hope that now that Mr. Cuaron has been found, the producers entrust him with the next films.",8,2,9,23 June 2004
Ocean's Eleven," Why bother remaking this film?
","As it was, the original Oceans 11, wasn't a masterpiece of filmmaking!Whatever was in Mr. Soderberg's mind in taking this project, is beyond comprehension. The plot is ridiculous, to put it mildly. It is very convoluted and just to think this gang could carry it off just goes to show us the arrogance not only of the director, but the whole production company involved with this mess. Are we the only ones to think that Brad Pitt is a bad actor? He just doesn't register an emotion in this film, at all! What about that other over-rated star, turned producer, actor, screenwriter, Matt Damon? He is just beyond help. These 2 actors could improve a lot by taking serious acting classes before they even venture out again. Their characters are phoneys, as they're portrayed by these 2 on screen. The only one that shines in this film is George Clooney. He is an actor with a terrific screen presence and a natural, in comparison with the rest of the others. His scenes with Julia Roberts show a rare chemistry and we believe in their past and present involvement. The rest of the cast is just blah. Why doesn't Hollywood use writers and directors who can give us original stories with plots that can be believed instead of remaking films that had their moment and don't merit a remake in any way, shape, or form. Amen!",7,1,2,7 December 2001
The Duchess," Georgiana!
","Georgiana Spencer, a beautiful English noble woman, and a direct relative of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, was a woman ahead of her times. In those years, a young lady did not have a choice in the matter of whom she was going to marry, it was up to her parents, in this case, her mother, Lady Spencer, to choose one of the most powerful men in the country, William Cavendish, the Duke of Devonshire. All that was expected from Giorgiana is that was to give male heirs to a man that cared more about his dogs than his own gorgeous wife. As their marriage begins, she has to accept the fact that a young girl, Charlotte, an illegitimate child of her husband is brought to their home, without as much as an objection on the part of Georgiana.When Georgiana meets another noble lady, Elizabeth Foster, she learns about what a cruel husband had imposed on her new friend, banning her to see her own children. Georgiana, asks William to let Bess come live with them and get her three boys to join their household. Unfortunately, William sees in Bess a who he wants and makes her his mistress, something that at first appalled Georgiana, but came to accept.Since the duchess could not produce a male heir, William decides to try another approach by raping her. By that time Georgiana had developed a passion for Charles Grey, a beau from her single days. Charles, who was deeply involved in politics, had always loved her, but society prevented them to be openly involved. After all those were different times. As a curious note, Charles Grey's name was adopted to name a favorite tea, the 'Earl Grey' brew, a favorite of many.This tasteful production, directed by Saul Dibb, takes the viewer into the grandeur of the England of the late eighteenth through the early nineteenth centuries in a visually splendid production that is a great pleasure to watch. Based on the book 'Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire', by Amanda Foreman, gets a satisfying production by the director and Jeffrey Hatcher and Anders Thomas Jensen. Gyula Pados, the cinematographer captures in vivid detail the places where most of the story happened.Keira Knightly makes an interesting contribution as the complex character she was asked to play. Ralph Fiennes is hateful as the cruel powerful man he impersonates. Charlotte Rampling appears as Lady Spencer, an iron willed woman who thought her daughter's duty to be married to a powerful man. Dominic Cooper, Hayley Atwell, and the rest of the supporting players do an excellent job for the director.'The Duchess' is a feast for the eyes. Enjoy.",8,1,1,7 July 2009
Gone with the Wind," Georgia on my mind
","This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. 'Gone with the Wind' represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.'Gone with the Wind' brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor.",10,253,318,22 February 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Butterflies are free
","It's clear to see why films like 'The Butterfly Effect' are quickly embraced by young people because the more visual and complicated a movie gets, the more it resonates with a certain age group who will see what the rest of the audience don't.Created by Eric Bress and Mackye Gruber, 'The Butterfly Effect' is a movie that presents a young man, Evan, who has been warped for life, or so it seems, by the pedophile next door, who happened to be the father of his best friend, Kayleigh, also has been abused by her father. The third person whose life changes forever is Tom, who has witnessed his father in action taking kiddie porn movies of his sister and her best friend.As the result of what these children experienced, their lives take a twist that no one could have predicted. Evan suffers from trance-like moments when he can put himself back to a horrible event in his young live. Following all those stories take a little endurance on the viewer's part as some of what we see is too far fetched to be true.The young cast of 'The Butterfly Effect' go through the motions with great relish, especially Ashton Kutcher, who as Evan has the better part. Lovely Amy Smart, who has done better work on other films, appears as the adult Kayleigh. William Lee Scott, Eric Stoltz, are seen among the large supporting cast.",6,1,3,6 July 2006
Meet the Fockers," What was the baby's sign for a change of diapers?
","To think that 'Meet the Fockers' went to become one of America's highest grossing films that came out during the Christmas holidays, is a tribute to the people that had the foresight and business acumen to think they had a sure hit with this sequel to 'Meet the Parents' The director, Jay Roach, capitalizes on his prior work. In this one, by juxtaposing two different cultures, he must have thought sparks would fly all over the place. While the picture is mildly pleasant, it is still not as funny as it should have been with all the talented people he had on board.In a way, it's a sad state of affairs for some of the most best regarded actors of a generation ago to see themselves in this picture. We never thought we'd see the days when a Dustin Hoffman, or a Robert DeNiro would be reduced to playing these cardboard characters, or be in such a comedy that doesn't give us an indication of what excellent work they ever did in their careers.While in 'Meet the Parents' there was a certain chemistry between Mr. DeNiro and Mr. Stiller, there's nothing of the sort in this one. Barbra Streisand is reduced to play a stereotype of a liberal sex therapist. While it might have looked good in the written page, it doesn't translate as anything funny on the screen. Blythe Danner doesn't have anything to do.In retrospect, this picture, like many others, are sold to the public by the well made trailers we saw before the actual film came out. They were much better and funnier. If there are any reasons for never attempting any sequel of an original comedy, 'Meet the Fockers' would be the model to study.",6,1,2,8 February 2005
Before Sunset," Before midnight
","This is a film that has an European look. Director Richard Linkletter has decided to continue the story in a way we can accept it. In Jesse and Celine, he has found an attractive couple who play well together and what's more important, they get our attention from the beginning.
Jesse and Celine belong together, as it's obviously noted in the film. In spite of the movie being a continuous dialog, it never bores, but one can see that the picture is not for everybody. Mr. Linkletter's great achievement has been the fact that he kept it at 80 minutes long, anything more than that would had bored us, perhaps.Julie Delpy has a radiant beauty. She seems to be more mature for her years. On the other hand, Ethan Hawke shows more chiseled features; he seems to be older. Delpy and Hawke play well together. As it happens when people that have a lot in common and where there's a real friendship, these two can stay away from one another, but the moment they meet, they pick up where they left off.Since the director and his two stars collaborated with the screen play, it is easy to see they all were very attuned to the material and it shows on the screen.",8,1,2,24 July 2004
The Chorus," Music of the heart
","The excellent film 'The Choir' takes us back to a France of the past where the director Christophe Barratier and Philippe Lopes-Curval place their story about a school for problem children.In a way, we have seen similar situations where a good teacher is the catalyst for turning around a group of unruly students into good and productive young men and women. Mathieu Clement, is such a man. His kindness toward the children is returned to him by the students, as they respond to the way he teaches music to motivate and interest them. M. Clement has a keen sense of how to deal with the students; instead of the hard line approach the principal, Rachin, insists in dealing with them, he has other ways to make them change.The music created by the film director, M. Barratier, and Bruno Coulais, gives the film the right tone. We also hear a song by Rameau, 'La Nuit', which is sung with such sweetness that it disarms us and get us into the right mood for enjoying 'The Choir' even more.The film owes a great deal to Gerard Jugnot, who plays the kind teacher who sees possibilities among all these kids. His take on Mathiew Clement is the right one, because the children see in him someone that is the opposite of the other teachers and the mean principal. As the director of the school, Francois Berleand does a good job in portraying this egotistical man who can't see what his own cruelty is doing to the young people in his charge.The children are as sweet as one expects them to be. Especially Jean Baptiste Maunier, who plays the young Pierre Morhange. Also an angelic Maxence Perrin enchants the viewer as the young orphan Pepinot. Marie Bunel plays Pierre's mother well.This film is music to the ears of viewers, young and old.",10,68,75,3 March 2005
The Pianist," To hell and back.
","The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.",10,153,198,21 January 2003
Seabiscuit," My kingdom for the horse
","Seabiscuit is a 'feel good' movie. Great pains have been made to adapt the book to the screen. Gary Ross proves he has what it takes to make the translation, as the final product is very good, indeed!This is a story of an underdog becoming a surprise winner, which is a theme that runs underneath a lot of American films. Seabiscuit is rescued from being a mediocre horse into the winner of very important races.It also reflects on an era of Americana when the Great Depression hit the country. Seabiscuit is some sort of paradox of how can losers become winners because there is a great team behind it to make it come true.Being this a historic picture, it has been given a great treatment by the people behind the film. Jeff Bridges, a great, if somewhat under estimated film actor, is the personification of Charles Howard, the self made millionaire who is instrumental in buying a has been horse and turning it to Tom Smith, played with conviction by Chris Cooper, to make it a champion and a winner in the racing circuit.Toby Maguire, as Red Pollard, Seabiscuit's jockey, is very credible as the man whose life has dealt him a bad hand, but encounters his true calling as the person who can lead Seabiscuit to fame. The production has a 30s look that is very well captured. The costumes, the clothes, even the race tracks ring true and that's the beauty of this film. One really believes in what is going on, which, by the way, it very authentically recreated in the screen by the winning production staff led by Gary Ross.",8,0,0,5 August 2003
City of God," The gangs of Rio
","Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out! At least in this film they outshot you big time. Watching this film is difficult at times. The violence is to such a degree, the viewer has a problem seating through it.Director Fernando Meirelles has an eye for realism and detail. The most disturbing thing about City of God is the fact that the killers are children playing adult games before they can be children. It is a well known fact that these kids' gangs created terror, not only in the favelas where they lived, which was unfortunate, but they mugged, robbed and just plain terrorized the big cities in Brazil. News about street children being shot in the streets of Rio or Sao Paolo were perceived as criminal because of the ages, but one can get a clearer picture in this film by coming to the realization these same children were killing real grown ups and getting away with murder.The only problem I had with this film is with the English subtitles. Sometimes, one doesn't know who's who. To make matters worse, the principal character grows from a young boy into a photographer who looks like a small boy himself. The plots and subplots are somehow hard to follow at times. The great accomplishment for the director is that he never preaches. He shows the world what went on at that particular time. The realism is extended to the way we see in gory details the corpses of the slain gang members. If Hollywood would have presented scenes that are so hard to take as these, many would be criminals would have been able to see first hand what bullets do to human beings: they kill!",8,7,12,7 February 2003
Ghost Rider," Faust, where are you? I need you! Signed: Mephistopheles
","Not having a clue as to what this picture was about, and having caught it a few moments after the opening, we thought immediately about a comic book story, something which eventually is revealed in the closing credits. 'Ghost Rider' is about one of the least involving sagas in which Nicolas Cage has been cast as the hero.Directed by Mark Steven Johnson, and based on his own screenplay, the film makes no sense. The main idea revolves around the eternal theme of how a man can sell his own soul to the devil because the asking person wants to gain something he doesn't have, or in this case because Johnny Blaze, who knows about his father's cancer, wants to save the old man. Unfortunately, for the production team, better made movies have been made using this idea.In order to sell it to a wide audience, Mr. Johnson and his collaborators haver resorted to special effects big time. Otherwise they had no movie at all. One wonders how much went into the making of this epic that shows little in the way of a plausible story to fill its almost two hours running time. This picture will be championed by those fans that rely on the visuals in order to anything to be deemed good.Nicolas Cage, who plays Johnny Blaze, is shown with a strange makeup and is always surrounded by fire. Eva Mendez has nothing to do as the love interest of Johnny. Matt Long is good in the earlier scenes. Veterans Sam Elliott and Peter Fonda are also on hand, but they are bogged down by the screenplay that make their characters pointless.",4,1,3,4 November 2009
Unknown," The Eisenhower suite at the Aldon Hotel
","A briefcase felt on a luggage cart at the airport, is the cause of setting this thriller in motion. Dr. Martin Harris and his wife, arriving in Berlin for a biochemical convention, are staying at the famous Adlon Hotel in the city. As Martin notices the missing piece of luggage, he takes a taxi back to the airport to claim it, without even having the chance to tell Mrs. Harris he is going back. On the way, the taxi, trying to avoid a falling object, plunges into the river, but miraculously saved by the woman taxi driver.Martin Harris' troubles begin right away. Taken to a hospital in a coma, he shows signs of suffering from temporary memory loss on the fourth day, when he awakens. Unknown to him, there are people that are interested in getting to him before he can get to the famous convention. A big chase for Martin Harris begins all over Berlin. To his amazement, Dr. Harris, going back to the Adlon, finds out there is another Martin Harris that has an interest in derailing the convention in a daring move that the real Martin helped set up months earlier.Jaume Collet-Serra, the director, gives the audience an entertaining and fast moving thriller, even though it might not make complete sense, but it is a non stopping ride, at that. The film is based on a French novel by Didier Van Cauwelaert, which was released as 'Out of My Head'. The adaptation is by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell. On the plus side, the excitement of the various chases through the streets of Berlin are well staged. The final sequence at the Adlon is an amazing achievement. Mr. Collet-Serra shows a visual style for this genre, even though the screenplay reminds us of other films that came before this one.Liam Neeson has found himself a new persona as an action hero at this point of his career, no doubt because of his good work in 'Taken'. As a hero, he shows vulnerability instead of muscle. Diane Kruger appears as the Bosnian taxi driver who has her own problems, living illegally in Germany. One of the best things in the film is the casting of the supporting roles. The great Bruno Ganz turns as a former member of the hated East German Stasi, now working as a private investigator. Frank Langella does a wonderful appearance as the man who trains people to be assassins. January Jones has a small part as the wife of Martin. Sebastian Koch also shows as Prof. Bressler, the man holding something the bad guys want.Flavio Labiano's photographs Berlin in autumn colors, even snow, taking the viewer to see some famous landmarks. The musical score is by John Ottman and Alexander Rudd.",7,1,3,12 June 2011
The Hurt Locker," War is a drug
","The conflict in Iraq has presented a new dynamic for the United States in they way it fights a war that is being waged on the streets of its most important cities. This is a new type of combat because the troops are on a constant death watch, a peril presented by the explosive devices planted on the streets and on the roads where the soldiers must cover looking for hostile enemies.As the story opens, we are taken to watch how Sgt. Matt Thompson goes to diffuse a device planted on the pavement. The special trained soldier doing this type of job, must wear a protective costume in order for him to get so near the bomb to cut the wiring. Unfortunately for Thompson it is the end of the war and of his life.His replacement, Staff Sgt. William James, is a fearless man. From the start he exudes confidence, as he approaches each task that requires his talent for disconnecting an explosive device intended to end the lives of American soldiers. His team is composed by Sgt. Sanborn and by Specialist Owen Eldridge, who cover up while James goes to do his job. It is easy to understand the pressure the three men face on a daily basis and the dangers they are under. It takes nerves of steel to accomplish each mission entrusted to them as anyone of the curious onlookers could be detonating the bombs with their cell phones.'The Hurt Locker' is one of the most accomplished accounts about a war in recent memory. Thanks to its director, Kathryn Bigelow, this picture keeps the viewer at the edge of his seat because of the action never stops. Ms. Bigelow was lucky in bringing to the screen Mark Boal's screenplay. He was responsible for writing the excellent 'In the Valley of Elah' that dealt also with the Iraq conflict, but in a different form.The film owes its appeal to Jeremy Renner, an actor that gets better all the time. His work in 'Dahmer' was seen perhaps by a selected few, but one hopes the success of this film will bring him the recognition he rightfully deserves. Anthony Mackey makes a good contribution as Sgt. Sanborn, a man that goes by the book and who must be alert all the time to protect James. As the specialist Eldridge, Brian Geraghty does an outstanding job for Ms. Bigelow. Seen in small roles, Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes, do excellent work to enhance the film. The film is triumph for Kathryn Bigelow.",10,11,27,15 August 2009
K-19: The Widowmaker," Undersea Adventure
","This is a very underrated film with a very firm direction from Kathryn Bigelow. This is not something we would have expected to see Harrison Ford in. It's not a very favorite subject to treat on screen since anything other than Mr. Ford being the all-American hero, is not expected of a major studio production. Harrison Ford makes the commander of the K-19 believable. He's a man possessed to do the best for his ship and crew. The submarine was doomed from the very beginning, but still, he tries to keep a sense of dignity throughout the ordeal they have to face. Liam Neeson makes a very good  performance as the second in command. As usual, he gives a credible performance as well as the rest of the actors.The atmosphere of what can be a frightening experience undersea is captured by the director. We feel as though we are there. Nothing seems out of place and what the crew has to endure is incredible.This is a perspective of our enemy in the cold war and how do they react in a situation beyond their control. You wouldn't expect anything less had it been an American submarine commander in this predicament.",7,1,2,31 August 2002
La Grande Illusion," Class consciousness
","Jean Renoir was a man behind this masterpiece of the French cinema. It stands as an anti-war document by itself. The incredible DVD version looks as great today, perhaps, as when the original film was released. The screen play by M. Renoir and Charles Spaak was the original model, which many other films that came later, copied and profited from.'La Grande Illusion' presents us a group of men that come together because of the war. If there were no war, none of these men would have met, let alone, would ever have crossed paths in real life. The top brass in the European armies were headed by the aristocracy. These rich classes only intermingled with their peers; they only gave orders to their subordinates. WWII changed all that!M. Renoir gets excellent acting from the three principals. Jean Gabin, as Lt. Marechal, shows why he was one of France's best actors. Pierre Fresnay, the aristocratic French Capt. Boeldieu, and Erich Von Stroheim, as Capt. Von Rauffenstein, his German counterpart, are amazing in the film.Together with 'The Rules of the Game', this film will always be one of the most cherished French films of all time.",10,9,14,17 April 2005
The Illusionist," The conjurer
","Early in life, Eisenheim understands how his destiny is going to be tied to magic. Unfortunately for the young man, after falling in love for a rich young girl, Sophie, his powers prove to be a failure when he can't prevent the young woman from being taken away from him. Sophie will always keep the locket with a secret mechanism Eisenheim made for her as a reminder of his love.For fifteen long years Eisenheim roams the world trying to perfect his craft as a magician. When the time is ripe, he returns to Vienna to look for his long lost love and to dazzle audiences with his amazing tricks. It is at his Vienna appearances that his fame reaches the crown prince Leopold, who wants to see this illusionist. He is accompanied to the performance by Sophie, who is now Leopold's love interest. When Eisenheim asks for a volunteer for one of his magic tricks, it's Sophie who goes to the stage. Eisenheim recognizes his beloved Sophie who still wears the locket around her neck.Things get complicated when Eisenheim is asked to do a performance for the prince at the palace. The one trick that stuns everyone is when the conjurer asks the prince for his sword, which he makes stand on the stage. He then asks members of the audience to try to lift the sword, which magically remains glued to the ground. Only when he tells Leopold to take the sword back, the sword is released to its rightful owner. That sword will yield a valuable clue to the mystery we are witnessing later on.Eisenheim made an admirer in Uhl, the chief of police who is impressed by what he sees Eisenheim do on stage. Uhl will be the only man who will understand the secret that Eisenheim keeps in his heart.This highly enjoyable movie directed by Neil Burger, is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser. The adaptation by Mr. Burger gets a great treatment for the screen. The film is helped by the interesting score of Philip Glass. Mr. Burger has done wonders with the way he envelops the audience with magic as one watches in amazement how Eisenheim performs his thrilling act. Dick Pope photographed the movie in dark tones that reflect the mood of most of the action on the screen. His take on the Czech exteriors strike the right note. Naomi Geraghty must be congratulated for the editing, since it involves the way the viewer perceives the tricks being done by Eisenheim.Edward Norton gives a wonderful performance as Eisenheim. He is clearly a man with a mission in life and he has returned to his native land to take what he believes is rightfully his. Paul Giamatti's Inspector Uhl has some good moments too. Lovely Jessica Biel is seen as Sophie and Rufus Sewell plays the crown prince Leopold.'The Illusionist' will not disappoint fans of Edward Norton because the good work of the director, Neil Burger, did in adapting the original material for this highly engrossing picture.",8,9,12,28 October 2006
Wimbledon," Tennis, anyone?
","'Wimbledon' was a film that disappeared quickly from the local theaters. When we attempted to see it, alas, it had already gone. This comedy, directed by Richard Loncraine, is of special interest for those tennis fans that haven't had the opportunity to watch the sport at its best and brilliantly photographed. The movie is also a romantic view at the people that headline those tournaments.Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst are excellent as the couple one sees at the center of the story. Mr. Bettany is an actor that is always a pleasure to watch in anything he does. Peter Colt,as played by Mr. Bettany, is the has been tennis player facing an uncertain future of working as a pro in local country clubs, to make a living. He is at the end of his best years, and he knows it. In fact, he is constantly reminded about his number in the tennis ranking that he has to clarify for everyone.Kirsten Dunst makes a great contribution to the film as Lizzie Bradbury, an up and coming American sensation. She falls for Peter, even though he is not in her same league. The sunny Ms. Dunst is an absolute delight in the film. This actress is always a welcome sight in anything she does.In the minor roles one sees Sam Neill, who doesn't have much to do playing Lizzie's father. Jon Favreau, is Peter's agent who returns his attention as Peter's fame begins to shine again. Bernard Hill and Eleonor Bron play Peter's parents.The star of the film though, is the magnificent spectacle of Wimbledon, the best venue for tennis in the whole world. We see the excitement of the competition that Mr. Loncraine has created for all people that love tennis to enjoy.",7,0,1,9 April 2005
Pi," A beautiful mind
","Darren Aronofsky scores another triumph with 'Pi'. We greatly admired his previous film, 'Requiem for a Dream'. The director, writing his own material in collaboration with the star of the movie, Sean Gullette, shows he is a new voice to be reckoned with. Mr. Aronofsky shows he is an original, as he clearly demonstrates with his take on the film.'Pi' has been already the object of many fantastic comments submitted to this forum, so we'll just skip that part and go into the technical points of the film. Mr. Aronofsky has shot 'Pi' in black and white that is grainy as he seems to emphasize in what's going on in the mind of Max Cohen. It works well because using colors would have distracted our attention, perhaps, and it wouldn't have left the lasting effect he achieves with the use of the black and white cinematography.Sean Gullette, as Max Cohen makes an immense contribution to the film, which clearly, having been co-written by him, shows he had a complete understanding of what the director intended him to do. Others in the supporting cast, Mark Margolis, the amazing Ben Shenkman and Pamela Hart turn fine performances under Mr. Aronofsky's direction.We look forward to future films by the director.",8,4,8,28 July 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Big girls don't cry
","If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk, to see 'Million Dollar Baby', perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood is past year.Mr. Eastwood has that rare quality in choosing an odd story to bring to the screen. With this film he accomplishes what could be, perhaps, the best movie about boxing in history. In the first place, the story by F. X. Toole, in which the movie is based, is an odd choice. We have seen, so far, men boxers, but there is a world out there where women boxers compete in this sport that is not well known, or not commonly seen. The adaptation by Paul Haggis is excellent.'Million Dollar Baby' has a rhythm of its own, seldom seen in boxing formula pictures. Thanks to Tom Stern almost black and white cinematography, this sordid world of second class gyms in the poor areas of the inner city, makes the film more interesting in its texture. Enhancing it all is the great musical score that Mr. Eastwood, a jazz enthusiast, has created. Music has always complimented Mr. Eastwood's work, but never in such a way as in this movie.If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.Frankie Dunn, is a man who has trained boxing champions. He is a man at odds with himself. He has demons within him that are tearing away at his soul. We watch him going to mass on a daily basis, but does that qualify him as a devout Catholic? Not according to Father Horvak, who sees a troubled soul in search of redemption.Frankie's letters comes back, returned from a daughter that wants nothing to do with him. Frankie, at the beginning of the film, loses the services of one his better boxers because a richer competitor is willing to pay the fighter much more. Frankie keeps the older Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris employed in the gym because he feels guilty in having let this former boxer down at the highest point of Scrap's career.Into this world comes Maggie Fitzgerald. She is a young woman who wants to make it as a fighter; she comes from a white trash background and everything is against her. The only reason she has been allowed in the all-male gym is because she has paid six months worth of membership. We watch Maggie as she struggles on her own without any help from Frankie, the man she would like to interest in coaching her. Frankie realizes there is potential in this young woman, who he sees on a daily basis practicing, and he relents. Maggie proves she follows his instructions well. Then we watch her progress as she wins fight after fight until the million dollar fight with the vicious title holder.The ironic twist toward the end of the movie arrives out of nowhere; it shakes us up because it was totally unexpected. It makes Frankie and Maggie become father and daughter. Because of the guilt he feels in his own life, Frankie does the right thing in accepting the responsibility of the situation.The ending is the only thing that feels a bit manipulative in the film, although it's handled with a lot of taste, as it would have been worse in the hands of another, less capable director. The only other complain is that Mr. Eastwood speaks in a whisper, which distracts from what is going on, as we strain our ears to catch every nuance of the brilliant dialog. Also, the voice over by Morgan Freeman's character is at times, unintelligible.This is a film totally dominated by Clint Eastwood. As an actor, he brings to the role total credibility as the tormented soul inside Frankie. Hilary Swank makes a brilliant Maggie, the ambitious girl that gets much more than what she bargained for. Ms. Swank has the best moment of her career after her work in 'Boys Don't Cry'. Working with the right elements, Ms. Swank is an actress that works with little gestures to achieve her input in the character she is playing.Morgan Freeman is excellent as the beaten Scrap, a man who 'could have been a contender'. He underplays this character with sensational results. Brian O'Byrne, a theater actor who has been seen in two important plays this year in the New York stages, makes an impression as Father Hovark, who seems to understand Frankie. Margo Martindale is convincing as Maggie's mother.Sometimes it takes a lot for a film to be good. All the right elements were gathered by Clint Eastwood for this movie. It makes one wonder what will his next project be, or if he can surpass the milestone he created with 'Million Dollar Baby'.",10,212,335,30 December 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Broadcast news
","'Good Night, and Good Luck' is the kind of film that has elicited strong opinions in the IMDb forum. In fact, most of the critics point out at the manipulation of the actual events and what they perceive as character assassination of the late Joseph McCarthy and the role he played during the 'witch hunt' conducted by the late senator from Wisconsin. Whether these points are right, or wrong, in the minds of the contributors, most seem to disregard the film on that criteria, alone.In fact, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' shows a time in the American past that served as the model in the way television introduced the format in which the news was going to be shown to the country using the emerging technology to keep people informed. As such, CBS under William Paley's leadership, amassed a lot of talent and it became the yardstick in which other news programs were going to be judged against. George Clooney, in his second directorial job, recreates what he and his co-writer, Grant Heslov, thought about that period at the beginning of the era of television news.The film has a documentary style that serves well to illustrate the story being told. Most of it occurring in the CBS studios in New York during the fifties. The crisp black and white cinematography, by Robert Elswit, gives the movie a nostalgic look to the way things were done in those days. Mr. Clooney has inserted scenes where a black jazz singer interprets some standard songs as though it might have been the next program following the actual news hour, and act as a buffer in the events being presented.At the center of the story is Edward R. Murrow, the CBS anchor at the time. Mr. Murrow was greatly admired for his contributions during WWII and his broadcasts from London bringing commentaries about the war to America. Mr. Murrow was a giant in the field, most admired by all Americans because his integrity and the way he presented his stories, which ranged from the sublime, to the ridiculous, as it is the case with the interview with Liberace in Sherman Oaks where he asked the entertainer about his future wedding plans. The strong cast assembled for the film is excellent. David Strathairn, one of our most versatile actors plays the leading role. His take on Murrow's mannerisms and the way he spoke to his audience in front of the camera is captured with great detail. Mr. Strathairn gives a good performance, but one never really knows much about the man in the way the screen play has been written. Yes, one gets the impression of Mr. Murrow's high ethics, but as far as what made him tick, one has to wait for another biopic to find out.The ensemble cast plays well under Mr. Clooney's direction. Robert Downey Jr., Patricia Clarkson, Ray Wise, Frank Langella, Jeff Daniels, and George Clooney are seen in the newsroom as they portray their models under Mr. Clooney's direction.",8,106,130,21 October 2005

Mulholland Drive," Nightmare in la-la land
","David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. is a rare film that combines the best elements of previous works and gives us a spellbinding picture that keep us riveted to our seats even when there is no action.The combination of the two actresses, Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harding, produces unexpected results. Nothing is so on the surface, or better yet, appearances are deceiving, to put it mildly. There is a very strange chemistry in the interplay between these two great actresses than in many recent films. It was great fun to see the great Ann Miller in the role of the landlady, Coco. She's a welcome sight in the middle of the mystery that we're trying to decipher with all the clues that Mr. Lynch throws us. It's a shame that the rest of the old familiar faces, like Lee Grant, Robert Forster, Chad Everett, don't get enough time on camera.
This strange film was very different from the childish Hollywood fare of late. It's a shame Mr. Lynch doesn't get the chance to give us his vision of his world, which is always welcome by his appreciating fans.A job well done.",10,4,6,23 January 2002
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Friendship
","The acclaimed best seller 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' finally comes to the screen. With a fairly accurate treatment by the director of the film, Mark Herman, the story of an innocent boy in the middle of one of the worst moments in history, offers us a view of what it was like to be in the middle of a conflict in the eyes of a lad who knew nothing about the horrors.Bruno's world, as he knew it, comes to a complete stop when he is informed he and his family will have to leave Berlin on account of his father's promotion. One can imagine how devastating it is for the little one to part with childhood mates. What Bruno didn't count on was the absence of playmates in his new surroundings.Bruno's father has been promoted and is now in charge of a labor camp, an euphemism for Auschwitz, the place where Jews were exterminated. The boy spies people behind the barbed wire dressed in what appears to be striped pajamas. Little does he know the horrors performed in that place. The only thing he notices is the strong smells and the smoke billowing into the country air. Bruno has a first hand look at one of those people when Pavel, a slave-like servant comes to help in the kitchen.One day Bruno goes near the fence of the camp where he sees a boy about his age dressed in the striped garments. They like one another right away. The only problem is Shmuel, the boy behind the fence can't get out to play with Bruno. Their friendship is put to a test when Schmuel, who is brought to replace Pavel, is caught eating a pastry. Bruno, when questioned, denies he has anything to do with it, when it was at his insistence Schmuel took the cake.The boys continue to bond at the remote corner of the compound, both on opposite sides of the partition. Bruno's mother who catches on to what is really going on in the labor camp, gets sick upon knowing the truth. The father determines it's better to send his wife and kids away to a relative to get them out of the way. Little prepares the old man to realize the fate that awaits Bruno when he and Schmuel finally device a way to play together.Mark Herman, the director, got good performances, in general, out of his English cast. Asa Butterfield who portrays Bruno does wonders as the confused boy whose loyalty to a new friend is questioned, but who ultimately does the right thing. Vera Farmiga and David Thewlis are seen as the parents. Jack Scanlon appears as Schmuel. David Hayman, Rupert Friend, Richard Johnson and Sheila Hanckock, among others, do fine work as well.",7,3,5,25 February 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Revenge is sweet
","Wow, Quentin Tarantino is back with a vengeance! Director Tarantino has created a film that incorporates many styles into it, with a heavy nod to the martial arts of the Far East.It was a stroke of his genius to cast Uma Thurman as the protagonist of this tale of revenge. Ms. Thurman has not played anything before with so much relish and verve, as she does here. In this film she continues to show that led by a good director, like Tarantino, can work wonders for her, as it was the case in Pulp Fiction. These two belong together, and doubt, they will collaborate more in the future, only next time, don't show us her toes!The cast assembled for the film is very effective, although this version shows too much of Lucy Liu, who is as blank, as a white piece of paper. Perhaps she should be paired next time out with Keanu Reeves; just think of the possibilities and what a great couple they would make!The master is back, so now, give us Part II.",10,0,3,21 October 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A magical time thanks to Tim Burton
","Roald Dahl's delightful book of the same title gets a magical production by that wizard of wizards, Tim Burton. If ever was a man who was born to undertake the adaptation of this beloved book into a film it was Mr. Burton, a man who understands how to entertain an audience with a good story and great cinematic flair.Mr. Burton is lucky, as this film marks the fourth collaboration between him and its star, Johnny Depp. Both director and star are well attuned into what each expects from the other. The film is a triumph of creativity with a film that will satisfy children of all ages as well as grown ups. The screen play by John August serves the book and the film well.Mr. Burton has given the film a glossy look that is absolutely impossible to be distracted at any given moment. In fact, the time flew by without realizing the movie was over, leaving us craving for more.Willie Wonka, the genial chocolate maker, decides to invite five children for a tour of his famous chocolate factory. From the five that win the privilege, Charlie Bucket, the poor child with a rich family life, in spite of their poverty, is the only one we realize is going to be the winner because the other four display the worst qualities that will surely clash with their host. Charlie, the humble child shows Willie that having a loving family is a treasure that the chocolate maker hasn't got.To say that Johnny Depp is magnificent, is not saying anything at all. As Willie, Mr. Depp has a brilliant field day hosting the group, and us, through his world and his realm. Mr. Depp is an absolute delight to watch; he seems to do everything so naturally that he becomes the real Willie Wonka.As Charlie, Freddie Highmore, who had already appeared with Mr. Depp in 'Neverland', proves again he is a young actor that is easy to like because he seems to be a natural. As his grandfather, David Kelly, is also wonderful. Freddie's parents, Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter are good, and the supporting cast do an excellent job under the direction of Mr. Burton. Deep Roy, as Oompa Loompa deserves special mention as he is seen hundreds of times! Philipe Russelot, the cinematographer does wonders with his camera. The musical score is brilliant. The people behind the production technical part must be congratulated for giving the director their best into making this film, the joy it is.Let the viewer beware he is in for a magical ride thanks to Mr. Burton.",10,17,35,19 July 2005
Black Hawk Down," War is hell
","This film is more realistic than the tepid pictures that were produced  in the Hollywood of World War II. You have to give credit to the director, Ridley Scott, to come out with a winning movie that is totally engrossing and that keeps you at the edge of your seat all the time. The only sad part is that we never get to know the feelings on the Somali people that battled the American power to the bitter end. So in that sense, this film is a one-sided account of what went on, told to us from the American viewpoint, which is well and good, but we never get to hear from the other side, except the short scene from one of the Somali warlord and General Garrison.
This film is released right smack at the height of the Afghanistan conflict in which Americans are facing 'the evil enemy', according to our president. In the case of the Somalian involvement, it was supposedly to help the Somalis regain peace from the warlords that dominated the country. The parallel with the war in Afghanistan is somehow similar as we are still battling the same type of enemy in a divided country, dominated as was Somalia by warlords that are more interested in the domination of the poor and defenseless people than in achieving democracy and freedom for the people of the country.What doesn't make sense at all is why didn't the Black Hawks attack from the air the thousands up in the roof, thus providing cover to the troops on the ground. In fact, the whole nature of the fighting is a bit of a puzzlement because if the intention was to kidnap the kingpins of the conflict, we only succeeded in putting our troops in harm's way and to have 19 men killed, when maybe they would have had a better chance if they had better cover from the same Black Hawks the enemy keep downing. The cast is very good. I never did like Josh Hartnett, and frankly, he is not a good actor. He doesn't show any emotion. The rest of the cast is great with actors of the stature of Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, William Fitchner and the rest. As an ensemble they interact very well and you believe they are the people involved in the original conflict.The gory details of war are realistically handled. The script by Ken Nolan serves the director very well even though, as pointed out at the beginning it's only one-sided, since the enemy then, as it is now is composed of people, as presented in the film, so horrible, they're very easy to hate.In spite to these misgivings, the film is so fast paced that almost 2 hours and a half pass by so quickly, we don't even feel it's that long. Mr. Scott gives us here his own take of the Somalian conflict in very cinematic terms.",10,16,24,24 January 2002
Big Fish," It's a wonderful lie
","Judging by most comments submitted to this forum, this film has become an all time favorite. Coming from Tim Burton, however, the movie doesn't measure to some of his best films at all.Edward Bloom is a dreamer, a quality he thought he would pass to his son, only to find out that it only causes embarrassment in the young man, who has to go through life listening to the same stories over and over again. Where did Edward Bloom go wrong? That point is never clearly explored by anyone connected to this fantasy. Was it all in Edward's head, or was it real? Well, let the viewer follow the clues and let him arrive at his own conclusion to see if this Walter Mitty of a man really lived the lies his son Will seems to believe he is telling, or did he actually encountered all these adventures in the process of growing up.The triumph of the film is the casting. Young Edward, played by Ewan McGregor, suddenly transforms himself into Albert Finney, the older Edward. The same can be said of Alison Lohman turning into Jessica Lange. This was a most felicitous event because in most occasions actors playing a younger character don't bear any resemblance of the actor who plays the older version. In this movie this process seems seamless, as far as how uncanny both McGregor and Lohman might look like Finney and Lange at a later stage of their lives.Since the film is basically about Edward, his wife, Sandra, has very little to do in it. Jessica Lange is totally wasted, or Alison Lohman, for that matter. One would have liked to have seen them  more on screen. Billy Crudup, as Will, is fine. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor are very good playing Edward.",7,1,1,6 February 2004
The Dark Knight," Batman in Gotham
","This new clever version of the Batman saga, sticks into our mind as one of the best realized takes on the comic book hero that has . Yes, Batman is as amazing as always, but he is perhaps more human, this time out. That might be because of the intelligent treatment, its director, Christopher Nolan, working with his brother, Jonathan, conceived as a clever approach to the protector of all good causes in Gotham. Not being this our favorite genre, we gave it the benefit of the doubt, and we were impressed with what we saw. Naturally, the film works because of the fantastic job of the late Heath Ledger, who runs away with the picture. Not to take from the star, Christian Bale, but the screen smolders whenever the evil joker, impersonated by Mr. Ledger, appears in front of the action. It's impossible to take ones eyes away from this actor throughout the duration of the movie.The creators have conveniently disposed of Robin, Batman's sidekick that is absent since the previous installment, thus eliminating the problem presented by was perhaps a gay duo; the new take on Batman makes him into a macho figure that talks with a husky voice, perhaps trying to prove he is not a closet case.The cast is impeccable. Christian Bale makes a great Batman. Actors of the caliber of Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, the charismatic Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the incomparable Michael Caine, who returns as Alfred Pennyworth. What's more amazing is that Mr. Nolan and his team have meshed all the elements and have given us a film that is fun, full of action, and at the same time, it packs a lot of entertainment.Wally Pfister's cinematography plus Lee Smith editing, works wonder in the film. The musical score is by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Technically, the film makes the viewer think how did all was accomplished. It's not easy task to put all the elements together and come out with a winning film this neat.Thanks should go to Christopher Nolan for his vision and a posthumous salute to the great Heath Ledger for what he gave us.",8,1,7,16 December 2008
Into the Wild," Ah wilderness!
","Never read Jon Krakower's book, but nothing prepared this viewer for the intensity of the life it describes. The mere idea of a young man pursuing an ideal such as to be on his own, be self-reliant, follow his dreams, is something no one can easily comprehend. The fact that Chris McCandless, a young man with a bright future decides to leave it all and go search for a world unknown is to be celebrated because of the trappings of this society probably would have interfered in his quest. That he persevered, and even had to pay a dear price for following his dream is almost incomprehensible, given the kind of life and background where he came from.Sean Penn, an uncompromising man in his life, as well as in his profession, shows a keen understanding to his subject's motives for going on his own to discover what was out there and spend his life doing exactly what he wanted. Mr. Penn has given us a work of love and beauty in his screen treatment of the life of a man that found fulfillment in doing exactly what he wanted.Thus we follow the travels of Chris, who becomes Alexander Supertramp as he starts roaming the country. His goal is to get to Alaska, which to him probably his last frontier. Along the way he meets people that will touch his life, as well as his will touch theirs, no doubt. There are the hippie couple Rainey and Jan, free spirits that will get to meet him on a couple of occasions. Farmer Wayne and Alexander find they are much alike when they get to know one another. The most touching person the young man bonds with is Ron, the retired man who feels strongly about adopting him and leaving whatever he has to Alexander, who is not into material things.One sad note is the way Chris rejects his parents. Perhaps he felt his rebellion against everything is because their own sad lives. Not even his own sister, Carine, is able to comprehend her brother's decision to leave them. The family never thought they would not see him again after he leaves home. There are so many unanswered questions in this story.Emile Hirsch, the talented young actor, was a magnificent choice for the main role. He gives his director, Sean Penn, a performance of epic proportions. Mr. Hirsch, one of our best screen performers injects life into the man he was asked to impersonate. Mr. Hirsch runs away with the film.The supporting cast is excellent. William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone are seen as the parents, and sister of Chris McCandless. Brian Dierker and Catherine Keener are the hippie couple that befriend the young man. Vince Vaughn appears as Wayne. One of the most impressive actor in the film is without a doubt, Hal Holbrook, who outdoes himself as the kind Ron.Sean Penn has established himself as an important voice in the American cinema. With 'Into the Wild' he proves he has a great talent.",8,10,19,8 June 2008
Pride & Prejudice," The Bennets
","Jane Austen is one of the best English writers of all times. Her novels have endured the passage of time. 'Pride and Prejudice' is perhaps a masterpiece that is captured exquisitely by Joe Wright, who with the adapter, Deborah Moggach, has created a beautiful film that will live forever.Much has been said in this forum about the movie and how some people feel this new version of the Austen's novel compares to other screen treatment, most notably the 1995 mini series. Comparisons are unfair to this new installment because it should stand on its own merits. In fact, credit has to be given to Mr. Wright for the exquisite treatment he and his cinematographer, Roman Osin, has given the finished product. The atmospheric musical score by Dario Marianelli enhances the film, and the editing of Paul Toehill is great.The only recommendation to anyone is to go to this film without any preconceived ideas. Just take in the glorious colors exploding in the big screen and fall in love with the Bennets, and all the Austen characters that come alive under the direction of Mr. Wright.Keira Knightly is the best excuse for going to see 'Pride and Prejudice'. She is a young actress doing an amazing job with her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet. Matthew MacFayden cuts quite a figure as the dashing Mr. Darcy. The two stars have the right chemistry to make this film a winner because of the love we know they feel for one another from the start.Brenda Blethyn, as the calculating, and silly, Mrs. Bennet has some good moments. Donald Sutherland underplays his Mr. Bennet to give us a man that is out place among all the Bennet women with their conflicts. Judi Dench is seen as Lady Catherine de Bourg, the bitchy noble woman who thinks her nephew, Mr. Darcy is too good for Elizabeth. Her scene toward the end of the film when she confronts the young woman is one of the highlights of the movie, as we don't expect Lizzie's reaction toward this harpy.Go see 'Pride and Prejudice' and just enjoy and absorb the wonderful trip back in time that Joe Wright has invited us to take with him.",10,13,26,26 November 2005
Singin' in the Rain," The talkies
","The transition from the silent film era to the newly arrived technique of the 'talkies' proved to be the ruin for many well established stars that were great on the screen, but who had no professional training in the theater, or otherwise, and had horrible speaking voices. Thus, a star of the magnitude of Lina Lamont, suffers a hard blow to her career and ego.That's the basis of one of the best movies about old Hollywood of all times: 'Singin' in the Rain'. The film is one of the classics it is because of the marvelous direction of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, two men who knew a lot about musicals. The screen play is by one of the best people in the business, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.MGM was the studio that employed all the stars one sees in the film, and what a cast they put together: Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Cyd Charisse in a dancing part, Millard Mitchell and Rita Moreno. As if those names weren't big enough, there is the fantastic musical numbers that even, viewing them today, have kept their freshness because of the care in which this film was crafted.'Singin' in the Rain' is one of the best musicals of all times. It's right up there with the best of them thanks to the vision of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen and it will live forever as more people discover this wonderful example of entertainment.",10,64,80,2 January 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Someone please, don't erase my memory!
","The best excuse to see the film is the tour de force acting by Jim Carrey. He is paid millions to appear in other films that are supposed to be funny movies, but in reality, Mr. Carrey is at top of his craft when he plays against type, as is the case in this film.That Mr. Carrey is surrounded by some of the best actors working in films today, helps to make this  movie a favorite for a lot of IMDB contributors, judging by the hundreds of comments submitted to this page. Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, are very good and very effective in playing the people in the story.As far as the writing of Charlie Kaufman goes, he is never boring. To every new project Mr. Kaufman brings his own fresh ideas on how to present them on screen. He is very lucky to have found directors that are sensitive to his material and do the job well. To have Michael Gondry bring it all together, it's just happiness.The only point I would argue with Mr. Kaufman is the suppression of those painful memories at the center of the story. It is utopian at best. Would anyone be better off by having a bad love affair, or even a death of a loved one, erased from one's mind permanently? I think not. I'd rather remember the good and the bad.",8,3,7,19 April 2004
Taken," 96 hours
","A father's worst nightmare is what Bryan Mills, a former CIA agent, has to endure when his daughter, whom he reluctantly let go on a trip to Paris with her friend Amanda, is kidnapped right after she arrives in the city. The purpose of her being taken away is not for ransom money, it is because this girl is a young morsel for the degenerate crowd that deal in turning these naive women into prostitution and drugs for a profit.'Taken', directed by Pierre Morel, is a thriller that comes from Luc Besson and his factory that churns this type of entertainment for fans of this genre. It is better to leave one's mind at the entrance of the cinema, or in another room if it is viewed on DVD, or another type of format, because most of the action is incredible, at best. We don't mean to say the film is unwatchable, for it is the kind of action film that keeps audiences riveted to the screen. But alas, when not even the first 30 minutes of screen time have elapsed, Bryan Mills has disposed of a dozen men, and he will get rid of many more scum bags before the flick is over! Why did the CIA did not insist in keeping Mills in its payroll is hard to imagine; he is a one man invincible team. In many aspects 'Taken' is a comic book fantasy.Liam Neeson, much leaner than he used to be, appears as the hero of the story. This man is so resourceful that he knows from early on because of his contacts who is behind the group that took his daughter away. He is an action man when threatened, in this case because the love for his only daughter. Mr. Neeson is the whole picture and he does not disappoint. Others in the cast include the wonderful Famke Janssen, Maggie Grace, and other less unknown faces.The editing by Frederic Thoraval needs to be mentioned because the way the action is arranged to create the immediacy and fast pacing that are necessary for a film of this genre. The cinematographer, Michel Abramowicz, does a good job capturing Paris, especially at night. Pierre Morel, whose second venture in directing this is, will go far if he chooses wisely for he can deliver a thriller like 'Taken' almost effortlessly.",7,1,2,26 September 2009
Up," Up and away
","Every once in a while a film comes our way that makes us sit and reflect to what extent the talent of creative minds contribute to our enjoyment, be it while watching a film, or a play, or a concert, or any other expression of the arts. This is exactly what we experienced with 'Up', a positive film that reflects the times we live, and the sense of fantasy in all of us, told in simple terms, but packing a message of hope about humanity.'Up', the Pixar creation of 2009 offers a magnificent entertainment for audiences of all ages. The minds behind this animated film were in the right places as they offered us their view of a fantastic voyage to an unknown world that only lived in the imagination of an older man, who in spite of his advanced age, decided to take the road to the unknown because he is at the end of his life and the world in which he lives is not what he once knew. With the help of a boy, he does what he could not have been able to pursue when his beloved wife was still around. The prospect of living his last days in one of those institutions that cater to the old, the sick and the infirm, Carl Fredricksen opts for an escape. His beloved house serves as the vehicle where he will reach the Paradise Falls in South America. Unknown to him, Russell, the boy scout wanting to get another badge for assisting the elderly, comes along for a trip to the unknown. Little did he know the dangers he and Russell will have to face while at their destination, battling the egotistical explorer that once was his idol. Because of his determination, and with the help of Russell, he ends up being the real hero of the story, having escaped the indignities of the stay in the nursing home.Pete Docter and Bob Peterson directed 'Up' using the Pixar amazing technology of animation. Mr. Docter the director of 'Monsters Inc.', also contributed to the screenplay. It the first time Mr. Petersen, a writer, had been involved in directing. Both men show a great talent for working in a medium that presents challenges for even the most experienced men trying to work in it.Ed Asner's voice is heard as Mr. Fredriksen. It is to the actor's credit to have given his character a human quality that perhaps with another actor would not have the same results. Jordan Nagai lent his voice to Russell, the boy with rare qualities hard to find these days. Christopher Plummer is perfect as the famous Charles Muntz. 'Up' is an excellent film that will give pleasure to all kinds of audiences as it wants to appeal to the child quality hidden, perhaps, in all of us.",10,4,8,17 August 2010
Rio," Tropical birds
","Has anyone ever thought animated movies were easy to make? Well, stay until the end because the six or seven minutes of credits of 'Rio' is an eye opener. There are hundreds of people involved in a project of this magnitude in all kinds of specialties. What appears to be a simple film, one has no idea in what goes on to get the finished product to look this good as one sits in a theater, or at home watching magic happening in front of one's eyes.The magic of 'Rio', a film conceived and directed by Carlos Saldanha, is a labor of love. Mr. Saldanha and his collaborators created a simple story about a rare bird that is in danger of extinction. The story and screenplay was written by the director and six others writers who take us from a frozen winter time Minnesota to the Brazilian city of Rio, as carnival is about to start.The film makes a point about the way the colorful tropical birds are stolen from their natural habitats and smuggled to other countries where most of them are sold as pets. Being kept in cages is not exactly what nature intended for these gorgeous creatures, but that is the fate for most of them, unfortunately. 'Rio' is, after all, a picture targeted for younger audiences. As such, the creators had nothing but sheer entertainment and not social criticism in mind when they set out with this production. The film is light hearted and a joy to watch. The well known actors that lend their voices to the birds are perfectly matched. The colors are outrageously beautiful. The best thing for anyone is to sit back, relax and enjoy this marvelous trip to that enchanting place called Rio.",8,1,1,15 March 2012
The Legend of 1900," The young man and the sea
","Giuseppe Tornatore's work will always be compared with his excellent 'Cinema Paradiso', a beloved film of audiences all over the world. He is a talented filmmaker who has worked extensively in the Italian cinema with success. 'The Legend of 1900' shot in English presents a challenge for the talented director in that it is basically a film with an European sensitivity that does not work too well with a wide distribution. It is based on a monologue by Alessandro Baricco, the author of 'Silk'.Mr. Tornatore's stories are basically a look to the past as 'Malena', 'The Star Maker', 'Baaria' and 'Cinema Paradiso' prove. The director's love for his native land translates well as the setting for his films. Working in his native Sicily makes his films to immensely well felt, something that seems to be lacking in this venture. In this ambitious epic, the director adapted the material for a larger than life portrait of a man whose love for the sea proves to be his own doom. This ambitious canvas does not have the same feeling as his more intimate depictions of a society he knows well.In the written page, the text has an intimate feeling. In the finished product, the film did not translate as well. Part of the problem is the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Virginian, the home of '1900', a man that was born in the big ship. An auto didactic man, he finds a passion in playing the piano as the jazz era begins to make inroads in the life of America and the world. His talent is recognized, but his fear of living outside the only world he knew, prevented his becoming the sensation he should have been by not leaving the Virginian. Not even when he found love for the angelic immigrant he meets would make him abandon the only home he ever had.Tim Roth does a nice job of the pianist. Taylor Pruitt Vince is Max, 1900's best friend. Clarence Williams III makes an impressive Jelly Roll Morton. Peter Vaughn and Melanie Thierry are also featured. Ennio Morricone's music is a bit disappointing. He has done much better in his long career as a composer of musical scores. Lajos Koltai's cinematography is about the best thing in the film. His take on the luxury liner is impressive.",5,6,12,30 June 2012
National Treasure," Security risks
","'National Treasure' is a thriller that was obviously targeted for young audiences. John Turtletaub, its director, has created a film that will resonate with those audiences because of the great ride and the adventure it depicts. On the other hand, heaven help us, should anyone feel inspired to emulate the hero of the film and attempts to do something similar, which in a way, doesn't say much about the security in guarding the real 'natural treasures' of the country.If we can believe Ben Gates can pull the caper, then there's no problem in enjoying this film, which offers an action packed couple of hours that could have been trimmed a little bit to make it even better.Not being a Nicolas Cage fan, one was prepared for the worst, but this is one of the films in which Mr. Cage is at his mellowest intensity and it's easy to tolerate his antics. Diane Kreuger is a beautiful addition to the film that pays well. Justin Bartha does what he can being a computer nerd and pulling fantastic stuff to help his friend. Sean Bean, Christopher Plummer and Jon Voight, are seen in supporting roles.This is a film that will play well with young minds and with adults that will allow for the silliness of the situation at hand.",7,44,54,28 October 2005
Inside Man," The insiders
","Spike Lee achieves a great triumph in this studio sponsored film and shows why he is one of the best directors working today on his own, or in Hollywood. The film was written by Russell Gurwirth. The movie is hugely entertaining as Mr. Lee and Mr. Gurwirth take the viewer for a ride, that for all appearances involve what appears to be a bloody bank heist, but when all is said and done, it was something else, altogether.The first clue about what the 'Steves', as the bank robbers call one another, are trying to do, is how easy they gain access to the place. When everything is set in motion, one expects the bandits to start eliminating the hostages, as one is accustomed to expect from other films of the genre. Right after the robbers stage the plan, the police is set in motion to keep the bad guys surrounded so they can't escape without being apprehended.The man who is on call when the news is learned is Det. Keith Frazier, a man who has had problems within the force. He is assisted by his fellow Det. Bill Mitchell. Although they are the ones in charge, another man, a Capt. Darius is the man who is monitoring the action from a van. Det. Frazier clashes with Capt. Darius, who has no clue about what the others are doing.It's at this time that the bank president, Arthur Case, an older man who is well connected comes to the powerful Madeline White to ask for her help in securing important documents that are in a safe deposit box in the vault of the bank. Madeline White uses her influence with the Mayor, to get permission to negotiate with the robbers. It's at this moment where our suspicions are confirmed about the nature of why the heist.Denzel Washington makes a great Det. Frazier. He is at the same time a man who uses his intuition to try to solve the case, without much success. Jodie Foster makes a valuable contribution as Madeline, a ruthless woman who knows a few secrets about her clients. Clive Owen doesn't have much to do. Christopher Plummer is Arthur Case, the man who thought he knew it all and whose past comes back to haunt him. William Dafoe and Chiwetel Ejiofer, are seen in minor roles.Ultimately, Spike Lee pulls all the strings in moving this story in ways only he could do. The viewer is in for a treat.",8,10,17,29 May 2006
Hoosiers," That championship season
","David Anspaugh's 'Hoosiers' is a film about the passion to excel in sports. It's also about a man's comeback to the game after a rough patch in his own life. 'Hoosiers' is a timeless film that will look good after years of its release because it speaks to us about how someone can inspire a group of people to do their best, as they become confident in what they are trying to accomplish. The film was lovingly written for the screen by Angelo Pizzo.Coach Norman Dale gets a reprieve in life when he is hired to coach the Hickory basket ball team in rural Indiana. Basketball is the game where most people in that state take an unusual interest. Their passion for the sport is evident. The new coach is looked with suspicion because he is an outsider and he believes in teamwork. He wants everyone to participate equally, which doesn't make for excitement in the court. The coach doesn't want anyone overshadowing another, that's why he insists in total involvement. Needless to say, his method clashes with the parents and towns people from the start.The coach's past comes to haunt him when Myra Fleener, one of the teachers, discovers an article that reveals an incident Mr. Dale would like to forget. At the same time, Myra realizes the goodness in the coach's heart by involving the drunken Shooter into helping him with the team.Gene Hackman has one of the best opportunities of his distinguished career with his portrayal of Coach Dale. He is splendid in the film and he wins us with his decency and by sticking to his principles, which he passes on to the team members. Barbara Hershey is also good as Myra, the young woman who falls in love with Dale. Dennis Hopper plays Shooter, the father of one of the kids in the team who has a drinking problem.'Hoosiers' is an inspiring film that ought to be seen by young people because of its message about team spirit and how to interact with one another in peace and harmony.",10,59,65,23 August 2005
Les Misérables," Les Miz
","No one can put the blame on Hollywood for this musical adaptation of the great Victor Hugo novel of the same title, for it was conceived by two Frenchmen, Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil. The work, which started in Paris, made it to the London's West End by a genius of hype, one Cameron Mackinstosh, who gave it a fabulous theatrical production, which finally made it to Broadway, where it ran for some seventeen years.The work was ripe for a screen adaptation, so enter Tom Hopper, who had a hit with 'The King's Speech' a couple of years before, as well as the television series 'John Adams'. On paper, Mr. Hopper seemed the right man to be at the helm of the screen adaptation. The film, unfortunately, has not the same feeling as what was transmitted in the theater. Part of the problem appears to be in Mr. Hopper's insistence in having the actors sing directly as they were portraying their parts, rather than have the music synchronized to the actors who had lip-synched the actual songs.It becomes clear the two principals, Hugh Jackman, and Russell Crowe were not up to the task demanded from them. Hugh Jackman, a charismatic actor who has done well on Broadway, sounded as though he was having trouble with the almost operatic voice, demanded for his role. His voice almost cracks at times. Russell Crowe, on the other hand, is clearly out of his element. The best thing in this version is Anne Hathaway, who makes the most of the material and shows she can sing. Amanda Seyfried makes a nice Cosette. The best things in this dramatic show are Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter.",6,1,5,5 January 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry Potter is a bore!
","I know I'm probably the only one that didn't care for this film, but I thought it was plain boring. The adaptation of the book is just OK and the acting is average. Frankly it's a pity to see all the great English actors in this film totally wasted and relegated to play second fiddle. The effects are very well done, but it's such a conventional treatment of the books that I kept checking my watch a few times to see when was it going to be over. It's very curious that hardly any of the young people in the audience didn't laugh at all. This Harry Potter is very heavy handed and it should have emphasized the fun and could have used a few lighter moments.I was greatly disappointed given the hype in the media, which I'm sure has Ms. Rowling, Mr. Columbus and the rest of the people responsible for this mess laughing all the way to the bank!",4,6,16,28 November 2001
The Happening," The rustling trees
","The tranquil setting of Central Park becomes a nightmare as people come to abrupt stops in the Literary Walk. The wind plays on the trees and there is an eerie sense of doom in the air. To make matters worse, all over the city we watch in horror as construction workers throw themselves from scaffolding to their deaths.The scene changes to a Philadelphia high school where science teacher, Elliot Moore, is trying to interest his students into the lesson at hand. There is an interruption from the principal because she wants the staff to know about the alarming emergency in New York. Elliot and his wife Alma, are planning to leave the city with his friend Julian and his family. On the train they learn that Philadelphia has been undergoing the same sort of problem, a phenomenon that most of the East Coast is experiencing.Although there is no sight of panic, the passengers are alarmed. Alma's cell phone has been getting calls from someone called Joey, which she doesn't answer them. The train stops in a small town in Pennsylvania. The passengers flock to the only diner nearby, where the patrons learn about horrible things happening in the city they left behind. What to do? Julian, who is traveling with a small daughter, Jess, is concerned because he hasn't heard from his wife who was on a trip to Princeton. He decides to leave Jess with the Moores and go on his own. Elliot gets a ride from a strange man that wants to stop at his home where he has a green house to pick up things for a trip West, as all the announcements in the news are asking people to do. It appears whatever is happening is concentrated to the Easternmost side of the country.The strange thing finally catches with Elliot and the people he is traveling. There is no place to turn to be safe. Elliot decides to divide into small groups and try to stay away from the blowing wind. Elliot, Alma and Jess get shelter with one strange lady that lives alone in an old house. Unfortunately, what they feared is getting to them and there is no way to turn.M. Night Shyalaman, the director of 'The Happening' has a passion for telling stories like this one, where mysterious things always happen, as is this the case in this tale of a strange force that seems to come from the trees as the wind plays with them. In a way, it's like nature's revenge for what we humans have done to the environment. The director, who wrote the screenplay, has fallen out of favor lately because of his misfires. 'The Happening', on the other hand, is like a cautionary tale, beautifully photographed by Taj Fujimoto in which the awesome beauty of the Pennsylvania country is at the center of the action. The film will no doubt infuriate some people, but it is not a total failure. Although a bit far fetched, one can't dismiss it completely because it tells a good story in its 91 minutes running time.The best excuse to watch the movie is the work of Mark Wahlberg, who is perfect for Elliot Moore. This actor, usually seen in action movies, proves he is a natural in his take of the science teacher who understands the dangers he is facing. Zooey Deschanel's role doesn't allow her to do much. John Leguizamo, playing against type, has some good moments. Betty Buckley appears as the mysterious Mrs. Jones.",7,1,3,11 January 2010
Mystic River," Three boyhood friends
","Clint Eastwood shows clearly with this film that he is at the top of his craft; he is indeed a very talented man. Anyone doubting about his abilities to produce a worthwhile picture such as 'Mystic River', should be ordered to witness what he has accomplished in this picture.Of course, Mr. Eastwood is greatly helped by the adaptation of the original novel that Brian Helgeland has written. The Dennis Lehane book was a very deep study in what life has given the three original friends in their working class neighborhood in Boston and how they dealt with life, as they lived it.It is obvious the film belongs to Sean Penn. As Jimmy, he went to become a good for nothing, until he wakes up in jail, leaving a sick wife and small daughter behind. After he serves his time, he becomes a grocery store owner in the same area where he has spent all his life. Jimmy is dealt a severe blow when his daughter disappears. He goes to pieces as he finds out that his worst fears have materialized; all he wants then is revenge. Sean Penn's take on Jimmy goes from grief and despair, to cool planning of how to deal with his tragedy.Tim Robbins' take on Dave shows us a tormented soul who has never recuperated from his horrible childhood experience. He is a live wire who will explode at the least amount of provocation. There is a scene where Dave and Jimmy talk at the back of the house where both actors shine in it. In fact, Sean Penn seems more effective in those quiet moments than at the height of his grief.Kevin Bacon, the third friend, Sean, is now a federal investigator. His life has changed completely. He is the only one of the friends that has made something with his life. The ongoing problem with his estranged wife doesn't add anything to the story.The only weak links in this otherwise well rounded cast are the women. Annabeth, played by Laura Linney, is not convincing the way her role was written. Her last scene with Jimmy doesn't make sense. Throughout the film she has been in the background and now, at the end, we are seeing a totally changed woman. It comes too fast for the viewer to adjust to the fact that she has become a ruthless woman. Marcia Gay Harden, as Celeste, Dave's wife, is all nerves. In fact, she probably never heard that song 'Stand by your man'... It would have made sense if she would have heard it and sang it to herself.This was a very superior film done by a very good director.",10,2,4,20 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," A crazy genius
","Ron Howard has given us a film that's so different from the formula-oriented fare we receive from Hollywood, that this film, although studio born and bred, plays very much as an independent film. The madness of John Nash is approached by the director, and the writer, Akiva Goldsman, with great honesty and restraint. The production has a look that tells us we are seeing the events in the life of this crazy mathematician as it really happened. Nothing seems to be out of place here with the right touch of atmospheric detail in showing the past, when Mr. Nash went from being an up and coming star in Princeton to his being selected for the Nobel prize in 1994, with enough time going into the schizophrenia that almost ruined his academic life, as well as his own marriage.Russell Crowe plays this tormented soul with utter understanding of the man he is portraying. At no time does he strike a false note or gets too carried away with his own acting. That shows a firm hand by Mr. Howard, whose command seems to be behind every shot of this film. Ed Harris is one of the best actors around and let no one tell you otherwise. He expresses so much with the simplest gestures any actor can make. His kind of acting is seamless from film to film. Here he gives a great and understated performance as the man in John Nash's nightmares and make-believe world.The biggest surprise though, is Jennifer Connelly. She demonstrates here as well as in previous work, mainly her previous work in Requiem of a Dream, that she is in a league of her own. She's that rare breed of actresses that go from film to film acting in roles that she disappears into without any fanfare or hype. Congratulations to Mr. Howard for this film.",9,39,58,18 January 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Beautiful assassins for hire, will work to kill, but won't do windows!
","Doug Liman the talent behind 'Swingers', 'Go', 'The Bourne Identity', among others, scores a coup with 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith'! Mr. Liman shows he has what it takes to direct intelligent and entertaining films such as this one. The screen play by Simon Kinberg keeps the viewer glued to the seat. This is a film that arrives with a built in publicity that has been generating the kind of excitement from all the tabloids as the rumors, true, or false, of the romance of the two beautiful stars, were the talk of the gossip columns. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are actors that are not only photogenic, both radiate sex appeal all over the place. In their scenes together one can't take one's eyes from them for fear one might lose something important.'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is a good summer film in which to get lost. The story about these two agents, working for two different outfits that are going after one another is a good way to spend a couple of hours at the movies. The film will not disappoint the action fans that will surely flock to watch this amazing new film.Angelina Jolie is a fine actress who commands our attention at all times. Brad Pitt is an actor that excels under good direction. Adrian Brody is seen in the pivotal part of Benjamin and Kerry Washington also shines as Jazmin.Doug Liman does it again!",8,7,17,10 June 2005
Psycho," Hitchcock at his scariest
","'Psycho', the Hitchcock masterpiece of 1960, is still a scary ride. TCM presented it on Halloween night, which was an appropriate way to add to all the horror being shown on television.As the film opens, we are treated to Saul Bass' titles that herald some of what one is expecting will come in the film. Then, one hears the magnificent opening bars of Bernard Herrmann's music score and one realizes this is not an ordinary movie. The crisp black and white cinematography by John Russell, as well as the intelligent editing by George Tomasini, surpass any doubt this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Of course, the film owes a debt to Joseph Stefano who adapted the Robert Bloch novel, in which the movie is based, with great flair.'Psycho' works because of the wonderful cast assembled for the movie. Anthony Perkins was an actor who could play anything. His range was enormous, as he shows in the film. His Norman Bates shows a man that appears to be in complete control of himself. We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done. Alas, she was not going to make good on her resolve.The supporting cast is also interesting. Martin Balsam plays the private detective well. He is instrumental in cracking Norman's confidence, but of course, it comes with a high price he must pay for trying to shake the sick man. Vera Miles and John Gavin are seen as Marion's sister and boyfriend.'Psycho' will remain an exercise in horror by a man who knew how to scare us, Alfred Hitchcock!",10,11,20,1 November 2005
Love Actually," One wedding and one funeral.
","This is a minor Richard Curtis' film, but if one is in the mood for something light, this is the movie to watch. Director Curtis has assembled an incredible array of British stars to create a film where everyone is about 6 degrees separated from the next person all the time.We have to congratulate Mr. Curtis for his musical ear, as he has selected great songs for the soundtrack. No other recent movie can flaunt a better array of love melodies to accompany the action in the film.Being this an ensemble piece, no one actor has a bigger role than another, but Hugh Grant certainly steals the film as the befuddled P.M. at the center of the action. In these troubled times, he would be a welcome influence to lead the world.",7,2,6,22 November 2003
Man on Fire," Driving Miss Pita
","Maybe because director Tony Scott's background, this film, at times, feels and has the look of a dramatic musical video, or maybe a commercial for weapons of local destruction. The script by Brian Helgeland, the adapter of Mystic River, doesn't live to the original novel in which the movie is based on. This tale of kidnapping and revenge gone wrong, will please a lot of people, but when one sits down to analyze the plot, a lot of things are not clearly answered. We know that Creasy, the new body guard has a drinking problem. He likes his Jack Daniel more than he likes himself, or the young girl he is hired to protect. Gradually, he warms to Pita, who adores him instantly. When he is wounded in the kidnapping attempt, Creasy gets his act together and he is ready to kick ass. Only at that point the film comes alive.Mr. Washington's scenes with Dakota Fanning, the precocious actress who plays Pita, are very well done. They are probably playing themselves pretending to be in a movie. Miss Fanning is an amazing girl, much older and wiser than her 9 years seem to indicate.In the film the bad guys are Mexican. It's ironic that at the end, Mr. Scott has to dedicate the film to the wonderful and magical place that Mexico is. Sure, if I were Vicente Fox, Mexico's president, or the minister in charge of film licenses, I would have declared Mr. Scott as PNG (persona non grata) and would have made him pack up his gear and go north of the border to get the baddies, pimps and prostitutes and make his film in Hollywood spending about four or five times what the film ended up costing in Hollywood South.",7,2,4,31 May 2004
Downfall," The last days at the bunker
","This magnificent film goes where no one else dared to go to show us the last days of Adolf Hitler. The director, Oliver Hirshbiegel, working with a big cast, brings to life the madness of the last days of the monster, as observed by a young and impressionable secretary who witnessed most of the crisis.At the beginning of the film we watch as five young women are brought to be interviewed by Hitler for a job as his personal secretary. Young Traudl Junge is selected. She is a pretty woman who is naive in many ways and probably had no inkling about the trip she was going to embark.The film captures the tragic figure of Hitler as everything is caving in on him and his grand plans for victory. We watch a man at the beginning of the film that is still thinking he is in command of the German forces, but his authority has eroded, as it becomes clear to the people under him the war is lost and it will be a matter of time before they are defeated.We watch the life of privilege the higher ups led inside the bunker. It was a fortification in which all comforts the regular Germans could not imagine existed. We get to know the people in Hitler's inner circle. The Goebbels, both Joseph and Magda, supporters of the regime, maintain the loyalty to the Fuhrer until the end. The scene where Magda Goebbels murders her children is hard to take and we keep sinking in our seats, as we can't believe such cruelty existed. In her narrow view of things, Magda must take her family with her to a death these children didn't deserve.The film is totally dominated by Bruno Ganz. As Hitler, he makes us see this man as he probably was in real life. Mr. Ganz's uncanny resemblance with Hitler is what makes the film works the way it does. At times, Mr. Ganz is totally irrational, and at times, he is presented as a lost man who can't see what he has done to Germany and to Europe and the world.As Traudl Junge, the young secretary, Alexandra Maria Lara gives a subtle performance. She saw plenty inside the bunker and lived to tell it to the world. The other excellent performance is given by Corinna Harfouch, who as Mrs. Goebbels makes us cringe in horror because of what she is capable of doing. Juliane Kohler, as Eva Braun, is an enigma. At times, she is presented as a carefree young woman who might have loved Hitler. Yet, we don't ever know what made this Eva Braun tick. Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels and Heino Ferch as Albert Speer are equally effective playing these two men.The director and his team have to be congratulated for taking us on a voyage to see the last moments of the Third Reich.",10,230,269,19 March 2005
The Last King of Scotland," The dictator
","Most satraps that gain power begin with the pledge they are for the people. Unfortunately, history proves them wrong, again and again. In their hunger for power these misguided individuals confuse what the job entails and concentrate only in taking care of themselves as they develop huge egos that will betray them and ultimately cause their own downfall.Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator, was a man that came into power with the potential for doing good. Instead he went to surround himself with inept people as he eliminated the ones that dared to oppose him. In this fictionalized account of the life of this strong man, there are hints that he never had any good intentions for his country or his fellow Ugandans.The story links a naive young Scot, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, who one day decides as a lark to point to an earth globe with his finger and decide that wherever it lands, that's where he will go to practice medicine. The first time he tries, the finger lands in Canada, but he rejects it, probably as not challenging enough. The second try his finger touches Uganda, a place that will prove fateful for this young doctor.Little prepares Dr. Garrigan for what he encounters once in Uganda. The remote spot where he is to practice is run by the Merits, a doctor and his wife. The town where Garrigan begins working receives the visit of the new head of the country, Idi Amin. Garrigan is obviously impressed with the energy displayed by the general, who assures the poor people he is there to protect them because he is for the people. An accident brings back the doctor to the presidential car. Amin, who realizes Garrigan is from England, is happily surprised when the young man tells him he hails from Scotland.That fateful meeting impresses both men. Amin, the powerful man, decides he wants the young doctor to be his own personal physician. The young doctor is dazzled by the Mercedes that is given to him and how he suddenly is made to be the head of the hospital in Kampala. In the meantime, Garrigan meets, and falls for one of Amin's wives, the gorgeous Kay whose only son is epileptic.Things begin to change and Garrigan realizes he has really misjudged the situation. He starts to see how his protector can really turn against him when he wants out. The bloodbath throughout the country will devastate the land. Dr. Garrigan is angered by what Amin has done to Kay; the cruelty the dictator knows no boundaries.Kevin McDonald the director of 'The Last King of Scotland' paints a realistic picture of the madness during the Idi Amin's regime. The dictator is presented as he probably was. As any man in his position, Amin manipulates the political situation to his own advantage. He uses people to carry on his agenda and when they question anything, he eliminates them.Forest Whitaker gives an epic performance in the title role. Mr. Whitaker, a serious actor who should be seen more often, smolders the screen every time we see him; he is bigger than life! We don't recall a performer that was able to convey what goes on in the mind of a satrap the way this actor captures every nuance of his character. Mr. Whitaker is magnificent in the way he brings this hideous man alive and runs away with the film.James McAvoy, who plays Dr. Garrigan, is also an excellent player. He matches Mr. Whitaker perfectly. This young actor, from whose eyes the story is seen, makes a tremendous contribution to the success of the picture. Kerry Washington has a small, but pivoting role, as Kay Amin, one of the dictator's wives. Gillian Anderson appears as Sarah Merrit and Simon McBurney gives an interesting performance as Nigel Stone.'The Last King of Scotland' is one of the best biopics about a dictator. The combination of Douglas McGrath and Forest Whitaker translates into one of the best films about the horrors of unlimited power in the hands of a mad man.",10,14,18,16 October 2006
Con Air," Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy landing in Las Vegas
","Not having seen this film in its commercial run, we decided to take a look at it. A sad mistake! This misguided project is a good way to spend about two hours watching the typical special effects that are thrown to viewers that want just that: mindless entertainment.Never mind that the plot, as written by Scott Rosenberg, doesn't make one iota of sense. Never mind that the film, as directed by Simon West, doesn't add anything new to this genre. We just wanted to see how this thing was going to end and we weren't prepared for the apocalyptic finale director West decided to treat us to: an unscheduled arrival at Las Vegas strip!The story of Cameron Poe, sent to prison for a crime that even a court appointed lawyer, would have got him acquitted, doesn't ring true. Not only that, but Nicolas Cage decided to play him with a beautiful long hair and a phony accent that renders him totally unbelievable. This predictable story doesn't convince anyone, but we realize it has to make Cameron look good at the end.No wonder John Malkovich has fled to Europe to pursue more 'arty' roles because as the villain of this film, he is a cliché. Steve Buscemi, a wonderful actor is lost in it, as well. John Cusack as agent Larkin is always a step behind where the bandits are. Colm Meaney, doesn't have anything to do. Ditto Ving Rhames and David Chappelle, a genial comic actor that could have provided more comic relief to the movie, but alas, he disappears much too quickly!View the film at your own risk!",4,4,9,19 June 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Bad hair day in San Diego
","The curse for some of our photogenic news anchors appears to be having a bad hair day, or not being suitably clothed with the right pastel colors in front of the camera. Or so, it seems to be the message of this, sometimes funny, spoof about the folks that deliver the news on television, especially in California.Director Adam McKay, with the help of the star of this film, Will Ferrell, have come out with a screen play that tries to make fun out of some of the local Southern California's anchors. They treat the news as entertainment, or so it appears to be the case. One never sees any crisis in their broadcasts, and being caught without makeup, or heaven forbid hair spray, will send them into a frenzy.The battle for ratings is at the core of most of these broadcasts. The more ridiculous the items being given coverage in their thirty minutes format, the better. In fact, the greatest single item of interest for the many networks in the area seem to be the coverage of the birth of a baby panda in the San Diego zoo, where one anchor woman, by accident, is sent by a rival anchor into the pit where some grizzly bears are housed. But never fear, Ron Burgundy, anchor extraordinaire, comes to her rescue and the resulting footage beats the competition and the baby panda takes second seat to the sensational feat accomplished by the anchorman.There are some funny moments in the film, which falls into the gross genre. The sexual jokes at the station, at the expense of the young woman who is hired, are tasteless, at best. The sequence of the fighting anchors in a free for all leaves one of them with only one arm, but before the film ends, he'll lose the other one as well.Will Ferrell, the funny man of the hour, has some good opportunities where to shine; after all, this is a vehicle tailor made for him! Christina Applegate shows she can keep herself going. Paul Rudd is totally wasted; Fred Willard ditto. In some cameos we see by Luke Wilson, Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller, among others.The best way to approach this movie is to watch it without any expectations, as it will probably appear better with that type of viewing attitude.",7,4,9,7 August 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Deadly fiction
","Marc Forster, a man whose work we have admired before, has scored a major triumph with 'Stranger Than Fiction'. It helps he decided to tackle the amazing screen play that Zach Helm wrote for this project. Both men show to compliment one another in a winning film that unfortunately suffered at the box office. It's hard to imagine how the movie didn't attract more people because it deserves a viewing from anyone that considers to be a cinema fan. Part of the blame seems to be the perception that the lead actor, Will Farrell, was expected to deliver a character that was funny like most of the ones he had given in other vehicles.Harold Crick is a man so meticulous he even counts the brush strokes he applies to his teeth every time he cleans them. He seems to be the right person for an IRS inspector. He is a joyless man whose life is numbers and audits. He has an incredible mind for multiplication, and yet, why is his life the mess it is? When Harold begins hearing the voice that seems to be narrating his life, he unravels. Harold decides to consult experts to try to help him getting to the bottom of what he is experiencing. Alas, the professionals he consults, never can give him an answer. It's only when he stumbles into a university professor who, upon hearing a phrase Harold has heard in his mind, to interest Prof. Hilbert to come to aid him.It is at this time that one gets to realize that Harold Crick is a character out of the fiction of a reclusive writer, Karen Eiffel, a woman whose distinction is the ability to kill all her main characters in the novels she writes. The problem is that Karen is suffering from an acute problem of writer's block. In fact, she doesn't know how to kill this Harold Crick, who becomes her obsession. Karen Eiffel's life is a mess. Not even when Penny Escher comes to help her get out of her rut can she get out of her funk.Harold, who finds himself losing the control he has always possessed, is rendered helpless when he goes to do an audit on Ana Pacal, a young woman who owes the IRS and refuses to file a return. Little by little, Harold comes to depend on his meetings with Ana, who in turn, sees all the goodness in the man she started hating. It's when Harold discovers he has found love that he decides to fight for his life and decides to confront the woman who seems to be pulling the strings that make him be who he is.Will Farrell makes a wonderful contribution to the film. Like other comic actors, Mr. Farrell has to play against type in order to show his talent. This versatile actor should play more serious roles and break out of the mold his career was up to this point. Emma Thompson's Karen Eiffel is one of her best creations. She captured the world in which the author she portrays inhabits. Dustin Hoffman adds another layer of texture to the film with his Professor Hilbert. Maggie Gylenhaal seems to be a natural for the sunny Ana Pascal. Queen Latifah plays Penny Escher effortlessly. She's a marvelous addition in any film. Others seen in minor roles are Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce who do wonders with their small contributions.Roberto Schaefer's cinematography offers a wonderful view of the Chicago where the film is supposed to take place. Ultimately it's Marc Forster for bringing all the elements together in this sunny and positive film.",10,10,16,29 May 2007
Kingpin," Bowling anyone?
","Bobby and Peter Farrelly, the directors of 'Kingpin' show a great flair for this type of comedy. Not having seen it when it first was released, we were lucky to catch it on cable the other night, and frankly, it proved to be a happy choice. The Farrellys had a good screen play by Barry Fanaro and Mort Nathan to work with, as they showed a talent for assembling a wonderful cast to make this a winning comedy the fun and exciting film it is.The best thing in the film are Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray. Mr. Harrelson plays Roy Munson, the man who love bowling, but through an unfortunate incident, loses his ability to play the sport he was born to play. Woody Harrelson is wonderful in his portrayal of Munson. Bill Murray's role is much smaller, but he does wonders with it. Best of all is the way we see him at the bowling tournament in Reno with his teased hair in disarray.The rest of the cast is good. Randy Quaid as Ishmael Boorg, gives a funny reading of his naive character. Also the attractive Vanessa Angel plays the woman who has an interest in the game.",8,29,37,25 August 2005
Hancock," Don't ever call him an A.H.!
","Hancock is a slovenly clad man who is into drinking and shows that even though he saves people facing precarious situations, he is an angry man. The worse offense, as far as Hancock is concerned, appears to be calling him a nasty epithet; that will turn this homeless man into a rage. Hancock causes a lot of damage as he go exercising his good deeds. When Ray Embry gets stuck on a crossing rail track, Hancock gets him out of his predicament, and a sure death. Ray is a man working for a P.R. firm who wants to thank the man that saved him by changing his image. After all, he is a genius doing what he does best. But there is a problem in this whole proposition, the moment Ray brings him home for a meal, his wife Mary takes an absolute dislike to her husband's guest.The secret of the animosity between Mary and Hancock is revealed in the last part of the story. It comes as no horrible surprise to the viewer by then since we are all guessing what the secret was about.'Hancock' directed by Peter Berg, with a screenplay by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, is fun at times, but the story is too far fetched to really make the viewer care for this type of confused anti-hero. We don't believe for a moment when we learn about Hancock's past. Will Smith is bigger than life in his take of the comic-like hero. He has done much better in action films before. This one will not be one of his most accomplished times in front of the camera. Charlize Theron does what she can to bring her Mary Embry to life. Best of all is Jason Bateman, an actor that gets better with each new film in which he appears. Of course any Will Smith vehicle is marked by fantastic special effects, and this one is no different. Colby Chamian and Francine Maisier's editing works wonders for the film. We can see in cameo roles the director, as well as some of the producers, Akiva Goldsman and Michael Mann appear as members of the board that Embry is addressing at the start of the film.",6,1,2,31 August 2009
Hitch," Fresh prince of Manhattan
","Not having seen the film in its commercial debut, we just caught with it via DVD. Expecting the worst, 'Hitch' proved to be a pleasant experience because of the three principals in it. Thanks to Andy Tenant's direction, the film has an easy pace, and while predictable, the comedy has some winning moments.Hitch is a sort of 'date coordinator' for losers like Albert, who is not exactly what one would consider a hunk. Yet, Albert is a genuine guy who, without some professional help would go unnoticed by the same women he would like to take out. Enter Hitch, to prepare him to overcome the obstacles that he can't overcome, and even though Albert stays overweight and never gets to master social graces, he conquers us because he is a real, in sharp contrast with all the phonies making the rounds in Manhattan.The basic mistake most production designers make, when preparing locales for Hollywood films, is how out of touch with reality they are. The apartments in which they situate these characters are so rare to find that only by the magic of the movies can these people live in places likes these. Evidently most of the movie people are dealing with fantasy since most city dwellers would kill for spaces so fabulous as the ones they show in the movies, let alone these same people depicted in the film would not be able to afford them.Will Smith is a charismatic actor. He has a disarming way to charm without doing much. The surprise of the movie though, is Kevin James, who as the overweight Albert, not only win us over, but he proves he can hold his own in his scenes with Mr. Smith. Eva Mendez is fine as the main interest of Hitch. In minor roles we see Adam Arkin, Amber Valletta, Michael Rappaport, and Phillip Bosco, among others.'Hitch' is a fun film to watch thanks to the inspired direction by Andy Tenant.",7,10,16,23 January 2006
The Terminal," Airline food at the mall
","We went to see the film without any preconceptions and frankly, once we accepted the impossibility of this situation, we fell right under its spell. Yes, it's a bit long, yet it kept our attention until the end.I have no idea who pitched this tale to Mr. Spielberg. Evidently, the story is a far cry from reality to people like Viktor, in the situation he encounters upon arriving in New York. Viktor would have been held by the Immigration authorities, then processed, and sent to a detention center to wait for his appointment to see a judge, who ultimately would have decided his fate. No one in this situation would have been allowed to stay unguarded in the terminal, as in the case of this stateless man. Then again, we wouldn't have had a film, at all. The screen play twists the facts to adapt the story for a Tom Hanks vehicle.At the beginning it takes a while to adjust to Tom Hanks supposedly Russian accent. The inner life of the terminal is brought to life by the people that play minor roles in the movie. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg make a great team. The director and its star compliment one another. Mr. Hanks is delightful as this man who, through no fault of his own, is stuck by the red tape encountered at his arrival in this country, at the present time. Catherine Zeta Jones' flight attendant is a fake. Ms Zeta Jones makes us like her, in spite of knowing she is as deep as a Danielle Steele novel. When this woman selects a Napoleon biography from the book store, many people laughed knowing a flight attendant and Napoleon are the equivalent of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.Stanley Tucci, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana, add a comic relief to the film.
The only remaining question is whether all the brands that are prominently displayed in the terminal, (this could have easily been a shopping mall), paid the film makers to have their brands displayed  in the film.",9,2,6,1 July 2004
The Queen," Tradition
","There is a moment late in the film where Queen Elizabeth seems almost human when she meets P.M. Tony Blair three months after the death of Princess Diana. It is at that moment that she seems grateful for what Mr. Blair was able to convey to the grieving nation, and for coming to her defense when everyone was down on the institution she represents.'The Queen' is a recap of the tragic week England, and the rest of the world lived in 1997 when Diana Spencer, the beautiful Princess of Wales, and the mother of the future king of England died tragically in Paris. Tony Blair, who had been elected Prime Minister shortly before the tragedy, was the one who sensed what the public wanted from their Queen and he goes against his Queen's wishes to stay behind the scenes and go on with a private funeral. That tactical error on the Queen's part catapulted Tony Blair to be seen by the English in a different light.We are given glimpses of a Queen Elizabeth that wants to stick to the traditions that had been observed in a rigid England. She had no intention of changing for anything in the world, and neither does the Queen Mother. Prince Philip's way to dealing with what his grandsons are going through is taking them hunting to keep them occupied. There is no feeling of tenderness, or even one of love between the Queen and her grandchildren, or for Charles, her oldest son.Queen Elizabeth II has reigned for more than fifty three years. Monarchy fell on her when her father died. Duty weighs heavily on everything she does. Elizabeth, a no nonsense woman, lives in the tradition that doesn't deviate for nothing or anyone. The death of Diana put an end to a life the Queen must have despised for being a young woman with a popularity of her own. Diana represented everything the Queen abhorred so her ultimate demise is a relief for Elizabeth. That is why she doesn't want to do anything for the Princess of Wales because she considers her not a member of the royal family.What Elizabeth didn't take into consideration was the reaction of the English people when they learned about the beautiful Diana. The grief they felt was alien to Elizabeth who had been taught to hide her feelings and carry on, the way it was expected of her. Her mistake for not reading the public's sentiment was something she never expected and it backfired on her.Stephen Frears, the talented director of 'The Queen', is a man who clearly was a natural for the material. Peter Morgan's screen play tries to give us a portrait of a woman in turmoil at a point of her life when the Queen and the royal family were at the center of tabloid scandals caused by a sensational press that saw any opportunity to ridicule the monarchy.It's difficult to imagine any other actress but Helen Mirren to play the Queen of England. Ms. Mirren's mannerisms, the royal way in which she moves to give the viewer an idea of what the real Queen Elizabeth is in real life, is what makes the film to be the tremendous crowd pleaser it is. Helen Mirren clearly understands this woman and brings her to life so naturally.Michael Sheen, who plays Tony Blair, equally matches Ms. Mirren. This is perhaps Mr. Sheen's best role in quite a while. James Cromwell's Prince Philip shows a callous man who seems out of touch with reality. Sylvia Syms is seen as the Queen Mother. Roger Allan appears as the Queen's secretary, Robbin Janvrin. Alex Jennings plays Prince Charles.The film is made even better by Affonso Beato's cinematography and the music score by Alexandre Desplat plays well in the background. Ultimately, this is the triumph for Stephen Frears and Helen Mirren.",10,5,9,20 October 2006

La Vie En Rose," The sparrow
","Edith Piaf's tragic life comes to us courtesy of director Olivier Dahan. Based on the screen play by Isabella Sobelman, we are taken to the world of one of the most beloved singing marvels of the last century, whose unfortunate existence is examined. The film uses a non linear narrative that will confuse audiences not familiar with Edith Piaf's real life. Absent from it, were some of the men that were involved with her like Yves Montand, Charles Aznavour, and her last husband, Theo Sarapo, to name just a few. Of course, in films such as this, and for reasons of length only the essence of the subject is possible.Marion Cotillard runs away withe the picture. Her take of Piaf, a woman whose life was dominated by the intensity in which she loved, comes across as images about the poor early scenes as a girl are shown. Also, she hits the heights when she became an overnight sensation and entered a world unknown to her. A poor child brought up in her grandmother's own brothel, Piaf didn't have anything given to her, except the innate talent for singing. Piaf went from being almost blind to become a French idol, bar none. With her personality, Piaf, who had it all, destroys herself with drugs and alcohol as she became not even a shadow of her own self at the end.Also in the film we see Gerarl Depardieu, the first man that believed in her voice and the potential she had. A complete transformed Emmanuelle Seigneur is the kind Titine, the whore with a heart of gold. Jean Pierre Martins, appears as the boxing champion, Marcel Cerdan, Piaf's true soul mate, who alas, could not share his life with her because he was married. Sylvie Testud is seen as Momone, Edith's sister-like companion and friend.The film will please, no doubt, people of all ages who will see the story of a tormented soul that left us much to early.",8,3,7,6 January 2008
Signs," Phoenix 1 Aliens 0
","One wishes Signs to have lived to the potential it shows in the first part, where we are engrossed in what's going on, scared at times and amused by this mysterious film.M. Night Shyamalan has been very successful in his previous features. This, unfortunately, falls flat just when a very strong ending is needed. Like many other fans, I felt manipulated and let down by this movie.It's very easy to see what's going on in the Mel Gibson's character. His loss of faith, his grief for a lost wife, his fears of confronting reality and moving on with his life. Those things are deeper than what we are let to know, because on the surface it is one thing, but deep down it has nothing to do with the obvious 'signs' of the title. The fact that he's a religious figure is even more confusing. Obviously, he must be a protestant minister, what with the family and all, but there are moments that are puzzling because of this ambiguity. Had this script been brought to the screen with a lesser known director, it probably would have had a more satisfactory resolution, because the ending, with Joaquin at the bat, is very hard to swallow.Let's hope Mr. Night Shyamalan finds his way for the next time out.",6,9,19,31 August 2002
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Three-some
","Something happened to Woody Allen when he decided to abandon Manhattan, the setting of most of his films, for Europe. It seems Mr. Allen has found a new way to leave behind his angst in exchange for a new, somewhat less restrained sexual atmosphere in which to set his movies. This, of course, is a welcome relief. After all, Mr. Allen was getting in a rut with his last cinematic ventures.Every year thousands of young American college students invade Europe, either in exchange programs, or just enrolled in foreign language studies, or just vacationing in the Continent. Most of these kids come from conservative, and in many ways, puritanical backgrounds, probably having no sexual experience to speak of. Vicky and Cristina, two of those students, are seen in Barcelona where they undergo a somewhat sentimental education in a different milieu.While Vicky is less adventurous than her friend Cristina, both will be transformed by the meeting of the hunky Juan Antonio and his estranged wife, Maria Elena. Juan Antonio offers them sex, and even proposes to do it with both of them at the same time. Vicky, a more prudish girl, can't go along, but Cristina, the more adventuresome, doesn't even bat an eyelash when she gets together with him and the former wife, who is game for entering in a sexual triangle.This time though, the principal male figure, Juan Antonio, is an aggressive man, in contrast with other characters that have served Mr. Allen well in his American movies. Javier Bardem proves he can excel when he is guided with a sure hand, as is the case here. Penelope Cruz fares better than in most of her Hollywood previous work in a role that gives her an edge over the more passive parts she has played before.This is not to say there has not been sex involved in Mr. Allen's previous films. In showing a new freedom in how to present it on the screen, he has shied away from all the neurotic men and women that have been at the center of his work. This is a welcome development in a man who has decided to reinvent himself by getting away from his usual playing ground.",8,10,23,20 August 2008
Identity," Finding one's own personality in the rain at the roach motel...
","James Mangold is an interesting director to watch if he has the right material to work with. This film, as written by Michael Cooney, who is really the less talented  of the Kaufman brothers, as we saw in Adaptation, is not for the faint hearted.There are enough gory details to keep the viewer at the end of his seat wondering what new whacky twist will happen next. To say that it is confusing to the average person, is to put it mildly. Perhaps, as some writers to this forum have expressed, it might be better on a second, or maybe a third viewing since most clues fly over our heads not knowing what to make of the many 'personalities'  a person can have and be at the same place, at the same time. Watch out for the Ides of May!Any film with Ray Liotta and John Cusack will be worth the price of admission. They always deliver. Both are in top form here, even though they might even share the same personality. The rest of the cast was good too. It was a surprise to see Rebeca De Mornay in the very brief role of the egotistical actress who doesn't get a chance to star in her next film....The only thing missing was the limited presence of Taylor Pruitt Vince, who has appeared in other Mangold directed films and has nothing to in this one.",7,1,3,1 May 2003
The Ringer," A day at the races
","We watched this film with trepidation. The Farrelly brothers don't actually believe in subtlety. 'The Ringer' has a cast of mentally challenged players; frankly one feared the worst. Well, as it turned out, this is not your typical movie by the masters of grossness. The direction was entrusted to Barry Blaustein and the writing to Ricky Blitt. While there is some grossness, as was perhaps expected, the makers are actually quite respectful of the people involved in the Special Olympics.Don't get confused, this is a formula movie, or at least this is what the finished product feels like. The idea of Johnny Knoxville passing as one of the handicapped youths, sounded preposterous. Yet, Mr. Knoxville's performance is one of the reasons for watching it. The great Brian Cox is a hilarious presence as the uncle from hell. Lovely Katherine Heigl adds charm to the proceedings.This is a fun film because it celebrates people that are less fortunate than the rest of us. They are all portrayed in a dignified manner.",7,2,2,29 May 2008
Amélie," Vive Amelie!
","Audrey Tautou has a great screen presence and it's a delight to see her throughout the film, where she's the center of the action. Amelie is just an exception in a world full of self-centered and unhappy people. She's willing to spice those lives she comes in contact with. The jumpy style of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet sets the right tone for this modern day fable set in the Montmartre of today. More than anything, the director has used this beautiful actress in ways that others wouldn't have dared. At times she keeps reminding us of another Audrey, Hepburn, with those expressive eyes of hers. Long live Amelie and Audrey too. Let's hope other directors will use her too and very soon too!",8,3,9,1 December 2001
The Producers," How to succeed in show business without really trying
","Leave it to Leo Bloom to figure out the possibilities in having the worst show on Broadway, and yet, make a bundle by collecting a small fortune from innocent old ladies investing their savings in it. It's no wonder Max Bialystock jumps for joy upon hearing about how to really succeed in show business without really trying!This 1968 version of Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' is a much better film than the recent one unveiled at the end of 2005. We had watched the original movie some time ago and we thought it was quite funny. On second viewing though, some of the fun one had that first time, seems to have disappeared somehow. It seems inconceivable, but this time we found little to laugh about, although this version should have been the definite one because of the presence of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder is far superior than the stars seen on the latest version.Zero Mostel was a colossus in the New York stage. He was a man who could do anything at all and still give an honest performance to everything he did. It was Mr. Mostel's misfortune to have been blacklisted at a time where his career was at an all time high. When film work stopped, Mr. Mostel had the theater to go back. Who knows how far this actor would have gone if he hadn't been a victim of the McCarthym that ruined many lives.Zero Mostel made a creation out of Max Bialystock. This was a man who had seen better days in his producing career days and now finds himself dodging his creditors because he doesn't have the money to pay his debts and has to rely in his stable of old ladies for living. Zero Mostel was the perfect man to play this larger than life character.Gene Wilder, whose second film this is, showed from the beginning to be a genius in the movies. His Leo Bloom was an excellent creation and his chemistry with Zero Mostel seems to be real. The film owes a great deal of its success to Gene Wilder who acts as the straight man.In supporting roles we see Kenneth Mars as the lunatic author of the musical. Christopher Hewett is the gay director who turns the material into a great musical. Lee Meredith makes Ulla fun to watch. Dick Shawn who plays Hitler, makes a good impression. Also some other faces in the cast, Estelle Winwood, Renee Taylor, William Hickey, Frank Campanella, Madelyn Cates, all New York based actors with long experience in the stage and screen.Mel Brooks was going for laughs, and at times, he succeeds brilliantly.",7,13,20,7 February 2006
Shall We Dance," Lost in translation
","One of the worst things anyone can do is to try to tackle something that was made better. Hollywood doesn't seem to learn its lesson at all. In trying to 'Americanize' the great Japanese film of the same name, the film makers had no idea what they were getting into. In fact, the original film, directed with great flair by Masoyuki Suo, loses all its charm with this reincarnation.That said, this edition of 'Shall we Dance' directed by Peter Chelsom, is not a horrible movie, but the freshness and subtleness of its Japanese model was lost in the translation. While the Japanese version was light and captivating, this adaptation is a bit heavy handed. The editing of the film has a lot to do with out enjoyment, and when the dance sequences in the competition are clumsily handled as it's the case here, one wonders what could the creators have been looking at?The idea of seeing Richard Gere as the man who is intrigued by the dancing he sees as he passes the dance academy, is not as credible as one would have expected to be. Mr. Gere is versatile enough as he already showed with his role in 'Chicago'. The idea of his character pulling the wool over his wife Beverly's eyes doesn't come across as too credible. It seems to be a cultural difference that a Japanese wife might be less vocal and accepting a straying husband than in this country by an American wife. That's basically the fatal flaw with the movie, in our humble opinion.Jennifer Lopez comes across better. As Paulina she shows a professional attitude toward her students, but her chemistry with Richard Gere doesn't create any sparks. Susan Sarandon, as Beverly, the wife who suspects her husband's betrayal, underplays her role with better results than some of her late screen appearances. Stanley Tucci's character is irritating, at best and Lisa Ann Walters does what she can with Bobbie.Since you probably have seen this version, take a chance and rent the original Japanese film and compare.",7,20,29,3 January 2006

Adam finds a sympathetic person in the person of Katherine, a therapist working with him in dealing with his cancer. The two form a bond that will sustain him throughout the worst moments he must face.A well meant film directed by Jonathan Levine and written by Will Reiser's whose experience battling the disease is the basis of the fine screenplay he created. The filmmakers did a credible work in presenting a story that feels plausible. They present the story the way Mr. Reiser probably experienced it himself. Being a survivor, his friendship with the actor Seth Rogen plays well in the finished product.No one could have asked for anyone better than Joseph Gordon-Levitt to play Adam. This actor always delivers in whatever vehicle he decides to get involved with. Seth Rogen makes a good Kyle, without going overboard. Anna Kendrick has some fine moments in the film as Katherine, the therapist. Bryce Dallas Howard is seen as Rachael and a fine Anjelica Huston plays Adam's mother.",8,0,0,12 October 2012
Get Him to the Greek," The star handler
","It appears with all the good elements going into 'Get Him to the Greek', it would have been another triumph for the Judd Apatow comedy factory, but something happened on its way to the screen. We are sure all the amazing people that worked on the project had their best intentions for giving the viewer a good time at the movies. The comedy is not exactly inspired and at times it falls flat.The basic excuse for watching the film is to see the amazing Russell Brand as the rock star trying to stay sober and free of drugs. Jonah Hill has done better in other films, especially as Matthew the Waiter, in the much better 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', of which this film is a spin off. Elisabeth Moss as Aaron's girlfriend, give us a break! No one can believe that one. Sean Combs shows up as the obnoxious head of the star's record label.Jason Segel, who co-wrote the score with director Nicholas Stoller should have learned that sequels do not always work, and this film is a proof of it. There are a few things that work and are funny, but for the most part it is a rehash on some other comedies of this genre.",3,3,8,12 August 2011
The Birds," Birds of a feather....
","Bodega Bay is a peaceful community in Northern California. Melanie Daniels has come to this small town trying to outsmart Mitch Brenner, the man who she had met previously at a San Francisco pet shop. Little does Melanie know what she is in for! The first indication everything is not right happens as Melanie, who is returning to the town in a small motor boat, is hit by a flying gull. Mitch, who has followed her, comes to her rescue. Melanie is invited to have dinner that night with Mitch and his family in the house across the bay. Right after dinner, they get a surprise visit through the chimney, when hundreds of birds descend on the Brenner's living room to create panic among them.Melanie, who has met the young teacher, Annie Hayworth, before going to the Brenners, asks her to put her up for the night, since there are no other accommodations in town and she has been invited to attend a party for Cathy, Mitch's young sister. During the celebration, more gulls and even black crows, decide to pay them a visit that upsets the festivity. Right after that, everything turns loose in the small town. The birds are relentless in their attack; it's clear they intend to get their revenge.'The Birds' is one of the scariest films by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. For the time it was filmed, it proved to be a ground breaking movie of this genre. After more than forty years since its release, the film still delivers because Hitchcock knew how to scare his audience even with the innocent gulls and crows that turn into evil creatures bent on destruction of everything in their wake. In a way, it's ironic, as Mrs. Bundy, a woman who knew her birds explains to the people in the local restaurant, only birds of a specie flock together, never mixing with another type. Also, the vengeful birds are seen in contrast with the tamed love birds Melanie has brought, as a present, for Mitch.The film works because of the genius of Hitchcock. Tippi Hedren is a perfect Hitchcock's 'blonde'. Rod Taylor is also effective as Mitch. Jessica Tandy, though, has the best moments to show her range. She goes from the stern Lydia at the beginning to one of an infinite kind when she realizes Melanie loves her son. Suzanne Pleshette is also good as Annie Hayworth. Ethel Griffies makes a wonderful Mrs. Bundy, a no-nonsense woman who can't believe sea gulls could be hurting people, at all.'The Birds' is an entertaining film that will be cherished by many Hitchcock's fans because of all the elements that went into it.",10,10,20,25 March 2006
Cinderella Man," The Braddock family in the Great Depresion
","Ron Howard's latest film 'Cinderella Man' probably miscalculated its release date. Being a serious film about a real incident in a not too glamorous era, the movie arrives in the middle of the summer releases that seem to be made for action packed adventures or thrillers that don't require much of the viewer. That said, 'Cinderella Man' presents a vivid portrait of one of the worst times in American history: The Great Depression.At the center of the story is James Bradock, a fighter that is seen at the beginning of the film with what appears an assured future. Then, the bad times that affected the country have a profound effect in the Braddock family. From living with a certain degree of comfort, they are relegated to eke out a living in order to survive.James Braddock's work in the New Jersey's piers becomes scarce, as only a few men are employed at a time. Early on, in a fight, Jimmy breaks a hand that puts him to a disadvantage among the men working at hauling cargo in and out of ships. Fortunately, Mike Wilson, a decent man, also impoverished by the situation, gives him a hand whenever they are teamed together. This will be a friendship that will last forever.At home, things go from bad to worse. Mae Braddock, the wife and mother of three children, tries to make do with whatever little she can lay her hands in. It's heart wrenching to watch her try to put food on the table, let alone something that might have any nourishment. Jimmy Braddock has to resort to get public assistance and even to beg from the people that congregate at a Madison Square Garden club.James Braddock's true friend turns out to be Joe Gould, who would guide him back to a phenomenal comeback that establishes him as one of the great fighters of the times. Jim Braddock goes to fight the powerful Max Baer, a man that has been notorious for killing a couple of opponents in the ring.The film is satisfying in spite of all the desolation and poverty one sees. Of course, it's evident we either never went through those bad times of the 30s, or have never been in Mr. Braddock's family position. In spite of all that is against them, the family made out well and even went to prosper, which says a lot for them. Above all, Mr. Braddock teaches us a lesson in how to keep his family united in spite of the rough times they were facing.As James Braddock, Russell Crowe makes a fabulous contribution. He transforms himself into the fighter that has to face poverty in order to appreciate what came afterward as a reward. Renee Zellwegger is fine as the suffering Mae. Paul Giamatti makes a tremendous appearance as Joe Gould. Paddy Considine plays Mike Wilson, the man who helped Braddock resume his work in the docks by carrying an extra weight when his friend was obviously in pain.The screen play by Cliff Hollinger and Akiva Goldsman takes an intelligent account of the era. Finally, Ron Howard scores a real winner with this film, that should be seen by more people because it presents a real portrait of a man that was genuine and loved his family.",8,5,9,15 June 2005
The Soloist," The cellist
","A Los Angeles newspaper columnist, Steve Lopez, hears a homeless man play a violin that only has two strings. Mr. Lopez is intrigued by the man that is attempting to play with such an instrument. The street person is asked about some names painted on a tree, the reporter is impressed to learn those were Julliard fellow students. If Steve is correct, this man, Nathaniel Ayers, has been formally trained in the New York's most prestigious music school. His curiosity makes him check out to see if there is any truth in what Ayers had told him. To his amazement, he learns that yes, Mr. Ayers had gone to Julliard, but didn't graduate as a cellist, not as a violinist.The lives of these two men become intertwined in ways neither one expected. Steve Lopez decided to help get Ayers on his feet again, something the homeless man didn't know how to deal with because his mental condition. However much Steve Lopez tried to aid Ayers, he always got a negative reaction from this man whose evident schizophrenia doesn't let them deal with reality.In flashbacks we get to know the progression of Nathaniel Ayers' mental disorder as he goes from a talented young cello player, to being granted admission in Julliard. From a somewhat poor environment, Mr. Ayers arrives in New York, a big and cold place, to make a life for himself while receiving a musical education. Something in his mind didn't quite respond to the emotions he was feeling. The result was a total breakdown for Nathaniel, who resorted to a life on the streets. It is not made clear how did he end up in Los Angeles, a cruel place where some 90,000 homeless men and women live in squalor.This was a film with impressive credentials. Joe Wright directed 'Atonement' and 'Pride and Prejudice', so we were looking forward to his new work. The film was co-written by Steve Lopez and Susannah Grant, of 'In Her Shoes', and 'Erin Brokovich' fame. Naturally, our high hopes didn't quite pay off because the tragic figure of Nathaniel Ayers plight doesn't involve us the way he should.Basically, and this is something we noticed when we saw the trailers, Jamie Foxx's characterization of the mentally disturbed Nathaniel Ayers leaves us cold. Granted, the actor has to receive direction in order to bring out his character, but one never feels Mr. Foxx is that man, but an actor impersonating that tragic disoriented individual. On the other hand, the main reason for watching the film is Robert Downey Jr., one of our best actors working in movies these days. Mr. Downey Jr. captures the essence of Steve Lopez convincingly. There was no chemistry between the actors.The excellent Catherine Keener, always a welcome presence in any movie, shows up as a Los Angeles Times editor, Mary Weston, who was Steve's former wife. Tom Hollander is also seen as a musical instructor trying to help Nathaniel. Lisa Gay Hamilton also has a small part.",7,2,4,27 December 2009

Frankly, not even knowing what to expect, we had hesitated about seeing it, but what a pleasant surprise this movie turned out to be! If one goes with an open mind, it will entertain anyone in any age group.The film is insane. Ben Stiller does probably his best work in a while. He's been in lots of films lately that don't do anything for him, let alone show him at his goofiest self. Mr. Thurber must have seen a possibility casting him, and it paid handsomely. Vince Vaughn, plays with a straight face, but he is quite good and holds his own playing opposite to Mr. Stiller.The scenes in Las Vegas, during the finals of the Dodgeball tournament are absolutely insane. The game is a lot of fun to watch and will turn any viewer into a fan. Be prepared to laugh a lot! Light fare like this is always welcome and Rawson Marshall Turner knows how to keep us happy.",7,1,2,25 July 2004
The Fighter," Knocked out
","Not having read anything about the film, but attracted by the fact that it was a David O. Russell's movie, based loosely on a real life story involving two half-brothers that have spent time in the boxing ring, we decided we had to see it. Having enjoyed the director's wonderful 'Three Kings', 'Flirting With Disaster', and 'Spanking the Monkey', was enough to sell us into going. We were pleasantly surprised by what it turned out to be one of the best films of the year.The brothers from depressed Lowell, Massachussets, are at the center of the story. Dicky Eklund is the older brother, and Mickey Ward the youngest. Dicky boxing career took a turn for the worst when he fell prey to drugs that almost ruined his life. Mickey Ward wanted to follow his brothers into the ring, but he was considered not to have what it took in order to make it into the big fights.The brothers have a powerful mother in Alice, who, in addition, has raised seven other girls that are part of the dysfunctional family. Dicky's addiction takes a heavy toll on him; not only is he a loser, he is a mess. Mickey, on the other hand, realizes his brother was a great fighter who was able to win over Sugar Ray Leonard, but crack smoking got in his way. Mickey worshiped his brother and knew he needed him on his side if he wanted to make a name for himself.Mickey sets his eye in putting Dicky's excellent style to use, if he wants to make it all the way to the top. Having fallen for Charlene, the tough bartender at the bar he frequents, he angers Alice, who cannot take the young woman with a mind of her own. Charlene has been around the neighborhood to know the family secrets. Mickey decides to accept the offer to train in Las Vegas, backed by a professional team, but in doing so, he realizes he needs Dicky more than he thought.The best thing in the film is the way Mr. Russell got the stellar performances out of his strong cast. Christian Bale is a chameleon; he gets into Dicky Eklund with relish in one of his best appearances in film. The wonderful Mellissa Leo makes Alice come to life in all her glory. We have known women like her; she makes us believe she is none other than the mother who is champion for the sport of boxing, as well as a supporter for her children. The real surprise in the picture is Amy Adams, who up to now has played naive and uncomplicated characters in her movie career. As Charlene, she shows a remarkable strength going out of type to give one of her best displays as an actress in any of her films. Mark Wahlberg, unfortunately plays the weakest role and he is outdone by his cast members.The production was vividly photographed by Hoyte Van Hoytema who captures the excitement of the bouts as well as the poverty of Lowell. Mark Wahlberg ought to be congratulated in the way he has backed several worthwhile projects, as well as being one of the producers of this amazing film. David O. Russell keeps surprising with each new effort.",9,2,4,31 January 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," An justice for all
","Certain films defy logic, something that in many instances, the viewer does not mind, as long as the story makes some sense. 'Law Abiding Citizen' was clearly a vehicle for Gerald Butler, who is credited as one of the producers. F. Gary Gray, and the writer, Kurt Wimmer, have combined forces to give us this drama in which a man, the victim of a horrendous crime that resulted in the death of his wife, and daughter, decides to take justice in his own hands to teach a lesson to the the system that did not serve him well.The confrontation with Nick Rice, a Philadelphia D.A. and Clyde Shelton is something that films of this genre emphasizes by way of having Clyde one step ahead of Nick in whatever revenge he is trying to extract from the man he perceived made a pact with one of the criminals that killed his two loved ones. The hatred is such that it will consume almost one hour and fifty minutes of screen time where all kinds of nasty things will happen.Unfortunately, even fans of this type of film, will see the impossibility of Clyde getting away with most of the things he does in pursuit of justice. Gerard Butler has the best part in the film. Villains almost always offer the opportunity to make an impact on the audience, as Mr. Butler does with his sly ways. Jamie Foxx, on the other hand, is not as effective as Nick Rice as one expected. Some of the supporting players, notably Colm Meaney, a good actor, Bruce McGill, Michael Irby and Leslie Bibb do not have much to do in the film.",6,1,2,27 January 2011
From Here to Eternity," The Bugle of Schofield Barracks
","James Jones' epic novel was bought for the movies for a mere $82,000, which is nothing, even for those years. This lengthy novel, of almost 900 pages presented a problem for Columbia Pictures because how could a book this size be condensed into a two hour movie? The task of the adaptation fell into Daniel Taradash, an excellent screen writer with a good track record.The end result, as seen through Fred Zinnemann's brilliant direction, showed aspects of the book, but because of the censorship reigning in Hollywood in those years, could have never been shown to the vast audience this film attracted. One of the novel aspects deals with the homosexuality in the Honolulu of the times. It's clear that some of the enlisted men had liaisons with the gay men that treated them to things their meager income didn't allowed them to have. Maggio, is one of the ones instrumental for involving Prewitt into visiting his closeted friends.The film deals with two other thorny aspects: adultery and prostitution. Milt Warden, the right hand man of Capt. Holmes, has an eye for his wife Karen, who rumor had it, loved to played around, just as her husband does during his 'business in town'. In the novel, Karen has an eight year child, who is conveniently disposed of. Their love affair consumed both Milt and Karen. At the same time, a manly Milt, is seen in an intimate moment when he is trying to console Prewitt, who has been ostracized by his refusal to become one of the boxers in the base. Milt caresses Prewitt's hair in what might have been an overture to have something more than a friendship with the gay Prewitt.The prostitution issue comes when Maggio takes Prewitt drinking and introduces him to the Congress Club, a brothel. Prewitt's relationship with Alma, the girl from Oregon, is toned down because of the fear of trouble with the Hays Code people. It was a hypocritical way to do things, but who knows what would have come out had the film been done today.'From Here to Eternity' still keeps its crisp black and white cinematography that Burnett Guffey gave the film. It's inconceivable to think of it in Technicolor! The score by George Duning serves the action well with its haunting melody. Fred Zinnemann vision paid big time because his vision for the project had the right approach even when it masks the original text.Montgomery Clift, one of the most handsome actors working in films at the time, is about the best thing in the film. It appears Mr. Clift was a catalyst for the film, in that he made everyone else excel in the performances they gave. As Robert E. Lee Prewitt, this actor is a pure joy to watch because his transformation into the character. Frank Sinatra has been celebrated for his role as Maggio, yet, he only has a couple of scenes where he shows an intensity and a range he hadn't projected before.Burt Lancaster as the all American, and supposedly macho Sgt. Warden, does a fine job. Deborah Kerr work as Karen Holmes showed an actress who understood what made her character tick. It's hard to imagine that Joan Crawford was supposed to have played her and she would have thrown the film out of balance. Donna Reed, as the kind Alma, gave a fine performance. Philip Ober, Mickey Shaugnessy, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Warden, Tim Ryan, and an uncredited George Reeves are seen among the supporting players.'From Here to Eternity' is a must see film for all serious fans.",8,30,42,28 May 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Odyssey according to the Coen brothers
","The Coen brothers are probably America's most creative minds in recent years as shown by the many projects they have brought for our benefit in order to entertain us. As with all creative persons, some films are extraordinary, some are excellent, and a few miss the mark. Having seen the film in its original release, we were fortunate to see again in DVD format recently. With 'O Brother, Where Art Thou', the Coens are at their best. Joel and Ethan Coen gathered one of the best group of performers to be in the film. George Clooney is seen as Ulysses, or Odysseus in the Greek epic, the man at the center of the action. Never has this actor been given this great opportunity and he has responded in ways that bowled us in watching him portray his character on the screen. To say this is his best work in the movies, is perhaps not saying anything at all! Mr. Clooney can thank the Coens for trusting in him and giving him the role of his career.The rest of the cast is perfection. Most of the players are part of the Coen's troupe of talented players at their disposal to give life to their characters in film. John Turturro, John Goodman and Holly Hunter have been in other films by the brothers and shine in this movie. Tim Blake Nelson, Charles Durning, Del Pentecost, and Daniel Von Bargen, among others do extraordinary work for the Coen team.The musical score by T Bone Burnett is what makes this movie unique. The use of the music works so well with the film as does Mr. Clooney's singing. Roger Deakins' cinematography also adds a rich texture to the story. A must see for all Coen brothers fans!",8,4,6,1 September 2005
