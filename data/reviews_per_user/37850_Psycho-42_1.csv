Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Finally I saw it myself, and I just love it!
","At last the movie arrived Germany! I was so curious about this movie, because i heard so many bad critics and i just couldn't believe them. Now, finally, I had the chance of figure it out for myself, and.... I don't know what's wrong with all the people! I was lucky to see the midnight-premier of 'The phantom menace' and I loved it from the beginning. I mean, hey: IT IS STAR WARS! And in my opinion, this movie has the same magic as its prequels ( or sequels). The lightsaber duels are unbelievable fast and very good choreographed, the pod-race was simply stunning as all the other special effects. Alright, but I have to admit, that the movie had some weak points which the first three movies didn't have. But they're no serious weaknesses. I mean, all the fuzz about Jar Jar Binks... He's not that bad, actually, I kinda liked him. Funny guy.What I am trying to say: Forget all the critics or what other people tell you. Even if you like Star Wars just a little, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. Well, I have and I'm gonna see it for at least three more times.",10,0,0,20 August 1999
