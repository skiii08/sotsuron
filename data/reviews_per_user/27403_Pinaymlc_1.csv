Despicable Me 2," I don't get the hype..
","Literally the only thing my whole group of friends could do after the movie was stare at each other and wonder what we just saw. It was funny at times, yes. But the plot was lacking in originality. Most of the supposedly funny parts were more like annoying attempts to being funny, but not really succeeding. The new woman character was nowhere near appealing and flat out unlikable. Pretty disappointing. I have no idea how this gets anywhere above a 6. I usually don't rate movies, but I really felt like I wasted my money on this one. A lot of minion action but I feel like it might have been too much. The ending was just disappointing... I feel like they could have made it a lot more thrilling but it was way too predictable. There wasn't much of a buildup of a plot, and the way they solved the problem was just too easy. There was inconsistency and some more inappropriate scenes that would require some explanation for kids.. I don't know. This movie was definitely one I wouldn't waste my time and money on. Much rather just watch the first one again.",5,5,10,17 July 2013
