The Blair Witch Project," One of the Great Horror Films, but Careful Where you See It
","This is truly one of the great horror films, not just because it's scary but because of the way the film comments on what makes its characters open to fear and destruction.  It's one of the most cogent comments on its generation that I've ever seen, and the greatest compliment I can pay the film makers is that after getting us to laugh at the characters, particularly their self-absorption and lack of grounding in the real world, it still made me feel sorry for them. But be warned:  now that the film has gone wide, I'd recommend not going to your typical mall theatre.  The screening I attended was filled with people who had no idea what to expect. Aside from the usual annoyances-late arrivals, cell phones and almost constant talking-the audience was audibly antagonistic to the film.  I think they wanted severed heads and loving closeups of mutilated bodies, which is definitely not what this movie is about.  In a way, the audience at that screening WAS the characters on screen, even if they were incapable",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
U-571," Less Than Meets the Eye
","U-571 is the kind of film that seems original to people who've never seen a submarine movie before.  The picture has cliches that were hairy during World War II, an over-active camera that gets in the way of the few good performances and makes some scenes almost totally incoherent and a script so leaden they could have put it in the ballast tanks to make the sub sink.Worst things about the picture:  1) the script giving the U.S. credit for cracking the Enigma Code when it was principally a British endeavor, particularly the decoding, but then, they don't make summer action flicks about gay British mathematicians; 2) the attack on the U.S. sub, so poorly shot and edited it's hard to tell who's killed and who survived (not helped by a cast of young actors who all look alike in their World War II haircuts).Best things about the picture:  1) Harvey Keitel, an acting god given the kind of dialogue Hollywood used to stick William Bendix with and, like the much underrated Bendix, he still makes it work (let's just hope nobody decides to star him in a big-screen version of 'The Life of Riley'; 2) Jack Noseworthy, who's developing the kind of eyes and cheekbones that stars are made of.  Noseworthy is dead-on in every scene as the German-American farm boy who's ashamed of his heritage.  Unfortunately, most fans are mistaking him for Jon Bon Jovi (who has a few scenes as an officer then vanishes without a trace during the big sub attack).  Hopefully Hollywood's casting directors won't make the same mistake.",2,0,1,14 May 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Dumbed Down But Still Fun
","Sure, this sequel was dumbed down from the not-so-smartoriginal, but it's still a lot of fun.  For once, the stuff Ihate in Woo's films (starting with those damned pigeons) waskept to a minimum, while what he does best (action) was at theforefront.  He even showed some development in the area of humanpsychology.  Be warned, there are some big lifts from Hitchcock('Notorious' and a second villain right out of 'North byNorthwest'), but the thing moves so fast you won't have time toresent it.Best things in the film besides the action:  Cruise's smile--inthis film his character is very much a danger junkie; his scenewith Anthony Hopkins early on setting up the plot; Ving Rhames'return; and, best of the best, Thandie Newton.  Not only is shebeautiful, but she has a wonderfully expressive body and facewith the biggest eyes since Bambi.  She manages to give the filmsome depth without slowing anything down.  I hope this picturemakes her a",8,1,1,28 May 2000
