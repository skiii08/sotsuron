Walk the Line," Best Film Ever
","I found the performances riveting and haunting. The characterization of Johnny and June are good enough, but even without them, this film would have been terrific. Joachin and Reese made this film what it is now and will be in the future. The original music of Johnny and June was good, but Joachin and Reese surpassed their singing in all aspects. I cannot get enough of the movie soundtrack (which I purchased immediately after I saw the film). I cannot wait to buy the DVD so I can watch Walk The Line over and over. I will now be a truly loyal fan of both of these terrific actors. What a wonderful idea it would be to have these two perform at the Oscars. They certainly should win and if they don't, I will be tremendously sad. This kind of talent is very rare.",10,0,1,24 December 2005
