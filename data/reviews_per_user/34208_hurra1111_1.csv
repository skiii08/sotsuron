First Man," Sensitive Movie
","The atmosphere and emotions are very well transported. It's more about the people and less about the achivement landing on the moon. So I would highly recommend this film.
The only thing which should be mentioned too, in my humble oppinion the handheld camera style was partly too wild if you watch it from the front rows in the movie theatre.",9,1,3,11 November 2018
