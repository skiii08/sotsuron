Angels & Demons," A glimpse into the inner workings of the Vatican's Curia
","Not a fan of the Da Vinci series this one is the rare exception. Tom Hanks returns as the Symbolist Robert Langdon to investigate a murder mystery kept secret by the Vatican. This movie delves into the history of Reformation era Europe. The film is a political critic so to speak of Vatican responses or rather reactions to reform and secularism over the centuries. We get to see Langdon working with Dr Victoria Vetra, a CERN scientist traversing the beautiful city ruins of Rome figuring out yet another disturbing mystery that jeopardizes all of Christianity. We learn of a secret conspiracy in the high echelons of the Catholic Church. The Anti-Christ Papacy is before us and Langdon and Vetra must learn from the texts how to interpret what is playing out in front of them. Great scenery and it was brilliant to have access to Vatican archives and seeing what the Vatican looks like from all angles. Langdon goes through a Damascene conversion of sorts as he too is no fool to political intriguing that is going on within the Catholic Church and the need for guidance. Guidance offered by Ewan McGregor's role in the film as the caretaker Pope during a period of unease within the Vatican.",8,0,0,2 May 2017
Scarface," Crime Biopic
",The biography of a ruthless Cuban American who emigrates to America and starting at the bottom rises up to become the Kingpin of Florida and the South West Coast. This film is the American dream the brave and bold turned upside down and inside out. Al Pacino is great in this film as Toni. Depending on how you at this character and his achievements he is either a great man who worked hard to become the Kingpin of crime or an unfortunate cook who has a lot of reasons to hate Castro. What is indisputable though is that the viewer finds themselves caught up in his world and rooting for him against the obviously more deranged Cartels who are even worse than him. Worth watching this film just to see the glories final and the soundtrack is perhaps the best in all the mob movies presently out there.,9,0,1,26 April 2017
Chinatown," A Complicated and Intrigueing Detectives Movie
","This detective's movie is an engaging watch. Jack Nicolson's performance was superb and his commanding presence on screen is a testament to such a fine actor. The costume designer must also get a mention. That jacket was swanky. As for the film it was such a grim, fascinating and intricate story. Who to trust? The more important question was who would stand in the way of finding out the truth? The answer to that would prove to be the cop leading the investigation and the one who would keep it that way.For such an interesting and disturbing film it is therefore disappointing that it ends so unfished. It would seem that the director or writer discarded his work as it was climaxing. With the secret exposed the story just petered out. It ends in Chinatown with a thoroughly dissatisfying closing. Although it does give food to though that the movie is more horror than detective. The conclusion of this film is that detectives only find out murderers and criminals and they do not catch them bring about a remedy. The major character did not cover himself in glory as he himself had taken part in a catalogue of felonies. His actions would prove to be detrimental to the person he was trying to help.",8,0,1,11 September 2014
Se7en," Good movie
","Seven is an extremely good crime thriller. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are really good in this movie. The movie is really dark with many effective scenes in the movie. It is like the director is going out of his way to make the viewer queasy. All in all it is a good movie if a bit dark for my liking but the characters are good and the narrative is also worthy of respect. It is a blend of crime, horror and Thriller movies and shows and in some respects it is a foreshadow to the CSI series that now are all over TV.Great performance from Brad Pitt in this movie. The gritty feel of the movie is also very realistic.",7,2,3,9 March 2014
The Big Lebowski," Great and Worth Watching Satire
","Never heard of this movie before this year and I was hesitant about even watching it at all. Some farcical obscure title with some people apparently calling it a cult classic. Was I wrong! This movie was funny as hell and the lead character The 'Dude' played by Jeff bridges is a rally likable person. You want him to succeed in getting restitution for his soiled carpet. Even his crew Walter Sobchak the unstable veteran and Donny his other Bowling buddy are straight forward rad characters. Their escapades in the movie are hilarious.We see nihilist thugs, loan sharks and a con artist billionaire Lebowski with his name confused with that of the Dudes. This movie is well worth the watch. Goodman drove the movie and probably played one of his best roles.",8,0,2,19 April 2014
Fight Club," Respectably Bizarre.
","This movie is a fairly decent movie if a bit excessively violent. The concept of Fight Clubs being set up across the United States is really cool although the first half an hour of the movie is dull and bizarre.When Bradd Pitt showed up the movie took off and became very interesting and attractive to watch. I was eager to see more. Having said that the movie was overloaded with intense scenes of what I would consider unnecessary violence and vulgar emotions.The twist at the end was unexpected and a masterpiece of film history, something that this movie should be credited with. Still this movie is a mix of bravado and chauvinism and that is not what I subscribe to in personal favourites.If you like people fighting and being against the establishment than this is your movie. Enjoy!",6,0,2,2 May 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Star Wars space war Movie
","A worthy successor to the Star Wars Franchise has arrived. Gritty & realistic War movie that takes place in the fictional Star Wars universe, you don't have to be a fan of Star Wars to like this movie. Action packed yet full of clever Star Wars references this movie digs deep into the Star Wars mythos to bring us an exciting Space Epic. Dark forces rule the Galaxy and with the absence of the Jedi Order it is up to a band of discontents led by a reluctant heroine to save the Galaxy from the newly built Death Star. The characters are all shadier than their counterparts in the Original Trilogy. In this era they are all like Han Solo. The visuals are what you would expect from a major blockbuster and once again ILM studios bring back the inventive new creatures that made the 80's installments so great. By having so much of the film set in or around a city it really brings out a war atmosphere that we see so little of in the Originals. This is a real war between two sides that really hate each other. A fact that is underscored by having figures such as Director Krennic, King Organa, Supreme commander Mon Mothma all set the scene and given greater attention than lightsaber battles.",10,5,10,26 April 2017
X-Men," Missable and lacking Merit
","X- Men This movie should be called Hugh Jackman the movie as he dominates the film. People idolise Wolverine at the expense of others. Basically the film is the live action version of the comic books featuring mutants with superhuman powers. One group led by Charles Xavier starring Patrick Stewart and the other group by Magneto starring Ian Mckellen. The potential was there to have more mutants, better character development and a stronger plot. Alas they went with a conventional story about Logan an angry person looking to know who he is. My favourite X- Men was in fact a women Storm played by Halle Berry. Her character was well acted and interesting and the nightmare that was Catwomen had not yet been made. Poor choice in having so few characters and focusing on Wolverine. On the plus side more X-Men give us the chance of having more characters introduced and having better plots. So let us hope new the films are a lot better.",7,0,2,17 December 2014
Rocky II," A Masterclass Movie
","Following on from the success of the first film in the series Rocky 2 continues the story and focuses on the theme of handling life after greatness. As Apollo's ego gets the best of him and forces him to pursue Rocky outside the ring to get him back into the ring we see an aimless Rocky looking for work and dealing with the fallout of being a celebrity. This movie improves upon the first with Rocky's trainer Mickey given a greater role in preparing Rocky for the ultimate rematch awaiting. Once again the soundtrack, the emotion and the fight this time bigger and more dangerous combines to create a master class film.",10,2,2,26 April 2017
Predator," The Ultimate Jungle movie
","Epic movie. Six American commandos led by Dutch aka Arnold Schwarzenegger are sent on a mission into the JUNGLES OF CENTRAL America accompanied by a CIA agent to rescue the crew of a downed Ministerial aircraft believed to have been kidnapped by guerrillas. What they end up coming across is a terrifying fight for survival and whole lot of pain.This movie made in 1987 is classic cinematic gold. Very little talk but this is made up for by excellent fight scenes and the graphic nature of machine gunfire against a Predator capable of cloaking himself. One by one the Commandoes lose their abilities to resist the creature hunting them until the leader and protagonist must finally take him on alone.The Predator and Commandoes are perfect rivals. They cancel out each others skills. All of the team lack the weapons, armour and physical strength possessed by the Predator yet at the end we see expert knowledge and the determination shown by our protagonist is strong enough to slay the over confident creature.",10,1,2,18 May 2014
Spider-Man," Spider-Man Best Ever
","Marvel's greatest superhero is given a great film that compliments the talent of Stan Lee. The casting of Tobey Maguire, Williem Dafoe & Kirsten Dunst her best work is a perfect example of Directors picking good celebrities to fill great roles. They all put in memorable performances in this Romance story which was a big part. Peter and Mary Jane was a perfect match together as portrayed, now the material they had to work with the great Spiderman comics helped in creating those characters. Not so the Green Goblin. Dafoe made that character just like Nicolson made the Joker in Tim' Burton's Batman. Instead of a generic bad guy we got a likable schizophrenic who was screwed by the people around in. The film is a comic classic.",9,0,1,26 April 2017
The Dirty Dozen," Brilliant American War Movie
","This movie was made twenty years before I was born an even though I had heard of this title I never saw the film, not even in passing. I thought I must have seen it on TV sometime but no I was wrong. Having just seen it recently I can honestly say it is brilliant. Turning a group of convicts into a trained militia, sending them off to do battle with the Nazis in advance of the D-Day landings depicts the cruelty of war & the chance to start a new life post war. It is fascinating to see Americans in this period. Not knowing much about American colloquialism this gives a new more down to earth feel of what it was like back then. Gone are the days of the Cowboys and now even the criminals are being called up for duty. The interactions between Major Reisman the protagonist who is ordered to train this rabble are very amusing. One example of this which sums up the situation the convicts find themselves is this dialogueWladislaw (Reading the paper) He was going over the hill. My outfit was pinned down by the worst crossfire you ever saw. Half of them bleeding to death. And this lover took off like a rabbit. . .. . .with the medical supplies on his back. The only way to stop him was to shoot him. Anyhow, he had it coming.Major Reisman: Yeah. But you only made one mistake,Wladislaw: huh?Major Reisman: (Leaving the room) Guard.Major Reisman: You let somebody see you do it. Just like Wladislaw the Polish American officer the other criminals are also bitter against the military authority. Victor Franco the Chicago petty mobster, Posey the Apache, Jimenez the Mexican, Robert Jefferson an African American who believes the white court deliberating convicted him. Not forgetting the actual mad man 'Maggot'. The other cast of lesser criminals that form this motley crew must work and fight as a team. Major Resiman is accompanied by Sgt Bowren in this task The most likable character is Vernon Pickely a weak minded crowd pleaser with his service being required to impersonate a general on the orders of Major Reisman which is a court martial offense of itself. The one sleazy moment in the film is when the men must meet the women. This film shows how the criminals have the determination to win by breaking the rules while the Colonels and Captains are restricted by arrogance.",10,0,3,4 May 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A Deserving Successor to Jurrassic Park
",The Jurassic Park Trilogy is one example of a franchise that works. The Lost World is a worthy sequel to the original. Unlike with the Star Wars Prequel series Jurassic Park is a movie that can produce good TV. A combination of good acting and the realism of the Dinosaurs make it a good watch.The movie is not without faults. The scene when the T-Rex arrives in San Diego is an error in editing as is the villain of the story who is lame and non sensible in his behaviours. Going into the cargo hold to see the baby T-Rex was bad story writing. The other issues concern the lack of fleshing out the tertiary characters and not showing how the T-Rex was taken down which is what I would have liked to see.Omitting those faults the story is still great. An adventure on an Island full of terrifying Lizards. Hunters coming to snatch a T-Rex and bring it back to San Diego for amusement. The references to Cadillac & Dinosaurs is really neat. Also the story touches on the themes of Jules Verne's The Mysterious Island. Obviously the idea of a Dinosaur running around San Diego was original.All in all a good prequel to the original.,8,0,1,31 May 2014
JFK," The ultimate Conspiracy Theory
","Director Oliver Stone does it again with another brilliant movie this time the conspiracy of who shot President JFK. The subject matter is already intense and fascinating, so many documentaries about the assassination. What you get with this movie is a mystery. So many people wanted JFK dead and this film brings it all to the fore. The political undertones to this film does have the effect of discouraging the non political to disengage. For those people this movie is boring. For those who appreciate a good mystery like myself the value of describing the participants in the cover up and the shoddy police work that occurred does a great service in showing us a real clear picture of 60's Texas. The drawback which is a feature of Stone's work is the preaching of the protagonist. Aside from that small aspect the film stands on its own as a great thriller. People are free to make up their mind as to whether or not JFK was indeed killed by an inside agent or a mercenary hired Oswald to take the hit. As an intellectual movie that serves to inform the public of the misdeeds of public officials i would say Oliver Stone has provided a valuable contribution to American democracy.",7,2,4,26 April 2017
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Awesome, Cool and Bodacious film
","A surprisingly good movie. Ben Stiller is a wonderful actor and this is a demonstration of his ability of pulling off movies that are not all comedic. I had no idea what would happen when each scene appeared. The concept of having him go to Greenland and getting caught up in a Volcano Eruption was amazing. The scene when he was sitting in a pub and the singer in the back wanted him to sing I thought that moments later he would be drunk and singing along with him but no the film went in an entirely different direction.The skateboarding scene was cool, Sean Penn was pretty slick in the film and it felt like the whole movie was an advertisement for visiting Mountains which is kind of bizarre in good way. The film had a moral to the story which was essentially don't treat employees like trash but all in all a very fun and entertaining escape from most other comedies and films that are very bland.",7,1,1,28 July 2014
Ghostbusters," Great 80's movie
","Director Ivan Reitman brings us classic movie magic, Ghostbusters. Major stars, Bill Murray, Dan Akyroyd, Signourey Weaver & Harold Ramis also starring Rick Moranis and Ernie Hudson. It tells the story of three Ghost hunters that discover New York is a hive of supernatural activity. In this hilarious movie the three decide to set up a business that catches ghosts and spirits, they recruit a fourth member and they wind up uncovering an ancient prophesy foretelling the rise of a Sumerian Goddess.A tribute to the great city of New York, Bill Murray is exceptional as the cynical Ghostbuster. The soundtrack that accompanies this movie is epic. From Slimer to the Marshmallow Man and the Vicious Dog the special effects for the time were quite good. A real sense of fun permeates the film. Good natured and suitable for all age groups. 80's film like this has become a cinematic classic.",10,3,4,16 December 2014
Patton," Wonderful war movie
","Patton is a great biographical account of one of WW2's most enigmatic Generals. Confirming the view that 60's and 70's war movies are better than modern incarnations. They were able to capture the atmosphere of war better back then..This movie is free of the propaganda that is in many war movies that depict the Nazis as barbarians and the allies as liberators. Patton is correctly depicted as a man of the military. He even admits it during the movie unlike Montgomery,Bradley or Eisenhower who have different attitudes.Patton is seen more like an officer of the Afrika Korp than an Allied General. This movie does a great job in being true to form in portraying him and showing the viewer the mind set of the General who is clearly not a fan of ceremonial military forces but a force that can repel attack and launch daring Napoleonic warfare against enemy forces.This movie is well worth seeing.",8,4,5,25 June 2014
Groundhog Day," From the People who gave us Ghostbusters bring us Groundhogs Day
","A weatherman must repeat the same day over and over again until he changes his ways for the best and break the spell. The best Romantic Comedy out there. Bill Murray stars as Phil the unhappy, unpleasant weather forecaster sent to the annual Groundhog festival hoping to get this small town hill billy event over with. As it turns out he is trapped in a time loop and is desperate to escape. During the course of the movie he starts to mend his ways and becomes an honest caring person deeply in love with his co – worker. The spell ends and Phil decides to live in the town with his true love.Enjoyable and funny a great 90's hit.",9,1,2,17 December 2014
Total Recall," Wonderful Action Movie
","Classic Action Adventure Old school movie with doses of disgust throw in to make it realistic. Arnold plays one of his greatest parts in this movie. The attention to detail in showing Mars and Earth of the future is imaginative, quirky and impressive. Ignoring all the science which by all intense and purposes is fantasy this movie is plain and simply a fight against evil doers. Secret agent type death squad walking the streets of Earth hunting down an enemy of the Earth. Even Marc Alaimo made a cameo and he became the Tyrant Gul Dukat in Star Trek Deep Space Nine years later. Yes this is a world eerily similar to the Robocop world with the same Ronny Cox as the Dastardly Ruler.Many other films do what this movie does which is have a bunch of Rebels fight against the state and then have an action man come to the rescue but what makes this movie works is a combination great scenes, both exotic and mundane mixed together with futuristic concepts like going to Mars,cosmopolitan atmosphere and Arnold beating up really nasty folks.In some ways the scenes on Mars are crude depictions of warzones in places like Syria today. It is very hard to portray this movie as Science Fiction as it would be stretching science a good bit. It is a typical Action movie of its age.",8,0,1,19 April 2014
Rocky," A Powerful Story
","This is Sylvester Stallone's greatest work of art. 70's period piece set in Philadelphia about the strugglers of a down on his luck amateur boxer. One day the Champion of the World Apollo Creed enters his world and gives him an opportunity of his life. Rocky must rise to the occasion, overcome life obstacles fight in the biggest contest in the world against the greatest Boxer of them all. The drab setting of Rocky is somewhat hard to get into at first but as the movie progresses you come to admire Rocky more and more until finally you see him as a cut above the rest with his love Adrian and determination to prove he is a champion. Never quit, never lay down and always aim for the stars is the Rocky story. The fact that it so happens to be a boxing movie and the violent nature of the sport just goes to show how good drama is that people who would normally dislike such a sport can get invested in it.",9,1,1,26 April 2017
Mystic River," Interesting Watch
","A haunting movie with two of Hollywood's A star actors Sean Penn & Kevin Bacon. The movie tells the tale of vigilante justice in a tough neighbourhood. Personally I found the movie slow and the narrative hard to get into but the scenes with the Investigators are the best part of the film.Movies like this tend to expose the mob element of the major characters. As such your attention is distracted by the behaviours of these characters and not on any central plot which was missing in this movie. This movie tries to replicate a book and for me it was not an enjoyable movie. It was however expertly acted.As always when focusing on the mature themes of the movie you have to be very delicate in handling this subject matter. The movie continues like so many other mob shows like the Godfather, Sopranos & The Goodfellas in glamorising the Mafia.Despite my dislike of this aspect of the story I am glad that I watched the film.",6,1,1,19 April 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Entertaining and Funny
","Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell and Fred Willard at their finest. They have all been in funny shows in the past like Married with Children or The Office but this movie is one of the greatest collaborative comedy movies of the decade. Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn make great contributions to this comedy also.A really enjoyable watch. Plenty of humour, characters are well developed and the spoof of the 1970's is really informative for someone who was not born in that era. I pretty much envisage the 70's as being like how the movie portrays it. Sexist, Crazy and oddly rhythmic.I would say the movie does a much better job in portraying the 70's than Austin Powers does in portraying the 60's. While Austin is slapstick funny Anchorman is straightforward funny. It adds to the appeal of this movie that it does not rely on crass humour like other comedy films.",7,0,0,18 May 2014
American Gangster," Great Mob Movie
","Denzel Washington puts on one of his best performances in this top class mob movie. Based on a real life African American crime boss, this film succeeds in bringing his story to life. While other crime films focus on the Italian or Irish mafia scene the best being the infamous Godfather Trilogy this movie is highly original in telling the story of a Black Crime family. What's like with almost all truly great mob movies like Goodfellas or Casino is that the character is ambiguous looking out for his family. The times he is living in (70's) with the international dealers he has to deal with shows that the character has to make a living somehow and of course his violent tendencies is a big reveal into the real world of the mob as opposed to the exaggerated or gentlemen approach taken in other mob movies. The movie is full of action, suspense and mystery as the cops try to figure out who is behind the recent drug epidemic. This series foreshadows Breaking Bad which became a major series in the 00s. This movie is up there with the Godfather and Scarface in showing us how the criminal fraternity really operates.",9,2,4,26 April 2017
The Mission," A really enjoyable movie
","A Jesuit travels to the Americas to set up a mission and convert indigenous people to Christianity. Here he faces the savagery of the Slave Trade controlled by the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire seeking moderation by the Catholic Church.Jeremy Irons portrays a deeply holy man, Liam Neeson portrays a fellow Jesuit and De Niro portraying a Slave Trader turned spiritual man, together they inform the Cardinal of the horrible, cruel slavers while having him visit the home of the indigenous people who have constructed a church in the heart of the rainforest.This deeply moving film was interesting, thought provoking and true history. The music throughout is a combination of spiritual, choir and Native America music, a joy to listen to. Considering how it featured a fairly small cast and primarily focused on location and personalities. It was a great movie.",9,0,0,28 July 2014
The Lion King," Disney's Greatest
","This epic movie is the pride and joy of Disney. With an epic soundtrack and fine writing and casting the adventures of Sinba the Lion Prince and all his friends and family brings much joy and excitement to universal audiences. The religious significance of the Circle of Life is a core part of this masterpiece. The popularity is down to the message of the film but no film is complete without a villain the cruel and evil Scarface voiced by Jeremy Irons. Is one of the greatest villains ever seen! Not really an intimidating character, rather a master manipulator. Lion King if not the greatest animated movie ever released is among the top 10 greatest movies ever made.",Null,0,0,26 April 2017
Inception," Exceptional
","I can honestly say I have no idea what the movie was about but it was cool. The reasons being that the characters were all likable including Di Caprio who I don't like because he stars in to many Romance movies. Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy were was great while all the other cast members I know very little of but suited the film.This movie is about dreams so a more suitable name would have been the Dream stealers or something like that. Gotta say I liked what I saw. The plot was detailed with plenty of explanations, calculations and a world in which getting into somebodies dreams is a simple as turning on a light. I found it quite novel going through all the elaborate understandings of a fictional world in which people can wander into another persons dream or their own and start a life.Inception was Exceptional",8,0,1,16 September 2014
Halloween," The Original Halloween Story before remakes.
",Stalker and killer Michael Myers haunts Haddonfield Illinois in pursuit of Laurie Strode as Dr Sam Loomis is on the scene to put a stop to him. Classic horror movie typical of the late 70's. This epic movie began the whole Halloween franchise and of course the disturbing slasher films. A perfect film for Halloween. The imagery and atmosphere is perfectly suitable to this film. Without it the movie would be just about Michael the serial killer. The Halloween setting is ideal for a scary story such as this. Can't say I am a fan of slaher movies but in this case it was not very graphic so I would consider it a good movie that has a tolerable level of violence.,8,0,1,16 December 2014
Paths of Glory," Best WW1 Movie.
","Stanley Kubrick's Path of Glory is an Epic movie depicting military life in France during the First World War. Kirk Douglas plays the Colonel who leads his men into battle. An honest portrayal of the conditions that the men in the French uniform had to endure. The movie asks the audience to decide for themselves the morality of the officers show in the film.History has proved that this film is an accurate representation of French military justice contrary to opinions of anti war propaganda which would seek to deprive it of the respect it deserves,however when viewed through the lens of the present so much about the time it is set in is revealed. The General at heart is a soldier duty bound to uphold his principals. The deserter despite his lapse in judgement was most likely due to being warn down by the years of warfare. The executioner who was used to instil discipline in the army.This film is an excellent ww1 historical film. Regardless of the reasons for the war this tells a story of the hardship of that war. Long may it be remembered as a great movie.",10,0,1,25 August 2014
X-Men: First Class," Finally a Great X-Men Movie
","Alongside Days of Future's Past these are the best X-Men films with great music score. All of the characters are given a role and not just Logan, the Professor and Magneto. Seeing Beast is excellent as he is finally given more screen time. This movie gets the X- Men done correctly. Each of the team brought together are allowed to develop. The villain is not the most important part of the story and so does not take away from what is a story ultimately about the X-Men team. Using their powers to solve problems and actually showing scenes in which the X-Men are coming to terms with their abilities. Their actually shown as mutants with human frailties.",8,1,2,26 April 2017
Blade Runner," Masterpiece in Visuals.
","The film is dark dystopian and visually impressive. Harrison Ford stars in Blade Runner. Set in the mega futuristic City of LA, Rick Deckard is a former special cop who hunts down human looking Cyborgs called Replicants. In a city that is a blend of 19th century and 21st century architecture Deckard must reprise his role as a Blade Runner when a group of Replicants return to Earth seeking answers to their questions.Blade Runner was made at a time when the Sci Fi genre was just beginning with Star Trek, Star Wars and Alien all becoming major movies during that period of the late 70's early 80's. This film continues in that form. It combines the realism of Alien with the fantasy of Star Trek. Director Ridley Scott did a brilliant job in portraying a megacity. The costumes, feel and elaborate set up of the city exemplifies how a mega city would really look like. The Cyborgs running around as murderers, the night club and market places that are shown give us perspective on how the people on the streets behaved instead of just focusing on the skyscrapers. The characters lacked much of an impact on the movie since the sheer size of the city dwarfed their importance. Deckard becomes involved with Replicant women while the Geneticist responsible for creating these Cyborgs comes to a nasty end at their hands. This title is stunning to watch but very hard to understand. There is a similarity with other earlier Sci Fi movies, Metropolis being one. Thoroughly enjoyable seeing Harrison Ford play an excellent protagonist. He is particularly good in these movies because he is both an accomplished actor and can do these action packed scenes as well.",9,2,7,14 September 2014
X2: X-Men United," Improvement on the First
","A better movie all be it marginally of the first. More characters add up to make it very good and for films like X-Men all there is to it is action. Without the presence of two Shakespearean actors we would only see action and blowing things up scenes. X- Men can deliver great stories that are not confusing and a convoluted story arc which is what happened in X- Men 3.X- Men, X2, Wolverine & First Class are all fairly good movies hyped by certain quarters. All these X-Men movies were fairly good to begin with but the problem was they had so much more potential. You lose interest because the story was not good enough. Logan being the centre of the X-men universe is not a selling point in my eyes.",8,0,1,17 December 2014
Braveheart," Up Scotland
","A stunningly beautiful move that has no historical merit at all Mel Gibson has won the adulation of the world and most importantly the Scots. It captures the honour of the Scots. By today's standards the stereotypes are all in there. The prejudicial Irish, the dastardly English King so if your easily offended stay away from this film. But this film is about landscape, tragedy of lost romance and lots and lots of bloody violence. The action and costumes alone is what makes this film incredible. The movie is a giant re-enactment of ancient Anglo- Scottish rivalry. All Gibson did was point the camera at a beautiful countryside and have fun. So it is a truly exciting film.",7,5,8,26 April 2017
Moon," Pure Sci fi Gold
",Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell a clone stationed on a mining station on the moon in the mid 21st century. He is assisted by a machine voiced by Kevin Spacey. Cut off from the earth below and his beloved wife and daughter he becomes injured in an accident and subsequently learns that he is a clone.The story then proceeds to see the clone come face to face with another clone. The two come to realise that the station is a cloning facility and with the help of the machine they plot to escape and return to earth. Towards the end the one clone manages to reach earth but before breaking the communication jammer that prevents mining station from receiving incoming signals from earth. The next clone to awake will learn of the events transpiring on the surface.This film is hard hitting Sci Fi and with a minimum of cast members truly delivers an interesting story that is compelling right up to the end which goes to show you don't need a lost of characters to make movies work. The Blair Witch Project and many other small cast movies work just as well given a good story.,8,0,3,4 August 2014
Jurassic Park," Spielberg's Best Movie
","The movie that made Palaeontology cool. Jurassic Park written by Crichton is brought to life with Spielberg's animatronic Dinosaur models and thrilling chase scenes. This movie is exhilarating, fun and terrifying.The story is basically about monster lizards breaking out of their restraints after a disgruntled employer plans to steal Dinosaur genetic code having shut off the islands power on which they were residing on.The more detailed story is one of Dr Hammond a wealthy eccentric philanthropist setting up an amusement park off the Costa Rica coast and cloning the fossils of extinct Dinosaurs to fill the island with Terror Lizards like Velociraptor & T Rex. This crazy idea needs the backing of experts like Alan Grant, Ellie Sattle & Ian Malcolm to sign up on this but when the park is exposed to a combination of bad weather bad employees and bad engineering the entire system collapses and so the remaining people on the Island must traverse the Park dodging the Dinosaurs and escape to safety.All in all a great movie of the 90's.",10,3,4,25 May 2014
