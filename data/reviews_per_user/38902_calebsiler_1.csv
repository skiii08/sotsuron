First Man," A personal, moving film that lives up to it's potential.
","This is not your typical Hollywood space blockbuster. This is not Apollo 13 or Interstellar (though those are both great movies in their own right). It takes a little more patience to truly appreciate a movie like this, but boy is it worth it.First Man is a triumph, in that Chazelle tells the story of Neil Armstrong in such a unique way. It's a visual experience no doubt, and everything comes together to create a special movie full of special moments. The camera is the star, and we are forced to see this story up close (quite literally) and personal.Chazelle uses real, raw special effects, and sets the tone of each scene with dim, man-made lighting. He slowly peels back the story's layers, as we come to realize that this film is not about going to the moon, it's about Neil going to the moon. Ryan's Gosling and Claire Foy are exceptional as the Armstrongs, and show what the true price is for success.I always say that artsy movies catch our eyes, but a good story catches our hearts. First Man manages to do both. It gives us a beautiful shot of the atmosphere of Earth.... and then quickly cuts to the grim face of Neil. We are constantly reminded that Neil is going through this experience with us.The sub-plot about Neil's dead daughter is absolutely heart-wrenching, and we feel that burden pushing heavy at times. But it's the end of the movie where Neil finally comes to terms with this tragic event that nearly ruined his life. It's a single, masterful moment, and was the highlight of the move for me.First Man is an instant classic.Let's go through the checklist:Story: 10/10
