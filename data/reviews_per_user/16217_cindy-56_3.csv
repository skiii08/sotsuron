Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," positive
","After reading all the other comments, I agree with most.  Liam Neeson does a good job of acting, but the rest of the acting is so-so and the plot is weak -- but the movie is fun to watch, and there is a lot of humor.  Unlike some others, I enjoyed Jar Jar, though I couldn't understand him a lot of the time -- but I don't think we're supposed to.Basically, I thought the movie was fun.  One shouldn't compare it with the first 3 (though I agree with some others that the third was not as good as the first two).I hope Star Wars 2 has more (numerically) 'real' characters, characterizations and plots. The banter and attraction between Han Solo and Princess Leia in Star Wars I is one of the things that made it so enjoyable, and I'd like to see something like that in the sequel to Phantom Menace.Recommendation:  just relax and enjoy the movie for what it is (and the music).",6,0,1,29 April 2000

","A wonderful, unforgettable movie!  The acting is excellent, the stories are interesting, the plot is unique.  The ending can leave one wondering.  If you have not yet seen this movie, pay careful attention to the last prophecy.  An advantage of renting, of course, is that one can go back after the ending to replay the last prophecy, if needed, to form an opinion as to what happened at the end.",10,5,6,24 July 2000

","I agree with Ed Deeth's comments about the film except for the part about the accents.  Willing suspension of disbelief -- I think it would have been more distracting to have the actors attempt Russian and German accents possibly unsuccessfully, and perhaps the attempt would have distracted them away from their portrayals.  The only English accent I was really aware of was Sasha's. This was a wonderful and moving motion picture, and I was especially impressed with the acting of Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes.  I didn't  realize who the actors were, though they looked familiar.  They really became the characters, not themselves.  It's nice to see a new generation of young actors who can take on a variety of roles believably and not just be one type.  After the movie, when I realized who played Vasily and Danilov and thought about The Amazing Mr. Ripley and Shakespeare in Love, I was really impressed.  These two can be compared to Rod Steiger, Olivier, and a few others could play more than just one type of character.",10,1,2,17 March 2001
