The Expendables 2," When we were young...
","It happens often to me to lie on the couch and watch endless rubbish on HBO or on whatever channel is on, because I'm too lazy or not in the mood to get in touch with any movie in particular. However, when I decide to view a certain movie, most frequently it happens usually because it is directed by one of my favourite directors, and I really want to see it, and make some efforts for that.Exceptionally, for Expendables 2, my desire to see the movie was due to the cast - most of the heroes of my childhood and (partially) adolescence: the Lone Wolf, Terminator, Die Hard, Rambo, Universal Soldier, Transporter, to name only but a few... And to have them all together on the same stage - almost priceless!My taste in movies changed over the years, but I could not have missed this one. At least for the above reason. And the movie provides it all. For 102 minutes I felt like being a young boy again. Within the first 15 minutes, I couldn't eat my popcorn, as my eyes were wide open tied to the screen. Who cares about the story, about being politically correct, about moral discussions, etc... You have the heroes in front of you, doing what they know best, and that is getting the world rid of the bad ones, in their specific manner. I give this movie a rate of 9, and that is not about anything like the storyline, or the complex development of characters (which basically does not exist), but for my guilty pleasure of watching famous lines like 'I'll be back' and the likes.Plus, my girlfriend came with me to this movie basically as a favour to myself, but she had very similar feelings after it. So, if you are into it, go and immerse yourself in its atmosphere!",9,2,8,11 September 2012
Fargo," A philosophical approach that Tarantino misses
","I tried to find something to say about this movie; the problem is that it left me speechless; I compare it with other great movies I saw before; it is just great: go and see it! Definitely! Take a very common plot: a guy hires two villains to kidnap his wife; things do not go as planned. Seen it a thousand times. So, what's new? Well, it just keeps you in front of the screen, waiting to see what happens next. And you will be surprised, believe me. It lack the theatricals of a Tarantino movie (fans will know what I mean...), but, instead, offers a new approach of life, with almost nobody being surprised by anything, not shocked by most terrible crimes, nor by the behavior of the partners.",10,0,0,22 October 2005
