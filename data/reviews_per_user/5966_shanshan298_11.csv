Captain Phillips," Amazing
","The film's success is due to several reasons. First, directing himself, showing the sequence of events deft cinematic sweep and clarity screenwriter. Greengrass knows how to create a movie, and it makes use of sophisticated high points of the plot without having to be dragged showmanship balance. However, perhaps because of this, the result is very exciting, even if you know how the affair ended. For a long time I was not given so much tension while watching a movie like this.Another reason for the success of the film is the appearance of Tom Hanks, to Captain Phillips 'makes one of the best roles in his long career. This quality is due to acts of restraint that is being conducted throughout most of the film's attempt to connect and 'Captain Phillips' as a whole is expected to avoid the kind of heroic and commonplaces. Hanks plays the movie guru who does his job. He demonstrates efficacy but also some cold, but it reveals an essential component of professional effectiveness, especially in times of trial. Since Hanks conducted so throughout most of the film, the exposure of humanity and the fragility of the character he plays is so effective. I assumed the role of being the best player not notice the work and effort he invested in them, and to Captain Phillips, 'it's just a good movie, this ability comes from one of the peaks, even when restraint is replaced with emotion erupts.",10,0,3,22 February 2016
Unbreakable," Worst Movie
","worse Movie , barely finished it. I had many expectations for the film's director and creator , and he even played a small role there. Choosing the actors was good and you could see they were trying their best to get the best from the script, but the script just is not good! The story stretches on and on, not something that happens. It was really boring. Too bad, because it is an superb director who has a pretty good movie But this film is not one of them. Not recommended at all. even if you don't have nothing else to see. Not brilliant, not very smart, and no moral comes out of this movie . The only thing that when you think you have seen it is 'why I wasted my time on it?'",2,2,7,8 January 2016
American Beauty," great movie
","I've seen the film through the crush of Lester in Angela. This is childish infatuation, and based only on the fantasy of 'American Beauty'. But just like it returns to Lester the passion of his life. Lester tells us that the film's opening sequence, how his life monotonous and drab. He describes the kind of misery that suffering it is precisely because there is a narrow concrete must be solved, or a matter of survival. His suffering is the suffering of burial alive, Lester gave up on all those who felt that he be included bourgeois life to be in favor of medium and insufficient. At the beginning of the film he even tells us he does not want to live.Falling in love at youth as if it returns itself to be a teenager, and his youthful dreams he did not have time to realize. He buys the car he always wanted, and he returns to his old job as a teenager. His goal is not necessarily to achieve Angela. Angela is only a symbol, what Lester really want is to regain his self-esteem, and the feeling that he lives for himself and not for a model of how empty his life should show.Working at Burger Shop should just remove him from responsibility. He no longer requires office work, these are just a summer job as a teenager. In all these things Leicester turned down model of his former life, and prefers to concentrate its authentic dreams that somehow got stuck in a time he was a teenager and not evolved since.10/10 brilliant movie!",10,0,2,11 January 2016
Dallas Buyers Club," Nicely written
","The film elongates a little too much, dealing with bureaucracy and procedures for imports drop drugs across the border allowing them to remain interesting, and everything that is not pair of top players is not brilliant. McConaughey has always been good actor, with comic and dramatic ability, so Jared Leto and he manages to surprise me in every role he does.Jennifer Garner is usually a likable actress, but here she looks monotonous and annoying - perhaps simply because it is not in the league of actors next to her. when she's making a scene with McConaughey is like watching a child play basketball one on one in front of Michael Jordan. she's was just not good enough for this movie.",8,1,1,2 January 2016
American History X," Excellent movie
","I really liked the actor who played Danny. But Edward Norton, every film is a near-perfect with hes perfect acting skills. the role in this film is not a typical role for him, in the other movie he played. A lot of mixed feelings while watching the viewer. Between anger and compassion, the pity and hate, between love and disappointment. And Very moving ending. Somehow, after watching the film, it will be hard to stop thinking about him and connect with your real life. But I know it happened to me and I'm pretty sure it was everyone else watching this film. Just a masterpiece, giving you plenty to think. I liked a lot and cried a lot.",10,1,2,15 January 2016
Inside Out," great movie
","After two mediocre films perverse Pixar Studios making a hit original enough and charming for the parents. Five figures emotion Riley heroine's mind wonderfully decorated transfer messages sophisticated plot fun!A large part of the huge success of the film is the choice of informers central and certainly there is a winning team composed of young comic talent brilliant: happiness (Amy Poehler), fear (Bill Hader), anger (Lewis Black), disgust (Mindy Kaling) and sadness (Phyllis Smith). The forgotten childhood memory voiced by Richard Kind will cost you tears. Riley's parents dubbing Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan wonderful girl and Diaz Caitlin Reilly which is anonymous. grear movie go watch it, even if you'r adult.",10,5,30,31 December 2015
12 Years a Slave," Just excellent
","'12 Years a Slave' is based on the autobiography of Solomon Nortaf, published in 1853, eight years before the outbreak of the Civil War. Solomon , a violinist, lived as a free man with his wife and children in New York State. This distinction between free blacks lived in North America for those in the south is one of the most effective aspects of the film touches it. In general, silence is one of the most effective components McQueen's film. Small role in the film acted by Brad Pitt was totally unnecessary and they could take an unfamiliar actor and give him the stage. but it couldn't ruin this movie for me.'12 Years a Slave' is a film made of carefully seeking to to revive the discourse on slavery and is fully able to do it. warmly recommended 10/10 best movie of this year.",10,0,2,2 January 2016
Lord of War," Great film that has a lot of cynical humor too .
",No doubt Nicolas Cage gives his performance in this film the best since 'Leaving Las Vegas'. This is also the best appearance to date of Bridget Moinhan former model who plays his wife. Ninety-nine percent of American films there are dozens of people killed if not millions but never have a face. In this film Andrew Niccol makes sure we know who those bullets hitting. The balls have a face in this film and face are usually innocent women and children. After this film you'll get heavy hearts and understanding the arms trade will never stop as long as the governments of the industrialized countries can make a few bucks. Those weapons will find their way to get into the hands of bin Laden or Hezbollah and the cycle of violence will probably never stop.this is an amazing film with very strong and sharp criticism of the relationship of some Arab states recognized weapons to enemies of their enemies. warmly recommended.,9,0,1,1 November 2015
Her," Just an amazing movie
","The case of Theodore and Samantha is not unique, it turns out; People fall in love with their operating systems all the time - and why not? Why go into all the hellish impossible maze of relationships with other human beings, while at home - or in your pocket - waiting for you an ideal partner ? The change goes around the world, we're seeing through new releases or narration, but small details in the background; Through the technology around the world presented to Theodore, and through conversations and asides of the people around him. And what we see - Small, peering through a tiny pinhole and huge picture - is the society changed forever. In other words, it's a science fiction movie. Science fiction for real. Normally, sci-fi cinema is the background, cool decor action films or suspense. Here we are talking about a film looking to the immediate future, raises some educated guesses about what was going to happen, and ask tough questions and fascinating about them - questions that go to make less and less hypothetical, Probably more than you think early. It's one of the best science fiction movies ever created.",10,0,3,2 January 2016
Donnie Darko," I love movie that makes you think
","I do not know how to explain it, but the movie left me a strong taste of heavy psychology and headache bothered me about how the film is built step by step, the film basically a headache, but a good headache. The atmosphere of the film is really heavy, but let the top to be opened, the story behind the atmosphere is quite understandable, but from another perspective it records Head of Scinzofrni, do not know how to describe it, but the film depicts and Variation different to described in pointed and psychological rather, that just leaves you taste another end, which ended in late Mrs. relatively close. There are those who will join the movie will look behind the words 'cult film' A movie has being observed, but must open your mind for the film, otherwise it's another bad headache. When I left the movie, I felt good about myself, how the film is changing the rules now, he makes you feel how you are normal, as before the film you think you're not normal. Perfect cast, directing special about the movie over and from all sides, creates strange situations here to there, the goal of the film gives a goalkeeper, old feeling reinforces this film. Can not imagine a better film than psychological. The first time I really understand the lyrics of the song 'mad world'.",8,1,3,15 January 2016
Goodfellas," Very nice movie
","Very difficult and complicated to start thinking about which movie is the best of Martin Scorsese, I think there is no such a film, which always works great films of this soundtrack, just any movie right on the mark, the film is now in my opinion is much less appreciated what else out more movies like that and in my opinion ' Goodfellas 'is presented more as a kind of gangster comedy, a celebration of film that I think about crime drama I can think of' The Godfather 'and' City of God 'ranked after' good guys '(and rightly so), anyway, Director Scorsese's great with great decor, even cast fantastic and unexpected end, Overrated still too high and is located in IMDb Top 250 and still honor Scorsese with De Niro Liotta Joe outs and all the good guysThere are too many jumps between scenes in my opinion there is no real depth. Long film depicts a lifetime, but as the film shows a Mafia/ at least one crime in his life, I can note that when you do not manufacture and deepening interest in the characters, you just can not make a connection between the character and the viewer. Unfortunately, it happened to me.8/10 in my opinion",8,1,1,15 January 2016
