Come and See," War only leave victims
","Elem Klimov's 'Come and See' shows brutality and mercilessness of war. I think this film has no even plot. It just shows the horrors of war through a young boy who volunteer for a partisan. Also, a film has no heroism, no distinguishing oneself in war, and no impressive speech. There are just deaths, brutalities, and victims. Survival in war only depends on luck. Most war films are wanted to have elements of reversal, but at the same time they also are wanted to be heroism. However, in this film 'Come and See' does not have these elements at all. This film only tells us that there are no bad guys, good guys or justice in war. There is only one thing, victim.",8,0,0,9 February 2011
