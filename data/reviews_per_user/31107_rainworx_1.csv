The Monuments Men," We need so many more of these kinds of movies
","Amazing.....did I watch the same movie as all the negative viewers. This movie is definitely worth watching and very well made. Thank God for the men and women like Frank Stokes, Claire Simone, James Granger, Richard Campbell, Walter Garfield, Jean Claude Clermont (died for this rescue mission), Preston Savitz, Donald Jeffries (also died for this rescue mission) and Sam Epstein. All too often time forgets these important moments in history that should be remembered, including all those involved, who without them, we would not be able to enjoy these beautiful works of art all over the world. We need so many more of these kinds of movies. I say amazing work, very well done! 10/10 and more important than all of this....thank you And thank you actors and all involved.",10,2,7,2 May 2014
