The Avengers," Exceptional :
","This film is now part of those rare breed of films that entertain whole audiences. How often do you watch a film which makes everyone in the movie hall laugh together? For an action movie, the Avengers is definitely more. A great ensemble of actors - Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk was definitely a revelation, the best of the three we have already seen. Robert Downey Jr. as usual in his element - what would the Avengers be without him? And Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely brilliant.What makes this movie great is the realistic portrayal of a comic book series. The relationships built in the film between these superheroes were well thought out and show us the 'peopleness' in the characters and gives this movie a very personal touch. Watch this movie for the action packed entertainment it provides. A movie for all ages - this work of cinema will be talked about for decades and will put Marvel in the big league of Film production. DO NOT MISS THIS!",10,2,6,30 April 2012
