Iron Man 3," 10 legitimate things wrong with the movie
","*** CONTAINS SPOILERS **** 1) How foolish, in the first 10 minutes of the movie he gets his house blown up because he felt like making an open threat and tells his girlfriend that he's sorry for putting her in harms way.2) Does iron man, the king of technology, have no sophisticated security measures for his house? He used to make weapons of war..3) He was barely actually iron man through the entire movie, and even when he was, him or his suit failed. He was more like undercover hoodie man.4) This is Tony Stark, the guy who created iron man in a cave, now the only thing he could make in a shack were some inspector gadget toys to knock out security guards.5) The mandarin. Simply, what a joke. Started off strong, and should have been maintained.6) The main evil, those fire zombies, were pretty lame. Also, come on, one touch and they incapacitate iron man? Iron man fought Thor..7) His girlfriend saves the day!! Because we all came to watch 'Iron Man's Girlfriend 3' 8) When Pepper 'dies', he's momentarily devastated followed up by being totally oblivious to what had just occurred.9) The surgery to get his arc reactor removed? He didn't think about that before? Was it really that easy? When it was killing him in the second movie and when he said that he is cursed with it in Avengers, where was this option then? Medical breakthrough?10) Don't stay after the credits. You think you should, as a superhero movie tradition. Tony is telling the story of this movie to Dr. Banner who falls asleep in the meanwhile out of boredom.. That's it (though it reveals something about the quality of the movie). It's like they were mocking you for waiting.Overall, for an iron man fan, this movie was a total let down and offending. There was too much tom and jerry humor at the expense of the main character, who we all want to see in action. It failed to live up to iron man's capturing movies. Seemed like it should have been animated. Otherwise, if there were no expectations involved, the movie was just entertainment.",5,2,4,24 May 2013
