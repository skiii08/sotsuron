Black Swan," Do believe the Hype (I can't believe I just said that)
","I'm always wary when a director I really care about hits it big time cause we've been let down before but Aronofsky actually pulls it off. Nothing here that you haven't seen before one way or the other: A struggling ballet dancer on the verge of her breakthrough; an unhealthy mother-daughter dependency, an alter ego in the shape of a beautiful competitor, an aging star that goes berserk, yet everything about this film comes together beautifully: the script, the acting, the pace, but what I cared about most was the subtle camera-work. For instance, in the grand finale, the opening night of Swan Lake when it's all of nothing for our enduring heroine, the temptation would be to employ a great many camera movements with dolly and cranes and whatnot inter-cut with an awestruck audience when Nina dances her way to towards the climax but Aronofsky resists the temptation and instead relies on a refreshing down to earth approach with hand-held cameras that make you really feel as if you were part of the action. Likewise he avoids all the inevitable clich√©s with breathtaking finesse. At the core of this lies Nina's madness and the only film I can think of that matches the creepy feel of Black Swan would be Polanski's Rosemary's Baby. How she catches her mirror reflection scratching at her back or the scene where her toes have grown together are just the tip of the iceberg. Natalie Portman does a really great job of portraying this desperately eager dancer. Her intense acting allows Aronofsky to plunge right into the action instead of taking his time to build up the character, thus the film clocks in at a little over 100 minutes, which I find really admirable cause I reckon everyone else had dragged it out at least for 2 hours. Why can't there be more mainstream movies like this.",9,1,2,16 October 2011
Empire of the Sun," Ignorance is Bliss
","Steven Spielberg is a funny guy. He wants us to believe that the dropping of the first nuclear bombs that resulted in the death of 250 000 people, mostly civilians, was like 'God taking a photograph'. Hey, Mass Murder of Women and Children is great, if it means that this poor little American kid finally gets something to eat. How arrogant can you get, really? This film illustrates nicely why American movies are every so often of little interest to anyone outside of America, especially if they deal with international themes. Never ever occurs it to anyone involved that there is probably a view apart from that of the western world, and so the whole complexity of the Chinese/Japanese war is reduced to how much fun our jolly British fellow has in the Prisoners Camp. Oh yeah, and the boy is pretty annoying, though I bet he's supposed to represent the curious and adventurous spirit of the white upper class. John Malkovich is the only redeeming quality as far as I can tell.",4,6,15,30 June 2014
Dunkirk," Heroes and errrr, more heroes
","I for once think that Nolan is painfully overrated. True, he did two top notch movies, but everything that came after 'Following' and 'Momento' I found rather average. In fact, I had the distinct feeling that he lost it along the way, so when the rave reviews for Dunkirk came in, I decided to give it another go and see if I had to reevaluate.
First of all, Dunkirk looks amazing, great cinematography, but so do heaps of other films that come out today. Everything else left me slightly deflated. Especially the corny music.
Seriously I thought you would need a slightly more original approach, if you wanted to belt out another WWII Movie in 2017. For some strange reason I was expecting something I hadn't seen a so many times before. I was hoping for the unbearable pain of waiting on the beach. Instead you get you run of the mill war stories complete with the heroic spitfire pilot, the patriotic old guy, the noble admiral, the good hearted rookie. You get the dive bomber attack, you get the running out of fuel problem, you get the 'oh-my-god-I-m-sinking-and-this-hatch-is-stuck' cliffhanger, you get the sinking ships, emergency landings, getting saved in the nick of time. I don't know, as my understanding, the evacuation of Dunkirk was spectacular and unique. Unfortunately, this film isn't.",5,0,0,29 December 2017
The Intouchables," too corny for my taste
","Isn't this movie rather racist, seeing that the black guy is portrayed as violent, horny, unsophisticated, rude and criminal. And the guy that this character is based upon wasn't even black to begin with. But of course, being black, he can dance like there is no tomorrow. But what the heck, stereotyped aside, I found this whole venture far too predictable and aiming at easy laughs. Like when he sold the black guy's painting for 11000 Euro or making fun of the Opera. Sure the majority of people have no interest in modern art or opera, but if you want to make fun of those, does it always have to be that straightforward?Also, when Driss starts working at the posh place, he needs only a couple of days to become friends with everyone, a few misunderstandings, but from then on the two oh-so-different people get along so fine, that you might wonder where the drama is. Oh right, it's a comedy. So the black guy threatens the daughter's ex-boyfriend into bringing croissants to the mansion each day. Because obviously, threatening other people is another thing that black people are really good at. So this teenager apparently feels threatened enough to bring croissants to these overly rich people very day. Says the housekeeper one morning: Can you bring some more tomorrow because we're having a brunch? Like, if you dig that kind of humour, you might really enjoy this movie, but if you hated 'Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis' as much as I did, you're in for a big disappointment.",4,6,11,27 March 2016
Jurassic World," No Surprises
","Look, I enjoyed this film, OK. Dramawise everything was in place and the two kids were so unlikable, that you actually enjoyed when they were getting the scare of their lives. Of course, the plot is a tad too predictable in that it just recycles the story line of old Jurrasic flicks, i.e., greed trumps common sense and safety last. There is just one thing that doesn't make sense at all. If the marketing team of Jurassic World is in desperate need for a new Park sensation, why oh why design a Dinosaur that looks and behaves pretty much like the T Rex. I get it, they need that for the final Boss Fight, but there it becomes so blatantly obvious that the new monster is exactly like the old monster, so much as I had trouble to figure out which one was which.",6,0,0,23 February 2017
Inception," What went wrong? Nolan was rather promising 10 years ago.
","What a let down. Due to the hype and exuberant reviews I had expected something akin to Eternal Sunshine or at least something not totally unlike The Matrix. Instead we get something like 'the Cell' without the lush imagery, but with plot holes so big that even Jorge Garcia would drop through them. So what is it that makes this film so mediocre. 1. The shoot outs and action scenes. Seriously, I've seen better in James Bond films from the early eighties, even if you deem this to be impossible. But what makes those scenes so utterly annoying is that there is no purpose to them whatsoever other than to appeal to people who like to see things go 'bang' and no doubt play first-person shooters in their bedrooms. Those guns don't propel the story forward a single inch.2. The cast. Nothing happens between Leonardo and Marion. There is no spark, no chemistry, thus you can't really understand why Leonardo would consider staying in a dreamworld just to be together with his old flame that he doesn't seem to have any affection for when she was alive.3. The Alibi cutie. If you eliminate Allen Page from the script, no-one would spot the difference. Honestly folks, if the architect of a dream landscape is so important and the wrong fabric of a bathmat can thwart the success of a mission, why don't we get any insight of how this whizz kid designs those dreamscapes and what makes her so indispensable. If we had any inkling what exactly she was doing there apart from looking pretty she would have been far less annoying.4. The aforementioned holes in the plot. Too numerous to mention here, just think about this: if someone who has a dream in a dream and in the first dream he sits in a van that drops down a bridge, there is no logical way he would be weightless in the second dream cause physically he doesn't sit in the van and mentally he doesn't know about the moments without gravity. Dreams just don't work like that and it is an insult to peoples intelligence to suggest that they do.But if all that was not enough, there is so much more inconsistency here, like for instance, why would a tycoon who has the money to buy up entire airlines and the power to overrule the judicial system in America be so utterly afraid of some healthy competition that he risks being lost in his dreamworld for more than thirty years? I think 'good clean fun-loving popcorn movie' is just an euphemism for brainless mainstream crap from America but what is even worse is brainless mainstream crap that claims to be sophisticated. This film certainly is not.",4,28,53,31 August 2010
The Blind Side," well meant probably, but racist crap all the same
","What is wrong with American Cinema lately? In the old days there would have been drama, passion and suspense in a story like this, today its just goodness all around. That probably makes for a better world, but sadly enough adds up to a rather boring night at the movies. This film has nothing to tell, apart from how great the white American upper middle class is, and I find it surprising that even people in America should be interested in such blatant propaganda. So you might argue, that this tells a true story, but if the story had been that dull to begin with, they either should have put some excitement in it or made a film about my next door neighbor, who's done nothing out of the extraordinary, but who's life is by all accounts more interesting than that of Michael Oher, if this film is anything to go by. But what really pisses me off is the thinly disguised racism that seeps in halfway through. So this big, black kid gets adopted by these nice white folks, who never fight, never have any arguments whatsoever. The big black kid wants a driving license, he gets a driving license, and you know what, because our nice rich white family is so generous, they buy him a pick up truck to go along with it. So he takes their little white son for a drive around the block and crashes the car big time, but do our white parents so much as bat an eyelid and feel any resentment against the big black kid. On the contrary, they are apparently very grateful as he selflessly prevented the son from being injured more severely. Surprisingly enough, no one in this family has ever any issues with this traumatized, rather morose black fellow moving in on short notice. In fact, both kids are rather fond of him straight away. Whatever happened to Douglas Sirk? He could have turned this story around. With John Lee Hanncock it's utterly hopeless. There is just no conflict whatsoever. Everyone gets along like a house on fire. Wait, wait, I forgot, there is Michael's mother (black) who comes across as rather irresponsible and Michael's old buddies (black) who are portrayed as violent, lazy and rude. But as Michael doesn't feel any ties to neither of them, everything would be fine, if it wasn't for an investigator form the National Collegiate Athletic Association (black, what a surprise) who suspects that Michael has been forced to chose a certain University for his career as a football pro. Do you care? We neither do I. The more since American Football must be one of the most boring sports and I wish they would stop making films about this folly.",2,16,32,5 April 2010
