Miracle," Predictable as expected, but hardly fun along the way
","After seeing the trailers for this film, I walked in with a very vivid expectation of what I would see.  Miracle truly didn't disappoint in this aspect, but unfortunately that's the only way in which it didn't disappoint. Miracle delivered a truly predictable sports flick that didn't even really make the journey very much fun.There are many many films in the sports movie genre, leading to played and replayed stories with smarmy, milked endings.  This one was no exception. Sometimes they can be pulled off without seeming heavy-handed or trite, but other times, they just turn out schmalzy and boring.  This tried story of a has-been-turned-coach having to deal with a team made up of a group of argumentative Hollywood hotties and the ensuing lives changed and unity formed contains exactly every single element the sports movie formula requires.  Honestly, I expected Emilio Estevez to arrive at any moment and instruct the players to initiate the Flying V maneuver and win the game.Aside from the thematic issues, there were technical indiscretions as well. As far as editing goes, you could tell what they were going for, with the constant cuts back to the timer and the extreme closeups, but it just didn't seem to add anticipation, just confusion.  Furthermore, the extended overuse of close shots often led to confusion as far as blocking and where characters were in relation to other characters in a scene, lacking some serious establishing shots.  Still, there were SOME good acting moments, particularly on the part of Kurt Russell, who pulls off a relatively brilliant Coach Herb Brooks.  The kids were all right for the most part (was it just me and my companions, or did a lot of those kids look almost identical?), but their characters still seemed at times overworked.In the end, it was all right, exactly what I expected, so I can't say I was disappointed.  But what I CAN say is it's a good thing America won, or else they wouldn't be worthwhile individuals, or so the sports world would have you believe.  'It doesn't matter if you win or lose....'  Hm.  That theory seems lost on America as of late.5/10.",Null,0,0,13 February 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Hardly watchable
","Being the male chick-flick fan that I am, I went to this with my girlfriend expecting something cute and maybe memorable.  I don't think I can sit through one more Matthew McConaughey movie ever again.  I did not believe for even ONE second that he was a marketing man from New York.  Not a chance.  He is (and always oozes) a hick from Smalltown, Texas, which worked for EdTV and even Contact, but not for this and not for The Wedding Planner. Every time he opened his mouth to speak, I wanted to punch it in.  Plus, the Princess Sophia/Krull the Warrior King bit was TOO TOO lame. 
This movie's saving grace was Kate Hudson's believable and tossed-to-and-fro journalist Andie Anderson.  She was darling enough to make up for McConaughey's looks over talent casting misstep.  The supporting cast's performances, I thought, were ghastly (especially the two nasty Judys and Ben's friends at times).  It was worth watching once, I suppose, but in the end, another weakish chick-flick.  One chick-flick that came out recently that I recommend far more is Two Weeks Notice (which provided far more than a standard formulaic chick-flick).",Null,0,0,30 March 2003
Independence Day," A poor film, Jeff Goldblum saved what he could.
","This film was okay, but fairly poor, despite fine acting and patriotic themes.  My feelings against Will Smith (and his obvious ego) were solidified and even more so with Men in Black and its horrendous sequel. Smith was absurd as the war hero, Pullman was passable as the president (although I found his life-changing speech canned), but Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, and Randy Quaid's characters made the whole affair bearable.  Watch it on TV if you must, but don't bother renting it.",Null,0,1,7 March 2003
Remember the Titans," Not even Denzel could save this one for me
","I didn't like this film, not because it was 'Disney drivel', as I usually immensely enjoy nearly all Disney films (more particularly the animated ones and live-action of old), but because it was thoroughly predictable and didn't really tell a new story.  Of course, it's not a true story (it never said it was, it said it was BASED on a true story), but it felt played and tiresome.  I like moral movies that have football in them, but this was a football movie with a touch of morality in it (the same reasons The Rookie didn't really work for me and many I know, but substitute football for baseball).  *Yawn*  The real reasons I didn't enjoy this had to do with the Sunshine character and his gratuitous kiss with the captain of the football team, but I won't go much into that.  I hate when people use these reviews as podiums to voice their outrageous and unfounded opinions.  All in all, Denzel Washington (who I find acts identical in nearly every role, with the exception of facial hair or the occasional fro) couldn't even save this movie for me.  I thought the daughter of the coach was the best part.2.3/10 for a SLIGHT glimmer of a moral message.",Null,0,1,28 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A truly miraculous experience
","After I was truly blown away by The Two Towers, I could only dream of what I could expect from The Return of the King.  Always a fan a Tolkien's work, I had considered the first two films absolute masterpieces, incredible and unsurpassed (or unsurpassable) cinematic achievements, and was far from disappointed with the end of the trilogy.  It's hard to believe that the quest is over, and that the whole trilogy ended up so brilliantly, but there it is.  I really wasn't going to post on here, just because there are always so many, mine wouldn't make a difference, but this film moved me so much, I just had to let everyone know.Let it be known, first and foremost, I'm not a 'Ring Nut,' nor did I attend the midnight showing in New Zealand in costume (or anywhere else).  Still, I did go on opening night, and I was definitely pumped, (and I really believe in the difference between crazy scary LotR fans and cool LotR fans).  From Smeagol's first encounter with the Ring to the Cracks of Doom and beyond, this film is as close to perfection as I've ever seen, or that I imagine I'll ever see.  I really wish I could describe how this movie made me feel, even days later, but it's beyond words.  It's beyond awards, it's beyond Hollywood.  The idea that anything else this year (or any other year) could beat this film in any Oscar category is truly laughable.  Music, effects, acting, editing, directing, adaptation, screenplay, cinematography, name it.The only few and little complaints I've heard about this film are unfounded and hardly credible.  From the Fellowship to the Return, there is so much character and relationship development and story it's above scrutiny.  With one gesture, one expression, nearly every actor on screen evokes an entire pantheon of emotions, letting everyone watching know exactly what they're thinking and feeling, and making a truly believable world.  Most notable are Ian McKellan's inspiring Gandalf, Sean Astin's incredible Sam and of course, Elijah Wood's ever-burdened and continually tortured Frodo.  The development of Frodo's character from start to finish alone is a paramount achievement. The screenplay is poetic and poignant, something I'm positive Tolkien would more than approve of.  The cast and crew truly seem to respect the material they were working with and the expectations they were facing.  Also, the ending, though long (although you'd never know it while you're watching until you glance at your watch on the way home, heck, I never wanted it to end!), is perfect.  Don't forget there are three movies' worth of resolution to make up for.  It could not possibly have ended better.  It was a perfect bookend to the prologue at the start of the Fellowship of the Ring.  Nobody felt cheated, everyone found out and loved what happened, and Frodo finally found peace.For me, the Lord of the Rings are incredible films with intense action sequences and stunning visual effects, but they're far more than that. While I know Tolkien didn't intend any blatant symbolism (especially about Sadam Hussein and the War in Iraq or ecology and tree-hugging), I do know that fantasy has inherent allegorical qualities, no matter how hard you try to deny it.  Frodo's quest means more to me than I think any other cinematic experience, so while I felt a little silly getting crazy over what is ultimately 'just a movie,' I realized that I learned and grew from it, so I don't feel dumb after all.  There are truly lessons to be learned from the Quest to destroy the One Ring about society, relationships, loyalty, and of course faith and hope.  I defy anyone to deny that.I know there are those who will argue that this is without a doubt the greatest movie (and trilogy) ever made, but there are those who will defend it as well.  Moreover, they'll tell you to keep your Godfather, your Citizen Kane, and your Matrix.  Sure, they really are great films, it's just that The Lord of the Rings are beyond comparison.  They're on a completely different level, another plane.  Just watch this movie and I am positive, if you're not narrow-minded (or otherwise retarded) you will truly be uplifted, moved and inspired.  The makers of this film did everything just right.  I can't imagine a better end to the Ringbearer's quest.All in all, it was pretty good and I can't wait to see it again... :)",Null,0,1,18 December 2003
