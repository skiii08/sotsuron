Casablanca," Escape the Chaos in Europe
","Regarded by some as one of the greatest movies ever written, Casablanca will sure not let you don't. The film really became a part of history, because it was shot around World War II. In the one bar in this movie, you saw people in neutral territory trying to escape the chaos in Europe. The performances were excellent from Rick (Humphrey Bogart) to the French and Germans. The film was shot in black and white but, the characters were so colorful. The scenes have very low lighting and there was a very smoky look. A spotlight shined so bright that you could see it pointed in front of Ricks bar and the inside as well. This was definitely a love story, one of the best that I ever seen.",9,1,2,30 March 2014
Citizen Kane," Those last words
","This film deserved to be seen in the theater with friends, not at home. When I saw this film I was unprepared by the excessive background information. It is a story about a man who was very wealthy,that's really all you need to know. If you enjoy films just take the time to see this one. Have fun using your imagination, think of this man's life, think of your own and think of what the director is trying to create. I hope your first time seeing Citizen Kane will be enjoyable.The second part of the plot was shorter but it's a key part of the film. It starts with a shot of Kane, at this point we do not know who Kane is), drops a snow globe whilst delivering the words 'Rosebud', and then the snow globe rolls down some steps and smashes on the floor and Kane dies. Then after his death a newspaper journalist is sent around to talk to Kane's associates to find out what rosebud could possibly mean. The conversations between the journalist and Kane's associates turn into flashbacks which forms the whole film wonderfully and create an unpredictable story that it would be almost impossible to not follow.",9,1,2,31 March 2014
Taxi Driver," Taxi Please!!!!!!!!!!!
","Wow. DeNiro was a joy to watch throughout the movie, this was my first time watching it. I will never forget the scene where he walks through the crowded city streets of New York, a look of pain and disconnection clear upon his face. In the moment Deniro was definitely Travis no question about it. The grittiness of what New York City use to be was a great back drop for the movie. It is this ambiguity that makes Taxi Driver such an engaging and intelligent film, as the viewer has to think for themselves about who Travis Bickle is, and what his motivations are. The acting, casting and cinematography of this film are all excellent. What else can I say this was a great piece of work by Martin Scorsese.",9,0,0,9 May 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," A family struggles during the time of the Great Depression
","Wow I tell you I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The film shows a family from Oklohoma as well as many others who lost their land to the bank. As a result the family packed up their run down truck, and headed west to California to find work. During the voyage some of the elders from the family passed away. The film showed the difficulties that people experienced during the Great Depression, as you saw other families in camps waiting for a place to go next. The look of the movie was out standing, it gave you a good idea what the middle and west of America looked like. The people struggled to find shelter to live and money to eat, but they didn't give up. The whole time that I watched the movie, I was wondering if they're truck was going to make it the whole way to California.",9,0,1,31 March 2014
The Graduate," Next step after College?
","Growing up watching different television shows like Seinfeld, I've always heard references to Mrs.Robinson but I did not know who she was. Mrs. Robinson was a married middle age woman who through herself on a newly graduated college student. Mrs. Robinson and the graduate played by (Dustin Hoffman) started having a sexual relationship. The editing of the film was really good: there was a scene where Mrs. Robinson passed back and forth in front of the camera and each time she did so you knew that, they just finished having sex with out seeing it. Another time when Mrs. Robinson showed frontal nudity of her chest, it was cut so fast that you didn't see it for long.",Null,0,0,8 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Colors and Singing
","Usually I'm never in the mood to watch a musical movie beside West side Story, but I must say Singing in The Rain caught me off guard. From the beginning I thought it was so funny and that was consistent all throughout the movie. Not only was the singing fun to watch but the dancing with also great. The movie looked so uniformed that it looked like a few long takes, and some dolly shots.There are so many scene where even the background adds to the visual performance. One of the most important things in this movie was bright colors. Prior to this movie color film wasn't around for that long, and too see how colorful the movie was and nice lite there is no wonder why this is one of the best visually looking films.",8,0,1,8 May 2014
Pulp Fiction," Star studded
","This is truly one of the greatest crime/drama films of all time. When I was going up I never saw the movie, just some of the action clips. The Pulp Fiction poster might be more famous then the actual movie. This film has to be hands down Tarantino's master piece, it had everything from action, humor,and originality. We must not forget about how great the performances were from Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta,Ving Rhames, and Bruce Willis. I would definitely recommend this too all my friends.The many stories of this film, Tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order, not to leave confusion but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialog between characters.",9,0,2,9 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," We're off to see the wizard
","What a great movie I think more people have seen The Wizard of Oz, then an movie in cinema history. I remember seeing this as a kid and it never got old to me. Sometimes you watch a movie and you may forget about the characters, or different scenes but not this one. This film also became a musical on Broadway, that's how beloved it was. We forget about the little songs we learned growing up like,' We're off to see the Wizard the wonderful Wizard of OZ'. The film was so colorful from the background to the characters, the only thing that was dark was the witch and wizard. The lion, the tin man,the straw man, Toto, and Judy Garland as Dorothy from themselves walking on the yellow brick road to see the wizard.The imagery was absolutely magnificent, and you can't forget about the effect of the house spinning and lifting off the ground.",9,5,7,31 March 2014
