Casablanca," Looking back, feeling strange.
","Wow, please fasten your seatbellts. Nazi's losing theirselfs in a whirlpool of violence on the continent, a corrupt Vichy (loving-hating)French police prefect? An American dropped from Paris into Casablanca, after having supported the underdog in spain, delivered weapons in Ethiopia, now running a nightclub. Cultures mixed together arabs, russian, csezhs, a black pianist. We heard the Reichs hymne en the Marseillaise as time went by.So many live were is such danger, countless people searched for a better life, noone could expect what lay ahead. But Rick and Ilsa had a memory, a secret, a lost love on which both of them tried to hold on, and then again she had to let go. He wouldn't let go, but let her go. A description of love that no longer can hold. We know better now. At the end even the bad guy turned out to going to be the partner in Brazzaville. Looking back, felt strange. It made me happy that I grew up in the seventies.",Null,1,2,30 November 2003
