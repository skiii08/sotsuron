First Man," Disappointing
","I was looking forward to this film on a number of areas, however whilst it's an ok movie it disappoints overall . To start with it's really slow moving and I get that it's more focused on Armstrong than the actual event I don't think it delivers on that aspect.I don't want to pan my areas of disappointment just wished I'd waited for it to come on Foxtel so that I didn't waste my $$$ at the cinema.",6,1,2,15 October 2018
