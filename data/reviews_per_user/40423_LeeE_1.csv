The Ring," Prepare yourself!
","I got the chance to see this movie at an early screening and it was amazing. I haven't seen the original but this movie is outstanding. From the first 10 minutes of the movie your heart rate jumps to 160 and stays there for the next two hours. This movie stands alone as one of the scariest movies I've seen. Everything a good horror movie needs, this has. Note: it's not at all a slasher filled with mindless gore but an extremely well thought out screenplay.  Naomi Watts performance is as riveting as it is different from her character in 'Mulholland Dr'. Unusually, out of the entire cast there was no weak link. Every one gave a strong, believable performance. This movie is definitely one of the better movies of the year. The high contrast, shades of grey look of the film perfectly accentuates the stark images. The story, sound and cinematography combine to deliver chills that will stay with you long after you've seen the movie. It is truly a visceral experience.",9,1,2,2 October 2002
