E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I understand the praises It has recieved through all these years
","First time I see this classic piece of North American cinema and I have to say that I understand the praises It has recieved through all these years.
It was charming and funny, but not just that. Steven Spielberg's directing, John Williams' score and Allen Daviau's cinematography were excellent.Watching it on big screen was an absolute blast. The whole audience had a terrific time.",10,1,1,1 February 2020
1917," 1917, it's not that great
","On one hand we have; solid acting, great costume and production design and good cinematography (especially during the 'flare night' scene). On the other one the script was effective, at times, but very simple, and directing and editing were going for a one take type of film which they didn't take It to It's logical extreme cuting in obvious moments.
However, the only things I'm sure we all agree will be the bad CGI and the overused and annoying music that was anything but helpful for the experience except for a couple of scenes.I have to say tho It is pretty hard get an immersive experience from a movie If you spend first 30 minutes smelling popcorn and hearing how people eat and drink like animals. And, ofcourse, not watching a great movie helps I guess.",10,1,2,16 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Funny
","Funny. Premise, script, acting, everything in this movie is funny.
It is hard to believe that at some point halfway through the movie there is an event that makes you hold your breath for a few minutes like It does.
In this one Taika Waititi goes for a more Wes Anderson like directing and framing than I remember from his previous films, but you can tell he is behind the project beacuse of the humour It emantes.
Overall It was an absolute joy to watch and I would like to make an special mention for Scarlett Johansson who managed to bring to live a character that acts like 3 different people but yet feels real in this crazy universe.If you are fond of Taika Waititi's humour don't miss It.",10,3,8,18 January 2020
