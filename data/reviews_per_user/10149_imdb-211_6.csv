The Incredible Hulk," Great action flick, but ultimately predictable
","When the first modern Hulk adaptation came out in 2003, most people were disappointed. This wasn't the Hulk they expected; this was a deep character with an interesting story, a movie with fantastic screenplay and great actors, but few and barely mediocre action scenes. And action scenes was what the fans wanted.So the movie was seen as a failure, and plans were made to relaunch the franchise, giving people the movie they wanted in the first place; a movie that can be summarized in two words: 'Hulk Smash!'The Incredible Hulk is out, and it's a great movie. It's quite the fan service: it has the typical Hulk lines, it has tons of action scenes, it has incredible CGI, and it has the obligatory even stronger villain who ultimately must lose because he does not have the power of good on his side, and it has purple underwear. On the minus side, The Abomination looks nothing like the comic version, and some of the acting is ridiculously bad, with actors standing there staring into nothingness as if they were waiting for instructions from the director. Some actions scenes are cut too quickly, which makes it hard to figure out what exactly is going on, but since that has become the norm for Hollywood movies, it may be a bit unfair to blame The Incredible Hulk for it.Still, it's a great movie, but because it's exactly what people wanted, it's ultimately incredibly predictable. Ang Lee's Hulk was fascinating, challenging and innovative. Leterrier's Hulk is cookie cutter. When people will talk about 'the Hulk movie' in a decade or so, they will talk about Ang Lee's Hulk, not Leterrier's Hulk.As a mindless summer popcorn action flick, The Incredible Hulk is a winner. As a work of art, as a contribution to the Hulk mythology, as something that challenges its viewers, it's a failure.",6,2,5,2 August 2008
The 13th Warrior," Lots of promise, but too short
","I really want to like this movie. It shows lots of promise, the scenery is beautiful and the actors are first rate. Unfortunately, it falls short on a few fronts:First, the movie is just too short. A lot of the story just doesn't make sense. I guess the book is more elaborate, but the movie should at least be twice as long to help give the story some kind of flow instead of making it look like more or less unrelated scenes stitched together.And then there are the fight scenes. They're just no good. Nowadays that we have movies like The Matrix, fight scenes that change so quickly that you have no idea what's going on just doesn't cut it anymore. I had no idea what was going on during the fights, who was fighting against whom or why anything was happening at all (actually, I had that feeling during most of the movie).If you have an hour and a half to waste and this movie is on TV, by all means watch it, but don't bother buying or renting the DVD.",3,0,2,10 February 2002
The Dark Knight," To my own surprise, I did not like The Dark Knight
","There must be something wrong with me, because I didn't like The Dark Knight. There, I said it. I didn't like it.I mainly didn't like it because it was not at all what I expected from a Batman movie, and not the sequel I expected after Batman Begins. The Dark Knight didn't feel like a comic book movie, it felt like 'The Thin Red Line' featuring the Batman. I was disappointed.The movie felt far too intense and unsettling. I felt genuinely disturbed after the movie ended. Perhaps that was Nolan's intention, but it isn't what I want out of a comic book movie.The Joker is everyone's favorite Batman villain, and he always had some flamboyant aspect to his personality. Not here; here, he's just deranged and creepy. Too real and plausible.There were too many characters, and some characters were poorly defined. Furthermore, the story was too convoluted. It's great to see more complex stories in a comic book adaption, but this felt too close to Nolan's earlier works like Memento or The Prestige for my taste. While I love these two movies, it's not what I want from a Batman movie.Finally, while Aaron Eckhart did an awesome job playing him, Two-Face simply looked a bit dumb, reminding me of a poor 80s zombie flick. He's supposed to have half of his face cauterized, not outright removed.It's not a bad movie by any means. It's just not a very good Batman movie.",6,6,14,25 August 2008
Dark Shadows," Unlikable hero, mostly entertaining movie
","Dark Shadows was mostly entertaining, apart from some slow parts, and an overdone, unmotivated ending.But what struck me most about the movie was how twisted its 'ethics' were. Basically, the movie's 'hero' is a horrible person, and, by the way, a serial murderer. The 'villain', on the other hand, is a woman who started out as a maid, was abused by her employer (the aforementioned 'hero'), and founded a company that eventually put her former employer's company out of business. The 'happy ending' of the movie is the 'hero' murdering her, presumably in retribution for her crime of being 'uppity'.Along the way, there's also a female doctor, whom he murders because she tries to become a vampire. Yet he has no particular issues turning his girlfriend into a vampire later on, to prevent her from dying.All of this made it very hard for me to identify with the movie's ostensible hero. It's sometimes fun to root for the bad guy, but when it becomes obvious that the bad guy is actually the good guy, while the good guy is a horrible person, the whole thing can quickly turn into a very frustrating experience.",3,2,4,30 July 2012
WALL·E," Simply Astonishing; Truly a Triumph
","It's obvious that Pixar's movies have become more sophisticated with every iteration in almost every way, but even given their previous work and my expectations, WALL·E is truly outstanding. This movie exists in an entirely different galaxy, quite simply just blowing away every other animated movie released recently - and, in fact, almost every live-action movie released recently.WALL·E is one of the most astonishing movies I've ever seen. A little bit of 2001, Brazil, Starship Troopers, Soylent Green, and a whole lot of Douglas Adams. In an animated movie. Suitable for children. With almost no spoken dialog.This movie truly is a triumph.",10,0,2,29 November 2008
Warcraft," Surprisingly Entertaining
","After reading the terrible reviews, and not being a fan of the World of Warcraft games, I went into this movie with very low expectations. Initially, the low expectations seemed to be appropriate. The movie introduces a number of different characters in a rather haphazard way, barely explaining what they do or why we should care.Similarly, there's very little world building in the beginning, and people are just expected to have a basic understanding of how things in the Warcraft universe fit together.Pretty quickly, though, the movie launches into a surprisingly compelling plot. Unlike many other movies in the genre (Lord of the Rings, for example) doesn't just focus on the human (or 'good') side, but explains the back story of the Orcs, and gives them personality and motivation. After a lackluster start, the movie manages to give the characters at least some depth, and despite having a pretty large cast, almost everybody has at least some character development.Technically, this movie is flawless. The amount of work that must have gone into creating the Warcraft universe in this movie must have been incredible. The attention to detail is breathtaking. In scenes where dozens and dozens of Orcs are shown, every single one looks unique, and has his (or her) own characteristics and movements. The world in which the movie takes place is beautiful, and the fight choreographs are amazing.The colorful world in which the movie takes place defies the grim-dark trend in recent years, where even Superman movies have to be sad and dark and rainy, and that alone makes Warcraft a refreshing joy to watch.Despite being quite long, the movie always moves ahead at a brisk pace, and manages to convey a ton of plot.In short, this is a really well made, very entertaining movie. It has its flaws, particularly in the beginning, but I truly enjoyed every second of it.",8,23,45,26 May 2016
