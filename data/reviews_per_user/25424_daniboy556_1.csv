The Avengers," NOT better than expected
","I had been waiting for this movie for a long time, but it wasn't what I expected. I was a little bit disappointed. The first hour was great, but then, the movie turned in a comedy movie, and it wasn't taken seriously like the BATMAN movies.Loki was supposed to be much more powerful, it was supposed that a Team was needed to capture him, but Hulk just took him like a ragdoll by himself. The aliens are supposed to be powerful, but they die just with 1 gunshot. I was waiting for the moment 'Loki vs. AVENGERS'. It never happened. The avengers just surrounded him and he surrendered.The movie has very good special effects, explosions, etc. but i expected something different. I LIKED THE MOVIE BUT IT COULD HAD BEEN MUCH BETTER",9,4,12,29 April 2012
