The Longest Yard," Mean Machine Redux!
","Okay, going in, I will admit freely that I am not the biggest Adam Sandler fan. I liked 'Big Daddy' and I thought 'Anger Management' was okay; you can have '50 First Dates'. But this movie was very not bad!But, the one thing I do like about Adam Sandler is the fact that the soundtracks in his films are top-rate. And this one is no exception. Every song used in this movie fit the story and the action to a T, and I really liked that the opening chase scene featured the same song (Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Mr. Saturday Night Special') as in the original.But enough about the music. Let's talk about the movie, while it's still fresh in my mind. In a nutshell, I enjoyed it. Some plot points were changed around from the original (like relocating the prison from Florida to Texas). But for the most part, 'The Longest Yard' basically follows the same exact story line of the 1974 original. I was especially surprised about the library scene, something I did not expect in today's PC society. In case you haven't seen this film (or the original) yet, then I will stop here about the story.James Cromwell slips into the shoes of Warden Hazen well, and seeing Burt Reynolds (star of the original) lend his support as Nate Scarborough was refreshing. Chris Rock, whose work I have enjoyed for years, was well-cast as Caretaker. As for Sandler, he took what was a dramatic story with funny moments into an all-out comedy with serious undertones. And, in a tip of the hat to Richard Kiel, this version of 'The Longest Yard' features not one, but two XXXL players: Pro wrestler Dalip Singh (all 400 pounds of him), and heavyweight martial arts fighter Bob Sapp (whom Chris Berman himself described as a 'refrigerator with legs'). Throw in some former NFL players (Brian Bosworth, Michael Irvin), more wrestlers (Bill Goldberg, Steve Austin), and a hip-hop star (Nelly), and you got yourself a team (or two). And, oh yeah... Adam Sandler's in it too (Just kidding! He does a good job here!).I liked some of the characterizations here. For example, Warden Hazen has a motivation for this football game of his (I won't say what it is, though -- That's what they call a 'spoiler'); in the original, the warden just seemed absently maniacal. At the same time, Scarborough was too shallow. No offense to Burt Reynolds, but I couldn't help thinking that some people would watch this film and ask 'Okay, so who's the old man on the team?'Technically, this version flowed a lot more smoothly than the original. I also like that the editing style employed in the game (as well as in a basketball scene and some of the practices) was an homage to the original. To me, it seems that Sandler wanted to honor the original, while making it his own film with its own legs at the same time. If that is so, then to me, he succeeded.If you like the original, don't be afraid to watch this. Believe me, it's worthy. If you haven't seen the original yet, then do so (After all, it's Reynolds in his prime). I won't review the original here, but I did post it.So, there it is. 'The Longest Yard' excels in some spots, falls a little short in others, but this remake is worth a look.",7,5,10,27 December 2006
United 93," Heightened Sense of Realism Gives an Extra Punch
","From the first frame of 'United 93', it became obvious to me that writer/director Paul Greengrass was very well aware of the sensitive subject matter of this movie. I remember vividly the events of September 11, 2001, as do many of us, and this movie delves into the motivation of the passengers of the ill-fated United Airlines Flight 93, and why it crashed into a Pennsylvania field instead of a Washington, DC, landmark, as the hitchhikers had intended to do.Every shot in this movie was hand-held, giving it a documentary feel. Every passenger captured on-camera at the terminal looked and acted so real, I thought I was in the terminal with them. Let me say, for the record, it is not easy for me to become that involved with a movie, but I did here.I also want to give kudos to Greengrass for adding even more to the realism of 'United 93' because of its cast. The crew of the airliner were real pilots and flight attendants (some of them employed by United Airlines). Many of the air traffic controllers were real, as were many of the military personnel featured in the movie. As an added bonus, some people actually played themselves. I'm not talking CNN anchors, either. Some of the people in this movie were reenacting their experiences on that fateful day, and I found them completely believable.'United 93' is not the kind of movie you would 'pop into the DVD player'. But I would recommend that everyone give it a viewing. It provides a unique perspective of that day without being preachy, trite, or contrived.",8,0,1,18 February 2007
Casablanca," Romance? Yes, But Men Will Like It, Too!
","'Here's looking at you, kid.''This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.''I don't stick my neck out for nobody.''Round up the usual suspects.''I'm shocked, SHOCKED, to find that gambling is going on in here!''Did you abscond with the church funds?''We'll always have Paris.'These are just some of the lines from this movie which have made their way into our lexicon. Of course, I did save the most famous one for last: 'Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.'Welcome to 'Casablanca', regarded as one of the most popular movies of all time. I know, I know, everybody says that, but it's true. When people criticize movies today, Casablanca is usually one of the 'go-to' films they turn to when they say 'They don't make 'em like they used to.'And, they would be correct.Ask any woman to name her top-five most romantic movies, and 'Casablanca' will likely show up on her list. And when it comes to movie romances, men's eyes usually glaze over at the mere mention of them. Well, I am here to tell you there is plenty to keep a man's attention in this film and, in the end, he may actually walk away in a non-catatonic state.First, you have Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, owner and proprietor of Rick's Caf√© Americain in the city of Casablanca. An expatriated American, Rick is a cynic whose establishment is just this side of illegal, yet he manages to stay in business and make a good living at it. And besides, it's Bogey!Then there's Claude Rains as the local chief of police, Louis Renault. Captain Renault is slippery as an eel, especially when it comes to dealing with those in authority above him. He's also inquisitive, intelligent, and hypocritical.Up next are the Nazis. Morocco was French territory in 1941, and the Germans occupied France during that time. Here, they are presented as ambitious warmongers bent on world domination (and that would be correct). With the Nazis around, there is an inbred conflict from the get-go, as Casablanca is portrayed as a hub for the French Resistance during World War II. I should also point out that this is the earliest American film I know of that not only uses the term 'concentration camp' by name, but it also suggests that people have died within them.Throw in a murder or two, and you have the makings of a good film-noir. Okay, so 'film-noir' officially sprang up after World War II, but it still feels like one. The camera angles, shot composition, lighting, use of shadow, a brooding leading man (Bogart), and a tormented femme fatale (Ingrid Bergman) all add up toward the formula.All of this is capped off with sardonic wit and tight drama, signs of a well-written script (which, interestingly enough, was cobbled together right up to the very end of filming). Also, the timing of this movie is what made it such a hit. It ranks right up there with 'On the Waterfront' (1954), 'The China Syndrome' (1979), 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' (1967), 'In the Heat of the Night' (1967), and 'The Deer Hunter' (1978) in terms of topicality within the society of the day.So, you men out there, when your woman suggests watching 'Casablanca', throw some popcorn in the microwave. Trust me, you'll be able to sit through this one!",8,4,7,18 November 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," A Film of Rare Breed
","The Motion Picture Academy honored the World War II era with Best Picture honors for films that explored unique perspectives of the war each year from 1942 through 1946 (with the exception of 1945). In 1942, it was 'Mrs. Miniver', about a family surviving on the home front. In 1943, 'Casablanca' dealt with the seedy underbelly of the black market, and how it was used to transport people persecuted by Nazi Germany to the United States. In 1944's 'Going My Way', it was more indirect; a young man seemingly goes half-cocked, marries a singer, then leaves for duty. And finally, we have 'The Best Years of Our Lives', a tribute to veterans and what became of their lives once their tours of duty were finished.Dana Andrews stars as Fred Derry, a captain in the U.S. Army Air Corps who is returning to his hometown of Boone City. On his way, he meets a sailor named Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) and an infantry sergeant named Al Stephenson (Fredric March). Each man has a different perspective of their home town, as well as unique experiences from the war, even though all three served in the Pacific Theatre. And all three men bear their own scars of the war.Though, like most films from Hollywood's so-called 'golden age', this movie does have a 'Hollywood ending', it isn't contrived here. The script by Robert Sherwood works well, and the performances by all the cast not only express the torment of men trying to fit back into their old lives, but also of their families and how they coped (or didn't cope) with them.This movie is among William Wyler's best, and it would be the second of three Best Picture winners that he helmed in his career ('Mrs. Miniver' and 'Ben-Hur' were the other two). It stands as a testament of among the best films Hollywood has to offer. As I have said already, the entire cast worked well together in this movie, one of the best examples of ensemble casting I have ever seen. But I give a special salute to Harold Russell, who plays the disabled sailor who just wants to be alone. Russell never considered himself a professional actor, and he had very few dramatic roles (mostly after 1980), yet the Academy deservedly bestowed him with not one, but two Oscar statuettes for his portrayal of Homer Parrish. I will not mince words here: Russell's performance is quite moving.'The Best Years of Our Lives' is a film of rare breed. I say this because not many films explored the lives of military personnel after their experiences in war. There have been a few more recent examples, like 'Coming Home' and, in a lesser sense, 'Courage Under Fire', but this was among the first. It is a moving example of film-making at its best.",9,3,3,31 December 2006
Gone with the Wind," A 4-Hour Chick Flick for Any Movie Fan
","'Gone With the Wind' is a film about which so much has been written, it made me think 'What could I say about this movie that hasn't been said before?' Well, in a year that gave us 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips', 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Wuthering Heights', 'Stagecoach', and 'Ninotchka', this is the movie that many say is the best film to come from the best year of film. All of the other movies I mentioned here (as well a couple more) were nominated for Best Picture of 1939, and I have seen each of them (except 'Ninotchka'). 'Goodbye, Mr. Chips' told a heartfelt tale of an educator and the lives he touched during his tenure at a boys' school. 'Wuthering Heights' was a sweeping romance with a memorable performance by Sir Laurence Olivier. 'Stagecoach' had action and thrills under the deft direction of John Ford, while becoming a star-maker for a man known as The Duke. And 'The Wizard of Oz' is quite possibly the most magical film of all time, immortalizing Judy Garland as the young Dorothy Gale and influencing nearly every fantasy film made ever since. And let us not forget some of the other memorable films released that year, like 'Gunga Din', 'Beau Geste', and 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'. So, what is it about 'Gone With the Wind' that makes it stand above the rest of the best? Was it because it was in color? No. 'The Wizard of Oz' was also in color (well, mostly). Was it Clark Gable's signature performance as Rhett Butler? Interestingly, despite the fact he was practically the only (and obvious) choice for the role, no. He didn't win Best Actor this time around (it was his third nomination in five years); that honor went to Mr. Chips himself, Robert Donat. What about Victor Fleming's direction? Well, he did take home the Oscar, but he was also one of three men to helm this movie. Was it the script, the sets, the cinematography? Again, all very well done. And, though this may not the first film to that comes to mind, 'Gone With the Wind' was a ground-breaker in visual effects, as it was one of the first movies to make extensive use of matte paintings for both interior and exterior sets, and to great effect. And let's not forget the 'Burning of Atlanta' sequence. As many people know, this was done on the old RKO Studios backlot by burning down old sets (Did you know that the final structure shown in this scene was the gate to Kong's lair in 'King Kong'?). With clever editing and visual mixing, the result is frighteningly effective.But enough about the big picture (so to speak). What is it about 'Gone With the Wind' that makes it stand out? To be sure, it was everything I have mentioned to this point, with one more ingredient thrown in to 'kick it up a notch'. Enter Vivien Leigh. After an exhaustive world-wide search for the right actress to play Scarlett O'Hara, she was the one who won the part. And she was the one took home the Oscar, too. As the conniving, bitchy, manipulative, money-hungry, d√©butante who wears her heart on her sleeve for the wrong man, Vivien Leigh delivers a performance unlike any ever seen before and few have delivered since. And, as Rhett Butler, Clark Gable gives us a rogue, a scalawag, and a mercenary, while also a gentleman, a romantic, and a doting father. I seriously doubt that any other man could have pulled it off (though Timothy Dalton did try years later on TV -- But that's another story). The end result is a mixture of some of the best on-screen chemistry ever concocted.The supporting cast does a wonderful job here, too. From Olivia de Havilland to Leslie Howard to the first Black Oscar winner, Hattie McDaniel, many of the performances of 'Gone With the Wind' are both memorable and well-cast, with one or two exceptions. For example, I thought Carroll Nye had the look and attitude of Frank Kennedy (Scarlett's second husband), but I didn't feel his performance was all that convincing. By the way, if you are a fan of the old 'Superman' TV series, look for George Reeves as one of the Tarleton twins (he's Stuart) at the beginning of the movie. Sure, it's a chick flick. Yes, it's four hours long. But if you call yourself a movie fan, even in passing, then 'Gone With the Wind' deserves a viewing!",9,2,3,19 June 2006
The Incredibles," Pixar Does It Again!
","Okay, I'll admit it. I'm in my 40s as of this writing, and I am still nuts about animation! When Pixar and Disney teamed up for 'Toy Story' in 1995, my mind was sufficiently boggled. Then came 'A Bug's Life', 'Toy Story 2' and 'Monsters, Inc.', and then other studios chimed in with their CG features, including 'Shrek' and 'Ice Age'.But this film is the one we're talking about, and 'The Incredibles' shines as yet another feather in the Pixar/Disney cap. The movie begins with an event which leads to lawsuits and government intervention, forcing all the superheroes of the world into hiding. It asks 'What if a family of supers had to lead normal lives?' and the answer seems clear: Dad hates his boring cubicle job, Daughter would much rather be invisible, Son lashes out too much, while Mom tries desperately to keep it all together.I won't get into the plot beyond this, but I will say there are references to some of sci-fi's best in this movie. I easily spotted gags representing 'Star Trek', 'Star Wars', 'The X-Men' and Disney's own 'The Black Hole'. I'm sure there are more; I guess repeat viewings are in store in order to catch them.The voice cast is top-rate (Disney almost never fails on this front), with Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jason Lee leading an excellent cast. Longtime Pixar fans will also notice Wallace Shawn as Bob Parr's overbearing boss, and John Ratzenberger maintains his tradition of contributing to every Pixar film to date.The animation quality is eye-popping, too. How Pixar seems to outdo themselves repeatedly is beyond me. I was particularly impressed with one shot involving a waterfall that parted so a vessel can pass through it.Though it isn't quite as magical (or as innocent) as the 'Toy Story' movies, 'The Incredibles' is still first-rate entertainment for the family.",8,1,2,6 January 2007
Patton," The Standard-Bearer of Biopics!
","When I was a boy, my father introduced me to this movie (among many others), and I was swept up in it from the get-go. To this day, 'Patton' remains at the top of my list of favorite movies of all time. So, I will apologize in advance if I begin to rave too much about this film.The opening monologue is a display of some of the finest acting ever put on film. As Patton, George C. Scott gives a fantastic performance from start to finish. The real General Patton wrote poetry, believed in reincarnation, was highly religious, and lived for the honor and glory of battle. At the same time, he was crass, vulgar, disruptive, and he severely frowned upon cowardice with conviction. George C. Scott captured all of these facets of Patton's life and delivered a look into a man who seemed in constant conflict, whether it was against the Germans, his superior officers, or himself.Told from the perspectives of both Patton himself and the German command that monitored him, 'Patton' also shows how the general seemed to single-handedly bring down the morale of Nazi Germany. This is especially evident following the 'slapping incident,' in which the Germans (incorrectly) focused on Patton while the Allies prepared for Operation Overlord (D-Day).The supporting cast is quite strong here, too. Karl Malden is a perfect choice as General Omar Bradley, an average soldier who happens to wear stars on his epaulets, and who serves as Patton's moral center. Michael Bates is a dead ringer as British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, right down to the mannerisms and the hooked nose. Fans of 'Star Trek' may recognize Michael Strong, who guest-starred in one episode of the original series, as General Hobart Carver, one of Patton's aides.On a side note, there is one glaring glitch in this movie: The tanks used were not Panzers and Shermans; they were American M48s. This is a Hollywood convention. But, considering that American tanks are named for well-known generals, and the M48 was called the Patton, I think we can let this slide.'Patton' is part war movie and part biopic, and it works well on both fronts. This is a must-have for any DVD collection.",9,1,3,17 May 2005
National Treasure," Enjoyable Family-Friendly Caper
","I heard big things about this movie from the get-go, and I must say that most of those things are right. When Jerry Brickheimer started producing films for Disney, I began to wonder why. But in the end, it looks like a good marriage. To date, the Bruckheimer/Disney team seems to fare pretty well, and 'National Treasure' is a testament to that union.Nicolas Cage stars as Benjamin Franklin Gates, with Jon Voight playing his father, Patrick Henry Gates. And Christopher Plummer makes a brief appearance as Ben's grandfather, John Adams Gates (do you see a pattern here?). Okay, enough about the Gates family. I thought it was an interesting way to present the Gates family and their ties to American history.The whole movie centers around the Declaration of Independence, on the back of which lays the final clue for the secret location of the legendary Treasure of the Knights Templar. Early in the film, Gates leads a party to a clue that points to the Declaration, and some of that party, lead by the 'questionably legal' Ian Howe (Sean Bean), split off. From this moment, the chase is on.Gates and his assistant, the eager Rigley Poole (Justin Bartha) try to warn authorities, but all of them, including archivist Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), laugh them off. At this point, any further plot points may be considered spoilers for those who haven't seen this movie yet, so I will stop here.For the most part, the performances were pretty good, though I did have a hard time believing Jon Voight as 30 years younger in the opening scene, which takes place in 1974. The wig and make-up he wore didn't help much, either (It's almost as bad as that awful get-up he wore as Howard Cosell in 'Ali').I did enjoy the action scenes for the most part. There were a couple of chase-scene clich√©s thrown in, but they still worked. And for those of you who wonder if your child can watch this movie, it's okay, trust me. The creepiness factor is at most moderate (a few brief glimpses of long-dead bodies), there is some gun-play (but only from the bad guys, and no one gets hurt), only one person dies (off-camera), and I can recall maybe one or two (very) mild profanities. Besides, it's a PG-rated Disney film.One thing I can say about this movie is that it is somewhat reminiscent of action films of the late-1940s and early-1950s. This is an enjoyable family-friendly movie, and it will entertain you and make you think (but not too much).",7,0,2,3 February 2007
All Quiet on the Western Front," Compelling, Daring, and Ahead of Its Time
","In a word, 'All Quiet On the Western Front' is a masterpiece! When watching this movie, it is sometimes hard to believe it was released in 1930.While there have been several 'anti-war' movies released over the years, this is among the first, and it is executed with tremendous effect. The scene that sticks most in my head takes place inside a bunker in the trenches. The shelling, the constant debris falling from the ceiling, the rats, and the men mentally breaking down are all amplified by the claustrophobic camera work.The battle sequences are terribly realistic, rivaling those shown in more contemporary films like 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998). The mortar explosions very strongly resemble the real thing, such as those shown in World War I archive footage. And the tracking shots of soldiers falling onto barbed wire will leave an indelible impression.I won't kid around here. This movie is arguably the most violent film of its time. Released before the creation of the infamous Hayes Code, 'All Quiet On the Western Front' graphically shows hand-to-hand combat, a soldier killed by a mortar shell (with only his dismembered hands remaining), and an agonizing death in the trenches over the course of hours (and the eyes stay open when the man dies). All of these events (and more) were shown from the perspective of a young German soldier named Paul B√§umer. Lew Ayres, who went on to gain fame as Dr. Kildare and then notoriety as a World War II conscientious objector, gives a strong performance as B√§umer.This is the second review I have written in which I mention the Hayes Code, and I have no doubt that this movie had at least some influence in its creation. Fortunately for us, Universal Studios felt the subject matter was compelling enough to allow the film to remain basically as-is. Seeing this film makes me wonder what movies would have been like had the Hayes Code not been enforced. Conversely, this particular movie would have been far different if it was produced with the Hayes Code in mind.'All Quiet On the Western Front' is a movie that is ahead of its time, and I think it is among the best movies ever produced and very deserving of its Best Picture win. If you notice it in a video store, or you see it listed on a classic movie channel some time, do yourself a favor: SEE THIS MOVIE!",10,3,4,3 November 2005
