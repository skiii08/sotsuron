Captain Phillips," Emotional Roller-coaster
","This movie is about decisions and actions of a civilian ship captain in hostile waters doing his duty as her understood his orders. Tom Hanks gives a very exceptional and emotional portrayal of Captain Phillips. Although you may know the details of the incident, seeing Hanks put words into actions was very emotional. Yes, you do see a great deal of this exceptional actor, but he is playing the title character of the movie so I would have been disappointed with anything less. The supporting actors worked very well in their roles as they looked the parts and the ship's crew expanded their parts as expected. I will let the politics of the Oscar committees play itself out, but I would recommend this film for many awards and for the viewing publics support.",9,2,5,18 October 2013
Knives Out," Knives Out or IN!!
",My wife describes it as the best 'Neo-Noir' movie. The mystery remains to the very in and just when you figure you have it; here comes another twist. It was fun throughout the entire movie. Acting was superb by all characters. It is a sleeper for us and we will be recommending it to all our friends.,9,2,5,15 February 2020
Hugo," Hugo is wonderful!
","This story was wonderful and I would have given it a 10 except it was a little long for my taste. It enriches the story if you have studied film history. If you have not, just sit back and prepare yourself for some beautiful scenery the story of a boy living in the Paris train station as he makes friends and finds his purpose in life. His name is Hugo and he struggles trying to exist in the train terminal by himself. If he is discovered he will be forced from the only life he has know into a orphanage and will probably never get to discover the secret of the gift left to him by his father. His search brings back memories of old film scenes. Many which have been lost in todays studies. This film is very enjoyable.",9,3,5,11 August 2013
