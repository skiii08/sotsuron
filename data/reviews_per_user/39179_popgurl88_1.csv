The Avengers," Fantastic movie
","The Avengers from last year is an amazing movie, with such a wonderful cast of actors from all over the place. Set in New York this exciting action packed movie is full of tense moments and wonderful scenes. The talent of the actors and everyone who helped create the movie made it such an awesome movie to watch. Heros unite to stop an alien invasion, caused by Loki in turn to get back at his brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth). If i was an actor, this would of been my first movie to audition for, as a lover of action movies.All in all, its a MUST WATCH, for all those action movie fans. An exciting new adventure in the Marval Universe. Packed full of action scenes and excitement, a fantastic movie to watch and will watch again.",9,2,6,30 September 2013
