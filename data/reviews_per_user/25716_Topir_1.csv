Requiem for a Dream," A real eye opener
","This movie took me completely by surprise. Yes, I knew it to be good and I knew it to be a 'heavy' film but I really had no idea. The first third of the film is actually quite laid back and lulls you into believing that this is just another film. Then the world crashes down on the characters. The last ten minutes of the film are really, really rough stuff, at least for me. I really can't put to words my feelings after the film; I was completely lost. Absolutely the best movie since 'Happiness'.",9,0,1,31 January 2002
