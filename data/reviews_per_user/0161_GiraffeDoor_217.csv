The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Not one for beginners.
","One day when I am way more experienced and perspicacious i will rewatch this and totally get all the oblique things it has to say on identity, destiny etc.But right now i just don't follow. The rich imagery, camera work, atmosphere and mystical score take it some of the way but it seems to be speaking a foreign language to me figuratively as well as literally.I liked the puppets. But I was upset that Veronika (the Polish one, Polishness is sexy) is barely in it.I remember when the screen went black and I thought 'if the credits start rolling now, I will be so ticked' And then they did.I suppose if Blue was an anti-tragedy and White was an anti-comedy and Red and an anti-romance, this is an anti-allegory?Yeah, that works for me...",4,1,2,26 May 2019
"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Not bad.
","This is a fun movie that's worth your time, sort of like Rocky but more of a comedy, in that it's more about someone proving that they can stick to something.The symbolism isn't exactly subtle and it's very trope heavy (the seemingly perfect love rival, the lovable loser etc.).But it's sweet, it has an agreeably dumb sense of humour and although it's rather sachrarine, you;ll want to root for this movie in the end.They do manage to make some pretty high stakes so it's more than just a marathon.",7,0,0,23 March 2019
The Blair Witch Project," It doesn't just coast on its gimmick and is worth a try.
","I was born too late to get swept away with the hype and the particular way this movie was marketed. Before seeing this movie I was sure it would be terrible. I'm not against found-footage on principle, but everything I read made this movie sound like it would be trash, especially the positive reviews.I thought that it would just coast on its gimmick and marketing and do nothing but shake the camera and scream. Saying directly to the camera 'I'm so scared!' isn't exactly following 'show don't tell'.Maybe it's because of this that I was pleasantly surprised. I usually hate improvised stuff, it's insulting to the audience. But here they pull it off just right. The dialogue sounds spontaneous and believable but they edit so that it never gets dull.The pacing is impeccable too. We move smoothly from the amateur documentary to frustrating situation to a bit of a nightmare. And irritating comments like 'this is creepy' notwithstanding, as a slow burn, it is really effective.We don't get any of the other things that annoy me in horror. It never gets soapy, there are no cheap scares, there is no filler.I basically knew how the whole thing ends, not the exact end, just the gist of it, and I was still clutching Teddy when things really kick off.This is a polarizing movie for understandable reasons. I really get that. But this happened to really get the formula right for me.it might help having low expectation like me but I would say it's still one of the few really good found footages. Better than Paranormal Activity 2, not as good as Creep 1 or 2.",8,0,2,24 February 2019
The King's Speech," It's all in the handling.
","An impressive picture, given that its based around almost no stakes at all. I mean, I'm not saying a speech impediment isn't a real challenge to live with for a couple of reasons but really, he's royalty, i'm not going to feel that sorry.It is Firth's immensely sympathetic performance of a repressed and slightly neurotic individual that gives this the kick it needs, forming a superb double act with the failed actor finding a purpose in helping another who needs the help only he can give (apparently).Pretty sweet and often fairly funny, it's Bonham Carter doesn't have too big a part thank goodness (I'm getting pretty sick of her), and also a bit marred by its desperation to make out Edward VIII as a villian whose desire to marry for love was some kind of betrayal.The depiction of the royals as humans is what makes this truly a treat. The toxic Michael Gambom as George V juxtaposed to the wonderful tenderness that Bertie has with his Family.But I am going to say this: he didn't have to become King. He chose that. And it's not like he saw any fighting so it's not like he lost much.",7,0,0,30 November 2019
Angels & Demons," I guess this is the quality of movies in purgatory.
","Loud, needlessly complicated and confusing tale that never really gives a sense of significance.But seen in fragments it's well produced fun with an amazing sense of location and Hanks always brings it.I could not tell you what it was about and I've freakin' seen it.",6,1,1,31 January 2020
Vertigo," The plot takes you up high, the skill was on the ground floor
",This rather plodding thriller suffers from the horrific miscasting of James Stewart. His quacking voice is way to warm and comical for this role though he does his best.An inauspicious amount of talk about 'possession' leads to the core of this story: demanding you to just believe that the male and female lead totally fall for each other. If either had a real personality between them it might have been interesting.There's actually a bit of intrigue but a shameless scene of self spoilering just emasculated the whole picture.The rest is a predictable and laboured story of unexplicable obsession.Vertigo actually has very little to do with it; it's like a metaphor or something.An embarrassingly fake dream sequence and attempts at comic asides only increase that.,3,4,14,7 April 2019
Men in Black 3," I usually like sequels but this took it too far.
",This movie annoyed me. It had none of the charm of the first nor any of its darkness or brutality or wit.You get very little Tommy Lee Jones which is a cheat and an excruciatingly derivative and mawkish time travel narrative that feels for like it's from the cartoon (which was on average much better than this).What is even with the time travel mechanics of this movie? A life for a life? Is this MiB or Merlin? And I hate that guy in the hat. Just be quiet!!Tim Curry does what he can in viciously malevolent alien but his make looks fake and we only get a small glimpse of the non-human side very close to the end.And past K is annoying . Vapid little redneck.,3,1,4,30 April 2019
Walk the Line," Not a pedestrian effort
","Gaining a lot, I'm sure from being familiar with its subject, as someone who never knew of Johnny Cash until watching this (cut me some slack, I was 12), this was still a vivid and well characterised story of all the highs and lows of stardom.Efficiently paced considering we cover like, 30 years, the movie end where it needs to end and becomes a creative romance along the way that steers clear of any sentimentality.In short, excellent for what it is but you got to have a real appreciation for it's trying to do. It's such a 'grown ups movie'.",6,0,0,19 August 2019
Gremlins," Watch at any hour if you can't find something better.
","Festive demi-semi-horror for all the family (if you are happy with your kid sleeping with you until menarche but, hey, I don't judge).I feel a bit blue that this really could have been a classic of genuine horror if handled a but differently but if judged by its own standard is perfectly fine.Like a lot of '80s movies of this type (more so than earlier decades for some reason), it can feel very dated with a lot of slow pacing, filler and story elements that don't go anywhere (like the girl who doesn't like Christmas. She has a good reason but it has nothing to do with anything).The best thing about this movie is its practical effects making it a delightful exercise in cinematic cuteness (and grotesquerie) that one can well imagine being just what those '80s audiences in the winter were in the mood for.Not a bad christmas or halloween movie but there is better stuff. It could so be your kids first taster of horror if they're kind of sensitive.",7,0,1,17 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The first really good star wars movie
","I remember being 6 years old when my parents took me to see this. I'd never heard of Star Wars.I walked out thinking this the greatest thing I'd ever seen. I got the VHS and watched it over and over.Basically everything you want from a space opera: actiony, funny, visually compelling, poignant, epic, full of fascinating technologies like the light sabre and how those droids fold up.The characters are better fleshed out than in the original trilogy, the pacing is faster, the plot is richer and the political background is far better thought through.I love Jar Jar. He needs to be there even though I would remove a lot of his material.The story of a young genius from humble origins leaving home to train to be a space-knight-wizard has a universal appeal. The design of the movie, both for its science fiction aspect and it's diverse cultural evocations, is enchanting.A movie to watch again and again.",8,4,10,12 August 2019
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," An even better love story than Twilight.
","I feel slightly foolish reviewing this since I sort of figure that if you sat through the first three movies then you're going to check this out sooner or later and if you haven't seen them, well ... 'saga' is right there in the title.But I was pleasantly surprised by this. I'm not a twi-hard but I think it's fair to say a lot of the more vocal hate hurled against this movie has an ulterior motive.Throughout the series, there has always been that biblical undertone; that question of whether it's better to pursue transhuman power or maintain our humanity and it all finally comes to the boil in a pretty intense narrative of tribal conflict, belonging and challenging predicaments.For the first time I think I can really feel what the fans feel about this story. The Saga can be a bit alienating to people who don't fetishize the central romance but with the groundwork thoroughly applied, Meyer's hard work pays off at least on screen. For me, the aesthetic value of a romance is limited by the development of the participants and as much as I like Bella Swan (I'd date her before Hermione, *shrug*) she and her Beau (see what I did there?!) have never really struck me as having much definition as characters except in terms of their relationship with each other (which was always a bit insta-lovey). But here the substance of the story shines through and it truly feels the part of that series you always wished you could have read as a kid.The nuances of this 'miracle' child, the character that always calls it a 'fetus' in contrast to the one that insists it's a 'baby' should be apparent to everyone. It leads us to an edgy situation of the conflict of supporting your loved one and avoiding the actions that may take them away from you. I was compelled.Meanwhile, simmering tensions between bestiality and necrophilia, uh I mean...the werewolves and the vampires are pretty epic. In addition to a poignant rendition of someone's familial loyalty tested by doing what one feels is right we get to see that Jacob is way more than eye candy.I think it reflects positively on the series that we open with a wedding on what is to all practical purposes the 'Final Chapter'. Harry Potter also did this curiously albeit to fairly peripheral characters. Popular culture has trained me to see a wedding of this kind as the natural conclusion to any epic series but here, the real challenges (as they often do in real life) begin after the vows have been exchanged.So much of the first act is the marriage and honeymoon. It's strange how sitcomy the whole thing feels at times (or maybe whatever Hollyoaks is would be a better analogy), seriously, the 'let's do anything but bang' montage was something I was totally not prepared for, complete with the chess-board of platonicalness.But my girl Kristen looks fabuloso. She is radiant when she needs to be and vulnerable when she needs to. If your memory of Stewart is the first movie, well she has honed her craft and she is pretty breathtaking in this. And girl gets LAID!!! Too bad the playa hating censors had to neuter this picture but the director really makes the best of it. Seriously, the trivia says it was her thrusting that the issue. Never say a girl doesn't commit...The rest is the eye popping blockbuster you'd expect. The production design, the convincing giant wolves, the stunning fights, all wrapped together in the Pacific Northwest Gothic aesthetic that Twilight has really made its own. The use of color and setting is actually quite majestic. The music is always on point, Carter Burtwell's Orestral (Danny who?) as well as the popular songs applied make every moment count, not just the wedding.If there's one negative thing that remains in the mind, it's the CGI infant. But it's not as bad as everyone says it is.People think of this series as trite young adult fiction because that's pretty much what it is. But that's not a bad thing, and this entry to the series really shows a saga that began as chocolate box romance blossom into something that's actually pretty impressive. The series has grown-up with its fan-base (well the movies have, I've only read the first one and its gender-flip) and managed that for more effectively than I felt Harry Potter did (no offense intended to the Potter heads reading, I can admit that I'm a low-key fan myself of specific parts). Cards on the table: I can barely remember what the third movie was even about. Is it about anything? There's a love triangle and the vampire council is mad at them for some reason and there's Dakota Fanning well past her prime..., really I DID see it...But if for whatever reason you have not seen the other sequels and are reading reviews of this movie (we would get along), then I am inclined to say that you could do a lot worse than this. I never felt bored for a second of its 2 hour run time.My Fascination with this series not withstanding, I am Tempted to say that you shouldn't Hesitate to enjoy the Revelations of this movie.",8,1,1,26 April 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," Do more horror, Mr. Goodman.
","I think this movie deserves to be judged on its own merits rather than what one thinks a Cloverfield sequel ought to look like.John Goodman is formidable as doomer having his time to shine and who is king of his castle. One doesn't know what to believe as we carefully consider our options along with the heroin.Tense, well paced and not without a sense of humour that doesn't detract from this tension, I would say this is superior to the first movie. So many little things in it work: 'I want us to be one big happy family'....chills...A lot of people condemned the 'ending' meaning the climax. I liked the climax but I won't ruin it.The real ending (final 30 seconds) annoyed me but I've been more ticked off.",7,0,0,23 September 2019
Skyfall," Let's just pretend this is the last ever Craig Bond, shall we?
",I thought this made the perfect Swansong to the Craig era.We finally get to really get a closer look at the cracks of this damaged individual especially as he is examined psychiatrically and the narrative is more than just a day at the office but a genuine emotional journey that really makes you feel you've arrived somewhere after a long quest.It has a quite pathos you don't expect in a Bond movie but it feels on-brand and a long time coming with Craig and Dench both getting an ample amount of screen time and really bringing it.,7,0,3,11 March 2020
50 First Dates," There are much smarter and much better made dumb comedies for you to enjoy
","I can like a lot of stupid humor but this is definitely one of the more annoying.Adam Sandler has proved he can be in a somewhat watchable movie (like Click or Grown Ups) but this is excruciating.The humor is the standard lazy, very biological approach to humor where the bodily function IS the joke. It's embarassing to see Sandler try and woo this woman. And uncomforable. I'm not saying it's totally wrong to date someone with that conditon nor that we shouldn't be allowed to make jokes about anything but there just isn't a lot of lucidity about what the movie is doing.And they try to make the dumb humor palatable by pouring on the saccharine..",3,2,7,9 April 2019
The Hangover," I didn't regret this the morning after.
","Thoroughly agreeable, whirlwind, comedic adventure that isn't afraid to get crass but is dignified with it.It really kicks off with a mystery and then develops into a building crescendo of increasingly high stakes that is all OK in the end.Great characters.",8,0,0,4 August 2019
The Ring," Has not aged well.
","As neat as the premise sounds, Scary Movie 3 handles the imagery at hand better.A very slow, bland detective story takes a supernatural turn and wastes its potential with heavy handed, visioning and a plot that makes little sense and gives little credit to the audience.",4,0,5,11 March 2019
It," It came from beneath my expectations
","I've always been a bit sour grapes about King since he seems to be everywhere: every award list, every internet top 10, every bookshelf of people who say they like this genre...It's tempting to make some joke about this being a remake of the Clara Bow vehicle but I can't think of a good one. I hate it when people don't research what titles have already been used. I guess this movie is actually 'It: Chapter 1' according to its credits.I tried to go into this with an open mind. I haven't the book but I want to give whoever is responsible props for adapting it, not only in two parts, but for dedicating each part to a particular time period. I find that 90% of the time when a story keeps switching between two time periods it would have been so much better if it had just stayed in the past. I found this to be the case with Tom Stoppard's 'Arcadia', the recent 'Hill House' Adaptation and a little known book called 'Blood Sinister'. One really good example however is Isao Takahata's wonderful mangamation 'Only Yesterday'.But now to review the actual movie. This is one of those pictures that always seems to be teetering on the edge of being a classic of its kind. There's a ton of evident professionalism in how it's realized, in the camera work, the special effects, the locations etc. Story-wise too, I can really feel what this could have been: an epic story of friendship and facing your fears against a formidable villain.To try and pinpoint the negatives to one thing, I suppose it's all about judging the tone. From the first scene I said to myself that I would not watch it as a horror movie anymore, I'd just watch it as an adventure like Gremlins or Jumanji, where it's all about the seen, not the unseen since they really blow their load very quickly with that paper boat and drain scene. And I was fine with this.With this movie they so could have been a chilling film with strange imagery and building tension or else have gone the other way and just been a goofy, zainy movie like an R rated Roger Rabbit (which was actually pretty terrifying in a PG remember). But what we get is an unhappy medium of a movie that can't quite seem to make its mind up on what kind of feel it wants. Contrastive moods and tones in different scenes, including a well judged use of mood whiplash can be effective but for whatever reason, the terror elements and the more in-your-face elements basically cancel each other out so you can't really enjoy either, not even as a horror comedy.One reason is Pennywise himself. He looks terrible. In the bad way. I used to be really freaked out by clowns but he is such a Scooby-Doo-esque vision of the creepy clown he feels like he belongs in a comedy parodying the scary clown trope. If he had looked like a sincere attempt at a clown that you might really find in at a preschooler's party then he would have looked more terrifying. There's something especially chilling about something about something which clearly isn't trying to scare you but which you clearly should be scared of. Tall order to create I know... At least he's very well acted and has tons of charisma.The human element is frequently charming, cute and engaging. Every character feels well thought out and the whole is just one long nostalgia trip about one strange but beautiful summer of self-discovery, due in no short part to Molly Ringwald Junior (I totally called her out on that before the character did). I hear in the book she gets a bit more jiggy with it. There is no cowardice worse than keeping cool stuff in the book out of the movie.When we see these characters integrated into the actual plot, that's when the stuffing starts to show. These horror movies that are themselves about fear are always taking a big risk. They can indeed be powerful stories that help us look into ourselves or just lazy, portentous claptrap. Perhaps a lot of meaning and nuance got lost in adaptation; I've listened to the first chapter of the book and boy does ol' Stevie lay it on thick with the narration. Sample: 'it was something your Mom said to you, not your brother' SHOW DON'T TELL!You can feel the picture sagging beneath the weight of it's own ambition. Elements like slaughtering the cattle, the fire, the licentious father and the stammering don't really seem to go anywhere and ultimately the whole narrative seems to abandon all the philosophical threads it seems to want to establish and the last act is all about the strictly material struggle against not-Tim Curry.On another note, am I dumb or was anyone else confused about the rules here? Is Pennywise Tangible? Is he vulnerable to physical attacks? He seems to morph and teleport and conjure up visions as freely as Uncle Grampa. He feels super powerful and then suddenly very mortal. It made it very hard to keep emotionally involved with the action.And also that stammering kid was such a sanctimonious..the kid with the glasses was my favourite.But there are a lot of kooky images and nifty sequences if you just make no effort at all to follow what the context is.I feel like we missed out on a real classic of it's kind; a unique hybrid of horror, a philosophical novel and bildungsroman all because of a complacent approach to the writing.",5,0,0,16 March 2020
Hereditary," Sterile.
","As wonder woman once told me: 'if you ever see anything you can't quite explain, a cult did it'.I can admit when I first reviewed this I was a bit over emotional but now that I have had some time to compose myself I want to that I can believe this movie really did come from a good place creatively. They tried to not be just another conveyor belt horror. It was a story, not only of material conflict and external menaces but also of interpersonal problems, to really show there is a lot to be feared in people's humanness as well as the apparently inhuman.But Although it looks the part of a classy, original piece of dark fiction it fails on a few levels, I think because it is in denial about the type of movie it should be. If it had focused on being a dark paranormal family drama I think it would have so much more to give, but wrangling it into the horror genre just warped it into something it's not. As much as I would love to see an effective, character driven horror, this was never meant to be it. One feels that a ton of moments were just shoved in just for the creep factor and it just makes the tone risible rather than creepy.You will understand the conclusion of this movie, it's not esoteric. This movie is that unhappy medium between being way too slow and way too convoluted; far too upfront and far too confusing. By the end I am painfully aware of the situation but still scratching my head on small details and not in the fun way. A good horror is mysterious sure, but mysterious is the skilful presentation of information that makes me believe there is an answer waiting to be found, to be confusing you only need to bombard me with weirdness for the sake of weirdness which when you think about it is not really being weird at all.I think it wants to be Donnie Darko or something but it didn't actually have a story to tell. Or if it did, I understood it, but I didn't feel it if that makes sense. The dots just don't connect, it doesn't feel like its many creep out moments were developed from a core idea but the other way around. It's like a blank template to just ornament with as many spooky little flourishes as the writer could brain storm.Story-wise it doesn't seem to know what to do with itself. It doesn't really seem to move except in infrequent jumps. The story doesn't develop outside of key moments, it just sort of ruminates. I like a slow burn, but this didn't even crackle, it just throws a bunch of gasoline on itself once in a while. It has its moments sure but what do I do with the flaccid quarters of an hour?It is very heavy handed. Most obviously in the music. The handling of music is HORRIBLE! I cannot stress how incompetent the music direction on this is. It's as bad as 'Get out' and 'The Hole in the Ground' combined. The music itself is fine, put that on a CD and it can be fun to listen to as Dark Ambient, but it just kills any atmosphere this movie might have had.And that's before we get to the soapy dialogue: this so does not earn the screaming matches it thinks are emotional nor does it justify deeply unsympathetic mother character who is overacted at nearly every turn. Toni Collette shows the subtlety and restraint of Pennywise in being the most excruciatingly pugnacious and hysterical as she can be. But I suppose even a good actor can only do so much with this kind of script that thinks Eastenders is the height of drama. I would so check out another movie she's in just to see if it really is just the script.For all the ways it tries to be a nuanced and complex piece of storytelling there is just something so annoying, so risible, so *arrogant* in its pretence of being an 'arty', new age kind of horror when it is really just another generic horror that took a few more of all the wrong risks ultimately showing its colors as more style than substance.Here's a few things they threw in just because:<ul><li>They begin with text on black screen. Never a good sign.</li><li>The camera rotates 90 degrees on two characters. It is very artificial.</li><li>A character sees something in a reflection that isn't an accurate reflection of the thing.</li><li>Upside-down tracking shot.</li><li>Dream fake out.</li></ul>It handles its uncanniness poorly. It doesn't establish the parameters that allow for this early on. It doesn't allow us to consider any ambiguity on whether they supernatural or just mental illness.I know a lot of people will say 'I guess some people would like a gorefest with no subtlety'. I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad for liking this movie, no one wants to see a well made, subtle, horror/dark movie more than me. I'm not saying I have refined tastes, it just sounds fun. But one has to remember that being confusing is not the same thing as being meaningful, being convoluted is not the same thing as being nuanced and putting style over substance does not immediately elevate you above all the other cookie cutter examples of your genre.I once thought that anything that tried to be unique had to be worth seeing. I'm not saying you shouldn't see this, even if just so you can talk about with your friends because is indeed unique. I will say in its defence that with SO MANY conveyor belt horrors out there that really do not deserve to be bared with past the first 10 minutes, at least this is audacious and singular enough to be watchable for its 2 hour runtime. I do not force myself through movies, if I don't feel gripped I give up and I saw this in one sitting.",4,2,5,25 January 2020
Meet the Parents," At least he didn't have to meet the writers of this movie
",I don't want to be too hard on this movie since I got it as a birthday present.Simply put: it's one of those comedies whose entire philosophy on comedy is just have everything go wrong when it must go right in the most embarrassing way possible for all involved.It's amazingly well conceived an executed in every scene but without the right sense of humour this will be painful.,4,1,5,23 June 2019
Mulan," It da Man. Sort of.
","When I was like 6 years old I think I bought the VHS with birthday money and I watched it over and over.This is a movie I don't think I'll ever stop rewatching. As good as it is that feminism is getting more and more popular, we unfortunately have too many writers who think they can score brownie points by waving the black and purple flag without anything to say about a struggles of women. Ocean's 8, Brave and that god awful Dracula Adaptation in 2019 just pandered to the audience by telling them what they wanted to hear at the expense of well developed characters and good story telling.Mulan is therefor perhaps even more relevant now than ever as what a good empowered female movie should actually look like, and this is over a decade before #metoo.A lot of this is to do with Mulan herself. She is a good character because she is neither a helpless damsel in distress like Snow White nor the opposite problem of a character that has no personality beyond being practically perfect in every except in having no real personality, like Hermione Granger.She is clearly smart and resourceful from her dog powered chicken feeding device (It's a lot more simple than I make it sound) but when she enlists in the army she is as much out of her depth as anyone but she has the capacity to rise to the challenge in a believable way and they don't spend too much time on it. Mulan is the perfect fusion of relatable underdog and credible hero. While in a lot of comparable movies, the human protagonist is almost one of the blandest with the anthropomorphic help carrying the show, but she has perhaps the most personality of any pre-Tangled 'Princess'.We have not only an internal conflict of a person not knowing where they belong but also a material one in Mulan trying to spare her father military service and the too strands coalesce so elegantly in this story of overcoming the self, of friendships emerging between initially hostile parties and of also of the futility of war in a mature and subtle way ('A girl worth fighting--' cue reality check). One really gets a vivid sensation of the destruction of armed conflict in a way one typically doesn't see in the 'family' movie.It ticks all the other boxes you expect it too and more: the music, not just the songs but the intense score, the immersive sense of local color juxtaposed to the austerity of battle, the comedy, the pathos, the impeccable structuring of the story and intense images (Mulan must have worn the most easily removied make-up ever but I don't care), that all come together in a feature that is more of a treat each time.My only real qualm is an unsavoury spitting attempt but that's a small thing.This is what a feminist family movie looks like.",10,0,0,18 March 2020
Se7en," It may not be the Snow White Reboot I wanted but I wasn't disappointed.
","This movie lives up to the hype. With a great concept and a unique tone, the oppressive ethos of the inner city is our backdrop for two rich but contrastive characters on the hunt for a particularly creative species of evil, one that is itself on a crusade against human vice.Detailed, clever and restrained, the sensation of growing dread never quite goes away.",8,1,1,14 January 2020
Akira," It's...an experience
","I don't know where to begin with this. This is a wild ride.I struggle to make sense of it. Does it even make sense? I don't know!What starts as generally semi-dystopian motorcycle gang yarn turns into a stunning piece of large scale body horror that seems to have something to say and a very loud (if poorly articulated) way of saying it.It's spectacular.It can drag in places and none of there are no really well developed characters but I liked the zeitgeist of motor gangs and how it felt at once futuristic yet retro with their gals, the masculine teasing and the disregard for law enforcement and refinement yet a respect for the fine craft of motorcycle maintenance.No masterpiece but something that needs to be seen. By the non-squeamish...",7,2,4,17 March 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," I thought this movie was about someone who was rogue...
","Familiar science fantasy fun only now with an added dark twist since it's main characters aren't the ones we're used to.I don't really understand how it ties in and I don't care. It's well paced, explosive and balances seriousness with a great sense of humour.You can sort of watch it as casually or as seriously as you choose to.Robot character is so good.",7,0,3,17 January 2020
Coraline," We're off to button eyes...let's hear children's cries...Button eyes....Button Eyes....
","I really believe that the basic story of Coraline has the capacity to be an absolutely terrifying parable but neither the original novella nor this movie really tap into that. I'm not trying to sound like some tough guy, I still can't quite watch Dumbo alone. (There's no accounting for terror).But nevertheless there's lots to like into more professional rendition of a modern folk tale that eventually becomes are blockbuster style story. Ornately gothic and stylish as we move from the humdrum world of a neglected girl into a world of make believe realized. Festive and funny and then deliciously sinister in that fairytale way.More worthy of the legacy of Tim Burton's movies than any actual Burton movie since Corpse Bride, the humour, imagination, chills and thrills make this something I should imagine the parents will enjoy AT LEAST as much as the younger people.Coraline herself makes for a charming heroine, though she may be taciturn, it's for understandable reasons and it is very satisfying to see her journey of self discovery in this case of be-careful-what-you-wish-for but which, subtly, is ultimately a story of a little girl that just wanted some parental attention.Always atmospheric and pacy, expect none of the sanctimoniousness or portentousness of the book.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
Passengers," If it had sucked I could have said something like 'want to go to sleep for 90 years? Just watch this movie!' But it's actually pretty passable. So...yeah.
","The problem with high-concept stories is that they have a tendency to coast on their concept. But the thing about a great concept is that you can coast on them for quite a while and this movie has a good concept.Plotwise at least, this sort of writes itself; Act 1: the solitude, Act 2: the courtship, Act 3: well, I think I'll let you find out.I knew the basic premise going in but I still feel they missed a trick really establishing the main problem. our guy doesn't have that much in terms of personality but I liked him and enjoyed following on this emotional journey into the bowels of loneliness with only the automatons for company (and trust me, they're bad company).The design and sets will satisfy your technophilic cravings. The ship has a distinctive design I thought was pretty original and the chic, futuristic (but not cartoonishly futurist) insides made a wonderful backdrop as one man's gilded cage (I like that term, I'm not sure where I first read it...). At times it reminded me of a videogame in how you just wonder round and discover this three dimensional labyrinth where it neatly recycles some ideas that were wasted on Space Oddyssey.Watching this movie you just have to accept that there was no failsafe to early awakening because 'the pods don't malfunction'. When you think how much Health and Safety effects our lives right now, it's hard for me to accept that that would stop them hedging their bets. I can suspend disbelief for everything else no problem but this annoys me.So finally our deuteragonist becomes part of this. When I was reviewing 'Mother!' I said that every role that went to Lawrence should have gone to Kristen Stewart (yeah, I know, bring on the dislikes), but this character was actually quite perfect for her, which is a discredit to the character. Rarely in fiction does one encounter someone as smug, self-satisfied and hoity-toity as this mademoiselle. I get the impression that I am just supposed to buy that she's the perfect that is out of any mechanic's league, but it's an informed attribute. Like how apparently they are an unlikely pair though personally I think he would dump her before she dumped him. We was a cool, sexy guy and a lot less self absorbed. When he asks her out she actually says 'I thought you'd never ask'. You coulda asked him out, you can either be a *girl* or help smash patriarchy, not both.The story actually has a lot of punch as it shows not only an initially desperate situation but also the extent this compels us to do something embarrassing to the one we really want to like us and the aftermath. So yeah, he's in the doghouse for a bit.That's another thing that bugged me: I wouldn't have thought about this a few years ago but it seems to always be the male character that the pursuer, the one that pines for the female and is the one that has to live with the idea that they messed up in their pursuit of the female. Why can't it be a male character that gets pursued this way, or a female character that is shown to pine and pursue a male? It could be homosexual or just inverted straightness, but it would be so easy to do...so that's my rant.Our final act is pretty intense and the suspense is really there. It's a pity that it's wasted hear since I was never sufficiently invested in this romance for it to have much of an emotional impact and the timing is frequently off. Suspense is like a joke, each part can't be too slow or too quick, it's a delicate operation but it looks stunning with a lot of inventive moments convincingly realized.Ultimately, passengers is a sweet piece of high budget science fiction with a perfectly workable plot that is fine for a Monday night, only really marred by a bland (but likeable enough) character and one really annoying character. The script isn't exactly tight either; a lot of the cutsiness just falls flat. But there's a good chuckle or two in the mix.",6,0,0,15 March 2020
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," If I managed it I don't see why you can't, Jason.
","Another pointless pseudo-comedy that is way more obsessed with its protagonists's angst than having any jokes.Eccentric characters, embarrassing circumstances and habitual bickering are 90% of the humour as the movie begs you to care about several deeply unsympathetic characters.Really makes one think that if this is comedy I could do it. The best adjective for it is 'watchable'.",5,2,5,28 July 2019
The Hunger Games," Adequate young adult adaptation that won't leave you hungry.
","Watchable dystonia yarn without much interesting to say and a heroine that's hard to like (I suspect a lot of nuance was lost in adaptation). I don't mind protagonists with little to smile about (I adore Daria) but Catniss is not just cold, she lacks any warmth deep down. Lawrence plays her with the same a bland aloofness that is hard to relate to.Often fun to look at and with a good sense of humour, it's disappointing that they spend so much time in this wood. IS that really the best arena you can come up with?",6,1,2,19 August 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Audacious enough but I think it's already dated.
","This movie didn't resonate with me.As charming as Pegg and Frost with their magnificent chemistry, this does not equal comedy and I feel a bit embarassed watching them.The zombie aspect (when it finally comes) is pretty brutal. All the more so for its comic timing and quite welcome since until that point it is a pretty generic piece of relationship drama where Pegg just keeps getting it wrong.But I there really aren't any jokes. I like dark humour, but that's more than dark stuff with a pop music soundtrack. It's not really dark comedy, it's more like 'here's something macabre presented flippantly. You can laugh now.' Family Guy knows how to make things you shouldn't joke about seem like the funniest thing ever. It's because they make it into a joke rather than trusting transgressive themes ARE the joke. The movie seems somewhat lazy in that regard.The romantic interest is also pretty bland.The movie does not skimp on the gore though. Make and direction really came through on that.A lot of people love this but I think a lot of it is just because it was fresh for its time.",4,0,2,17 March 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Far from a treasure but it's not quite dead.
","From the very first sequel, the pirates franchise lost its freshness and became formulaic crowd pleaser.It's all there: rich set pieces, actioneer humour, fun character exchanges, some CGI creepiness and generally badassdom but it doesn't take the story or characters anywhere it needed (or even wanted) to go.It's just another blockbuster, which isn't a bad thing at all if you want that but the thing I remember most from going to see this as a kid was some pretty numb buttocks.",6,0,0,19 August 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," It's hard to not like this.
","It's hard to imagine a better movie for watching when all the family is round.This swell throwback to the swashbuckling genre manages to hit all the right notes and still be so au courant.They realize this sense of a different time and place with such expertize and vividness, you believe you're in a new world of vintage adventure and peril. It makes the rather daring move to add a supernatural antagonist but the judgement is just right.The use of good humour from all characters but especially the inimitable Captain Jack is a rare treat in adventure comedy where everyone's chemistry with everyone else is impeccable.Thrilling, captivating, funny and also pretty terrifying in fits in starts this will make you fall back in love with blockbusters.The sequels kind of wrung out the charm but the first one is a masterpiece of easy to watch, satisfying adventure.",8,0,0,13 June 2019
12 Angry Men," It shouldn't be as engaging as it is. But it is.
","A movie that is basically one long conversation which would normally be a bad idea but it's a conversation that is had every day and the outcome determines the life or death of a person.I was cynical about this picture. Often people swoon over a movie just because it's conscientious and has a good message at the expense of actually having an engaging or intelligent plot.Well I would say we do have a plot in a very meaningful way. While we have so many dramas on TV about cops catching lawbreakers, this movie tries to depict something unlikely, a person doing something the digital age knows more than any is a hard thing to do: change someone's mind.There really isn't a dull moment. All the factors and the variables from the actual logistics of the crime itself to fiercely well thought through and convincing examination of our numerous kind of biases (from racism to something actually even more haunting) all come together in what is nothing short of a feat of writing. I've never seen anything like it. It loses no power for its age, it only gains it in face.Every character is rich, three dimensional and plays with amazing competence. The performances keeps it visually interesting but they somehow managed to give a cinematic feel with their cramped location without going overboard.I'd recommend it even to people who don't like movies made before 1964.",8,0,0,25 October 2019
Hostel," Please give it a chance.
","I remember seeing promos for this. I forgot them as soon as I saw them.Then I saw it was playing on television and I literally watched to see some nudity because I knew that much about the movie.So committed to watching for 10 minutes. Then I watched another 10. And another.I couldn't have torn myself away even if so often I wanted to look away.I thought it would be another trashy mess, I really did. But what I got was a slow burning narrative of youths 'so far from home' whose slight sense of dread grows and grows until it ignites in a terrifying bacchanal of evil.All they wanted was to have some fun but eventually it becomes apparent that playtime is over, at least for them. The film has a hypnotic pacing an visual style. Not giving up the good for quite a while.With so many people smugly parading generic schlock as 'superior horror' just because it didn't have a drop of blood, I like to remember this movie and think, it's not about the viscera: they intrigued me, they told me a story, they created characters I cared about by giving them depth and insecurities. There's a key scene where the protagonist talks about an experience in his childhood some viewers felt was just shoehorned in. But to me it made him more like a person. He felt like someone I could have known and it justified his motivations later.The final act of this had me on the edge of my seat. It doesn't let off for a moment. Usually a good movie is unpredictable. This movie managed to let me guess what was coming and still be terrified: ('no, no, no don't do it! Please!' I said).On one level a story of our capacity for empathy but that's shortchanging it. This is a nihilistic depiction of one person's vicious experience.There's even one laugh out loud moment. It totally works in context, you'll know it when you see it.I know a lot of people want you think this is just schlock and splatter. But this is something special. This is among the greatest horror movies of all time and it delivers in every respect.",10,1,3,14 February 2020
The Babadook," Not as smart as it thinks it is but I'll take it over a lot of other supposedly superior 'horror'.
","The first scene was laughable but from the second I got the immediate impression I was watching a superior horror movie.The conflict between a bereaved mother and her problem child is enough to make dark, unsettling viewing even without the horror elements.But I take issue with these horror movie antagonists who feels the need to just mess with their hosts for 60 minutes before just killing or possessing them or whatever it is they want.A lot of people have stated 'metaphor for depression' and I really don't want to give it that much credit. I liked the beautiful art within art in the form of that excellent book that just keeps coming back.But although rather chilling and engaging with two horrifically convincing performances as mother and son not seeing eye to eye there is so much wrong with this. Despite the relative freshness of the story (I know it's an incorporeal terror in a house that terrorized people apparently for fun but trust me it's fresher than a lot of other movies with the same premise) there are so many wrong notes.In one seen the phone rings and all we hear on the other end is a strained voice saying 'Babadooooook...Babadoooooook'. This immediately makes the thing something corporeal and kills the mood almost irreparably. Various other shooting tricks that should have been left in the '20s also make the picture more funny than scary. And what is up with them showing movies within the movie?This is a movie with some good talent behind it sadly collapsed under its own smugness and complacency. But you could do so much worse.",6,0,1,13 April 2019
Madagascar," Sequels are better.
","Even at about 11 years old I still found this to be an underwhelming movie.It's hard to put my finger on what exactly it was...its sitcom style humour and plot plus the obnoxious angle of friend eating friend (because, you know, he's a lion...) didn't do much for me.With animated movies we often expect a lot of visual wit but this is one of those movies which seems to think that animals dancing along to and singing songs of previous decades in a funny accent is automatically funny. It uses pop culture references and somewhat Seinfeldian character types to make up for a lack of actual jokes or a plot that is actually intriguing. Half the time it feels like an episode of survivor.There is so much better to watch with your children, even they will pick up on how this is not top shelf stuff.",5,0,1,25 April 2019
Bloody Sunday," I don't know much history but I know what I'll never forget.
","I thought this was an amazing movie.Now I learned about this in school for a while and as an Englishman I do feel a certain, oblique connection to the troubles. I didn't realise this kind of thing could happen among my compatriots (I'm not trying to belittle Irish Nationalism by calling the Northern Irish my compatriots, it's just how I have come to see them), and I hadn't realised I'd thought this way. It was a real consciousness raiser for me.My biases notwithstanding, this movie is as a hypnotic account of a confusing episode of an even more confusing time. It has the task of representing the mindset of the times, the mindsets, I should say, while still making it into a spontaneous narrative.I'm not an expert so I cannot vouch for the authenticity of any of this, but I feel I can believe all of it. There is a tendency for us to demarcate history from real life. A million deaths is a statistic as Stalin said. But here I really feel history and the lives of regular people converge in a devastating way.At its heart I suppose the movie is a mystery. Not so much who-done-it but a why-did-it. I really felt while I was watching, all the chaos and threat that leads to tragedy while still feeling baffled and disorientated throughout. It feels like a documentary. The dialogue is spontaneous but still rich with nuance. The cinematography is candid and even shaky, giving it an often hypnotic, Blair Witch quality.A movie to never forget.",8,2,2,23 February 2019
The Danish Girl," Just go with it. It's a bit of tragic fun.
","Despite it being rather jarringly in English, this rich fantasy of identity transition carries a lyrical naivety that is actually rather enchanting.Pretty sentimental and has makes no effort to dig deeper in the phenomenon that gives us the plot, if you just commit to just going with it, you get a very sincere hymn not only to gender essensialism but also to breaking free of the bonds that culture places upon us, at least as much as we can fathom how.A restrained and poignant work that one must remember is based on a fairly loose novel not the actual biography of its main character.",7,0,2,30 November 2019
Balls of Fury," I'd take this over a lot of other comedies from the 2000s.
","It's rare we get a comedy movie that really is just fun without being weighed down by schmaltz and a subtext.This goofy adventure in celebration of the world's most under-rated spectator sport isn't exactly sparkling, but it has passion, imagination and makes you want to feel silly as people get serious over something that's actually pretty trivial. Except unlike most sports, it's fun to watch.
Great central performance really helps.",Null,0,0,7 February 2020
Ted," Oh Seth...Thank you for existing.
","Being an admirer of Seth Macfarlane for a long time, I was hopeful that one day we would get to see him actually make a movie.If you also enjoy the irreverent styling of Macfarlane but want to see it embodied as one linear narrative that balances the absurd in an otherwise mostly realistic universe then you won't be disappointed.Beneath the laughs we actually have quite a thoughtful story of a grown needing to choose between his new relationships tempting him to adulthood and his youth.Ted is an unbelievably likeable character and comedy vehicle that is also able to evoke great sympathy as a thing literally made for playtime yet must try and make it as humdrum adult.One of the few movies that have genuinely made me tear up. A beautiful narrative on the themes of friendship and ageing.",8,0,2,17 April 2019
Spider-Man 2," I'm not putting this one outside with a magazine and a upturned glass
","One of my favourite super hero movies.A great sequel experience as we get to see a character grapple with their own reluctance to be a superhero as it compromises their life on all levels. To deal with supervillians is one thing, but to feel one's own powers betray you because you no longer see yourself the right away is quite another.You have to meet them half way with its blockbuster style sentimentality but don't we all go to blockbusters for just that?Poignant, funny, very actiony and resolves its internal and external conflicts with such finesse.",8,0,0,2 September 2019
Hot Fuzz," Impeccable pastiche of the action genre that is after a point a fine example of it.
","I really struggle to root for cops in movies but I can put my own biases aside for this movie.'Simon Pegg plays an ace cop who is moved to a sleepy village to stop his superiors looking bad'. Thus ran the newspaper review that my dad read to me when we were picking a movie to see. And like he said after words: 'That summary DOES NOT prepare you for what you're about to see.'A pastiche of action movies the same way Shaun of the dead was sort of supposed to be a pastiche of zombie movies but this time they actually are.Pegg is the no nonsense pig who 'cannot turn off' while Frost is the film buff that's only on the force to be like his favourite cinematic actioneers. As usual they make wonderful chemisty and yes you will believe Simon Pegg is a serious character in contrast to his incompetent slacker from Shaun.Many jokes are made on the banality of real police work in the fantasy of rural britain. This is our first act. And then people start dying. It's BRUTAL. I'd never seen actual deaths shown on screen before. But people in the theatre were laughing...it develops pretty nicely as a sort of semi-gothic mystery and then climaxes in an unforgettable shoot-out where the film becomes the movie that it is trying parody (but still funny). It's an expectation vs reality check that then transforms into the expectation. It's awesome.it is NOT for the squeamish. Even if you could take Shaun this could easily be too much for some peopleDespite having an officer for its hero, I'm glad I saw this and I know I will one day watch it again.",8,1,1,17 March 2019
Orphan," Give this movie a home today.
","Agreeable grey tinged horror thriller that gains most of its momentum from an excellent character who just looks and sounds amazing.A bit over confident on how unsettling a swearing child is, but it's still an acrimonious story of misplaced affections and a vivid thriller of competing minds.Not perfect by a long way. A lot of cinematography seems a beat behind but the growing dread as a family with its own problems gets one more that they thought would fix everything. It also suffers from a main character that is not that sympathetic (Kate, not Esther). A tragic character doers not equal someone I want to root for.If a straight man can have a 'man crush' then I don't see why Esther won't be your new 'child crush'.While I'm here I thought I would say: Adoption's an option. An adopted child IS one of your own. They so should have kept the line in the trailer...",8,0,0,16 July 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," What the hell? This isn't for kids.
","My problem with this movie is simple. There's just not enough conflict.I am a grown man who has never outgrown stuff made for children. I actually really like 'Masha and the Bear' and 'Charlie and Lola'.But this movie just annoys me. The girls are happy in their new home, no one seems to be discontent or threatened, there is admittedly a sick mother but we only see her in a state of convalescence. It feels like a TV show aimed at young children right before bedtime but with the pretence of being worthy of a feature length running time.There is some stuff to like. There's some cuteness and a lot of well imagined sequences and images that feel instantly iconic (shame about the cheesy music) and I can appreciate that this movie isn't trying to be riveting story telling but something sweet, idyllic and simple.Totoru himself doesn't really do much and the climax feels really tacked-on. I thought Twilight had a tacked-on ending after not having nearly enough real conflict or high stakes but at least Twilight (in its defence) uses its climax to explore its major themes and is only the first part of a tetralogiy.Bland story, characters and themes aside, this could be the perfect movie for someone who had undergone a traumatic experience and is recovering in hospital. It's really not challenging at all except in how audaciously unchallenging it is.5 year old me might have just about enjoyed parts of this. 10 year old me would have completely dismissed this movie for its lack of antagonist or a real story.it's not a classic to enjoy with your children.",3,7,16,16 March 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," The title tells you when you need to see it
","A redundant and obnoxious adaptation of the pertinent documentary by Al Gore into a fiction movie.With an excruciating cast of humans getting in the way of our set pieces, the ironies of its plot are laid on with a terrible smugness while the makers clearly just want to exploit a topical issue to disguise what is another lazily written action adventure with even more lazily written personal dramas desperately shoe horned in.These environmental set pieces, once they come, are captivating and there is more than a couple of effective moments partly thanks to its droning score backing the dramatic reading of science equipment.It's also occasionally rather drole: 'He was NOT a chauvinistic pig!'",6,0,2,22 August 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," If only it had been the end...

Spider-Man 3," It doesn't suck

Yes Man," Does it deliver? I'd like to give a resounding: just about.
",Amiable high concept comedy that is most likeable when Carey is just doing his thing after bizarre thing and the unexpected consequences thereof.He's as masterful as ever at juggling the hermetic everyman and the man cursed to take every opportunity he's given.The movie is less charming when its female lead shows up and we're supposed to think she's cool.

Cloverfield," I thought this was a remake of Rec once. I haven't seen that
",Bland flurry of shaky cameras and 'total drama'.It all sort of blurs into one wobbly mess of yelling and uninteresting dialogue with characters that don't command a lot of sympathy.I didn't get much feeling of danger. The found footage did not make it feel more real because they had such a stylized approach and a slow pacing.I didn't find the the main menace that menacing either.,5,1,1,23 September 2019
Silent Hill," Probably the best of the game adaptations.
","People are very cynical about videogame movies and admittedly there isn't much presidence for a really good one to really show them how it's done.Videogame horror has that advantage of interactivity so it has less need to keep its menace unseen for so long. I'm not sure I'd call this a horror movie but a paranormal adventure but it's really none the worst for that.The atmosphere with mysterious beings emerging from the perpetual mist is quite terrifying and doesn't lose power for being able to see these bodily nightmares up close.I saw this at 12 and I haven't rewatched but even then I was thinking 'this is more macabre than scary'.But it's fun, it's great to look at and is really actiony.I hate rooting for cops and I do wish they had kept closer to the original story now I know it (I miss Harry!) but it's overall a perfectly respectable ride.",7,2,2,16 July 2019
Ocean's Twelve," Another cool no brainer that manages to make you feel by turns smart and dumb.
",Fun Same-again-please sequel with a plot that does swerve and twist in an agreeable way but it also pretty stupid in many respects.The structuring can be jarring but I felt like going easy on it for its nifty retro cinematic style with more than a little of the French New Wave about it with its freeze frames and sudden switches to black and white for flashbacks.,7,0,0,27 March 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," It hasn't aged well.
",Kind of dated. I get what it's trying to say and it's not that it's subtle it's just kind of lacklustre. I'm a bit so what about it all.The multiple characters of Peter Sellers just feel self indulgent and it takes a long time for this movie to smugly come round to the revelation that not all politicians are the most admirable of people.It's not a comedy and it's not a dark comedy. They tack on a comedic tone to the familiar red scare paranoia caricatures and you can almost here the canned laughter.And of course you shouldn't fight in a war room. That's not ironic at all.,5,4,14,30 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," First bit's good.
","I love the first act of this. The sets, the creatures, the little flourishes in the adventure...Jabba is formidable, you really feel like you are in a place of superlative vice and corruption. Best part of the original trilogy.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is somewhat anti-climactic by comparison. There's little to go at this point and the forest moon of endor is a bit plain compared to Tattooine. I like the Ewoks I just think they should have been contextualized better.And Luke is a bit...gone. He's become this kind of monk, he's a bit full of himself. The charming everyman from the first two movies is long gone.",5,1,3,21 March 2019
Knocked Up," sterile comedy and mawkishness
","I think I get this movie. It does that wonderful thing that American movies do in telling dramas using characters that feel like they have been snatched from sitcoms.But I greatly dislike this movie because I hate its characters; he's not a lovable loser, he's just annoying, and she is just kind of stuck up. The movie DEPENDS on you believing in their coincidental romance and rooting for it against the back drop of the worst married couple ever. I can dark some dark stuff, Family Guy does that impeccably. But they make it into a joke, this is just humour with a lot of darkness inserted.It's not intelligently made, I don't care to see care free people have their lives disrupted by an inconvenient pregnancy, there aren't jokes so much as banter and the attempt to left itself with sentimentality makes me nauseated.Pick one; be dark or be sentimental. You can juggle brutality and pathos but that takes a lot more skill than this movie has.",3,1,3,23 March 2019
Megamind," The real evil, is not seeing it just because you don't have kids.
","It's tempting to say this tried to do for the superhero genre what Shrek did for fairytales. But I guess the difference is that Shrek was really a misunderstood hero and Megamind is the real deal villain which is a pretty bold move.It's not like he's not nuanced. During the opening origin story spiel it's hard to sort of shed a tear for him so that he is actually a remarkably sympathetic character and I was so rooting for him when he makes his jail break, so bad ass!What we have is a self conscious subversion of a very familiar formula that asks some very intriguing what-ifs about the hero-villain dynamic sort of reminiscent of the artists villainousness of the Joker.The pacy, always developing plot is most diverting and WIll Ferrells extravagant villain is just a delight against the smug do-gooder hero character. David Cross and Tina Fey also really bring as this movie proves itself worthy of our attention and avoids all the most obvious routes.A lot of the animated movies targeting families often don't set the bar high for themselves as they indulge in lavatorial humor and too many pop culture references but here we have something solid. It's not less mature than Ferral's other work (yeah, I know); it's just a story with a real substance and developed characters that is animated just because that's the easiest way to realize what it wants to do. Though animation is never quite easy I know...If you want something that can appeal to a wide section of the generation spectrum, something accessible to people who can't spell but yet totally isn't excruciating, despite it's off-putting poster and title, you could do so much worse than this.I also kind of liked the depiction of later in life romance and a sexy older woman in the prime of her life that unusually rocks the short haired look.",8,0,0,25 June 2020
Alien," It's very gradual
","It's positive qualities notwithstanding, the thing they don't tell you about this movie is how slow it is. A slow burn can be great but the characters are so bland that it just seems to stall intermittently, relying on the few really epic moments to keep the audience on their toes.My favourite part of this movie is Sigourney Weaver's anal cleavage.",5,3,12,21 March 2019
The Book Thief," As someone who gave up on the book really early this was passable.
","A rather charming little crowd pleaser that like Schindler's List before it tries to take genocide and make into a daytime movie.Not a lot of substance and virtually no edge, it's still pretty effecting though the angle of death as the narrator (obligatorily carried over from the novel) just feels arbitrary and excessive here and is an example of narration just being used as a lame excuse to not tell the story visually.And it's in English. Which is NOT OK. They don't even pick a language and stick to it, she's all like 'nein, nein, nein, don't do that'. Which is a new level of dumb and cost this movie a grade from me.",6,1,1,9 September 2019

Horrible Bosses," Swell fun that isn't actually that dark.
",This movie was so not marketed well in my country.I thought it was just some generic workplace comedy but they actually try to kill their respective employers!It's not even that huge in the dark comedy department; it's just a swell and delightful little romp where three semi-competants try to pull of the unthinkable thing we've all thought of doing.Comedic performances are all impeccable of course (American movie) and the whole thing is just what you want on a friday night in.,8,0,2,28 April 2019
Tangled," It's not terrible.
","After 'Brave' I made peace with the fact that we were beyond the era of the Princess movie and there simply were no more in the marble to be found.But this proved me wrong. Not only does it tick all the boxes it should (the songs, the humour, the feudalist whose bustle I'd love to inspect), it is a refreshing and incredibly progressive narrative where we have a male and a female lead working together. Both become well developed with their own sets of talents and flaws and their relationship truly develops in a believable and heart capturing way.With it's superbly summery aesthetic, this is a movie to defer to an idyllic summer evening with your favourite people.",10,0,1,20 January 2020
The Grapes of Wrath," its not so bad.
",One of those movies everyone says is brilliant though it seems a bit plain and dialogue heavy at first glance.With very melodramatic and stylized dialogue and performances all round this does hit home the brutal reality of people pushed to the edge by nature and pushed over the end by the desperation of people.It's easy to miss out on the nuance but it's over all a likeable enough feature that composes itself very well visually even if it is a bit over eager to shove the poverty down your throat.,6,1,3,9 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," That'll do, J.J. That'll do.
","Who the heck am I?When my parents took me at 6 to see Phantom Menace, I thought it was the greatest artistic achievement I'd ever witnessed. I still feel the prequels are under rated.I'm indifferent toward the original trilogy if truth be told though I did rather enjoy episodes VII and VIII.This movie had a ton of pressure on it but ultimately it justifies its two hour runtime.As my brother pointed out: it movies quickly and efficiently from place to place, the characters knowing what they want to do in the short run and then doing it and that neatly taking them to the next thing and this happens across many worlds of contrasting textures from dessertish to stormy.With all the epicness and sense of conclusion and development that you would want, I did think they kind of dumped the 'return' on us unceremoniously and I still maintain that Rey is a hard character to really feel for because she doesn't show enough vulnerability (I call this Hermione Granger Syndrome).One could go one forever listing the things that it didn't do so I won't dwell on them. But I am indeed happy with the Kylo/Rey dynamic even if his motivations can seem a bit esoteric. He is still a compelling character and perhaps is the best performance by any actor on screen.There is humour, don't worry. Mostly from C3PO most not entirely. And I was so tearing up at one point, you'll know it when you see it...Overall I don't think you'll regret seeing this is the theatres if you had any enjoyment from the previous two movies.",8,2,19,31 December 2019
Rocky II," You know what to expect.
","One of those movies that sort of feels more like fanfiction isn't worse for it.We get basically the complete 'what happened next' treatment complete with the family planning (or lack thereof) which plays gently and appealingly.The battered gloves realism of the first movie is long gone, even in this first sequel in stead we get some wish fulfilment but the whole is impeccably tailored to suit the taste of that undemanding die-hard fan.I felt cheated they didn't have a new montage song, as cool as the montage is.",7,0,0,11 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I think it's good.
","I think people are unreasonably hard on the prequels.I think people have an idea in their mind what a Star Wars Movie is supposed to look and feel like and because they have so much nostalgia for the originals (often since they saw them very young, before they'd seen many movies) that they subject the prequels to an impossibly standard.I don't want to make a case that they're some intellectual experience, they're the basic blockbuster experience. But so were episodes IV, V and VI. One doesn't owe it to a movie to like it, only to judge it by its own terms and I think, when viewed as a movie by itself or at least as a sequel to Phantom Menace, it brings everything one could have expected it to.The vivid science fiction world -building serves as our back drop to a haunting vision of a man drawn into dark forces by his own desire to protect his loved ones amidst a tale of political duplicity and war.Halliwell's described the romance as 'chocolate box' and that's fair enough, but in a movie with a light sabre wielding Muppet, is that really that off-brand?With captivating action sequences, fascinating design and technology, a great sense of humor and characters I really do want to follow and cherish, it can be hard for a very serious science fiction/fantasy to judge its own tone well but unlike Lord of the Rings the prequels really come through for us.",9,3,4,7 November 2019
Romeo + Juliet," it's a good laugh and is actually kind of powerful in parts.
","These kinds of plays or operas being done with modern dress is one of my big artistic pet hates.But this works. They're lucid about what they're doing, it's deliberately explosive and zany and always visually interesting.It's funny, strange, hypnotic and (pretentious motifs aside) really does whip up powerful feelings for its main characters.Watch Franco Zefferelli's version first of course but once you're familiar with the text THEN give this a try.",7,1,1,19 March 2019
Forrest Gump," Imagine 'Big Fish' but for your 12 year old.
","It's easy to fall in love with this meandering tale of enduring love and unintentional success at the expense of the differently-abled.By all accounts a very sugary movie that is more than a little smug about itself with its often heavy handed approach to serious things in an attempt to prove it is a grown ups movie.Most enjoyable when we just get to watch forest miraculously become someone. The romance is horrible because she is horrible. He loves her because he is psychologically disabled and the movie doesn't play this as the dark comedy it should but actually wants me to feel for them.I can't dislike this for the most part, it's just too whimsical, but 'Big Fish' is most certainly the same basic thing done better since it actually has the cynicism to pull this off without annoying me.",7,0,1,17 April 2019
Ant-Man," He's a lot of fun in a small package. And then a large one. Because he can change size.

Notting Hill," There's Notting much to love
","Here's my issue with this movie: there are so many vivid characters and they're so funny with an army of veteran British acting talent to make them pop off the screen...Yet the main focus of the movie is on such a bland character with no personality beyond feeling sorry for herself and looking good naturedly over sunglasses.The movie actually tries to sell you the idea that she should have your pity.Like most of this kind of movie, the central narrative is derivative and plain but all the little moments of comedy that adorn it are a joy.",6,3,8,25 July 2019
Bird Box," It is not the movie that it should have been.
","I have heard a lot of articulate criticisms of this movie so I'm going to keep it simple.This could have been an engaging movie if it had primarily told the narrative that its marketing suggested it was: she travels from A to B, avoiding some menace with Medusa/Basilisk rules.But no. It focuses on this flashback where the protagonist and a bunch of other undeveloped characters in this house under siege from the menace. It's at once very slow and forces way to many characters and ideas into a short space of time. It has too many coincidences, it demands me to admire a character who is actually too reckless to like and Sandra Bullock's character is just cold and annoying.I played cinema sins and it scored 165. Even the present set part is wasted as it gets eclipsed by this arbitrary theme of maternity. It is completely contrived and unsatisfying. Even if you hated kids, if you had to take care of a couple you would give them names, even if you didn't think about it. You wouldn't call them 'boy' or 'girl' unless you were making a point. And why didn't the guy name them?They wasted a great concept and a beautiful setting.It's watchable in parts but brace yourself to be annoyed.",4,2,3,10 February 2019
American Pie," I don't want seconds.
",I try to appreciate what this movie represents for people. The painful humour that is the agonising process of 'coming of age'. The frequent humiliations en route to attempts at bliss.The humour is therefor basically just people being cruel and getting mortified. You might say it's karmic but they're good at making you route for these characters.I don't like the humour and I've never liked these movies which shamelessly attempts laugh after laugh with bodily functions and then tries to add on a message about 'true love' or something but it is far from the worst offender and it does throw the audience a bone by the end.But the only really good part is the nudity though that's tainted by comedic sociopathy.,4,0,6,4 August 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Just another blockbuster and not one of the really good ones.
","I don't get the hysteria around this movie. What is it that people are going mad for? It just seems like generic high fantasy that every Power Metal album is telling (much more enjoyably in my opinion).I get it's based on a book that defined fantasy fiction for a generation but that doesn't make it any less dated. Dorian Grey was written even earlier but it's movies still seem fresh.What really gets me with this movie is how SERIOUS it is. I don't mind a serious movie and I am very willing to believe a fantasy story can have just as much substance and nuance as a novel by Dostoevsky (I presume he has depth, I've never read him. Nor anything by Tolkien and I don't plan to).But this is SO stone faced it becomes risible. And no, it's not some kind of adult take on the fantasy genre. An adult movie wouldn't be so simplistic as to color code the horses. The Nazgul OBVIOUSLY have to ride black horses while the elf (who is WAY TO TALL to be an elf) just as obviously missed the sale on black horses and gets a palamino. Because good guys ride white horses. Nothing to do with ethics or tenacity, it's all the horse.This movie has nothing to say beyond 'once upon a time some little people had a magical adventure where they had to go from A to B and nothing else beyond this'.Maybe the other movies expand on certiain themes, I have not seen them. Don't tell me the ring is a metaphor for corruption or impunity like the Ring of Gyges because they do nothing with this idea other than make it a good ex machina.What recommends the movie is the behind the camera talent. It all looks pretty stunning but a lot of it is simply wasted since the story gives me no reason to really care about this world or any of the bland under developed characters. I am literally more invested in the narrative in Rhapsody of Fire Concept albums based on the sparse usage of spoken word. I really feel Ralph Bakshi, while maybe not having the same technical skill or resources to realize this world so impressively, just had a better understanding of how to not just make a world look real but feel as it's a place I could go and want to go.The hammed up, over-acting, the cheesy lines ('it's the fairy queen!', the paper thin plot stretched to breaking point over 170 minutes (I was thinking at one point that the movie wasn't half bad so long as they wrap it up soon and an HOUR later they did), the only aspect of the movie that really comes up trumps is the score which I hate to love.If you aren't into the books...even if you haven't seen this movie, you've seen it in a thousand other things that may not have had the budget but had a lot more heart.",6,4,16,14 April 2019
The Thing," You've gotta see this. Amazing on every viewing.
","I don't think there's much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said.This phenomenon of a picture has two main selling points:The magnificent practical affects that make a lot of recent stuff feel old fashioned. I feel like I could reach out and touch the things being show (and I could have if I was there). The technical proficiency and the grotesque imagination is perfect for anyone who obsesses over strange organisms. It's striking no matter how many times I rewatch it.The other selling point is that we have a solid piece of horror story telling here. In the isolated wilderness, the routine lives of some scientists finds something that they could never have anticipated. From the very earliest scenes with a helicopter shooting at a dog there is a feeling of unease and mystery that quietly festers among an oblivious crew (but who could have seen it coming)?It loses none of its power as it transitions from chiller, to science fiction masturbilia to taut thriller where you don't know who to trust.If you haven't seen it just see it. This will still be fresh 50 years from now because of its intelligent, folkloric writing and expertise.",10,2,4,2 June 2019
The Hills Have Eyes," A justified remake.
","I saw the original before I saw this and it took nothing away from this experience.Generally I'm inclined to believe that the only reason to remake is to make better but I feel this was a quite justified update of a movie that needed to be updated.It wastes no time; the initial assault is quite captivating and I was never checking the running time.The movie has a brutal, unclean feel of regular people being put through an earthly hell where the antagonists seem unbeatable but with a very good motivation for facing them.Tense and with a real sense of danger for all characters involved, it stays with you.",7,1,2,16 March 2019
Kung Fu Panda 2," One of the worthier animated sequels that makes me excited for part 3.
","Hitting the ground running with a beautiful prologue using, I guess you'd call it cut out puppetry.Thus they establish a mission statement to not try to fix a formula that was never broken while still trying to give it a new sheen.The most memorable aspect of this movie is its antagonist. Having said that I think they wasted him a little bit. I don't mean that he doesn't get as much air screen time as he deserves, but they show us this amazing, charismatic formidable bad guy with a theatrical edge (wink wink) and he is so badass a part of me sort of wanted to route for him instead. Sadly they decided to commit him to the role of clownish villain when he could have been so much scarier. Again, it's not campiness that dampens it but that he is so blatantly an emotionally damaged character he starts to look pitiful when if they had had more of a feather touch he could have been an intimidating villain while maintaining a complex edge. In practice his motivations just seems abstractly about power but never mind.His back story is thematically consistent with Po (that's the panda) main problem: this movie is based around that old chestnut of the theme of belonging i.e. wondering who your (birth) parents are. The conclusions this draws are predictable and it can be hard to really relate to how much Po obsesses over biological relation.But fortunately this does not dominate the picture. You will quite feasibly want to watch this a few times for all the amazing visual detail with intensely impressive martial arts choreography and a sumptuous display of sinitic color. The score is unusually infectious for a Hans Zimmer score and all the laughs you'd expect are there with Jack Black in top form. The interplay of traditional and CGI animation is most effective and when it gets sentimental it almost brought a tear to my eye because they earned it.We also get to see Po's developing relationship with Tigress and the rest of the Furious get their moments too.",7,0,0,9 March 2020
North by Northwest," I know a lot of these movies get called masterpieces for bizarre reasons but this one actually deserves it!
","Say it's a sweltering Sunday afternoon and no one feels like doing much.Put this on. Whether you're 13 or 90 there is such a joyful appeal in this fabulous little feature.A picture that truly deserves the title of 'adventure', Carey Grant plays a loveable everyman who is reluctantly embroiled in a fantastic journey dodging plane fire and getting a little tail along the way.Funny, never heavy or serious and with an amazingly well worked out plot I can't even recall, this is a movie to watch again and again. If you think that movies about a certain don't charm you (I must admit I do really struggle with them despite my efforts to like them) this one hits the nail on the head.The best movie from its director, but the real credit goes to Ernest Lehman who also wrote the adapted screenplay for West Side Story.",10,2,4,25 June 2019
Hugo," Expensive looking failure.
","This movie got so much hype but it really doesn't deliver.Although it looks glossy and expensive and has a the sense of being modern classic of vintage style adventure, there's actually very little sense of much at stake. It's the mystery of some toy which leads us to some film makers.Maybe it's trying to be an homage to cinema which I dig but ultimately it's then a movie about movies. Which is kind of lame. Cinema Paradiso was also an homage to cinema but also made itself about life and love and stuff.It's also in English when it is set in fricking Paris.One of those movies polished to perfection but just made of inferior stuff.At one point Hugo wakes up from a surprise nightmare only to find he wakes up from another one. It's that kind of movie.",4,1,4,3 April 2019
The Shining," Good. Because it's hilarious.
","I like this movie, I really do.But what people don't tell you about it is how funny it is.It's too on the nose for me to find it scary. I'm not saying I like things to be subtle, quite the opposite usually. But this is so zany and bizarre that it's more of a laugh than anything. David Lynch Wishes he made this. His movies seem to be trying to parody this.But this feels more original. Nifty images and sequences give a wonderful, darkly comic build up. It feels more like Tim Burton with his brand of macabre humour (until he got really derivative at least) than...some horror guy.But I like it. Not scary but good.",7,2,5,21 March 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," For once a sequel that both needed to be made and did everything you wanted it to. And more.
","The perfect sequel experience.When an impending doom is alluded to in the first movie, a part of you really wants to see how they actually fight it.And this is that story. From its opening scenes of the burning playground, I'm always immediately drawn into what is really a much more powerful and emotionally charged picture than some people would want to assume. Sure we have breathtaking action sequences and machisimo but we also have a narrative of people whose lives have been torn apart by something they never chose to be part of yet still are.The first act twist (I won't spoil it but if you've read nothing about this plot then please don't!) is sort of an obvious move but it is so cool. We get some nifty new Terminator abilities and Arnie is unforgettable as something ostensibly with no feelings but manages to really put some character into this machine (sorry, cybernetic organism). I suppose on one level it's a story about family. Not in the trite sanctimonious way, but as a much more creditable snapshot of people making the best with what they can get.The horror movie vibe of the first one is gone along with the '80s camp. We have a progression to a new aesthetic as well as a totally new tone as this is less about the escape from the indefatigable visitor and more about a real confrontation between the ragtag group and those who would enslave the earth.Does it sometimes push the limits of sentimentality? Sure. But I like to thing it's more about characterisation. Sarah Connor remains to be an enduringly excellent character for her strength but also her vulnerability when a lot of characters in these kinds of movies (especially the female ones) can only show one or the other. It's rather criminal Linda Hamilton never became known for much more than this.A movie that never fails to move me.",9,0,0,11 March 2020
Duck Soup," The greatest comedy movie before Seth Macafarlane. And after but it's close.
","Nearly 80 years later, few movies really top the comedy gold that this brings.It's unfair to really judge more recent comedies by this standard because it's rare to really get an actual comedy since 1964, they're really dramedies. Even American Pie: Band Camp pours on the schmaltz toward the end.But the Brothers Marx literally go to war, and are still really just goofing around. The one liners, the tit-for-tat, the splendid visual gags, the impeccable comedic timing and schtick...this is the archetypal screw ball comedy that is a treat every time I watch it.It's sad there are people using this to parade the idea that no one is funny anymore. They are funny. It's just that the greatest comedy movie ever just happened to come early.It's even better than Seth Macfarlane. That's how good it is. If you liked Ted or the zany intelligence of A Million Ways to die in the West, you will adore this.",10,0,2,12 November 2019
Disturbia," Just close the blind on this one
","Obnoxious attempt to update a vintage thriller that doesn't know what to do with itself or how to judge its own tone.It's nowhere near as funny, tense, hip or imaginative as it thinks it is.At least it passes by more agreeably than the original...",4,4,6,12 August 2019
Edward Scissorhands," The weirdest thing about this movie is how much it works.
","Quintessential Burton. A weirdlicious juxtapositon of lurid suburban chic and bittersweet gothic lyricism.Johnny looks amazing as the cold-to-the-touch hero with a warm inside, conveying a heart rending vulnerability and looking no less creepy for it.Packed with plenty of humor, it makes you want to go along with all its sugariness because it earns it with a good dash of darkness too.I was tearing up.",8,1,2,2 December 2019
The White Ribbon," Advanced feature
",It's easy to believe that this movie was intelligently made. It was a bit too subtle and nuanced for the likes of me.If you really want something that gives you all the credit as a viewer it possibly can then indeed put this on your watch list.I dare say I say it a bit young at 23.,6,0,1,9 September 2019
Rocky IV," Sure it's dumb. That's the fun.
","Magnificent campfest that could have just been an ugly McCarthyist flag waver but backs itself so hard that it becomes a delightful fantasia of masculine splendour.There is basically no real conflict in the entire movie. There is just a sports game and some kind of principle and based on the premise of Rocky V it totally wasn't even worth it.This indulges a fantasy of the perfect life but where there is still one more chance to sort of be a hero. There's no real stakes but the whole is realized with theatrical brilliance. The unsubtle dialogue, the vision of the Soviets as these unrelenting high tech machines going up against the wholesome, chopping wood, training style of the Italian American, the half-hearted interpersonal aspect that is resolved way too quickly (thank god) all make this a fun no brainer.Basically it is a musical. There are some cracking tracks in this especially the amazing 'Hearts on Fire' and so much prime montaging skills.Rocky began as a sincere, kitchen-sink drama of an underdog just trying to go the distance. Now at part 4 it is basically pornography for us weedier guys who love seeing perfect specimens of males killing each other in the ring with a pseudo-patriotic twist.",8,1,1,2 April 2020
Dreamgirls," I suspect the show is better
","Heavy going, soapy and convoluted pseudo-biopic that seems trapped in some sad limbo between straight movie and an actual musical.It has its moments and there's a lot of rich personality in this story of plucky musicians rising from rags to riches but it never feels like more than a fantasy. Eddie Murphy just steals the show and the whole plot is not particularly enjoyable to follow or remember and it just seems to be ticking boxes. I can't help but feel it would have worked better as a TV show, not that I would have stuck with it.",6,0,0,12 February 2020
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," It'll be longer than 40 years before I make love to this movie.
","There's smart dumb humour and then there's this. The issue is not that it's stupid or crude or goofy, it's just somewhat lazy in that that rather than crass jokes, the crassness IS the joke.It's sort of fascinating how shameless they were with this which I guess is its main selling point.But they can't just let it be what it is, they have to poor on the schmaltz and sophistry about 'you gotta have sex with someone you love'. I'd take you so much more seriously if you hadn't said that after a plethora of unsubtle sex jokes. Just own what you are: dumb humour, there are worse things, why not just celebrate sex for it's own sake?Your bodily function obsessed eleven year old will adore this but we need to have a higher standard, even for our gross out comedies.",5,1,2,3 August 2019
She's the Man," I'm going to say this is the best of the cross dressing comedies.
","Does anyone expect an Elizabethan play converted into a teen comedy to be any good?Well it is, actually.I'm no scholar but this was a pretty charming little story of deceit and going under cover which doesn't lay on the sexual politics too thick and instead focuses on being an easy going (but not simplistic) tale of people pursuing the wrong people romantically and then all the right people by the end.I loved seeing Amanda Bynes, I have tons of nostalgia for the Amanda Show and she actually plays a convincing boy. Seriously, she is so cute in this but I could believe she was male (albeit one that hadn't had puberty yet). And she handles the comic timing and the more poignant scenes better than the Amanda I thought I knew had any right to.It's a delightful story about being your true self no matter what other people tell you and does it without being heavy handed. I don't know if that's what Old Bill meant to do but this is worth a look.",8,1,1,11 March 2019
Shrek Forever After," I feel sorry for the Goose but otherwise...
","I re-watched this today and it was better than I remembered.The thing with a sequel is that it's easy to hold it to a particular standard rather than judge it fairly on its own terms. Shrek 1 sort of captured lightning in a bottle and Shrek 2 was a great sequel because it answered all the questions that Shrek 1 raised. Shrek the Third was a little bit of an embarrassment albeit a passable embarrassment but you can tell it did not come from a good place creatively. The complete absence of Arthur in this movie is testimony to that.The set up here is a lot more captivating than 'third'. Rather than the formulaic progression from married to pregnant the franchise steers into its skid by having Shrek lament his own new life, a shadow of his former self, nostalgic for his care free bachelor days. It's a little gross but I can't say it isn't contextually justified even if I don't have a lot tolerance for flatulence of any type.It annoyed me how the movie seems to want me to think Shrek is wholly in the wrong with Fiona not being very supportive. Quick rant: it's important to let parents feel comfortable saying that parenting, though the best job they've ever had, is still the hardest and it can be a bit much. It's indeed a story of how sometimes we need perspective to see how good we have it but it does it well. It's uncomfortable how the ever accumulating list of little frustrations lead to a crescendo of trouble on the kids' birthday bash and it really puts you on Shrek's side.I remember being a bit put out to see a new antagonist out of the Blue but Rumple makes a delicious baddie. He follows the series' trend of effeminate villains but at the same time he is somewhat of a double subversion to see a fairytale villain be the actual villain, not the princes and fairy god mothers we've had so far.I feel I short changed the movie when I though of it as desperately inverting its own characters for cheap laughs but it really isn't that at all. Not only is is good fun to see Ogres as a race, not just limited to the Shrek family, we get to see the real Fiona of sorts in full warrior ogre mode and she is badass. Donkey is funny and classic and Puss...well I liked him and he has some great moments with Donkey.The animation and visuals are as stunning as you'd expect, it stands out from the other chapters with its rich yellowish apocalyptic color scheme and a lot of witches who have some choice moments. The action sequences are there and the gags are never as excruciating as in 'third'. The music is marvellous: not only are the pop songs brilliantly selected the original score will enchant you and thrill you, with all the familiar motifs expertly timed.It will tug at your heart strings as it truly earns its moments of sentimentality. It could not have chosen better closing lines, I'll say that much.I'm truly glad this movie exists. Not only is it pleasant viewing in its own right (clearly below part one and two but a heap above part three) it turns the Shrek sage from a misguided trilogy to a neat tetralogy.Do not get your hopes up or hold in your mind what you think a Shrek movie is supposed to look like and you will not hate this. Well you might, this is just my opinion, the point is this is a tick from me.",8,2,2,18 August 2019
Bad Teacher," Not quite what I expected.
","Cameron gets 90 minutes to prove that she can be more than the wholesome love interest.This unapologetic piece of edgelordism is actually rather refreshing in its celebration of...badness in a world where the goodie goodies win a bit too often.An adequate character arc of a self absorbed character learning to think a little bit less about herself while still not abandoning her identity while she bests the annoying one makes this just about watchable even if the gags are blunt, lazy, smug and mostly annoyingA lot of the familiar trashy humor is present. Remember when comedy was about jokes, not just comic timing? But it has a strange, dark power.In terms of plot logistics the whole thing needs you to meet it half way but you get something of a grand gesture and at least an attempt at character development.",6,0,2,31 December 2019
The Exorcist," Watchable enough and kind of funny.
",I didn't dislike this but it's a fairly nondescript little drama and indeed I would call it a dark supernatural drama over a horror.You can't be that scary with an expert on hand to explain it all to you. That's partly why the Conjuring doesn't work.I do enjoy watching the little girl gradually become more and more demoniacal with its neat effects and visual gags but a cute little girl insisting that your mother performs fellatio in a truckers voice is not scary. It hilarious.Like I said I sort of like it but I just don't see how anyone could think of this as superior horror.,6,0,2,2 June 2019
Saw III," God, this movie annoys me! I wish I had stopped at the second one.
","The big problem with franchise is it's all gore no suspense. I like gore. But that gets tiring when it becomes a predictable cycle.These movies might have had some punch after the first one if you were left on the edge of your seat wondering if they will get out. Let me spare you some time: they don't. Anyone expendable gets the cut.The tedious personal drama at the centre, the sanctimonious soliloquies of jigsaw, the incoherent non-linear plot and all the waxing philosophical about...something. This is a movie that tries to be deep but all it does is slather an unoriginal slasher in pretentiousness to make it seem less stupid than it really is but this has the adverse effect.It's not just frustrating and boring, it's infuriating too.",2,2,3,24 February 2019
Ocean's Eleven," Suck on that, Inspector Morse!
",I'd be lying if I said I could follow this 100%. But this was pretty admirably made as a piece of glitzy fluff adventure with a lot of rich personalities try to swindle the capitalist.It's so good to be able to root for the thieves for once with all these obnoxious cop shows on TV in which the one who holds all the aces always wins.You'll need to have a great attention span to follow it completely but if you did that you'd be Cinemasins guy. It's better to just relax the mind and just go along for this flume ride of clever underhandings and manipulation that by the end actually justifies itself in a way I didn't expect.it is Matt Damon who really shines as the neurotic rookie.,7,0,1,27 March 2020
Spirited Away," It's actually not over-rated.
","One of its writer's better movies if just for the onslaught of bizarre and vivid images that are thrown upon us. It really is quite spectacular and even terrifying at times.Although Chihiro is not a great character, instantly going from brat to scared little girl never to return in a matter of seconds, you really have a powerful sense of being trapped in a strange and exotic land that only grudgingly has a place for you.The plot is fairly engaging as we try to get home and struggle with a few episodes at the bathhouse.Worth a couple of viewings as we explore some interesting ideas on the nature of identity and culture being lost in industrial modernity, we get an ethnically rich and frequently grotesque hybrid of cultural flavour and the monstrosity of big business with only a modicum of the sanctimoniousness that is Hayao's signature.Sweet, funny and again with a score that will be your new guilty pleasure, this may not be Ghibli's (or even Hayao's) best movie, but it's place in those top 100 lists is more of less earned even if as usual it is as a feat of spectacle and imagination, not so much of story telling.On that note we are one climax away from a great movie. The thing just...stops. But it's the journey not the destination. I feel this could have made a very dignified movie for all ages but seems to have been intentionally 'kidified'. Something Frozen thankfully didn't do.Great feature for a new year's eve in with an oriental buffet on your lap and good company.Both English and original versions are equally good.",8,1,1,24 April 2019
Enchanted," This is the point where I would mock the movie by alluding ironically to its title but this time it's actually kind of fitting. So yeah.
","Superb pastiche of the classic Princess Movie that manages not only to deconstruct the formula with mocking venom but also win us over in being a great example of the genre.This was where we were in the early to mid 2000s: we were starting to really see the heteropatriarchal undertones of this kind of movie and its vapidness without really wanting to put it to bed. Tangled was us bursting through to the other side with the contradictions reconciled, but until then, we NEEDED this movie reflect on our relationship with the Cinema of rushed courtship, gender based characters and feeling sorry for Feudalists.As a comedy of culture clash, the urban and the fantasy play mystically well against each other and we have one of the few really convincing romances in disney where idealism meets jaded adulthood and the two bring out the best in each other.I really feel all ages can get something out of this as well as both fans of the Princess movie and those who love to mock it, even if the latter might have to just read a bit of Greer during the lovey dovey moments (which I'm totally into as much as I love Germaine).",8,2,2,2 December 2019
The Love Guru," More like the sort-of-like-it-if-nothing-else-is-on guru. Am I right, people? Right? Yeah...
","Perhaps the most unpretentious movie you will ever see. This comedy aspires to nothing but cheap, dumb gags and paint by number romance enlivened by a master-class comedic performance from Myers.It's pretty good for the Hotel room...It's not impressive but it has this curious talent of being rather charming since it doesn't look down on its viewers.",6,0,0,7 December 2019
Toy Story 4," I'm glad they made this.
","I thought that the third one was an impeccable swansong that wrapped up the saga in a nice little bow.This latest entry makes the story a cool trilogy plus one more rather than a solid tetralogy but that doesn't mean it didn't justify its own existence.Furthering the series' main them of lost purpose and obsolescence, they hit the ground running with yet ANOTHER scene that had me tearing up. The main plot shows a very believable new problem for Woody as he (rather admirably) adjusts to a new home and a new pecking order.There's something rather heart rending in watching Woody do what he clearly thinks is the right thing but also obliquely expose his own fears and insecurities. Despite having undergone three movies' worth of character development already, they really brought it with both the physical and internal conflict propelling the movie in an intelligent way as two estranged friends reunite and respond to the opposite life choices the other has made.The antagonist is fresh and distinctive and also provides complex motivations and grey morality in a way which completely enriches the movie. There are also strangely erotic undertones between them and another new character (not that I'm complaining).This truly is a story about Woody. They do try to give all the old favourites the screen time they deserve but the truth is their character arc is over. Jessie provides some logistical support and Buzz some comic relief with a running gag.All the humour and perfectly executed set pieces are there. I can't think of more to say about them.There is a moment...I don't want to spoil it but the sense of restrained dread it creates is powerful. In this one sentence the writers of this showed more talent than so many horror movie writers do in their careers. I do love a good horror but they totally get that balance between heavy handed and too subtle. You'll know the moment when you see it.I felt this was a convincing and heartfelt effort to further the series in a way that enriched it. It is not a cash in sequel, although it is not the masterpiece that the third movie was, it is still a sincere depiction of the conflict between enduring love and our desire to be loved that, if you commit to watching on its own terms, will provide you with the finale to the series that will leave you more than satisfied.",8,2,2,31 December 2019
Twilight," Still a better love story than La La Land
","Watchable piece of Gothic Urban Fantasy Romance with a great atmosphere in its foggy little one-horse town and a very likeable heroin. I'd marry Bella Swan...Everything is realized with skill and panache making it quite enchanting if you're willing to turn your brain off for a bit.My big issue with this movie is the same one I had for My Neighbour Totoru: there isn't really enough conflict or stakes to constitute an actual plot until just before the final leg.Let me explain what I mean: I assumed that in this movie Bella would have a bad time for a bit and then find happiness in the attention from the handsome older supernatural man taking an interest in her even though the romance would be forbidden. Although Bella is understandably a little melancholic about her distance from her Mom and her new surroundings, she actually isn't bullied at all, she makes friends easily and there are two boys after her. And these boys are two DIFFERENT boys competing for her than the two who are in the sequel.Her Dad actually buys her a car. It's not an amazing car but it's something. Also, everyone on both families is just way too nice about the romance. Not one of the vampires even gives an impression of not trusting Bella. There are so many ways that conflict could be drummed up but aren't.The last act is also rather tacked on. It feels like they realized that they had sort of run out of ideas (by which I mean, miss Meyers did) and conjured up some villains ex nihilo. A similar problem is also found in Totoru.But to it's credit, Twilight's version of a tacked-on climax is used as an opportunity to explore its themes of temptation and immortality and it's only the first quarter of its story anyway. I know how weird this must sound but the Twilight Saga is a bit like The Ring of the Nibelungen in its structure: four parts, with the first really just to establish some themes, characters and relationships. So when people tell you the Twilight is one quarter of a movie, they're right. That's what it was meant to be.Twilight is an inevitably fascinating picture for the phenomenon it has been culturally. I sincerely believe this shift in how we want to see vampires tells us something about our culture and Meyer's own Mormon faith only adds to that. Edward is a vampire but he is one divorced from the religious subtext of Stoker or Polidori. He is not a demon, he is just a man (note how I didn't say 'person') dealing with original sin and temptations he knows he might not be able to control so virtuously tries to resist until he cannot anymore. He is blessed and also burdened with an immortality of sorts and the power to bequeath it but is unwilling to do so too easily, much like the Mormon God. (seriously check out Mormon theology; it is not Christianity as you think you know it).The element with the Native Americans too is interesting given the racial element of Mormon scripture, this tribe sort of serving as a stand in for black people.Having read the book, I think it captures the tone of the book and gives it a professional polish as well as anyone could hope it would. Go in with an open mind and really suspend that disbelief and I think you'll find something quite passable.",6,2,4,23 August 2019
Bridesmaids," Keep your bouquet.
","I can't help but think this was either made for women or the men who hate them.This began a wave of wedding-goes-wrong movies and this one is my least favourite of all of them.I found this a deeply unlikable parade of crass gags and painful situations where people just embarrass themselves one way after another. The protagonist is sympathetic but I don't enjoy watching her struggle the way she is.It does not judge its own tone well and although there was potential to be a poignant story of the desperation of adults to preserve the older relationship as they get ripped apart by adulthood and the institution of marriage, it's not.With a script that relies on excellent comic actors to bring the jokes to life for it, too much time is devoted to bodily functions and trying to convince men that women have no conciseness beyond weddings and showing each other up. This is the opposite of what we meant when we said that we wanted more women in movies.",4,1,3,22 November 2019

The Favourite," There's a lot more vomiting in it than I expected.
","A much more vivid and darker movie than the marketing would have you believe. An elegant, hypnotic and atmospheric journey into two different but equally disturbed psyches, one with too much power, yet powerless to the one she loves and the other a nobody who will stop at nothing to become...well, guess...It's sort of funny, it's sort of lyrical and it's sort of disturbing but it would be misleading to label this movie with any of those adjectives on their own.And they get sexy too...",8,3,6,17 October 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll recoil in disgust and then laugh anyway.
","Thoroughly compelling, well paced, thoughtful and pertinent piece of horror-comedy (post-horror?) that deftly sends up horror tropes and is the most satisfying bout of script flipping since Shrek.Sort of like Final Destination but without a supernatural element. There is a macabre majesty in how unfortunate circumstances turn a group of people that otherwise would have no inclination to harm a fly against each other in class fueled sectarian carnage.Don't think this is just a horror parody or some sort of comedic pastiche of horror like Shaun of the Dead or The Scouts guide to zombies or Zombeavers, this is the real deal. The comic tone only intensifies the brutality in a movie about prejudice without being sanctimonious and with a genuine heart at its core.My only issues with this movie are that line 'I worked on a farm, it was either work or get out' which rubbed me the wrong way for some reason and how they don't give enough character flaws to the more rural characters beyond maybe some lacking people skills.",8,0,0,16 October 2019
It Follows," Basically the anti-Conjuring.
","I tell people I like horror. But it can be so hard to find a good one. Even one that doesn't ultimately annoy me. Even the ones everyone says are superior kind of annoy me, like The Conjuring. This movie is sort of...the anti-Conjuring.But this one is different. Before watching I had a firm idea of the kind of thing I wanted to see in a horror movie: characters move into new location, uncanny things start to happen, characters only gradually become aware of an incorporeal menace and never fully appreciate the amount of danger they are really in.This turns that around. We are informed very early on who is our enemy. They are tangible, identifiable, a character literally points to it. We know its attributes; it's invisible to everyone but one specific target, it will appear as different things to the one specific target, it cannot be beaten in a fight, but it walks everywhere.We know how it goes about things but not why. And the movie never tells us. There is no lengthy scene searching the web. It gets no name. There are no 'paranormal experts' popping in to arm us. It's not a supernatural thriller marketed as a horror. This is legit.We are not confined to one area, the movie does not waste time cruising for our sympathy with kids and a dog and a family. We have a bunch of teens that need to keep moving. It's breezy and often somewhat hypnotic with its low key tone with a sense of danger always on the low boil, the sense of dread and urgency still never leaves you. Never. There is also an agreeable utilisation of backgroundsit's not perfect: I feel the movie really spoils its own atmosphere when the follower shows emotions (hissing; why do all horror monsters hiss now?), but it is testimony to the freshness of the movie that I can look past this and still give it 8/10.I don't like the lavatorial stuff either but whatever.I know it became a sort of 'indie darling' but don't let the pretentious fans put you off. Buy or rent this movie.",8,1,2,21 February 2019
City of God," It's probably well made but that's little comfort.
","I want to like this movie but it just takes itself a bit too seriously.It's a vivid depiction of poverty where there is a serious civil war going on just beneath the surface of a vibrant city, with its own elaborate politics. The sense of place and local colour is stunning.It goes on a while without a lot of wild developments. For a palate more refined than mine it's probably very enjoyable, but I couldn't personally recommend it.",4,0,1,22 March 2019
Cars," Even their underdog still has some things to like.
","A lot of people consider this to be one of the underdogs of pixar and indeed I agree that it was the first movie by them to not be sheer awesome.Its simpering story of a hotshot learning to stop and smell the roses while he's trapped in a small town isn't exactly what anyone was expecting, the adventure is nil, the drama and character development is layered on.To give the movie credit, it's probably a little misunderstood. It came from a long line of movies that involved characters physically moving from A to B while we have a character who was literally made for that purpose yet he finds himself grounded. There's a nuanced sense of character, creative dialogue and something to like regarding the story of how a fast moving world left the small towns behind.There's a lot to bet annoyed about too (just check the cinemasins) but the usual disney magic shines though what is ultimately a failed experiment.",5,0,1,18 April 2019
Get Out," Go in knowing it can't meet the hype
","Perfectly watchable little tale on the Horror-thriller spectrum.Could have easily been a fair bit better than it is with a script that is somehow very subtle in some areas and painfully on the nose in others. Missed some potentially excellent fridge horror moments.But I like the story, it's fresh, well paced and has well developed characters. The racial aspect seems more cosmetic than substantial to me, not that that really takes away much.I feel the script deserved a more experienced director. It's not badly directed but there are several scenes and instances that just feel naively realized, especially regarding the generic score that gives the audience a heads up about what they're supposed to be wary of which kills a lot of the horror potential.But despite the many wrong notes, the film is essentially made of superior stuff and if only we could maybe get a differently edited version ,this could be a masterpiece.",7,1,5,11 November 2019
Insidious," If you've seen the Conjuring, you've seen this.
","3 years before The Conjuring they had already made it.This semblable example of a Dark Supernatural Thriller trying to pass as a horror is just as heavy handed, just as obnoxiously cliched, just as simpering with its bland, normative characters learning the hard way that 'ghouls just wanna have fun'.With its less than original black and brownish filter making it feel even more factory produced than it already is, the occasional atmospheric moment makes me want to try and put my guard down and enjoy it as an oldschool horror. But every time I want to meet this picture half way it does something to make me just go 'f#*@ you, movie'. Whether it's an in-your-face effect, using a sudden burst of strings to kill a frightening moment (seriously, that's the horror equivalent of a laugh track) or any of the many cheap scares.Like Conjuring they bring in the paranormal experts. That's why it's a paranormal thriller not a horror. They're more focused on world building than actual chills.It feels more like a Simpsons halloween special so often that I wonder if they should have just made it a horror comedy but it takes itself way too seriously to be taken seriously. By the end, the only pleasure I could get from it was to laugh at its own expense.Even its ending (which has real potential) wasted its own potential by clumsy execution.This decade has been the best decade ever for horror. But this is everything wrong with the horror of this decade. This didn't annoy me as much as The Conjuring but it was pretty dang close.",2,0,0,1 July 2019
Frozen," It's OK.
","Various other positive qualities aside, I think this movie perfectly embodies the present time and where we want to be going.A story of two individuals, a sort of sense and sensibility set up, where one is taught to resist one she loves and her inner power only to then embrace the chaos. It's story of individuality, of the dangers of both too much and too little self control, and of course, of enduring love.It is a love story, that's how i see it. Plattonic or unplattonic, it works either way. It revives what I thought we'd never see in a contemporary princess movie and confronts all the negativity in those movies too.I will never think of this as a kids movie. It's a movie that deserves the attention of all ages.I want to marry Elsa so much but, in accordance to the movie's values, maybe we'll go for coffee first.",10,0,3,20 January 2020
The Number 23," 18 out of 23.
","I remember seeing this when I was like 15 and I was captivated by it. Instant classic I thought.From start to finish we are plunged into an incredible mystery that is ambiguous throughout whether the grasp on reality many of our characters have.The use of the two parallel stories was a gamble but they pulled it off very well as our regular, if eccentric hero reads a book that has surprising connections to his own life.Stylish and strange, the alternative story-within-a-story allows for a more expressionist take than we're used to seeing in movies that get a lot of marketing with rich and often shocking uses of color.Jim Carey is captivating in this more serious role where he actually shows a superb amount of restraint in our gradual descent into obsession that may or may not be necessary.Looking back maybe it was more predictable and campy than my adolescent mind was able to pick up on but this is a complex, thought threw, audacious piece of story telling that you really need to see just for the experience.",8,1,2,23 June 2019

Schindler's List," Great for those who fetishize the holocaust but don't want to think deeply.
","I reviewed this movie far more thoroughly back when I had a different account but I want to have one on my profile.The basic problem with this movie for me is that it is not the movie it should me, not unlike Bird Box. It SHOULD be the story of Oskar Schindler saving some Jews but it's actually just an exhibition of the holocaust.There's little plot and as much as I like the macabre of genocide, it gets tiring just getting death after death without much sense of plot progression.It's smugly blunt about its deaths without giving any real reflection on why this atrocity is happening. Then there are incongruously lyrical monologues.It's a simpering and ostentatious historical slasher that jacks itself off over genocide without any real depth or characterization, imaginative moments notwithstanding.Also, this is in English and that's not OK. Why go to such depths to recreate a particular time and place but then ruin that illusion in such an obvious way? Doesn't the German language convey the tone so much better?Don't get your hopes up...regarding the IMDB ratings it is, for me, the most over-rated movie.",3,8,15,22 March 2019
The Elephant Man," You have to see this. Even if you hate Lynch's other stuff, just do.
","I adore this movie.From it's first scene I was captivated. I wish more movies would start with an abstract sequence. I rewatched that scene twice when I was done. It was hypnotic, delicate yet quite terrifying in a unique way.It doesn't disappoint when the movie begins properly. The stark black and white cinematography paint a vivid picture of industrial pictorial London. It feels like a fantasy but that's the charm. I think they did use Ultra high frequency so it's TECHNICALLY in colour, just the only colours black, white and grey. The effect is a crystal clear picture of a world that swings between immovably clinical and sordid.There is a fairy tail feel as Joseph is rescued from his cruel owner (not historically accurate, the freak show owner was a friend to Joseph, but who cares), built not from magic but a story of victim of a cruel nature finding tenderness.It would be so easy to make a story that felt exploitative, or trite or both with this premise but the handling is delicate enough to appeal to cynical pretentious teens (like I was) and find a real pathos, never quite losing its dark power.Perhaps I'm a little biased by the make up. It is endlessly fascinating to watch John Hurt in make up and listen to him speak in that magically refined yet impedimented voice. I thought the movie would just be unsettling and I was indeed quite terrified of the build up to seeing Joseph. The essence of it though is a dignified message of enduring humanity in a dark world that never gets mawkish thanks to a feather touch that rises only at just the right moment.It was the first movie to make me cry (excluding the Never ending story but I was pretty little then). It really is a beautiful experience, not surrealist exactly, but stylized in way we don't often see. It makes me wonder what other marvels Lynch could have given us if only he had been on a short leash all his career.",8,2,2,18 February 2019
A Quiet Place," A mawkish place
","The trailer really made me want to see this but the moment I saw this movie being plugged on the Graham Norton show, my heart sank. I have no issue with mainstream movies or movies from big companies and I hate it when people are snooty toward them. But horror is slightly different. When horror is made for a general audience, rather than people who breath the genre, that's when things go wrong.The Director actually pegged the very issue with the movie when he said he felt it was a movie 'more about family'. Did he think he was being fresh and original? Movies like that are ten a penny, within and without this genre of science fantasy adventure. A direct, unbiased depiction of people in desperate circumstances committed to being terrifying that is well made...now that would be something.Even if we choose to not call it a 'horror' movie, just some kind of macabre adventure, it's not like I have a problem with pathos in either. I think it can really enrich a picture about physically terrifying things when we get characters we can see ourselves in, whose plight moves as well as chills us, what some people would call 'making it human'.But there is a significant difference in pathos and sentimentality. A story, especially a monster movie like this, needs to earn its sentimentality by giving us characters that we can relate to with time to make our own minds up about them. This movie oozes a certain smugness about how it is some kind of hip, new age,tear jerker-horror, and although a lot of scary stories have been improved by having that kind of element to it (Silent Hill 2, Eyes without Face) the handling here is just a bit too aggressive. The cinematography zooms in to wring out the feels, the simpering performance from the Dad who always looks incredulous to something he's just seen and the elegiac tendency of the score all add to this.One particularly sickening scene was the Dad dancing with the mother, I know that sounds innocuous but just wait and see how they visualize it. This tonal approach does not only make it hard for me to lose myself in the dark story it should be telling but also makes me struggle to really believe anyone is in a a huge amount of danger. Toy Story 3 was able to put me on the edge of my seat even when I knew there's no way Woody wouldn't survive to see the next one. But here the plot armor just feels too thick. Whether I was right or not to assume that is besides the point, a story is a journey as much as the destination. Thus a lot of what the movie does well is kind of wasted on itself.I've been very negative so far but as my numerical rating would suggest it isn't really half bad (if you keep your expectations low like me). It's engaging for all the reasons you expect it to be. It has a good concept, a certain amount of atmosphere (reduced dialogue and sound is a bit of a cheat code to that but whatever), a lot of interesting logistics on how they maintain this lifestyle and several well crafted moments of suspense with a superbly convincing set of special effects.To keep myself amused I watched with French subtitles which you can do on Netflix at the moment. And no, I did not miss nuances because of that if I my toot my own horn.The rest of this review will be mainly me listing all the particular small things that annoyed me about this movie:1) They flash up what day number it is. Tell your story visually please, obliging non-diegetics are not scary.2) They show their menace WAY too early. The first time showing it should have been that scene with the nail. And they have a cliche sound too. They could have done so much more to stagger how much we glimpsed at what time but they didn't.3) The daughter is deaf. Really. And it is just a coincidence. An audience can take one coincidence sure, but any motivation for this coincidence comes way too late. Now I think about it maybe the family survived this long because they already knew ASL? I'm still annoyed though.4) Too much back story. The crux of horror is mystery. I don't want to know there are exactly 3! Just make them different colors or something.5) The mother. Emily Blunt's obnoxious portrayal and the irritating characterization made me hope if one person got killed it would be her. 'Who are we if we can't take care of our kids?' Shut up!6) On that note she is pregnant for most of the movie. I am really sick of pregnant people in horror movies. It does have relevance to the plot to be fair rather than being there strictly to manipulate us into feeling for her rather than actually giving her a personality that doesn't suck. I'm not really mad that they made her pregnant, my problem is that they were a bit...*family values* about the whole thing if you know what I mean.7) The final seconds of this before the credits had my raising a particular finger and saying ' f&ÃÂ£# you, movie'.8) This is something I have only learned reading the FAQs but apparently the creatures are known to have arrived on Earth from a meteor. I mean, I missed it so I guess it was pretty subtle (or maybe my French isn't actually as good as it could be), but it is such a rookie mistake to outright tell us where they're from. I know the cosmos is a big place I'd rather have the origin of the creatures a mystery. But this is emblematic of how one should not think of this as a horror movie; to do so is to ask to be annoyed.In conclusion, we were not cheated exactly but we were spared a classic because they were in denial about what genre this move really is.",6,2,2,16 March 2020

Ex Machina," From the machine, right into the feels
","A movie at once a throw back and very modern.I almost thought that we had ran out of ideas for movies of this kind, this speculative science fiction, not too hard, not too soft, balancing the right amount of technical 'talking shop' and basking in the radiant glow of human creations.Yet it is the humans who are just as much a star of the show as our machine. Not only is the freshness of the machine in how she is defined by her humanness rather than her roboticness, the organic characters give us much to chew on both in their fascinating conversations and when the plot grows thicker.Even with the limited settings and characters, we find a strikingly atmospheric and eerie journey into a few questions about our own humanity and our attempts to simulate it that so could have just been another pretentious exploration of the 'human condition' with a vendetta against the smart phone. Understand that it does have a few interesting things to say about the changing relationship of people to technology but its intelligence is that it sort of says them by not saying them. It's all there if you want to infer it but it's not necessary to get the most out of this story.Arguable on one level a love story. A gripping and touching meeting of two people (even the word 'people' is an interpretation I guess) and how it develops.I love the comic style adventures, I really do. But it's hard not to adore this resurrection of the old school speculative science fiction.My one real note is the machine. She walks too much like a real person. If she could have walked the teenciest bit less humanish then I would have been more sold on the illusion. But that's just an extra they missed, not really a flaw. But I noticed it.A charming, poignant, adorable and mentally stimulating experience that haunts the mind for reasons that are hard to articulate.",9,0,1,6 November 2019

NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind," Imagine Princess Mononoke but a lot less green.
","Let's start with the positives.It's a spectacular movie to look at. The imagery and the stark post-apocalyptic landscape are what power metal musicians only sing about. There is a powerful sense of menace with amazing monsters and technology. The music is of course captivating too; bold, majestic and eerie right when it needs to be.Now for the negatives.Basically everything that was wrong with Mononoke. It's a preachy parade of left wing sentiment. Now I am usually the most far left person in any given room but that doesn't mean I think anything kind of pro-environment with a female protagonist is going to be instant gold. A movie needs more substance than just political affiliations.Naussicaa is not a heroine who is easy to like. She has no depth beyond being a mouth piece for the writer. She is given no room to develop or review her feelings. She's right and everyone else is wrong. She is smug, sanctimonious and condescending.A message about peaceful reconciliation is fine but the movie only makes a very shallow discourse about it. Naussicaa is clearly capable of combat but her tears over the movies only victims is just mawkish.No doubt some glutine free home schooling parents will enjoy this with their kids, content about how they're keeping the toxic masculinity of disney from corrupting their kids, but it's no less pandering.

It's easy to get caught up in the mystique of the adventure.The romance just kind of goes through the motions and some of the character motivations can seem kind of abstract.Overall enjoyable if you're willing to just open yourself up for it.,7,0,1,4 November 2019
Men in Black II," The cartoon was a much better follow up.
","A likeable but forgettable comeback that is at its funniest when agent K is still neuralised in an excellent bit of role reversal.I don't like new serious J but I guess he was always a pig before he was MiB.None of what made the first one truly memorable, even the make up and effects, although technically excellent, just seem lacklustre in the imagination department.",6,0,0,30 April 2019
Children of Men," Not particularly stimulating but fun enough.
","As good as the premise is, it's really just a gimmick to get you into this unoriginal military thriller.I love the filthy, sordid world they create with everything going to sea. There is a sensation of how there is not one singular issue (as there never is) and I'm not saying the movie was completely without nuance but it's not going to make you think too hard.The characters were bland and the movie isn't above being a little trite once in a while but it's well realised and there is a palpable sense of perpetual threat plus, the presence of Michael Cain alone gives it some credibilityThere's even a laugh or two.",6,0,7,21 March 2019
The Football Factory," Who are ya' who are ya' who are ya'....a good movie, that's what.
","As perfect an evocation of the ultra-masculinity of the england football hooligan scene as anyone really needs. I'm very outside looking in at this but even a footy-hater like me got enchanted by the romance of the scene.Handled with humor, brutality and a strange lyricism.",7,0,0,18 September 2019
Mulholland Drive," See a Svankajer Movie instead.
","Gotta say, I found this movie annoying.Surreal should be a selling point but this is so excessive, non-linear and seemingly bizarre for the sake of bizarre, I might recommend as a study in how off the wall a movie can be, but not as an example of surrealism done well.",3,1,8,12 April 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," The best from its studio.
","One of the most powerful, moving and charming pictures I've ever scene.It handles war and the macabre alongside pathos and low fantasy with such a masterful touch that one wonders if we could ever see it again.Please do yourself a favour and see it. Even if you hate animated things.",9,1,1,18 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Dude, it's Star Wars, you will find something to like...
",Rather over whelming piece of Science Fantasy that is hard to follow and understand.Hamill holds his own as the most charismatic force in the film though I did find the developing Ren/Rey dynamic fascinating. Both serve as a way for the series to really contemplate itself.If nothing else there is a zaftig asian chick.The plot as a whole feels at times more like an episode of TV show and doesn't always convey as much significance as it should but doubtlessly there are many sequences along the way that will be worth several clicks on the scene selection.,7,6,25,3 January 2020
Brave," Aesthetically pleasing but derivative adventure
","You may remember how the trailer to this gave you very little idea of what the plot was about.Well she accidently has her mother turned into a bear. That's what happens. I was watching this think 'wait...haven't they done this idea before? Emporer's new grove did a similar thing but with a Llama, The Princess and the Frog did this but with frogs and Brother did this but with...the exact same animal'. I know Pixar IS NOT Disney. At least not in essence.I'm not saying that each of these 4 movies don't have their own nuances, styles and ideas to explore, only it seems a bit of a tired idea by this point.The first act has an ostentatiously feminist verve, like it's desperate to be this decade's Mulan. But we don't need another Mulan because we have Mulan. Is it saying something else pertinent about feminism? Not really. We have a heroine, the kind that idents love to call 'plucky' or Feisty', who filches apples, who pouts in an unladylike way and then uses her bow and arrow like a boss.The first act seems pretty engaging as she dares to compete with her own suitors 'for her own hand'.But this movie that was so happy to wave the flag of girl power thought it was good idea to turn the whole thing into one of the most effeminate road trip movies you can imagine. I don't care that one is a bear. Is it really feminist to make this just some female analogue to a Goofy Movie? Or to adnadone the badassdom to just have a story of female bonding? (I suppose they're the same thing as much as I love A goofy Movie).I'm not saying there aren't stuff to like: these kinds of movies always have a lot of visual wit and talent that draw you into the world they've created with its details, textures, rich characterisation, inoffensive but wonderful humor and general sense of wonder. The radiant aesthetic of the Celtic autumn, its sound track full of local color and pop ballads (that you will hate to love but love all the same) plus the scope of its set pieces make sure that seeing this is not a waste. It's just that it's main plot got a bit misguided.What made Mulan so wonderful is that Mulan wasn't sure which world she belonged to more and was on just as much of a learning curve as the men in becoming a soldier. Of course I need to stop thinking this is trying to be Mulan because it's clearly so different but, as anyone who has a seen a Miyakzaki movie will tell you, taping on some progressive colors does not mean you have instantly charmed every progressive in the room.One of the lesser efforts of its studio but it's still not half bad.",6,0,0,17 April 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," There's a talking raccoon...I like that.
","Really fun, comedic, sci-fi adventure buddy movie (except there are 5 of them).With many memorable scenes, formidable bad guys, a distinct visual style and brilliant characters that play of each other amazingly, this will be one to watch again and again.Have your tissues ready too.",8,1,2,5 August 2019
Evil Dead," Should have stayed in the Suburbs, Tessa
","Speaking as a big fan of the original, this was not superior but it was good.While the first made sure to go all out in the hysterical and unsubtle this tries for a more distinctly gothic approach: the color scheme is dark and grey and very serious.It gets very real. The supernatural menace is no less close to the bone for being supernatural as well fleshed out characters confront something they can't possibly begin to understand.And Tessa from Suburgatory is in it!",7,0,1,2 September 2019
The Evil Dead," Bringing the artistic credibility of gore back.
","Once upon a time there was the idea that horror movies were just festivals of gore and shock with no actual frights.Then came some horror movies that didn't have any gore in them at all. But they didn't think to replace it with anything so they didn't even have the one redeeming character of the other type.This is why The Evil Dead is so refreshing. It's not another generic gorefest but neither does it have a phobic attitude to a little blood and viscera.The texture of this movie...it's almost cartoonish in it's camp usage of the macabre, with its cackling demons rapacious flora. It's pretty terrifying being confronted with this hellish little world that went from just another camping trip to worse than a nightmare. There is a...rawness about this movie. Maybe it owes something to its troubled production somehow, but you can feel the pain the characters are going through in an unpretentious meditation on reality as you know it going completely insane.A welcome antidote to that breed of horror that thinks we won't notice its cliches just because it does them without splatter.",9,0,1,5 March 2019
Shrek 2," A sequel fit for an Ogre.
","Shrek 2 is the perfect sequel experience.It works partly because it answers all the questions raised by Shrek 1. it also uses for its premise the very complications and implications that would arise from the conclusions that the first movie gave us.The first movie was about a hard edged individual marginalized by a prejudiced society rediscovering his own capacity for tenderness and beating some stereotypes in the process.Now we have the same character desperately trying to aspire to these new pressures placed upon him and worrying he cannot quite measure up without help from a magical source.Some people felt this movie sacrificed heart in favour of pop-culture gags but I feel this is solid story telling. Shrek 1 (as much as I love it) loses a lot of momentum in the middle, after they've saved Fiona. But here it's a none stop adventure across physical land and the self (mentally AND physically) with all the anarchic humour and epic fight scenes that made us love the original.One might have thought they were jumping the shark with Puss, but he supplements the action brilliantly, complimenting rather than eclipsing the impeccable chemistry between Shrek and Donkey even if he is really just there for comic relief and with no real substance but then again I suppose his own story really ended with his own prequel spin-off. It's funny because an ogre was the antagonist in Puss's original story... XDThe fairy Godmother makes a delicious villain and J. Walters could not be more impacting as the darker side of class, again, subverting the classical fairy tale with a fresh panache. Prince Charming too could not have been better characterized. It could have came across as a little homophobic but they judged it just right.The peripheral cast is all there and used to great effect before we all got sick of them.The textures, the command of music original or otherwise, the plotting and the sheer razzle dazzle of the whole thing makes this a wonderful picture to enjoy again and again no matter what age you are. Its existence is truly justified and the only thing about it I'd object to is its use of lavatorial humour which i'm a buit sensitive about.But in conclusion, if you're going to see one animated sequel ever you could do little better than this.",9,3,3,25 November 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A video game adaptation that skipped making the excellent game
","This is exactly the kind of movie I like. But I struggled to get into this.I think Tarantino made the error of thinking that a tragic heroine was the same thing as a sympathetic one. I don't know if it's the curt script or Thurman's smug, complacent performance but I found the bride to be a deeply unlikable character. I didn't want to root for her but almost did for the final battle because her opponent was even harder to like. I don't love to hate them. They just annoy me.This is definitely a pretentious movie in my opinion. Stylized is good. But this movie seems to have no lucidity about itself, it's deadly serious for the most part despite its bombastic plot and content. The few moments of humour just feel jarring and out of place, not because they feel crass but because it makes you wonder why they had the tone the way they did.So there's stuff like a sudden animation sequence, that's fine. But you can't just shove that in our face as if it's no more expressionistic than just doing a montage. You need to sort of gag your way into it.This could have been amazing. But the style and the videogame violence (I do really want to play a game with this kind of violence) just fall flat because I don't feel in on it. It's so full of itself and annoying that, no, you certainly CAN see one without the other.I keep taping Volume 2 but I keep putting off watching it because I have such low expectations for it.",3,0,4,22 March 2019
Saw II," This is the last Saw movie remotely worth your time.
","I think it kills the effect somewhat to really meet Jigsaw. Tobin Bell is captivating as this quite but edgy killer but god is he an obnoxious character nonetheless.A lot of this makes no sense. Just watch the Cinemasins. The characters are loud and annoying and it goes nowhere particularly satisfying.The traps are sort of cool but it's a gimmick that wears thin. Without having a central trap like the first movie, it's all a bit of a mess structurally.",5,1,2,24 February 2019
Here Comes the Boom," That's the title you went with?
","I was not optimistic about another sports comedy but it's curious how much charm this tale of an underdog just trying to hold his in against the system has.A lot of this is attributable to Keven James' rascalish charm even if he does take a very 'no means yes' approach to courtship. Henry Winkler is also a treat as the hippie music teacher who we are supposed to love they make us do it by showing, not telling.They do not skimp on the sports content here and as a non-sports fan, it's very intense. The combat cinematography is breathtaking and it's easy to appreciate the grandness of Scott's undertaking starting at the sordid bottom and journeying to the big leagues which involves more than a little suspension of disbelief but they meet you have way.A sentimental picture to be sure but they earn that by rich characters anda professional approach to plotting and visualization. At times it may indeed feel like a mix of Nacho Libre and Rocky with just a dash of Dead Poet's society but it works.An uplifting story of struggling agaisnt a corrupt system that makes it easy to just want to give up but never impossible to inspire.",8,0,1,8 April 2020
Jurassic World," Best yet (probably)
","As good an update to a semi-dated classic as anyone could ask for.With humour, the sense of adventure and danger expertly applied, the movie sends its own franchise up a little bit and is charming in that respect.Of course it's visually stunning. You might say it's derivative and unoriginal but so is everything Spielberg's ever been attached to. I gave it 8/10 what more do you want?Oh, and I love that workaholic character who rises to the occasion in when things get pear shaped.",8,0,1,5 August 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Redundant remake but they had some fun with it.
","I won't say this isn't enjoyable in a high fructose, corn syrup drenched, blockbustery way.It really isn't Roahl Dahl's Charlie, it's Tim Burton's Charlie with Dahl left far behind. (Actually I suppose it's the screenwriter's Charlie, whoever that is, I'm too lazy to check).Grotesquely funny though never quite as much as it thinks it is, they really fanfic this s#@* up with Wonka getting a back story even. The whole thing has a luridness that can be hard to get used to, but is weirdly appropriate for what was always a rather bitter-not-so-sweet story.Charlie is similar to his counterpart from the other movie yet strangely synthetic and hard to like. The depiction of the loving but poor family is way too maudlin.The other kids are actually quite captivating. They're bratty but they've got a good bit of spunk (Or should I say spice? ...no) and they are a pleasure to watch with some great young acting behind them, especially a really Violet Beauregard.Depp's pantomime Wonka is by turns fun and painful. It's Johnny does what he can but the script should have picked a lane. You can be funny and creepy at the same time but the ingredients were just applied in the wrong quantities.The imagery is imaginative but it can often look pretty fake.Ultimately, nothing close to the magical, funny, emotional powerhouse it seems to think it's capable of being but if you go in expecting it to be trash it's kitsch good fun.Like the book, the narrative is flawed by the real conflict ending way too early and relying too much on coincidences.",7,1,1,23 November 2019
The Hangover Part II," It's as good as it is unoriginal.
",It's basically the same movie again in a different setting only they cross more lines.it's none the worse for that though even if it was at times too dark for me.,8,1,2,3 August 2019
Hotel Transylvania," About as much life as its cast
",Excruciating and infrequently lavatorial romp that coasts a bit too much on its tribute to vintage horror.The schmaltz and dumb gags are just poured on.It's perfectly watchable but I would not but it high on your list of things to watch with your six year old when there are true masterpieces like Despicable Me and Inside out in the world.,6,0,1,9 September 2019
Big Fish," Perfect in its own way.
","This movie is basically Forest Gump except even better. I'm not trying to c*** on Forest, he's awesome, but this brings something special.A collage of bizarre encounters and experiences with a deft sense of comic timing though never quite losing a disquieting tone, this is a delightful weirdness trip that also has something unexpected up its sleeve.It's not trying to touch the feels the way FG did. it's not meant to be Zeligesque or pseudo-historical, it's the gaiety of the tall story that uses narration as narration should be used; to supplement the picture, not as an excuse to not tell the story visually.Not heavy, but with hard edge, this is a festival of anecdote telling first and a meditation on the blurring of fantasy and reality second. I personally don't do unreliable narrators and just take everything at face value. It's more enjoyable that way.This is an understated movie that lets you follow it on your own terms. It's fun and has an ineffable poignancy of an unassuming sort that I rarely see.",9,1,1,17 November 2019
The Dark Knight," Giminy Willickers, Batman! They've returned your credibility as a serious live action superhero!
","Impressive and formbidable retread of familair comic ground, compulsively not like the Adam West era.Sometimes falling short of being quite as profound as it clearly thinks it is, I wonder if we could use it being about a half hour shorter but of course the Joker steals the show in a terrifying yet hilarious fashion (I didn't think of Mark Hamill once), the whole is very dark. I mean literally.If you're not in the mood for it, it can be quite a slog but well worth seeing at least once.I've never seen Batman begins and I don't think I lost anything for it.",8,0,3,27 October 2019
Annie Hall," Not aged well. Not a high brow movie but a thoughtful and interesting one aesthetically.
","Maybe one day when I have a lot more life experience I will rewatch this and think 'Wow! this is so clever and deft and assessing modern relationships and is a hilarious bouquet of daring narrative techniques'.But for now I am very unimpressed by the minimalist approach. By this I mean two things: the very laisszez fair approach to visualization with a lot of long takes and static cameras and also the simple narrative in which rather than a linear story we get a collage of episodes that illustrate this sometimes passionate, sometimes floundering romance.The crux of the problem is no interesting characters or intrigue to really get us started. They're in a relationship from the beginning; there's no meetcute or even a meet-painful to subvert that trope. I guess Allen was trying to give us a sort of anti-romance, the thing 'The Break-up' should have been.But although I'm a big cheerleader for Allen's vision of the hypochondrical, self-hating New Yorker, he simply hasn't much going for him with the context provided. Annie herself basically has no personality asides old fashioned sweet girliness. Yeah, she wears a suit and she looks fabulous. But it just seems arbitrary.The episodes themselves are just mundane. They aren't gags, they're just bland slice of life in that unhappy medium between being funny or being poignant. They're neither.The surrealist gags are sort of interesting but they get old really quickly because they are more gimmicky than clever. To give a couple of examples: at one point they converse and we get subtitles. But these subtitles do not convey the subtext of what they're saying, they just give inner thoughts therefore totally missing the translation element I was expecting. At another point we get an animated section where the sudden animation basically IS the joke.I suppose this was sort of edgy in the '70s but now it just seems like the same tropes that are the bread and butter in modern relationship humour.The 'innovations' like turning directly to the camera are also just gimmicks that aren't used to any effect. Bug Bunny did that and he did it in a funny way.In fits and starts I sort of want to like it. It's not an obnoxious movie and it comes from a good place creatively. Allen and Keaton play their parts impeccably even if the script is never naturalistic or stylized enough for them to ever do much with it.The exact romance depicted is agreeable. It neither burns bright or hot but is a convincing meeting of two different types of people having a believable connection even if it isn't a viable one. I like the lobster motif. I did not laugh once.I would recommend 'Crimes and Misdemeanours' or 'Whatever Works' above this movie if you're curious about Woody Allen and, like me, you don't find 'relatable' humor that funny.It isn't a high brow movie, it just stepped out of the mould for a bit.",4,0,3,4 October 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Another interesting failure.
","It's hard to know where to begin with this movie or how to say something that hasn't been said before.I'd rank this with Eraserhead and Under the Skin of movies I dig stylistically for their visually conveyed plots and enigmatic tone but ultimately is little more than an interesting failure because of the lack of plot trajectory.The montagecraft and visuals are stunning but that counts for little without substance and this movie lacks that both in characters and plot, no amount of originality can make up for that. I dislike how polarized the dialogue level is; we either get none or a suddenly very candid scene and the final plot line with HAL does drag. When a deliberately cool voiced machine has the most personality of anyone in the movie you know there's a problem.I wrote an essay on this movie and it's underlying meaning when I was 15 so I'm not going to say there isn't a lot to chew on philosophically but this isn't a philosophy book. A lot of the cinematic tricks (even the iconic bone to ship cut) is messily handled.At about half the length this could have been good but I suggest you go in just treating it as a feature length music video with spoken asides. The music is pretty well chosen except for an obnoxious usage of Blue Danube. BASIC!!!!!!Ultimately a somewhat admirable, very interesting and absolutely pretentious affair but a different handling could have made it the best movie ever.",5,2,5,30 April 2019
Midsommar," I think I'd rather help Greta Thunberg pick a prom dress for two and half hours.
","I feel very similarly about this movie than I did with Hereditary by the same writer.I feel this could have been a majestic, compact, efficient 90 minute chiller that was a masterpiece of its genre. But sadly this movie drowns in its own over ambition with way too much thrown at us and the ultimate effect is portentous, messy and inelegant.The detail in realizing the picture is certainly very impressive: the rich sense of place and local color alone could almost have made this movie worth seeing if it had been 25% shorter. In short, the thing looks fantastic and very professional (until it gets confident but I'll get to that).Ari Aster is... a lot like David Lynch. By this I mean that he is a film maker that has a marvellous imagination, a rich mind for stories a certain boldness that some people think has gone in horror. But he really, really needs to learn how to self edit. He is surrounded by too many yes-man (and women) for some reason. Like Hereditary, it's hard to verbalize exactly what is wrong with this movie because it takes the form of so many little things that wreck the mood like wrong notes in an otherwise well composed piece of music. Seriously, someone who call tell him 'Ari, baby, you're script, she's phenomenal! Just take out this, this, this, this, that and replace this with something less convoluted and we've got gold!'.The first 20 minutes alone gave me so much to chew on: the way that tetraptych flies open like it's a preschooler's show, the way they cut away from the intense Nordic Winter with that phone ringing as if it were a comedy. The word 'scary' twice! (show don't tell) and then something I've been seeing in more and more horror movies that really gets to me: we begin with a something horrible happening. Which would be fine except it *has nothing to do with the rest of the frickin' movie*. And no, don't try to tell me that it's thematic and part of the character's journey. This movie had 150 minutes to sell this to me and I still don't buy it. Dani Is a bland, one dimensional character with no personality beyond feeling sorry for herself which she has every right to do, given the circumstances, but it makes for tedious cinema. She is not an interesting protagonist. That should have been Chidi. He is the one character who really feels like a character, rather than target practice and the acting probably played a part in that.Other bizarre cinematic choices like a strange obsession with reflections which might have been atmospheric if they'd spaced them out more but there's two scenes in the first act where someone talks to someone off screen but we see their reflection...if there might have been good if there were some theme of self discovery in this movie, but there really isn't any more than any movie. And another time when they match cut going into one room and into another...it's so obvious they used a trick set it ruins the mood. And when the camera says 'screw it' and goes upside down...now I'm a sucker for stylized cinematography but there needs to be a physical justification for it. Maybe a character leaned back and saw the world upside down for a moment...but no...ellipsis, ellipsis, ellipsis....Another issue is how it seems to be Dani's story and yet we keep pulling away from her. But she annoys me so I'm not sure how much of an issue this really is.The film is a blur of excessive plot points, obnoxious characterisation and misjudged dialogue. I don't care about Dani. I just don't and she is played irritatingly. The thing I really like about this picture is curiously the thing everyone who likes it hates: the slow atmospheric scenes where you can't resist the sense that some unseen terror is coming. We so don't get enough of that in horror, not now, not in yesteryear. It does feel a lot like rip off of Wicker Man sometimes but that's it's strongest element. And that sinks in all the other stuff...And the ending...well, I won't spoil it but wowee I have not been ticked off at an ending so much since Knock Knock. I raised my middle finger to the end credits and told movie exactly what I think of it.in conclusion, some magnificent film making is wasted, even ruined, in a hubristic attempt to make what could have been an admirable horror movie into an exploration of the human condition. An expertly made cake with 3 grams of human excrement is still a bad cake, and that is sort of how I feel about this movie.I did stick with it for the full 150 minutes to be fair and I'm sure there was fun along the way (best sex scene ever...) but my final emotion was not boredom or frustration but white hot anger. You'll understand why when you see it. Or maybe not...Fudge this movie. I love that it's trying to be something beyond the cookie cutter teen scream horror but a film needs to do more than look the part.",2,6,8,3 April 2020
Puss in Boots," Someone give this the cream. But non-diary because you're not supposed to give that to cats. It's good it what I'm trying to say.
","You know, when I first heard of this I did not expect much. Total cash in that would be worthy only of home media, I thought.But I was wrong. This was so well devised and thought through, keeping with the same fairy tale gimmick but now with the caliente back drop of Spain rather than the medieval aesthetic of Shrek.An engaging, funny and also very poignant narrative of old relationships and new ones each alike being tested. Letting Puss meet his match in a female cat could have felt pandering but they handle it very well.In short, a great animation experience worthy of being in the same regard as Shrek 1 and 2.",8,0,0,25 June 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," An antagonistically tedious and lazy movie
","I hate this movie. It gives no impression any effort went into any of it.It feels made up on the spot because it is; they decided on scenarios and improvized. Not in the cool spontaneous way like in Creep 2, but in a cheap 'let's just half-ass this movie' type of way. It's very insulting.Some of the jokes have potential. But they all miscarry because there obviously isn't the comic timing to pull them off. A lot of the jokes don't even make sense. Why shouldn't they put an 11 on the scale? Either stress that they know that it doesn't increase the maximum volume or respect that more intermediate settings is useful to them as musicians. The scenes, dialogue and jokes show no imagination. They seem to have been going for a hoax movie. But what's the point of that? Just watch a real rockumentary.It does not parody or satire. It just checks a list of things rockstars have done and does them. It just rips off reality. It really expects you to laugh at them ripping up small bread. I think it's meant to be a point about how rockstars can be divas but please try and be more creative. Asking to have all the green gummy bears removed: now that's what I'm talking about.And those drawling, ugly British voices... I'm British myself and I hate it.In terms of how it all adds up scene for scene I'm tempted to say there is no movie I hate more than this. At least 'in Search of the Titanic' is so bad its good and was ballsy enough to be far out with a lot of weird scenes. This movie gives me nothing but a couple of good songs, hence why I gave it a 1 instead of a zero.Apparently its very on the money if you know rock history. But so what? Even if this movie is esoteric, Robot Chicken does a great job of making the joke clear even if you haven't seen the show they're parodying.I don't mind people liking stupid movies but telling me that this has anything smart about it just annoys me. I struggle to see how anyone can like this. This makes Judd Apatow look like Seth Macfarlane. It's not clever. It's not well observed. It's an artistically incompetent exercise in self-indulgence for the easily pleased rockthusiast.Gruellingly tedious to sit through.",1,0,24,9 March 2019
There's Something About Mary," What happens to Ben Stiller in the bathroom is less painful than watching this.
",Woefully hateable comedy that doesn't even attempt to make a joke about its bodily functions but relies on its physical comedy in itself to be the joke.There is nothing about Mary! She is a forgettable McGuffin and the way this movie pummels me with humour that makes early South Park look like recent Family Guy to only then pour on the sickliest kind of shallow romance makes me want to punch a wall.That Diaz has not publically disowned the movie is a discredit to her.,3,1,3,22 November 2019
La La Land," Go in accepting that it will not meet the hype and this isn't half bad.
","I feel instinctively hostile to this movie. I think there's something rather smug about its attempt to be an homage to the vintage musicals. Now I love the vintage musicals and the idea of reviving them, I really do, but when it's done like this, what I am inclined to call 'oscar bait', I become very closed to it emotionally.Certainly it's all very professional. It even has the impressive feat of feeling at once cinematic and capturing that distinct sensation of viewing something live. The musical and dance numbers are radiantly envisioned and realized and I'm sure could be enjoyed again and again, even if the music is mostly just adequate.The story did not grab me at first. There's something about the the idea of a musical about show biz that I find just redundant; it's a hat on a hat. It's already a MUSICAL so why did you base the plot on this? I know it's a throw back but the plot just feels like a template to jam in those impressive numbers.I didn't feel vivid characters. I felt the same old meek female, jaded guy pairing we've seen a hundred times before without variation.I liked the girls walking down the street to the party in their dresses (red, blue , green, yellow respectively; it really works) and I also felt the audition montage was impeccably pulled off. I found the lecture on improvized music more annoying than anything. It's like a joke: if you have to explain why it's so clever it's not funny. Similar principle for music.I did however warm to the move and its characters about two thirds in when we start to see the more brutal reality behind the romantic front we want to see. The ending may well have you in tears, it's quite something.",6,0,1,5 November 2019
Saw," Tense, powerful and original.
",The sequels may have ruined its reputation but I thought this was a wonderfully original horror thriller.There's a palpable sense of filthiness and claustrophobia in that bathroom that isn't ruined by scenes that take place out side of it. I was on edge every scene as every decision the characters made mattered and had to be considered carefully.The menace of Jigsaw is immense even without him even appearing for much of the screen time.A vivid experience that none of the sequels could get even close to.,8,1,2,11 March 2019

","I don't want to sound snooty but this is typical of those horrors made by big companies and marketing to a mass audience, not that the less mainstream ones are better or worse. It's very dark tinted, it uses that familiar style of score, it has a plot element where she goes to the place and find out all about the antagonist etc.It's better than it has a right to be though. It's got a good set up, I really feel for it's wannabe punk rocker heroine thrust into loco parentus. It's a visually engaging movie as strange things lurk always just out of clear view while never going down that actor-clearly-halloween make up route.It's an expensively made and well produced horror for a general audience that is no masterpiece that may not make sense on every level but isn't hateable.",6,0,1,10 June 2019
Sinister," Not perfect but it's not as trashy as its name suggests.
","Despite the lazy title I thought this was an above average horror movie.The heart of the movie is not the menace though, it's our main character, someone who has built his life around telling true stories on the hunt for a new one and when he stumbles across what would be the true crime book of the century risks taking things a step too far.That very first scene is (unusually) a good indication of the quality you can expect. The tantalising mystery we discover alongside the main guy made me feel conflicted on whether I want to tell him to get out while he still can or to keep digging that little bit more to uncover the mystery.The other characters are pretty annoying but a lot of visuals make up for that. The movie balancing the unseen menace and the seen menace pretty skilfully. Which is rare.I feel a bit cheated by the ending but overall this was refreshing.",7,0,0,11 March 2019
Life Is Beautiful," The best war crime comedy ever made.
","A magical and captivating movie that you must see at some point in your life.Yes, it's a comedy set in a concentration camp. It's one of those rare movies that set out to make you laugh and cry and actually manages it within one, well developed tone.It makes me want to try liking people again.",9,1,3,12 December 2019
The Fly," Justified remake
",A fresh reworking of the old story that justifies its existence.The make and effects we're all waiting for take a while to come but are more or less worth the wait.Like the first it's a haunting but poignant account of a man consumed by his own quest for knowledge and progress that adds the grotesquery the '50s wouldn't have allowed the first one.,7,2,3,18 June 2019
How to Train Your Dragon," The Power of the Dragon-Friend.
","It's well established that animated movies seem to mostly be marketed as family movies.It is almost equally well established that such movies have shown to be just as nuanced, intelligent and mature as much or more than their adult-targeted counterparts.A lot of movies of this kind sort of let themselves down when by lavatorial humour or an over reliance on pop culture references or desperately trying to be down with the kids (not naming names but I'm sure you can think of one). But this is truly a case of an animated picture that doesn't feel like it was made for kids but just anyone. That you can bring your youngest room mates is just a plus.A nuanced substantial narrative of self discovery and how those you think are your worse enemies are people you should trust more (and vice versa).The Norse aesthetic is immersive (if not authentic) and the dragons look super. There is something especially enchanting in trying a more amphibian rather than reptilian look to its main dragon. The developing friendship between boy and beast earns every moment of sentimentality and the danger always feels real (something I always felt Fellowship of the Ring failed to do).I watched using the Polish dub (because Netfix lets you do that) and felt the voices were excellent The protagonist is very charming as an underdog that manages to win through unorthodox means.These movies of two sides learning to work together can be very hit and miss. I feel Miyazaki was always a bit heavy handed with them (no offense intended if you're a fan) but this manages to do it just right. As is typically the case with these movies, each character no matter how minor just oozes personality.And finally, the female lead is handled most pleasingly. I always like these formidable female characters and this one has developed nicely in more ways than one. As much as I adored the Lady Ghostbusters, I think the protagonist here needed to be male just so this dynamic could work believably.My only criticisms are the use of opening narration and that instant attraction with the tsundere.But overall: my father has gone on record to have found two animated movies that had genuinely resonated with him: Treasure Planet and the Incredibles. I am inclined to recommend this to him too.",8,0,0,11 May 2020
Don't Breathe," It's fine.
","I was worried that I was in for an obnoxious 'Ha ha! the old veteran is actually pretty formidable you stupid thieving millenials, semper fi!' kind of movie but it wasn't.The scenes that think they're suspenseful are all very well but they do go one for a while. Nevertheless I was quite satisfied by this claustrophobic battle where we find no one is all good or all bad.This will make you squeamish and toward the end actually manages to be the movie is thinks it is.",7,0,0,19 April 2019
Beauty and the Beast," I bete this will ring your belle.
","Ravishingly beautiful and witty in all respects, this manages to that sweet spot of familiar and new that will make for fun viewing with all the family. I think even your cute goth little sister might even like it more than she cares to admit.A different approach to the beast was most fascinating. I was a but hostile to a voice and countenance that wasn't bestial enough for me but partly owing to a great performance that helped me see that he is just a person. A daring move creatively but one I admire.The new music is tops and my only real qualm is Watson who I found a bit too smug and flaccid in the role.",8,0,0,30 January 2020
The Descent," A real Let down
","I'd heard that this movie was 'not like other horror movies'.Well, It kind of is (like them).It annoys me when these kinds of movies try to milk empathy from the viewers by showing us that people are doing the whole nuclear family thing, which is swell, but I'd rather find empathy for them by actually having some characterization. On this note, once the movie begins properly there's a tragedy and it has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. People love to quote 'we all lost something that day' but that's not the same as it having any real consequence.And do they just let the tragedy speak for itself and hint at the hurting with visual clues? You should be so lucky. And what is the deal with those hospital lights going out one by one? The crux of horror may be mystery but there is a difference between being mysterious and just making no sense.So we get 'one year later' AND 'Appalachian Mountains, USA'. In case you confused them with the Appalachian mountains in Slovenia. And here come the girls... Now women are great. I love to see women do everything men can do. But please do not make a mainly female movie if you're going to make them all one dimensional and forgettable. No, Juno was not a formidable character. That was an informed attribute. I had no sense of character, no sense of relationship beyond that they tolerate each other. And we get five minutes of them drivelling on. I believe a man can write memorable and believable female characters. Women are just like people after all. But no.Before they even get to the cave you get a bunch of crows. After they get to the cave there's a swarm of bats jumping out at us. This is the level of freshness we can expect. It even does my least favourite thing for a movie to do: have a dream jump scare. Something shocking happens and then she wakes up. I don't care if it's demonstrating her emotional state. It's a cheap scare and only exploits something redundant to the story anyway.So now we're in the cave (and expect a couple more character-gets-scared-but-it's-just-a friend-surprising-them moments). They don't do anything to draw attention to symbolism of spelunking or make it seem like some grand thing. They're just doing it. Apparently the writer thought he was being different by building up to showing the antagonists but all he's really doing is shoving in filler. Like people who give the impression they have something to say by taking forever to say nothing.The pacing of this movie is just all over the place. it doesn't building up, it just stalls. it makes a development and I feeling like it's almost no big deal. I didn't get any of the groundwork on these characters and their motivations and relationships to really believe they could all get into such an unfortunate and stupid situation. A good writer can pull off an infeasible situation but they would put in the work, which this movie does not.The rest of the movie is a whirl of screaming and rock fragments with all the scenes blurring into one. The monsters...they had nothing to do with how they got lost. This movie has way too much going on. I hate the creature design. It's just uninspired. They really expect you believe they are perfectly adapted to their surroundings but they can't smell them? Are you serious?The Descent is a movie that tries to be 'not like the American horror' by taking shortcuts to compensate for its lazy writing and cheap scares. People appearing scared does not equal horror.And God the ending ticked me off. I saw the British version. It just does not respect its audience. What was I supposed to take away from this? What was the point of the car crash?",3,2,9,22 February 2019
Some Like It Hot," No movie's perfect but I was pleasantly surprised.
","I never had high expectations for this movie. I want to believe a movie above a certain age can hold up but I guess I was a bit sour grapes about it because people kept heaping praise on it.There's an intelligence required to write goofy comedy and although a lot of this could be considered low brow, the impeccable sense of timing and efficiency in which the jokes are served and delivered is nothing short of admirable. A real comedy, not a veiled dramedy which is what Judd Apatow does. We get a cool plot that keeps as viewing and its snapshot of gender relations makes the whole thing seem enduringly relevant (but it was never meant to be a movie with a message; that's what's so awesome).The acting talent is amazing. Only Monroe maybe sort of falls short (yeah, I know). I get the impression she is a maestro at being the kind of character she's playing in real life; that sort of animated mannequin that men (including me admittedly) want to date so a lot of the time she is so on the money. But when it's time for her to do one of the more comedy orientated monologues the delivery seems to fall a bit flat. I think it might seem this way thanks to being surrounded by tons of better actors but she is certainly not bad and the script shines through.Frequently kind of eye-rollingly lame (like when they desperately use music to convey that Monroe is somehow more attractive than the other women present) but that does not change the majesty with which so much comedy, both physical and verbal, is flawlessly choreographed and realized (the train carriage scene springs to mind).",8,0,1,31 December 2019
Pulp Fiction," Nowhere near as good as it thinks it is.
","This smug little kaleidoscope of low lives had a lot of potential.But like a lot of its writer's works has aged horribly as it can no longer corner the market on movies with a zany style and now must viewed in terms of its substance, not just its style.The meandering nature of the narrative really has no narrative: there is no intrigue or sense of development. It's not an anthology movie but it almost is and therefor each scene can only really be enjoyed as a thing in itself without context and so lacks both the ground work and the sense of consequence that would make them classics.It's sort of sad to watch it desperately just try to produce iconic or quotable moment after moment rather than apply itself to something a real back bone. It's sort of enjoyable for its sheer bombasticity but it gets old really quickly with no characters I want to root for which would be fine if only there was some sense of pay off on any of the character's fates.Some people jack themselves off to this movie's freshness but I think this is another case of something that was fresh for its time ageing horribly and its enduring cult status is a mixture of nostalgia, emperor's new clothes and people not willing to look behind the make up to see what a pandering little flick this really is.It has its moments but it never seems to aspire to more than a sequence of moments rather than a movie in the familiar sense. You could argue its a meditation of fate and consequence but that just sound a nicer way of saying it wasn't thought through well.It's not just tedious for long stretches, it kind of annoys me.",5,1,3,21 October 2019
Jack Reacher," ...name titles give me nothing to pun...
",Generic actiony thriller that you can so believe is based on a book.Its plot is neat and its hero is most charismatic even if 12 inches have been lost in adaptation.There's not much to say about it except that it is a straight forward paint-by-numbers genre piece that is impeccable in all the ways it should have been.,7,0,0,12 February 2020
Rocky III," Not pitiful.
","Sylvester Stallone said that Rocky isn't really about boxing, he just happens to box, it's really about the journey.But this movie is about boxing. It is made for those who really fetishize this fascinating sport and have an interest in those athletes who gain great success but are then only impeded by their fame and hubris.The most appealing this in this movie are the viscous, masculine performances from Mr T and Carl Weathers. The testosterone levels in this movie are through the rough and if you're into manly men, I dare say you'll find something to like.I wonder if the first act had basically found the conclusions of Rocky II and then the rest of the movie was the first act of this movie, then we'd really have an epic journey, albeit one with a downer ending. But as intelligent as it is on its depiction of how the mighty can fall in modern sports, the movie doesn't really have anywhere to go except by becoming and cutesy bromance than ends with...well, I'm not going to spoil it but if you can't guess how this resolves then...well I'm not sure what to say.Thee are plenty of incidental fun along the way: a fight with Hulk Hogan, 'I pity the fool', Eye of the Tiger, Rocky's hubris in various way...it's not a high prestige movie but if you're into what it's selling, it's a fun one.",7,0,0,11 February 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I think it's as good as the book, but it's all sorcerical.
","For me, the movies will always be a mixed bag and even the first one has its logistical problems.But if you have no experience with the franchise at all, I would ask you to please give this movie a chance. Although it suffers a lot from jolty pacing at times, there is not a dull moments with so much neat design, visual intelligence and sheer imagination in selling this fantasy of the British public school that happens to also be magic. (Public school means private school, here. And my compatriots say Americans can't speak English!)The narrative is fragmented by I like its style as a compendium of adventures that fall into one over arching adventure as we discover a new world alongside our adorable everyboy, a world that also happens to be familiar to the target demographic, playing up our fears of belonging and keeping up while indulging the fantasy of escaping annoying relatives to become a hero in a place where anything seems possible, except getting to school on time!If you can just role with the cheesy kids' movie feel, it can be a real treasure with an evening's sky worth of acting talent really selling the illusion especially Robbie Coltrane as the friendly giant and Maggie Smith as the frightening transfiguration teacher.It's as funny and chicly formidable as you'd expect but it really does earn its moments of pathos as well. The ending always sort of makes me want to cry (in the good way).",8,0,0,11 March 2020
Three Colors: Blue," Not easy to follow but of endless interest.
","A hypnotic an very visual movie with a breezy and gentle approach to story telling even if it is a mostly internal struggle.Complex and nuanced regarding its message and philosophy you could enjoy this wide awake or half asleep, going along with its masterful rhythm.It can be hard to really follow and it is a more than a bit austere. But filled with neat stuff to look at, a rich score and amazing cinematography, there is not movie quite like it, not even white or red quite match it.It can be hard to get, but it is easier to enjoy than understand.It's super watching Juliette Binoche. She conveys grief and detachment in a way that doesn't make me want to gag.At intermittent points in the movie they fade out to music an then return to the same scene. It's that kind of movie.",7,0,0,26 May 2019
Psycho," it's good apart from the middle.
",What people don't tell you about this movie is how much it sags in the middle.I don't want to spoil anything but I think you can guess what happens early on that might do that.I was very intrigued as this movie started. I was curious to see what became of these characters. Then we meet Norman Bates and he is exactly what we want to see in these kinds of movies. He conveys an unintentionally disquieting character. You really feel like you are dealing with a damaged character but one who doesn't wear it on their sleeve like other characters would.There's the iconic scene which is stunning of course but then it drags because there's nothing to do except follow police procedure. That is the laziest kind of story: just follow people whose job it is to investigate macabre things...But it does pull itself together by the end. The ending will really stay with you. It's just thoughtful.,6,0,4,21 March 2019
The Witch," It's professional and distinct enough to be worth your time.
","Above average period chiller with a vivid sense of place and time where a family is trapped on all sides by the elements.Not terribly accessible with its Jacobean dialogue (apparently its very authentic but I wouldn't know) and it almost gives the movie a comic tone but the substance shines through very disquietingly.There's none of the bluntness and obnoxiousness that you might get in movies like The Conjuring, where sudden blasts of strings ruin what might have been a good reveal.We just gradually find in god's country forces that appear to be unholy (see what I did there?), captured in an unrushed, flavoursome, culturally rich fashion.Maybe it drags in parts but overall this was refreshing, especially its folksy yet chill music that uses a variety of neat instruments and is a long way away from the blandly generic scores we're used to.",7,2,3,19 April 2019
Rosemary's Baby," As good as the book should have been.
","It's hard to put into words why this is just a swellerific feature.I don't want to sound snooty but a lot of this genre can seem a bit lacklustre. But this movie just seems to be made of some kind of golden stuff. Every moment oozes atmosphere, even when they're just chatting.Maybe its the lurid color of the semi-bourgeois inner city and reserved but decisive approach to camera work. It can seem a bit campy and grand guignel (I think I'm using that right) but that only helps its attempt to through you into a strange new world almost like our own.Dread builds and is intensified with a constant feeling of understatement and denial. Apparently the book is a lot more subtle but I felt that the approach in revealing the narrative was impeccable as the hidden darkness among the seemingly normal emerges.Vivid.Just an update: I read a review in Halliwell's that this movie is 'Good in a Heavy Handed way, the book being a lot more subtle'. Well, it's not actually that subtle, the movie I think is the better made even if it is sort of apples and oranges.",8,2,2,19 May 2019
When Harry Met Sally...," Seeing Carrie Fisher was my favourite thing in this.

The Holiday," If you like things that taste like diabetes then you'll love this.
",The epitome of sugar sweet festive movies.The two stories do not intertwine. They are just the right length and break each other up most obligingly.Diaz plays a business woman caught of guard by a widowed father (Jude Law at his most delicious). I'm allowed to say that even as a straight guy...Winslet gets a new lease of life befriending an ageing screen writer.Quite soapy at first but it finds itself and it will appeal to those who want something utterly inoffensive and feel good.Jack Black steals the show of course.You know this kind of movie; if you're a 'guy's guy'. you probably won't get much from it but your lover almost certainly will.,7,0,0,25 July 2019
War of the Worlds," Wells, Wells, Wells... what on earth is this?

Love Actually," A sort of facebook of Familiar british actors.
","Trite and saccharine festive anthology that loves the smell of its own excrement.Desperately to be the most glucose rich piece of festive crowd pleasing that it can be, Peter Griffin was right; Liam Neeson's story was the second weakest. The weakest one was that guy who loves his friend's fiancee (they get married to the Beatles' 'All you need is love'... this movie has no limits).Alan Rickman brings a touch of class in a relatively dark story that almost balances the thing out. Bill Nighy is sensational as an ageing rockstar and Stacey (of 'Gavin and...' fame), gets naked.The separate parts sort of make a swallowable whole somehow.But don't get your hopes up for this. You half to be in total romcom mode to enjoy this.",5,0,2,25 July 2019
Wedding Crashers," Crashed and burned.
","Pretty enjoyable for as long as it could coast on its premise: who doesn't want to have fun at the expense of strangers, try a new persona and end the night with some genital sex from one of those actresses who pays the rent by never having a no-nudity clause?But then it loses momentum and we are faced with a very different picture. No jokes exactly. Just embarrassing circumstances and dialogue that feels like the writers just thought the actors could make anything sound funny no matter how blunt or unsubtle it is.Pretty excruciating. The romantic interest is one dimensional and it's total insta-love. They poured on the schmaltz but invested no energy actually creating an interesting romance.It's weirdly fascinating for its tone and one wonders if with different handling we could have had an amazing dark dramedy if only it could think of a real theme beyond the idea that people who want to have sex for it's own sake being awful for some reason.I feel cheated.",4,1,3,28 July 2019
Ice Age," All the sequels are better.
","Even as 9 year old I found this kind of underwhelming.I was disapointed that the Squirel wasn't really part of it, he just breaks up the plot with some vintage style visual gags that really are the best part of the movie.There is a pleasant approach to backgrounds and settings where you really get a convincing sensation of a pretty snow turning into something deadly.But too much of the movie is this tiresome duo of the goofy sloth and the no nonsense mammoth. I struggle to get invested in them trying to save this human. He just seems like a nuisance. The Tiger trying to misdirect them only discover the magic of friendship is also unoriginal, contrived and frustrating.The moments of pathos are not earned, the slapstick humour is something out of a hundred forgettable cartoon shows and it baffles how many sequels this got.",4,1,3,25 April 2019

","I'm not sure how to explain this movie. But it's unforgettable.My dad told me how when he first saw it he had never laughed so hard at anything. The next time he saw it some years later he was deeply disturbed by it.it's a movie that does not play fair or gentle; it's an uncomfortable examination of a place where we send the people that allegedly have something wrong with them (and most probably do).Jack Nichols Lascivious performance of a guy who lives to rock the boat is caustic, hilarious and vivid.it's tempting to see it as a hymn to anti-authorianism but I can't help think I'm shortchanging the movie by doing that.An unlovely but excellently crafted feautre with so many moments that will stay with you. It has never been equalled in its unromantic power. I'm not sure I could sit through the final few scenes a second time.",8,1,1,24 April 2019
Downfall," I have literally never been more disturbed by a movie
",I hate it when people say some movie is scary 'because it could really happen'.I find that aesthetically displeasing. It seems so dull that that is the principle reason something stays with you rather than the artistic decisions it makes.I'm sure this movie is all very clever and well researched but a lot of that was lost on me. It's a pretty impacting depiction of a grandiose individual simply collapsing. I wonder if its legacy is in part people just jacking themselves off to Hitler being unhappy but it's technically very well made.What I want to focus on though is not Hitler but the Goebbles. Now I know basically what happened in that bunker. There were no twists or surprises for me. But the way it's done and the things they said...coupled with how it really happened made it finally pierce the skin and get into a raw nerve.I thought about the Goebbels everyday for a long time after seeing this movie. I couldn't stop.I intentionally seek the most disturbing movies I can find but I can genuinely say this is the only one I come close to regretting even seeing at all.I'm glad I've seen it because now I can move on from it.I've given a rating based on my general enjoyment of the rest of the movie. I might even be being a bit generous but even I can tell it was a movie that a lot of energy went into.Watch it by all means but just be prepared psychologically.,6,0,7,19 March 2019

The Conjuring," Everything wrong with modern horror.
","Why do people like this movie? I'm not trying to be snooty but it's crazy... I don't think there's a single other horror movie that I'd say is more over-rated.I watch a lot of this kind of movie and I'll be the first to admit that they can be a bit...repetitive (to put it nicely).I have a rule where I never watch a movie whose title is a gerund because they always seem to be terrible. But I lifted that rule for this because people kept telling me 'it's not like the other conveyor belt horror!'.Well, sorry to rain on your parade but it actually kind of is. I don't mind tropes. Tropes are tools. But this is one of the most derivative, generic horror movies I've ever seen. The cliches just keep on coming....evil smells bad... the dog knows... dark little cellars...and the most annoying of all: the paranormal investigators.To me horror is a fight between people and the unknown. But bringing in the experts and giving names to everything stops it being mysterious, stops it from truly being a horror and makes it a dark supernatural thriller. And that wouldn't be so bad by itself, but this seems so committed to being what it thinks horror is, it gets kind of annoying.It doesn't have gore, violence, sex or profanity. But so what? The issue with those kinds of movies was never that they were gory, or sexy or profanyey. it's that they coasted on it rather than actually put some effort in. This removes the gore and replaces it with...same old, same old. Thus it is worse than those other movies because it doesn't even have base pleasure to fall back on.I get that it could be pretty effective horror for someone who had never seen a horror movie before. I attribute the financial success of this movie to how it baited that section of the audience by including Annabel plus the promise of no gore to get the two-horror-movies-a-year crown into the theatre.I really don't believe that any type of incorporeal menace would spend any time mocking a human made religion. I don't get why they mess with this family rather than keep a low profile. The motivations of the antagonist just isn't convincing. I hate this movie's trite attempt to be poignant and about family.As a non-believer, I really have no problem with the supernatural in the horror genre, up to and including the mainstream religions. Hey, maybe I'm wrong! The possibility of my world view turned upside down is scary. But this makes no concessions, it feels more like a sermon than a good religious horror.Just an annoying movie. I will give it some credit for managing not to be too trashy and it does feel like there was real talent behind the camera.But ultimately it is not a departure from the generic horror movie. We need to depart from this.",2,0,3,11 March 2019
Prometheus," Chain this to the rock
","I haven't seen much of the Alien Franchise so I'm watching this with only a memory of 'Alien' in mind.I'm afraid if you're going into this eager for a visual stunning, intelectually stimulating piece of sci-fi action adventure drama you're going to be disappointed.Maybe the nuances of this movie will be more meaningful to someone more familiar with the franchise but I thought this whole thing was kind of derivative.Now i'm not a snob when it comes to these movies: I'm very willing to believe this kind of thing can be intelligently written and original while at the same time i am happy to have the usual formula of cool monsters, lazer fire and blood everywhere.We don't have much of a premise, all the characters are pretty bland and wooden and it takes a long time for anything to happen. i get the importance of building atmosphere but this gave me so little in the way of motivation or character beyond a few crude types I wasn't really invested in anyone or anything I was seeing.There's good production values of course; plenty of great sets and design but it's all more of what we've seen before. They do the 'classical music in space' cliche which I'd be fine with but it's...just guess...yes Chopin's Raindrop Prelude. Why is it always Chopin? This is emblematic of the level of originality this movie gives.We are almost halfway before anything really cool happens and the aliens of this movie are few and far between. The motivations of the antagonist are confusing to say the least.It's not very gripping, not very emotional nor does it give you much to think about except some nebulous ideas about hubris and immortality. it's dull. It took me three sittings to get through it. Maybe i should give it slack for being the first in a planned series and it's job is really just to lay groundwork for the sequel but that still is not a point in its favour.The ending deserves a better movie to have come before.",3,1,3,2 March 2019
Carrie," There isn't a movie quite like it.
","A rather campy and hysterical horror of a kind they wouldn't make now, probably for good reason.But the resulting uniqueness in its style makes it a strangely disquieting if unsubtle experience.It's hard not to fall in love with Jolie Laide, Carrie and the plot gives every clue we are going someplace terrible without getting macabre till toward the end.Not always dignified; Carries mother is a laugh and at one point they actually fast forward the footage.But it is enchanting and hypnotic. While James Wan shows us a monster and then has us trying to escape it as if it were a Spielberg Movie, this is post-tonal recount of an unfortunate situation that turned into a nightmare.",7,1,1,27 May 2019
The Woman in Black," It improves on the book but that was never to be hard.
","I'd been told this was a generic horror movie and I believed them. I read the book first and thought it was trash so I was curious about how they'd go about doing this.Now, despite indeed being somewhat generic, I thought it wasn't half bad in its first act. Yeah, it's old school horror; fog, old mansions, Edwardian clothing but I really dug that. It is a beautifully shot movie in a formidable, bleak yet oddly stirring landscape that doesn't get dull. I might have nitpicked some cinematographic choices but they weren't a big deal. The old, remote town with a secret that may or may not just be their old superstitions may be a cliche but it did build a sense of dread.Unfortunately, it gets REALLY generic mid way through. Bland, cheap scares and a Halloween costume of an antagonist (despite the build up and lore surrounding her, she herself has very little stage presence when she actually appears). This coupled with a really uninspired score that dampens a lot of potentially good moments by telegraphing to you when things are going down makes this movie ultimately a failure.It's still better than the book though. There's more of an actual plot rather than just chapter after chapter of one guy drawling over how scared he is. Arthur is so much more likeable and I can't imagine anyone other than Daniel Radcliff playing him with a stolid vulnerability that really helps shake away the spirit a certain boy who must not be named.I wouldn't bother unless you're curious how they handled the adaptation. I hear the play is a lot better. Ending was kind of a cop out too.",5,0,0,16 March 2019
Mary and Max," Once in a while, a movie just stays with you.
","Some movies are just special and a want to think carefully before I review them. I've known of this movie for ages without knowing any details. I'm always fascinated by animation that is neither the family movie idiom or its polar opposite (Like, you know, Family Guy of which I am actually a big fan).Describing this movie is hard, but that's partly because it's intelligence lies in the simplicity its idea, though this is not really a simple movie.It's tempting to say that it didn't need to be animated but a movie more than the logistics of its plot, this movie has a style and tonality all of its own which more than justifies the work needed to stop motion animate it like a vintage kids show as this movie embodies that part of all of us that still feels like a small child trying to understand a challenging world.Always visually compelling, the narrator is agreeable enough but I can't help but feel that they over use him; several times in the story we can see quite clearly how capable the movie is of conveying the narrative visually but the overall picture feels simply like an audiobook that happens to be elaborately illustrated as we see the hypotheticals, fantasies and fears of the characters as they describe them to each other. But since the narrative is all about a penpal correspondence and thus very internal, they can sort of get away with this more than the average movie could and very little of it is objectionable anyway.A grotesquely but still beautifully painted in muted colors and grotesquely charming (but usually just grotesque) visions of the human form that made me feel like I was witnessing the human race like an alien would; unbiased by any local standard of beauty. Mary's waddling walk and the cartoonish proportions of the characters combined with the stylized vision of the foreboding inner city and the stark antipodean suburbs give an effect that is at once naive and sophisticated somehow.it's a dark vision of a seemingly hopeless world. Everyone is ugly and destruction is everywhere, especially of the self. It gets so relentlessly unfortunate that it becomes comical and then bursts out the other side and becomes just dark again.I never knew what this movie would throw at me and I was figuratively brought to the edge of my seat at least once. The shameless use of scatological detail and crass jokes make this a movie that is not aspiring to any particular standard of beauty and the small lifeline at the centre of the picture of two individuals who despite everything found each is like nothing I've seen before in any artistic medium. It makes you feel like laughing, crying and low key recoiling and each turn leads seamlessly to the others.It's abuse of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra notwithstanding, this movie had me in tears and punches home with a remarkable honesty and humility that people are all basically broken and although I have a couple of objection to where ended up considering what this movie puts you though, I walked away from this with a greater capacity for empathy than when I begun it.",9,0,0,26 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," Trashy movie with one amazing character.
","There's one good thing about this movie and that is Hopkin's riveting performance as the inimitable Dr Lecture.The scenes with him in our one of those rare treats in the movies where everything in a character from their look to their voice and their lines makes you want to hang a poster of them in all the rooms of your home.It's the rest of the movie that palls. The flimsy plot they use as an excuse to get Lecter on screen focuses on some transsexual killer as its macguffin and this might have been somewhat interesting if this really was the story they were committed to tell and focus on. Like how even two really good pieces of music can sound jarring and stupid when played at the same time, the overall effect is of a disjointed movie that desperately required some rethinking of its plot direction. It's just goofy.Jodie Foster's stoney performance as copper as the overzealous fed typically shows about as much emotion as my toaster. She doesn't feel like a person, just some crude character type that is just boring to watch and impossible to feel anything for. When she does finally show emotion it's like a daytime movie and she manages to help realize what is perhaps the most obnoxious, smug and heavy handed monologue in all cinema. Whoever wrote this seems desperate to convince the world that women in the work place are all emotionally sterile, hard to like nitwits making this movie a huge middle finger to feminism even if its bad guy wasn't a man who wants to be a woman. Or woman trapped in a man's body, I'm not really fussed.There are so many moments where you really feel the classic this might have become but the movie it should have been is just a subplot. Make Lecter the protagonist, Clarice the antagonist and Bill just one of several killers uses and there's your movie.",4,1,6,18 April 2019
Win Win," Yes. This is what a generic movie is like.
","I thought this was going to be a comedy...This likeable, if rather nondescript drama fills its running time pretty well. It's characters are mostly well imagined and likeable (except the mother; she annoyed me).There's a comedic tone but they never let it distract from the substance. There's at least a couple of coincidences in its plot and it doesn't have the courtesy to really give the viewer what they want as it takes some predictable routes only to kind of end with its middle finger in our faces but it isn't half bad.A laconic youth manages to make something of himself through sport. So yes it's a sports movie which like any adequate sports movie isn't really about sport but what Stallone calls 'the journey'. It's nice enough to not climax with a fight but the distinctly less interesting plot line of the lawyer doing something necessary but apparently unscrupulous. The problem is that it's crucial to the plot that what this guy does is apparently so heinous but you kind of empathize.There's a cute child actor who is frankly a bit wasted but the talent all round is pretty admirable in handling a rather dry story with pathos and personality.The movie never tries to be a comedy like I said but even then isn't as funny as it thinks it is. ('Oh s$#!')Not memorable but I didn't feel like switching it off.",6,0,0,27 May 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," You know what to expect
",Basically the same experience that The Dark Knight gave us.It's all very impressive but again I must admit my main memory of it is numb buttocks.Could have stood to be about half an hour shorter.,7,0,4,3 January 2020
Mother!," I would rather watch the video for the Blondie song on loop for 2 hours than ever watch this again.
","How could they let this happen?Apparently a very polarizing movie. One side says it's dense and incoherent, the other that it's a lot more subtle and nuanced than it might appear on an obvious level.Something I keep hearing people say about certain movies is 'dafuq did I just watch?' And today I am one of them.While watching the end of this today (I began it over a week ago), I thought to myself that I would say something like 'one of those movies that's either super clever or complete trash with no inbetween' but no. I am not going to give this movie the satisfaction. If there is anything to admire in this movie's writing then it was so over my head that I have to strain my neck to see it.With so many generic, paint by number horrors/thrillers on the market it can be so nice to find something a bit different. Something audacious, something that defies easy categorization and targets the more patient viewers, not the ones that can't take anything different. Even if it isn't a resounding success that it tried to be something fresh will surely win it some points right? But the darker side of experimental art is that it can go so horribly wrong.I have no intelligent criticisms. This incoherent mess of inexplicable events with infrequent supernatural elements seemingly shoehorned in is simply too much. It feels like a parody without any sense of humor. At least 'Epic Movie' had some fun with itself. It's not even sort of fun in how campy and over the top it is, it's like a 2 hour music video without any memorable music. Apparently they used next to no music which I would admire normally since nothing seems to ruin an otherwise good horror than the over use of its score. But that was sadly wasted here.It keeps its cards close to its chest, but the situation drags on for so long on the same basic idea that you think this must be going somewhere toward some big twist or reveal. Some movies are daring and cool for keeping it mysterious but this just feels the writer kept a dream journal, cherry picked the stuff that sort of felt spooky and just slapped as close to plot as he could around it to cover his tracks, hoping that some of the audience would just assume it was deep. I want a deep movie, I'm not trying to hate on parallel cinema or the avant-garde, but we need to be wary of things that are so style over substance.I thought at one point maybe the reason I don't get this movie was because it was playing on a very feminine mentality. This wife and soon-to-be mother has married a poet admired by many and only wants to build a household to raise his kids and be near him. But she finds she won't be able to avoid sharing him with his followers as easily as she thought. Tons of visitors being bizarrely bad guests is this movie's favorite gag (or horror equivalent) and it gets old fast. I try to be the best feminist I can be, I get women and girls are just people like me but heteropatriarchal culture maybe gives them a perspective I can only obliquely appreciate. Though this was indeed written by a man I believe. But it can't be that. That only begs the question of...everything else.I sort of want to admire how it was almost disquieting inexplicable the whole thing is for its first two acts. You get a firm feeling there is something going on that people aren't talking about but it doesn't really work, I guess in part due to no groundwork or good characters.The movie begins with...well she's sort of on fire. And then there's some kind of house magic. This is a supernatural element but it almost feels like an afterthought. There is an excellent non-supernatural movie in here somewhere they didn't even try to chisel it out. Every marble masterpiece was once just nondescript marble in a chink of rock. And here, they've just left it in.Early on in the movie I was a bit distracted by how in-your-face the cinematography is. It's almost comical. Almost. I decided early on this movie was made of superior stuff. There was a pretty good atmosphere of quiet dread, or there would have been if they had had less artificial dialogue and better camerawork. Then people come to visit and...I can't even. They don't even try to justify it, it's like they got the wrong script at one point and started making a different movie and didn't edit it out.And the final act...this bizarre crescendo of craziness. It feels like a creepypasta but extra pretentious. They get so deep into it as a plot with the magical elements so well established that you expect to get some kind of explanation or resolve. But you do not. It seems to think its edgy and challenging but it's just lazily exploiting macabre and emotional tenderness.And finally Ms Lawrence: is she physically able to play a character in a way that doesn't make me want to punch her in the face? Every role she takes should have gone to Kristen Stewart. There, I said it. Bring on the dislikes, but I am sick of seeing her get all these roles. At least a better actor didn't have to get dragged down with this sickly, arrogant, over-ambitious yet poorly thought through, pseudo-intellectual mess.The possibility it could be an allegory, let alone one about genesis, never occurred to me. I must be that oblivious. But even if it is allegorical so what? What am I supposed to get out of that? Allegories can be so cool, like Animal Farm, but Animal Farm had a lot of pertinent points to make about freedom of expression and how there are more than two sides in political struggle. How do any parallels in this narrative with Genesis absolve it of anything? I already know genesis and even if it is a variation, it is a lazy variation. The mother is presumably meant to be some Gaia analogue because she's a fertile woman and is fixing a house. She doesn't 'give and give and give', is it even her name on the deed? Her husband isn't remotely god-like and if that's the point then why have him there? Is it a comment on the artificiality of religion, the heteropatriarchal biases of culture and how we mistreat our world? Well that's swell but when you're talking about feminism and environmentalism you need more nuance than 'they're really good things'. The check list of allusions to the bible aren't clever or or interesting, they just seem plagaristic. Literary allusions are cool but they need to be worked into a story that already has substance. The apparently motiveless destruction and abuse by the fans is shallow exactly because they are motiveless. Mr. Aronofsky has realised the delight of a parable: you can do whatever and just tell people its deeper than it looks, character motivation doesn't matter...It seems this movie is trying to tell us this: the world is in a bit of a mess, we are not treating the environment we live in well even though it is ultimately what sustains us and we are not learning from our mistakes.But that's the gist of a thousand elementary school assemblies across the world. And they at least got to the point without artificially stretching it to two hours. A 6 year old dressed in a paper mache planet Earth may not be the best actress but at least she's kind of adorable which makes her a lot more fun to watch than most of Lawrence's performances.I am quite convinced that this movie really had nothing new or pertinent to say; just a very loud way of saying it.",2,4,5,15 December 2019
Bruce Almighty," It's not god awful but it's not divinely inspired either.
",Very crude and rather stupid comedy that thinks it can get away with trashy humour because it pours on the sentimentality.And it sort of does. Amazing visual gags as Carey at his most cartoonish uses divine powers to get one over everyone who has wronged him make this worth seeing but maybe not with grandma.,7,0,0,23 June 2019
Monsters University," As good as the other one.
","A lot of people scoff at the tendency of Pixar at the time this was made to focus on things derivative of their previous works.I thought this was an enchanting return to a world of people are all kinds of shapes and species packed with neat visual gags and creatures stunningly imagined and realised with textures from feathered to glistening.The heart of the movie is a story of two individuals: one fighting to reach his dream against all odds and the other a legacy who's never had any reason to doubt their own potential. Circumstances compel them to overcome their initial dislike of each other and see eye to eye as they lead a band of losers to victory.The bulk of the plot may be trying to win that contest but it's a moving and well paced story that only touches with its depiction of long lasting friendship blossoming from a shaky start but also, rather than the usual 'follow your dreams' spiel, they actual confront the idea that sometimes your best just isn't good enough and you have to deal with that.",8,2,2,18 April 2019
Casino Royale," As anyone said they were 'stirred AND shaken' yet?
","I was never interested in Bond as a kid but when my parents took 13 year old me to this picture I can't say I wasn't impressed.This new serious Bond was really quite something: yes there were tuxedoes and gadgets galore but it captured something a lot more visceral, more masculine, more vulnerable.Danial Craig's new interpretation suggests an individual worn down by a post-imperialist government into a killing machine that still has some humanity left deep down and struggling (futilely) to get out.A lot of this movie is that card game and it does stretch the patience, as chic as the whole thing is. Certainly it overstays its welcome with a convoluted plot but that's not why we came anyway. Either way the set pieces are stunning, the script can be taken seriously and it will forever be on emblem to the harder Bond before we all got sick of Craig's face.",7,1,4,11 March 2020
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Still better than the first.
","Passable adventure that departs from the Ice age aesthetic and tries to be a bit more Jurassical and Vernesian.It works, it feels fresh, Manny's family drama doesn't improve it but this is a likeable adventure that never gets to any emotional intensity but for a very long saturday morning cartoon, it's not half bad.",6,1,1,19 August 2019

","Incredibly sugary, feel good movie with plenty of good intentions: real jerks getting their comeuppance, sweet pathos and a general celebration of life's small pleasures, this is about as accessible and inoffensive as it gets.A rich vision of Paris (like seeing the world distilled through a kaleidoscope) though never lurid and a lot agreeably stylized moments.Perfect first date movie or when you need some cheering up.",8,0,1,21 July 2019
The Producers," A bit of a diamond in the rough
","Retro in its style yet curiously modern in its tone, this is a professionally envisioned comedy with a great premise that allows us to see two masters of their craft glow off the screen: Gene Wilder's nervy accountant and Zero's rather faustian movie producer.Excellently paced, funny and actually quite unnerving (whether it meant to be is still not clear to me), there are problems with its plotting (they were very lazy in following through on the premise).",7,1,2,2 September 2019
Rear Window," Buy some binoculars before buying this movie.
","I saw this movie in my teens and I dare say I owe it a re-watch but I remember it as a slow and flaccid affair that doesn't do much with its theme of voyeurism.Instead it is just a straightforward thriller that could have been a neat twilight zone episode or certainly a good 20 minute film but is stretched way too thin with a romantic subplot just shoehorned in.I can't help but think he could have just ignored everything and been fine. The movie doesn't even explore the nature of his obsession, you just have to role with how he puts himself in peril even though he has a broken leg. I guess he's trying to be a conscientious citizen but he's not going to bring the wife back to life and it isn't worth putting an uxorcidal husband to justice if another person has to get killed in the process.People call it a classic and i don't like to think I'm unable to appreciate those but this is another one of those Hitchcocks where you get a lot of showy cinematography around a tepid, over-long story.It also has no atmosphere, the tone being more like a sitcom, making the moments of tenseness seem jarring rather than creepy.",4,0,3,15 January 2020
Godzilla," It's title should have been 'Godzilla vs...something'.
","Slow and lugubrious re-boot that unforgivably under-uses its best character.The monster mayhem is long awaited but admittedly pretty epic.But like too many disaster movies, there is too much time spent on bland humans. Either give your humans some charisma or just focus on what the audience came to see: zoological carnage!",6,0,2,5 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It was good in its day but do we really need it any more?
",It seems kind of redundant reviewing this movie but here goes.I think it's kind of dated. I'm not disputing how fresh it was at the time but for me the prequels just do the same thing but with better effects and less cheesily plus they had a bit more political nuance.People might tell you this movie has more depth or it has more heart but it really doesn't. It's just an adventure and that's fine but it's been superceded 100 times over.,5,1,9,21 March 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Viva la republica
","Obnoxious British flag waver (NB I am British too) that thinks it's a piece of youthful wish fulfilment as a little rascal becomes a spy and saves the world in the foot steps of his dad.What it really is is a propaganda piece about how you can American, posh or a nice person but never all three at once.With environmentalists (the bad kind) as the bad guys, the suggestion that every American is a god-bothering redneck and a real bias against anyone without a regional accent, this feels like it was made for people who vote for the UK Independence party.Explosive and actiony and with a certain pizzazz and humour that makes it almost feel like it could become a classic of ladish entertainment but it does not judge the balance of people I want to root for and characters to hate. It's all a bit...toxic. And I have a high tolerance of that kind of thing usually.There's this Swedish Princess that really annoys me. They think they're being naughty and fun but it's just excruciating.",4,0,2,4 August 2019
Cube," I liked most of it but the sequel is superior.
","A visually distinctive horror movie that creates an immediate and constant sense of danger without any of the useless filler we've become used to.Always technically fascinating with a lot of cool traps and ingenuity in its characters to try and survive while never loosing its menace because of it.There are a couple of hugely suspenseful sequences, I was holding my breath but you get a great pay off with the gore. It doesn't waste time with back story either.The flaw is the soapy drama that develops. A lot of yelling and bickering.Sequel is better.",6,1,1,6 March 2019
The Hangover Part III," More good fun. A bit more original than the second one.
","About as good as the first two.Here we mix up the formula a bit by it not actually being about a hang over but the boys' past coming back to haunt them.The same splendid hijinks (this time with an emphasis on Mr Wu), it may be a little predictable at times but the pacing, performances and humour are all as good as ever.It also rounds off the trilogy with a good message about growing up and remaining loyal to friends.",8,1,1,29 April 2019

","I saw this, I know I saw this, but I struggle to remember what this was exactly about.There's one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen for sure...two guys want her...there's a vampire council that's mad at them...The Charlotte's Web girl is in it I think...I did not hate this, I remember the movies I hate. But sometimes something is made not caring about the number of people who like it but the kind of people (Klimt said something similar). And this was made for the fans.My girl Kristen is great of course but even she can only do so much. At one point Bella says 'for now, I'm Switzerland' and that sums up the whole movie.

Click," It's actually one of Sandler's better movies.
",I know Adam Sandler sort of has a reputation and I wouldn't call him my king od comedy either but I quite liked this.There at least a couple of scenes I'd remove where stuff just gets plane gross or needlessly cruel but over all it's a positive experience.The Sandler type of humour takes a back seat to the plot. It's not an original premise but they handle it in a cool way. The first act is devoted to gags based on the numerous functions of the thing.But later it becomes what my dad called a sort of reverse 'it's a wonderful life' where he is shown the direction of where his life is going and how he doesn't have good prioritise. Or maybe A christmas carol. is a better comparison.I would say a fairly good experience with humour and pathos but not in a trite way.Henry Winkler's excellent too.,7,0,0,21 March 2019

Minions," Needed to exist.

The Cabin in the Woods," Skip to the climax.
",Generic horror movie with some kind of Office Space tribute interspersed in it.It's barely even a horror movie considering how upfront they are about everything. There is almost no mystery at all. The whole thing is rather adorable in how it seems to think it has something to say beyond 'these are horror tropes'.People keep mentioned a 'twist' but there isn't one. Just the answer to a mystery we had from the start.The whole thing is occupying enough and the climax is bad-ass but the ending is really annoying.,5,0,0,18 June 2020
Spectre," If you want another actiony no-brainer that thinks it's more grown-up than it really is then this will do.
","As expected we have everything we could want from this formula. It's explosive, stylish, sexy, machismo fun with a good bit of 'past coming back' seriousness thrown in for good measure. Even if the girl in this one is sterile and hard to like.The problem I have this movie is fundamental: it's redundant. Skyfall was the perfect Swan Song to the Craig era and now we have another one so it's hard to get excited about anything because I'm all a but 'been there, done that' about the whole thing. I'll always love a no-brainer action movie, but the time to move on is now. Sure it can be cool to be gritty but there comes a point where you're just too serious to be taken seriously and a new vision of Bond more willing to laugh at itself AND have some serious substance is something we're long overdue and that ruined me really finding this movie more than a modestly satisfying experience.Also, they tell you he goes rogue but it totally has no kind of build up or drama behind it, it just happens. I would have liked to see this disturbed icon of British Patriotism stand up again his bosses and lead the revolution for a moment but no.",6,0,5,23 September 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," Of course this won best picture...
","Solid, if sentamental little crowd pleaser that oozes so much exotic both the glamour and squalor that it sort of feels like an Indo-aryan Dickens novel with the same substance (NB I'm not that into Dickens).Fun enough and realized with vision and professionalism but that doesn't stop it being rather trite and over long.",7,0,1,9 September 2019
Donnie Darko," It's fine.
","Certainly an atmospheric, intriguing and diverting movie but I'm not sure I want to call it the masterpiece so many other people do.The fun is the mystery and every time we get close to solving it, it kind of deflates the tone.I think there is more to this movie that I picked up. How else could one explain the interactions between the family?Whatever it is ultimately about it is still that rare movie that is off the wall and bizarre without having its head up its own butt.I still wonder if they'd just toned it down and just played it as some kind of straight horror we might have had something better. More conventional, but horror is a genre where it's the details that make it.I feel it sort of went too far when those transparent tunnel things appeared.",7,1,1,31 January 2020

",An imaginative and compelling depiction of a sympathetic yet clearly damaged individual showing you don't need charisma to conquer the world.Obliquely about the tendency for us to want to be known yet guard ourselves but it's not preachy or sanctimonious about it.The tone is breezy and comedic and gets dark at just the right moments.,7,1,1,9 September 2019
Back to the Future," I'll always want to go back to this.
","Always delightful sciency yarn that has stood the test of time a lot better than most comedies from the same decade.I find being mostly set in a year before you are made really helps you in that field for some reason (just check out Kind Hearts and Coronets).A great, fast moving plot filled with Marty inventively navigating a minefield situation will be a delight again and again and one can't help but be rather fascinated with its audacious depiction of genetic sexual attraction. I'm not as into it as I suspect a lot of shirt haired students of gender studies are but I enjoy how much they probably enjoy it.Really feel good stuff that earns its status as feel good stuff and always visually pleasant. Don't take it too seriously and you won't regret giving this the time.",8,0,0,17 January 2020
The Proposal," Better than the average romantic comedy.
","Speaking as someone who doesn't have a lot of patience for romantic comedies (and certainly not for Sandra Bullock) I was surprised how charming I found this.I like the two main characters, he's easily flustered, she's taciturn, and seeing them fake a relationship in front of his family and the authorities was quite a good laugh.With only a small amount of suspension of disbelief I could believe the real romance that blossoms between them and really root for it.it's always refreshing to see emotionally closed women have their hearts melted by a man when we get the reverse so often...it's fun. If you're lover always drags you to see this kind of movie and you want to find something they will like that you will find tolerable, this one isn't a bad bet.",7,0,1,11 March 2019
Warm Bodies," Lovelorn of the Dead.
","Surprisingly competent mix of paranormal romance and rumination on the ambiguity of who really is your enemy or ally.Given the very internal nature of R's journey, it is more than justified we should get some voice over narration and it all works. This is an atmospheric piece of post-apocalyptic story telling with individual internal rules regarding its zombies and really adds something to an otherwise tired subgenre.It's a bit insta-lovey but it sort of tries to justify it in an interesting way. The worst thing about it sadly the immensely bland female lead.Our lead is much better. He's funny, cynical, sympathetic I can believe he's the kind of cute boy your daughter jerks it too and all the zombies here look brilliant.It's a sentimental story but never in a way it doesn't earn. A lot of people probably assumed this was a variation of 'Twilight' and although I don't hate that franchise, this is far more than the 'paranormal chick flick' I suspect a lot of boyfriends assumed it would when they were dragged to see it.Well, I'm a boy too and I saw it alone so no sexism intended.This movie is a sort of high 7 or low 8 so I think I'll round it up because it masters a certain charm we haven't really seen in teen movies for a while.",8,0,0,11 May 2020
The Birds," Excellent short film. Shame they made it feature length...
","This movie was based on a short story and it shows.They were able to make Brokebck mountain into a feature length movie but this was never meant to be more than a quick chiller.The infuriating amount of bland filler in this movie is a curiosity. Wooden characters and their bland lives that makes me glad something interesting actually came into them. I don't care if they die.A few excellent sequences notwithstanding, this is just an embarrassing excuse for a movie.",3,1,1,7 April 2019
Princess Mononoke," Looks amazing. At least it has that.
","I like to imagine, 10 year old me, in an alternative reality where the manga style of drawing didn't totally freak me out, catching this movie during some flight to a far away land and being swept away by its strange rhythms and formidable tone.In practice though, I saw this at 16 when I was a lot more jaded. This movie is a stunning clash of positive and negative aspects. It's basically blockbuster syndrome where the whole thing looks and sounds stunning but upon closer examination is pretty shallow.Basically everything about this movie is amazing but its script. Visually stunning with its lush setting coming up against the forces of modernity. The sparing but startling usage of CGI to represent the unholy. The mood, switching from epic battle of man and crazed demon to quite reflection as a stone gets speckled in rain. It ebbs and flows from peaceful to fiery that is hypnotic and compelling. The score will be your new guilty pleasure too.I've seen both the original and English dub. It was back at a time where I struggled to rarely take notice of voice performance when I was reading, but the English dub is fine. It's a mix of tolerable performances (like Mononoke and the main guy) plus some rather enchanting ones (the lascivious guy with the wart plusthe sultry english leader of the human forces).Now for the script: it's sort of different to have a protagonist caught between two sides, neither of which is fully in the wrong but this grey-lighter grey-white morality gets pretty sickly very quickly. I liked the apes and the Kodamas, they were all cool. But the message about the poisonous quality of hate was naive.The protagonist is a one dimensional mouth piece for the writer. He experiences no character development and barely expresses any emotion. He just stoically accepts that he's been banished and does so. He gets a little passionate when he gives grand sanctimonious lectures but they have little nuance beyond 'war is bad, environment is good'. I can totally get behind this on principle but it gives me nothing on how to put this into practice.The title character doesn't really do much. You know that kid in school that chastized you for eating meat? She's that. They try to sort of make them romantic interests but...I don't care about either of them.It ends more satisfyingly that its writers movies usually do. I got real sense of high stakes and conflict that wasn't resolved by easy answers.Frozen is a movie for all ages. This was a kids' movie.See it, but but expect a movie by a master animator, not a master storyteller.",6,3,5,22 March 2019
Jurassic Park," Fun enough movie
","I'd never seen anything from this series until 'World' was released so a friend of mine insisted we go to his house and watch the first one so we could see the new one together. It was on VHS, which was awesome, it was a fun experience because I saw it with a really good friend.The movie itself is plenty of fun. It already has a lot of it's appeal in its '90s feel, the whole of the '90s has a sort of muted, restrained quality to it in my memory. This is easy viewing for a weekday: it can seem perfunctory now as far as these adventure blockbusters go but it's quiant, stylish, well characterised and efficiently told. It's a great testimony to how one should use CGI effects but try to limit them things strictly impossible to other kinds of effects (I think people are calling them 'practical effects' now).So although it doesn't really shine compared to the new movies of this type, this is still quite worth your time as a delightful archetype of a genre I presume it gave a lot too.",7,0,0,15 March 2020
Alien: Covenant," I miss Sigouney Weaver's Butal cleavage so much...
","Autoplagaristic chore of a movie. It's just Prometheus again. One wonders if this movie's themes of creation and hubris could have been the basis for an amazing science fiction saga. But I just don't care about any of it. The characters don't feel like the characters in a movie but those in a videogame you get to neither play nor save from anything. They're just there.Perhaps to someone with a more refined palette this movie has a lot to say but even with all the nifty alien stuff and fancy technology, it's hard to stick with this movie for more than 20 minutes at a time. I literally did not pick up which one was Daniels until just before the end.Also, I didn't really get that David and Walter look alike either.The climax just feels a bit whatever about itself and despite all the expensiveness this movie oozes, I just struggle to get find any reason to care about it.Part of me is especially annoyed by the ending but I totally get why they're not making a sequel. Enough resources have been squandered on this misguided attempt to find in prequels what Stars did a thousand times better.I know this was kind of a passion project of Scott but for all his attention to detail he forgot the basic pleasures of story telling.At least the creatures and design is pretty fun.",3,1,3,18 June 2020
The Wizard of Oz," It's OK I guess
","How do you review this movie? It's like trying to describe your parents to a stranger: 'Oz is just...Oz'...It's so iconic and recognisable; it's a live action movie that kids watch that's over like 20 years old. I mean little kids, man...Who would admit this is their favourite movie? I know some people do but still...I can't think of a more low prestige and easily likeable movie.It's just old fashioned cutesiness, a formulaic plot, rich glucose rich visuals and catchy tunes all done with an amazing command of showmanship.Excellent make up and a rather terrifying villain (she goes so far into camp she busts out the other side and becomes terrifying again because you're not expecting it).The whole thing is a bit intellectually sterile but so is Star Wars IV and Schindler's list. The difference is I actually like this movie.Just a bit of fun and a whole lot of fun this bit of fun is.",8,0,4,20 August 2019
Dodgeball," Sometimes I just have no idea what to put as a heading.
","Very standard and typical teen comedy about adults. The underdog sports story is pretty watchable and the gags as usual are frequently juvenile but also frequently quite inventive though I have forgotten tons of details of this, though I do remember it was just fine.It's really just another feature in the familiar mode that will remind you of so many other things but really, it's fine if you're OK with that kind of thing. A casual watch when you just want to veg out.",6,0,0,15 March 2020
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," All fueled up but goes nowhere.
","I don't see how people call this a comedy. I'm not high brow with my humour but this doesn't even have any jokes, it just has schtick, meandering conversations and general vindictiveness as the plot follows the personal journey of several deeply unsympathetic people.I don't want something smart I just want an actual gag!One of those pictures best viewed in fits and starts now and again.",4,1,4,17 July 2019
