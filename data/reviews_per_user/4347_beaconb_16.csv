3:10 to Yuma," Finally, I like a movie the 'professional' reviewers liked!
","Wow! So nice to go to a movie and be totally entertained! I guess Hollywood has to do remakes of older movies to have a shot at putting out a good one these days. I never saw the original version of this one, but this version is fantastic! (I gave it a nine because ten should be considered virtually unattainable, to me anyway) The acting is excellent by all. There is action, humor, and a hint of 'romance' (a veiled sex scene, I guess some people consider that romance). I've only seen bits and pieces of Russell Crowe in other movies. He plays the part of the extremely evil villain, that somehow seems likable, excellently. There are even a few good messages this film presents, but I don't want to discuss them, because I would have to check the 'spoiler' box. The 'R' rating is pretty much just for a few profanities, and fairly graphic violence, but it is much tamer on the senses than the current crop of gross-out movies. I think children as young as 12 (at least boys) could handle this movie without creating haunting images in their minds that could last the rest of their lives (like I still have from some movies I saw when I was a young teen), since the violence is on par with many video games they have probably seen or played before. I would be surprised if anyone did not like this movie, unlike so many of the critics favorites, which I am tempted to walk out on most of the time.",9,0,1,27 September 2007
The Longest Yard," Waaaay better than the original!
","I saw this with my children and said, 'But the original is better'. One day the original was on TV, and we watched it; we couldn't watch it through to the end because it just dragged and lacked the humor of the remake! I'm watching it now, for about the 4th time, and I still laugh out loud at the one-liner jokes sprinkled througout, especially the Chris Rock lines! Don't let nostalgia spoil your opinion of this movie!",9,0,3,1 November 2019
Superbad," Just another gross-out R-rated 'comedy'
","I was hesitant to see this movie, because most reviews were reporting on its 'gross out' factor. However, I've seen other movies reported to be similar, and still managed to find them funny. This movie just wasn't that funny to me, and the chubby lead character, was simply disgusting on many fronts. I sincerely hope this movie was very distant from the reality of high school kids today, or this country is lost! The funniest characters in the movie, the cops, were basically rip offs of Reno 911 characters. Once again, the general praise of this movie by the critics misled me. I was similarly fooled by the praise of Napolean Dynamite. I need to find a movie critic who couldn't stand either of these films; then I might be able to use them as a reasonable indicator of a movie I might like. I wish movie ratings could be sorted according to the age of the viewer. I suspect that as the viewer age increases, the rating of movies like this goes down.",2,3,8,3 September 2009
The Expendables," Worst movie I have seen in years!
","I didn't give this a '1' because it at least didn't include the depravity of so many movies these days. But that is the only positive thing about this monstrosity! It featured horrible acting, horrible dialog, and a pretty ridiculous plot. This was truly a case of me wanting those two hours of my life back! How anyone could seriously rank this load of crap as better than a 7 may be biggest mystery of the universe! I assume 10's are posted by people associated with the movies, because a movie worthy of a '10' come along so rarely. '10' is supposed to mean perfect people! How could anyone think this is a perfect movie? (how can 99% of all movies be considered perfect?) But the fact that so many ranked it as a '9' has me wondering if civilization has officially come to an end.",2,4,8,27 February 2012
Little Miss Sunshine," One of the top 10 movies I have ever seen
","I was somewhat reluctant to see this movie, because the movie critics almost unanimously raved about it. My past experience is that if the critics love it, I likely won't. However, when I saw that ordinary people also loved it, I decided to go. I am so happy I did! It really did 'take me through all the emotions', well, not all, but it brought laughter and tears, and that's a pretty good combination. As wacky as some things in the movie may seem, it is not too wacky to be unbelievable. The acting is excellent and the only fault I have with it is the abundant use of the 'F' word, which could have been bleeped in places, and substituted for another word in other places, without losing the 'effect' I guess they wanted to achieve by having the 'F' word in the movie. That was the only reason the movie was rated R, so they could have easily made it a PG-13 movie, although it is the kind of movie that may not appeal to many under 18 anyway. The characters are all so good, I hope they figure out a way to make a sequel, without making a sequel just to cash-in on. I don't pay attention to Oscars, but this movie better get some nominations for a few categories.",10,3,8,13 September 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Surprisingly humorous!
","I watched this again after not seeing it in several years, and I haven't laughed so much in a long time! I think the jokes that are strewn throughout the movie are missed when you first watch it, and maybe even a second time. I'm not sure why the average rating of this was so low. I thought the plot was 'believable', the acting good (with Arnold being Arnold, of course), and of course, the action and special effects were fantastic. Many of the jokes require familiarity with T2, so perhaps that is why people may have rated it lower, because without the humor, I would drop my 9 to a 7 or 8. I would recommend watching T2 again, and then watching T3, and see if your opinion of T3 goes up.",9,1,1,20 January 2019
District 9," A great all-around movie
","I read the mixed reviews, although mostly very positive, and wasn't sure what to expect. Perhaps it was because I didn't have any expectations that I really liked this movie. Having no actors that I've ever seen was also a definite plus, because I didn't know what might happen to them, or when. The acting was excellent and the overall look of the movie was fantastic! The combination of pseudo-documentary, and conventional film, was very effective. I expect that this movie will be a top-ten at the box office for many, many weeks, since word-of-mouth is probably what brings people to see it. It's so nice to know that people are still willing to make an original movie, as opposed to an 8th sequel, or even worse, a third re-make.",9,4,8,3 September 2009
I Am Legend," Not Worth the Price of Admission
","I saw this last night and was looking forward to seeing it because I had read some positive reviews about it, and the TV trailers looked pretty good (Yes, I know that's their purpose; to get you to see a movie regardless of how bad it may be). This is one of the few times where I agree with a lot of the 'professional' critics; it just wasn't very good. I believe it could have been presented in about 45 minutes. The pacing was agonizingly slow. The 'scares' were just basic 'gotcha' type moments. Not much character development, and all around, just not worth the ticket price. I guess I'm not surprised it did well the first weekend, but I doubt it will sustain high attendance, because I think word of mouth will kill it. (I can't believe the average rating is so high on here!)",4,7,13,20 December 2007
Gran Torino," As Mr. Burns would say, 'Excellent!' (and not really a spoiler review, but I don't want to be blacklisted)
","I give this movie a 9, only because, as some other posters have noted, there are a few deficiencies in acting. But Clint carries the movie, so it is easy enough to overlook any other problems with it. It is so nice to see a movie that appeals to adults like myself (I'm 52). I get so mad at the R-rated comedies that I keep vowing never to see one again. This movie is R-rated only for the profanity, and as such, could easily be seen by anyone over the age of 10 (because they will have already heard all the words in school). What is nice about seeing a movie like this in a crowded theater (my wife and I had to sit almost in the front of the theater because we got there right before it started) is you get the mass laughs and other responses. There are PLENTY of laughs in this movie! The racist lead character is funny to view, because we have all probably known someone like him in our past; usually it's not mean-spirited, just ignorant. Clint's character's ignorance is corrected as the movie progresses, and at the end, unless you are as cold-hearted as he appears to be at the start, you will cry! This is a great movie because it tells a great story, and has a pretty good lesson. It reminded me a little of the Paul Newman movie, 'Nobody's Fool' (a movie, which unfortunately was forced to be R-rated by the producers by a stupid quick nude scene, because they didn't think G-rated movies made money) This movie pretty much had to have the profanity (unless they bleeped it out, which I guess would seem awkward) to reflect some of the low-life characters who abound these days. That is the only caution I would see for children, is that they would get a false impression of how most people talk to each other by viewing this film. All around though, well worth seeing.",9,1,4,23 January 2009
Taken," Highly entertaining movie!
","I really enjoyed this movie! It's as if Jason Bourne got married, had a daughter, and had to rescue her when he's middle-aged. I'm a father of an 18-yr-old daughter, so I can relate a little bit about wanting to protect a daughter and rescue her if necessary. All of the acting was excellent, and I thought the plot was believable, even if the odds of everything happening as shown, and the end result being what it was, was very slim (some would say not believable, but it's a movie, come on!). What was particularly refreshing is that the language was closer to what I believe to be how most civilized people talk, rather than the F-word fests of most movies these days. Sure, a few profanities here and there, but when people are getting shot and such, that's probably expected. One result of anyone seeing this movie; they aren't going to be letting their teenage daughter go on any foreign (non U.S.) vacation!",9,0,3,4 February 2009
Up," Too good to be true!
","I saw this with my family at the 'dollar' theater a couple of days ago (actually the '2 dollar' theater now) Although no movie is perfect, I ranked this a 10 because I couldn't find anything wrong with it. In fact, I believe it is the best movie I have seen in the past couple of years! It is hard to believe that a few minutes of animation can make you cry! The humor is excellent as well, and of course, doesn't rely on the raunchiness of the R-rated comedies to get laughs. There are a lot of great messages in this movie that have probably already been discussed by others, so I won't get into it, but you do come away with a little better understanding of what is important in life. What is nice is that the messages are not left or right, politically speaking, but just plain human!",10,1,3,9 November 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Depiction of Depravity
","I would have given it a '1', but there were some funny lines.Based on this movie, and others by Quentin Tarantino (probably spelled incorrectly), I think he should be thrown in prison for being a marketer of immoral depravity. Looking past the poor cinematography, it's just a story about lowlife crooks. I felt like I wasted 90 minutes of my life. I would have left earlier, but I kept thinking 'maybe it will turn around before the end'. I went on to be mad I didn't leave earlier. The only saving grace is that the theater charged only $7, compared to the normal $12 (that's right, now it's $12 to see a movie in Manhattan), since it was not a new release. This movie once again convinced me that it will be VERY difficult for me to ever like an R-rated movie. I don't mind violence, when it's a good guy, or guys, getting the bad guys, but this was almost all bad guys. Don't waste your time.",2,4,12,12 March 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," Nobody to really care about
","I had a co-worker raving about this movie for weeks. I had heard it was essentially porn with a story, but for lack of better judgment, I watched it (and should have quit after the first 10 minutes; I want the 3 hours of my life back!). This movie should have been 90 minutes, not 3 hours plus! (just removing the F-bombs would have cut it down to 2 hours ;) ) There needed to be an editor for this sleaze-fest! There were some funny lines/scenes, which is the only reason I didn't rate it 1. Scorsese seems to like to portray people who have no redeeming qualities (like the boxer in Raging Bull), and seems to have a habit of dragging his movies out way too long! If you are into porn, drugs, and profanity, you will love this movie!",4,2,3,13 February 2015
Raging Bull," Depressing and mostly non-entertaining
","I saw this at the Bardovan Opera House, in Poughkeepsie, NY, this past weekend (February 2007). I guess this is considered a great film by a lot of people, but I didn't enjoy watching a waste of human life for 2 hours. There were no characters of any redeeming value in the entire film! These people were a bunch of morally bankrupt lowlifes! And I sincerely doubt that anyone used the F-word in the 1940s as much as was featured in this film. What is it about so many movie makers that makes them think inclusion of the F-word somehow improves it? (just like so many standup comics of today) And the whole B&W thing! Just because color film is the norm doesn't mean making a movie in B&W somehow moves it out of the 'movie' category and into the 'film' category. The pretentiousness of Hollywood really makes me sick sometimes! I will take 'Rocky' (just about any one of the series) over this movie any day of the week.",5,11,24,5 February 2007
Casino Royale," Excellent new direction for Bond films
","I had seen the great reviews of the new Bond film and decided to check it out. It was well worth it. It was a mostly believable plot, the acting was mostly excellent, and I hope to see more like it in the future. There were some humorous parts, but subtle (I was the only person laughing at some of the jokes. One has a quick view of Richard Branson in an airport security screening. I guess I was the only person in the audience that recognized him, and the humor of it). As a hold'em poker player, I was a little disappointed in the hand they used to show Bond losing to what he perceived as a bluff (if you have a full-house, you aren't going to be too concerned with someone having four of a kind, so worrying about whether they are bluffing is not an issue).",9,1,3,21 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Arguably as good as the first!
","Let's face it. The 2nd Die Hard tried to be a typical sequel; it wasn't bad, but wasn't that great. The 3rd was a step below that. This sequel didn't feel like a sequel, other than the character being the same. This played more like a buddy movie and had a lot more laughs than previous versions. One final note, if you haven't seen the one that came after this, the one in Russia, don't bother!",9,3,5,28 May 2017
