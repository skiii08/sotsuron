The Sound of Music," I LOVE THE SOUND OF MUSIC
","I can not remember how many times I have seen this beautiful movie just as I can not count the number of my students. I showed it to my students whenever I had the chance and everyone was happy with it.  I asked my students to write about it after seeing the movie and some wrote with emotions. We love the title of the movie and we love the music of it. We love the songs Maria sang and songs sung by other people in the movie.We love the seven children of the captain and we love...everything it presented.I taught my son and niece and my nephew the song Doe-Ray-Me when they were only 2 years of age. I taught my new students Edelweiss the first time I met them and they sang it in their dreams (they got to like me because of this song!) I taught every song in the movie which I can sing. I will do that so long as I am still able to teach. It is so inspiring, so instructive,telling the audience what to love what to hate. For non-native English speakers, it is film that can bring motivation and desire to learn the language well. It is more than a movie.I found my own love with the songs in THE SOUND OF MUSIC. In 1986 a new teacher came to borrow the song book in which she found the song,the title of which I can not tell(the song words go like this: You are 16 going on 17...). She fell in love with the song and later with me. We were married one year later. And our son sings this song the best in his class.All I can say is that I love THE SOUND OF MUSIC.",10,3,10,27 March 1999
