The King's Speech," Is there already a contender for the best film of 2011?
","Marla, Darcy, Captain Barbossa, even Dumbledore. Not the type of portrayal and mixture of past roles that could make you believe The King's Speech is anything shy of fantastic casting. Braving these performances, helm the Oscar potentials Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter; particularly the foremost whose equilibrium of the frustration and determination never wavers.As well as presenting the daunting public speaking story arch of Albert's stutter, there's the more demoralizing dilemma of not being able to tell his children a story without the uphill effort to maintain his casualness.These aren't remedied by a drab series of music maimed sessions to ease this problem that lead to an unsatisfying voila; throughout all the exertion it takes him there's a very discrete pendent that dangles a thoughtful what-we-take-for-granted moral without taking it to full blown bluntness.Firth defines George VI as less of a standard cardboard cut-out King (take note dimensionless Eric Bana in the granny friendly mediocrity of The Other Boleyn Girl) just through his impediment frequently getting the better of him. In one scene, to great humour, his anger is exerted to a more profanity filled outcome which won't be spoiled as to be savoured but won't be hard to spot. Just one of Lionel's perverse methods, that effectively contrasts to the heroic struggle of man vs. stutter.Modelled to integrity, grandeur and supreme casting, The King's Speech boasts quite possibly the year best (and earliest) film.",8,1,5,9 January 2011
Black Swan," Billy Elliot eat your heart out.
","Signature of Afronofsky is his sublime yet controversial camera condensation of total self sacrifice in another masterful, more horror orientated sporting output. Settling on the other end of The Wrestler's steroid pumping, muscle bulging, manly man's movie is the delicate, tender perfectionist Nina; who through a series psychological and wince worthy moments drowns in the less angelic, antonym of her former self. Ambivalence really doesn't get better than this.The gruelling consummation process of her ordeal is much like Afronofsky's technique. Buy into it and you'll have joined the elemental delight his devotee's bask in, or else it's a sink or swim experience that only leads one other way. Tragically it can still feel something of an experiment to his most assertive fans, when its tendency to become carried away with the visual metaphor feels like a flawed burden in contrast to the head scratchers that dominate and support the majority of the film.Not acrimonious enough to contend as an equivalent to the malevolent bitterness of Nina's predecessor Beth (a vicious comeback for Winona) but gathers frustration in the boycotting of narrowly missed perfection. What is, without a nail splitting pirouette of a doubt, isn't Natalie Portman's circumventing of a sickly sweet scarlet ballerina image (undeniably helpful though) but the gradual shattering of her once pure demeanour to raw, savage precision, devoid of imperfect acting.She fits into the rare category of actually being born to play a role, uproar hopefully would persist a minimal Oscar nomination if that is what would subsist, because frankly had she faulted just one scene the entire film could have swan dived its way out of brilliance. A film of the year, no. A performance of the year, you can bet your tutu.",8,1,3,26 January 2011
Sucker Punch," Defending the misunderstood film that is Sucker Punch.
","What is likely to be the most underrated movie experience of the year, Zack Snyder's barrage of girls, gun and giant samurai is a misunderstood effort from the man behind 2009's excellent adaptation of Watchmen. Yes it's not without flaws, yes it can be predictable (especially the '5th item') but it doesn't mean that it isn't everything that most films seem to miss these days: fun. Fun isn't usually associated with child abuse and an asylum but that is where the curtain opens the audience at. An opening silence gives great anticipation, a tragedy occurs and protagonist Baby Doll is shunted into an asylum by her step-father, where she awaits lobotomy in five days' time. It should be said at this point that this review is coming from someone who openly loathes the style over substance limbo of an era in which we live, what with CGI and 3D being used as an excuse for anything considered a showcase for this technology.Sucker Punch boasted a similar exercise course of stylish nonsense yet the finished result left this reviewer in a state of pleasant surprise; the concept was highly original – though sprinkled with an influx of other influences which ultimately could have been the films downfall had the context they been used in feel more of a parody than a series of dream sequences. Orcs, dragons and robots have never been more refreshing out of their native genres.As the visuals go, there was never going to be an issue there. It's easily Snyder's best looking film to date, and for a written debut the plot is on par with the heavily –action orientated 300 in that it takes a back seat once the films' issue has been established. It's only noticeable dent in its armour is the characterisation, or rather lack of characterisation. For a film nearing the two hour mark the audience are relatively unrewarded when trying to relate to any of the five heroines' of the story. It may be great to see that Baby Doll, Blondie, Sweet Pea, Amber and Rocket haven't been assigned to overused archetypes – that would be taking the easy route, yet there's not even been a road taken here. The characters as such remain relatively hollow, being left as shell-less, albeit undeniably attractive characters. There's not even, what you could coin as a 'Fenster' wherein a character with next to nothing about them can morph into something noticeable, even memorable. They are what could be the fully-fledged realisation Pulp Fiction's Fox Force Five, each an assassin with their own weapon speciality; perhaps this is how the audience is supposed interpret their personalities, each instrument being reflective of the character using it. That is my only complaint, everything else did, as Big Daddy put it: 'Knock(ed) me for a loop', with three particular, but unspoiled scenes, breaking a monotony that had infected the infinite amount brainless action films that have preceded Sucker Punch – and sadly continue to follow after it. While the scenes aren't anything ground-breaking they play to Zack's strengths – detaching from the action so it does not cease to stand impressive next time round and focusing on the realism that confronts them back in the reality. Critics have mauled it, calling it 'dull', 'senseless' and even 'plot less' yet the fact many fans have interpreted it as having meanings on a deeper level, particularly the importance of Sweet Pea's character, suggests there may have been a certain naivety from critics - a definite contribution to its growing cult status (there is an excellent interpretation on the IMDb Message Board that is worth a look). You could also throw weapon argument mentioned above into the mix for further evidence of such ignorance - I also stand guilty of missing this possibility.The film has also been accused of being overtly sexist, but drawing another parallel to 300, 300 men are seen topless and not a single complaint is raised. But five scantily-clad women and one imaginary brothel are seen and all hell has broken loose. 300 got a reasonable 60% on Rotten Tomatoes and Sucker Punch just 22%; both are relatively balanced in terms of their stories, character's and direction yet the reception of each is hugely unbalanced. It effectively asks who the sexist ones really are.Sucker Punch is misunderstood, not question about it. It's not the genre changing cult films that Blade Runner or Donnie Darko are, but it certainly deserves the fans that it has generated and I for one eagerly anticipate the Extended Cut to see what else it has to offer.",8,45,71,21 July 2011
Memento," Raey eht fo eivom. Well it should have been.
","Apologies to the people who haven't yet seen this film and wanted to know what on earth the title of this review meant, but even saying might give away the slightest detail of the film. Well, it's unlikely you won't be able to work it out but try to appreciate the difficulty.Doing a review for this and not spoiling it is about as safe as playing hop scotch on a mine field; but if you won't get too upset about knowing the gist of the film then continue reading now.A guy has bad memory. Tries to find wife's killer. Leaves himself messages. Simple really. No of course it isn't and as if him having a bad memory and constantly repeating himself is difficult enough, the story is told backwards while another story of the same person plays chronologically forward until the two finally meet.And to add to the pressure of your head possibly exploding with confusion and high expectations (it is 27th on IMDb), fear not. The Dark Knight Director Christopher Nolan is at helm, along with Guy Pearce and support from Carrie-Anne Moss - try to forget the fact she was in two of the most disappointing sequels ever.All of them make this fall nothing short of sheer genius, despite not having any knockout performances. However that doesn't mean Guy Pearce isn't convincing as the poor chappy suffering anterograde amnesia (thank you Wikipedia). He deserved a lot more credit for playing such a difficult role without making the lead seem irritating or unbelievable.Ending on a sad note, unless it is watched on a yearly basis it probably won't be the chin-scratcher it was when you first ever saw it, so do make the most of it even if means you have scream at a feather dropping because it interrupted your viewing.",10,0,3,19 May 2010
Iron Man 2," Tony Stark still has the Spark
","The waiting and wondering have finally paid off. It's here, and handsomely boasts a cast ready to do justice to the unforeseen successor that is Iron Man.Tony Stark - quirky Downey Jr. who makes the role seem unplayable by anyone else, is full of his usual cocky charisma in this second outing along with the return of Pepper Pots and Rhodey whose character is welcomely replaced by Don Cheadle, who as fans will know by the trailer, gets his fair share of action in this sequel.Set straight after the memorable ending of Iron Man, numero two doesn't hesitate to have a crazy Russian plotting to end dear Tony's life within the first few minutes. Which isn't at all helped by jealous weapons specialist Hammer played by Sam Rockwell, who proves to be a dangerous foe indeed. At least like most people Tony can always depend on a one eyed Samuel L Jackson or a silver sidekick to help him out in these tough times.Thankfully director Jon Favreau hasn't made the same mistake Michael Bay and Co. did with Transformers 2 by trying to build on the same ideas as the original and add so many characters you forget what film you are watching. But that doesn't mean Iron Man 2 is without its flaws.The main downside - like almost every sequel made, is the story and characters don't seem to have half the impact they had the first time round and you find yourself praying the film will start to be everything you ever hoped for. With the finished result feeling like an unassembled but still quite appealing mess. And since the first Iron Man had such success you'd think it might have easily been one of the rare exceptions. Still, if it is like the first one this will definitely be a film that grows on you the more you watch it.Now since that proved very 'I'm not persuaded to watch this yet.' let's compensate by the fact that there is still plenty of fun to be found as well as lots of action sequences in this sequel; Whiplash (Rourke)'s sequence in particular will probably put off anyone hoping to be Formula One drivers for life, but it's often these most barmy scene's that make you forget about why the plot is so simple.To not leave any readers of this review feeling too heartbroken; the following four words are likely to seal the deal for any man/lesbian to still feel up to watching this, which they should since this is far from terrible. Scarlett. Johansson. In. Leather. Tissues recommended for uncontrollable drooling.",6,6,15,30 April 2010
Terminator Salvation," Definite improvement on 3, but please don't make a Saw series out of it.
","Picking up from the scrap metal inspired dregs of its predecessor, which left a bitter aftertaste, Salvation is grantable of being a vast step up from that. As a 4th instalment though, it is the Indiana Jones of 2009. Not being tragic enough to be a Shakespeare play (like the latter's abysmal finale), or the zesty jumpstart sought after, which at least ditches the shackles of its formulaic overtone that lost its voice after 3.Migrating the series to the less traditional, but frequently seen apocalypse of 2018 the man vs. machines battle wages on with John Connor (welcomingly replaced by Christian Bale) being the core source of hope, basically replicating the whole Zion affray and Neo worship with several tweaks.McG has done well for himself, showing he's more than just a fan who wanted to direct (direction in Charlie's Angels = near nought), but someone who understands the origins of the series that were mentioned in 1 and 2, like the Clone Wars were in Star Wars.Now it seems the laser beams, crumbling architecture and global deterioration have been revamped for a more modern age though still maintaining some of the essence Cameron introduced to the audience briefly in his future depiction. It doesn't produce the unwanted runt of a litter that could have been an Emmerich and Bay combined mishap, but borrows heavily from others and coats 99% of film in CGI; making it as humane as its metal protagonists.Carpet swept fakeries alike, it suits the film greatly and while it priorities visuals more than script it vastly boosts better all-round performances. If it bartered with emotions more then it might have been the offspring fans hoped for, but Terminator was never about sentiment was it?",6,0,3,27 December 2010
The Prestige," One of Nolan's and Bale's most prestigious films which proves gripping and enthralling
","If any director could make a film about two rival magicians who compete for a few tricks to bedazzle against each other at every prospect, then Christopher Nolan has definitely proved the man for the job. His almost trademark nonlinear narrative structure is as far from hackneyed as Christian Bale is having an angry outburst at the director of photography on a film (oops sorry about that Christian).Robert and Alfred - Bale and Jackman are two manic, manipulative magicians (like what I did with the m's there?) whose obsession with trickery and determination to be the best of the best plays a huge motivation for The Prestige. And it is all cleverly manifests by all the intervening past scenes that show how the smallest details became significant to the present day plot where our story begins; but by present day I mean early 20th century.So with these flashbacks you can expect plenty of 'Ahhhh I see how they did that' moments and a plot with so many layers it will match your homemade birthday cake. But Nolan can't receive all the credit for what makes this film so riveting. The rivalry between Bale and Jackman is intense and real sense of history and abhorrence is among them, so much so that it feels like World War three could break out at any moment. Scarlett Johansson though slightly underused for such a talented actress provides numerous ardent scenes between the main leads and shows she isn't just someone to ogle at in a corset - no complaints about that though.On this form Nolan's Inception should be a blast which The Prestige will no doubt wet your appetite for and give you a reason to watch over and over again not that one is needed anyway.",10,0,3,24 February 2010
Alien," A remarkable film that is both unique and not simultaneously.
","It's a given that with the collaboration of Ridley Scott, Sigourney Weaver and a rare blend of sci-fi and horror that brilliance was always going to be the outcome. Unless the scripting was deceivably dim-witted but good enough to hoodwink the likes of the previously mentioned talent, not to mention all the other cast members on board, there was always success on the horizon.Too known to be cult, too expensive to be a b-movie bombshell but it didn't drown in the stream of mainstream madness either. It's a film that has strong devotees, but a widespread reputation and overall loyalty. The obvious answer to how they swindled the box office success would be down to sheer talent and a ridiculously brilliant summary of the film all within the tagline.But it's more the premise for the whole scenario. A shadow friendly monster killing people off one by one, hardly the excitable reaction one would receive when summarising true originality such as Memento to the board. But because of an isolated setting, in an isolated vehicle, the inevitable becomes the inconceivable and that is (arguably) why this sci-fi horror can still manage to scare.Who on earth (or more accurately floating around space) wouldn't be scared of being trapped in a self destructing ship with a highly tactful, two mouthed carnivore on the loose? Asking yourself questions like this make you appreciate it is Ripley doing the running and sweating and not you.And you'd think with the fact it's the most horror fitting idea, to ever be thrown around, it wouldn't make you any less concerned for her well being just because its become a contemporary formulae that been fiddled with all to often. As far as scaring goes, it surpasses the interesting but un-scary original Texas Chainsaw Massacre with flying colours. As for science fiction? Its not 2001: A Space Odyssey but lets face what is? A remarkable film that is both unique and not simultaneously.",10,1,3,17 November 2010
Taxi Driver," As dark and depressing as Se7en, But also as brilliant.
","Travis (De Niro) is always something of a question mark from when we first meet him. He's never predictable in motivation, conversation or deliberation. An intriguing and brilliant character, who'll make you feel like you have the wood to be lit but he'd rather sit there and watch you shiver.Ironically though this character makes you feel this way through his stony silences - often filled with a narration of thoughts; he detests the filth and scum and deterioration of the city he serves faithfully. An almost pre-Rorschach figure in the smoky mist, or the modern 'goodie' who fights fire with fire in a city full of conflicting flames.Despite meeting Travis in this uncharismatic surrounding it's characters such as Cybill (Foster) who he meets while gazing in his flamboyantly obvious vehicle, that indicate the real people who need saving, not just the city itself. Controversial though her character (or more precisely her age) may be for such an unheard of role (again for the age) it doesn't take a historian to realise with bad times, comes bad professions and the wrong types of people in those professions.The blunt but accurate deterioration of a society, so lost in its bad reputation doesn't make this Scorsese's best. Sadly. Goodfellas proved much more, with much more style that wasn't all thanks to the direction and the lead actor. Second best? Absolutely.",10,0,0,29 October 2010
Shutter Island," DiCaprio and Scorsese prove a incredulous duo yet again.
","Having only seen one of the double acts now a total of four collaborations (The Aviator) the pressure was certainly on for DiCaprio and Scorsese to produce another masterpiece that exceeded their previous work in any and every way possible to prove they were still as capable as ever since their first outing in 'Gangs of New York'.Shutter Island which is arguable Scorsese's most chilling film to date despite being labelled as a psychological mystery-thriller is a clear monument to one of the greatest directors around that he is as close to his celebrated status as he is in his synchronized partnership with DiCaprio.Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) is a U.S. Marshal whom with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) investigates the disapearance of a mentally ill patient from the island, which unfortunately proves a giant emotional and physical effort for poor Ted. If he isn't being haunted by his dead wife in his dreams then he's pulling at strings about trying to work out how a patient escaped a locked cell with no shoes. Bummer eh? But as expected one mystery leads to another then another giving this more twists than a Curly Whirly and plot that leaves you forever guessing the unguessable. So as you can imagine the ending is an indulgence that's both immensely satisfying and one in keeping with the surprise element of plot shocks and the shocks guaranteed to scare.",8,1,3,19 March 2010
Lost in Translation," Lost in Lost in Translation
","In life there are lots of people who you see in the movies. No I'm not saying Darth Vader gave me a high five this morning or E.T. waved merrily at me on his bicycle. I mean real people. The ones who are lonely, unhappily married, need friendship or else stuck doing a whiskey commercial but would rather do plays.Okay that is a bit too specific. But luckily Bob Harris (Bill Murray) from Lost in Translation fits this description perfectly. He, as you might have guessed, is doing a whiskey commercial in Tokyo for $2 million. And other than giving Mickey Rourke's usual film characters a run for their money for the high amount of alcohol being consumed throughout the film, Bob is a relatively lonely chappy.That is until the lucky devil meets Charlotte (if you know who plays her you'll understand why I called him that). And the two form an unlikely friendship; giving it the adventurous feel of an older aged / modern day version of Hansel & Gretel - only fortunately in this they aren't going to get eaten by a witch. Their search for who they are, what they want in life and vice versa gives them that click so rare in films you wish it could have lasted forever.A wise man once said 'Life is a funny thing' another wise man said 'Films are very popular these days' and it seems Sofia Coppola said 'Lets put both these ideas together and make a masterpiece' and it seems she did so with ease. To the minority the experience will be sorely wasted and it's a real shame they will spend the next 1 hour 40 minutes looking at a pixulated screen with glazed eyes. But hopefully if you appreciate the concept that there are these ordinary, blends-in-with-the-crowd types of people who have something so lovable then you will see how special this relationship actually is.Bill Murray gives in a word a fantasticallyfunnyoscarworthyperformance as Bob while Scarlett Johansson as well as proving she has the best bum in the world by frequently forgetting any clothing below her waist except her semi-transparent Bridget Jones knickers, makes the character Charlotte draw about every ounce of sympathy from you, so that weren't even aware you had that much to start with. But it's Sofia Coppola's screenplay that beautifully puts the cherry on the cake making a film that could have you laughing to the verge of crying to even make you re-evaluate what you want out of your own life.Which is why folks saying this is a must see film would be the biggest understatement ever. So without sounding too desperate make sure you at least give it a rent. Pretty please.",10,1,3,5 May 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Average additions be gone, things are starting to get magic at last.
","No-one was forthcoming about OOTP and HBP. They have succeeded in the infamous Potter manoeuvre of neither being wildly brilliant or atrociously laughable, but always being huge box office phenomenon's that have now outdone the likes of Star Wars, so they must have been doing something right, right? Well other than being the best franchise rights attained by Warner Bros. for being such a successful series, they always were inviting to people new to the experience, specifically those who hadn't read the books. The problem? The people who are fans of the book (including your dear critic) are always spotting the missing scenes, the awkward relationships - that aren't supposed to be awkward and the rare but recent addition of scenes that had as much logic and point behind them as singing into a turned on Hoover nozzle. So being the best book, (arguably) the routinely depression encased within the restriction Hogwarts has lifted, as has the more customary check list. Big castle, problem, another problem, acting sad, kissing, wand walloping, morning, end. For once the relationships, like the plot, aren't constraint to the walls of Hogwarts, they are free at last. Though Yates has been irksomely juggling the same premise for two films too long he makes up by, fi-na-le being faithful through the decision to cleanly cut the film in two. He also includes additional scenes (wait for it) that aren't unlike the characters motivations; HBP had the attack of the Burrow scene with no motivation from Death Eaters what so ever. In Deathly Hallows there are emotional additions that aren't hosted in a sulky and heavy atmosphere, such as when Harry is trying to console Hermione. The film also amplifies its standard of being funny, something which the books only mildly covered as a quick disengagement from the 'fun'. And for the first time in history, when the newly instated Minister of Magic quotes: 'These are dark times, there is no denying.' the theme turned cliché of diluting the lighting for the gazillionth time so it's darker therefore 'more rugged and scary' - lives up to its sense of impending doom, without having the usual buzz of hopeful expectancy followed by obvious disappointment - like the lottery always does. It's quiet easy to be bitter about the fact the best director, Alfonso Cuaron, never got the chance to make another instalment that could have established a new high point of the relatively indistinguishable mountain but saying that, Yates would never have got the chance to prove he can make one of the best additions to the series, that wasn't even close to being the money-grabbing, giant tease it could have been. If Part II can be this enjoyable to all audiences, then the Potter finale will rouse as much love as when he was first seen branded with his slogan scar and if not, it would at least be well-deserved to see Part I make the top 250.",8,0,1,28 November 2010
American Beauty," 'It's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world' So true for American Beauty
","There seems to be a host of mid-life crisis films that get magnetised to me. First was Lost in Translation, now it's American Beauty (I would be surprised if the next one is James Bond). And they both have a lot in common. Hugely funny, tragic and more gripping than if you cling-filmed yourself to the TV while they were playing.Kevin Spacey (You can start to get excited now) plays Lester Burnham, an advertising executive who despises his job, has a marriage 'just for show', has a daughter who hates him and he nurtures a crush for her friend Angela. Okay wait a minute, that sounds a tad like a paedophile; but he has a reasonable excuse in that he is suffering all the former three - oh and the fact he has a year to live.There are no explosions, tacky use of CGI or bad placed performances. It's just an accurate interpretation of a family willing to cover up its inevitable division and loathing for each other. What makes it so special is how realistic it becomes without ever falling to the standards of a melodramatic soap opera drama.First timers: Director Sam Mendes and Writer Alan Ball have struck gold. No scrap that, they have struck beauty; and made a film so immersive, so enjoyable and just, well perfect it feels like any other duo could have ruined the fragile issues and motif's that are so sensitively handled.Plus the fact that Kevin Spacey is some type of acting God - I never realised how hilarious arguments can be; there is really nothing that can be faulted about American Beauty and it fully deserves its place in the IMDb top 250.",10,0,1,14 June 2010
Salt," Stick with Pepper
","Similar to The Hobbit, Bourne 4 finds itself in the middle of no-man's-land with little flavour to wet fans appetites. Jolie's latest heroine excursion as Salt proves to be less than substantial for those hoping not to find a film that seems to dither on occasional blasts of adrenaline, to twists which fall out of grasp to be tied up neat enough to be passable.Unlike Bourne's rediscovery of identity, Salt is on the run to clear her name and save her husband after a Russian defector accuses her of being KGB sleeper agent. Sadly another misleading trailer leaves an almost bitterly disappointed finished result. It never successfully seems to blend the style and motivation of Salt without going slightly daft in the plot to make the film more definable in its own right.Salt (the character) takes to new extremes, the lengths of modern day heroes/heroines. The change in lead (it was originally going to be Tom Cruise as the lead) has, if anything, shown Jolie again being superiorly capable in her role as a heroine with a deadly affinity with weapons. And while it may not have been satisfying watching the clunky plot unfold, Angelina has the sex appeal and grace to pull off what a younger budding amateur could not have done to the movie; make it (mostly) work.",4,2,6,19 August 2010
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," 'An epic of epic epicness' is another Edger epic experience.
","The familiar ingredients in this film are eminent. Love triangles, gay roommate, seven evil exes Whoa. Hold the phone, that doesn't sound like clichéd flop? That's because for the first time, in a very, very long time there is a romcom (with plenty of action, don't worry) which points its radar more to the boys than the girls – for once.Hapless Scott already has a girlfriend: Knives Chau, but then falls for eccentric haired Ramona Flowers (Cheerleading Death Proofer'). This mushy mess gets even uglier when the infamous boyfriends start to appear – but in a cracking arcade style that will easily make geeks heads explode, though that will unlikely add anymore colour to the screen. If that still isn't enough for you, the screen is burdened with oldie-style Batman film jargon's; everything from 'Whip' to 'Plonk' to the 'Dddddddddd' of a guitar note. Perfectionist Edgar has clearly exerted all his efforts into making a worthy third outing after Shaun of the Dead (his best) and Hot Fuzz (his newly instated third best after Pilgrim). True the script is barmy, but the wit is still pin-prick sharp and the momentous special effects give a gamers zest under the multitude of colour that isn't just Ramona's hair.Surprisingly not in 3D and surprisingly/disappointingly lacking a bare minimum of a cameo from Frost and Pegg, but there is so many quotable characters and realistic scenarios in an unrealistic world you'll soon get past it.",8,2,11,8 September 2010
City of God," More like City of Godly acting, directing and sheer brilliance which never wavers for a moment
","Ah yes, City of God what a film, what a film. If your not a fan of subtitle films and won't watch any at least make sure this is an exception because you definitely won't regret it.Alexandre Rodrigues plays Rocket (the nicknames aren't the only good thing about the film) who like everyone else in the City of God lives between rival drug gangs in a world of sex, drugs and violence as a way of life. Rocket, has a story to tell and glorious one at that, almost everyone in the film gets their own mini-biography with different main characters being woven in and out each others stories.Obviously this isn't a lighted hearted or jolly 130 minutes, it's cruel, intense and doesn't let the minute details of the plot become insignificant - as the end proves. Meaning there is a hell of a lot of satisfaction to get when all the pieces of jigsaw beautifully fit together. The shoot-outs, drug taking and massive amount of betrayal all ultimately make a culture undeniably worthy a trip of those regular and not so regular film goers.",10,1,3,15 March 2010
Drive," The Best Film of 2011 (so far)
","For a year where the lack of spectacular has been crushingly disappointing Drive stands out even more impressively than it normally would. Tonally consistent, staggeringly hypnotic and beautifully stylised (but not detracting from the sheer realism) Drive marks itself as a clear contestant for one of the best films of the year.The story is simple, an anonymous driver who works as a stuntman for the movies is also a heist driver who gets drawn into a world of crime. It's not the high octane adrenaline fuelled ride it markets itself as, but a richly characterised and carefully handled story. Not as experimental or misdirected as Bronson, it operates far more precisely; whereas Bronson never gave the impression it knew what it wanted to do with itself Drive maintains gritty realism throughout, never dawdling on irrelevance and offering us some truly captivating moments.Its lack of superficial (or rather Hollywood) elements is greatly reassuring; Fast and Furious eye-rolling implausibility this isn't. Instead we get some genuinely real moments that we never question as eye candy and always has relevance to the story. Gosling is terrific, Winding Refn even better, do everyone a favour and see this best film that's hit cinema's this year.",10,2,7,25 September 2011
Kick-Ass," Kick Ass does exactly what it says on the label. Oh yeah.
","Now being a fan of Matthew Vaughn's last two films, Kick-Ass clearly seemed like his most controversial outing to date, without even comparing it to his other work. Both Layer Cake and Stardust both though enjoyable and well received felt like discrete nods to the distributors that this man can do a fine job of directing no matter what the genre and that he deserves the room for development, since showing he is capable of great potential.Then came along Kick-Ass, which easily is one of this years must see's, simply because it is nothing and everything like you expect. Example: Expect the costumes to look out of place, expect the C-word bomb from an 11 year old girl and expect a finale that almost makes the end of Kill Bill Volume 1 look like a fairytale. However what wasn't expected was the hilarious conversations between Big Daddy (Nic Cage as a Earless Batman) and his daughter Hit Girl (The awe inspiring Chloe Moretz) and the vast amount of violence, dark humour and the way it walks all over society like another blood splattered corpse of satisfaction.Dave Livewski (Aaron Johnson) struggles to understand why there is no active costumed vigilante's around in New York to stop crime, and through his comic inspired heroism decides to become Kick-Ass (The hero this time, not the film title). So with his cheesy green wetsuit, determination and lack of social life, Dave's roller-coaster begins. His near fatal experience's doesn't hinder his growing reputation or superhero buddies including Red Mist (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and the infamous father-daughter duo to bringing blood-blitzed peace to a crime-ridden city.Kick-Ass is a guilty pleasure that people shouldn't be ashamed to enjoy on the basis of the blaspheming and gore infested mass killings. There is a huge amount of likability for the leads who have all done justice to make the most of their characters capabilities; Chloe Moretz deserves particular credit to her notorious role by putting the 'Gonna blow your brains out' in well, just that. Matthew Vaughn has clearly established himself as a man of many talents and after this it's not hard to see why, there is certainly room for a sequel on the horizon, that's for sure.",10,5,17,31 March 2010
The Hurt Locker," Bigelow: 6 Cameron: 3 unlucky James but Kathryn really did a better job
","Now I'm just going to clear the air here and say: Yes I thoroughly enjoyed Avatar and it was by no means your average run of the mill and certainly achieved global success. But in all honesty I thought this film DID deserve the Oscar wins more than Avatar simply because it seemed to raise the bar on every level about the Iraq war without becoming blood-blitzed, monotonous and emotionally stunted war film.The Hurt Locker honestly exceeded about every expectation I well, expected. After reading about the handfuls of Oscars it managed to scope I was eager to see Kathryn's interpretation and be blown away and fortunately I wasn't left disappointed. It proves that Old-School docudramas can be more of a treat than the CGI feast that Cameron served up - not that I had anything wrong with that.Now if you ever thought your job was bad wait till you see what happens to these poor guys. They have the rather risky job of bomb-disposal which means you can obviously expect some explosions which really do pinpoint the risk that these soldiers (and of course the non-actor ones) take everyday. Bigelow's a visionary no doubt about it, she perfectly captures the emotional trauma and strain that soldiers are put through while keeping it tense enough to create an atmosphere that is stereotypical of most horrors.The perfectly cast actors, constant sense of unending and foreboding tension and inter-twisted conflicts of loyalty in the characters, with one of the best female directors of this time make this an absolute war epic that really will highlight the impact of some not so everyday soldiers in brutal fashion.",10,3,14,10 March 2010
Avatar," Cameron's latest epic doesn't fall short of proving he is more capable at still making masterpieces which will amaze.
","Yes James Cameron's done it again, gripped the world in a matter of days with another blockbuster of groundbreaking special effects which seem like they are years ahead of their time. Set in 2154 on Pandora we follow Jake Scully a wheelchair bound marine who is asked to take his twin brothers place for the Avatar programme. Admittedly Worthington doesn't particularly shine as Jake especially in the first part of the film where his acting seems to lack any emotion at the loss of his brother. Fortunately this isn't the case for the whole film; it develops dramatically when he becomes one of the local Na'vi people; portraying it brilliantly and convincingly throughout the rest of the film. The Na'vi mesmerise with such little effort and realism throughout the film and simply because they are more lifelike than anything ever seen on the cinema for such a long time, which is understandably why it was delayed for so long after being scripted since 1994 by Cameron. The sheer beauty and scale of his vision which he has depicted perfectly in the film is an overwhelming sight that flourishes gloriously for your eyes. The big and small details of Avatar such as the way the floor glows beneath their feet or the fact that they have their own unique culture seems to make everything about this film so lifelike and immersing to watch. Zoë Saldaña gives fantastic support as a local Na'vi who shows Sam what it means to be one of them, and oh boy do you wish you could be there with them. It's the most surreal, thrilling and downright gripping experiences of 2009. No it's unlikely to change cinema for you so that nothing will compare to it but it's a film unlike any other and a definite must see especially in 3D.",8,4,9,3 January 2010
Saw," Sawley you can't be serious?
","You have a brief warning from the Production Company 'Twisted Pictures' then the mayhem begins. Could be the most horrifying, enjoyable or most passable excuse you have to keep constantly changing your underwear for the many scares in store. But one thing is certain: watching it alone, at night time, lights off, completely alone isn't wise.I don't mind blood, heck I even ate spaghetti during Reservoir Dog's infamous torture scene. But when I absolutely, positively have the living daylights scared out me, you know the movie is very, very good.Two guys in an abandoned bathroom, alone with handcuffs (No it isn't an introduction to gay pornography, this is how the film starts). They have nothing but spooky video tapes and a look to suggest having a hangover isn't fun. They don't even know how they got there, who each other are and well, much about anything else.Then as the film progresses the story naturally starts to piece together like a jigsaw (See what I did there Saw fans?). And just when you think it's all been neatly put in place another shocker hits you square in the face - not literally I should add, maybe that's what 3D technology should do next? The first hour-ish of the film is short on explanation which makes it all feel very unnerving and gives it a flavouring similar to David Fincher's Se7en; absolutely no complaints about that.But Saw is as good scaring as it is, the next plot shocker, making it a must see for any horror fan or the ones who miss checking under their bed for any night terror.",8,0,1,17 June 2010
A Clockwork Orange," I'm laughing and loving in the shame. Du-du-du-du...
","There's been an alarming lack of undeserving classics reviewed these past few weeks. It's not as what could be perceived as spontaneous generosity, or keeping on par with what is deemed as appropriate by critics but rather the standard is, or was, so ignorant of sub-level greatness they all take the crown by the strength of their hands and seem incapable of letting go. Then next week comes and it's prised effortlessly from their clutch. But with A Clockwork Orange, now arguably Kubrick's greatest, in contrast to FMJ, 2001, The Shining and EWS, the film has lifted not just from last weeks, but from his own hands.Though initially sceptical of Kubrick's 'gift' having started with his least tremendous, Eyes Wide Shut, which was no dastardly Friedberg and Seltzer combination, but to an outsider breaching the circle of meticulousness and cinematic genius, wasn't the most forthcoming or prestigious of his films. But a distasteful (back then) introduction has lead to what is now, pure admiration. A Clockwork Orange continues his stainless visage, incorporating the aid of classic music which has ironically never been more suited to something so contradictory yet complimentary.As far as controversy goes (and these days it's, pretty, pretty far) Clockwork has tremendously surpassed all graphic expectations with flying screams and violence. But with Kubrick, the quantity never ranked below the quality; true its explicit characters, story and content can have you lunging for the nearest available sick bag, and the profanity seems scarcely mild compared to the fiery zest that sexual violence stings you with, but all the text book requirements are dutifully ticked along the way so there's no doubt of any excessive violence just for the sake of it in Kubrick's safe hands.Within these requirements are: the captivating characters – Malcolm McDowell sadly overlooked in his youth for making the Tyler Durden-ish teenager, a heart heaving tragic case. Rich black comedy – when you delve deep into your own shame, such as the attack of the giant genital ornament. Contrapuntal sound – 'I'm singing in the rain' Whack. Slap. Kick. 'Just singing in the rain' Scissors. Forced clothes removal. Guess the rest. If that was unearthed to be a shocking statement, that's not a loose thread on Clockwork's jacket. Then the most important component: a blend of all these.It's reassuring that Kubrick didn't take the fake route of not including the inhumanity when doing the screenplay. It makes the film so harrowing, so real, so perfect. If he took the adult friendly (it's too extreme to be tarred down to teenage friendly) route of showing us a wall to conceal the excessive (but necessary) blood spilling and clothe dispensing, how else would you expect to learn about the character? If it was all tucked away and hidden from audiences, would it have acquired its deserving cult status? Unlikely, or its cinematic recognition – e.g. the fast-mo 'Inny Outy' threesome is probably the best sex scene to ever be put on screen (only Kubrick could make you say that about a film).When fellow Brit-film Peeping Tom caused a stir it actually ended the director's career despite being a misjudged masterpiece. It makes you shiver at the thought if that had happened to Kubrick, but at least it would have terminated his career with his biggest and best bang.",10,0,2,26 November 2010
Eyes Wide Shut," Seems like there is an alternative for Viagra
","Meeting the in-laws for the first time can be uncomfortable, especially watching a film that guarantees the awkward fidgeting to kick in. Luckily I wasn't presented with this scenario, so as a future warning it's probably best to stick with The Sound of Music rather than suggest this.Eyes Wide Shut, other than being mentally scaring to the people who ban the word 'Willy' in their home, is a very odd movie indeed. In fact other than bordering the porn genre and making the American Pie films seem worthy of a U rating (even the rubbish new ones), it's hard to know what to make of it.Doctor Bill has everything. Pretty wife, great job, family lifestyle and even looks as handsome as Tom Cruise. Oh err, yes that's right it is Tom Cruise. That is until his wife - Kidman, who quite literally gives plenty of meat to her role, confesses to almost cheating on Bill.Obviously when such a situation occurs it is best to get as laid as possible with anyone with a pulse, rather than talk his issues through with dear wife Alice. Or that's what Bill wants to happen. None of this is particularly odd, only that Bill would rather spend time outdoors in New York City than be with his frequently-undresses-as-soon-as-the-camera-comes-within-a-mile-of-her wife.The mid way point when it takes a Rocky Horror type turn for location and mystery, and where it all gets very peculiar. Still no spoilers from here onwards, so if you want to know what happens this is worth a rent (again reminder, not with the in-laws).It's recommended not to be borrowed from a teenage boy, since if you know of the annoyance of a scene from a DVD being vastly overplayed and becoming blotchy, you will definitely find the first one hour thirty minutes a bumpy ride - and unsurprisingly not for the plot. Ahem.The ending will separate viewers so much into mixed opinions, that doing julienne on an onion would have less division. You'll end up feeling you have either wasted two sexually fuelled hours of your life or that you can't quite understand what to make of it or you'll love it or you'll hate it or you'll spend another two hours afterwards Googleing Nicole Kidman. Maybe you should just leave it several years to re-watch to see what you think, if the in-laws feel up to it.",6,1,2,28 May 2010
The Untouchables," The Unkemptables
","An uncompromising style was lit by The Godfather and refuelled by Goodfellas during the 20th century; anything in the before or during stage of the two ceased to exist in masterpiece terms for very long. The idea to simply make a mob movie a cop drama revolving around Al Capone seems to be feigning the notion that true gangsters can still be told the other side of the fence effectively. They can't, or rather this can't half as well as it could have.It's all smothered in the look though. Perfected haircuts, brandished liquor, breathed mists of cigar lit mercy, so in the respect of playing the era, it is the best character to be found – though Connery also gives it enough reason to watch (unsurprisingly). Costner, also playing a mostly straight laced, no nonsense police officer along with two other 'characters' who form the untouchables.Admirable though it is to detract from the mob lifestyle, to show segments of it that seem to have no use except characterisation is cruel. Especially when the tension and style is carried with it, in sweet but short blips. Costner also can't seem to entirely stray from his Western prime either, that segment feels nothing more than a word in from himself or a hastily added diversion from the office scenery. Biased though this is coming from a gangster fan, fellow police drama Zodiac worked brilliantly and that was as ambiguous as you could hope for.In short, if the last twenty minutes had been as good as what preceded it then this would have been a more than welcome change in perspective. Turns out it isn't.",6,0,3,15 December 2010
Inception," In the dictionary under the word 'Flawless' is a poster of Inception. Yes, it's really that good.
","There are many movie mysteries in life: What did Bob say to Charlotte in Lost in Translation? What will the second Kill Bill sequel called? Will Toy Story 3 make or break my childhood dreams? But out of all of these obscurities, the knowledge that Inception will, in all likelihood be as overlooked at the upcoming Academy Awards as Nolan's last film: The Dark Knight, is the most frustrating.Unlike his iconic mish-mash chronology of his prior filmography, the narrative (though not for once without it's thought provoking logic) generally remains undemanding and plausible.Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) understands the infectious power of an idea or otherwise known as: 'The greatest parasite'. Notwithstanding his highly perilous job, which is usually to remove an idea from a set target, he now has to, in order to save his family, triumph the widely considered impossibility of an inception: The ability to plant an idea within the mind of a victim rather than remove it.Less than a year fresh from his first class Shutter Island performance, DiCaprio firmly remains a beacon of admiration to aspiring young actors yet again. Undeniably a riveting performance. Juno's Ellen Page helps clarify sense of the psychotic dream state as a newly recruited member of the group, making the triumphant tale and importance of Inception less confusing than expected. Support also comes from talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard and Michael Caine – who to Nolan refers to as his lucky charm; not that he needs one.Nolan, having now just finished his 7th film, with four of his previous works among the IMDb top 250, all with certified freshness and a scarcely small amount of Oscar nominations, at the very least deserves a Best Director Nomination for the Memento movie making maestro. And sadly it looks like we'll have to wait a long time to find that outSummer disappointments be gone. Inception is here.",10,7,14,16 July 2010
Prometheus," It Should Have Been A Masterpiece
","Where to start? It doesn't take an Alien fan, or even a film fan to know Prometheus is a big event. It's every bit as visually stunning as the trailer suggested, Fassbender is as every bit effortless as everyone has mentioned, but every problem that it suffers circulates back to its script.The writer, Damon Lindelof, doesn't shake his typical Lost quandary of asking twice as many questions, to half as many answers meaning it is simply a starting point to a franchise. Example (spoiler-free), a 'twist' occurs towards the start of the third act involving two major characters that adds absolutely no narrative significance. It's as if Lindelof decided interjecting something, even as tenuous as this, was better than having nothing at all.Alien seems an appropriate parallel but Alien is entirely different. Claustrophobic, tense, characters who we cared about, feared for, who spoke wonderful dialogue (my personal favourite, Ash calling the xenomorph 'Kane's son' – simple, brilliant). None of this is in Prometheus, even the main characters are largely underdeveloped. It's a series of issues that don't evolve – Shaw's Christianity completely unchallenged, David's allegiance never really brought into light (less enigmatic, more irritating) it sets up great ideas, but ones that never formulate beyond the 'Why?' stage.And scares? All would agree Alien maintained an unwavering level of fear by revealing so little. Prometheus has it on full display, leaving nothing to the imagination. CG may be an innovation, but is sure as hell overkilled what would have been more effective through minimalism. It's interesting that the most horrifying scene involved no extra-terrestrial life, just a person against another person.This rant would make it seem like Prometheus is a bad film. This is not the case. But there is so much wrong with it, so much that makes six months hype evaporate within two mere hours, it's a film that should have been a reward after enduring the latter two entries of the Alien franchise. But it's muddled, often silly, and generally an upsetting experience.",4,49,95,3 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," Xcellent
","Though many have falsely labelled this the Batman Begins of the X-Men franchise, it is undoubtedly the reboot needed for the franchise after 2009's disastrous X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and while it doesn't have the pulsating energy of Kick-Ass nor merit the bravo of Batman Begins it does provide the much needed direction after films 3 and 4.It'd be fair to call this a prequel too, back tracking to the origins of its famous founders of the X-Men. James McAvoy stars as smooth talking Charles Xavier, a recently successful graduate and Michael Fassbender as the tormented victim of WWII who seeks revenge. The two ultimately meet and share the same goal for wanting to help fellow mutants but go to extreme and opposite lengths to achieve this goal.Vaughn yet again proves there are still areas to be found and new notes to be struck in the superhero genre. The action has never looked (or felt) more intense, the drama more emotional but rewarding and the general experience one that will surely be relived by people who aren't just hard-core comic book viewers.However it would have far more impressive as a debut for a first time director, and you can't help but draw comparisons to Vaughn's previous (and in Kick-Ass's case: better) work. It lacks the brilliance for someone who knows how to handle the genre and material he is presented with, but don't get me wrong for the fast-paced ride it proves to be X-Men First Class is a lot of fun, and with an unexpected cameo, great chemistry – particularly between Fassbender and McAvoy and a story that is both satisfying and original it's definitely worth a look. Just don't go in expecting too much – you may be left feeling slightly disappointed.",8,2,5,12 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Exactly what it needed to be - masterful.
","And so it all ends – intricately and as every bit as impressive as its predecessors. Bruce Wayne is now an early retired recluse, unneeded by a now safe Gotham – that is until he has to don the suit yet again with the emergence of Bane . What makes this final entry so satisfying (though it's no spoiler to say there are new directions it could take) is that it returns to a city in the wake of The Joker's zeitgeist terrorism. There is a genuine sense that Batman is no longer needed – all the more triumphant therefore when Bruce finally has to wear the suit.There are unnecessary amounts of flashbacks, and although you get used to it, Bane never sounds like you'd want him to. But these flaws are so minor, that taken as a whole The Dark Knight Rises is an overwhelming triumph – one that has true emotional engagement that transcends the costumes and superhero gloss. Ultimately this is Bruce Wayne's story again, appropriately given the cyclic nature of the plot. It's not without being overly obvious to say for a full understanding of The Dark Knight Rises, Batman Begins needs to be seen beforehand. The Dark Knight too. On the surface the premise is an echo of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns, however the only crossover is that of thematic content – the isolating nature of Bruce no longer needing to maintain a duel identity. But it'd be a lie to say The Dark Knight Rises isn't confident in testing the suspension of disbelief that matches some of the comics' most extreme ideas (concerning vehicles). But Nolan makes it works, aligning some of the less 'real' content into his own interpretation of Batman's world seamlessly. And given the furious momentum of the film it rarely feels rushed; certainly doesn't drag for a film near three hours. As for Bane – he never leaves the shadow of The Joker, especially given the similarly chaotic nature of the characters. But whereas The Joker was unsettling in his spontaneous behaviour, Bane is far more controlled and has logic for actions. This is good thing in providing a discernible storyline, but what made The Dark Knight so exciting was the fear of being led into the unknown through The Joker's unprovoked actions. But it's a lie to say The Dark Knight Rises is at all bad. If it doesn't win Best Picture (which it won't) then no Batman film ever will.",10,2,8,20 July 2012
Toy Story 3," There's going to be Oscar Buzz (and Woody) for this threequel
","The Godfather Part 3 couldn't pull it off, Spider-man 3 couldn't pull it off and don't even get me started on the third Matrix film. But here finally after 11 years since the Toy Story 2 was released is a second sequel that gives the original Star Wars trilogy a run for it's huge age range of fans, huge quantity of fans and most importantly lives up to it's even huger expectations at every turn.Like about every fan of Pixar who was an eager novice of the film makers when they first released Toy Story in 1995, I have watched every successful run of some equally enjoyable and more expansively collective films ranging from The Incredibles to Up which have clearly gathered even more of a fan base for those who missed the early wonders of when Pixar first began.In particular, Pixar who are renown for their rare gift of rich story telling, have more recently created those tales that come from the heart and captured audiences emotionally without making the charm or humour distasteful because script writers were concentrating too hard elsewhere. Even the weaker of the films (Cars in particular) shared this constant factor when struggling to be sympathetically strenuous. Up was especially effective at this and its no surprise the third outing of Toy Story was going to be sharing this same compassion.In keeping with the yearly reoccurrences of a newly made animated tale, Pixar have kept the years that have passed of us watching and fawning over their films the same as the time that has passed within when we last watched the gang.This has obviously resulted in some major character growth, from Andy now a fully grown teenager starting college to Buster, the family dog who the years have taken their sorry toll on, albeit still with witty effect at making his hopelessness and newly shabby appearance amusing.Sadly this means Andy no longer carries the affection for his toys (as an audience this is hard to relate to, if you love them as much as I do) meaning his move to college will result with their move to Sunnyside Daycare – which despite the optimistic name doesn't hold dear to Woody's heart rather than his more preferred option (to the others toys dismay) of staying in the houses' attic and waiting for Andy's kids to discover them years later.The ending of the film, which was as nostalgia filled as expected does a tremendous job of concluding the morals and love of the story between the characters and audiences it has shared it with. If you found Up sad well wait till you watch this, because hiding your crying eyes behind a box of popcorn is harder than you might think – and a skill you will need to know before watching.Pixar, who have pulled off something considered more of an impossibility the what was attempted in Inception, have successfully have blended new characters (Ken was a comedian with little effort) and a plot that didn't dither on uncertainty of where to find its feet on new territory for the third time.",10,1,2,25 July 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A journey that will always be remembered.
","Having carried the burden of guiltily concealing a debt to Peter Jackson's widely known and acclaimed trilogy, only now do I realise I can truly call myself a film fan. Calling it outstanding, brilliant, perfect, would simply being echoing past recognition, which you already know of.Up until the point of watching I was convinced the likes of other trilogies (such as the repetition dodging Toy Story and Star Wars) would always out do what I used see as a medieval fantasy filled with mythical creatures. Yet there's something incredibly humane about LOTR as a whole, the pointy ears and hairy feet may dismiss such an idea but when the soundtrack swells (as does your heart) you get, to quote the narrator of Fight Club: Lost in oblivion.Before watching I didn't know my elf from my hobbit, now I know my Gollum from my Gandalf, my Gondor from my Mordor. Back in The Two Towers our hairy footed friends had grudgingly united with Gollum who continues to offer his schizophrenic 'assistance' of taking Sam and Frodo to an unknown entrance that will let them pass into Mordor unnoticed; while the rest of the divided fellowship meet up at Isengard in the aftermath of the Ents' Greenpeace revolt â€“ which compared to the also CG rendered but vastly epic battles in Return of the King, was just a taster.The effects themselves clearly cusp the 3D phenomenon, that was breached several years too late not that it doesn't spell in-your-face politely either. They still remain cinematically impressive, particularly when the heat of the battle flourishes fresh new soundtrack scores on such a vast scale. My only criticism is (sounding like a severe case of fanboyism here) that whole film goes so damn fast, even though it clocks in at the three hour mark; and that's coming from someone who had little prior knowledge beforehand.Why? Because it's a journey. Never in my pitiful viewing history have I felt more transported to a different world so fluently, flawlessly, fixatedly. A world that could blister your eyes with tears and have your heart wrenching new-fangled rewards it didn't know existed. Not in the sense of being such a bum-numbing saga, but that it's a film that couldn't feel any less of a film, and it will be revisited again and again and again.",10,0,1,19 December 2010
Get Him to the Greek," Get me to the greatness of the Greek - Again!
","After 2008's quirky romcom Forgetting Sarah Marshall – arguably that years' best giggle wiggle, I was surprised to see that there was going to be a sequel, even if it was indirect, because: a) Sequels rarely work and b) Why ruin what was so enjoyable about the first? It's like if they did 'The 50 Year Old Virgin', it would completely make people reluctant to ever watch Steve Carell again, though Evan Almighty did a good enough job of that.But here in all its Russell Brandness is a sequel that almost is as good as the first. Hallelujah! This time round instead of Jason Segel being our leading lad, its Russell Brand playing a British rock version of himself, who is being taken from London to L.A. within 72 hours via Aaron Green (Jonah Hill). This however is apparently considered an impossibility and after seeing 0.25 seconds of Aldous Snow, it isn't hard to see why.If you hate Russell Brand this really isn't for you (Duh?). Everything from his Edward Scissor Hands hairdo to his teenage libido is at an all-time high for 99% of the film, the other 1% being the credits. Hence it is unsurprising why many consider this the visual/audio version of his 'My Booky Wook'. Personally I love dear Russell, to the point of wanting to dip him in my coffee and put sprinkles all over his head.Russell along with Jonah Hill and P.Diddy make a threesome that is a delightfully humorous combination, like a modern day 'Apatow' version of the three wise men. On the topic of threesomes, that word will never have the same pleasurable meaning again after seeing Get Him to the Greek - just stay away from a horny Jonah Hill, that's all I'm saying.Out of all the whole grain goodness of the film - sorry about that, I forgot it wasn't a cereal, the Las Vegas scene is quite easily the most funny. It has the kind of mayhem you'd expect to have happened during the drunkenness of The Hangover. There is also a scene within that of an adrenaline shot which compared to the heart stopping nervousness of Pulp Fictions' certainly isn't the counterpart.Admittedly Forgetting Sarah Marshall is marginally funnier, but that doesn't mean if there was a threequel I would at all be hesitant to watch it. My bets on it being Kristen Bell and her cheesy in-film television shows – but I'd much rather have them call it a day than risk another spin-off.",6,0,2,30 June 2010
300," 300 - 294 = 6 Well earned stars
","More arrows than Robin Hood. More slushy sword slashing than Kill Bill. And more underrated than expected of the critics who balanced it firmly on the halfway mark. It may not live up to Snyder's most recent graphic novel adaptation but it's a should-be-3D action epic that kicks with an extra 'This is Sparta!' Unlike the diplomatic and looming dilemma his Watchmen adaptation cast over the film like a suffocating tyrant of grim news of nuclear war, 300 takes the less radical and more hands on approach to their strenuous problem of how to save Sparta from the impending threat of Persian destruction.Gerard (Butler) and his small squadron of loyal and ridiculously muscular soldiers embark to act before their advantage of leaving the village for the safety of women and children gets the better of them. It doesn't delve too much into the political side of the war (not sure about whether the graphic novel did) especially when there are throats to be cut in ferocious but terrific style.The backdrop to the massacres while being so blatantly beautiful not to be CGI, it's a rare sepia-esquire faÃ§ade showing the times they are fighting in, such as the lesser impressive beige colours in Gladiator or the T.V. series of Rome. However, ironically the heavy handed use of CGI can often make the film feel overcooked and lacking humane substance to such an inhumane film (not that I was expecting lengthy sessions of mourning for their slaughter or many layers of depth under the visuals).Definitely a visual treat, particularly the slow-mo scene which terrifically isn't like anything on screen ever seen in a film, in spite of slow moving murder being a common screen spectacle.",6,1,2,1 October 2010
Moon," It's like The Bourne Identity set in space
","In an age of elaborate lanky blue folk who talk the talk, fly the fly and speak Na'vi or else giant prawns with their impressive 'Independence Day' ship looming in the background and an appetite for cat food, its sometimes understandably hard to forget there's such a thing as a ostentatious visuals that isn't fiction or OTT enough to mascara a rather plain plot.Moon (that giant grey blob in the sky) isn't at all deprived from beauty, especially in 1080p, however that doesn't make it like other sci-fi's these days. Its small budget, has few characters, has plenty of Sam Rockwell, and to top it all is a very thought provoking debut from a director who happens to be David Bowie's son: Duncan. Pretty different right? But it's the foremost point where Moon is almost entirely contrary that makes it a fundamental but essential independent movie.Sam (played by Sam) is just finishing his three contract of supplying energy from the moon to earth, to be reunited with his wife and child. He gets some nasty Shutter Island form of hallucinations before he severely crashes his moon truck-thingy and soon after, quiet literally meets his match. I won't give away anything more than the trailer because well no-one likes a spoil sport and for such a rare heart wrenching solely driven performance by Sam, I find it hard not to justify credit even if you have or haven't seen it with your own eyes.Kevin Spacey also stars, however he will be in a box shape form with a yellow face. Shouldn't be hard to spot; especially if you have seen a certain Stanley Kubrick film recently. But as previously mentioned a great story, unreliant on its look that has given Rockwell the chance to prosper with a lead role, easily puts the likes of Hollywood's multi-million extravaganza's to shame.",10,2,12,6 July 2010
Back to the Future," 25 years on and it could still teach so many films so many lessons.
","Back in the decade of 'In space no-one can hear you scream', Lightsaber swashbuckling Jedi and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger cradling that not so delicate pump-action, bad-ass necessity; it seemed only appropriate to throw time travel in the mix of a genre that was starting to expand more and more with some good ol' computer technology, which back then, didn't have to become the primary tool in a directors box of apparatus.So when Back to the Future spurted the fiery paths of tire grinding, followed by a once handsome DeLorean turned four wheeled ice block, the questioned was: what made it so much different, better, cooler? Simply, whereas other sci-fi's that demonstrated so effortlessly the compulsive need to slap audiences jaw drop levels further down to the ground, explosion by explosion, Back to the Future arguably took a more humour through simplicity approach.Example, body language. Nothing that will be spoilt of course, but the deliberate motions of characters (especially in the diner) can tell an audience all they'd need to know about a character, before their identity was fully revealed through this interaction. Funny, yes. But not till it scratches the surface more deeply do things start to get more than standard slapstick, especially where family is concerned.That doesn't mean the film lacked, an albeit Michael Bay need for some wanted explosions and top techno talk to remind us throughout it was a sci-fi ('1.21 gigawatts? 1.21 gigawatts? Great Scott!'), and hadn't took the 'Humour of his mum fancying him' path too far and sloppily. If anything, science is more of a focus than anything else.Not for the obvious fact it's a science fiction (Bravo) but more that Marty is as confused with 'Docs' long winded trails of scientific calculations with himself as we are. And ironically, he understands the ins and outs so easily his madness seems ordinary. It's all Marty's dumbfound confusion and the audiences comfort of knowing 'We never need to know what on earth a Flux Capacitor is so let's go along with it'. This all makes the baffling intellect more of a reassurance everything will work, rather than a panicky and frantic turn of heads to understand every little detail as to not get lost in its 'family friendly' plot. And that's what it's all about. It never needs to go into drawn out explanations that only scientific universities would host, it's a thrill ride, Marty's ride, our ride; with two more stops yet to go.",10,1,1,1 November 2010
Up in the Air," Exuberant and undeniably likable with Clooney on excellent form as usual
","Boring, predictable plot? Strained and awkward acting? Overrated and doesn't deserve the recognition it's been getting? Half the cast look like they're from Shameless? None of these could even come close to being the truth - except perhaps the Shameless one. I'm more than thrilled to say that this film really does live up to the hype and Oscar nominations rightly surrounding it.Clooney gives a spot-on performance as a lonely but enthused worker who travels regularly around America firing employees for a living. This all goes smoothly until he falls for Alex who also flies around regularly. Vera Farmiga shines as his dream woman or as she likes to put it 'Just think of me as yourself with a vagina' so as you can imagine it isn't hard to see why he likes her.Anna Kendrick also proves to have great potential as supporting actress, she is almost as strong willed and witty as Clooney but it is Reitman's fantastic direction that makes the pace and conversation of the film so enjoyable to watch; proving his Juno phenomenon(though Diablo Cody got most the credit)wasn't mere luck. This is easily a must see of this year and easily deserves the praise it's been getting.",8,0,2,11 February 2010
The Island," Well done Michael Bay - Four words I thought I would never say.
","Like how The Lovely Bones was misapprehend critically, The Island has been misjudged as another Michael Bay misfire when in fact, until his release of the TV-series based film of Transformers (forgetting its floptastic sequel) it's clearly definable as one of the highest point of this director's career, in an otherwise roller-coaster of filmography.Though the ideas from script writers have gathered controversy for the nit-picking taken from other films/source materials (the Wachowski brothers have been looted both visually and in script) it's unoriginal reinterpretation of a future utopia shows rigorous control for a director fond of one to many explosions by not detracting from the 'Fallout 3 of an opening plot' immediately.For a summer film (back when it was released) it side steps the imperfections of a mediocre final battle of the bests' as well as the popcorn movie related dominance of detonations after the first hour for this reason.Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) has lived in his perfect utopia for three years yet is disbelieving and curious of why more survivors from the 'contamination' outside, keep being found and the knowledge that the lottery maybe fixed, which leads him and friend Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) into escaping from their haven to uncover the truth.It's not particularly close to the intellectually mind-bending action/scripting of superior sci-fi's, but for a film that didn't even earn a successful box office, hasn't come close to gathering a cult following and based bountifully among the concepts of its equals in the same genre, The Island did in it's own right fill the shoes of imaginative expectations and uses a plot which is carried firmly on the shoulders of it's two leads once its found its feet.McGregor and Johansson play off each others naivety convincingly enough to be dumbfound at the new lifestyle and imperfections of a contemporary world.It's a shame a terrible trailer which looked more like for a holiday rather than briefly highlighting the enjoyment of their relationship and story in the time it had, would have not doubt strayed viewers elsewhere (the crew should watch Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch trailer: now that's a trailer).But as far as the films goes, the misleading trailer shouldn't detach from a genuinely fun sci-fi that only causes irritation in the fact that Michael refused Scarlett Johansson to go topless as to keep a suitable rating. With slight exaggeration though, box office sales would have been more through the roof than Avatar if that had happened, not that anyone should feel bitter about it (the muppet).",6,0,1,31 July 2010
