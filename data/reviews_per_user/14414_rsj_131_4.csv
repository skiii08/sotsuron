It," Wow
","Look, I'll keep it simple. Don't listen to the idiots that score anything below 8! As an avid fan of king and the original, this was right on par. Those complaining....about ANYTHING, don't have lives and just want to get under your skin. Skarsgard 'KILLED' this role! Each 'loser' nailed their character! The dialogue alone was superb. The acting makes you sympathetic which is every actors goal! Go see it. Remember, the reviews that are scoring low should not even be viewing horror films, because IT has it all!",10,12,25,9 September 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Great
","For all of you saying Raimi Spider-Man 2 the best....?!ðŸ˜‚ You are what's wrong with efficient reviews. How can you take yourselves serious , better yet how can we take you serious?! Wow, that was by far one of the worst Spider-Man movies, second to Raimis 3rd. That whole series was awful! This is a new take just as Andrew Garfield was. But to say Spider-Man 2 was even good at all, vomit in my mouth! Worst movie ever. This is is in a new era that brings more realistic humor and fun to it. Go away all you old Spider-Man fans, you don't belong lol",9,29,53,7 July 2017
Da 5 Bloods," Da worst on netflix
","It's a shame. Lee use to make reputable movies in the 90's before he was clouded with the and reverse racism. I just , for once, wish he would make a movie that's solely about its advertised plot and not tie in oppression and racism. Got news for you, not everybody experienced racism and discrimination during Vietnam and world wars. There was real brotherhood as I myself experienced that didn't allow race or religion to come between us. You're a has-been lee. Move on and stop creating racism if you truly want it to go away.",1,10,21,12 June 2020
Alien: Covenant," Don't listen to the ignorant
","The bad reviews are fake or people that got tickets for the wrong movie. This was very well scripted and didn't just give you answers. You had to be patient and work for them. Scott figured out a way to be complex with the storyline but deliver it in a simplistic way that allows you to enjoy the movie for what it is...an awesome sci-fi action/horror flick. You cannot call yourself an original Alien fan and bad mouth this movie, it is in every way in keeping with the original series but giving way more background. What more can you ask for. Great job",9,34,67,20 May 2017
