Walk the Line," Good performances, unoriginal biopic
","I went to a screening of this movie at 'The Toronto Film Festival' in anticipation of seeing something wonderful based on all the early reviews of this film....particularly for the performance of Joaquin Phoenix. The film begins with Cash getting ready for his performance at Fulsom prison in the late 60's and we then proceed to the telling of his story with a formulaic flashback to his childhood ... proceeding thru his career, marriage and relationship with June Carter. The storytelling and direction is unoriginal. Within the confines of the story this movie was trying to tell...I felt that the director could have shown us some moments of brilliance or originality...but chose a very conventional style instead.As for the performances....Joaquin does some good acting here but for the most part a 'one note' performance. He does an admirable job at singing the Cash songs but I felt the film should have kept the original recordings since Cash had such a signature style and I found it hard to accept Joaquin singing them. I think lip-syncing like Foxx did in Ray would have worked better. The best performance of this film belongs to Reese Witherspoon. Her performance as June Carter is charming and she shines in every scene she is in. I was pleasantly surprised. I am positive she will get a nomination for an Oscar for this role and she has enough screen time for the lead category. Reese and Joaquin as Carter and Cash have a wonderful chemistry. The interaction and dialogue between these two was very enjoyable. Overall good performances in an unoriginal formulaic biopic.",5,18,67,15 September 2005
Cinderella Man," Unoriginal, melodramatic & manipulative hooey!
","I felt manipulated from beginning to end. The director and scriptwriter obviously do not respect the intelligence of their audience to manipulate us with such over the top melodrama. One example of the type of manipulation I am talking about is the scene with Crowe and the son when they are having the conversation that they will never give up their kids....and the son starts crying. Is this really necessary? They are poor, its hard times for the family....WE GET IT!!!Do we need to be hit over the head with this??I felt that so many of the elements in this film have been done before and done better in such films as 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull'. The film never tried to be bold or original in its story telling.....it seemed just geared to please Oscar members...thats all. This film does not have the originality or complexity of other films released this year and SHOULD NOT be rewarded with any kind of nominations. If it does get noms...then Ron Howard will have succeeded in manipulating AMPAS. He didn't succeed in manipulating me and based on the mixed reviews and not entirely glowing reviews by most respectable critics.....he did not manipulate critics either.",3,13,22,22 October 2005
