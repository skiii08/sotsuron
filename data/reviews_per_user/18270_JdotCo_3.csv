The Avengers," 'The Avengers' fulfills all expectations
","Minor spoilers ahead. If ever there's a movie for shedding tears of joy, this would be it. The beauty of seeing a long-term plan come to fruition has a satisfaction hard to replicate in any other fashion. That's the feeling you'll get after watching 'The Avengers'. Marvel's ambitious venture of building up a five-movie saga in anticipation of one grand epic, which ties a ribbon on those movies while simultaneously paving the way for future endeavors, not only pays huge dividends, but blows up the screen with pure amazement during the process. There's a certain awe to behold when watching montage fight scenes seamlessly transition from Captain America's ground-level assault to Iron Man's fly-by attacks to Hulk's crushing of gigantic enemies. There's a sense that they've got each other's back, that they're truly fighting as one team. That's the magic that drives 'The Avengers' to heightened plateaus of superhero storytelling. These Avengers have been assembled for this purpose and show that nothing can stop them if they work together. It's during those scenes that make you think 'This is what I've been waiting for.' Makes you feel like the kid who fell in love with these stories when first reading the comics. It's a good thing the superheroes finally start working from the same playbook, because the weight of imminent failure is lurking. Loki returns as the evil leader, and he's more power hungry and bent on world control than ever. Like any superhero movie, the bad guy's quest to control the world is at the forefront. But there's realism and a dark nature to Loki that creates a sense of peril and pressure to the task of stopping him. It requires sacrifice, something some of the Avengers need to learn. Loki is truly twisted, believing that mankind needs a ruler so it can be 'free of freedom' (it actually gets a little thought provoking). Throughout the movie, there's an unsettling feeling of the grand sinister plot, not just a gimmick that most shallow bad guys cling to. 'The Avengers' is a little darker than the other movies. Tons of destruction ensues as the scope of the grand battle covers all of Manhattan and takes casualties along the way. Even the backup plan of a nuclear missile wiping out everything comes into play. The humor that has made the characters lovable and entertaining is present and accounted for. It was a tough balancing act to get the interactions between all the superheroes to seem fitting, but director Joss Whedon concocts the perfect mixture of screen time and blends all the superheroes together brilliantly. Yes, tensions even arise as Iron Man and Thor duke it out. From Nick Fury giving Hulk the order to smash to Tony Stark calling Coulson by his first name, 'Agent', there's plenty of laughs from everyone, none of which are contrived (okay, some are, but not any more than any of the other Marvel films, which is a good thing). During some of those interactions, a lot is learned about the superheroes. There's some back story for Black Widow and Hawkeye that was sorely needed. Bruce Banner has some moments in the sun (side note: Edward Norton was a better Banner, but Mark Ruffalo did a good job). Captain America steps up to be the leader he was meant to be. At times, it seemed like the movie could (and maybe even should've) piggy back on anyone of these stories and flesh it out a little more, but Whedon did a good job of keeping the movie's somewhat broad focus on target. Special effects were top-notch. The art design of enemies for the final battle was creative and organic. Music was stellar. Actually, it was cool when the musical theme would get switched up a little depending on which superhero was fighting at that particular moment. Indeed, the long wait was worth it. 'The Avengers' reaches its potential and brings out the giddiness and excitement we've all had for these superhero movies. One last note: There are two end-of-credit scenes, so stay all the way through. One gives a glimpse of what is to come in future movies (there'd better be more of them) and the other is simply a perfect capper.",10,1,4,9 May 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise of the Planet of the Apes: No animals were used during the making of this film
","*Spoilers are in this review*Not only is 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' a modestly great reboot of a franchise that desperately needed it, but it also was a big step forward in the CGI world. Caesar and the rest of his ape teammates were created using flawless digital work from the mind of Andy Serkis, who used motion-capture technology to play the role of the ape leader. It absolutely worked in bringing realistic facial expressions and movements to light. From hand-to-hand combat to roaming free in the jungles, this is one of the finest uses of CGI to date. In fact, that seemed to be the theme with 'Rise' throughout the film: realism. The story centers on the work of a scientist who searches for the cure to Alzheimer's disease. Instead, he discovers a serum that heightens intelligence to unprecedented levels. Of course, this was most prevalently evident with Caesar, who became more than an ape who understands voice tones and a few simple signs. He learns to communicate with the scientist (Will Rodman, played by James Franco). Caesar even begins to understand his place his society, which is little more than a pet who needs to be kept on a leash. And therein lays the conflict. Caesar's emotional outbursts lead to exile, a seemingly low-brow asylum for apes. From there, Caesar, in a sense, starts plotting his path to freedom, and he brings his fellow prison mates with him – and teaches them a thing or two along the way. But the true beauty of the story is how closely we become attached to Caesar. Reality tells us that, yes, he's just an ape, and apes have their place. That may be true, but it's startling how emotional it is when Caesar shows how he feels betrayed by Rodman. And how sorrowful he looks to be tamed and mistreated when placed with apes of much lower intelligence (that includes the humans who run the place, too). In one scene, he uses chalk to draw a picture of a window that he used to stare through back at his home, and it's touching to see just how badly he wishes to be there one more time. The rest of the cast serves more as a function than it does an integral part of the movie. That's not a bad thing, either. The story and development of Caesar is at the forefront, and that's the way it needed to be. In fact, it's fulfilling when a prequel/re-imagining of a prequel gets it right. Caesar's rise seamlessly leads into the saga of the Apes movies. In fact, after discussing with my father, it actually mixes up a little of what we know in regards to how the apes take over. Sure, there's going to be a war, but during the credits, it's shown that the virus that was used to make the apes more intelligent – which has adverse effects on humans – spreads throughout the world, both infecting more and more people and apes alike. This isn't to suggest that there isn't a war, but the virus becomes a serious concern for humans (though not in the degree of, say, a 'Resident Evil' or '28 Days Later' virus. The movie makes several references to the saga, including the classic 'Get your hands off me, you damn dirty ape' line that actually seemed out of place considering it was said during a somewhat serious moment. Still, the film as a whole had a plan, and executed it quite nicely.Score: 7/10",Null,0,4,9 August 2011
Friends with Benefits," 'Friends With Benefits' a worthy rom-com
","(There's a couple of mild spoilers in this review, but nothing too bad).I have a theory on this one. During their time on the set of 'Black Swan', Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman talked to each other about making identical movies. They probably even had a little contest between each other on which one would have the better movie. Portman thought she and Ashton Kutcher would be perfect together and it would be a can't-miss flick. Thus, 'No Strings Attached' was made. Not a great movie, though better than most gave it credit for. Portman was still good. She did as good a job with that one as anyone else could've done. Kunis liked her chances with Justin Timberlake. And six months later, we got 'Friends with Benefits.' Kunis definitely won the bet. 'Friends with Benefits' outdid its predecessor in several ways and turned out to be a quite the charmer. The movie had zippier dialogue and funnier jokes (though nothing was as funny as the period mix in 'No Strings Attached'). Kunis and Timberlake demanded screen time together with a charming chemistry that produced moments of joy, sorrow, attraction, reservation, hurt and betrayal.It might be shocking to say, but Timberlake actually played the part. Seldom did I feel like it was just Timberlake reciting lines and singing (yes, he sings a little bit). He actually came across as a guy who was really trying to figure things out and learning how to handle adversity when it came his way. The premise of the movie was simple. Jamie (Kunis) is a recruiting shark who convinces Dylan (Timberlake) to move to New York and take a big job at GQ magazine. As Jamie woos Dylan, they start to open up to each other and realize they want the same thing at this particular point in their lives: sex without the emotional attachment that comes from relationships. Sound simple enough? Of course not. Sure, they both enjoy the physicality of this endeavor, but eventually, things get too close for comfort. As they threaten to cross the threshold from sex partners to being a couple, true feelings throw a curve ball into the mix, and now they're left sorting out the mess. What makes 'Friends with Benefits' work is how the characters change their approach through the course of the story. Kunis gets hurt, and it shows. Timberlake gets bitter for a little bit, and it shows. It also helped that when trouble arose, there actually were sorrowful, emotional moments off of which they played. The bad stuff that happened in 'No Strings Attached' just felt like the next step in the movie. In 'Friends with Benefits', Dylan's father, Mr. Harper (Richard Jenkins), had physical issues that truly left a mark on Dylan. Though a bit predictable, his father's predicament gave him a better perspective of his own situation, which, in turn, helps both him and Jamie. The rest of the supporting cast rounded the movie nicely. Woody Harrelson plays Tommy, a co-worker of Dylan's who is gay, and is convinced Dylan is gay, or least tries to convince Dylan of this. Jenna Elfman plays Dylan's sister, who thinks he and Jamie are perfect for each other and enjoys talking about her brother to Jamie (where has Elfman been, and why has she only been in two movies the last seven years? She deserves more work). The story ends in a typical cliché rom-com way (actually, there's a scene at the end of the credits, which I'm proud to say that, out of the 75 or so people who came at the same showing, I was only one who got to watch it). But even that seemed fitting for the story. Whether it was the solid delivery of the lines or just quick style by which they were delivered, 'Friends with Benefits' just clicked.",Null,0,2,11 August 2011
