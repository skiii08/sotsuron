Deja Vu," Fifteen minutes too long
","This would have been a great movie if it ended 15 minutes before it does. The obviously tacked on 'happy ending' not only violates a fundamental narrative precept if the plot but also contains the only 'idiot plot' moment in an otherwise tight,inventive and we'll written script.My sympathies are with the original screen writer as I am sure this is another Brazil.",5,0,1,6 August 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Ridiculous and sublime. like opera
","MM:Fury Road has no pretenses of being anything other then what it is, a non-stop, over the top, completely ludicrous thrill ride and very possibly the longest continuous car chase ever filmed. With the early establishment that the enemy warriors travel with their own engine-enabled rock band Miller makes it clear that you are supposed to just suspend any hopes of plausibility and come along for the ride. And if you do that, its a great one.The movie does make some brave moves. It dares to open with an easily defeated and clearly insane version of Max. Its a rare movie where the title character spends his first 30 min of movie time as a helpless victim.In many ways, however, this movie isn't really about him. He is just the traveler, traveling through the situation while what plot and character growth there is all centers around those actually in the situation. And if Miller wants to make this a franchise, that might be a good way to go. Make Max the perpetual outsider/observer and let the stories be about the situations he discovers as he travels.If you are looking for deep story or characters though this isn't your movie. If what you are looking for is goofy high octane violent spectacle, the movie delivers in spades.",8,3,10,15 May 2015
