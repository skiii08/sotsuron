Raiders of the Lost Ark," Dynamic 2 hours of cinematic magic.
","I've heard various comments in recent years of how Schindler's List is Spielberg maturing as a director. But in reality he matured in 1975 with Jaws, which along with Close Encounters, Raiders, and ET are the director at the very peak of his powers. Schindler, although superb, appears to be the director trying a little too hard to be serious and adult. Raiders is as 'adult' as any film you're likely to see in its remarkably sophisticated technique and mastery of audience manipulation, which along with Jaws even tops Hitch in this area. Spielbergs visual flair is astounding at times in this film, the natural fluidity of camera work and the perfect use of light, particularly in facial lighting is brilliant. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a genuine cinematic masterpiece and will gain this status over time.",9,0,0,4 September 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Very,very,very,very,very,very,very silly but smashing too..
",A thunderous clashing of avant garde and slapstick.  A remarkable - nay - astonishing tribute to silliness and at the same time being a gritty (in the Great British tradition) comment on mud collecting. The best python film and John Cleese is a comic genius. So there.,Null,0,0,4 September 1999
