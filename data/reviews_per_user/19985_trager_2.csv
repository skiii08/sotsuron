E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Pure magic!
",Christmas 1982. The hype has reached the UK big time. It's impossible to avoid it in magazines or on the TV or radio. Buy the soundtrack - John Williams finest work. The final statement of the theme in all its glory is magnificent. Get tickets for the Sunday morning premiere at the Birmingham Odeon. Watch the movie. Pure magic. 17 years later my perspective has changed a little. I still see the movie as an almost perfect example of film-making but some of the deeper issues now affect me more deeply - in particular the mother's rejection of the ailing alien. What makes me categorize this as a classic is that whenever I see an image or hear an excerpt of the soundtrack it brings back the emotions and sensations I had as I watched this beautiful story unfold before my eyes on that Sunday morning in December 1982 and remembered what it was like to be a child.,10,1,2,21 November 1999
American Beauty," Is this film 'It's A Wonderful Life' for our generation?
",This is a truly provocative movie. It challenges us to take a fresh look at society and more specifically the class/capitalist/materialistic system that most of us accept as the norm. Where it has polarised critics in this country I sense genuine fear from those that 'do not' like the film that the creature comforts they have slaved so tirelessly for may not provide them with the truly deep answers that they seek.Materialism clearly is not the answer. Do not settle for what is expected of you. Be happy.A truly stunning debut from Alan Mendes and a deeply moving performance from Kevin Spacey. I will never forget his final monologue or the imagery which accompanied it.Is this film 'It's A Wonderful Life' for our generation?,10,0,0,3 February 2000
