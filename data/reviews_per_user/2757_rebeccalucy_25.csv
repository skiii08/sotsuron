The Sound of Music," Obviously a classic....
","A great musical with beautiful songs! Julie Andrews is a fantastic singer and actor, and it is fun to see her in her younger years. I don't believe the film would be as good without her, she is perfectly suited to the role. Most of the child acting is decent, which can usually really impact a film.The songs are absolutely classics and for a good reason. All further the story and fit, and they must have great song writers. Also, the settings are phenomenal with the mountain being iconic scenery now. Costumes are very nice, and reflect the mood of the scenes. However, the cinematography is basic but I think it is mainly due to the time period and equipment. Just overall an amazing classic that everyone has watched or needs to!",9,3,3,5 December 2017
It," Great update!
","Probably one of my favourite horror films, I know it isn't that scary but I genuinely enjoyed the whole thing. I had little expectations going in but loved it! Most of the child actors were great, which is really hard to do. They perfectly balanced the comedy with the horror elements. I felt sympathy for all of them, and the bullies were terrifying. Not just the stereotypical bullies shown in most films and Georgie was just adorable.Most of the cinematography is pretty and scary, cramming spooky details into the background. Pennywise's costume was a great update and his makeup was phenomenal. The CGI is very good as well. So excited for the next one, definitely give it a watch.",8,1,2,11 November 2017
Shaun of the Dead," Fun mixing of genres...
","A lot of fun and unique, with a lot of good editing and cinematography. Obviously a lot of effort went into this film! The acting was very good and really brought the film to life, just wouldn't be the same with Simon Pegg or Nick Frost. However, Frost's character (Ed) can be extremely unlikable despite adding humour. It can be hard to understand why Shaun let's him ruin his life, but adds to Pegg's character once he stands up to him. The makeup and effects are very timeless and will probably never age. When a certain character dies it is extremely gruesome and silly all at once. Stands out from many other typical zombie films!",7,1,2,10 March 2018
Green Room," Scary but can be hard to watch...
","This is probably one of most terrifying films I have seen this year, but it is extremely graphic. I was extremely interested in the premise, but for most this will be quite hard watch due to the violence.I was absolutely horrified throughout, which is a good quality for a horror. Patrick Steward gave a very good performance, being very quiet despite the horrible actions he commits. All of the Neo-Nazis were very scary, keeping me on the edge of my seat. However, I personally feel I will not be able to re-watch the film due to the gore. Also, I wish they developed the band a little more in the beginning. Definitely not a film for everyone, due to the intense gore. But is immensely scary, with chilling characters.",5,0,4,9 December 2017
500 Days of Summer," Unique and heart-warming
","Very beautiful, heart-warming and realistic. A twist in the romantic comedy genre with well rounded characters. The main character Tom is kinda arrogant, but is still extremely likable. This is a definite sign of good character development.All of the acting was good, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel were believable. They often gave a few laughs in the way they portray the characters. Certain techniques add to the comedy or are just unique/fun. My favourite editing technique was the expectation versus reality split screen. The narrative structure was interesting, linking certain days with others. It doesn't confuse the audience due to the constant transitions to the day number. I like the use of this technique, it really subverts the romantic comedy genre. A must see for lovers of any film genre!",7,1,1,27 November 2017
Deadpool 2," Really fun!
","Extremely fun and comedic all throughout, being a great update on the first. Ryan Reynolds brings so much into this role and it would not be the same without him. Has some good cinematography, it is a bit more experimental than the other one. The jokes are well timed and keep up with the fast pace. However, the marketing seems to give far too much away in terms of jokes. Sometimes it goes a little over the top with the self-referential humour but that's expected for the character. Also, it manages to break from the typical formula in a particular way which is quite good/unexpected. Definitely worth a watch for fans of the series.",8,3,6,18 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A great marvel film!
","There are some beautiful shots and colours in this film! Especially a slow scene with the Valkyrie girl, just visually stunning. The poster for this film being one of my favourites of the year.This one contains a lot more action and comedy, similar in tone to guardians of the galaxy. Could be considered a good or bad thing but I liked it. Furthermore some minor characters like Heimdall are expanded upon, which is great because I really enjoy his character. However you need to be a marvel fan to understand some scenes, don't watch this if it is your first as you may be confused. It moves quite fast in the beginning but gradually the pace gets a bit better. Overall I would hold this in high regard, just under Captain America: civil war and The Avengers.",7,61,112,29 October 2017
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Amazing satire....
","Hyperbolic fun, with strange characters to highlight the point. Has a unique story that is executed very well and tries to show what could possibly happen if nuclear weapons were used.I enjoyed the characters of Buck and Mandrake, both are unlike any other characters I have seen before. Buck has a great delivery of lines with his booming voice whereas Mandrake has a likable charm. The president was very interesting too, his conversations on the phone are so absurd they become funny. However, sometimes I found it a little hard to follow the plot.The editing and cinematography are very good too, with a large long shot that is contrasted with an extreme close up later. This highlights the tension between the characters and is key to the understanding of the film. Overall, a great satire with great cinematography.",7,2,2,4 December 2017
Tangled," A great Disney film...
","Tangled is a beautifully animated film, the lantern scene being absolutely stunning. It can also be used to create fast paced comedy and action. Flynn Rider is one of the best Disney princes, as he has a fun personality that develops throughout the film. The animation allows for some fun expressions between him and Rapunzel, unlike past ones.I think the story is very thought out, giving reasons for Rapunzel to grow out her hair and why Mother Gothel wants her in the first place. It could have been really easy to phone in the plot, but a lot of time went into it. Furthermore, Maximus as the comedic relief is great. He doesn't need to talk to be funny, they allow him to have unique expressions. However, the songs are quite good but don't always further the story. Sometimes they can be a little distracting or take away from the plot. The villain is quite threatening but sometimes needs to be developed a little bit more. In conclusion, a great Disney film with beautiful animation. But could use a little tweaking to make it fantastic!",7,1,1,10 December 2017
Fargo," Interesting...
","Quite interesting and different in its execution, with a unconventional setting. Having a snowy setting in a murder mystery really added a layer of strangeness. The acting is great, Frances McDormand is cheery and a good female protagonist. Some of the effects look really convincing and very disturbing towards the end of the film. Also, the accents are my my favourite part.",7,0,0,13 March 2018
The Shining," Phenomenal!
","Such a phenomenal horror, definitely not over-rated! I absolutely loved the music in this film as it would not be as tension filled without. The hotel set was eerie and unnerving throughout, with great props that really created the atmosphere.The editing and cinematography was carefully planned and adds to the horror themes. Some of the sudden zooms caught me off guard and I liked the shot that focused on Jack's face as he gradually becomes worse. All of the acting was amazing, I felt genuinely scared for both Danny and Wendy. Jack was terrifying as he deteriorates and attacks his family. His actor deserves the praise he gets, I don't believe the film would be as great without him. Overall, it is expertly directed, acted and edited with fantastic music. A must see classic for any film fan!",10,1,3,20 November 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Absolutely amazing! Must watch!
","A fantastic sequel, as I did not even see the first and perfectly understood what was going on! The practical effects were amazing and still hold up today. Action scenes were extremely tense and gripping! Most had me on the edge of my seat. My favourite scene was the climax as I truly felt worried for Sarah Connor as the scene pushes her to the absolute limits. The opening credits were so unique and interesting, with the flames rising. I will eventually watch the first as this one interested me so much. Highly recommend if you haven't seen it.",9,1,3,9 November 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fantastic visuals and ideas...
","An absolutely beautiful experience, with amazing visuals! Edgar Wright and his team cleary put a lot of effort into the editing/cinematography. Each scene is packed with little jokes or small features that really add to the film. I don't think I can even name a film with a similar style. The acting is quite good, most of the actors manage to pull off some truly strange dialogue very well. However, sometimes I feel the editing can be a little confusing. At the beginning I felt I had to really pay close attention to every detail to understand whether the character was dreaming or not. Wright definitely perfected this style of editing in his future films. The visuals and effects are my personal favourite part of the film, being the thing I will return to the film for. Certainly worth a watch for videogame and film fans!",7,0,0,20 January 2018
Bridesmaids," Really good!
","A genuinely funny comedy that can be a little conventional, but it definitely worth a watch. The focusing on a unique group of women- each allowing for some great comedy- which works really well together. Usually it would be over the top or dull, but it just works here. Furthermore, the plot is not very conventional; there were certain plot points I thought they would hit but they broke away from quite a few. However, they still stick to some convetions and sometimes don't really expand upon them. Some of the cinematography and editing is not very experimental. It doesn't try too much in this regard, but sometimes that can be good for a film.",7,1,2,23 April 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Extremely entertaining!
","Beautiful and very unique event, from beginning to end. Definitely requires knowledge of the marvel universe to even have a grasp of what is going on. The action is fantastic and completely break-taking at points. Josh Brolin does a fantastic job with Thanos, becoming one of the best parts of the entire film. Some of the shots involing him were phenomenal, being so interesting to look at. Everybody has a fantastic energy; they all give a great performance and bounce of each other. Such a fun experience and definitely worth a watch for all fans!",9,1,4,18 May 2018
A Quiet Place," A good thriller/horror
","An interesting experience but possibly required to see in an empty cinema or alone. It is extremely experimental but also sticks to quite a few conversations at the same time. The acting was good, with all the actors having to rely on facial expressions and body language. The child actors are either hit or miss but aren't too noticeable. Sometimes the monsters are terrifying and other times they are just bland. I really enjoy the use of silence in the film, it is so refreshing. However, a cinema setting can be quite hard to remain quiet in as any sound is emphasised. Worth a look once it's on DVD.",6,2,4,9 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Fun and beautiful...
","Looks absolutely beautiful, with great cinematography. Obviously had a lot of thought put into the costumes, editing and lighting. Star Wars always has opportunities to show fantastic locations on screen. The acting was very good as well. All the new characters are extremely likable, Kylo ren and Rey in particular. They are definitely played to be antitheses of each other, which is a unique idea. However, again characters like Captain Phasma and General Hux are very under used. They are both interesting but are never given time to be developed. Sometimes the plot is a little strange, mostly the casino scene, but it is saved by other scenes. The comedy can be very good, it can go a bit over the top. Overall, a very fun film with great cinematography and editing!",7,1,4,30 December 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A fantastic blending of genres...
","Such a beautiful romance and Sci-fi blend, and has excellent performances. Definitely worth a watch for anyone! It has amazing cinematography and editing, which is not conventional for romantic films. I'm glad this team put a lot of effort into this side of the film. Furthermore, Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet have a unique chemistry that really works. You can definitely see how they can have problems but bring out another side to each other. The effects are also very good, and still hold up quite well. Just a fantastic film all together!",9,0,0,26 February 2018
La La Land," One of the best looking musicals!
","Absolutely beautiful and colourful! Such a joy to look at, with popping colours and stylish costumes. A lot of effort when into every single shot, which I fully appreciate.The music is phenomenal with City of stars being my new favourite song from a musical. I thought there would be more songs but the ones in the film are so catchy and upbeat. Both Emma and Ryan did great jobs with the singing and acting, each making the characters feelings come alive.It also uses cinematography fantastically, my favourite shot being the powerful audition scene. The sky effect is very beautiful, love the purplish night dance scene. So excited for my next watch of it!",10,3,3,1 December 2017
Pulp Fiction," Is an extremely unique film but a must watch!
","Tarantino creates a fantastic experience with interesting characters, twists and a breaking conventions of other films. He uses cinematography to demonstrate meaning in the film, as well as to just show great shots. Has some dark and disturbing scenes, but they keep you interested in the situation. All actors are fantastic and stick to the tone of the film really well. Both points help to keep you sympathetic to some quite horrible characters. Not once was I able to guess where the film was going, which deserves a lot of praise. A must watch for any film fan.",9,0,2,29 October 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Beautiful and dynamic!
","Beautifully heart-warming and unique, being an superior to the original film!James Gunn clearly put a lot of thought and time into the film, as did most of the actors. The character dynamics work very well and are improved from the first film. Also, the effects are amazing and create a unique style. It just looks very interesting to look at, with each frame trying something new. Some of the themes the film touches on can be a bit cliché but are done very well. The ending in particular is extremely sweet. Overall a great film, plus baby Groot is so cute!",8,0,0,29 April 2018
The Shape of Water," A beautiful romance...
","Absolutely gorgeous and a classic spin on the beauty and the beast type fairytales. It has a great style and setting that allows for a romantic look to the past. The makeup for the creature is fantastic and makes him both frightening and lovable once the relationship grows. All the acting is very good, with Sally Hawkins adding a lot of personality to a mute character. Octavia Spencer was great too, adding some light comedy with her whit. All of the cinematography allows the film to dwell on the beautiful set and characters. It also lets the characters to feel closer together. Del Toro really added his personality and auteur style to the film, the film would not be the same without him!",9,29,52,15 February 2018
Straight Outta Compton," Decent...
","A interesting look into the band and the many struggles it faced. However, it's debatable if the film is completely accurate or not. Has some good editing but not much unique cinematography, just rather conventional. The settings and lighting were very well done however; it has some very thoughtful locations that really add to the immersion. Some of the scenes are very well executed and extremely memorable. Most of the actors were quite good and look similar to the actual performers. The themes it focuses on were powerful and really added a deep layer to the film. However, the portrayal of women is awful. There are either completely objectified or absent through most of the film. It can be quite degrading watching how they are shown.",5,0,0,15 March 2018
The Greatest Showman," Pure fun...
","A fun musical with some great songs. It also uses unique editing and cinematography quite well. The cast were definitely the best part of the film, with Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron giving very believable performances. The supporting cast were quite good as well, particularly Keala Settle's amazing voice! The editing is quite good for the musical genre, the first scene being the best example of this. Furthermore, the sets and costumes are beautiful. Truly capturing the style of the film. However, sometimes I feel the moral is quite heavy handed. It can be too much and the audience understand it from the beginning. Sometimes the CGI was a little distracting also, but can be forgotten with the practical effects. Definitely worth a watch for musical fans!",7,5,11,14 February 2018
The Birds," Great horror with amazing direction...
","Very atmospheric and unique, and actually manages to make birds frightening! It really represents the 1960s style, with the fashion and acting. The acting is quite good, Tippi Hedren being the best of all. She had a fun chemistry with Rod Taylor despite them not being shown together a lot. Some of the effects are dated but others are fantastic, such as the man with his eyes covered in blood. Hitchcock's directing is of course amazing.Definitely a good Hitchcock film to start with, and would really recommend for any film lover.",8,1,2,29 January 2018
