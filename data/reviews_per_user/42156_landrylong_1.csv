Casablanca," My most favorite movie...
","The reason that this movie lists as my most favorite movie is that 'Rick' is very much like a real person: a little cynical, rather practical, and even a tiny bit 'the romantic'. And despite his identification as a jaded and possibly bitter person from a past relationship, he does the one thing that I hope I, and more people, can do someday. He shows that true love is unselfish.I certainly do not expect everyone to appreciate my singular view of this movie. But I believe the things we take from a movie (besides the aesthetics) are the ideas and images it presents to its viewers. These are the things we compare and contrast in our own lives.",10,0,2,19 February 2006
