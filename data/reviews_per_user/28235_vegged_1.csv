Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Even better than Vol. 1
","What can I say?  Vol. 1 was awesome, but Vol. 2 is even better!  Tarantino is a genius filmmaker and this movie is another masterpiece, perhaps even surpassing (dare I say?) Pulp Fiction.  Vol. 2 is not as cinematic as Vol. 1 but it ties up all the lose strings and questions of the first movie and it does so in a very unpredictable way.  We all know that the bride is out for her revenge, but there are many twists and turns along the way that I never saw coming.  I don't know what it is, but Tarantino has a way of getting great performances out of his cast.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great cast, but I've never seen them better than in this movie.  The long stretches of diologue between the action is fantastic, due largely to great writing and great performances.  It's all very entertaining and gripping.It's been a long time since Jackie Brown, but it was certainly worth the wait.  If this is what we can expect from Mr. Tarantino then I'm willing to wait seven years between pictures.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
