Your Name.," Unforgettable
","May I ask you a favor?Please boycott the inevitable American remake. I know that Kimi No Na Wa made a lot of money so therefore I know automatically that the remake will come and it will be a Hollywood con job (think Ghost In The Shell SHUDDER).Kimi No Na Wa to me is an extremely well written and well thought story with amazing visuals. The bond between the characters, even in animation was something else. It was beautiful.The world does not need an American remake.",9,104,109,1 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I do not believe in god
","But I will become a calm and compliant believer if someone somehow frees Star Wars from the clutch of Disney. This was awful. Sordid. Stinky. Wretched. My wife and I did not wait to see who is the director until the end of the film. I got up and checked out the back of the DVD to find out. The film did not improve (actually got worse) and I am here now hecking out what else the man J.J. Abrams has done.
He is on our total avoid list!
The film smacked of marketing department approved trash all the way. Oh it was so cool 2019. I am being totally sarcastic. Wow. Give it up, Disney and Mr. Abrams.
I am older than 7 so cannot like this film.",1,18,25,1 April 2019
