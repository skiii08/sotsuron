Sucker Punch," So many great elements lumped together in an awful film
","I hardly ever write reviews on here, because I almost never read them. I'm not sure why the opinion of some faceless nobody I know nothing about should have any sway in my choice of films. This, however, has moved to write something about it.I missed seeing this film at the cinema for various reasons and deeply regretted it. In its favour, it looks amazing, the cast is great and there's so much style in the directing it's incredible.It is, however, in my opinion, the worst film I have ever seen. And I've sat through Troll 2, Manos: The Hands of Fate and many other notorious films.This film has three sections:1. The mental asylum. This hardly features in the film at all. Which is a shame, because what we see of it looks interesting.2. A nightclub/brothel. The nearest the film gets to being interesting, but because it's so poorly set up and used it just gets dull and tedious.3. Large scale action sequences. They look great. The trouble is they are pointless and feel more like padding than anything else. It's like somebody had a bunch of great ideas for fight scenes and chucked them in at random. Pretty much anything can happen in these sequences, which is fun at first, but then becomes tedious as you realise any massive obstacle can be overcome.And the ending? The air is still echoing with the swearing the ending produced. All it did was confirm what seemed obvious all along (the nightclub/brothel being an invention of the main character that replaced the asylum in her mind - meaning, it made even less sense and we spent have the film watching fantasies with in a fantasy.)It also meant that no genuine problems were dealt with. Minor characters supposedly killed by armed guards in the nightclub/brothel should still be alive. And, worst of all, the attack on the main character that starts the film has no pay-off or resolution. The character that does best out of this film is the abusive stepfather.I like films that are a bit different. I also need some substance, characters to care about and a central plot that's involving - or at least makes enough sense to care about. This film had none of those elements. I'm sure some stills from it would look great on my wall, but that's not enough for a movie.",1,4,8,9 August 2011
