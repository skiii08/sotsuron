Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas must have been high
","All I have to say is what was Lucas thinking when he created Jar Jar Binks? And don't even say that stupid little creature was there for the kiddies, cause every little kid I know hated Binks. This movie is more like Toy Story than Star Wars, I mean jeez! talk about an over-reliance on CGI. Lucas, you did it in the 70's and early 80's, why can't you do it now. Oh well, guess they don't make SFX like they used to... as for the characters, (the real ones, yes I know, there aren't many) no one really cares about them. I admit, Qui Gon was cool, and I really liked Darth Maul, but that little kid is just too cutesy to be a future Darth Vader. Haley Joel Osment would have been better, he's a better actor anyway. Obi-Wan is pretty stupid. Most of the movie he just follows Qui Gon around asking dumb questions. The Saber fights are cool but don't have the emotion that the older ones had. Hey, look, it's some guy with face paint and a lightsaber...let's fight him! Luke vs. Vader was the ultimate. One more thing, and someone said it before but it hit me when i first saw this...the technology in this movie far surpasses the original three, yet this one takes place 30 years before hand! Did inventors get MORE retarded as time went on or something? oh well, I stated my opinion. (4 out of 10)",Null,0,1,9 August 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Take a deep breath and say...This movie doesn't exist.
","Take a deep breath and say...This movie doesn't exist. Don't you feel better? No matter how many good points you can pile up about this movie, it just doesnt fit in the series, and I would rather ignore it, reffering to the Alien movies as a trilogy. The first was a masterpiece, the second will blow you away, even the third, if weakest (of the trilogy) still is fascinating and quite entertaining,and a fitting ending to the mighty trilogy (...this is Ripley, signing off.) Than there came Alien Ressurection. Jeez, for one thing, it's not even Ripley anymore, it's a dumb clone! Another, the Newborn!! Oh, God!! It is so stupid looking and more pathetic than terrifying. When it was born, people in the theater were actually laughing out loud (no joke, I even found me chuckling to myself.) How did H.R. Giger allow this to happen??? It is a hideous freak of nature that kills the mighty queen in one swipe!! I have to say, the scene that Ripley sees 1-7 reject clones is first-class filmmaking and a masterpiece scene, but cannot save the fact that this is no more than a cash in on the Alien Trilogy. Even when watching the other Alien movies now, I can't help but have a bad taste in my mouth knowing how it all ends up, which is why I don't consider this part of the Alien series. The trilogy is great storytelling that fits in seamlessly, and admit it, you didn't wanna see Ripley die, but come on, let's be realistic. After three encounters with the beast, it is unbelievable that she would survive (as it is amazing that she simply survived the first time!) while if Ressurection is ignored you will be happier.

Alien," Normal People In Insane Situations
","As fast as George Lucas made space seem fun and exciting, Alien made it hostile and claustrophobic. No one knew that birds could be our arch enemies until Hitchcock. No one believed of a 25 foot White Shark prowling your coast until Spielberg. And no one knew how terrifying space could be until Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger showed us the 'Alien.' One thing that makes this movie seem so real is the characters, who seem like you and me. For instance, the first conversation in the movie is a discussion over contracts and fair shares of money. Unlike Alien's many ripoffs, these aren't gung-ho space cowboys; they are normal people that just want to be paid and go home. This is what makes you care when they die. *Spoilers Ahead* One ingenius thing I think Scott did with this movie is the body count. All but one character is killed off. Obviously, people are gonna die in a movie like this, but after awhile people start to think 'uh...wait a minute. That's a bit much, how many are left now?' And when Ripley is left alone, you too, feel alone in the Nostromo, which makes it seem so scary. The alien design itself is amazing, and makes the movie work. You can't be that dramatic in showing the alien little by little unless you have an alien that is so unique that it is actually worth waiting till the end to see it. H.R. Giger has quite an imagination. The special effects, although maybe not as flashy as, say, Star Wars, are effective and amazing. Sigourney Weaver gives a very good performance as does the rest of the cast, more specifically Yaphett Koto and whoever played Ash. James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' most definitly equals this movie, and is surprisingly inventive for a sequel, but the original is the one that started it all. I highly reccomend seeing the entire trilogy (yes the trilogy) and leave 'Ressurection' alone (I covered that more in my review of Ressurection). I give this a 8/10 for inventiveness, darkness, and suspense.",Null,0,1,28 August 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," You have got to be kidding me
","I am an artist, I have an open mind and I am creative. But you can't be serious when you consider this a good movie, let alone a work of art!!! I am also into sci fi, so I was very eager to rent this movie oneday and watch it, but it is so stupid and pointless it is mind-boggling that such a wonderful director could decieve so many people into thinking of this as...good! I am sorry if I am being stubborn, but I don't really enjoy watching a spaceship take 15 minutes to go from one side of the screen to another, and than watch someone jog around a loop for another 10 minutes, and than watch a big block of rock floating through space. It is so incredibly boring. Kinda like Matrix-style, except the whole movie is in bullet-time!!  And this is supposed to influence me or something? The meaning of life?? HAL 9000 was pretty cool, and the beginning with the apes was fascinating, but the rest is pure, 100% distilled crap. Face it, if someone is looking for art they go to a museum. If they are looking for an entertaining movie, they go to the silver screen. 2001 is neither, and doesn't belong in either place.",Null,1,3,25 October 2001
Titanic," The Academy must be out of their mind
","Let me get one thing straight...James Cameron is a great directer, but this is entirely uncharacteristic of his types of movies. He should stick with what he made famous, and that is the sci-fi/action genre. Titanic is such a sugar-coated load of crap...not only is it painful on the eyes, it is painful on the ears with that godawful song by Celine Dione. At over 3 hours, it is simply gruelling to watch. Leo DiCaprio is a terrible actor who looked about 5 or 6 years younger than he actuall is. Kate Winslet is talented, but this talent is wasted. The movie doesnt know whether it wants to be a teenie-bopper chick flick or an action movie, and the bizarre transition from one to another is even worse. I have watched many movies that top the 3 hour mark that I have thoroughly enjoyed (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Terminator 2) but these movies use the length to benefit the story, while Titanic simply uses it as an excuse for more explosions, more soggy dialog and an excuse for Winslet to get naked. I am not bias to the love story genre, but this just takes it to a new level of badness. How it won best picture is beyond me. 4/10 stars (I admit I have seen worse)",5,1,2,25 January 2002
