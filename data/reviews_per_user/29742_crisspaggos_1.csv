First Man," DON't MISS A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE!
","Sound. The first thing I noticed that this film has brilliance in. From defeaning engines to complete silence. The art direction, cinematography, and of course directing. The whole cast does their job and then more. Damien Chazelle shows you the life of Neil Armstrong, and brings you to the moon with him in a phenomenally, visually captivating and stunning way. His whole arts team has nailed it again and are quite the group. Gosling has his Oscar nomination and I believe win with a role he's never played before. The rest of the cast doesn't get as much attention as you'd think. Don't miss a lifetime experience. See this in IMAX.",9,15,44,6 October 2018
