Blade Runner 2049," Sigh
","I was really looking forward to this film - being a fan of the original. The pacing is completely off and the plot isn't particularly interesting. The only appeal is the costumes, set designs and CGI.",6,2,4,17 October 2018
The Incredible Hulk," Average
","I'm not a hater of this film, I just didn't think it was that good. Maybe it was the casting. I feel like Edward Norton wasn't the ideal choice.",6,0,2,17 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mediocre
","This film was quite mediocre. It did not revive the series at all, even though it was a prequel. The acting and writing were poor. Not compelling to watch at all.",5,0,3,15 October 2018
Argo," Loved it!
","This was a fun film to watch, with some very tense moments. I was shocked to find out later it's based on a true story!",9,0,1,17 October 2018
Life of Pi," Ok
",It was ok but overly sentimental and not at all as good as the book. I think it was decent and plucked those emotional strings at the right time. Wouldn't watch it again. Would rather get the book out.,6,1,1,15 October 2018
Man of Steel," Mediocre
",It wasn't terrible but I'm finding a lot of the newer superhero films just haven't done justice to the originals. The score and CGI were the main appeals. The pacing was slow and the villain was not compelling.,6,0,3,17 October 2018
A Clockwork Orange," Classic film
",This film is disturbing even in the modern times. A tough watch. I can see how it was controversial at the time yet films like this now are standard fare! It's still chilling to watch even now.,10,2,3,15 October 2018
Titanic," Best film of the 90s
",I loved this film. I've watched it 10 times and cry each time. It really takes you back to the 90s through its writing style and cinematography then you're transported back to the beginning of the 20th century to a tragedy that will be forever remembered.,10,2,4,15 October 2018
Black Panther," Great film
","Loved the soundtrack, the acting was on point. Really glad to see African Americans at the forefront of a superhero film",8,0,3,17 October 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Average
","I watched this on the plane and glad I spent my time on the plane watching this film. If i'd watched it at the cinema I would have felt ripped off. The plot, acting and pacing are just not right. Of course plenty of CGI and action scene to keep the superhero flick fan interested.",5,0,4,17 October 2018
Speed," What happened to Keanu?
",This film was awesome! Definitely one of those cult classics that will stick with you for the rest of your life. Such a unique premise and such a suspenseful film.,10,1,3,17 October 2018
Deadpool," Fun but not perfect
",The humour in this superhero action flick is a bit hit and miss. Overall it was a fun watch but some very cliched moments.,7,0,1,17 October 2018
Slumdog Millionaire," Decent
","I dont know that it deserved an Oscar, but I did enjoy watching it. The Bollywood cast did a fine job - moreso than the English sourced cast. Dev Patel did a decent job.",7,0,0,17 October 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Haven't seen the originals
",So I've assessed this as a standalone film. I just loved it! The action sequences were amazing. It's an adrenaline rush from start to finish. The cinematography and CGI where it was used was amazing. Visually and aurally a great film.,10,0,1,15 October 2018
Alien: Covenant," Not great, not bad.
","I have to say, this film should probably not have been made. It's just not as good as the original films. It tries to revive a franchise as so many other films in its wake have failed to do. But it was watchable.",6,0,0,15 October 2018
V for Vendetta," Great film
",I wish they'd make a sequel to this. Portman and Weaving do a fine job bringing this vigilante flick to life.,8,20,28,17 October 2018
