Black Swan," What makes a great performance?
","As the 1970 movie 'Performance' with Mick Jagger will tell you, the only great performance is one that achieves madness. Well that's not really true, but this movie wants to define it kind of like that and kind of like George Costanza in Seinfeld, 'It's not a lie if you believe it.'Anyway, I enjoyed the movie. I love ballet. The level of dancing bothered me at first then I got into it, especially the close-up filming of the end of it. All the acting was great, especially Portman and Barbara Hershey.My big complaint - SPOILER ALERT - is that during the actual performance, between acts she's alone in her dressing room. In reality there would be a dozen assistants helping her change hair, makeup and costume!Also, I never noticed what a horrible plot line Swan Lake has. One of those morality warnings for girls. Not a lot of great choices in there.",7,1,2,2 April 2011
