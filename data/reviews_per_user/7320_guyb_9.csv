The Blair Witch Project," Stupidity is just not scary
",Now I understand why there was so much comedy surrounding this movie.  This should have been titled 'Dumb and Dumber II.'  I cannot believe that a group of college students who were experienced hikers could have been this lacking in common sense. This lack of credibility and weak story line did nothing to draw me in or scare me in any way.,1,2,3,27 October 1999
Bridget Jones's Diary," Hugh Grant trainwreck
","I can see why there was so much hype about Rene Z. playing an English person.  She was fabulous; never better in a role.  But, that was it.  Sans the 'z-girl,' this was just yet another Hugh Grant blah-blah-blah.  If they would have axed him, I think the rest of the film would have supported Rene's great work.",2,1,1,10 October 2001
Save the Last Dance," This is no Flashdance and no Dirty Dancing
","I totally disagree with the reviews that claimed that 'don't be put off by the beginning of this movie; it gets really deep, original and there is great chemistry.'  This was just a nobrainer high school movie with a very hackneyed and boring ripoff of Flashdance and Dirty Dancing.ALso, it was not really very believable as a 'ghetto neighborshood and black school' and she got comfortable with the new black school awful quick for a teenager!",1,9,15,26 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," Guilty Pleasure?
","After seeing so many bad reviews for this movie, I hesitated renting it. Fortunately, one of my 99 cents rental places got it, so I took the chance. Well, I must say I really enjoyed it.  It was very similar (in style) to Titanic, but much better.  Yes, the plot was a bit hackneyed and soapy, but that's the way many, many war movies have been made.  So you just know what to expect and sit back and ride it.  Usually, I don't like Bruckheimer so much ;he'll all special effects and nothing else.  But, this time I really enjoyed it.  BTW, I also enjoyed Armageddon as well, so maybe this tells us something.  I didn't mind the length since the action was pretty constant. The (over) 30 minute sequence on the actually Dec. 7th event was fabulous.",8,0,1,9 December 2001
Hardball," Strike out in the last innings
","This movie seemed like just another Bad News Bears wannabe.  But, based on the IMDB reviews, I gave it a try.  It started out pretty good.  Keanu was pretty intense and believable.   The character development of the kids was good to.  But, once the baseball started it was pretty poor and jumped around alot.  Finally, it just fell apart at the end.  After the arch enemy coach called them on several illegalities,  he just lets the kid in the game to win.  Go figure.",1,3,8,5 July 2002
Mulholland Drive," What a letdown
","We've been big fans of Lynch ever since 'Twin Peaks.'  We were very excited to finally see the release of the DVD of Mulholland Dr.   The first 2 hours were great film noir.  But the last half hour really threw us a curve. There was no resolution of all the usual wierd Lynch subplots and characters.   We couldn't even follow the main plot and characters.  We were just exhausted by the end with no satisfaction.   The DVD didn't have an commentary option nor chapter selection (very unsual), so you had no chance to go back and try to figure it out.  What a shame.",5,0,0,14 April 2002
Thirteen Days," Been there, done that....squeek, squeek
","This was mostly rehash of historical stuff most people already know (ad nauseum).  The first scene with Jack, Bobby and Costner squeeking like Kennedys was comical, but was unbelieveable irritating as the movie went on (145 minutes).  Like fingernails on a blackboard.Boring and irritating.   I've had it with Costner movies.",1,5,20,11 July 2001
Gangs of New York," Painful
",How did this movie get all these awards?   We found it excruciating slow and painful to watch.   It was all about shots of the period.  They must have spent a fortune on the sets.   No real script that kept your attention. Very long too.   We got more out of the half hour extra from the Discovery channel on the DVD that told you everything you needed to know.,1,25,49,3 July 2003
Donnie Darko," Maybe you had to read the comix?
","This was a very well made and acted movie.  However, I really had a very hard time putting it all together.  Thankfully, I got the DVD.  I saw ALL the deleted and extended scenes.   I saw all of them with AND without commentary.  Then I still didn't have it all.  So, I saw the last 1/2 hour with commentary and that was a little better, but I STILL didn't get all of it.  By then it was 1:00 AM.  I started at the beginning WITH commentary and just got thru about 45 minutes before my time ran out.  I think I get most of it, but it still doesn't really hang together.  Not worth the effort. Maybe I need to read more comic books?  :'",3,1,3,20 March 2002
