United 93," Movie portrayed people as they should...hero's
","I was hesitant to see the movie, but after hearing a little background on it, I realized it was something that should be seen. The movie kept my heart racing and my palms sweating even though I knew the outcome. I loved that the film did not put its 'Hollywood' stamp on it by making it unbelievable or cheesy! The film was done in such a way that it focused on the sacrifice that those forty people made on that September morning. The characters looked just like everyday people, not really any big name superstars, some I have seen on TV before, but no Tom Cruise or Sarah Jessica Parker (Thanks you). If I would not have known any better, I could think that those were the actually people who were on that plane that day. I say hat's off to the director, but most of all, hat's off to all those who gave their lives on 9/11/01. Well Done!",8,0,5,6 September 2006
