Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I love it :)
","Have you seen this movie yet?  If you haven't, are you NUTS!?  This movie is a MUST see.  Why do critics hate Jar Jar so much? He's tall, orange and wears a funny jacket.  So what??  They're making such a bad rap over absolutely nothing.  My favorite character is Queen Amidala. This is my favorite movie of the trilogy so this rates as a **** *1/2 star movie.",Null,0,0,5 September 2000
