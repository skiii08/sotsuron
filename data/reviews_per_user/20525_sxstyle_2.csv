Come and See," Real, too real
","It is a disservice to call what the actors in this movie do 'acting'; they are LIVING the movie, and because of this it feels as if you are really watching what the Eastern front must have been like in 1943. The main character, in particular, actually ages VISIBLY over the course of the film, his youthfull face aging into a reflection of all the horrors he has seen.The film is full of memorable moments, and will definitely hold your interest. Upon final scene of the movie one starts to understand that there are no heroes or winners at war, there are people who forget that they are people and live according to the animal instincts.",10,4,5,12 December 2007
Ran," Beauty, Depth, Anguish, devastating
","Beauty, Depth, Anguish, devastating these are word that come to mind when you watch Kurosawa's Ran. Ran really gets deep into the Human Emotion and the Frailty of our Way. Adapting William Shakespeare's King Lear into ancient Japan. Kurosawa takes a older lord of a part of land in Japan. However because of the culture, he took the daughters and make them marry this sons. Although one of the evil son's wife is the darkest, cruelest, most demented female character ever shown on film. However some would disagree calling her a hero and that's why Kurosawa is so brilliant in this movie. Filled with unmatchable imagery of passion and beauty. this film is a most see. The ultimate darkness of human nature is revealed with uncanny accuracy. This film is pretty close to being flawless. Forget Godfather this film is much more powerful. If you are a movie lover you much match this film.",10,0,3,13 December 2007
