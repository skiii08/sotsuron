Hereditary," Weird and strange
","If the rating wasn't that high, i wouldn't think this film is that bad. I agree that the film feels like an old horror movie, the plot is strange and sometimes even funny when it should be scary. The acting and the first half is great. As soon as the film started to build up some scary moments, the plot just turned weird. So all i can say is this is one of the weirdest film in 2018.",4,0,2,3 September 2018
A Star Is Born," For the stars not for the story
","Both stars did a great but nothing interesting about the story. I like some of the songs. The romance is not intense or dramatic. Cooper did look like he can sing and Gaga as a regular waitress so i think both did a great acting job. I think Begin Again is way better. I am a Cooper's fan.... but i almost fell asleep in this one. Maybe the rating is too high, so i expect a lot of dramas and plots. Just too bad. I recommend this film for Cooper and Gaga fans. Just for the collection but not for the fun.",6,0,3,17 January 2019
BlacKkKlansman," This is a bit boring and no fun to watch, but a must see....
","To learn about racism, I think this is a good film. American History X has way more drama than this, but can't closely related. This one, yes. This film shows us that, after many years, there are not many improvement from racism and in the American government. The slogan 'American 1st, doesn't sound that racist but now it does after watching the film. I would put this one as an educational film and not for entertainment. If you like America, i suggest not to watch it. It only makes America looks bad. It does help me learn that having the notions of White Power, Black Power or Asian Power are just stupidity and dangerous.",8,4,10,6 December 2018
