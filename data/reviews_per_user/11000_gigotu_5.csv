Walk the Line," Johnny's the MAN (in black) and June's great, too
","Johnny Cash released his first song the year I was born, my Dad always loved his music, so I grew up listening to him. I'm not a country western music fan for the most part, but Johnny was one of those performers who could not be so singularly classified.This movie captured the man I knew all my life to be the young Johnny Cash. I have always been a Joaquin Phoenix fan, but he stepped it up a notch here with an Oscar-worthy performance. Reese Witherspoon, as well, captured the character of June Carter, which I did not believe possible when I first heard she had the role. She was wonderful.The scene right at the beginning of the movie where Johnny is looking at that power saw in Folsom Prison prior to his concert is one I will never forget. The foreboding of what is to come is ominous and powerfully presented.The scene where Johnny (as a 12 year old) is told by his father that the 'wrong son died!' will help all of us understand the demons he ended up having to exorcise in his rocky road to fame and spiritual freedom.If the only Johnny Cash you remember is the one who sang on stage with evangelist Billy Graham or who appeared on various gospel specials or shows, sang songs by Nine Inch Nails, or if you are too young to remember who Johnny Cash even was, then this is your opportunity to see where the journey of a great man of God, the man in black, began.",10,1,4,21 November 2005
The Polar Express," A Classic Among the Common
","In today's mega-movie world, we are bombarded with movie after movie in the weeks before Christmas. Our culture is becoming so jaundiced and our entertainment expectations so exaggerated, that we often fail to see genius before our very eyes. This movie is genius - pure and simple.Some critics have seen the genius in this movie, but many have not. Only in 20 or 30 years when we have forgotten The Incredibles, Sponge Bob, and The Kranks, will the Polar Express keep chugging and tugging at many of our hearts.I'm certainly not a kid anymore but when I see a movie like this, I yearn to be one again and, for a short time, I am.This is certainly not the most joyful movie ever made about St. Nick, but it is certainly one of the most memorable and meaningful. Even if you forget about the animation (which is spectacular) and focus only on the message, you should be moved to believe. Nor am I surprised that the IMDb readers have not rated this movie much higher. 'It's a Wonderful Life' was poorly received in 1946 when it was first released, and it is now one of the highest rated movies on this website. I wonder what its rating would be if it were released today?If you see this movie, see it with an open and unassuming, childlike mind. You should not be disappointed.",9,1,4,6 December 2004
The Usual Suspects," Is it real or is it Memorex?
","Movies, as other art forms, can manipulate us in ways that we would not be manipulated in real life. Such is the intent of 'The Usual Suspects', and it is a real disappointment in the final analysis. Basically, the last few minutes of the movie are saying to us: 'we tried to dupe you into believing all of this is true, but now you have to go back, watch the whole thing again, and differentiate between realty and a fantasy story as told by a twisted, compulsive-lying, self-perceived genius'.But when you watch the whole thing again, you (at least if you are remotely analytical) realize that the vast majority of the movie up to the last few minutes is the fantasy story as told by the twisted self-perceived genius, and only a small portion is realty. So you come to understand that only the small portion that is reality can be believed and that the entire rest of the movie that is the recollection of the twisted self-perceived genius is most likely a big LIE. But then so many people love this movie that I suppose the vast majority of us enjoy getting duped.But ask yourself this: what would you think if, at the end of The Shawshank Redemption, Andy Dufresne woke up next to his wife and said to her 'Honey, you won't believe the dream I just had. It was a dream, wasn't it?' And she just lay there motionless not saying anything. And you wonder - was it real or was it Memorex?Well, do you get it now? Probably not.",9,1,2,8 July 2003
Big Fish," Tim Burton is the best!
","This is just an incredible movie, and Tim Burton is just an incredible director. He just seems to be able to get the most out of his stories and the most out of his actors. In Big Fish, he expertly crafts a warm story of family reconciliation with a surreal journey into the past of the family patriarch, Ed Bloom. Burton is able to get the most out of both the story and the actors. There are no weak performances in this movie. Everyone from Albert Finney as the older Ed to Billy Crudup as his estranged son to Ewan MacGregor as the young adventurer to Danny Devito as the carny ringmaster are ideally cast.I had only moderate expectations when I went to see this movie, but I came out of it as one of Tim Burton's biggest fans. He just may be the biggest fish in the current generation movie making pond!",10,0,0,18 January 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," My favorite movie
","This is my favorite movie ever. I think we are all often greatly impacted by movies we see at a certain age. I was about 10 the first time I saw To Kill a Mockingbird (I had already read the book twice), and I have probably watched it 15 or so times since then. It is really 2 movies in 1. First, it is the story of Jem, Scout, Dill and their childhood in a small depression era southern town. Second, it the story of Atticus and Tom Robinson, and the relationship they developed during Tom's trial. The musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the most effective scores in developing the mood of the movie. If the scene near the end of the movie where Jem and Scout are walking home after a Halloween play at their school doesn't send chills up and down your spine, then you must have been de-sensitized by the packaged horror techniques of the modern horror flicks.Unfortunately, in this day of special effects and movie gimmicks, a movie like this will probably not have the same impact on an impressionable child like it did on me. And that is very sad.",10,1,2,23 May 2003
