Skyfall," Not very great or original, mosaic of many different films
","Didn't think Skyfall was great or original as the critics make it out to be. It didn't seem like a Bond movie rather a mish mash of Mission Impossible, Bourne, Dark Knight, Speed and Harry Potter, peppered with a bit of Bond.*****SpoilersA ridiculous shootout scene, away from technology(?) I mean, why wouldn't the British Secret Service guard the top figure at MI6????? Does it make sense to have one person i.e. Bond cover for the Head of MI6? If she's captured wouldn't she would still have an awful lot to give away, I mean she knows everything about the British Intelligence System, doesn't she? It looks like the MI6 and Bond wanted M to die.DISSECTING THE MOVIE1. Opening sequence & train fight reminds me of an opening sequence to MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. Race through the streets looks like BOURNE & getting shot, it's not clear where Bond gets shot and how he manages to survive and live in Turkey (the sequence reminds me of Bourne)2. Bond comes back into action, it's not very clear what motivates him so much & why are these agents always losing their MAN lists?? reminds me of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. If it's so easy to get into M's house why don't the bad guys just target her there? 3. Q - he's supposed to come up with gadgets, one finger-print activated gun? The new Q is so useless. I'm sure the real MI6 actually make gadgets like firing pens.4. Scene in Shanghai. I liked the lift ride Bond took up, but there's not much explanation as to what the bad guy was doing, or why he was taking out an art dealer in the next building. 5. Macao, fight at Casino Bar. Why doesn't Bond pick up his tailor made gun at the end of the fight? It's the only gadget he's got in this film. And do Komodo dragons eat people for dinner????? 6. The girl knows shes going to get killed but still takes Bond to the island with her. What, to enjoy last time sex before her death??? Bad Bond. 7. The bad guy getting disfigured from a cyanide capsule - cyanide in a capsule, it can't be that powerful to melt the whole jaw, how can he keep it in his molar???? Think cyanide reacts with stomach acid. Good guy goes bad: after becoming disfigured ex-team member guy comes back for revenge - DARK KNIGHT AND SPEED 8. The underground chase scene, bad guy DRESSED AS POLICE, with the train reminds me of SPEED 9. Why an earth did Bond take M to such a secluded spot where she is completely open to an enemy attack and why an earth is just Bond defending her??? Isn't she the head of MI6?10. James Bond and M fighting the enemy alone with him, it almost looks like Bond thinks that M DESERVES TO DIE & so does the MI6 who don't step in to help. Is this Bond's revenge as well towards M???? DON'T BLAME MUM.11. The whole Highland scene, Making nail bombs in his old house miles away from anywhere (RUBBISH) & secret passage, under the ice fighting scene, reminds me a bit of HARRY POTTER & HAGRID 12. The bad guy dies so easily 13. Eve, really irritating, she was better in the action scenes, but bad after that, just bad. M just got killed and she looks so happy. Again confirms my suspicion that the MI6 ppl all wanted M to die and take responsibility for this unoriginal movie????Doesn't seem like a Bond movie, except Bond going on to bed girls who subsequently die. NOT MY BEST BOND, Not much of a spy movie, what is this??????The characters, and acting between Bond and SilVa, the chemistry is good. But that's about it. Story and plot wise, SKYFAILOh, on second thoughts this is a great movie! Shown on the year of the Jublieee! & featuring one back stabbed Julian Assange!",5,28,55,2 November 2012
Looper," Good Film - Don't think about time travel too technically, what was meant to be will
","I enjoyed the movie. WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE WILL BESpoilersssssssssssLet's start with clearing this up, Cid is not Joe and Joe is not Cid, I have seen people in this thread being confused about this. He just empathises with the kid and realises that he too, if he had a better childhood would not have grown up to be a looper. It doesn't matter, once Joe is in the loop of being a looper, he was always going to get killed or kill himself anyway (maybe this was the conclusion that Joe the main character had; he does say in the movie that loopers are short sighted)Also if you believe that things that are meant to happen will always happen, i.e. Joe was always going to be dead in 2077 or whatever year it was and Rainmaker is always alive in 2077, with superpowers (telekinetic powers)1. THE NEW FUTURE Even where Cid does not grow up to be a rainmaker (i.e. in the unknown future, as in the ORIGINAL ending of the film where he lives happily with his mummy), the end result is that the loops are already closed (by Old Joe revenging on the Gat Men, and killing them all, thereby closing the loops himself), and also with Joe disappearing off the planet by the young Joe shooting himself. 2. THE ORIGINAL FUTURE THAT WAS In future where Cid did become the rainmaker. The Rainmaker closes the all the loops (including killing the Gat men). The young Joe kills the Old Joe and takes the gold. Because at this stage the young Joe is not too long sighted as he himself says and does not think a great deal about the future. So the end result was always the same, in the year 2077 Old Joe is wiped out and so are the loopers whilst the Cid/Rainmaker lives.",7,0,2,25 November 2012
