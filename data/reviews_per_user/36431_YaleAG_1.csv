Come and See," Power and Beauty
","Without question this has easily made my top five for the most powerful film I have seen. Excluding any amount of exaggeration I can honestly say that even having done extensive research on the subject of the film for various school projects I did truly understand the brutality of the situation until Come and See. It is a truly a film that should be shown in history classes. It is filled to the brim with absolutely unforgettable images. The key to Come and See being absolutely so powerful of a film comes from the use of little to no visual affects and attention to detail. It is blatantly obvious that live fire and explosives were used in the filming of Come and See. This was so affective that I found myself almost searching for an error in there accuracy because I could almost not believe this could have actually happened. through all my searching I only came across one error in the use of a gun that was not produced until after the time period in the film took place. However even with this I still was absolutely confused.I say confused because the absolute horror of the images and the events is unquestionable in the film. Yet it is shot in such a beautiful way. The camera movement, the colors, the actors and actresses the are all beautiful visually. Still though I'm looking at murder and horrible conditions that people are surviving in. It is seemingly a catch twenty two however I believe the combination of these two is what makes this film great.If the film had simply been ugly images of the death and hardships I may not have lasted through it. By mixing the the beauty in the visuals with the horror of the topic an amazing antiwar film is born.",10,3,3,5 June 2012
