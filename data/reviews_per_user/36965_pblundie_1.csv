The Legend of Bagger Vance," Very slow and predictable
","This was a beautifully filmed movie.  The lovely scenery, no real plot and predictability put me to sleep. Too much about golf.  There was no solid plot, much was left to the imagination and my imagination quickly faded due to lack of interest.  The acting was excellent but the movie went no where! I could not wait to leave.",Null,2,3,5 November 2000
