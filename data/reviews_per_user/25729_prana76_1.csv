Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Critics miss the point.
","This movie is incredible.  My only problem is the critics who think they are high and mighty.  They've been widely putting Episode I down.  They are the only people who have had expectations higher than any movie could reach. The only way for George Lucas to make a bad Star Wars movie would be for him to TRY to make a bad movie.The reason is simple.  The entire 'Star Wars' saga (Episodes I-VI) was written (or at least known) before any movie was ever made.  What real Star Wars fans love is the story, which was written as one, six-part saga.  Mr. Lucas will have to try really hard to disappoint his real fans.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
