10 Cloverfield Lane," A decent thriller unrelated to Cloverfield
","I was excited to see this movie as I knew nothing about it from the trailers. When the trailer showed the movie revolving around people trapped in a bunker unable to leave, I thought they were misleading us, and the truth about what was outside would be the primary plot and it would somehow relate to the events of Cloverfield. It doesn't, there isn't even a mention of those events. This is not a spoiler, it's a warning, so that you don't watch a film for reasons it doesn't deserve.It seems the intention of this film was always to be nothing other than a thriller about a woman in captivity, and anything else that may happen was an afterthought, because someone wanted to cash-in on the name recognition Cloverfield would bring.The acting is great though, the atmosphere is very tense and exchanges between characters are awkward which is hard to pull off with someone as lovable as John Goodman. On the flip side it's plagued by jump-scares which creates a false sense of unease, as I never knew when the next loud noise would strike.Had the movie just told a story without lying about it's connections to another movie, and not used jump scares, I would respect it as a thriller if that's what the intention was. The ending was not worth waiting through the rest of it to see. As it stands, I don't recommend anyone see it in cinemas, but see it on DVD if you want to.",6,5,11,10 March 2016
