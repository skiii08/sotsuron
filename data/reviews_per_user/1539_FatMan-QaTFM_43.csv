Moneyball," Looking like The Social Network just isn't enough to make a good movie.
","The Fat Man does not like baseball. No cheerleaders. Football's my game. For some reason though, I was drawn to Moneyball like a fat moth to a bacon flame. Maybe it's Brad Pitt's massive screen presence and acting ability heh. Or perhaps I really want to like baseball a lot and watching this, Field of Dreams, and Angels in the Outfield will finally bring me in to the fold. However, it's probably fellow fatty Jonah Hill's presence that made me feel welcome at a baseball movie.Moneyball tried to explain Billy Beane's (Brad Pitt) implementation of sabremetrics to improve the Oakland A's chances for a championship team on a shoestring MLB budget. He's struggling with his lot in life until fictional Peter Brand (fat fatty Jonah Fatness Hill) tells him to use the power of maths and win some games. Things turn around, but in the end, it's just not enough. Season and movie over.While it's no Miracle  well it's no Miracle. That's the closest comparison I can make. Long shot hockey team wins it all. Long shot baseball team does not win. They go on a record-setting 20 game run, but even the movie tears itself down immediately by pointing out this means nothing. Nobody remembers the A's run except for die-hard A's fans that have no hope. While this is historical, what reading I've done about the real Billy Beane seems pretty far removed from the movie. Why not go full fictional and have them win the World Series? That wouldn't have sat well with a lot of fans, but would have made the movie more interesting. As it stood, the movie was incomplete.Moneyball covered the beginnings of Beane's use of sabremetrics with the A's, but he's still there, still using the system. He's yet to win a World Series. This is a story – continual failure with a system that should be working correctly, convincing the league that there's merit to this system, and his loyalty to a franchise over money. Moneyball wasn't really a movie about the system either – that could have been pretty interesting for the nerdier types. Instead it used a fictional character to whisper little numbers in Beane's ear instead of crediting him with knowing the system himself. In all, the movie shows just a snippet of something that really does not matter and isn't that interesting. While Hill and Pitt are a great duo, they can't break through the tedious nothingness of the plot.Great idea, but needed moresomething. Looking like The Social Network just isn't enough to make a good movie.",Null,0,0,26 September 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Expensively made cheap entertainment
","Pirates of the Caribbean is now officially a tetralogy joining the ranks of Rambo, Dennis the Menace, Scream, and Indiana Jones. Much like Indiana Jones or any other movieseries that overstays its welcome, Pirates began to wear thin with me after the second installment. Slapped together plots with phoned in performances really ruined what could have been a simple, enjoyable series of films. I'm no fan of Bruckheimer, since he's been recently ruining every good thing ever thought up, but there seem to be bigger forces at work in this particular set of movies.On Stranger Tides is a complete reboot of the series – a few familiar faces, but really the original trilogy is a distant memory. While I am not the least bit sorry to see the old characters jettisoned, writers don't even pretend to explain Jack Sparrow's supposed ties to the Black Pearl and being out to sea for 10 years at a time in relation to the current storyline. What is it, 15 years in the future or so? They simply introduce new characters and do that annoying Star Wars: Episode 2 thing humorously reminiscing on scenes we will never have the displeasure of experiencing. Classic insult to the audience. I'd prefer a hazy, washed-out flashback, thankyouverymuch.All that complaining aside, I rather enjoyed the film. It definitely did not leave anything for the audience to figure out and seemed to make up its own rules along the way (yeah, that's right, you need a mermaid tear, 2 goats, and a willing man and the fountain will give you 6 delicious plums that when baked into a flan will create a meal that will take 10 years off of your life. Also, you need a magic entrance to the fountain, but you can just walk on out of that thing through conventional means), but who cares. This series never pretended to be anything but popcorn shoveling fun. I just gagged a little bit admitting that.Despite the CONSTANT chatter of the teenage population of Falmouth, Maine just an aside based on my sampling of the restaurants, Wal-Mart, and movie theater, I believe the median age of Falmouth to be around 14. Perhaps we should be looking for the fountain of youth there Where was I?Despite the CONFUSED teenagers that needed to explain the plot of the movie to each other and wonder where Penelope Cruz was in the other films, I enjoyed the movie for what it was – expensively made cheap entertainment. I wonder if they can figure out how to make production cheaper to turn this into another Blondie or Django series.",Null,2,2,24 August 2011
Sucker Punch," Story, sexy, and action promises broken
","'A special effect is a tool; a means of telling a story. A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.' – George Lucas.I'll let that soak in for a quick second. Friday night marked the start of a great Belgian beer festival near a new (to me) Regal theater. I had a few awesome beers with my wife and then, feeling pretty good, we went to see the movie. Unfortunately for us there was also a crack-head seeing the movie and he was feeling pretty good (read: chatty) too.Back to Mr. Lucas. While he has proved his own point with episodes one through three, I generally disagree. I love movies like District B:13 and Day After Tomorrow. They are characterized by a lack of plot and lots of great action/visual effects. It's craft beer for the eyeballs. Sucker Punch's trailer promised viewers two things: boobies and action with the possibility of some of the decent storytelling that Zack Snyder has exhibited in the past. It was the story of a girl in a mental hospital that reverts into this war-like inner world in order to deal with that is going on around her. Escape from a crazy nazi-fueled dream. I am behind this film in a big way.What I failed to notice from the trailer was the mental world in-between the crazy house and the crazy nazi world. The time where she imagines herself trapped in a cabaret/brothel makes up a good 80% of the film. This world is not filled with action or much sexy. It's just a lot of overly dramatic girls making broad statements about freedom, self, and how everything is impossible or not. The crack-head vocally approved whenever something touched his drugged up soul. 'I lost everyone I loved. And then they locked me away. With no where to hide from the pain,' Baby Doll says. 'Mmm, yes. That's right,' the crack-head says. Story and sexy fail.Visually the portions of the film set in the nazi world were beautiful, but very sterile. I never thought I'd complain about something being too stylized, but Hollywood has a way of pushing the envelope. These scenes also made up about 12 minutes total from the film. Action promise fail.This film had such potential. It was disturbingly honest about what most movie watchers want to see. I would applaud Snyder for his bait- and-switch, but I think he just failed at making the sexy action film he really wanted. And just to ruin your day a little more: the next Superman is also the next film in Snyder's downward trajectory.At least it spoke to the crack-head.",Null,0,3,24 August 2011
Source Code," Fun, worth the price of admission
","I was going to warn you about spoilers, but this movie can totally be described without spoiling a thing.I had no reason to think that Source Code would be any good. Eh, I take that back. Duncan Jones directed and I sure did like Moon a few years back. It wasn't perfect, but seemed thoughtful and well shot. No complaints, just good movie times. Add to that the fact that I had seen Insidious earlier and really a day can't get much lower than that. So I headed to my favorite beer bar then tried out a new Mexican joint. Delicious nachos, 4 beers, and a mojito later, I was back at the crack- head Regal Cinema. I swiped my Regal card and got a free ticket for next time. Excellent.I settled into a mostly empty theater (oh yes!) and got ready. Buy Coca-Cola, popcorn, and a car, then the trailers. I can't even remember the first one. What I do remember is seeing the dreaded peaked logo and whispering 'Nnnnnnoooo' as Summit entertainment popped on the screen. The Beaver? So this is what hitting bottom looks like for Mel Gibson. A few more Summit trailers and it dawned on me – I didn't know anything about this movie but 8 minutes, Duncan Jones, and Jake Gyllenhaal. This is supposed to be a sci-fi, special effects driven movie. Summit can't even get vampires right. Pointy teeth, that's it, and they still can't pull it off.I was sad and a little angry.But I soon forgot I was tricked into seeing a Summit production. Technical pseudo time-travel, wormhole, quantum mechanics movies tend in one direction – overly complicated. In theory all of these things are very complicated but you don't need to weigh down a movie by making up analogies to explain concepts that the film makers probably have no understand of to begin with. Source Code was a breath of fresh air in this regard. There was a discovered plot line - we learned more about Gyllenhaal's character a little bit at a time, all the way down to the last minutes of the film. We learn more about the technology that made his time-travel possible to the point that it was fairly obvious what was going on, but not explained enough to create bothersome plot holes. The big reveal wasn't done to shock you, but was part of an incredibly touching sequence that embodied hope, perseverance, and love. Worries over Summit special effects were unwarranted – the story was more of a romance than a big explosion blockbuster.A word on Jake Gyllenhaal. He was great in October Sky, I laughed at his ridiculous character in The Day After Tomorrow, and after that I felt like he got a bit too big for his britches. When did this guy become a critically acclaimed actor? What could have possessed him to put on a stupid British accent and ruin Prince of Persia? In all fairness, Bruckheimer ruined PoP by twisting the story so much that there was nothing left of the engaging games that inspired the movie. Gyllenhaal really went down on the hate meter with his performance in Source Code. It was subtle, passionate, and injected just a little bit of humor throughout the film.I forgot about Love and Other Drugs until just now though. Hate meter is reinstated by romping with Clowny Hathaway.All-in-all, a fun flick that was worth the price of admission. I can't wait to see what Duncan Jones cranks out next!",Null,0,0,24 August 2011
The Hangover," Begs the question 'Can you call it a comedy if there are no jokes?'
","I'll be straight up honest: I didn't like The Hangover. I thought it was over-hyped and really not much to write home about. Back then it got a C- and I recall considering walking out it was so offensive and pointless. All that didn't stop it from raking in almost a half-billion worldwide.This style of movie is a convergence of the Tina Fey generation of comedy writers and the R-rated comedy run that started probably with Wedding Crashers and has not let up. They are the comedies with no jokes, just funny/gross/offensive/wacky – you name it – as long as you don't have to actually put in the effort of writing a single funny line of dialog.Here we go on Part 2. In a particularly good choice, I went to the crack-head cinema. I've yet to see a good movie at this theater and I didn't think anything was going to change. Turns out crack-heads are within the target audience. The place was packed and roared with laughter throughout the entire movie. I was a little island of silence in the middle of a jovial (high) crowd. I managed one 'heh' at some Galifianakis line, but it was Part 1 all over again. And I mean that literally – it was the same story in every way, just set in a different city. They wake up after a wild bender, someone's missing, all is well by the end.The difference that gave The Hangover a C- was a bit of heart, some personal growth, and a little bit of dramatic tension. Phil has to own up to what happened, Stu broke up with his controlling girlfriend to pursue his wife/stripper with a heart of gold. I know you're saying 'But this is a comedy, Fat Man! There's no plot needed!!' Sure, if it's complete non-sequitur comedy, but any narrative (comedy or not) need to have some plot structure and a reason to exist. All that development is all thrown out the window in Part 2 where they are all great friends already, Stu has dumped his mistake of the past and they apparently have not learned a single thing about honesty. Bottom line: I don't care how cool a woman is, none of this is instantly okay. With some time, maybe. Right away? Absolutely not. The characters reverted to their selfish lying selves that we saw at the beginning of Part 1. Also, extreme irresponsibility, last I checked, does not increase the respect of someone who has no respect for you to begin with. You know, just in case you were planning something wild to impress your boss and get that big raise.The Hangover Part II is just another R-rated comedy that begs the question 'Can you call it a comedy if there are no jokes?'",Null,2,3,24 August 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A few genuinely funny moments completely smothered by an overall insulting premise.
","Comedies have not had a good track record with me in recent years. Crazy, Stupid, Love didn't present much via trailer to keep me from pre-assigning a bad review, but what the heck – that's why we watch the movies!CSL (as it will be called for brevity's sake) opens with about 90% of the trailer – Emily (Julianne Moore) wants a divorce, Cal (Steve Carell) can't handle it and jumps out of the car. Cal meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), professional womanizer, and transforms from a simple, committed husband to a complete sleaze-bag. Meanwhile, Jessica likes Cal, Robbie likes Jessica, David likes Emily, Hannah likes Jacob, Molly likes TV, TV likes trailers for CSL, and we all follow with ease despite the attempts at misdirection.The wheels really came off in the second half as all these story lines attempt to resolve and still try to bring the funny. As Carson on ScriptShadow says, 'the first 60 (minutes) were all one big setup, and the last sixty (minutes) are a continuous ESPN ticker feed of payoffs.' Unfortunately, he was talking about the script which I'm going to assume was significantly better than the film itself. Character development poses a problem for the payoffs. Actions indicate that each and every one of the characters are not just flawed, realistic people, but the kind of morally bankrupt individuals that can only come from the Hollywood mind. We're to believe that despite sleeping with a number of women in the what 4 months of separation from his wife, that Cal still really loved his wife throughout it all? That would fly if he slept with one woman, had remorse, and settled in to the main plot of trying to win his soul mate back, but we're supposed to believe his sincerity through some cliché dialog and a few pitiful acts of 'love.' Likewise, Jacob has slept with, if we follow the logic of the limited timeline we see, thousands of women. We're likewise to believe that in one hasty montage where he, for the first time, laughs and shows more than that half-dimension he was assigned, he's now a changed man? Cal's reaction to that is probably the most genuine moment in the entire film.I can't even begin to unravel the twisted morals of that CSL throws at the audience. I don't go to movies to judge, honestly, but when the theme supposedly is 'true love', this warped L.A. view on love insults anybody with a real relationship. If I were separated, slept with a dozen women, and then had the unmitigated gall to claim I never stopped loving my wife through it all, I would expect her to not just laugh in my face but also beat me to within an inch of my life. Cheating is one thing, but Cal's response to it is so odious that it just revealed that he never was the simple good-guy at the core. Once you pull that rug out from under the plot, there's nothing enjoyable or believable about this film.As if audiences couldn't be insulted enough, this unabashedly Los Angeles-centric film was crudely dumped in to the indie film mold complete with quirky soundtrack, minimal locations, and lots of hand-held shots. Really? Do they think audiences can be fooled that easily? Them and critics both, apparently – Tom Long of the Detroit News thinks that this film should get an Oscar. He uses little phrases like 'astoundingly strong ensemble' and 'Gosling, probably the best dramatic actor of his generation' while wishing all the while he could get out of this hell-hole known as Detroit and live with the real people in California. Get a grip, man!With a few genuinely funny moments completely smothered by an overall insulting premise, Crazy, Stupid, Love doesn't really give you anything to love.",Null,5,12,24 August 2011
Balls of Fury," Mocked its own genre, not for everybody
","This is a Thomas Lennon written comedy, so you know it's going to be a little abstract, and very pacing based. Balls of Fury really did a great job of keeping in the same humor vein of Reno 911, etc.Yes, there are crotch shots and other typical middle school humor, but they happened so often and with such randomness that it went from stupid to hilarious.A lot of the humor is based in uncomfortable moments. Not a lot of people enjoy being made uncomfortable by something they are viewing for entertainment, but if you like that style of humor, Balls of Fury is right up your alley.This isn't for everybody, so it'll either be a 10 or 1 for you. Worth the rental just to see.",8,34,46,16 December 2007
Hot Fuzz," A lovely combination of violence and Brit comedy
","The guys from Shaun of the Dead deliver once again with a great action flick that combines the best parts of violence and absurd British comedy.I will say that this movie is not for the faint of heart. Despite it being a comedy, some of the deaths are very grisly and realistic (well, I can't really verify that last bit, but it looked like I thought it would). I'm sure Tristan Versluis never gets the props he deserves, so here they are Tristan - PROPS TO YOU! (and if Tristan happens to be a girl's name, sorry)Plot wise, it's very absurd. I can't say that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright come up with stories based in reality, but it's entertaining and has its twists. I'm not going to spoil the movie, go rent it for yourself.Great movie, good times, but I will say that Simon Pegg without Nick Frost is nothing. I learned that by watching Big Nothing. Yay, learning is painful!",Null,0,0,25 August 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A ship without a pilot, meandering the seas of boring
","Some things from your childhood you cherish. Pop Rocks, Monopoly (until your dad crafts a crooked deal and you end up with the utility companies and he's got 4 monopolies), and bad haircuts. I also used to love the 'choose your own adventure' books. You know, you get to see if Joe Hardy gets hit on the head with a baseball bat or a frying pan, and if Frank finds him tied up or in a bag. It gave you power over your entertainment.Now imagine reading one of those books where not only was someone choosing your adventure for you, but when they came to a scenario they didn't like, they'd change it - you've got Pirates 3. Joe gets hit over the head with a dead fish and Frank finds him at World's End.I'll start with some good things. Johnny Depp's acting job was far superior in this flick than it was in the last two movies. Unfortunately the funniest parts had nothing to do with the story and were complete deviations. The costuming was very good, as usual. Kudos to Justin Geer for rocking it as a pirate (gotta give the local love). By far, the best part of the movie was the trailer for Transformers. Booya! Gonna be awesome. (Note: I wrote this when I saw POTC in theaters - boy was I wrong)That was brief, like my sense of enjoyment while being held hostage for nearly 3 hours as I was beat over the head with stupid plot, overall poor acting, and terrible CGI and sound design. 'But nobody cares about sound design, Fat Man.' Right they don't. They should. Being forgiving of an industry whose sole purpose is to create entertaining films is only harming you. You critique an independent film to death (which you should), but don't care about an industry that is supposed to be the highest level of professionalism around, but can't put enough detail into CGI to make it reasonably realistic. Flame off.This movie was a ship without a pilot. I will be accused of hating fun, but I don't think there's a problem with having standards. My appendectomy was a better watch.",Null,1,2,25 August 2011
Spider-Man 3," You can tell nobody wanted to make this movie, but the money soothes the pain
","Have you ever been to one of those 2nd grade plays where none of the kids want to be on stage, except for that one kid dressed as a tree who shakes his limbs like there's no tomorrow? It's painful to watch, and you can tell everybody involved just wants it to be over as soon as possible.Grow everybody up into their late 20s and you've got Spider-man 3. I don't think Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunce (please note I did not make fun of her teeth, although the transition from the 2nd grader comparison would have been perfect. I'm bigger than that.), or James Franco could have been less thrilled about starring in the newest adventure. If you strip away the mediocre CGI and leave the performances, you've got something that almost ends up spoofing itself.Down to it. What was good? Thomas Hayden Church played an excellent Sandman. That was one of the few character designs that I thought went really well. Unintentionally poking fun at Reuters for having cheap shopped images also ranked among the good. Beyond that, there was really not much going on. Maybe my opinion would be different if I had not dragged myself out to the theater at 4:15AM on a Friday morning, but I felt for all the hype and the effort on my part, I was gypped.Complaint department. Please take a number.1) Venom. One of the coolest villains EVER - not really powers wise, but the look is so amazing, that you can't help but have a character that drops jaws. The comic version vs. the movie version? Big ding dang difference.2) Plot. Nobody cares how Spider-man feels. You like that there's a little internal struggle, but in the end, you just want to see him fight baddies and win. Spider-man 2 had so much action, I could barely stand it. It had enough between MJ and Peter that you were curious about where they would go from there, but I'm guessing a lot of those scenes met the skip button when the movie was rewatched on DVD. Spidey 3 could have been 45 minutes shorter and still have been pretty solid.3) Dancing. I don't come to a super-hero movie and expect (or want) to see dancing. Not now, not ever. I had run out of snackums by the time those scenes came around, and I was paralyzed in horror with nothing to do but stare.4) Every forced emotion throughout this move. 'Anakin, you're breaking my heart.'That's really about it. Save your time and money, and watch Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer instead.",Null,0,0,25 August 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Slow-paced Drama, but Enjoyable Nonetheless
","There's a right and wrong way to do a remake. For example, you don't take a creepy, slow-paced Swedish film called Let the Right One In and hand it off a year later to the creator of 'Felicity.' Instead, you take a classic TV drama made over 30 years ago (plenty of time to bottle age properly) and hand it off to the brilliant director of a creepy, slow-paced Swedish film.Like all spy movies, there's a mole and it must be trapped. Why can't there be a spy movie where everybody is who they say they are and you can trust everyone? Hmm? I think it's called a Western. Anyway, it's the Cold War era and there's a Soviet spy in MI6. George Smiley is Britishly coaxed out of retirement to take care of the situation, and (SPOILER) he does.As spy movies go, this one isn't high on drama. It's a very well crafted, clever film but did not have me on the edge of my seat. That's what Mission Impossible movies are for. This movie was also pitched early as a 'thinking' movie and I completely disagree. Sure, it wasn't laid out for you in every detail, but the investigative work done by Smiley makes sense and has good results. Story-wise, I didn't see it as being a great choice for Best Picture©. Where the movie really got my attention was the characters. I swear this movie had every great British actor since ever. Their attention to detail on the subtlety of the characters, especially by Oldman, convincingly put the movie its proper era – a time of tense distrust and unease.I also thought the film had a nice high-grain look that lent itself to feeling like you were watching a period film. Hoyte Van Hoytema, the Cinematographer, was the fine gentleman that shot The Fighter as well as Tomas Alfredson's Let the Right One In (can you tell I'm a fan?). Add to that great costuming, nice hair, and you've got a realistic piece. Just once I'd like to see costume design win an Oscar for a movie depicting 20 or 30 years back instead of Victorian or Elizabethan times.All in all, an enjoyable film. I have not seen the original series or read the source text, but it seems to be a crowd pleaser from that respect. I'd probably get better insight into the subtleties of the characters, but it would also ruin the ending so that's my defense of going in to a remake unprepared.",Null,1,2,24 February 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," Brutally violent, but an excellent film
","At the risk of being spoilerish, let me say that this movie did not play out as billed. It looked like there would be a lot more fantasy and a lot less of the 'real life' stuff. Although this wasn't the case, I did still enjoy the movie.Sergi López has to be one of the greatest villains I've ever seen. He was so brutally evil that I loved to watch what he would do next. Obsession is a beautiful thing when played out properly.The fantasy portions of the film were not as nice as I expected. They were very gritty and a bit scary. The melding of stories and myths bothered me just a little bit, but I think I can get over it.I don't know too much to say without giving a lot of the movie away. The fantasy and real life were well crafted and played out right to the end perfectly. An excellent movie that deserves a watch if you can stomach the violence.",Null,1,4,25 August 2011
Knocked Up," A **** fun movie
","In an effort to make The Fat Man reviews suitable for young children, I'm going to edit my review of this crude and inappropriate R-rated comedy.

Seth Rogen traditionally has been a **** player in comedies like 40 Year Old Virgin, but showed a **** of depth in some of the more dramatic moments (although ****). His **** to being the father is one of the most **** reactions I've **** in a movie.All in all, the film was pretty ****, but ****.

Horrible Bosses," Never had a fighting chance to be watchable
","Earlier this year I had a root canal and 2 cavities. Pain, swelling, and general discomfort. However, I feel better about spending $5000 and receiving core-shaking pain than shelling out $7 or whatever for these lame excuses for 'comedy' that roll out like cheap trinkets from a production line. The biggest offender for years now is Brett Ratner. Every time I see a picture, he looks more and more like a hot-dog that fell on the floor – greasy, hairy, and with no taste or shame. He's all cow lips and pig-snouts.We get with Horrible Bosses a star-studded comedy featuring TV's hottest stars plus a few worn out actors that had the option of the casting couch with Ratner or being in his movie. You can't get anywhere in Hollywood without owing him a favor, it would seem. Anyhoo, our hapless heroes haaate their bosses. I mean who doesn't, right? Right? You hate your boss, Working Joe. So they do what any sensible people would do – kill them, or at least attempt it. I don't feel like I'm spoiling anything just yet.Each scene plays out like a poorly written SNL script. Or well-written if we're talking Tina Fey years and beyond. There's a little visual gag, maybe a bit of plot, and some half-hearted acting by whatever name graces that segment. The disinterest on the part of most actors was more than evident. Colin Ferrell couldn't keep his accent in check, Charlie Day simple transfered his character from Always Sunny in to a new set of circumstances (although many were eerily similar). Poor guy's going the way of John HederPerhaps one of the most insulting things about the movie is the reasoning that led to 'Let's kill our bosses.' Let us play problem/solution, shall we?Problem: You are a registered sex offender, your boss is sexually harassing you. You believe you cannot get a job anywhere else.Solution: It's constant. Get a camera, get an audio recorder, build a case, and sue for sexual harassment. Settlements start at around $100,000 and a dentist isn't going to ruin her career over that bit of money. Take the money, hire another lawyer, and seek a pardon. Or you could kill her.Problem: You are overworked and your boss passes you over for a promotion. He's simply dreaaaaadful and so mean-spirited. He says if you leave, he'll ruin you in the industry. How? By writing a bad letter of recommendation.Solution: Every employer knows the former employer may have an attitude about an employee leaving. I doubt a little VP is going to be so influential in the biz (ha, see that term?) that his word alone will disqualify you. Find a new job, quit the old one, move on. Or you could kill him.Problem: Your dead boss's son takes over the company and flat out tells you he is going to milk it for money and then shut it down.Solution: For about $5000 a pop, each employee could take ownership of the company and buy him out for a few million dollars. There's no real assets to sell off in the company, and he's obviously not good with money, so a cool $2 mil will look pretty appealing. Or you could call the police and have him busted for huge amounts of coke.All of these story linchpins can be solved pretty efficiently and easily. Obviously the writers have never lived in the real world ('How much could a banana cost, ten dollars?'). I'm guessing everyone that has ever had a job quickly deduced the cheapest legal way to solve each problem in the first 10 minutes. Some of us became hung up on major plot points and considered the rest of the movie to be stupid and pointless, almost insulting. Most folks just didn't go see the movie. And Queer loved it. Guess we know what that means, DON'T WE.This movie reminds me strongly of Code Name: The Cleaner – from the looks of it everybody had a great time shooting. Short days, fun cast, etc. Fun for the cast, but definitely not fun to watch. Oh look, Fatty Fat Ratner produced it. If you take a few minutes to connect the dots before you see a movie, you can avoid worthless films altogether. Links to SNL, that horrible Kelsey Grammar sketch show, and, of course, Ratner himself don't really give this movie a fighting chance to ever be watchable.",Null,0,2,24 August 2011
Tangled," Pretty film smothered in boring music
","I reeeeaaally like animation. Although I love the old hand-drawn cartoons of old, I do enjoy the modern marvel of CGI animated films. I had little desire to see Tangled in theaters, especially considering it's Disney but not Pixar. However with all the great reviews and the Oscar nominated film from the typically awesome Alan Menken, I figured I should review the DVD when it came out.The move has a beautiful opening that has a very different retelling of the start of the story from the original Grimm tale. Original: Man's pregnant wife is dying to have some lettuce and drives him to steal from a magical garden woman who then takes their child when it is born. Disney: Queen is dying of having a baby (sort of similar) and needs a magical plant to survive. Just happens to be the witch's fountain of youth plant, so she steals the baby in vengeance. Pregnant women, guys – am I right? Huh? High five.So anyhoo, from there the movie goes typical Disney – grotesque side characters, funny/cute animals, and beautiful pop-talented singer leads. I am happy to see Zack Morris getting work as the male lead here. Or maybe just his hair. The story never really takes off into any kind of high drama like you got in days of old with Snow White, Sleeping Beauty (freakin' crap, that dragon scared me as a kid), or even The Incredibles. Sort of an 'oh, that could be bad' with an 'oh, that resolved painlessly.'The film had it's fun moments, but the songs weren't any of them. I think this would appeal way more to adults if the songs were catchy, as in Aladin. That said the action, animation, and story are perfect for the kidlins who might like a good fairy tale. It even has a great moral: you can never have a happy ending without being very wealthy and powerful. Also, kids, you can get a great layered cut with just one swipe from a broken mirror shard! Try it at home!On a positive note, we did get a great Nick Pitera cover of 'I See the Light.'This film would have been a strong B-range contender were in not for the plentiful sprinkling of boring songs.",Null,1,3,24 August 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," It's a fatally flawed movie that's just another production that HAD to happen so Avengers could make sense
","Gonna let you know right off the bat, there are some spoilers near the end of the review. I can't fully justify my grade without railing in to some obvious deficiencies in the handling of some plot points. Don't worry, there will be big SPOILER tags to let you know what to skip.There's nothing in the movie that you didn't already see in the trailer. Steve Rogers was some little twerp nobody wants, but he just keeps enlisting and even starts faking info to attempt time and time again. His big heart finally gets him his big shot and he's transformed through movie magic (and a strict weight-lifting regime) in to Captain America! He develops an unhealthy, instant grudge against Red Skull and puts his crack team of normals together to stop that bad man. This is all sounding a little.. familiar. Audie Murphy was 5'5″, 110 pounds and enlisted in 1942 at age 17 with a fake birth certificate. During his 27 months of fighting in Europe, one of his good friends was killed and he proceeded to wipe out the machine gun crew responsible and then use their gear to wipe out some more enemy positions. He wasn't done yet. On January 26th, 1945, he fought off advancing German troops for an hour using, among other things, a .50 cal machine gun atop a burning tank destroy. He was shot in the leg, but still kept going. Add to that he had been shot once before, wounded with mortar shrapnel another time, and had malaria throughout his time fighting. But anyway, let's go back to being impressed by super-human Captain America with his super-weapons.There are little things in Captain American that can put you off the film. Some great actors were cast, including Chris Evans (I cannot explain my strange fondness for him) and Stanley Tucci. In a particularly well written, well acted scene, they talk about heart, the country, and give you a little back-story. This quiet, touching scene is inexplicably overrun with flashbacks exactly illustrating everything Tucci says. He's talking about an operation, flash up a needle! Johann Schmidt, who's that? Let's show you! As if audiences are too stupid to to know what is going on without spoon feeding information in the most clumsy fashion possible. There are numerous other editing gaffs, bad CGI moments, and little oddities that scream 'RUSHED' (supposedly was), but I won't belabor the point.Let's get to the big issue: the Children of Israel. Captain America has just formed a group of crack HYDRA killers, armed to the teeth with futuristic weapons. He has a big heart and always wants to do good. First order of business: overwhelming the poorly trained, underarmed guards at Auschwitz and free the Jews from their nightmarish captivity right? While Quentin Tarantino's alternate WWII storyline involves brutal execution of Nazis with Hitler as the end goal, this alternate reality skips over the horrors of the Nazi regime and treatment of the Jewish people, and goes straight for the wallet with big explosions, futuristic weapons, and an anticlimactic fight that that literally nose-dives to the end. You can argue that they needed to destroy the arms depots because the entire world was at stake, but I don't think they learned that until a bit later, giving them enough time for the needs of a few (or 6 million plus, as it were).SPOILERS LIE AHEAD - skip to the next set of CAPS to miss this.What made me love the movie for an instant before hating it again was the romance aspect. I know, cheese. However, one of the best developed story lines in the movie involved Peggy Carter and Cap'n America's love affair, if it could be called that. The simple innocence that culminated not in a sweaty sex pile, but in that one long awaited kiss, really instilled a purity to Steve Roger's character. The film opens with military finding The Shield frozen inside a huge structure. As it becomes apparent that the structure is the aircraft Rogers is piloting to his doom, you wonder 'Will he make it? Was he even inside? They only showed his shield. I hope he makes his date.' Big Spoiler – he doesn't. And he doesn't even seem to care. We get a quick 'Oh, I had a date.' line and then that's it. Everybody he ever knew is dead, including his one true love. That's too difficult for an audience to get (see: spoon feeding), so let's just skip over.END OF SPOILERS – continue here.Immediately after seeing the movie, I could have given it an A or B+, but after some careful thought and writing this long review, I really can't. It's a fatally flawed movie that's just another production that HAD to happen so Avengers could make sense. Things that do not make sense: slapping that quick-cut trailer at the end of the movie. I'm all for unconventional, but that's just silly.",Null,1,4,23 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," I wanted to like it, but it was tediously boring
","In an attempt recreate the feeling of watching Deathly Hallows: Part 1, I'm going to review it in a dreadfully long, boring, tedious, complaining sort of way.I have not read the sacred text. Having seen every movie thus far, this is how I see it going: We've got Harry Potter, the chosen one who has the power to defeat Volder.. Voltra the bad guy, who slowly regenerates and becomes fully evil and powerful. Just like Sauron. So Frodo has to find the sacred Horcruxi that bind Sauron to the tower in Mordor and destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor. All the while Samwise's relationship with Hermione causes tension when Fro-er Harry appears in a vision all naked and foggy snogging her beside a Goblet of Fire. Give me a break here. It's been 10 years since the first film and I'm not doing a 7 film refresher to watch yet another Harry Potter movie. Having not read the books, I did expect some kind of, you know, climax. A big battle, fire, dragons, all the magic stops pulled out!! INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC, DO YOUR WORST! Except they didn't do the effects on this filmI did a breakdown on number of pages, number of movie minutes, total budget, and total gross box office take - yes, I correlated a bunch of unrelated types of data. What I noticed was budget is about the same, box office is about the same, but a sharp jump in page numbers is where the film series lost me – right about at Goblet of Fire. Confusing, spotty, lots of 'oh you should have read the book' responses to my questions. At least Dune came with a pocket guide of terminology. It's been downhill from here, but in my naive hopefulness, I was expecting something better. Darkest film ever, I was told. Exciting conclusion so bedwettingly incredible, we had to release it in two parts, they said.Not so! Dark because I was asleep. Bedwettingly dull, if you ask me. I think one of my biggest problems with the films ('should have read the book!') was a distinct lack of a cohesive timeline. See, there are things called 'script days' you have to account for when you're in preproduction to decide costuming, locations, weather, time of year, etc. The 'hiding out' portion of the film supposedly happened over a period of weeks or months (according to THE BOOK). When your characters are wearing the same costumes day in and day out (what, they can conjure up a tent, but not some new clothes?), you don't have a clue how long they've been in the woods and which locations are miles away or right next door or reachable by magic only. Quoi? I felt dragged through haphazard storyline that had dozens of locations, but still meandered on for hours on end. I would have preferred to get it over with in one 6 hour sitting. I did it for the Dune TV series – twice. I can take it.You've got to make some cuts when it comes to filming. Film makers are not servicing anybody when they create an overdrawn, boring movie. The book readers will always always ALWAYS hate the movie version anyway so why pander to them? Make it fun to watch. Lord of the Rings made some tough choices, but I think we can all agree Tom Bombadil wasn't missed in the least. Result: long, but great movies and 15 Oscars.Oh, the Oscars! Let's make a wild prediction about that, shall we? Nine nominations, no wins. At least Lord of the Rings got 4 of 13 on the 1st one and 11 of 11 on the 3rd. Is the Academy saving up? Is Part 2 really going to be so good that they can create the illusion that they're rewarding just that movie and not the entire series? I've heard complaints about being misled by Portman's dancing abilities and how it swayed voting for Black Swan, but there are no qualms with rewarding a sub-par movie for the accomplishments of movies past? Mark my words, one reader that actually made it this far in my review, there will be Oscars a-plenty for everybody. This is not the year to release your shining gem, because you've got a spoon's chance in the fork drawer of winning.I wanted to like Part 1, I really did! Enough time passes that I feel excited again and forget I couldn't stand the last installment. They've only given me 7 month to recover and I can't say I'm too excited any more. Let's get it over with, like this review.",Null,2,2,24 August 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," A nicely made kids film
","A summer of sequels. A weekend of sequels. After enduring The Hangover Part II, I really looked forward to this 3D Sunday matinée. If you've paid attention at all, you know that I love animation. Even something as kid-friendly as Kung-Fu Panda gives me the slightest butterflies of anticipation for what animation marvels I will see.Animation-wise, KFP 2 served up a pretty impressive palate of animated delights. The intro was a 2D, paper-cutout styled sequence with colorful versions of the film's 3D characters. All the flashbacks were a traditional 2D animated style that accentuated the dreamy/horror feel of Po's mystery-shrouded past. I appreciate 3D animation as much as the next person. Wall-E ranks in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. 3D has its own artistry, but it's so mass-produced, that I don't enjoy the creative aspect as much as the realistic (I could see each individual hair!). I love to see creative 2D sequences integrated into a 3D film.Enough gushing over technology! As a children's film, the story really revolves around easy-to-grasp themes like loyalty, trying really hard even if you don't want to, doing your homework, and uh genocide? This will be a bit of a spoiler if you have not seen the film, but it's only spoiling the first 5 minutes of the film before the credits. The Nazi White Supremest Peacock, who SHOULD have been voiced by Christopher Waltz but was instead voiced by Gary Oldman, plays a cross between Herod and Hitler when he takes out his wolves and murders all of the pandas in China when it is foretold that he will be defeated by something white and black (and read all over). Kids-in-mind.com, a site that has probably promoted searching for nudity in movies more than it has helped avoid it, lists 'discussion topics' as adoption, families, friendship, loyalty, misuse of power, working together, Eastern religions, magic, destiny, revenge, healing. Hmm. Missing mass-murder there, fellas. This movie is perfect for queuing up the conversation with little Timmy on why the Jewish kid gets so agitated when he shows up on Halloween wearing his vintage Hitler Youth outfit.The plot drops in without a lot of character development, since we got all that gobbelty-goop out of the way in the first film, but it does fill in all the missing blanks about Po's past and continues with his personal growth. Overall, it's a nice feel-good movie. Except for the murder, I guess. Pay attention at the end of the film for a nice Zionist tip of the hat.If you've got kids, or just need to see something easy after watching some terrible R-rated comedy, then head to see this nicely made feature.",Null,0,1,24 August 2011
Hugo," Hugo - History, Passion, and Art.
","Hugo! Darling Hugo. He lives in the walls in a French train station, fixing clocks and working on a magical little man. He encounters a toy maker who seems horrified at the thought of little mechanical men and the mystery unfolds. I won't spoil anything, but this is based on true events. In fact the most believable part (little French urchin living in a train station) was the fake part. Bravo, real life.Hugo wasn't at all what I was expecting. I though it would be more of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close set in 1910s France – boy searching for the answers to life pertaining to his lost dad. Touching stuff. What I got was a celebration of film sneakily slipped in to a children's movie. From the scenes in the film to the actual clips shown as part of Hugo's journey to discovery, everything paid homage to the classics – Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Voyage to the Moon, - every piece of film celebrated the art. As someone who grew up on old films, I really enjoyed seeing these greats back on the big screen. They even got laughs from folks I suspect never knew these treasures existed.That's not to say that every part of this modern film wasn't also spectacular. The opening shot made me dizzy, the colors were dazzling and rich, and even the costuming showed great attention to detail. Scorsese hasn't been my favorite director, but I appreciate his skill and his love of film. Well done to all involved, this is one of my favorites of the year!",Null,3,5,16 December 2011
Warrior," Not the worse movie I've ever seen, but it didn't have enough action to hold my attention
","Spoiler alert: this review will spoil not only Warrior, but possibly a few other movies. And off we go I understand the irritation with Warrior trailers, really I do. The first time I had a real issue with spoiler trailers was with Just Like Heaven. Yeah yeah, chick flick and all, but the first trailers made it seem a little interesting. Who is this mysterious ghost woman? If you go to a lot of movies, later trailers reveal that she's in a coma somewhere. Seriously? That's amazing, now I can save a few bucks/hours. Corpse Bride followed the same annoying trend – mystery, less mystery, oh what they heck here's the whole movie. Warrior definitely lost an element of tension, but I didn't feel like it took too much away from the film.Warrior follows the lives of two brothers (who end up fighting each other for the championship!) – one is an ex-Marine, appearing under mysterious circumstances and an absolute animal in the cage, while the 2nd was a mildly successful fighter turned teacher who has to go all the way to save his house, pride, and pretty Blond Doctor wife. Add gravely drunk Nick Nolte as the vaguely abusive father, and we've got our cast. The two are fighting for noble reasons, but in the end, only one brother may leave the championship that match that they are certainly going to fight against each other. Did I mention – THEY'RE BROTHERS!?I wanted to see this movie for two reasons only: Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy. Edgerton is part of the award-winning Blue Tongue Film collective and Tom Hardy is kind of insane but a fun actor. The problems started early with Tommy's (Tom Hardy) brooding homecoming with his father. This first and very emotional scene could have been a great start to an action/drama, but it had an awkward vagueness that plagued every scene throughout the film. Tommy's father did something, but they don't come out and say it. His brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) uses the same language – 'Yeah, phone or letter – after that THING you did.' What thing? What did he do? Tommy and Brendan finally meet/argue/hash in an amazing chance meeting on the Atlantic City beaches before their big fight and they too argue about that plan that Brendan didn't follow through on WHAT PLAN? I've got to imagine it's as ridiculous to watch two people argue about as it would by to attempt that kind of thing in real life. I think I'll pick a fight with my wife about something I didn't like, but never actually come out and say it. I might be The Sad Man tomorrow, but it could be fun.There were a host of other problems with this film – pacing, edits, the entire believability of any actions, the premise that anybody can lose their house these days after a few late payments – but there was one redeeming aspect – THE FIGHTING. I'm not an MMA fan, but I do like well shot action. Every moment in the ring was intense, chaotic, and made you feel every massive hit. The sound design reinforced the brutal beat downs that Tommy administered and Brendan received. I've had the chance to sit 2nd row at an MMA event, and even that close, it's just a bunch of slappy-sounding hits and grunting. Warrior gave us what we really wanted – bone-crushing hits, flips, tosses, and general mayhem in the ring. The intense, sweat and emotion laden choke-out at the end of the championship match could have been the most amazing moment in cinema history given all the great action, but I had laughed at the drama far too many times take it seriously at that point.What went wrong? I think Warrior had the several writer problem like Cowboys & Aliens. Too many writers, too many plot lines vying for attention. My good friend Ryan pointed out that the story should have been told from one character's point of view. It never had a focus and tried to cover too many perspectives at a time. Lose the 90′s high school kids, lose the wife with no convictions, cut some of the drawn out scenes, and you might have a movie.While not the worse movie I've ever seen, it didn't have enough action to hold my attention for the nearly two and a half hour runtime.",Null,5,17,12 September 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fincher adds a liberal dash of dull to a great story.
","You may or may not be familiar with the original Girl movies from Sweden or Norway or wherever they don't speak the Lord's fine language, but they do exist. Made for TV, but containing unfiltered images of the sex, violence, and perversion from the thriller, the original trilogy was a great tribute to a now passed author. WHat's that Hollywood? You know what's good for us? This isn't a review of the originals, but they do bear mentioning since the Fincher feature is intended (and being hailed) as a superior version.Mikael Blomkvist is a simple investigative reporter – he wants the biggest names in corporate corruption to fall. When he gets raked through the courts for a huge financial loss, he slips out of the public view taking a job solving a long standing murder for a strange wealthy family living on an island in north wherever. He soon figures out there's more to the single incident and employs the services Hot Topic poster girl Lisbeth Salander as his chief researcher. She's unhinged, but has the uncanny ability to hack EVERYTHING using the Mac OS – a feat worthy of praise, for sure. Mystery unfolds, solves, and it only took 2 hours and 40 minutes.In typical Fincher fashion, everything was grass-growing slow. It's a thriller, but even the climax contained long, riveting scenes of Lisbeth flipping through old records, getting coffee, walking, walking, walking, riding elevators there's pacing and then there's self-indulgence. Thankfully Queer had graciously tossed me a free large soda coupon, so I filled my time by drinking, eliminating, and refilling several times. Choosing the flavoring for my soda = most exciting part of my evening.Daniel Craig really could have been anybody. It's not really his fault, Mikael isn't a very complex character. He's thoughtful, passive, and likes his little trysts (don't we all?), but never really has any intentions other than the ever-noble seeking the truth. Rooney Mara got the real gem – Lisbeth Salander with her stormy past, violent nature, and unfettered lust. Through the talented (and, funny, English- speaking) Noomi Rapace, the character has some maturity and more control in the crazed moments. Rooney Mara never broke from a sullen, pouty demeanor until the absurd final minutes of the film where she suddenly goes all Tin Man and finds a heart telling a brain-dead old man 'I made a friend!' Rapace was a terrifyingly unhinged woman, Mara was a pouting teenager.It's more than just the dull pacing and flat characters that made this movie boring as dirt, it was the entire experience. The Trent Reznor score sounded like someone leaning on a keyboard, the locations had zero deviation from the original, the accents fluttered somewhere between Swedish and British, and product placement overran the screen at all times. Far from the gritty source material, the film spewed out the watered-down, pretentious Hollywood version of edgy.The one positive – first film I've seen shot on RedOne that had a beautiful cinema look to it. Too bad everything else couldn't match the picture quality.Critics may fawn over Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and probably the subsequent two films, but I think I'll be taking the Twilight route and skipping the rest of the series having had the taste of the first.",Null,52,79,3 January 2012
District 9," Great idea, poor script.
","Summer of ought nine has really disappointed for sci-fi/fantasy movie fans. Harry Potter was long and boring, GI Joe made children cry, but there was hope with the very cool looking District 9. I skipped into the theater and plopped down with my Diet Coke and Taco Bell to enjoy what would certainly be the best movie of the summer. Looking at the movie ratings here you'd think it was, but never underestimate the power of fans who thought they went to see Halo. Like I said, the film had a great idea. I'm sure the short film was a great preview for the feature, but somewhere in fleshing out the script Neill Blomkamp went horribly wrong. Maybe it's the obsession with trying to be a writer/director that kept him from checking with other writers to see if there were any, I don't know, massive plot holes or something, but it was so ponderous and scattered near the end, I didn't know what I was watching. The idea: aliens are stranded because they are too dumb to get their ship working again. The plot: guy accidentally starts transforming into an alien, find that two of them happen to know what's going on, but have been sucking goo out of motherboards for 20 years to get enough fuel to get back onto their ship. One gets killed, guy helps for selfish reasons and suddenly becomes compassionate. At least give the guy a son so he can suddenly realize he would do the same for his son...I could write a companion guide on the plot problems, but here are a few of my favorite: -They can drive out of a building in an armored car, but nobody seems to notice except for that one guard who shot at them (and apparently dropped the ball on telling anybody later). -1 million aliens can be kept at bay with a chain link fence. -(stolen from sikboy21) Should you be infected and slowly changing into a alien creature rest assured that despite never encountering your species before the aliens know how to reverse the process.Two other trends in film-making were present here as well: 1) Humans are evil. And I mean all of them. There's been anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-whoever, but the anti-the Earth movies have been on the rise. What gives? 2) Shaky cam! I'm tired of it, and it doesn't make sense. When it's documentary style, that's fine. Once you're watching a 3rd person narrative, it needs to stop. My fiancée almost puked because of all the motion.",6,4,8,17 August 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Bird Delivers Abrams' Goods
","Brad Bird, oh you masterful animator. You made me cry with Iron Giant, grip the edge of my seat watching The Incredibles, and laugh raucously with the jokes of Rattatouille. Now on to live action, rewarded with the cream of the money crop – the incredibly successful Tom Cruise/Mission Impossible franchise. Bird has the chance to show that animation isn't his only gig.Mission: Impossible 4 opens up with a mission gone wrong and a fun, brutal prison escape that (re)introduces the cast of characters. Once we get that nonsense out of the way – on to the mission. Using high tech gadgetry, fast thinking, and smooth talking, the crack team manages to take down a man set to destroy they world. Once again, the team makes it look easy exceptThey didn't. Everything went wrong – 'Red is Dead' – gadgets broke, team members made mistakes, and nothing went quite as planned. It ended up being a major miracle that anything got done at all. It was sort of strange seeing this sort of plot and character development out of a normally polished action series, but I'll give the credit to Brad Bird. Previous Bird films felt very realistic, even when the subject was talking rats in a French kitchen. He has a knack for bringing real issues and conflicts in to otherwise insanely outlandish stories. Maybe I'm giving him too much credit, but Ep. 4 was different enough from most action movies to make me thing J.J. Abrams gave Bird a good bit of leeway in film making.Beyond the nice bits of conflict, it was very nice film making. I could actually tell who was who and what was going where during action scenes. Smooth camera movement took precedence over shaky cam and 'gritty' shooting styles. Just how I like it. Top it off with some gutwrenching sound effects and you've got a complete film.Ghost Protocol wasn't perfect by any means. It had a lot of product placement, some goofy dialog, could have used a trim here and there but it was probably one of the more enjoyable films I saw in 2011. I don't often see movies twice, but when I do, it would be this one.",Null,4,8,1 February 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A great story ruined by laughable CGI
","Remakes, sequels, and prequels – oh my! You can't go one week without encountering one of these. August is particularly ridiculous – we have Conan the Barbarian (IN THREEE DEE!!), Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Fright Night (1985 original), Final Destination 5, Spy Kids (IN FOUR DEE!), and Don't' Be Afraid of the Dark (1973 original). Weigh that against the 5 or 6 wide releases that are (somewhat) original, and we've got a sad state of affairs. At least we have Another Earth and Griff the Invisible providing some indie relief.You can understand my fears at seeing yet another attempt to exploit nostalgia and that 'if it worked once, we can rape their wallets again!' attitude, but I went in with an open mind. Despite my dramatics, I did really want to see Rise. I am, without good reason, a James Franco fan and the trailer was gripping. CGI looked pretty cheesy, but I can sometimes get past that. Sometimes.James Franco plays brilliant researcher Will Rodman who is on the brink of cracking Alzheimer's with the drug ALZ-112. I've tried to find any trivia behind the name, but honestly it just appears to stand for Alzheimer's and the trial number. How will film students ever find hidden meaning!?!? Anyhoo, the drug shows great promise in one particular chimp, but she goes haywire leaving behind a genetically superior ape-child later named Caesar. Showing compassion, but mostly playing God, Rodman takes Caesar home and raises him as a brilliant child-pet. Caesar, like all good chimps, eventually goes never mind, I'm not making that joke. He is interred at an ape concentration camp and that's where the Rise begins.The movie really had me torn. On one hand, I really liked the story. Caesar's growth and changes were subtle, although the turning point against Rodman seemed a bit arbitrary. On the other hand, the CGI was okay at best and really goofy at worst. Let's talk story first.I couldn't really tell what the writers were going for with Caesar and the other apes – racial discrimination, the Holocaust, Roman citizenship ideals – all of these elements appear in one way or the other through some of the, at times, heavy-handed plot devices (you're welcome, film students). Obviously as Caesar, he was destined to be the great general to lead his people to victory, and he did just that. Another picking point for me was the portrayal of pre-ALZ-113 apes. They were smart. Really smart. I know apes have the potential to be very smart, but not as smart as they were. Perhaps Caesar had already given them a mild infection with his smart-virus, but all of the schoolyard bullying sequences at the ape sanctuary seemed far-fetched and overplayed. Beyond those points, the story had simplicity that I didn't expect. I'm not complaining – I'd rather have a well crafted, simple story than a movie with so many twists and turns that it eventually writes itself in to a corner and ends unsatisfactorily. Rise definitely crafted its key moments well, despite my complaints.The CGI will hurt this movie in my final grade. A-grade story, C-grade CGI. I get that motion capture has come a long way, but it still looks goofy when you have any sort of extreme motion like running, jumping – you know, all of the action parts of the movie. The climax really became laughable with the exaggerated, unnatural motions of the CGI apes swarming the Golden Gate Bridge. Any of Caesar's movements made by Andy Serkis were appropriate and natural, but since he can't swing around, that's where it got odd. I was able to overlook this with one ape, but a whole army of them was just too much.The story did a good job of setting up the originals, although the utterance of The Line made me roll my eyes, but the CGI took me out of the movie at key points and really set it on a downward trajectory once the action ramped up.",Null,1,3,24 August 2011
Drive," Drive had no heart, no character, no mercy, but it did provide a visual feast to offset the boredom.
","Drive is the latest film by one of the prettiest directors out there – Nicolas Winding Refn. That's not a Queer thing to say, I just mean that he makes pretty pictures that go in your eyes and made your brain a little soft. The only arguably prettier director could be Zach Snyder, but he has managed to obscure his visual talent with offensively stupid stories.Drive opens with a Transporter-style scene with our title character 'Driver' – he don't need no stinkin' name – shuttling some crooks around town in their getaway car. We then get a sappy little tale of him saying one or two words to his next door neighbor, played by the child- like Carey Mulligan. I wanted to like An Education. I really wanted to like Never Let Me Go, but I don't get the hype. Whatever, she's in it, but like all the characters, she could really have been anybody. Manly man Ron Perlman showed up as a mob boss, Christina Hendricks' finer qualities showed up long enough to warrant a name on the poster but nobody cares. Driver drives, fights, stares and stares and stares and stares, bleeds a bit, and the movie ends.I'd love to talk more about story, but there's not much to say. It's an overused plot about some guy getting in over his head, yadda yadda, pays the price or gets away despite the odds. Pointless dialog punctuated with long, long pauses on characters. It'd have an impact if there was anything to ruminate on during the silence, but it just turned in to a staring match between Ryan Gosling and the audience. Here's an example of the Memorable Quotes from IMDb:Irene: 'That's Benicio's father.'Driver: 'Where is he?'Irene: 'In prison.'Driver: 'Oh.'Inspiring! But really that's not the point. Here's why I'm giving this movie a better grade than it deserved: it was good film making. It was brutal, bloody, with great car chases and fight scenes. It became nearly grindhouse near the end with all the nasty deaths and ridiculous fights. I stayed for the entire credits and didn't see the usual host of visual effects houses. There are 9 visual effects folks in the credits. There are far more stunt people, art department members, and post sound crew. Refn can get what he needs from the camera and doesn't need to alter the end product with poor CGI decisions.Drive had no heart, no character, no mercy, but it did provide a visual feast to offset the boredom.",Null,4,9,22 September 2011
Insidious," There's a bunch of evil-type things and stuff
","The Writing of 'Insidious': A Screenplay in One ActINT. WRITERS ROOM – NIGHTJAMES WAN sits at a table with 4 tired-looking WRITERS.JAMES WANOkay fellas! I got this story it's about a kid who, like, has his spirit wander away and it can't find it's way back. There's a bunch of evil-type things trying to get at his body to take it over. What do we call it??WRITERS (shouting)Evil-thing! Devious! Crafty! Dubious! Insidious! The Purple Scare!JAMES WANWait, what was that? Insidious? Hmm. In. Sin. Insini. Sindi. IOU. Good good, it can go any way. Make sure some of those letters are in RED on the movie poster. Yeah. Okay, good work. Now, his soul is trapped in this place that's sort of hazy, like a haunted house, but not nearly as fun. Stuff JUMPS OUT AT YOU! That's scary. Don't talk to me. I made SAW. I'm thinking of calling this place. THE FURTHER.WRITERSUh, shouldn't that be THE FARTHER?JAMES WANSHUT UP! If you remember Dead Silence you know I know the difference between further and that other word. Moving on! So the movie opens with some weird stuff happening. The kid's soul hasn't wandered off yet, but there's still demon things. And then they get stronger. And stronger. Then we introduce some wacky nerd types, because they're funny. We end with a crazy twist that nobody could see coming! But you've all read the script. I think it's perfect and we're starting the shoot tomorrow.WRITERSAren't you concerned that no family has ever interacted like your Hollywood-perfect family in this script?JAMES WAN (confident, but annoyed)It doesn't matter. Go with it.WRITERSAnd why are there weird things happening before the kid is lost. I mean, nobody is really looking for his empty body when his soul is still in it.JAMES WAN (getting more agitated)It doesn't matter. Nobody will notice. Nobody.WRITERSAnd why do they need his body anyway? By the end of the movie they're capable of moving around in the living world, opening doors, and attacking people. That doesn't seem consistent with your earlier description of the situation.JAMES WAN (his voice low, teeth clenched)IT..DOESN'T.. MATTERWRITERSAnd this twist. Who are you, M. freakin' Night? That's crap. That's not scary. This entire script is crap. Were you drunk when you wrote this? This will take months to fix!JAMES WAN (screaming)That's IT! You're all fired! You'll never work in Hollywood again! I'm James Wan! I'm James Wan!!!!! I'm James WAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!JAMES WAN raises his fist to the sky, cursing the script gods and mankind alike. Soon, soon he would unleash Insidious on the world and nothing would stop him!END",Null,2,5,24 August 2011
The Number 23," A subtle thriller spoof
","I want to draw a mustache or something on the poster, but there's no more room left (yuk yuk yuk). I also learned I can't spell 'mustache.' It's an elephant word, give me a break!Jim Carrey had a great performance in The Truman Show. He was entertaining even up until Fun With Dick and Jane.Alrighty, now that I'm done saying nice things about Carrey, let me tell you what I thought about this movie. It was a good to okay movie if it had been cast with talented actors. Virginia Madsen will always be a TV actress in my mind, Logan Lerman's mom needs to fire his agent, and Jim Carrey...well.. maybe retirement is a good idea. The acting was laughably bad. I laughed about 20 minutes in by myself, but everybody joined in by the one hour mark. In the end it was just sooo over the top bad that it almost seemed to be spoofing itself. Although a week has blotted most of this horror from my mind, I can still hear him saying 'I don't deserve your love, Ag. I don't deserve anyone's love', and the 'LAUGH' sign came on over the screen and the crowd went wild.THE KID'S NAME WAS ROBIN SPARROW. Holy bad naming conventions, Batman! Sheesh that's just horrible! When you're entering your 5th hour (film number 2 or 4 for the day) of sitting in the movie theater, it gets to where you don't really find things like this to be all that cute and get annoyed.Also, Owen Glieberman does huge amounts of drugs before he screens movies, and gave this a B+, and was the one of the only critics on RT to rate this movie 'fresh'.You may think this post was pretty random, but if you count the number of words in this post, and divide them into the number above it equals 22068821 rounded down. And when you do the math 2+2+0+0+6+8+8-2-1 you get 23 and I didn't even plan that. It just goes to show that that whole movie was stretching for the 23 thing.",Null,0,1,25 August 2011
Ghost Rider," Please, please, no sequel, please!
","The story of a flaming (hehehehe) motorcycle rider, this tale was typical of comic book movies - pass the crackers, cause we got cheese! Now in searching IMDb, I uncovered some facts about the movie that explain pretty much everything I'm going to say about it:-Nicolas Cage had to have his Ghost Rider tattoo covered with make-up in order to play Johnny Blaze (Ghost Rider).-Nicolas Cage wrote sections of the script.-Nicolas Cage's hairpiece required three hours to apply every day.I'll go ahead and explain the first one: If Nick Cage has a tattoo of it, it's not cool. If he had a tattoo of a woman somewhere on his body, I'd probably be celibate for the rest of my life (or until Cage dies). If he had a car tattoo, I'd be walking. Okay, it's not funny any more. Moving on.This movie had issues from the beginning. It's based on a pretty cheesy concept and comics aren't really known for their amazing dialog (see: Nick Cage wrote parts of the script), unless it's rewritten by MightyGodKing. Also, the CG required to create a skeleton on fire is just massive and they really didn't put the budget into CG (see: Nick Cage's daily hairpiece sessions. And if you've seen this hair, it's nothing that couldn't have been done with gel and a quick hand-mussing job - seriously, click on the poster to see it bigger.). The movie also had the same problem as Blade 3, Italian Job, etc in that it had a weak ending. There was no suspense, and the ending only served to set up a sequel (I'll be back and we'll fight then!).There were some good things.Oh, you want me to discuss? Okay. Eva Mendes and Raquel Alessi were both quite cute in their roles. Eva Mendes even was a bit humorous, which I didn't expect since I'm not really a fan of her acting or face (maybe it's the man-jaw). The scene where Ghost Rider scales the building was pretty awesome. Nick Cage's abs with his shirt off were... yanno, I'd say good looking, but they weren't. His 6 pack was all different sizes and shapes, like an squished pack of hot dog buns, which is proof that old people should give up the muscular look when everything gets weird and flabby.Nothing much else to say about this movie, except to write to your congress people and ask that a sequel be outlawed. We haven't had a new amendment in a while, and I think we can all get behind this one.",Null,0,1,25 August 2011
Cars 2," Lovely graphics, overplayed characters, and a weak plot.
","If there's any company I would kill to work for more than Google, it'd be Pixar. I think John Lasseter is brilliant. He could easily be described as the Lucas of animation – vision, drive, extreme creativity and organization – but he's missed the mark on more that one occasion with A Bug's Life and the first Cars movie. Maybe he should be creatively steering the company, not directing – don't continue to be a Lucas.Cars 2 centers on a sort spy story crossed with complete incompetence. Think Johnny English with a little Naked Gun thrown in, but less slapstick and more characters screaming 'WHOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAA' every five minutes. The trailers promised cool race scenes set in exotic locations, much like Speed Racer, but never really delivered on any good car action (ha!). I try to view kids movies as a kid – enjoying the pretty colors, loud sounds, and over-the-top action. Cars 2 never grabbed my interest – too many cluttered sets, scattered plot, and too much Larry the Cable Guy.I'm not opposed to big-name voice actors when they get in to a character (I almost forgot Jack Black was voicing Poalmost), but Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy are completely overbearing in any situation. They ruined what could have been a fun kid movie in Cars and crushed the life out of Cars 2. I suppose when the lynch-pin of your story relies on a character voiced by a Southern hick persona created by a Mid-Western comedian, you might take a big gamble. Unfortunately critics and moviegoers reinforced Pixar's decisions in a big way opening weekend and without a doubt an annoying Cars 3 will hit theaters in a few years.I can't review a Pixar film without touching on the beautiful art of animation. Every shiny bit, piece of dust, fleck of water was art in motion. Pixar, hands down, is killing everybody when it comes to CG animation. I would love to see them take on visual effects for a live- action film. I think they could up the standard for the rest of the industry, not that it stops DreamWorks from cranking out their junk every 4 months. It's a shame they didn't have the typical strong story to compliment the talent in the animation department.While the lovely graphics raised Cars 2 to watchable levels, overplayed characters and a weak plot don't do much for this movie. Even the short felt phoned in with recycled Toy Story characters and sets. At least I got to see the Brave trailer. Mmm.",Null,1,1,24 August 2011
Children of Men," A lot of potential that fell far short
","This movie had so much potential for a great story, but didn't come through at all. Mankind can't have children, but it's never really explained too well. Some girl has a kid, don't know why. We've got to get the mother to some place, not sure why. People get killed, not sure why. There's no tension, no obstacles to overcome - basically the Italian Job of 'sci-fi.'Technical problems: the action one-take follow shot is great for war scenes, but not for a conversational scene. Shooting an entire movie in this look is disorienting and annoying. Sound design was atrocious as well, with every character having a crystal clear voice, despite being outdoors or in an echo-y corridor.Acting by Clive Owen was very mechanical and emotionless. He was a reluctant hero, but had a permanent look of 'What, where am I?' on his face. The rest of the cast was poorly developed, which really made me care very little when they were taken out of the storyline.With my griping out of the way, let me touch on the good. The locations were beautifully gritty. All of the abandoned buildings and the refugee camp footage was very well put together. There was some good humor that broke up the film a bit and made it not so tedious to watch. Some good action sequences in there as well, and a bit of brutal violence that surprised me a little.All in all, a film with a lot of potential that fell far short. It's hardly a sci-fi film, and its attempts to be artistic made it frustrating to watch.",Null,3,5,25 August 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," This dime tour of NYC did not impress or entertain
","This review will contain a few spoilers. Here's the first one: it's mediocre at best.Philip K. Dick shorts could fuel Hollywood for years. They're nice, well thought out premises that aren't so complicated that they leave viewers confused – movies like Minority Report and Total Recall. However when you put a good short in the hands of someone like George Nolfi, the clown responsible for penning Timeline and Ocean's Twelve, you get The Adjustment Bureau.The movie starts out as a quirky rom-com with lead man Matt Damon losing a Senatorial election and find comfort in the arms of a flirty girl hiding in the men's room. Such stuff as dreams are made on. He has a chance meeting with her again some time later, but the big twist occurs when he's confronted by the partners of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, told it's just not meant to be and angels will kneecap him if he spills the beans about their big operation. Years later, we get a replay of the situation and it all goes to heck in a knapsack when The Adjustment Bureau says it must not be.There are a few big problems with how this movie handles the thriller aspects. First, you have to care about characters for any chase or conflict to even matter. We get a slew of sappy Notebook-esque lines with little character development. As far as I'm concerned, David Norris is a childish flake and Elise Sellas doesn't give two craps about anybody's feelings but her own. Not very likable, but I guess they do deserve each other. Second, a thriller won't be thrilling if there is no danger. The biggest dangers are Norris not being a great politician and Sellas not becoming famous in modern dance circles. No threat of bodily harm and the bad guys are completely befuddled when water is in the picture. I've ranted in the past about this Hollywood notion that unless you get the girl AND the money, fame, and good looks, it's not worth it. For most of us, finding true love would be enough – we wouldn't have to be President on top of all that. Last, all throughout the movie the plucky 'buddy comedy' music doesn't give the a sense of impending doom. If Richard Widmark's brutal wheelchair down the stairs scene from Kiss of Death had been accompanied by bongos and a symbol hit at the end, I don't think it would carry the same weight.Maybe we've seen too many Matrix-type movies to be impressed by mind- bending sci-fi chases, but this dime tour of NYC did not impress or entertain.",Null,19,31,23 August 2011
Super 8," Grand-scale adventure capped off with realistic-looking action
","This had to have been my first midnight showing in 2 years. For one, nobody in Maine keeps anything open past 10PM even on the weekends (they fear wolves, I think), but mostly there just isn't a crowd. We drove 40 miles to the incredible Magic Lantern Theater and shared an intimate screening with 4 other folks, including 2 theater employees. Everyone else completely missed out – there was energy in the room from the tiny crowd that matched the feeling when I first saw the trailer. 'Here it is,' I thought, 'finally a movie that is done like a classic sci-fi thriller. If anybody can do this, J. J. Abrams and his attention to detail will pull it off.'Super 8 opens strong with an event that sets up our hero, Joe Lamb's, chain of events. There are a lot of things that the trailers have been misleading on and intentional about keeping quiet, so I won't spoil those moments. The first shot is one of those – defining moment with a lot of ambiguity that clears as the movie progresses. After we introduce the stellar cast of kids, it doesn't take long for the massive train wreck (literally, not in the story sense like most films) that sets the weird rolling.I started sweating a little bit during that scene – not because it was so tense, but so over the top that Michael Bay would have blushed. I swear that train crashed for 10 minutes. Train cars and debris flew everywhere mostly because the Air Force conveniently peppered their precious cargo train with gasoline tanker cars. Despite that, Abrams quickly redeemed himself with a riveting adventure story told through the simple eyes of children.Casting couldn't have been more perfect. Joel Courtney, with his single impressive IMDb credit, plays a perfect hero just trying to have a childhood and save the girl. His energy and intensity was easily matched by the impressive Elle Fanning. In a sea of raunchy films and slapped-together productions, it was a huge breath of fresh air to simply enjoy good acting and a well-structured story. Was it the most innovated film? Not by a long shot, but what it attempted, it did very very well.A grand-scale adventure capped off with realistic-looking action and a great cast of appropriately aged kids (*cough*I Am Number Four*cough*) made for an incredibly enjoyable film. Stop showing the monster, and take a queue from the old-school movies, Hollywood.",8,3,4,24 August 2011
In Time," A waste of ... time.
","Andrew Niccol has a knack for taking his time. He's a writer/director, so I guess that's part of it. He also takes great care in worldbuilding, creating some of the most interesting universes I've ever seen. Gattaca's world spurned imperfection, The Truman Show's planet was obsessed with one man's life, and The Terminal reduced the world to an airport for a lonely man. All in all, he's a clever Kiwi.I sat through In Time and I'm done praising Niccol.In Time paints a picture not so unlike our own. The poor struggle to make ends meet while the rich live in their walled off sections of the city. The currency is time and the clock starts when you're 25, giving you just one year for free and ample opportunity for time-based jokes. I just don't have the time to tell any right now. BAM! Also just like in our world, when you run out of money, you just drop dead. The poor can't get to the rich parts of town because it takes too muchtime. Enter into the picture pauper factory worker Will Salas ( and his creepily young mother (Olivia Wilde). He has a chance meeting with a wealthy (timely?) man who transfers 100 years into his arm/bank. All heck (heck I tell ya!) breaks loose when he starts getting more time (takes time to make time!) and gives it out, upsetting the balance. The wealthy cannot STAND for this time-rage and time sends time cops to time arrest Time Salas and bring him to time justice. In time.Niccol's previous works were subtle, with a very well-defined world. This one seemed haphazard. How did humanity get to a point where they agree to only live to 26 for free and let the wealthiest live forever? The rich might have power, but there's a heck of a lot of everybody else to violently overthrow that idea. Why did everybody display their personal worth in big, bright letters on their forearm? You'd think if you could be killed for having too much time (liberal arts majors died off quickly), you'd have that little tidbit hidden. Maybe a futuristic HUD so you can tell where you stand without prying eyes craving your goodies. Everything else in the world seemed lazy as well – 50s looking electric retro cars, everybody looking young, no changes in buildings, roads, or restaurants, on and on.Story-wise, it was equally sloppy. It intertwines with the huge logic gaps in the world, but the plot seemed to be an afterthought fueled by a reaction to the financial situations in the world. Less commentary on the human condition (like Niccol's previous films), In Time seemed like an 'if I had my way..' exercise. Neat! We should rob banks and give all the money away. That's totally how the financial system works and won't result in massive inflation or instability. I don't care if you want to take a stance against capitalism or whatever, just don't make it sooo heavy handed. It's like watching a Morgan Spurlock movie, something I rarely enjoy.Top off the suck cake with icing called casting. Justin Timberlake as a poor working stiff? Really? They would have had to try pretty hard to find someone less qualified. I thoroughly enjoy Vincent Kartheiser in Mad Men, but I don't want Pete Campbell in my future sci-fi film. Cillian Murphy, however, was the biggest tragedy of all. I love this man in the not-queerest way possible and I will watch anything he does (also on the list: Jason Statham and Joseph Gordon-Levitt), but he came off as an incomplete character. He seemed confused, as an actor, as to why he was there, what he was doing. The answer to 'what's my motivation?' apparently didn't give him anything to work with. Maybe the answer was 'Time! You're there for time! To stop time!'I shouldn't be so irritated by a movie, but I am. The trailer said 'No, no', but my love of Niccol's past work said 'Yes, maybe.' A waste of film, a waste of time.",Null,1,4,2 November 2011
Thor," A few entertaining moments with an incomplete story
","Oh boy, another Marvel movie! In case you forgot, Marvel has brought us Hulk, Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man 3, Fantastic 4, Special Hulk, Silly Hulk, Elektra, some Punisher movies, and and some iffy X-Men movies. And also Blade, Iron Man, and Men in Black. They have gone from being cheesy comic books and low-budget looking Spider-Man and Hulk TV shows to being very. very. very. serious business. Dark, moody art with special-effects laden films to match.Thor to me isn't that interesting of a superhero concept. He has the same problem as Superman: invincibility. Krypton can at least mess with Superman, but Thor has nothing – other than good ol' dad stripping him of his power. Nevertheless, my wife and I saw a Monday night screening IN THREE DIMENSIONS with about 4 other folks. Helpful hint for you movie-goers: don't recycle your Real-D glasses. Pocket them, come back to buy the 2D version, and sneak in to the 3D version. You've already paid for those bad boys once with your first movie ticket, so no harm done in my theft book.The original Thor story begins with mild-mannered cripple Donald Blake discovering he is actually Thor, God of Thunder. He leaves his cripply self behind when he picks up that sweet hammer. New Thor may have lost his powers, but his good looks did not get stripped away. I guess it would be harder to be humble if you were still a beefcake blond. While some folks spent the movie drooling over Chris Hemsworth's pecs and tittering at Kat Denning's quirky antics, I actually paid attention to the story – what little I could find.Thor felt like a ridiculously long intro to Thor 2. Like it should have been an extra on the DVD, except it ran for over 2 freakin' hours. It also played heavily towards Marvel fans and not towards us unedjumukated masses – references to S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury, Iron Man, and who knows what else I missed. Keeping each superhero in his own little world and movie has worked well up to this point. I believe The Avengers will be the final 'this is crap' moment for most non-comic movie goers. So I'm supposed to believe that Thor, immortal god, teams up with the Hulk, Iron Man, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Captain America? And this is the same universe that has Spider-Man, who was infected by an alien being (what realm was he from?) and all of the mutant X-Men (Wikipedia tells me Wolverine even joins the Avengers at some point!)? I know we have to suspend a LOT of disbelief to watch the movies, but they all have their own rules and ideas. Mash them together, rules start to break down, and it becomes arbitrary after a while.I realize have not said much about the movie. There isn't much to say. It took 45 minutes to get to Earth and another 45 minutes to leave. In the meantime we got a few lame jokes and some decent CGI action. This wasn't a cheap movie to make, I'm sure. Why shoehorn in a Thor movie before The Avengers just so the characters are all accounted for by little last-minute Nick Fury scenes?While the Ultimate Aryan had a few entertaining moments and a surprisingly good cast, it failed to do more than throw as much information on the screen as possible while leaving an obviously incomplete story behind.

WALL·E," A masterpiece, emotional and fun at the same time
","I have a serious problem with this film. I have alienated my mother-in- law and many friends because of this movie. It's not like it was with Garden State – I'd instantly have no respect for someone who loooooved that film and it chaaaaaange their liiiiiiiife. Understandable, I think. This movie I loved. To put things into perspective, I have a pretty strong 'never watch twice' policy for movies – there's just too many of them to see to waste time and there are few that I enjoy so much, I'll watch twice. I have watched WALL-E probably 12-15 times. I own the DVD (one of about 10 I own, including the entire Futurama set). I have a copy of the Blu-ray at work hidden from my wife who told me not to buy it. I have a Blu-ray player at work, so I can 'test' HD systems. and watch WALL-E. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE.Here's where the problem begins. I loan out one of my other copies of the movie to someone who has not seen the film. On a rare occasion someone comes back with the movie and says the loved it. We are now best friends and they are allowed to use my car and eat my food. Many people come back and say 'Aw, that was a cute movie!' I ask them if they think it should have gotten at least a a Best Picture nod, and while I really loved Slumdog Millionaire, didn't they think that an animation could easily stand up to those films, especially The Reader – ha! Who cares about stupid Kate Stupid Winslet and her nazi reading bullcrap. So they stare at me. There are a very few that come back and say, without fail, these words: 'It was boring.'BORING? Like a sunrise over a tropical island boring? Are you colorblind? Were you born at the age of 60, demanding fiber and hating everything good in this world?Andrew Stanton has created some of the most memorable films in the past 15 years: Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, and the list goes on. Why would a man capable of such amazing stories that entertain young and old create something 'boring.' Maybe he believes the art of animation isn't just for kiddie cartoons, and that it can express beauty, humanity, and world-themes through unconventional means. Maybe he thinks that creative sound design can tell a story that no human voice could have expressed. Who knows, but I do know that WALL-E was an incredible moment for me when I saw what a team of dedicated, creative people could do with a bunch of computers, software, and passion for their art.I don't really think I need to review the content of WALL-E. We know it's about a little robot who is plucky and courageous, risks his life for true love, and in the end gets the girl. We know it has some incredible scenery that are hard to believe are computer generated. We know that the wacky side-kick is expressed through a cockroach in a way that makes us uncomfortable, but impressed that it could be done. We know that the sounds that came from Ben Burtt's imagination were so realistic and deeply human, that it made us forget we were watching a couple of robots in a trash-filled wasteland.I know some people will find The Triplets of Belleville a bit grotesque and strange. I know not everybody appreciates Charlie Chaplin as Hitler in a comedy. But to watch this movie and then dismissively call it 'boring' without at least recognizing the significance of the film and the technological achievement that it represents, even while missing the story altogether well, I pity you. And hate you.",Null,1,3,24 August 2011
Rango," An interesting movie if you're in the mood for something odd
","Rango's trailer really contains everything truly funny in the movie. Normally this would be a problem for a hilarious children's movie, but apparently only the first 5 minutes of the film were delivered and marketing went off running to promote a funny kid's film. Painted in a palate of grays and browns, Rango is a gritty western with an odd assortment of grizzly animals that are so water-starved, they've started talking with Texas accents (and some British). Rango comes along like a fish out of water and uses his charm and filthy lizard lies to endear himself to the townspeople, eventually solving the crisis and living happily with some rodent.While the story didn't come across as terribly creative, it was the dirty details that got me. Rango's first exposure to the desert sun results in two quick skin-sheddings – a scene that I rewatched 10 times, cringing each time. Kids movies generally approach death like-a so: there's some comical violence throughout, maybe some threats to life and limb, but at the climax of the film the uncontested villain of the movie finally gets his through a noncommittal death. Think sabre-toothed tiger in Ice Age and Captain Hook in Peter Pan (we all know he was dismembered by the croc). In Rango, death comes constantly and brutally – drowning, crushing, falling, and being shot. There is no mercy, but the animals do act as animals and don't seem to care. The movie also had some beautiful landscapes, tributes to other movies, and so much sand and dirt.I don't really attribute much of the movie to Gore Verbinski. Having seen how companies like Pixar work, a lot of the little details that make a film come from the animators themselves, not the story or the director. He'll thumbs up/thumbs down, but these are ideas originating in a far more creative place. The story was not very compelling or original, but everything else made up for those shortcomings. I wasn't particularly impressed by Johnny Depp, who seemed to be channeling a mixture of Kermit the Frog and Sam Rockwell playing Zaphod Beeblebrox. I couldn't even recognize the voices of every other cast member and I think that speaks to voice work more than being easily recognizable. Whatever it takes to sell a ticket, I suppose.Speaking of selling tickets at all cost, the one thing that took what would have been an A-range movie in to the B's was the idiotic punch- ups. Knowing the studio and director, it probably went like this: 'Wow, that was really dark. Can't you, uh, make it funnier for kids? Like add some crotch shots and farts? Thanks a bunch, buddy!' And add them they did! During random, surreal scenes, audiences were treated to some animal farting. I'd say that might have been to add to the bizarreness of the movie, but again, knowing the studio and director, that's doubtful. Some poor animator was tasked with going back and adding a puff of feathers or sand so some poor sound designer could go back and add a stupid fart sound. Well done, you masters of subtlety.While Rango was no El Topo (not enough midgets), it had some surreal moments. It's probably one of the most interesting animations I've ever watched, although I can't say I enjoyed it as much as HTTYD or Wall-E. Still, a pretty interesting movie if you're in the mood for something odd.",Null,0,0,24 August 2011
X-Men: First Class," A comic movie for the non-comic viewer
","What do you do when Bret Ratner crash lands the last in a great set of films? Well, first you make sure he has nothing to do with any more of them and second you want turn back time and hopefully reset the X-Men clock to before Ratner passed X-Men: The Last Stand onto a film reel. Comics are all about alternate universes – let's enter one where the directors, actors, and storyline are thought out and entertaining.Just with the folks involved, this movie had a great chance of being at least good. I have thoroughly enjoyed every one of Matthew Vaughn's films from Layer Cake to, most recently, Kick-Ass. Given a bigger budget, I knew he would be capable of more. Two of the writers were also on Thor (uh-oh), but I'm sure Vaughn and Jane Goldman reeled them back to reality. Top off the talent with James McAvoy as Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Magneto. There was a brilliant mix of established talent and new faces. Nobody was a nobody, but I'll bet this is the first time since Mad Men that you recognized January Jones on screen.So we're back in time with the start of X-Men. Sure they've been around, but they didn't get their catchy nicknames or skin-tight suits until this moment. Speaking of skin-tight suits, it's amazing how every movie tries to justify with a scientific explanation why the female characters need super-cleavage inducing suits. Can't we just gloss over a reason and all get along? I'd rather leave the cool action to the big screen – I really can't describe how nice everything turned out. Great explosions, very nice period settings. We get requisite TV shots of Kennedy saying 'Cuber' so we all know what year we're in. What I can talk about (since this is a critical critics review) is character development.If I had any complaint, it would be wanting more character growth. By this point we know a lot about Prof. X and Magneto. Don't twist my words in your angry mind, comic-book reader, I liked seeing that initial relationship and falling out. I also loved seeing Mystique's beginnings (played by the crazy-talented Jennifer Lawrence), but there were so many other characters that seemed to be begging for more back story. Even Sebastian Shaw – obviously a very talented mutant – was assumed to just be the evil guy who needed getting. Little was revealed besides his early ties to Magneto. I know it's hard to have a film under 4 hours long with as many characters that populate a mutant environment, but I was left wanting more. It's really a pitiful complaint against an enjoyable film.While X-Men: First Class had it's little comic-type jokes, it generally avoided the cheese factor enough to create a world that us non-comic watchers didn't feel lost in the little inside jokes. With a $65 million opening, I'm hoping Vaughn and the rest of the crew return for more retro-styled X-Men adventures very soon.",Null,0,1,24 August 2011
Win Win," Really wanted there to be bigger emotion, bigger conflict, and more satisfying characters
","I originally saw Win Win at the local sort of art theater (which is currently playing The Guard, The Trip, The Help, and The Debt) on a scratchy print that had obviously been passed around a few times before.The trailer put off this fun, quirky, life's looking up vibe – Paul Giamatti plays chubby lawyer Mike who's just trying work through his wacky problems when his life is interrupted by Rob Schneider! I mean the bleach-blond up and comer Alex Shaffer. Everything gets wicka-wacky fun when his drug-addict mom shows up to reclaim her son with some shady ulterior motives and Amy Ryan gets really sassy. Just goes to show the power of editing.Back up a little. Win Win is mostly actor, sometimes writer/director Thomas McCarthy's third film. I watched his previous film The Visitor in anticipation of seeing Win Win. My micro review: REALLY wanted to like it. Richard Jenkins is fantastic, the premise promises to be kind of awkward but heartwarming, but it didn't ever do anything or go anywhere. I finished the movie, but only because I had nothing else to do at the time.Back to the movie on hand. It did have some funny moments, as promised in the trailer. Bobby Cannavale (Terry) put on a great show as an over- enthusiastic side-kick for Mike delivering some great lines. While I'd never accuse Giamatti of phoning anything in, he seemed to be playing that character he plays – you know, just being Paul Giamatti. Not a bad choice – I really can't see anybody else filling the role, but I felt like I'd seen it all before. Story-wise, I won't spoil the details should you choose to watch (it is a little complicated), but the premise set forth had the same general concept as The Visitor. Mike makes some choices that are sure to come to a head near the end of the film, but like McCarthy's previous film, it really falls flat on resolution. Everything is just too convenient, easy, and really unsatisfying.Perhaps my love of action movies squishes my enjoyment of subtle, quiet family drama, but I really wanted there to be bigger emotion, bigger conflict, and more satisfying characters. Mad Men is a favorite of mine because everyone is so ruthless and emotional, and the characters have some serious flaws. Win Win was a no go for going to any extreme and, as a result, didn't have much of a rise an fall in story for the duration.",Null,2,3,7 September 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A tangled mess that only confused
","This is it: the end of a saga, a massive undertaking that has resulted in so much screen-time, some new stars, Harry Potter becoming a household name, and a disgusting amount of money. Part 1 was barely watchable. Part 2 supposedly had more fighting and action, but I am always skeptical.I had honestly forgotten how the last movie ended. Hint: somebody/thing died. And it's not the last time in the two-parter. While deaths seemed shocking early on in the series of movies, the body count piled up pretty fast as the movie seemed to have no regard for the characters you loved and adored. I'll tell you right now, I didn't like the movie. One of the main reasons was the offhanded manner in which deaths occurred, often as a side note or in the background. If you spend 7 (and a half?) movies molding characters in to either well loved or completely hated, you can give them 2 minutes on-screen to have a proper exit.The poor pacing that plagued Deathly Hallows, Part 1 continued in Part 2 with mix of frantic scenes that seemed to be trying to keep the runtime down followed by moments that dragged on for eternity. What ever happened to building towards a climax? They do a superb job of setting up tension with the attack on Hogwarts by a huge army, but keep interrupting the action with flashbacks and other, less exciting locations. While those were pivotal to telling a complete story, their placement completely derailed any excitement and flow.Some high points of the film do include the battle scenes – magic hasn't looked this good since The Covenant! Those battles only accentuated the slow parts and made me wonder why there weren't more scenes like that in the previous 18 hours of movie. Also very good was a lot of the acting from Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, as well as a lot of the more seasoned cast members. Or maybe they just seemed amazing in comparison to Rupert Grint, who has at this point become even more of a bumbling clown that he's lost all dimensions from earlier films.Overall, the charming, interesting plot lines that started in the first few films has become a tangled mess that only confused me and left me with more questions than the flashbacks and long conversations could explain. I'll completely agree with Queer: this was a pure greed move on the part of the studios. Part 2 could have easily been pared down and shown with a cleaned up Part 1 and not insulted audiences with promises of a better ending this way. At least it's all over, until Rowling decides to write the next big children's hit series that will be successful regardless of its quality.",Null,1,1,24 August 2011
50_50," Who knew cancer could be so entertaining?
","Fat Man is now a big fat Texan. I saw this at my local THIRTY-PLEX. Thirty screens! Big ones too. It's Texas after all.Anything can be a comedy these days, even (supposedly) movies about sewing people stem to stern. The subject matter didn't really give me pause, it was more the nature of the film – quirky indie comedy/drama with wide release, mostly unknown writer and director, Anna Kendrick and Seth Rogen. I do love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and he was the driving force for looking past all these other items. Funny thing was, it did play out like a great indie film and both the knowns and unknowns performed marvelously. I'll get in to that in another paragraph.The movie starts with cautious, nice-guy Adam (Gordon-Levitt) going through the daily gyrations (or not) with girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) and best friend Kyle (Rogen). His persistent back pain turns out to be cancer and makes every hypochondriac in the audience squirm in their seat. After that, there's not a lot of action but lots of self-doubt, poor behavior, and crying and crying and crying. I won't ruin the ending, but it's a little bit of a cliff-hanger to the end. Other than some of the oddities, there's nothing particularly outstanding about the story other than the nicely crafted dialog.I didn't hate Anna Kendrick (Katherine) nearly as much as I thought. She wasn't so. herself in this movie, thanks goodness. Same for Seth Rogen. After the mess of Green Hornet, I realized he's like a lot of actors – they need direction. Give him the right words, and he's amazing. Let him write them and it's really not the same. Speaking of, Will Reiser's script was great. He crafted each character to be consistent, show some growth, and act like a real person. By the end of the movie, you really care about what's going to happen to Adam, you think his girlfriend is a waste of meat, and this whole situation just sucks. Reiser also managed to finish the film strongly. Most movies can be great for the first 2/3, but fall flat in the last act. The emotions continue to build as Adam goes through the stages of dealing with cancer. Maybe it was the fact that this story already had a real life ending, but Reiser definitely had a goal in mind when the film started.Jonathan Levine has come a long way from All the Boys Love Mandy Lane and really impressed me with 50/50. While some of the acting is less than convincing, the story, characters, and technical aspects made it very enjoyable.",Null,0,1,26 October 2011
300," Perhaps the sweatiest movie of all time
","300 was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. If you've talked to me, you're not going to get anything new here as far as my likes and dislikes go.Me likey: The stylized fighting. Green and blue screen work were so well done. It looked just like the comic book and that was something rare to find. Other than Resident Evil: Apocalypse (it's okay to lump comic books and video games together as a genre, right?), I don't think a movie has done justice to its source this well. While incredibly violent, the blood and gore was for the most part 2D - an interesting concept that deserves some kudos (M&M variety, of course). Recap: good fighting.Me no likey: The acting, the plot. I know this was a lowish budget movie, but getting some good actors, or at least a narrator who doesn't sound like he gargles hot metal shavings for breakfast. The plot was true to the comic, but other comic movies have taken liberties with the story it make it a bit more palatable for movie audiences. The real story is well known by many people, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who showed up and though 'well, gee, this fake story would be made so much better by throwing in some historic truths instead of a bunch of weird monsters.' Also true to the comic style, every line was EPIC. That gets annoying fast. Last, sound design. I'm not even going to go there.All in all, it was a very manly movie, what with all the men in leather thongs and covered in sweat. I give it a straight B+ and a gay A-.",Null,0,3,25 August 2011
Fast Five," Everything about this movie says 'terrible', but I still had a great time watching.
","SUMMER. IS. HERE. I am so happy because these are the best movies of the year. I gagged and giggled a little while typing that out whatever, I am an eternal summer flick sucker. The only thing better than seeing a summer flick is seeing one at midnight. Sadly, no midnight movies in MaineOn to the veggies: Fast Five or Fast and the Furious Five or FF or FFF. I was not a fan of these movies until a the last one came out. Not really not a fan, but I just had never watched them. Big mistake on my part. To date, this has been one of the most entertaining series of films other than the Delta Force movies. I was so excited about this movie for three reasons:1) THE ROCK. The star studded (?) cast of FFF could only be improved by adding Dwayne THE ROCK Johnson. He has beefed up and has that strangely sweaty chin-hair, but still won't go by THE ROCK. Maybe when he gets back to wrestling here shortly. I suspect he brought his own writer over from WWE (WWF, I don't follow FAKE wrestling) since his line were some of the stupidest one-liners I have ever heard. I've seen Arthur and Your Highness and I laughed more at FFF than both those movies. ROCK was not the only culprit – the rest of the cast had absurd dialog that matched the over-the-top action.2) Speaking of THE ACTION!! Fast and Furious = hot people racing cars. Huuuuuge letdown in this department. Racing on straight streets, total CGI racing action, and (this made me mad) skipping over the only real street racing scene in the entire movie. I could go on about the physics of towing a 10 ton bank with two muscle cars – coefficient of friction and all – but the internet has that covered.3) Seeing movies with my friend QUEER. That's right, we live over 1000 miles away, but we got to see FFF in the same theater. We laughed. We laughed some more. We complained. We got drinks at the gay bar. Queer is responsible for my terrible movie tastes and love of movies in general. No better way to see a film.Fifth in the series is always iffy. Everything about this movie says 'terrible', but I still had a great time watching. Not to spoil anything, but it looks like we might have a few more movies. Hopefully Vin Diesel will stick with the series until his wattle is wrinkled and dangling.",Null,0,1,24 August 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," It's great.. if you're drunk
","It can be a little difficult getting folks to watch movies with me. For you, dear precious readers, I see just about anything. Apparently everybody else, on their high horses, has taste. But a little alcohol soothes the hate and gets someone to endure with you. I present to you the Transformers 3 Drinking Game!Take a sip when: -Anything transforms. -Anything blows up. -You feel like getting up and walking out.Take a nice big gulp when: -You get the 'Shia Stutter' – 'No no no no no no', 'Get down get down get down' -Shia screams 'OPTIMUS!!!!!'-Something happens in prolooooooonged slow motion. -BOOOOOOOBS! or anything attempting to be sexy. -You have no idea who is a good robot and who is naughty. -A common household object transforms in to a robot and we're supposed to be surprised. -You laugh. You're not drunk enough.Chug your drink when: -You see That Guy. Look for the wingsuit clip for your cue! That guy is finding his own ride home. -Megan Fox's disappearance is brushed off with a cheap line. -You get a mouth-gaping-open reaction shot. Don't confuse this with Rosie Huntington Whiteley's normal face. -You lose all respect for John Malkovich and Frances McDormand -Autobots win, Decepticons lose!I'll admit, I was suckered in to being a little bit entertained by the first hour or so of the movie. I did enjoy my first Shia outing with Disturbia – he plays a good spaz – but beyond that, I have not really enjoyed any of his acting. Maybe it was the 2 years I had to recover from the last movie, or perhaps the 5 Myer's and Cokes lubed my brain enough to enjoy the idiotic dialog and non-stop dialog. Where'd all the action go?The first half of the movie actually is decent storytelling. We get some historic background, some nice big shots of space and the crashed moon-ship, and some character development. It almost made me care about the world-wide destruction, but not quite. Once you get past the major plot points, it's really no different than any other of the movies – far too many characters, not enough creativity in the fight scenes (see: You have no idea who is a good robot and who is naughty), and too much Shia by that point.Word on the street be that this is the BEST EVARRR! of the Transformers movies. While it certainly felt like there was more of everything, it doesn't vary from any of the original plots or action sequences. New location, few new faces and gimmicks, but in the end it's just big robots fighting. If you liked the first two, BINGO! (or is that BEANO!), but if you hated them don't expect a sudden change of mind.It seems silly complaining about Transformers. After all, the entire thing was created to sell toys, comics, and video games to kids. However, if I'm going to a watch a 2 and-a-half hour commercial, I shouldn't have to pay $17.50 for some flimsy glasses and a mind-numbing CGI-fest.",Null,3,8,24 August 2011
