Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A landmark in a very rare genre.
","The ideas of blending animation and real life cinema is a rare concept, I can count the number of films I've seen in this style on one hand and it's safe to say none of them come close to matching the quality of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.Bob Hoskins plays Detective Valiant, he was a man once renowned for taking on cases to help toons. Until one night in toon town when a mysterious character killed his brother by dropping a piano on his head, after that moment he decided to never work for toons again. That is until cartoon film maker R.K. Maroon hires him for a dirty job; to snap some compromising pictures of Jessica Rabbit to prove to Roger Rabbit they shouldn't be together. It's a simple start to the story, but it soon evolves into a plot of twists and corruption.The film is a great blend of genres, principally it's a film noir meets animation. Detective Valiant is the archetypal detective embroiled in a case much deeper than he first thought, Jessica Rabbit is the seductive temptress (Hey, she isn't bad, she was just drawn that way), and of course there is a murder to solve. It's all there, and more. There is a blend of zany cartoon comedy and adult humour, much of it is derived from gags on the animated characters themselves, you know Betty Boop not doing too well since they started drawing in colour! The opening scene could force most adults to turn the movie off within seconds if you wasn't aware of what was to follow, but give it a few minutes and you're introduced to a unique version of seedy 1947 Hollywood. On a technical level it's impressive. For a movie made in 1988 the cartoons blend in well enough, they aren't perfect but they aren't bad. When Valiant actually enters Toon Town it's a bit rough around edges, but you can forgive this given the age it was made in. What the film really excels in is the interactions the characters have with the toons, a lot of praise has to go to the actors for this. I can imagine how difficult it must be to carry a conversation with thin air, but Bob Hoskins manages to react to Roger Rabbit convincingly throughout the whole film. Christopher Lloyds Judge Doom deserves a mention to, he is possibly one of the creepiest villains I've seen, and at the climax of the film when the little twist to his character is revealed he becomes a genuinely scary sight. For some reason, the films ambitious concept and merging of genres just seems to work. Its fun and tongue in cheek nature mixed with its darker side make for a unique experience. 7/10",8,1,1,7 January 2010
500 Days of Summer," A charming and unique romantic comedy.
","Ah, a rom-com, every guys worst nightmare? Not necessarily, I've much love for a good romance story but I confess most of my favourites are from some decades ago, but I'm an open minded guy who is willing to give the more recent romance films a go (as long as they've got a few good reviews first). From the start the scene is set, this isn't a typical Hollywood romance, there is no stuttering Hugh Grant slowly getting the girl of his dreams to fall for him, cue some catastrophe which makes it seem like they won't work but OH LOOK it's all OK in the end!! Nope. This is another one of those charming offbeat rom-coms that aren't afraid to be REAL. (Juno was undoubtedly last years gem). The opening monologue of the film declares this to be a 'Boy meets Girl' movie that isn't about love, however this simply isn't true. It's a story about love, loss and learning to move on.The movie revolves around Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who designs greeting cards for a living, he holds a degree in architecture but is yet to break free from the tethers of his meaningless job. Enter Summer ( Zooey Deschanel), new PA for Toms boss, and being so very beautiful and sweet it's only natural that Tom would fall in love with her at first sight. The films direction is what makes this tale so enthralling, the opening scene of the movie let's you know that it hasn't worked out; this match that is seemingly made in heaven just doesn't have the happy ending you will so desperately want to see. Instead the film swings like a pendulum throughout the time line of their relationship, one moment you will be in the early stages of their romance then you will be zipped forward in time to the depressing aftermath. So there you have the setting, what about the performances? Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fast becoming a favourite of mine, I recently read a quote from him about how he isn't in acting for the money, but rather the quality of the script, and well he may just be making the right choices for me to actually believe this. After picking two excellent scripts in Brick and Mysterious Skin he has made the right choice again, he brings a genuinely charming nature and confidence which makes him completely endearing to watch, but when the time calls he can bring a darker element to his acting . Zooey is sweet beyond words, one portion of the film brings a tongue in cheek testament to her beauty (I think the line was she is responsible for an average of 18.4 double takes a day from men), her natural girl next door looks combined with her dismissive views on love makes her the unattainable girl you feel you must makes yours. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, even in the most fleeting of conversations they have you feel the spark between them.The screenplay here is killer to, Marc Webb is handed a script that gives him much creative license. The breakaway scenes offer a bit of random comic relief, but my favourite is the morning after Toms sexual conquest when he walks down the street and bursts into a random song and dance number; the high fives, rocketing fountains and 'batting it out of the park' had me in complete stitches. Props have to be given to the soundtrack to, you have The Smiths, Doves, Regina Spektor and a few more I've probably missed, but they all fit the tone of the film so damn well.Anyways, suffice to say I really enjoyed this. It's the type of film I think we need more of to break the monotony of the generic rom-com.8/10",8,1,3,3 January 2010
The Hurt Locker," A suspenseful movie about the addiction to war.
","Hurt Locker opens with the quote 'The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.' This sentence is the very essence of what this film is about. Expert bomb disposal unit Bravo Company a month and a half left in their rotation in Iraq, a job of almost unimaginable danger. The unit must enter the very heart of war-torn cities and risk their lives to disable bombs placed by insurgents. It almost beggars belief that people really have this job, I'll steal directly from the film itself here but it can be perfectly summed up as 'every day is a roll of dice with death'. Who knows when the bomb will blow, a sniper could be lurking in any one of the decrepit buildings. How can anyone last more than a day in this job? SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is the man responsible for walking up to the bomb itself and disarming it. He is wreckless and hopelessly addicted to adrenaline rush his job provides, seemingly going out of his way to make situations more dangerous than they need to be. It's a top performance from Renner, he doesn't have to deliver any challenging dialogue, it's more a case of the audience needing to believe the character they are seeing. A guy addicted to blowing up bombs? Yeah right. But Renners portrayal makes you believe there are people like him in the real world. Sgt. JT Sanborn and Spc. Own Eldrige are the two other members of Bravo Company. They provide the cover, identifying dangers other than the bomb and advising James on what to do (not that he ever listens during the film). Their characters are more grounded in a reality we can comprehend, especially Eldrige who seems to be the one who completely recognises the danger of his job. He is the opposite to James, fearful of every mission and counting down the days till he can leave.The film is shot wonderfully, giving the subject matter you know what to expect. It's gritty, raw and almost unbearably tense at times. The first bomb we see Bravo Company tackle sets the tone, every person in view could be the man who put it there, it could detonate at any moment, and the suspense crescendos until it literally explodes. There is also a superb sniper encounter halfway through the film which is probably my favourite of the movie, it's a simple set up of two guys facing each other and firing in single shots separated by an almost insurmountable amount of time, you see the smoke as the gun fires and then the half a second wait before knowing if the bullet has missed you or killed you.I'll stop running through the scenes now, because almost all of them are great. I'll just say I'm very happy I watched this film, when it comes to war movies the bar is set very high but somehow they rarely disappoint. Maybe it's the subject matter, being such a serious concept it makes sense that it shouldn't be taken on unless it can be done right. 7.5/10",7,4,9,7 January 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Viewpoint of the Holocaust through a young child eyes.
","The boy in striped pyjamas explores the holocaust through the eyes of an 8 year old boy called Bruno. He lives with his Mother Elsa, his SS commandant Father and Sister Gretal in a wealthy estate, but when his Father is assigned to a prison camp they must reallocate from their luxurious lifestyle to a grim looking residence only a couple of miles from the concentration camp itself. As soon as this post is confirmed a leaving party is held for the Father, and we see that not everyone is a Nazi supporter as the Grandmother of Bruno openly criticises the Father.As the film progresses Brunos naivety towards the Jewish people and what is happening to them lead him to discover the prison and meet a young Jew called Schmuel. Although they are separated by an electric fence and lifestyles which couldn't be further apart a friendship blossoms. Bruno is envious of Schmuel, separated from his friends back home he sees the prison camp as some sort of playground and longs to join him inside.Back in the new residence divides start to form in the household. The homeschooling bores Bruno, he does not understand the Nazi propaganda and instead prefers to read fictional books, his sister however, buys into it and is soon redecorating her room with Swastikas and other Nazi paraphernalia. When an off the cuff comment from one of the Fathers soldiers reveals to Elsa that the Jewish people are being burned in the concentration camp she is dismayed at what her husband is doing which leads to an angry and tearful confrontation.It's strange to think that in Nazi Germany some people could be ignorant as to what is going on, coupled with the chastising remarks from the Grandmother the film loosely explores the divide that existed at the time. The choice to have British accents as opposed to German is an interesting one, German accents can be sharp and harsh, but the British voices hit home that the people involved in Nazi Germany were just as human as anyone else, which makes the atrocities committed all the more horrifying. The burning of Jews is reduced to performances charts, efficiency diagrams and promotions, whilst others cannot comprehend that their families could do such things. The performances from the two children stand out from the rest. Asa Butterfield as Bruno remains convincingly wide eyed and curious throughout the film, Jack Scanlon as Schmuel presents a depressed figure, a child who does and doesn't understand what is happening to him, and a friendship realistically develops through the kind of connection that is born from the innocence of youth. The end scene of the film is predictable but it doesn't detract from the horror of it. However I did feel slightly perturbed, although to have such a dark ending is commendable I did get the feeling that the concentration camp wasn't sad enough so it needed a German child to die in it to just to hit home how terrible it was. The slightly contrived nature of it did ruin the emotional effect it should have had on me.Despite my grievances with the ending, it's a solid film that does the subject matter justice. The lingering afterthought of what the Jewish people went through whilst people in Nazi Germany either treated it as work or resented the ones that were doing it is food for thought. 7/10",6,0,1,12 February 2010
Avatar," Epic Sci-Fi blending romance and action.
","Unless you've been living under a rock in a cave you've seen an Avatar advert, promising to blow you away with unrivalled 3D and some of the most realistic CGI ever put onto screen. I've always been sceptical about 3D cinema, for me 2D cinema is perfect. Everything that a film needs to be great can be captured in 2D, hell, everything a new film needs to be great can be captured in black and white but that still doesn't stop these new colouring techniques revamping old films. So here we have a relatively new breed of cinema experience, one that I experienced for the first time today in all its glory at the IMAX.The story is a basic one; Humans play the role of the invading Aliens, so this time it is us who have the technology and the edge. Their interest in the world of Pandora is due to the rich mineral known as 'unobtanium' (as silly as it sounds, it is actually a real name), which is inconveniently located in the depths of the planet underneath the Hometree of the Na'Vi, 10 foot tall humanoid powerhouses who survive the world through a deep understanding of nature and life.The Avatar project is the means of finding a diplomatic solution, Na'Vi bodies are grown in labs with human DNA, and then remotely controlled and dropped onto the planet to learn about the natives, hopefully leading to a peaceful resolution. When Jake Sullys Phd holding brother dies, the military request that Jake (a marine with no training in the Avatar programme) takes his brothers place in the project. Turns out these things are pretty damn expensive to make and having similar DNA means he is the only other person who can control this Avatar, which appears a good alternative to his paraplegic human one.As he takes on the role of the Na'Vi, he learns there ways and their trust, and so the story unfolds into one of love, betrayal and war. The films main weakness is it's predictability, at no point does it challenge you to guess what is going to happen because it can all be seen from a mile away. You know who he is going to fall in love with, you know that when hope appears to be lost the saviour will come, and the final act offers the payoff you would expect from 2 hours worth of build up, an epic battle between human and aliens. Despite that it did suck me in, one scene with Jake capturing the Turok and returning to the tribe should of been cheesy, but I was completely and utterly invested in the film so it managed to have an emotional impact on me. And I know this was largely due to its presentation.The rendering of Pandora is a beauty to behold, the floating mountains, the Hometree, it's almost indistinguishable from real life, and the Na'Vi themselves look authentic and move with slick realism. The use of 3D isn't abused at any point, it complements the film without being the sole reason the film was made. Nothing jumps out at the screen in a 'Look at the big bad 3D! It's going to get you!', it's a lot more subtle. One scene with small floating 'spirits' from a tree landing on Jake was a favourite of mine, it's almost tempting to reach your hand out and try to pluck one. Don't get me wrong though, when the battles start the 3D is intense, but the fact it was applied in so many different ways is what made it work. James Horner provides a very impressive soundtrack to, the tribal feel combined with wordless vocals captured the mood of the planet perfectly.Even if the ingredients of the story are taken from the Hollywood cookbook, it was one of the most visually immersive films I have seen. It might not be the most intelligent or creative plot, but at this moment in time James Cameron is one of the few directors in the world who can be handled a budget of such magnitude and deliver. 8/10",7,0,1,21 January 2010
Inception," An energetic and complex sci-thriller that redefines the saying 'How deep does the rabbit hole go?'
","Inception Nolans latest effort is a cleverly constructed and beautifully executed sci-fi thriller, apparently he first pitched the idea to WB in 2003 and then went away to write a script he thought would be finished in a few months, 8 years later the film is released and it's no wonder it took so long to complete. The film follows Cobb (Leonadro Di Caprio), who specialises in entering people's dreams and stealing valuable secrets his employers. We open with Cobb in the mind of Saito(Ken Watanabe); a business tycoon he needs to retrieve secret documents from, but things go horribly wrong when the subconscious projection of his former wife enters the dream and betrays him. Cobb and his partner Arthur (Joseph-Gordon Levitt) are forced to flee the country as their employers will not tolerate failure, but Saito tracks them down and makes them an offer; Inception. If they can successfully plant an idea into the mind of one of Saitos competitors Saito will pull the strings necessary to grant Cobb the freedom to go back to America and see his kids again. Cobbs team is consists of Arthur, Yusuf the chemist (Dileep Rao), Eames (Tom Hardy), Adriadne the architect (Ellen Page) who is responsible for creating the dream. Nolan not only manages to create a wonderful story, but also adds his own cyberpunk dialogue to the mix. 'Riding the kick', 'Totems', 'Projections', they all add substance to the world he has created. The origins of this technology are not explored, in fact it's more of an alternate reality than a story set in the future, but it's a world constructed with such attention to detail that it feels real. What follows is a complex but not overly contrived series of dreams within dreams in order to plant the idea deep enough for it to stick. It's a mixture of theft and business espionage that provides a setting for some wonderful visuals, and in the end the only limitation is the mind of Nolan himself. One scene where Arthur is fighting off the projections of the target inside a rotating corridor is thrilling to watch in all its nauseating vertigo, whilst Cobbs training of Adriadne provide the artistic license to pull a whole host of crazy special effects. Cities bend in half, mirrors smash and turn into streets, it's a world of unlimited potential. Di Caprio once again proves that he knows how to pick a movie, his Scorsese partnership rarely disappoints, but Nolan has provided the platform for another successful performance. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is able to play his role with both suave coolness and perfectly timed comedic relief, whilst Ellen Page uses her indie image to convey a female lead devoid of the usual stereotypes. The rest of the supporting cast all do a fine job, especially Cillian Murphy as the mind-invaded and emotionally manipulated target of the Inception.After watching this film I'm still convinced Nolan boasts a flawless oeuvre, every one demonstrates a clear talent for script-writing. Insomnia may be the weakest of them all and it will come as no surprise it's the only film he had no hand in writing in. Nolan however could not resist one final teaser to the audience with Inception. As the film concludes and we are left satisfied with the arc of our protagonist, the camera pans away on to the perpetually spinning totem. As it is about to topple the film cuts away, now I don't think Nolan is seriously trying to imply that Cobb is dreaming, instead I think it's his own clever Inception. To plant an idea into the minds of the audience and watch it grow.",8,4,7,18 July 2010
Up in the Air," A comedic look at certain philosophies of life
","Up in the Air is the latest effort from Jason Reitman, it's a simple story following the seemingly empty everyday life of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), providing insight into choices of life style and the importance of human connection.Ryan Bingham with a strange job; when a business has to lose a few employees they contact the company Ryan works for, who in turn send people out to do it for them. Ryan's life is a series of flights and airports as he travels America to fire people (sorry, I mean 'let them go'). It's no surprise that such a nomadic lifestyle has led Ryan to become a man with no connections to people, where most people would aim to build a family and own a home, Ryans greatest ambition is to clock up 10 million air miles for classy airport pass and his name on the side of a plane. The first real encounter we see him have is with Alex (Vera Farmiga), but their chemistry isn't built around the usual romantic notions we see in cinema, instead it is very businesses like. Two people who have similar tastes and desires and accept their situations dictate that the relationship can never be anything more. One great scene with the two of them whipping out their laptops to arrange their next sexual encounter based around their flight schedule sums it up perfectly.Ryans life takes a turn when new employee Natalie Keener (Anna Hendrick) proposes an idea to the boss of Ryans company to change their approach. Instead of flying around America the company will do the firing via webcam and a laptop. The drastic effect this will have on the lifestyle of Ryan leaves him very opposed to the idea, with matters made more awkward when he is told to take Natalie around America to show her the ropes when it comes to delivering the news. As Ryan travels with Natalie, she challenges his philosophies and forces him to take a close look at the life he has chosen, with the prospect of being grounded and his growing affection for Alex he soon finds himself toying with the idea of changing his approach to the world.The supporting cast do their jobs well, but George Clooney takes the centre stage, he is his usual suave self here, oozing confidence and coolness. Being one of the few single men his age in Hollywood and with only one distant marriage to his name, maybe he is bringing a bit of himself to the film with his anti-commitment philosophies. He also brings a nice subtle brand of comedy, he can deliver lines with deadpan or sarcasm with such little effort that will still make you laugh out loud.The script is clever and witty but also insightful. The first half has a lighter whimsical feel to it, as we are getting to know Ryans character we are treated to some great throwaway lines and funny interactions (mostly with what appear to be semi-improvised snippets of people being fired), one of my favourite gags was the observations on different people in airport ques. As the film progresses the change in tone shifts a little. The humour is still there but the script focuses more on the seriousness of Ryans situation, to be a man without a home or a family, how can someone live without the prospect of building these things? Is it even feasible? The soundtrack provides a nice mix of folk and soft rock, which is a suitable choice for the films slow meandering pace.The subject of living a life without roots versus building a family and a home is something we have all thought about before, and after watching it I was left considering Ryans views on life, and having that lingering thought process after a film always mean you've watched something worth seeing. It's slightly let down by the pacing towards the end, but the tight script and the comedic take on philosophies on life make for a strong effort that is most definitely worth watching.7/10",7,0,2,24 January 2010
