The Blair Witch Project," Doesn't Get You Till You're Alone...
","Right off, I didn't think much of the movie.  Wasn't scared, but it seriously creeped me out.  Later, however, I heard a weird sound in my house and the first thing that popped into my head, 'Blair Witch!'  The movie's been in the back of my mind since I saw it.  It's...disturbing!  True terror.",10,1,2,13 August 1999
