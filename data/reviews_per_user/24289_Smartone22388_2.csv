Minority Report," Good yet too long and confusing!
","This movie was not bad but it was WAY too long and confusing. 
*SPOILERS*Well this isn't but...there are too many names and faces to remember in this movie.  Whenever they show the holographic home movies you don't know whether it's a transmission or if it's the past.  No one ever expected I am sure that the old guy was the person who set up John Anderton (Cruise). That was nothing I expected at all.  I don't have anymore comments.",6,0,0,22 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," AOTC is best Star Wars yet!!!!!
","When I was anticipating Episode II to come out I really didn't know what to expect after the disappointment with The Phantom Menace.  As a true Star Wars fan, I loved it and since it came out I have seen it four times! George Lucas did well in the love sequence department which was a new area for him.  Palpatine is extremely two-faced and it is very visible how he turns to the Emperor from the Supreme Chancellor.  (In case you didn't know...Darth Sidious and Supreme Chancellor Palpatine are the exact same person.)  You can see how Anakin's anger leads him to be seduced by the dark side.  Palpatine is already seducing Anakin to the dark side by telling him he is the greatest of all Jedi.  Jar Jar Binks had limited screen time which is EXCELLENT!  Yoda...jeez what is there to say about Yoda...we'll just say this...Yoda is bada**!!!!!  I voted this a ten and this is my new favorite movie!  Go see Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,0,7 June 2002
