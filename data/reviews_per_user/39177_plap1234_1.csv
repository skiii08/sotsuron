Lucky Number Slevin," A sub par Snatch\ Lock Stock rip off
","Following the recommendation of a friend of mine I wound up watching this 'brilliant' crime drama. Having barely resisted the temptation to walk out, I felt like warning others to stay away from this ordeal. As suspected this is yet another movie with plenty of violence, complicated plot twists and a barrage of dull characters from the seedy criminal underworld of New York city. But what worked rather well in the Guy Ritchie films completely backfires in this film, making it the biggest flop I have seen in quite a while. The attempt to capture the sharp and cool dialog of said films is pitiful, and listening to it resembles being whacked in the head by a blunt object. The film is edited in an apparent pretext to increase suspense by hiding critical information from the viewer, this was done however in a terribly annoying manner. By the second half of the movie the plot twists cause one to loose all remaining sympathy for the characters, and replaces it with pure disdain. I can not help but wonder how great actors like Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman got mixed up in this embarrassment. My guess is currency had something to do with it. In short save your money for a more enjoyable activity, like going to the dentist.",2,8,22,12 June 2006
