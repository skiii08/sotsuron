The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," HALF MOVIE ---> a pride for the 'industry'...but a shame for entertainment.
","This film gets the primary goal for its creation: to MAKE MONEY.They had to use 2 parts in order to sell lot of tickets, twice if possible, and to do that they dedicated to extend EVERY POSSIBLE SCENE to a lenght and tedious dimension I thought I would never seen in this movie series.From the moment I saw the trailer, I started to suspect, but with the benefit of the doubt, went to the theater and man, what a disappointment.It does not deserves a 0/10, lets make this clear, because the acting is not bad. But it does not deserves, in my opinion, more than a 4/10, since we have been given HALF MOVIE.I feel robbed, and I feeli should be allowed to see the second part FOR FREE.",4,20,27,9 December 2014
