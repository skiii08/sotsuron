Minority Report," Sorry, I wasn't impressed
","I rented this DVD in part because of the previously posted, highly favorable review, but was far less impressed. The special effects are undoubtedly stunning. Samantha Morton as Agatha is a real find; I expect to see much more of her in the future. However, anyone who was awed by Max von Sydow in 'Judgment at Nuremberg' will be dismayed at the depths to which he has sunk, because this is, simply put, just another cautionary tale about the evils of technology. And really, do we need another movie based on a tired premise, especially one that serves primarily as a vehicle for Tom Cruise?",7,0,0,26 April 2003
The Others," The Thinking Person's scary movie
","This was the scariest movie I have ever seen. Kidman--not a favorite of mine--was brilliant, and Fionnula Flanagan was perfect as Mrs. Mills. The tension between them was palpable. Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar deserves tremendous credit for a stunning movie, included getting the details right, from both medical and historical perspectives.",10,0,0,4 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Disappointing for all but a few...(possible spoilers)
","Yes, the movie was fast paced; yes, it held my attention; yes, it was more mature than the first two. That said, it was sadly disappointing.I've read all the books and saw the first two movies. I went to this movie with two children who saw the first two movies, and their parents, one of whom knew nothing about the books or the movies. No one but I understood the movie. No one could follow it, beyond the surface story.Too much essential detail was left out, evidenced by the questions I heard afterwards: What are the dementors doing when they do that sucking thing? Why did they keep going after Harry and not the other students? Why didn't Harry get in trouble for zapping Snape? Why did Sirius Black break out now? How did they know which animal was involved? What happened to Trelawney? Why didn't McGonigle know what was going on? More important, why didn't Snape know what was going on?? On a different level, why not a bit more attention to making Dumbledore look more similar to Richard Harris? A little more hair, a little more beard would have done wonders. No, that might not matter to adults, but it matters to children!I can only hope that a Director's Cut exists, and that IT will be what's on the DVD when it's released.",8,0,0,6 June 2004
The Queen," Wow, what a disappointment.
","Oh, my...where to start? Beautiful scenery and good use of actual footage. But, honestly, I watched the entire thing twice, including extras, and kept waiting for the award-wining movie. Helen Mirren playing an emotionally inhibited, superior British woman. Same tired blah, blah, blah about the royals not liking Diana and vice versa. Same message about the royals being out of touch with contemporary sensibilities (no! really?). Same guesswork about what the daily life of the family looks like. I suppose royalty fans will like it.Now, what might be meaningful is if, 50-ish years from now, the royals are gone and someone, some day, wonders why they were eased out. This movie would give them a clue. There were no sympathetic portrayals here.",5,2,6,1 May 2007
Gangs of New York," Daniel Day-Lewis makes it work
","A good--not great--movie. The premise is interesting and historically it's as accurate as one can expect. Cameron Diaz is razor sharp as Jennie, and DiCaprio is adequate. However, Daniel Day-Lewis, as William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting, is absolutely stunning. He makes a tilted head or a perfectly timed gaze say more than any other cast member. DiCaprio will get star credit, but without Day-Lewis 'Gangs' is just another period piece.",8,0,0,4 January 2003
