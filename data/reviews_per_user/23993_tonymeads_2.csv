Airlift," Hate subtitles......but
","This was an excellent movie and i really don't care to read subtitles but this movie just kept my attention and before i knew it the movie was over,This is a very timely movie right now, as my country a beacon of freedom and hope for refugees has been forced to turn her back on refugees facing much worse than these folks caught in Kuwait,because of a scared and hateful segment of our population who voted for a disgusting man{CHEETO}.Recommend the haters who are blocking refugees to our country watch this movie and maybe it will soften their hearts.",10,1,2,10 February 2017
