Hereditary," An intelligent, well crafted story. Brilliant.
","I know there are good horror movies still being produced, but you have to work to find them. In this instance, the horror fell right into my lap. Excellent film. And smart. If you do not enjoy this movie, turn off your phone and watch it again - you weren't paying attention.",9,1,3,13 January 2019
Knives Out," A fun movie but over rated
","I was expecting to be blown away with some bananas twists and turns. The writing is fun but not mindblowing. I thought Daniel Craig's character could've used more of an introduction to start the film. I found his role a bit distracting until I got used to it. I also felt too locked up in the setting until finally getting a reprieve with a new scene/setting. I would've started the movie with Craig at another location.Go and see it though, it's fun.",8,1,2,7 January 2020
