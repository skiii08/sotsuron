Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not So Great Expectations
","Even though my expectations were low, oh how disappointing I found this movie. I suppose fame went to George's head, he felt that he was flawless, and he couldn't 'cash the check'.The most difficult is the fact that this movie had the chance to be pretty good. It moved along at an incredibly fast and exciting pace right from the start. I had goosebumps for the first 20 minutes. Unfortunately there were some real bombs throughout.I don't mind Jar-Jar so much. What makes me squirm are things like the whiney Jedi council (especially Yoda) who demonstrates nothing impressive especially when testing Anakin with that dumb little etch-a-scetch. The Jedi council should have been one of the best scenes in the movie! And some of the action sequences were so poorly directed they were reminiscent of the A-Team. (However, Darth Maul was so good he made the Jedis look like the high school colorguard.)Lucas was great in his day with American Graffiti, THX, and Star Wars and it suggests that maybe a younger director breath life into this story. But then I remember Irvin Kershner who had no trouble directing an excellent Empire Strikes Back at age 57!I would love it if Irvin came out and directed some of the new episodes...sorry George. You were truly great once! I don't care what people say about the bad dialog and bad acting in Star Wars. That movie was beautiful! Please get back to your roots and keep in simple. You're losing your vision. Remember don't worry about anybody else, just do your own thing and people will love you.",6,0,1,3 September 2001
American History X," Trite and Moronic Sensationalism
","Reminiscent of Spike Lee's Malcolm X who's main character had a change of heart and mind in prison that was followed by an epiphany when he saw men and woman of all races alike searching for answers, American History X unfortunately fails to demonstrate the most important element of any cathartic journey: Soul Searching.This is an obvious fiction of a boy who filled the vacuum of his missing father with a figure who would do his father's murder justice. The idea is interesting. However, it attempted to gather sympathy (and successfully) for the boy's plight by taking pot shots at easy targets. Derek is portrayed early in the movie preaching a succinct set of more than half-baked ideals which magically disintegrated with his 'change of heart' in prison; when all his better angels kindly removed his indignation. The most insulting nugget of sanctimoniousness is Sweeny's comment 'Ask yourself one question...has this made your life better?'. Folks, when fighting for ANY cause, no-one ever expects the quality of one's life to improve. Did Ghandi's life improve by fasting?!Frankly, this is a very tough and serious subject that deserves more than a `change of heart'; it also demands a change of mind. It demands a journey of thought and reason. But in Hollywood who needs reason when you have tears, right? Thus we're left with a serious theme that is trampled by trite and exaggerated sensationalism.I believed at first that the sanctimoniousness was Tony Kaye's. But perhaps this touch is Edward Norton's who apparently monkey-ed around in post-production to the point where Tony Kaye wanted to use a pseudonym (I don't blame him). This wouldn't surprise me after seeing Norton's naive tear-jerker Keeping the Faith. Unfortunately, in Norton I'm 'Losing the Faith'.This movie could've been much better if it was created for grown ups. But then it would have to have been created by grown ups.",2,8,21,13 October 2002
Before Sunrise," Once Again Linklater Avoids Mediocrity!
","As in his other movies, Linklater has a terrific earthy reality to his movies which makes me feel like one of the characters. He always hits on my own personal issues so accurately that I feel like he's reading my mind. I always thought of such issues as mine alone, so I find his movies to be a cure for my own feelings of aloneness as well as for anyone of my generation (born in the 60s).I appreciate his sticking to his vision in this film. Bravo!",8,1,3,5 October 2000
