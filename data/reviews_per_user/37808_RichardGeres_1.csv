The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Part I
","I found several scenes worthwhile after all. The problem with TWILIGHT is the basic premise: Girl is torn between a vampire and a werewolf. Filmmakers have trod this familiar path before, most popularly with the Kate Beckinsale-starred, UNDERWORLD, as well as on cable TV's THE VAMPIRE DIARIES. And a cornucopia of wannabe authors have cropped up after Stephenie Meyer's meteoric rise and TWILIGHT's phenomenal success. In the hands of Catherine Hardwicke, the first two films delved deep into Bella Swann's musings and quandaries, while bombarding us with innumerable scenes straight out of a Vogue pictorial with beauteous vampires dressed to the nines and pouting angstily. This third film (broken into two parts, bringing in more dollars for the people involved) is handily directed by Bill Condon, who gave us the wonderfully crafted GODS AND MONSTERS.",Null,1,6,20 November 2011
