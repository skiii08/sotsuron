The Ring," Does It Have a Happy or Sad Ending?
","I watched the movie half way through and any movie that kills a teenager at the beginning, (Slightly better than killing a kid) is probably not going to be mainstream stuff. About a half an hour in to it I went to IMDb to see if I could figure out if it was going to have a happy or sad ending. I read about 30 comments and could not figure it out. It was compared to the Blair Witch Project a couple times and so I decided to stop watching as I was afraid it was going to having a sad disappointing ending to it like the Blair Witch did.There should be some sort of rating system that let viewers know ahead of time if good or evil is going to win out.",5,0,1,28 May 2009
Se7en," I don't know how it ends
","Once an actor has been in a movie with an evil counterculture end and as the bad guy I don't trust movies that actor is in anymore. Kevin Spacey is one such actor. I was half watching Se7en for a long time while I was doing some work on the computer, thinking I wish I knew the remote control was. Near the end I realized that Kevin Spacey was John Doe but he was in jail so I let it go on a little longer. When I heard Morgan Freeman say that John Doe had the upper hand I had to get up fast and change the channel. I still don't know how it ends.There really should be a rating system that a movie has a bad ending so that guys like me don;t get suckered into watching crap like this.",2,5,12,20 May 2011
Casino Royale," Save James Bond
","In some respects this was a James Bond movie, but it's not fun anymore. The movie is overly violent and has a tragic end that could of easily been avoided. James Bond saves the world but who is going to save James Bond from the meanies producing his movies. The James Bond they have is no Pierce Bronson and is better suited to being a bad guy I think. The chase scenes at the beginning is good but too long. Bring back the bouncy girl credits. Now we know what a double o means. Ian Fleming's favorite movie was the original Casino Royale which I much prefer to this version. This reminds me of what they did with Superman when they reinvented him in the early 90's. They killed him off and brought him back from the dead stronger than ever. Then they killed two kids in the comic book and I stopped reading it. The people producing James Bond movies better be careful that they don t lose the popular culture ties they have by putting bad endings on his movies, if it s not too late already.",Null,13,22,22 December 2006
