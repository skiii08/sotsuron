Requiem for a Dream," Bleak. Depressing. Horrible. Dark. Brilliant.
","I watched this movie on recommendation not to, I was told that it was a horrible film that lacked any sort of happiness throughout, i took the advice and watched it 15 minutes later. On finishing i sat in my seat for a half hour and then decided to watch the lion king because i knew it ended well and i knew that it would remind me that life is okay and not as terrible as it is portrayed in Requiem For A Dream. Its all the adjectives i listed above and more, frankly I've run out words that are similar to 'bleak', this movie makes you want to kill yourself. it has a gentle, nice start, followed by sheer darkness. its indescribably gut wrenching. i implore you to watch it, for without actually sitting through and suffering through this horror then you simply cant understand.It makes you lose all faith in life, in humanity and in movies. But it is, without a doubt, one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. as a viewer we want something that sticks out, something that amazes us. from jared leto's exceptional performance to the incredible storyline as this piece of genius represents the destruction drugs can bring to someone from any walk of life, this movie without a doubt amazes. i will never forget the day that i watched the godfather, the matrix, the batman trio, the lord of the rings trio, the shawshank redemption, and i can promise i will never forget the day that i sat down to watch requiem for a dream.watch it without question, but have something Disney on standby, maybe a teddy bear as well, and some ice cream.",9,1,2,23 June 2013
Iron Man 3," Just plain poor
","I find movies to be constantly going downhill, iron man's trilogy has gone from bad to awful. Robert Downey Jr's awful portrayal of iron man through his arrogant, simply irritating nature and the lack of chemistry he and Gwyneth paltrow have together all blend together to make one very mind blowingly average film. its boring, its cheesy and its predictable. its just plain poor. is it really too much to ask for a marvel film that in some way challenges the superhero series of batman? because at this point its out of hand, maybe the bar has just been set to such a high standard by the batman series that anything else just fails to match up, but they could at least make an effort. very much struggling to find anything positive to say about this movie, in some of these types of movies you could at least push for some good action scenes to somewhat disguise a horrible storyline and an even worse script but it lacked even that basic need for a good superhero film. don't start to watch it, you could spend 130 mins doing about 130,000 better things.",4,3,6,23 June 2013
