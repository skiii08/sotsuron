Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 4 stars for the hype
","While watchable, it lacks the character development and pacing of the previous(later?) episodes.  The acting is wooden, the aliens are too over-the-top to fit Lucas' alleged serial homage vision, and many of the special effects are intrusive.  Most of the movies' appeal is its' place in the Star Wars saga, and I'm just too anal to not see it.",Null,0,1,4 August 1999
