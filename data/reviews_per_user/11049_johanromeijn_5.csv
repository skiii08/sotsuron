Scarface," The #1 Mobster movie
","In Scarface Al Pacino does one of his best acting performances ever. His career in the mobster world may not be found very realistically, however it shows that when you really want something, you can achieve it when going for it 100%.His affection for his sister and his Cuban friend are typical ingredients for mobster movies. However taking a Cuban instead of an Italian for a mobster movie is quite original.Tony's past in Cuba is a guideline for all of his behavior in the rest of the movie, which realistically explains to us how criminals are made.The movie is great to watch and I can guarantee that when you like mobster movies in general, you'll be on the edge of your seat from the start of the movie till the end.*Author's note: My native language is Dutch, so please excuse me for grammatical errors.

The 13th Warrior," Good effects, nice idea, but that plot.....
","Where do I start...... Well, the atmosphere in this movie was good, so was the setting. I liked the 'Arab' between the 'Normen'. So far for the positive parts, now for the negative.The story was unconvincing and impossible. The movie starts out weak, gets better, but the last half hour was an anticlimax. The movie's climax was somewhere when the cannibals storm the village for the first time, what was if I recall it well, around the 40th minute of the movie. BAD!!!!!! Very bad indeed!!I will now sum up the things that are impossible or leave a questionmark in my head.How can an Arab possibly meet Normen in the desert? The larger part of the movie is set in Scandinavia. How come there are africans among the cannibals? How come that not all cannibals are african, but some also have the Scandinavian look? Why is the leading part for Antonio Banderas and is the heroic part in the final scene for a minor character? Why is the romance between Antonio and this girl worked out so poor? Why are there so many small scenes in the movie, where they never get back to?I am sure I still forgot some questions, but at this very moment I can't recall them.To conclude I want to state that after when I saw the movie, my first impression was: 'Cool!'Than I went to the bathroom and started thinking...When I came back and thought over about how to comment for IMDB, my conclusion was that this movie was actually very poor, and only to be recommended to real lovers of the medieval genre.Regards, Johan Romeijn",7,0,0,22 June 2000
The Usual Suspects," A+ Masterpiece
","Wow! What a thrill! Whoever wrote the plot deserves an A+!!!!Seldom I've seen a story SO exciting and an outcome SO unexpected. When you think the Scream series got cool twists at the end, you HAVE to see this one because it will show you Scream's amateurism. 10 out of 10. I want to tell so much more about scenes I liked but than I'd ruin the fun for the people who are planning to go and see this movie. I can recommend it to anyone.Go and see it!!!!!!!!!",10,0,1,7 July 2000
Any Given Sunday," BASH BOOM BLANG!
","This movie is the BEST football movie I've ever seen. The atmosphere, the noise, the soundtrack. Everything fits in the typical attitude that football breathes.Any Given Sunday takes you away in the life of a complete football club. From managers to players.The only weak point to this movie is, in my opinion, Cameron Diaz's weak acting performance. However the outstanding acting by Al Pacino makes up for it all the way.Groningen Giants 4 Ever!!",8,0,0,20 June 2000
Trainspotting," Drugs are bad......MMMkay??????
","I don't know why I waited THIS long till watching Trainspotting. I saw the movie tonight without subtitling. For me the accents were real hard, but you could guess what was said. Humorous, dark, morals, this movie has it all.
If you ever thought about taking heavier drugs, like myself, this movie lets you drop that idea RIGHT away. Best example was probably Tommy. A dude with no job, but hey: He had a girlfriend, had his mind straight, didn't do drugs and than....His girlfriend dropped him. When Mark visited his house later on in the movie you could hardly recognize it from before......For me the only unsatisfying part was the sideline of Mark's relationship with underaged Diane.However, I will add this movie to my All Time Favourites, where it is in the company of movies like Reservoir Dogs and Ravenous.Mentioning Ravenous, Robert Carlyle was EXCELLENT! Once more....I guess evil roles fit him!Choose Trainspotting. You missed something when you haven't seen it. A Masterpiece, 9/10",9,0,1,27 June 2000
