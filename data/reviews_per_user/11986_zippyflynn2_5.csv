Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The trailer is better
","What a disappointment, especially after seeing the reviews 'funniest movie ever!' 'I couldn't stop laughing!' I'll admit, I thought the trailers were pretty funny but that was it, those were the best jokes. The movie just takes a couple of other much lower brow jokes and beats them to death and they, sadly, weren't as funny as the jokes I had already seen. Frankly, they weren't funny at all. I stopped laughing at poop jokes and sophomoric homophobia jokes when I stopped being a kid. I've seen other Borat skits and thought they were worth a laugh but, like the trailer, they were far better than this film. I got to admit, they did a good job of promoting this movie and even led skeptical me to think the film was going to better than the promise. I really didn't expect Cohen to dive straight into the toilet to find his material. Literally! I also was anticipating more development with the ethnic jokes, as some reviewers had claimed but he never gets out of first gear with them so they remain simple, two dimensional stereotypical embarrassments, far more effective as fuel for the prejudiced and the racist than as satirical commentary. That was a major disappointment. I know Mr. Cohen is Jewish, so it seems he is making fun of anti-Semitism but, unfortunately his material is poorly developed, clichéd and amateurish, so it won't give him the desired results, that is, if he wanted the 'jokes' to have more effect than belly laughs for the primitive brain. At one point he states his manager does not want to fly in America because he does not want the Jews to do the same thing they did on 9/11. It might actually have been funny if, sadly, there weren't such a great number of dim witted, hate filled people, including many Americans, who actually believe this to be the case. Anti-Semitism is on the rise everywhere, just look at a lot of the messages on these message boards to confirm that. As Woody Allen stated when asked about the Holocaust 'Records were made to be broken.' Of course, the Holocaust never really happened, just ask the 'experts' like Mel Gibson's dad. I never cease to be amazed at the hatred and scapegoating that comes about, usually as the result of bad, moronic fiction. Mr. Cohen's bad, moronic jokes won't assist him, despite his ethnicity. As any intelligent and honest student of history can tell you, the Nazis became very effective at turning innocuous little Jewish jokes and ordinary proverbs into raging, racist tirades used as fuel to run the death camps and the trains that took their cargo there. I really hope Mr. Cohen likes the money he'll make from this film, because that's all he'll end up getting from it. He failed to accomplish anything else with this venture, other than offending the people of Kazakhstan. That was completely unnecessary: he should have made up a fictitious country for his character to come from, then all the jokes about the backwardness would be funny because they don't belittle others with stereotypical crude jokes, particularly a place the vast majority of outsiders did not know existed prior to this movie. A lesson in comedy for Mr. Cohen: your jokes that take the stuffing out of the arrogant well-known (i.e. the rodeo segment) work because, well, they take the stuffing out of some arrogant well-known. Making some unknown little country the butt of your jokes is cruel and the tactic of a bully, which loses its comedic effect when the viewer realizes they will be nothing more than crude stereotypes, unless the viewer, (like too many, unfortunately) likes the cruel 'humor' of the bully. I think you have potential to really be funny Mr. Cohen, but you lost me when you degenerated into sophomoric gags whether due to your laziness, desire to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and/or your lack of ability to develop and deliver smart, thoughtful material.",3,8,16,10 November 2006
The Hustler," One of the all-time great American films
","The Hustler is one of those rare films that has been so well crafted that it is lauded by both critics and savvy audiences alike as a benchmark film, the quintessential movie about pool, its players and hustlers, and the obsession and drive involved with wanting to be the greatest. What makes a movie great is when all the elements come together so beautifully, from the casting, acting, directing, cinematography, editing, etc., that it works virtually flawlessly both as a whole and as individual elements. The Hustler is one of those films. You could argue how you could have made it differently but you would be extremely hard pressed (or delusional) to claim you could have made it better. As anyone who has seriously acted or otherwise participated in a film or play will tell you, once enough of the right elements have come into play, the film or play will take on a life of its own and all the strengths will make each other stronger and better, the rare phenomenon of a group of individuals working on the highest common denominator, as opposed to the too frequent degenerating into the lowest common denominator. The casting is great with not a single weak performance anywhere from a young Paul Newman when he was at the peak of his craft, down to Jake LaMotta (the real 'Raging Bull') who plays a bit part as a bartender. The acting is so often brilliantly understated you might think you are watching a documentary, especially since the film is shot in stark black and white. The unflinchingly honest realism is one of the underlying elements that gives this film such great life. None of the characters or situations are glamorized, including the love between Eddie (Newman) and Sarah (Piper Laurie). They are two lost souls who are drawn together by their shared angst and alcoholism yet develop a true, powerful love that is heartfelt and realistic. They don't magically make each other perfect but they do bring each other some happiness and relief from their loneliness. Jackie Gleason is perfectly cast as Minnesota Fats, partly because he was 'The Great One', Jackie Gleason, but also because he really knew the game of pool. Probably Holloywood's greatest all time pool player, in real life he hustled full grown men when he was an eight year old kid. Incidentally, both Newman and Gleason did their own pool shooting in the movie, adding to the movie's realism. George C. Scott plays Bert Gordon, the powerful, dangerous hoodlum who controls the money and action for both Eddie and Fats. Scott gives such a fine performance you could easily imagine he would have been a real life Bert Gordon if he hadn't been an actor. If you want light, shallow fare, then 'The Hustler' is not for you. But, if you are looking for a great, honest movie that will haunt you as you remember many of the moments in dark poolrooms, where everyone smoked and drank too much back when they were socially encouraged and viewed as relatively harmless; a film that neither preaches nor glamorizes, it just shows what is, powerfully and unapologetically, so you are forced to draw your own conclusions as you see that everything has its price and that even for the supposed winners, there are no magical, happily ever after scenarios where everyone and everything is beautiful and perfect, but rather flawed and struggling to find an elusive state they will probably never achieve, then you will truly enjoy 'The Hustler', a great film.",10,9,13,27 January 2006
Capote," Two Hours of Begging for Oscar
","Capote seemed bent on presentation for presentation's sake, not trying to construct a picture as a stand alone work. I'm usually a fairly accurate judge of what I will like and dislike and so I had put off watching Capote because way too many people were buzzing about how hip Capote was. Usually whenever the general public talks about how hip or artistic something is they're discussing something that is a cliché, so familiar that it is hip in the cartoon sense, palatable for the general masses. Hardly something that is cutting edge or unique. Very much like the new sirloin burger at MacDonald's, not what I'd call real gourmet cuisine.The main reason I decided to finally watch Capote was because I had watched Infamous one night a month or so back and was so pleased I watched Capote the next night. The first night I was left surprised and thinking, the next I was left sleepy and disappointed. Capote was so busy with trying to create atmosphere and style it never developed the characters with anywhere near the depth that Infamous did so briefly and elegantly. The solid character development in Infamous was due to much better casting all around as well as a much more alive script with rich, layered dialog. I was impressed by all the performances in Infamous, even the usually commercially thin Sandra Bullock who, sans make-up, appears as real and convincing as I've ever seen her. By the way, who did the singing for Gwyneth Paltrow? If it was her, she may have missed her true calling. Capote on the other hand, most (almost all) of the characters were presented as thin, stock characters used to push the story along, as well as manipulate your emotions and mostly to support the starring role of Hoffman. As a side note, I'm usually a big fan of almost all instrumental soundtracks but the repetitive piano chords replayed over and over in Capote, an obvious and flaccid attempt to create a gloomy, heavy mood, became a distracting annoyance after the umpteenth time. By the end of Capote I was bored and distracted and felt that the obvious attempt to manipulate me as an audience member failed. I also felt detached and uninterested in all the characters, nothing had happened to give me a sense of their unique humanness or that most of them were real. Infamous on the other hand, I found to be one of the most intriguing and touching love stories I have seen in quite a long time. I happen to be a straight male who usually sees most theatrical (and public) displays of love as false, unconvincing and badly clichéd. Toby Jones and Daniel Craig were both very much alive and the love they created fascinating. And though they were of characters that I would not think I could find so interesting and feel so much for, a psychotic criminal and a gay society party boy, I was nevertheless quite touched by their love and seriously saddened by its tragedy. I was finally able to realize very clearly after Infamous why Truman Capote slowly self destructed after writing 'In Cold Blood'. It did the job of top notch cinema and art, it changed my perspective on many points. To paraphrase the Perry Smith character from Infamous, it had the most important element to writing and a great story and which Capote lacked: kindness.Granted, Mr. Hoffman does give an admirable performance in Capote but it's just that: a performance. He appears to be acting. To me the essence of great casting is to find someone who so fits the character they really don't need to act. Great acting should never be obvious, it should be invisible. Toby Jones was a much more accurate fit and gave a much more natural (and therefore believable) performance as the real Truman Capote than Philip Seymour Hoffman working so hard to act like Truman Capote.Capote was not bad but a bit of a moody disappointment, much like it's repetitive soundtrack, striking one chord over and over again in an overdone, calculating fashion. Infamous, on the other hand, was not only surprisingly more entertaining, richer and alive but I think a more accurate picture of the real Truman Capote than the rather one sided, coldly brooding version in Capote. If Mr. Capote were so cold blooded and ruthless I hardly think he would have been the darling of high society everywhere. Capote was adored by the party jet set everywhere when he was still happy and living life with such glee. And even though he could be a vicious gossip and somewhat of a backstabber he still had a tremendous charm and real affection for others, otherwise it's quite doubtful he would have had so many devoted friends. In Capote the charm and affection for others is just not there, certainly not as it is in Infamous, which paints a more human and humane picture of Mr. Capote.It's true that 'In Cold Blood' led to Truman's deterioration. If you want to see the underpinnings that were responsible for zapping his life away I think you'll find Infamous to be more accurate as well as a much more enjoyable motion picture experience.",6,2,6,7 August 2007
Blood Diamond," Cheap Zirconia
","I didn't know this was the same director who did 'Thirtysomething' until after I saw this film. Now it's obvious he's still doing the same material only with bigger budgets and pricier actors. I like DiCaprio very much, I think he has a lot of talent and is developing into quite a fine actor. I wished he hadn't done this one though. I don't know if the writing was just so badly clichéd, lifeless and tedious or if this was a character not within his range. Certainly the former is true: the writing sounds like a smugly self righteous thirty-something American who feels somewhat guilty for his good fortune in this mostly unfortunate world and tries to alleviate his guilt by preaching about some of the evils in Africa and how he has brilliantly realized the solution to these evils comes down to a simplistic little step we can all do here and now. Of course being a sheltered, usually very self absorbed thirty-something kid his insights and solutions are naively simplistic and unrealistic. The situation this film is based on is very complex and the problems are so entrenched due to so many differing factors that a cute, neat happily-ever-after Hollywood solution won't work no matter how much wishing and believing we want to do. As well, every time DiCaprio did the white African accent I had to wince a little because it sounded just slightly off key enough to not seem natural. I suppose I should mention Jennifer Connelly but after a few seconds with her character I kept turning away from the film and thinking of other things. She was so badly unrealistic as the savvy, seasoned reporter with her sophomoric self righteous indignation that she seemed to have been an irate and grotesquely self indulgent customer who was plucked from Macy's as she was raging at some poor clerk because the right shade of drapes aren't available that she 'absolutely needs' because they go with her new carpet and is now doing this tirade in the middle of Africa in the place of some reporter. Her character seems better fitted for a 'Twilight Zone' twist than anything resembling a reporter who has ever slept in a place worse than a Holiday Inn. (Ugh! Heavens no!) Djimon Hounsou gives the only credible performance of the three main characters but even he can't save this smugly false vehicle from crash burning into a pile of toxic clichés. Perhaps my sights were too high, I had really enjoyed 'The Constant Gardner' and felt everything worked very well in that slice of the exploited life in one of the way too many unfortunate places in Africa. But this was no Gardner, not even a part time one. This wasn't even a decent 'save the children' ad: at least the solution they offer may have some real merit, while this one was dreamed up by a detached arm chair observer who has come up with their solution by scanning page six of the Times and catching the tail end of a documentary or two. Like the solution for world peace given by a young beauty contest candidate, it has a lot of nice sounding words and phrases but it's nevertheless just a few cute platitudes that have no real practical value. Edward Zwick is way over his head here. I'd appreciate it if he'd stick to another 'thirty-something' venture. Those projects I can clearly see from far away are things I can avoid so as not to have my intelligence insulted by a smugly self righteous and self absorbed preacher who thinks he has all the brilliant solutions to all the problems and lives he hasn't the vaguest real knowledge of beyond what he's caught in a National Geographic article and thinks by looking carefully at the accompanying pretty pictures he can figure it all out.",5,3,6,22 April 2007
Sweet and Lowdown," Wonderful Movie about Love, Genius and Great Jazz Guitar Playing
","As Woody Allen said of Sean Penn after working with him on this film '(Sean's) a tremendous actor'. And he displays his tremendous talent in playing the role of Emmett Ray, jazz guitarist, a genius at his craft, rather a disastrous dope in all other aspects of his life.Then there's Samantha Morton who is brilliant in her portrayal of sweet, adorable Hattie, a cute mute young woman whose simple needs and wants, along with her lack of narcissism and inability to spew out mind numbing volumes of bulls+t banter obscure her deep strength and savvy intelligence. Those that value pure, sweet, unassuming kindness will find her irresistibly lovable.Emmett only really knows one thing, how to play guitar like no one else in the world, with the exception of the one person he idolizes to the point of hysteria: Django Reinhardt. He's obliviously inept at just about everything else in his life, especially his feelings, to the point where he doesn't know real, rare, wonderful love when it's right next to him. Sean is able to make Emmett so very likable, even in his worst of behavior. He excels at what he does best, bringing real human depth and qualities to his craft that exceptionally few actors are or have been capable of doing.This film is much like the character of Hattie, deceptive in its initial appearance and of a substantially better quality than you may first think. It seems like a light, cute little story largely due to its entertaining presentation and lack of dramatic pretense but there is significant texture and reality to this work of art. Emmett is perhaps the greatest guitar player in America and has so many of the essential ingredients for huge success: drive, ambition, presentation, wardrobe, personality, yet he tends to sabotage himself frequently and never gets the lucky break needed to put him at the top. True he could probably do rather well if he didn't p+ss away such volumes of cash but he never gets the type of success that the best supposedly deserve and is so wrought with money it won't disappear in the most extravagant lifestyles.Emmett also makes the tragically universal mistake of believing bullsh+t, both his and society's. He thinks the money and possessions and trophy girlfriends are what happiness are all about. His one saving grace is his love and respect for his craft but can this alone keep him from making a disaster of his life? He discovers all too painfully that the beautiful woman with the sophisticated, witty repartee, whom all the other men drool over, has an extremely high price tag of impenetrable, cold blooded narcissism. And though Emmett acts for the most part like a shallow dope, trying to hide and deny that besides being a genius he is a painfully sensitive man in desperate need of sweet, nurturing love, he still makes way too many foolhardy decisions. He is blind to the fact that the women who use sweetness merely as a tool of manipulation are the last thing he, or anyone else with a shred of decency, need or deserve.This is a great film and story and you can also enjoy a very pretty picture of life in the 1940's while you watch it.Apparently there was an obscure jazz guitarist named Emmett Ray but even if there wasn't, this is not really a fictionalized account. Certainly not in the sense of capturing the essence of character, love and genius. As he has done so marvelously before and since, Woody Allen masterfully captures an immensely watchable slice of life that most of us will only have an opportunity to witness with this fine offering. For the film itself as well as the two stellar leads this is will go into my relatively short list of wonderful, favorite films.",10,13,17,5 August 2007
