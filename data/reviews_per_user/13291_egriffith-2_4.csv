Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Meesa Thinka This Movie Sucksa
","Uh-oh! Meesa have to go potty! Ugh!! I don't care if anyone does want to defend Jar Jar, he helped to ruin one of the most anticipated movies of the last twenty years. But the blame doesn't rest squarely on Jar Jar's drooping shoulders. George Lucas did a good job ruining what could have been a great continuation of a very profitable franchise. Gungans? Metachlorians? It also deviated from the hero cycle of the previous movies and the three act classical structure. Which is okay, unless you can't replace it with something better-which they didn't. I was extremely let down after years of waiting for something that should have lived up to my expectations. Oh, and don't forget to go out and buy the thirty dollar letterbox edition. It's worth every penny.",Null,0,1,19 June 2000
Spider-Man," ....
","Sam Raimi has out done himself, this movie is almost good. Cut all the quasi-drama and rushed, yet bloated back story and you have some good action sequences.   Don't worry this movie's full of enough gimmicks that will dazzle your eyes on the big screen, but in the end you'll have an empty feeling probably because you don't have a clue why the movie wasn't good.Why does Peter Parker like Mary Jane? She's not even sexy. Perhaps the scene where her wet dress sticks to her body she comes close to being sexy.SPOILER:First she dates the class bully, dumps him the day of graduation, then goes for his rich friend. Another selfish girl in search of money and power. That sure describes the woman I want to call wife, or lover. 'hey mom she's just using me for money!'",Null,0,0,24 May 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Great film
","It's unheard of for me to sit down in a regal theater and sit through TV! commercials (yuck!) which cheapens the experience, then come out after watching the film without 20 things I can immediately point out wrong with the picture. This one was different. A+ writing, A+ Acting and A+ directing. Amazing Orchestration of filmmaking, props to actors and extra props to Winslet whom I believe carried most of the film.wow, good movie...finally. Take a hint Hollywood, it pays to be cerebral for some people, and portray emotion accurately. If you know films, and aren't the Jerry Brockheimer type, you should see it.",9,0,1,20 March 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," ZZZZZ....huh?Oh cool!...zzzz
","Bloated for the most part, with an excellent action interruption, and then a fat multi-end conclusion. This film is a flat ending to an otherwise well done trilogy.I think only die hard JRR fans will really dig it. Plenty of those, so no worries.Adapting novels to screenplays is difficult and it is sometimes important to keep the structure consistent with traditional cinema. I think in this case it could have used it. I think the fuzzy climax should have a quicker resolution to follow. I understand the novel also took some time to wrap up all the loose ends. For the movies we don't need a long resolution and the appearance of more than three logical places to end a film. Also, I am Shocked to realize Frodo has no real character arc compared to Sam and Strider.Could have easily been 2 and a half hours long.Excellent action sequences though, and a few good scenes and moments.Worth seeing once for resolution to trilogy. Arm yourself with a DVD remote and your finger on the fast forward button.",Null,0,1,28 December 2003
