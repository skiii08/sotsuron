Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A shadow of the originals.
","It's a shame people were so eager to enjoy this film simply because it was a Star Wars film. They defend it because George Lucas can do no wrong  - but he can, unfortunately he did it with the most anticipated film of the decade. Some set pieces regenerated the joy of a great star Wars - you know the ones, The Pod Race, the light sabre battle at the end - and they were great scenes. But between the clunky dialogue, a brat like child and the most unfunny alien since Mac and Me I was left feeling pretty empty. It's like watching someone who had no real understanding of what makes a Star Wars film and trying to replicate it. It shouldn't have been - but it was. The thing is Lucas CAN direct and write, but here after a break from the fold he is struggling. It takes more than amazing special effects to pull an audience in - hasn't Hollywood learned this yet? The site of a lone droid walking alone across a vast desert in the original is a more evocative image than any of the CGI cities and landscapes of TPM. It just seems more real somehow, and pulls the audience in. The Phantom Menace needs special effects, of course it does, but they were in every single scene - and thus took the awe away for the next one. The amount of CGI was overbearing, squashing the story and characters. Oh mumble mumble groan groan.However, this film isn't hurting anyone. It is a children's film as everyone points out when any flak is directed at it. But a great film has universal appeal, not just at kids. Adults should get a giddy sense of childish joy watching a great 'kids' film - like Toy Story. Lucas repeatedly said the first film was a kid's film, but it was very different - again, it had Universal appeal. That's why it has lasted and, say, Power Rangers have not.
I'm sure you'll like it - you probably will, but on a basic  level it's just not quite Star Wars.",2,0,1,20 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Cartoons
","If Count Dooku is a Jedi who is sick of the corruption in the Senate, then I'm pretty sick of the mindless corruption of this once great series. Now we have Star Wars Episode II - ATTACK OF THE CARTOONS.I love George Lucas - he is great story teller, but oh my God, is he bad at directing and writing. There's a good story here - it the birth of the Empire, Anakin is becoming dark, and somehow, I don't know how, George Lucas manages to make it all rather dull.***Possible Spoilers****I felt saddened by this film, it flirts with crashing through the barrier of Lucas's banal dialogue and clunky uninspiring direction - and a few times the thrill of seeing Star Wars creeps through, but is snuffed out quickly with more terrible dialogue, or another massive special effect that cracks you over the head with it's hugeness and puts everyone in the punch drunk state that Lucas requires his audience to be in. I'm sure people will say, 'but the dialogue was cheesy in all the films' - yep, it was. But it was also fun, and sometimes poignant.I also felt sad because people are hailing this film as one of the greatest ever. Have we really got so used to bad cinema? What should be great sequences under a better director are just plain dull - like the asteroid chase. The chase of the Bounty Hunter as the opener is floored because you can see they're just hanging in front of a blue screen and you know Anakin and Kenobi aren't in any real danger as they survive for the rest of the series. It still doens't stop Lucas from spreading this particular sequence out over about 20 minutes.Thank God for the Yoda fight and the bit at the very end where you see the Empire beginning to form.But in the meantime, Lucas will make his millions and take that as a sign he's doing a great job. Come on George, get a better writer and director in - Search your feelings, you know it to be true.",5,0,0,18 May 2002
