Black Swan," Fame Monster-Black Swan(2010)
","As I am no dancer, I'm not in a convincing position to say if to die for a swan queen role is all worth it. But what I can tell from the movie is that the fame is truly a monster! This mental thriller totally freaked me out with its strong-noted music and the ballerina's schizophrenia. The most scary thing is how real it is in depicting the stress and ambivalence a career-driven dying-for-success girl suffers, which finally leads to her disillusions and even self-mutilation.I assume Nina's mother influences Nina a lot, or even pins hope on Nina to realize the dream that she has failed to achieve, to become the swan queen of the Swan Lake. However, in order to play the seductive and dangerous black swan, Nina' felt victim to her jealousy and her sense of fear and insecurity, always imagining her biggest rival, Lily, is after her and ready to take the swan queen role from her.Nina began to see visions, such as black feather growing out of her shoulder. Devoured by the black swan queen's dark side, Nina stabbed into herself who she fancied was Lily. At the finale of the Swan Lake, she fell to the cushion and seemed can rise and gesture no more to the audience's ovation.Perhaps I already read critics' review and noted Natalie got her deserving Best Actress for her role as the mentally tortured dancer at this year's Academy Awards,I got so much expectation on this movie before watching it that when I finished it, I was actually a bit disappointed by my over-expectation.",5,2,4,4 March 2011
Skyfall," Great chemistry between Bond and Sévérine
","From the story itself, I don't think its well conceived as it's nothing new actually. A hard disk was lost and Bond was on a mission to get it back. He traveled to Shanghai, Macau, London and finally Scotland to defend his country,M and his belief. The bad guy was a victim of M's previous peace deal and had resources to blow off the MI6 head office and anything he wanted to destry or get in the world, unless Bond stopped him. And we all know that Bond would eventually kill the bad guy, no matter how many heartbroken losses we have seen, such as the terrifying death of Sévérine.Yet, what struck me is the chemistry between Bond and Sévérine. She trusted Bond and Bond proved worthy of her trust. They spoke the same language, such as their talk about fear and Beretta. They were made for each other. I personally thought it was a significant regret that she died of a terrifying death.Sévérine radiated such a stunning oriental beauty that I initially thought she were a Chinese actress. I liked her mystic accent, elegance and of course, the patent vulnerability of Bond Girl. I'm expecting the French actress to be more active on stage, and I highly recommend Chinese directors to consider this French lady for any upcoming international cooperations.",10,6,15,9 December 2012
Megamind," comedy, 3D, bad boy turns good
","Megamind is the movie that gave me the most surprises this year. Its story is a combination of The Incredibles and Despicable Me, though the 3D effect is a bit redundant.What could soothe me most apart from watching an innocent boy growing bad and then turning good again? At first I felt indignant for Megamind as the chance of being adopted by a decent family was snatched by Metro Man, and how he was treated in school saddened my heart too. The choice he was forced to make seemed understandable: if I cannot be the boy with the best behavior, then why not just be the bad boy?In this film,Megamind is not only a villain, but a human being with heart and feelings. His eyes can speak: how helpless and melancholy he is when Roxanne turned back on him at a rainy night. He was also childish in the way that he got really worried when he found he had no rival to fight with, and therefore decided to extract Metro Man's DNA in order to make a new hero. Obviously Megaman didn't have the evil plan that villains mostly have, say either rule the city or destroy it once and for all. Arguably it was Roxanne and the love inside him that saved his soul.The movie is full of surprises and light jokes, just thinking about what happened at Metro Man's little secret retreat resort and the comedic performance of Minion. The songs played out of the gigantic cassette player succeeded in making audience laugh out of breath. I empathized with Megamind so much that after the movie, the thought came to my mind that if it were a sad ending, I would not in the mood for anything joyous in the upcoming several days.",7,1,2,2 January 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men:The Last Stand
","The only impression that X-Men 3 left me was endless regret for Jean Grey(Famke Janssen), who killed her lover Scott Summer and our dear Professor Charlie Xavier (Patrick Stewart)with her sub-consciousness, and who was turned into a killing machine by Magneto(Ian McKellen). More sadly, she forced Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to kill his life-time lover with a piteous ending 'I Love You'.If audience has a choice to veto the sequel of X-Men, I choose to end this classic cartoon with the X-Men 2 once and for all. In X-Men 2, Jean sacrificed herself in the dam to power the jet which held lives of Logan, the professor, Scott and Storm(Halle Berry). I prefer her to die there instead of having a rebirth in the X-Men 3 as a schizophrenia patience, threatening to turn every living thing into molecule.My heart could never tolerate the pain watching Professor Charlie torn piece by piece by the crystal glass weapon sharpened and improvised by the mad Jean. Even Professor's life-long rival, Magneto, admitted it was his biggest loss to sacrifice the professor for his pursuit.Perhaps I would never comprehend why a peaceful world has to be earned by the pass-away of so many heroes, who are all great figures to inspire generation after generation. At this point, I felt lucky to live in a world with most of the things I have cherished standing by my side.",5,0,1,8 March 2011
Ghostbusters," reminiscent of the 1980s
","It was from today's newspaper that I first heard of Ghostbusters, where it was defined as a classic.Luckily enough, our lib gets one copy with Available status, so I took the chance to give it a watch. From its cover I saw it was made in 1984, and features two big stars of that time: Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver.To say what impressed me most, I would definitely name the erotic performance of Sigourney in this film, as my mindset always associated her with her roles in the Aliens series, where she starred as an iron-fist captain Ellen Ripley and fought with those violent unpredictable dangerous creatures on-and-off and was deemed as a a symbol of feminism rising in a new age.Back to Ghostbusters, I should say there's classic flavor in it, say the hippie music, the exaggerated comic scenes, and of course, the cars and clothes people were wearing at that time. Even all the faces inside gave audience a feeling of nostalgia and classic. I liked the opening scene featuring a screaming librarian and completely went nut when the three heroes went down from their fastfood fete to an emergency calling through a golden pool.This is not a thriller, but a downright comedy, with three psycho doctors and one black-skin Jesus believer running here and there in the NYC to exterminate all kinds of ghosts released from a refrigerator at the kitchen of Dana, the heroine. When it is time to meet the boss and the team was asked to choose in which form Gozer, the commander of all ghosts, shall destroy the city, one of the ghostbusters, Ray, thought of Mr. Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. I cannot help laughing and meanwhile adore the director's imagination and creativity.Even though there's barely substance Ghostbusters, I will give credit to the time it was made. It is highly likely that it is the movie that inspired so many ghost-themed science fictions afterwords. Yet, I wouldn't watch it again unless I am reminiscent of films in the 1980s.",6,1,3,13 February 2011
