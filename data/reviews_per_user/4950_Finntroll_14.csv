The Blair Witch Project," Impressive...
","...way of making money. This is a really clever trick, advertised in the best of ways by fooling many people that it was all happening for real. But as a movie it works quite bad. It suffers from both substandard acting and underdeveloped characters. It is probably meant to make it seem more 'real' but then again, what do I know. Before I saw this it had been hyped beyond imagination and I was not quite sure if it could live up to it and it later showed that it certainly couldn't. What we have here is just a very intelligent way of advertising and sadly not much else. The scares consists solely of a doll that's attached to a couple of sticks, and various strange sounds. Now I don't know about you but I don't find this scary at all.Despite being poorly made in every department except advertising it managed to reach a cult status and gross enormous amounts of money. It's a strange and unfair world we're living in.3/10",3,0,2,20 August 2004
Se7en," Dark masterpiece of the genre.
","David Fincher's breakthrough Se7en is one of few movies that deserves to be called a masterpiece. An incredibly dark movie (for mainstream that is) about cruelty and human depravity that hooks it's fangs into the viewers spine like a bloodthirsty beast and won't let go even after the movie's over. This is both very wellplayed and wellcrafted. Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey all do top-notch performances, the script is one of the strongest in years and the ending must be on of the best I've seen. It's strange that a movie that doesn't rely on shock effects can be this shocking. After I saw this I was amazed by the pure cleverness of it all and the way I felt. The depressing mood of it all is just perfect and it works wonderfully as a foundation on which this movie lies. Go see it now.10/10",Null,2,2,2 August 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Good remake.
","Zack Snyder. Who is this guy? I've never heard the name before and yet he has managed to make the best remake in recent times. 'Dawn of the dead' has always been one of my favorite zombie flicks, so naturally it should be impossible to better it, at least by remaking it. I can't really say that the remake is better than the original in any way but it's stands for itself.The tempo, compared to the old movie, is very high. The movie kicks off even before you know it. I somehow feel the movie could have been better if it was a little slower, since you often get to know people for about a second before they turn into zombies. Also the zombies run around like someone has filled their pants with fire-ants, which is a bit sad. I mean zombies are supposed to be slow and stupid.The FX are well made and the atmosphere is reasonably chilling. Whereas the old movie was a clever satire of the consumption and materialistic needs of our society this is more of a full frontal action/horror movie which makes it a lot less original but it's still made in such a good way that it smacks most of the opposition on the fingers.So, while it's not a patch on the original it's a pretty fine movie on it's own and probably the best remake this side of 'The Fly'. And by the way, gorehounds will not be disappointed.7/10",7,0,0,20 August 2004
Spice World," OH. MY. GOD.
","What happens if you take a talentless, brainless, tasteless, obnoxious pop product an try to make a movie about it? I'm surprised to say that you would probably get something better than 'Spice World'. The annoying Spice Girls, may Satan torture their soles forever, has made one of the worst movies of nineties, quite possibly one of the worst movies ever.Now you may wonder why I ever watched this if I hate Spice Girls so much. The answer amigo, is this: I had a bad hangover and unfortunately this was the only thing on the T.V. right then. Plot is nowhere to be found, decent actors are also completely absent, really annoying idiots however, are there plenty of here, but since this movie is about Spice Girls, it just couldn't be done without including five of the most obnoxious, irritating, stupid cows ever to be vomited out of the U.K.. If you're a bit retarded/stoned/drunk, it's Spice Girls I'm talking about right now. OK?Well anyway here's all you really have to know about this movie:It blows. Goats. As hell. The only people who might like it are those who really love Spice Girls. But those people probably won't be able to see this at the mental institutions they live in anyway.1/10",1,17,30,22 September 2004
The Thing," Horror classic.
","Time hasn't really been nice to John Carpenter, nowadays obviously spending most of his time wondering how to destroy his las ounce of credibility as a director. Luckily for him, 'The Thing' is a movie that will forever have him placed in the big league of horror masters among Lucio Fulci, Mario Bava, Wes Craven et.c.'The Thing' is a actually a remake of an old movie from the fifties. Carpenter has cleverly captured the fear and mistrust at a polar station when people are infected with a highly dangerous, well, thing that make them turn into killers. Very gory effects will satisfy every horror-lover's desire, chilling atmosphere makes one always wonder what will happen next. Put shortly this is a classic horror movie that will entertain anyone who's not fainthearted.8/10",9,0,1,28 August 2004
"I, Robot"," Better than you might suspect.
","Will Smith is back in the sci-fi genre, fortunately not as a man in black. 'I Robot' is a different kind of movie that blends paranoia with CGI in a pretty good way. The future is for once not a dark place were every one wears Ray-Bans and it always rains, but it is however full of robots. The people seem to have forgotten everything 'Terminator' was supposed to learn us. Smith is a police officer and the only person in the movie who doesn't trust robots. Everybody else makes fun of him because of this. Well I guess you can see were it goes from here, but 'I robot' actually manages to pull of some twists and surprises along the way, which makes it stand out among all the 'Bladerunner' imitators out there, while it's never as complex as, say, anything Hitchcock ever did, it's still enough to make you stay awake and actually enjoy his movie. The reason for this pretty low score is that it's quite obvious that this is a Hollywood movie. There are just a bit too much dumb jokes and sometimes the CGI gets a too central role in it and by the way, all violence is PG.Still an entertaining movie.6/10",6,0,0,21 September 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Massively overrated.
","Quentin Tarantino is one of our time's most gifted directors/scriptwriters and obviously also one of the most childish. Kill Bill vol. 1 is not as much a movie as it is a mishmash of older, cooler martial-arts and samurai movies from the 70's. The story is simple and can be summarized in one word: revenge. in fact the whole movie can be summarized in one word: copy.Uma Thurman plays the woman who's craving revenge, and a pretty bloody one too. The first scenes are actually crap really. Some of the worst dialog in a Tarantino movie ever is spoken and a dull fight takes place. The good thing is that the movie doesn't get worse from here, but it doesn't improve much either. The only thing that I'll remember for some time is the gruesome anime sequence, otherwise the movie is just scene after scene that's been stolen somewhere, been made to look a bit prettier but actually also to work much worse. Uma Thurman is just not very good at handling a sword, and the surreal atmosphere is more strange than anything else. I know that Tarantino really loves samurai movies but he could have made a real movie instead of making two, inferior commercials about them!All in all this is one of the most overrated movies ever, and I think it's more that people want to stay loyal to Tarantino than anything else.5/10",5,4,7,5 June 2004
Big Fish," Truly terrible movie.
","'Big Fish' has for reasons beyond me been hailed as a modern classic by many a viewer. The story is about an insane, self-centered chronic, liar (played by Albert Finney), who tells the story of his life to his neglected son (Billy Crudup). Of course the father lies about his life and comes up with a lot of stupid tales about himself as young (Ewan McGregor).What I don't get about this movie is how people can like a person as reprehensible as Ed Bloom. Not only is he an arrogant S.O.B. who can't talk about anything but himself, he was also a bad father and probably also a bad husband, which is somewhat implied by Jessica Lange's restrained and depressing performance. Also, Ed Bloom seems to get sad every time someone tells him that he's not funny and tries to make him act sane for at least one time in his life. Wait scratch that, first he's sad and then he tells another story. I found it impossible not to hate him. Which is strange because everyone in the movie loves him, and I have no idea why. The only scene I really enjoyed was when he got beaten up.Some things aren't awful though. The sets and Alison Lohman look great and... Well that was about it. Otherwise this is just two hours of pure horse-manure.I could ramble on about all the pointless, sugarcoated, sentimental crap that this movie is stuffed with, but honestly I just want to erase it from my mind.",3,15,30,18 May 2005
The Fly," Fun goreflick.
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* Jeff Goldblum. What do you think when you read that name? Exactly. Mad scientist. Goldblum must be one of the most typecasted actors in the business and for a good reason. He just happens to be the best mad scientist there is.I'm pretty sure that Goldblum hasn't done any better at doing what he does best than in 'The Fly'. Here he plays a pretty strange geek who invents a teleporter, doesn't sound like much fun but I can assure you it really is. He uses the teleporter on himself but a fly comes with him on the ride and his and the fly's genes connect and makes Goldblum to a flyman or something. The new fly-Goldblum gets supernatural strengths and even manages to get a girlfriend (the lovely Geena Davis)  whom is pretty impressed by his endurance, but somethings going very wrong, very quickly.This movie is probably not for wimps but everyone else is in for an exciting ride complete with cheesy settings that oozes  monstermovies from the fifties and pretty full-on gore. This is by no means a masterpiece but it's damned good fun while it lasts. Well worth checking out!7/10",7,0,1,15 July 2004
Scream," Pretty good.
","Many people hate this movie. And maybe they should, after all hideous films that have tried to copy this one (Valentine, anyone?) it's no hard thing to do. Scream still stands as the best of the genre it invented i.e. the 'slasher-wannabe' genre. This means it tries to be something it actually isn't. Scream is not a slasher movie, plain and simple this is just a thriller dressed up for Halloween.The story is simple; a man murders teens just like in numerous real slasher films. This is what makes the movie pretty funny to watch, there are dozens of jokes that relate to films of the slasher genre. A pretty solid cast makes this work fine. Neve Campbell (what's she doing nowadays?) is probably the best of the lot and she looks wonderful too. A crappy ending makes the movie a bit less entertaining but it's still fun to watch and well recommended both for those who know the horror genre well and beginners.7/10",7,1,2,15 July 2004
Trainspotting," No holds barred.
","'Trainspotting' is one of the strongest and best movies of the nineties. The subject deals with skag addicts in the most realistic of ways. Their is feel to this movie that make it look like a documentary. That's probably a reason for people to hate it. The common man these days is just to fueled up on Hollywood and the happy-go-lucky movies and don't want to see the terrible problems that exists in our world. This is indeed a pretty graphic movie but this full on style suits me perfectly.The slick camera work and editing makes 'Trainspotting' reach a higher level and a solid cast helps it too. Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle are really good and adds dimension and depth to their characters.This movie was a great success in Europe, particularly in UK but was never big in USA. Many critics say that this is because 'Trainspotting' is glorifying heroin but it's actually pretty obvious that it doesn't. The atmosphere is dark and you can see how the characters suffer when they abuse the drug.'Trainspotting' is a must see, and you ought to rent it right now.9/10",Null,1,2,7 July 2004
Signs," For wimps only.
","M. Night Shayamalahayamahan or whatever showed the world that he wasn't really the heir to Hitchcock's throne at all by making this tiresome, stupid film about crop-circles and alien invasions and whatnot. Well this is unimaginative and plain boring at best.First of all the movie is really dull. Sure, an alien movie doesn't need to be fast-paced to be great (Alien anyone?), but it has to interesting in some way, 'Signs' plain ain't. Then it's also stuffed with clichés and, ugh, Mel Gibson plus a boring, tedious side story and some of the wimpiest, ugliest, most unscary aliens since Nukie. It also has a flaw that is so big that the whole movie becomes completely illogical: anyone who watched this movie and liked it, may I ask you: why didn't the aliens disintegrate in the air? It has a lot of water you know.Please avoid this movie. You will probably save yourself from a lot of cursing and throwing stuff at the TV.",3,3,5,27 December 2004
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Quite possibly the funniest movie ever!
","Somewhere in time comedy seems to have gone rancid. I may sound like an old geezer right now (which is pretty strange since I'm not even twenty), but nowadays almost every comedy is a ripoff of another. Just look at all the Scary movies, American Pies et.c. It sure is a good thing that Monty Python and the Holy Grail exists, it's almost 30 years since it was made and it's still one of the funniest and most entertaining movies in the comedy genre. Nay, it's probably one of the best in ANY genre.This movie is set in the wonderful world of Monty Python. Home of the incredibly brave Black Knight, the Swampcastle, witches and hundreds of things you'll remember for years after you watch it. Bellylaughs are more than common, if you don't laugh yourself senseless at sir Lancelot's quest to free an imprisoned son (daughter?) you should seek some kind of professional help. Shortly put: your life will be much more boring without this movie.10/10",9,2,5,29 August 2004
Gangs of New York," Fall from grace.
","Martin Scorcese is one of the most known and loved directors in the business, responsible for masterpieces such as 'Goodfellas', 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull', he will always be remembered as one of the truly great. Unfortunately Scorcese's career and movie making has turned stagnant and 'Gangs of New York' is proof of that.First off, there's the actors. Leo DiCaprio is very pale in his role and looks somewhat distant, Diaz is unfortunately not very good either, Daniel Day-Lewis however plays off a remarkable performance as the bad guy.Second, the pacing is slow and plodding. The first half of the movie was so slow and boring, mainly because of boring acting, that I had to watch it three times before I got through it, luckily the second half is better, not because acting improves but because more things happen.Overall the story is neither very engaging, most because you don't feel anything for Di Caprio's character, Amsterdam.Overall, Scorcese's 'Gangs of New York' is a tired effort.5/10",5,1,3,11 October 2004
