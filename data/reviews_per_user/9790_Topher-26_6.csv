Requiem for a Dream," Trendy garbage
","If you've seen Rush (1991), Drugstore Cowboy and Trainspotting, you've seen it all, and better.Requiem For A Dream is nothing else but fancy camera shots, superfluous abusive scenes destined to shock the audience (yawn...), and a vacuous storyline. I'm sure the teens love it.*spoilers*I found the mother to be the only interesting character of the entire film. Her dreams of fame and fortune seem unreachable, she's a widow, and thinks her prescribed drugs are harmless. She's misinformed and alone. It is just a very sad situation. In the meantime, the 3 brainless kids play wilfully with fire (and get burnt), fully informed of the danger, just trying to be smartasses. Too bad, they lose. Expectable. Good riddance. End credits.This is basically a 2-hour anti-drug commercial. Period.*end spoilers*After 'Pi' and then this, I sincerely hope Darren Aronofsky's next movie is not once again about the protagonist on drugs. It's already getting old.If you feel the need to watch disturbing movies with content, I'd rather recommend 'Seul Contre Tous (I Stand Alone)' and 'Irreversible' by Gaspar Noe, 'Repulsion' and 'The Tenant' by Roman Polanski, 'Possession' by Andrzej Zulawski, 'Sombre' by Philippe Grandrieux, 'Les Amants Criminels' by Francois Ozon, 'Last House On The Left' by Wes Craven, 'Tetsuo (The Ironman)' by Shinya Tsukamoto...Good luck sitting through these !",3,0,2,24 January 2003
The Beach," Great for teenagers
","This movie is not terrible. It is watchable. To me, it looks obviously directed to a 12-year old audience and was unfortunately marketed as a movie for everyone, hence the general criticism.Di Caprio is much better in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' and 'The Basketball Diaries'. Virginie Ledoyen is much better in 'Fin Aout, Debut Septembre' or 'Jeanne Et Le Garcon Formidable' and Guillaume Canet is much better in 'Barracuda' or 'Je Regle Mon Pas Sur Le Pas De Mon Pere'. You can also see both Virginie and Guillaume in 'En Plein Coeur'. Even though the latter is a very average movie, at least their performances should convince you that a movie like The Beach is not worthy of their talent.",Null,0,0,31 January 2002
This Is Spinal Tap," Why all the fuss ???
","Indeed, this movie is a nice satire but it's really only funny at times. Actually, the guy I was watching it with left halfway through the film and I was dying to turn off the TV when the end credits started rolling (but I didn't because the movie carries on during the credits).It's okay... it's meant to be absurd and make fun of the rock bands that reason and live the way the characters do but still, I expected more than this...The amp to 11, the vanishing drummer, the piano piece, all that was funny but definitely not hilarious !... If this is supposed to be hilarious, where do you place Monty Python then, for instance ?I think it deserves a 5 out of 10.",8,2,7,31 March 2001
Mission: Impossible," Typical over-rated Hollywood garbage (a few spoilers)
","I tried to give a chance to this film on 3 different occasions.Unfortunately, this movie is so bad that it is impossible to focus on what's going on because watching insects fly by your TV screen is more captivating.The idea of Tom Cruise hanging by a rope not being supposed to touch the ground or the walls was definitely lifted from 'The Treasure Of Four Crowns' (1982) and there's nothing less plausible than a helicopter in a tunnel anyway...All in all, this is just another bad movie by very over-rated (yet eclectic) director Brian De Palma whose most successful films had mainly a good story (that he rarely wrote). 'Mission: Impossible' is the ultimate proof that a movie is worthless without a good story, no matter how famous the director is.How Emmanuelle Beart wasted her time and talent being a part of this money-hungry production is still a mystery to me.",Null,0,0,15 August 2002
Am√©lie," Good, but not all that.
","I know I really may sound like a party-pooper but I just didn't find this film all that great. However, the lighting is gorgeous and the guy should have definitely got an Oscar for that. Audrey Tautou as Amelie is perfect (her talent was already perceivable in 'Venus Beaute (Institut)' despite her small part in the movie), and Jeunet's touch is there - maybe a bit too much actually, given how reminiscent it is of his cinematography on the City Of Lost Children (not to say identical).There are also numerous cultural references for which I'm dying to see how they were translated into other languages, and the surprising presence of comedians who are well-known to the French audience to add to the fun (Yolande Moreau, Jamel Debbouze, Ticky Holgado, ...).On the commented version of the DVD (at least the French pressing), Jean-Pierre Jeunet makes references to Frank Capra (the scene in the bar between Amelie and Nino), Wim Wenders (the man and the box in the phone booth) and Sergio Leone (the shot of Amelie in the train station) - the problem is that the same kind of scenes shot by these directors have an intensity that is light-years away from what I felt watching 'Amelie Poulain'. The commentary is actually concluded by the filmmaker stating that he couldn't care less for the anachronisms in the film.Overall, you get an arty comedy directed to mass audiences with a very thin plot that everyone can understand without thinking too hard, and a good cast performing below their usual abilities. The whole wrapped up in a fairytailish package that, even if it is cute and without much pretense, still keeps me wondering if it is uplifting enough to come out of the movie theater with a big smile on your face, and the will to change the world like so many people seem to experience after watching this film.",6,2,5,23 April 2002
V for Vendetta," Worst piece of drivel I've seen in years.
","I liked Bound, hated the Matrix (and yes I 'got it', thank you). The trailer already made V for Vendetta look like utter garbage but I still gave it a try with an open mind and oh my God... I wasn't prepared for this !American actors trying to imitate the British accent by throwing around words like 'bollocks', 'bugger off' & 'bloke', sitcom acting from Natalie Portman (seriously, does she actually get paid ? Even when she says she's starving you can't believe her), the most uninspired fighting scenes, shallow pseudo-philosophical statements, simplistic politics and morals, and the unavoidable Wachowski question: 'Do you get the subtle message behind the movie ?'I think the real problem is that people seem to think that the Wachowski brothers are the kings of allegory and that this actually is a good movie ! What do these people watch or read the rest of the time ? This is truly scary. No wonder the author of the book refused to have his name mentioned in the credits.Now, I 've never been able to give a 1 to a film but I think this one really deserves it. It was already painful and embarrassing to watch from the very first minutes. You're definitely better off watching the B-movies that inspired it: Fantomas, Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, the Abominable Dr. Phibes or an episode of Zorro... At least, they don't take themselves as seriously.",6,3,11,7 November 2006
