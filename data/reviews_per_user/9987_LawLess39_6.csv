10 Cloverfield Lane," Yawn!!!
","The real 'Star' of the movie is the bunker. The 'common area' is nicely done. Roomy, I like the arched ceiling. the cooking area is nice ... I may have gone another direction ... but it does work.Goodman(Howard)'private space' leave a lot to be desired. The shower looked like an after thought. I would have attached it to the common area, between the stairs and the entrance doorway. Certainly would make it much bigger. Since there was no hint of where the water was coming from ... I'll go with he had a good supply. Then there is the stealth generator supplying and abundant source of electricity. The food storage looked adequate enough I would have expected more than was shown. I would have had a much better radio comms set up. And .... P-L-E-A-S-E!!! the air ventilation system? There is no way to access the breakers (I didn't see any filtration), once you're secured in the bunker?!?! Who designs an air filtration system that only some scrawny girl can access by crawling through the ducting?!?!? And the intake is where? I'll stop there ... there is a lot more that don't work ... but realism is clearly not the objective of this movie.Not much in the way of a story line here either. Goodman could have smoked a few J's before each scene and it would not have been noticeable. Who wrote this ... a grade school English class?What was the purpose of John Gallagher Jr's character? Give Goodman somebody to shoot?Opening a 40 gallon drum of acid (really?) in a bunker like that would have killed them all rapidly ... never mind standing over it breathing the fumes!Since 'Mr. Prepared' had no NBC suits, of any kind, Susie Cream-cheese (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)has to make one (Ala MacGyver)out of a plastic soda bottle, shower curtain and ... the handy mans best friend ... Duct Tape!Later ... the 'Kraken' appears and sucks the soda bottle mask off her face. Then ... hanging from a - dangling - pickup she tosses a Molotov cocktail into he jaws of ... what is that thing anyway?After a 50 foot(?) drop, nose first, in the truck ... into the ground 'Little Susie' gets into a car and ... at night ... hers being the only light for miles ... makes a speedy get-away ... no 'Kraken' to be seen?This movie is beyond a joke, it pathetic. Did this really cost $20 mil to make??? Attack of the Killer Tomato's is better than this. I cold make a better movie than this! If you want a good movie about drama in close spaces ... then watch 'Run Silent Run Deep'.Goodman should toss this stinker into the barrel of acid and go ask the 'Dude' for forgiveness!The other actor/actress? They should change their names and take measures to disguise themselves ... hopefully this won't stain their careers to much. But ... taking into account the lousy movies Hollyweed has been putting out? Maybe not.Expecting Actors and Actresses to compensate for talent-less movie makers, although the current trend, just don't get it done. Even though this only cost us $6 to watch ... it was a wasted $6 ... not to mention our time.",1,4,10,8 August 2016
The Finest Hours," Disappointing
","Unfortunately I have been to sea on an old converted (to a bulk carrier) T2 Tanker ... and worked on and stood a watch in the engine room. These ships 'engines' were Steam Turbo Electric. The only way these engine rooms could have been that quiet ... is if the plant was completely shut down.The men on the tanker would not have been able to stand up. There is no 'engine intake' or 'ahead' or astern' nozzles. So, for me, that part of the movie was pretty sad ... at least give these men the respect of attempting to make it realistic?The Coast Guard scenes? Don't know wasn't in the CG. However ... for that little boat to completely submerge (several times)and still have the engine running? The men involved earned some respect here ... this movie fails miserably and fails to acknowledge (through any kind of realism) the acts it took to bring those men home. The other period details were pretty good even though it was mostly CG.Maybe they should have somebody that has actually been to sea? So I'm going with the lowest I can give. Basing a movie on a true story is not a license to degrade it.It is 117 (wasted) minutes of my life I will never get back.",1,18,33,26 May 2016
Deepwater Horizon," It was entertaining anywa
","So I gave it an extra star. Other than the 'big boom' ... all I took away was ... the 'hint' at ... a poorly maintained rig ... by a undisciplined, poorly trained crew that seemed to be more interested in being comics than doing their jobs. For example ... when those valve bonnets started to give out ... they should have evacuated. There was a conspicuous absence of alarms going off? Of course I've had experience with machinery ... hollyweed has not.Then there seems to be a distancing from BP by bringing up the ... 'it's BP's oil well ... but not their rig'. The phones don't work? The monitors go 'blue' and this thing was still in service? US ships (Oil Tankers for example) have the ABS and USCG regulating them. Do these rigs have anyone (standards) to answer too? There is a on-the-fly 'hand off' meet on the helio deck? That nobody can hear because of the noise? The bang-boom-whoosh CG was good and the 'Die Hard' like scramble to survive was entertaining enough.There is an entertainment value to this movie ... so, $6? OK. Still ... the the 'oil spill data' at the end was bogus. There was a complete absence of the 'dispersant' BP, tried to hide, used to dummy up the spill numbers and - in the process - poisoned the gulf of Mexico? Oil spills are measured on the surface. So ... braking the oil down and getting it to 'mix' with the water keeps this number ... and the penalties ... down.Whether is is BP or Transocean ... it was still a matter of protecting their collective 'bottom' lines. This did not have to happen.",2,8,15,11 January 2017
Passengers," Boring
","I give it a 2, because of what it is ... a movie with no hollyweed morality ... nobody comes out-of-the-closet ... no gender confusion ... just boy sees girl ... boy unfreezes girl ... girl finds out and an hates boy ... have crisis ... girl loves boy and boy gets girl. Pretty simple stuff.The plot? If there is one ... sucks, of course. Here you have a deep space ship ... on auto pilot ... the defenses are over whelmed by space rocks and the ship tries to repair itself. One does wonder ... if the ship can repair itself (or can't)... why can't it bring the required crew members out of stasis to fix things?If they cannot go back into stasis ... then how did the girl expect to get back to earth? Our hero managed to 'hack' into the deluxe suite, but couldn't 'hack' into the food synthesizer? But yet he figures out how to repair the engines?There are no small utility craft or shuttles? They have to use the same - sorry - tether we've seen in a bunch of other space movies?90% of this move could have been made in a high school cafeteria and shopping mall. This is a waste of time ... unless you want to watch a normal couple, for a change. It would have been better if the crew woke up to their descendants standing there?At lease it did not make you want to vomit.",2,2,4,15 March 2017
U-571," I liked it
","This is another in the line WWII Submarine movies. Such as ...'Crash Dive' ... 'Run Silent Run Deep' ... 'The Enemy Below' ... 'Destination Tokyo'To name a few.There were, a recorded total of, 4 U Boats captured during WWII. None of them were taken by 'commando raid' So yeah .... it is just a movie, so ... lighten up!There were no Zombies ... Vampires ... scrawny girls firing guns that are to big for them, beating the crap out of dudes three times their size. No slim, blood dripping off everything and nobody came out-of-the-closet. It was enjoyable!There is a plot!Although this did not have the 'strong' manly characters of old (except for Harvey Keitel, maybe) ... these folks got the 'job done'.I found the attention to detail good and allowed me to get immersed in the movie.This is not a chick flick! So it is understand able it is hard to find male actors that can stand on their own - as men. This does detract from the movie some ... but in the end ...This is a very entertaining movie.",6,1,5,13 November 2016
The Nice Guys," I don't get it
","There is nothing to this move. Other than some pretty good - adult - comedy spots ... it truly sucks. My biggest issue/problem is how dare they incorporate a 12 year old girl into a debauchery/porn riddled movie! Are the writers pedophiles? Is going to be some 'new trend'? What kind of parents would let their 12 year old daughter be in a part/movie like this??? This just wrong. The T&A was good ... about time there was something bedsides 'beef cake' in movies! But lose the girl! Then there is the, rather porky, Russell Crowe. This in itself was a crack up. Crowe did good as a mindless thug in LA Confidential, but not in this movie. Other than comic relief ... his character was pointless. Actually the whole movie was pointless.Gosling? What a douche. I didn't get his part at all ... a drunken, stone retard? Then there was the bimbo ... of all the 'fully developed' women in this movie ... why pick a scrawny girl for a lead role? How can I forget the plot. Easy there isn't one. A porn movie with a social message? I thought better of Russel Crowe ... not so much now.This movie (for lack of a better term) is a waste of time to watch, and was a waste of time and monies to make!",1,9,18,26 November 2016
