It," Terrible!!!
","What a joke. I walked out 3/4 through it. Basically the only thing the movie had in common with the book was the names and a similar story line. Imagine 'IT' being written by a high school student, instead of King, and receiving a C+... Thats what it is... Utter garbage, what an insult to King (like most of his books-to-movies). And lets see, Oh.. The F-bomb.. Every other word out of all the kids mouth was the F-Bomb(seems like), Bev, a social outcast in the book, looks like a hot 20 something hooker/slut. And the clown... Bad... Again, don't wast your money on this flop...",1,10,19,19 September 2017
