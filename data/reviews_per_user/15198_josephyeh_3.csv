Captain Phillips," It's been a while since I have been this tense
",First off I would like to say that this is one of my favorite movie of all times and I'm usually extremely picky when it comes to movies. It exceeded my expectation in every single way possible and let's just say I had a really high expectation to begin with. The acting in this movie was stunning. Hank did an amazing job as a likable Captain Phillips while Barkhad exceeds in his character as a scary villain yet someone who we feel like deserves our empathy too. The production design in this movie is really well done and the directing is FREAKING amazing.The pacing of this movie is great and I loved the way they delivered the climax. The way they blend the emotion and tension in this movie was pretty balance without over doing it. My experience with this movie is honestly one of the best two hours of my life. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie through and thanks to the great performance I could feel that I was in the same boat as Captain Phillips (no puns intended). This is truly a great movie and I would recommend it to everyone who likes thrillers because this is one heck of one!,10,7,9,3 July 2016
Cloverfield," Wanted to shoot myself after watching this!
",This is honestly one of the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The movie absolutely have no story line and only features a bunch of stupid teenagers wondering around New York City. The cinematography is soooooo awful that it gave me a major headache after. Just don't even get me started on the acting because I will puke whenever I think about it. Whoever think that this movie is good should have their TV taken away from them till they learn what a good movie should be. I literally lost all my respect in J.J Abrams along with all the other people involved in making this film. This is a warning to avoid this movie at all cost and if you see a Cloverfield DVD you should burn it IMMEDIATELY!,1,1,3,25 May 2016
Whiplash," Not bad but overrated
",Whiplash may seem like an very original movie but really the story line is very shallow. I honestly just don't see where the story is going in Whiplash and at the end there seem to be a 'meh' feeling of disappointment. Whiplash however does have its moments and the acting is phenomenal. I like the intensity and drama associated with Fletcher but story line wise there really is not much too it. Although don't get me wrong because Whiplash is a quality movie is just that the story it's pretty disappointing. So my advice to you on watching this movie is that don't expect too much from it because you really won't get anything out of it.,6,0,2,25 May 2016
