The Ring," Creepy as hell...
","With images that remind me of both Nosferatu and rotten.com, this film has the ability to stick in your brain like the corpse you saw on the side of the highway when you drove past a fresh wreck.  This is not a kind film. It does not want to reassure you.  The imagery alone is reason to see this movie, but it also is supported by a well paced mystery-plot and solidly scared acting.  The filmmaker obviously has some background in psychology, as this work twangs at that black cord inside you, giving you the most uncomfortable vibrations from scenes like a child drawing the same frantic circle over and over again, to the movement of a pen, to the sun filtering through leaves.  Even the way the movie starts...i didn't realize til later...its very sudden, like putting in a videotape that hasn't been fully rewound - a subtle touch.  I have not seen Ringu, the original Japanese film that this is based on, but i now plan to.  I would put this in my top 5 horror films of all time.",Null,0,0,2 November 2002
