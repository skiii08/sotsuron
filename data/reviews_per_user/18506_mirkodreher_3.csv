Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Funny but not funny enough
","Will ferrel can be a lot funnier. To be honest, i think he is the funniest person on this planet. But he doesn't show everything he's got in this movie. The story old and told a thousand times, but you can watch it for a few laughs. Not that bad.",5,0,1,13 November 2019
