The Monuments Men," Is art really worth someones life....
","Don't go to 'The Monuments Men' expecting to see a flippant WWII 'Ocean's Fourteen.' It's deliciously entertaining, but deeper than that. Though George Clooney is leading an all-star crew through a daring heist — rescuing occupied Europe's greatest art treasures from the Nazis — this is a sturdy, old-school, big-scale Greatest Generation war movie. It's great escapism.The unlikely story is about true-life heroism, not irony. It's frequently funny yet earnest at heart. Directing, starring and co-writing, Clooney honors unheralded men who made a crucial contribution to the war for civilization. It's a story about men risking lives to save Western culture's greatest achievements from brutes who saw books and timeless art as tinder and kindling.The stakes are clear from the opening scene, with Da Vinci's wall mural 'The Last Supper' near collapse after an Allied bombing raid on Milan in 1943 reduced the refectory housing it to rubble.'The Monuments Men' follows the fictional characters of art conservationist Frank Stokes (Clooney) and museum director James Granger (Matt Damon) as they recruit a half-dozen artists and experts to preserve masterworks. The squad includes Bill Murray as an architect, John Goodman as a sculptor, Bob Balaban as a theater impresario and Jean Dujardin as a French resistance fighter.They're an odd lot, gifted and flawed, and they don't always get along with each other or their pragmatic GI counterparts. The film doesn't squander a lot of time building background stories for them. With iconic faces and talents like these, that's unnecessary. Goodman conveys more with the twitch of an eye than pages of dialogue can tell, and the comic friction between Murray and Balaban is as sly as anything in a Christopher Guest movie. These actors have a sense of identity from the get-go.The film looks stupendous, with Normandy Beach, Paris, snow-covered Belgian forests, castles and cathedrals gloriously photographed by Phedon Papamichael. The olive drab and gray of the military equipment and uniforms offer a striking contrast to the beautiful jewel tones of the art on display.Most of the artwork in peril features religious subject matter, a canny choice on Clooney's part. It's shorthand for the way art inspires and enriches our daily lives, and for most viewers it carries deeper emotional associations than secular works by Vermeer or Rembrandt.Cate Blanchett throbs with suppressed rage as a Paris curator forced into cooperation with Nazi art looters. She'd be executed on the spot if they realized she was secretly cataloging the destinations of national treasures being carted away for display in Hitler's proposed Führer Museum. To recapture that beauty — there are worse reasons to risk your life. Her ardor helps convince even skeptics that there's more than canvas and paint and chiseled stone at stake here.The film is episodic, and it could have been stronger with a centerpiece conflict between the old, out-of-shape scholars and a nemesis. Even so, it's strong work, with a sense of the capricious ebb and flow of history. The offhand way the squad learns that the war has ended is a delightful throwaway.The film's emotional peak hits at a time, and in a way, you're unprepared for. While a medic (played by Clooney's co-writer Grant Heslov) works on a gravely wounded soldier, Murray hears a homemade recording of his grandchildren singing 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' over the camp PA system. At moments like that, and during the touching cameo appearance by Clooney's father, Nick, you know you're watching one straight from the heart. And that's right where it hits you.",7,9,18,8 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks is evergreen
","Based on a true story Captain Phillips is a great thriller, about Somilian pirates kidnapping a ship captain after abducting his ship. The film starts of slow but as soon Rich Phillips gets kidnapped the film takes a great turn. The climax and pre climax will get your heart pumping, it was a thrilling end, but at the end of film after Hanks is all safe sound and the doctors are checking him out, one sheds a tear looking at hanks response to the doctor, he emotes emotions so well in that scene, its a killer. Tom hanks adds another great performance to his ever growing list. A must watch for all moviegoers who like thrillers or for anybody that wants to watch a good movie.",7,1,3,19 November 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," A good psychological thriller about the unknown. John Goodman is amazing!
","10 Cloverfield Lane,is what I classify as a film about the unknown (aliens)its a film where the world is (sort of) coming to the end. And let me tell you weekly now Hollywood comes out with films, about aliens, and the end of the world, so with that one liner 10CL probably seems like yet another gimmicky, VFX heavy film, were the whole world is being destroyed, and everyone is dying until there is one saviour etc. But luckily 10CL separates its self from that mess, this film rather than relying on gimmicks builds tension through its characters,its more about surviving than fighting the unknown. Its an old fashioned thriller, that rather than scaring its audience, creates a paranoiac, cluster phobic eerie feeling in the audience. Its a realistic take on what the mynas predicted. But is the film worth a watch in theatres, well lets analyze.Story wise Michelle packs her things and leaves her apartment, angry over a dispute with her partner Ben.While driving away she turns on the radio,it claims that there are numerous blackouts in major cities. Michelle becomes distracted after Ben calls her, and her car crashes and goes off the road from the distraction, flipping upside down. When she awakens, she discovers she is chained to the wall in an unknown location. After reaching her phone only to receive no signal, a man named Howard enters the room and tells her he saved her life and the world outside is now uninhabitable due to the nuclear or chemical fallout from 'an attack.' What happens next forms the films main crux.Acting wise John Goodman is at his crazy maniac best. His act draws comparison to me to Christian Bale in American Psycho, and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, but to a lesser a extent obviously. Its a iconic role, of a crazy old man who will go to any extent to keep things as they are. Watch out for scene when he gets burned by acid, and his reaction. This might be his career best act. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is helpless, and in sorrow, and she conveys her emotions well with a pale look, and with her distraught eyes. In the climax when she escapes, and fights the unknown one roots for her to win, and thats how one knows she has succeed in her act. These above mentioned main characters are the main reason why 10CL is so enjoyable. John Gallagher Jr gives great comic relief.10 Cloverfield Lane is not a sequel to Cloverfield, its more of a franchise film I presume, with more films to come in the series with such a open ending. At a runtime of 1hr 45 min 10CL never gets slow or bores, the film builds tension perfectly, and the films first time director Dan Trachtenberg makes sure that films main set 'the bunker' gives the audience a very cluster phobic feeling, and therefore the film gets your heart racing in panic at every thrilling instance. A example of this is the scene when Michelle steals the keys and tries to escape, but instead sees, a lady die in front of her due to the contaminated air. Its a scary thrilling moment.The film has a very dark, and eerie setting that works well with the films content. The films story and screenplay is not very novel, however the films presentation is very different than the usual world vs alien film. Here there is not many gimmicky effects or cheap graphic thrills, rather 10CL is a psychological thriller. The film is also greatly supported by the performances of the leads both John Goodman, and Mary Elizabeth are both extraordinary. I am usually am not a fan of films about the end of world but I quite enjoyed myself here. On the flip side, while 10CL is good and thrilling, the film just couldn't elevate itself from being good to extra ordinary till the pre climax/climax. And even the climax is rather unconvincing and leaves a sour taste in ones mouth. The film technically and production value wise is average, but this film is not supposed to be a very glossy film, so its adequate.Overall 10 Cloverfield Lane is a good psychological thriller, that offers genuine scares. Great performances, and some thrilling moments make this film a recommended watch in theatres this week. Its a patch above the ordinary, and will definitely leave you with palpation's.3.5/5* Grade: 74% B",7,0,3,11 March 2016
Skyfall," emotional Bond
","Went in with almost no expectations, and the film was relatively good. A bond that had emotions along with action. A well made thriller with bravo performances by Daniel Craig, and Javier Bardem.Films plot : In Istanbul, MI6 agents James Bond and Eve Moneypenny chase a mercenary, Patrice, who has stolen a computer hard drive containing details of undercover agents placed in terrorist organisations by NATO states. Patrice wounds Bond in the shoulder and, as the two men fight atop a train, Eve inadvertently shoots Bond, allowing Patrice to escape. Bond falls into a river and goes missing, presumed to be dead. In the aftermath of the operation, M, the head of MI6, comes under political pressure to retire from Gareth Mallory, the Intelligence and Security Committee Chairman. On her return from the meeting, MI6's servers are breached and M receives a taunting message via computer moments before the offices explode, killing a number of employees. MI6 relocates to its emergency offices underground. Bond, having used his supposed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to London. Although he fails a series of physical and psychological examinations, M approves his return to the field. Shrapnel taken from Bond's shoulder wound helps identify Patrice, and intelligence places him in Shanghai, where he is planning an assassination. Bond is ordered to identify Patrice's employer, recover the stolen hard drive and kill Patrice.",7,1,5,19 November 2013
Airlift," A patriotic cinematic gem, that has one of Akshay Kumar's best performances till date.
","Airlift is an amazing film and I like to state that in the beginning. Airlift evokes a sense of patriotism that is so real, and not gimmicky as we see with other Indian films. Here everything is extremely sharp, real, gritty and raw. One feels as they have been thrown into a war zone, its a very film authentic. Hence its a very brutal, and sometimes hard to stomach, but its exhilarating. We rarely (if ever) get to see a film like this made in India which is made on such a huge scale, and talks of a real story of how 1,70,000 Indians were stuck in Kuwait during the time Iraq and Saddam Hussain attacked Kuwait in 1990. Its of international standards. What ones sees in the film will leave you teary eyed, you will be left gasping, and finally all Indians will feel proud of Airlift. This film is a gem that should be watched by all Indians, it left me speechless because we rarely get to see good cinema nowadays but Airlift is what we categorize as a classic. The human emotions, the amazing camera work, the great visual effects, the thrilling screenplay, and above all the best acting I have seen in a film for awhile by Akshay Kumar. Akshay Kumar deserves a national award for this film, the man is the film, he has given his all to Airlift. His act has a goose bump arising affect.Story wise Ranjit Katyal is a shrewd businessman who liked enjoying the high society life of Kuwait. His wife Amrita Katyal is happy in her own world with her little daughter. Their world is turned upside down as Iraq invades Kuwait on August 2, 1990. Circumstances get the best or worst out of people. Ranjit who was a selfish businessman turns a new leaf as he watches his driver murdered in front of his own eyes. He along with a group of rich friends organizes a camp for 1, 70, 000 Indians. The subsequent days are a glorious account of his powerful negotiating skills with enemies as well as friends. Acting wise Airlift probably has one of the best ensembles seen in a Hindi film after a long time. Akshay Kumar like stated before is MINDBLOWING. He is completely restraint, but what he conveys in his eyes, is what you call acting. I cant single out one scene,but he is outstanding in the whole film. Give him all the Indian film awards he deserves them. Nimrat Kaur character is completely real and she stands out in her monologue just after the interval when Tipu Sultan the ship is sent back. She is at her fiery best in that speech.Kumud Mishra is a revelation,this mans relentless act will leave you in awe. Prakash Belawadi is first rate as the annoying, but eager helpless south Indian wanting to go back home. Purab Kohli is good. Inaamulhaq is the only miscast, and is a caricature of a Iraqi general, his accent was horrible.Airlift shows the true grim side of war, the stuff news channels don't want to cover, the reality of how thousands of Indians were left stranded in Kuwait during the 1990s in a oil war with Iraq. Within 24 hours all Indians rich or poor were left to beg on the streets, and Kuwaitis were being killed with no regard. When this is shown 15 min into the film, one knows an amazing film is coming and that Airlift shows all this in a extremely honest and true light. Nothing has been commercialized, or shown out of perspective. And thats the film biggest strength, being truthful, and not taking cinematic liberties. The film is gritty, raw, and real. Airlift is also very thrilling, and will leave you at the edge of your seat with your heat pounding at many instances. You cant move your eyes from the screen for even a second, its that gripping.The camera-work is amazing, and has shown war time Kuwait amazingly, everything just looks so real, and grim. The sets, the clothing, the cars, the production values in general are of international standards. The visual affects are first rate. The film has almost no negatives.The only thing that bothered me was the slow pace at times and the casting of Inaamulhaq as the general he was a complete miscast, and annoying. But were Airlift wins your heart is in the films true message of how brave India, and Indians are, we are responsible for the biggest evacuation in the history of the world. Its truly inspiring to think India actually airlifted 1, 70, 000 people out of a war zone. Its truly a bravo moment. The film is a classic piece of cinema for India. If America has saving private Ryan, Argo etc We have Airlift. We can proudly say that, thanks to Director Raja Menon who made such a inspiring true tale about India. He created such a huge canvas its truly applaud worthy. He made sure the film was of international standards in all aspects. The dialogues also standout especially my favourite ' Aadmi ki fitrat hi aisi hai Ibrahim,Jab chot lagti hai tab ma ma hi chillata hai.'That dialogue gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. The song tu bhoola jise is going to be the new Indian anthem, its a beautiful patriotic song. Finally the films biggest highlight is the last 20-30 min, and when you see the first flight take off, you will be left in tears. Once again bravo Mr. Akshay Kumar, what you did with this film, has made sure I am a fan forever.Finally I will not preach anymore just go watch Airlift this republic day, and do yourself a favor. Its a must watch for all Indians, not because its a film that will make you feel patriotic, because its a cinematic masterpiece. Vande Mataram!!!5/5* or 10/10",10,0,1,22 January 2016
Gravity," No James Cameron the film isn't that great its good though
","Gravity in 3D IMAX was a helluva ride!!! More than a film it was visual experience like never before. I felt like I was in outer space.LOL.Gravity is a simple story of how a girl survives in outer space.Sandra Bullocks killed the role,her most challenging and best role.Amazing job by team Gravity and the director its not easy making a film thats full of VFX and CGI, they made outer space look as real as possible.However the big minus in Gravity is the story, its very predictable, and its hinder the film from become one of the best films ever. Overall watch Gravity because its one best outer space movies you have seen till date and its a visual experience like never before!!!",7,0,1,19 November 2013
This Is the End," let your imagination go!!!
","This Is TheEnd is the most random,wacky zany,unpredictable comedy ever!Was epic,funniest movie I have seen in a while. And watching the backstreet boy cameo at the end was the cherry on the cake. films main plot: Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles to visit his old friend and fellow actor Seth Rogen, who invites Baruchel to attend a housewarming party hosted by James Franco. Baruchel is uncomfortable being around many people he does not know well, so Rogen accompanies him to a convenience store.

Baruchel tries to explain that the Rapture has occurred, but Rogen and the others dismiss this as a hallucinogenic episode. Later, the earth quakes again and they rush outside to see the Hollywood Hills on fire. A large crack opens in the earth swallowing up several other celebrities, while Rogen, Baruchel, Franco, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson survive. They take inventory of the supplies, including food, water, drugs, and James' revolver from Flyboys. They set up a ration system, fortify the house, and await help.",8,0,3,19 November 2013

Argo," Thrilling to the end
","The best suspense drama of the year. The films plot, and suspense takes hold of you right in the beginning of the film and that grip is there till the end credits. Not a big fan of Ben Affleck but he was alright here, but he has directed and made an amazing movie. Highly Recommend!!!!Films main plot : Iranian activists storm the United States embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, in retaliation for President Jimmy Carter giving the Shah asylum in the U.S. during the Iranian Revolution. More than 50 of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six escape and hide in the home of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor.

Tony Mendez, a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency exfiltration specialist is brought in for consultation.",9,1,3,19 November 2013
Creed," A great knockout boxing film,fans of the rocky series will be happy.
","I am not huge fan of boxing other than jumping on the Floyd Mayweather bandwagon for the last 5 years, and the Rocky series is not the same it used to be with the last couple of films being mediocre at best. So with Creed my expectation were literally zilch. Fortunately for me Creed was highly enjoyable, and way better than I excepted. It not only brings back the rocky series too life, but Stallone finally gets a role he can flourish in, and that suits him. While the film does take the predictable route, its still a highly inspirational, and motivating film. Michael Jordan most be applauded for the shape he got into for this film. Bravo. I must say this is one of the better sports films I have seen, but thats not saying a lot, because most of the sport films are full of clichés and bore me to death. However without giving any spoilers away let me tell you its not only Adonis Creed battling it out, so is Balboa but in a different way. Story wise Adonis Johnson never knew his famous father, boxing champion Apollo Creed, who died before Adonis was born. However, boxing is in his blood, so he seeks out Rocky Balboa and asks the retired champ to be his trainer. Rocky sees much of Apollo in Adonis, and agrees to mentor him, even as he battles an opponent deadlier than any in the ring. With Rocky's help, Adonis soon gets a title shot, but whether he has the true heart of a fighter remains to be seen.Acting wise Michael Jordan is just a few films old but the kid has dedication to make it big, the level of fitness he shows in this film is amazing. He has a bright future and is picking the right films, but his acting skills need to polished he is a bit raw. Sylvester Stallone in my opinion has given his best performance in the last 10 years, he is finally playing his age, and the emotional depth he brings to his role is commendable.Creed is pretty much a lead up to the films heart pounding climax. The climax is what makes the film notches above the ordinary. Its a standout sequence.The film also goes into the nitty gritty of boxing and is very technically sound. Watching the athletes go through the gruelling training was very motivational and inspiring. Creed had great emotional depth, and the two main leads were made to be very venerable, and that did wonders for the whole underdog, trying to get out of hid dads shadow angle in the film. The film's highlight for me though was when 2pac's Hail Mary was playing the background and Adonis was walking out for his final fight, that scene gave me goosebumps. The fighting choreography was amazing, and the boxing scenes were realistic as could be. Bravo for those scenes to the Dir Ryan Coogler . But the film at times was way too melo dramatic, and those scenes lead to same clichéd, predictability we see in every other sports film. And what was need for a love story in the film. However these are minor blemishes the film has, and they are more than made up by the cast performances, and exhilarating fights.Overall Creed is not only made for fans of boxing, or the Rocky series, it is just a good film in general, that the whole family can enjoy this holiday season. Its a clean film, that has got some very good boxing sequences and some top notch acting. 3.5/5* or 7/10",7,0,6,25 November 2015
Spotlight," A thought provoking film, about uncovering some hidden truths. 2015's best film till now, its realistic cinema at its best.
","Faith, religion is at times is the most powerful thing a person has, faith at times can regulate a persons whole life,some peoples whole life is just about god, and these people look up to certain god men, them being priests, popes etc but at many instances we see these men take advantage of there power and place, and do things that are unmentionable. Spotlight highlights these unmentionable acts that many churches were hiding to keep there dignity intact. I am not questioning any religion, but what these priests did in 2001 (and before and after that time) was absolutely sickening. Spotlight is based on a true of how priests across America but specifically the Boston area, tracing back to the the 1960s sexually assaulted children from the ages of 5-13. These Roman Catholic/Christian priests of Boston/America were supposed to spread the word of peace and goodness of the lord, but they took advantage of there power and did something unforgivable. Spotlight is one of those rare films that completely shocks you, makes you think, and leaves very uncomfortable. Spotlight is realistic cinema at its best, this is one of those most superior films I have seen this year, its a film that makes the viewers feel uncomfortable, mad, and in it will move you to tears. I don't have enough adjectives to explain Spotlights brilliance, it 2015's best film till now, and I have no doubt about this. The film has no flaw, the ensemble is brilliant, the films well researched, etc everything is superb. But its film you wish that was never made, because you wish these incidents in the film never occurred. But how long can the truth be hidden for. The film is very disturbing so watch with caution but it completely thought provoking.Story wise Under the direction of new editor Marty Baron , the Boston Globe's elite investigative team, Spotlight, is tasked with delving into decades worth of child abuse claims against the Catholic Church. Lead by Walter 'Robby' Robinson the journalists begin to uncover a massive network of sexual abuse and willful ignorance perpetrated by the Church within the city of Boston. Facing political opposition and resistance from the far-reaching influence of the Church, the reporters undertake an explosive exposé on the corrupt system. This year we have seen many great ensemble casts, but Spotlight has the best ensemble cast by far. Michael Keaton is simply amazing, he gets totally into character, and never acts a false note. His pre climax scene when his old buddy from college tells him to drop the case, and Keaton says Ill quote on what you said, is one of 2015's best sequences. Its a slap in the face. Mark Ruffalo, is a man on a mission in the film, and he steals the show in the film. His relentless act will get him an Oscar nominee for sure.Rachel McAdams gets one of her most acting orientated roles, and she is superb.Lev Schreiber character is a silent one, but when he speaks, he is the most powerful person on screen.Brian d'Arcy James underplays his role superbly.There a couple of things that I will take back from Spotlight, that will continue to disturb me for awhile, its rare that a film affects me so such that it haunts my thoughts for so long. I just can't understand how so many churches that spread across the world, would let priests sexually assault children, for centuries, CENTURIES!!! It's absolutely sickening, how Church Leader's tried to hid these sins, by using there power influence, money, and by using the name of the lord. And then these used churches to make money off, by helping them get off cases. Did any of these people have a soul.Thoughts like these keep wandering in my mind. The film leaves you with a eerie feeling that you just can't let go of for awhile. Nevertheless Spotlight is complete brilliance. The films story and screenplay are superb. The film is not glamorized at all, the film is very gritty and real. Its a film based on real, and true facts. Its realistic cinema at its best. The films location, settings, etc are top notch, and nothing feels out of place for 2001. The film has no blemishes at all. The film is a investigative thriller, and it works in all accounts. You are at the edge of your set the whole time, and by the end of the film you are rotund for the Spotlight team. The films highlight is in its superb performances for its ensemble, and being so superbly informative, and so accurate in every aspect of how law works, how the investigation took place.Overall Spotlight will sweep the Oscars this year because there is no film that stands a chance next to this classic. Its a film which I could call one of my favourites, but I don't know if I want to watch it again, because the stories of those innocent children still haunt me.5/5* or 10/10",10,3,7,18 November 2015
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Mindblown, i have to go for run now!!!
","The film is about the story of Milkha Singh the great Indian runner, soldier, and hero. The film evokes patriotism like never before, a masterpiece... Farhan Akhtar as the flying Sikh has not only given a career best, its probably best performance seen years he was Milkha Singh, he better get ready for all the awards. Divya Dutta, Pawan Malhotra, Yograj Singh, and Prakash Raj also give superb performances all were MINBLOWING!!! Dir ROPM has given his career best film and that saying a lot for the RDB maker, he gave the film his heart and soul, take a bow sir. Overall this is a film not only Indians should see but the whole world needs to experience the heroic life of living legend the flying Sikh MILKHA SINGH!!!",10,0,0,19 November 2013
Black Mass," Black Mass is a gritty, dark, biopic on one of the most notorious gangster to ever live,James 'Whitey' Bulger. Depp is back with a Oscar worthy act!
","I would lie if I said I didn't have huge expectations from a film like Black Mass, the trailer was outstanding, the films cast boasts of actors like Johnny Depp,Joel Edgerton,Benedict Cumberbatch, and Kevin Bacon.The film had everything going for it, it was a masterpiece in the making. And did Black Mass ever meet those expectations,I mean don't get me wrong the film probably is not a masterpiece, but its easily one of the finest films, you will see this year. From the word go a dark eerie atmosphere is created in the film, and its maintained throughout. James 'Whitey' Bulger easily becomes that one character you hate to love, and its all thanks to Johnny Depp's Oscar worthy performance, he has made a comeback like never before after many flop films, his performance alone is worth the ticket price of the film. I mean Black Mass is not as good but can easily be compared too gangster flicks like the Departed,Goodfellas made by Ace filmmaker Martin Scorsese, and thats saying a lot because those films are masterpieces, decade defining films. Black Mass is a gritty, dark, biopic on one of the most notorious gangster to ever live,James 'Whitey' Bulger.Story wise the film is a biopic on the rise and fall of the Irish mob boss James 'Whitey' Bulger, better know as Jimmy.Jimmy was involved in almost any criminal activity a person could name, from money laundering, to racketeering,murder, extortion,trafficking drugs, terrorism,etc you name it. The film starts off with members of his Irish mob, the main members turning informants and telling the story of how Jimmy became such a big gangster when at one point he was a nobody. The film talks about how Jimmy's younger brother Billy was a state Senator, a very affluent person in the southern Boston area. An area which Jimmy wanted under his control but the Italian mob was in his way. After a series of events Jimmy is introduced to James Connolly a former childhood friend, now turned FBI agent. He makes a deal with Jimmy that he can continue doing whatever he does, if he provides info on how to arrest the Italian mob, Jimmy looks at this to his advantage, and doesn't consider this snitching because he would not be ratting out anybody he is associated with. This deal somehow leads to James 'Whitey' Bulger becoming the biggest gangster in America in the 70s, and 80s, and it also lead to him being on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list, how this happened is what forms the rest of the films story.Acting wise, as I stated before Johnny Depp has given a Oscar worthy performance in Black Mass, as James 'Whitey' Bulger. He plays the dark character so menacingly, that at times you feel that Johnny is actual Whitey, and thats the highest praise any actor can get. Depp has hit it out of the ball park. On the other hand Joel Edgerton is on a roll with great performances, after the Gift, he has given another amazing act. Benedict Cumberbatch is good in his brief appearance. The rest of the ensemble cast is apt.Black Mass is a film that doesn't have any huge negatives,I mean you could look at the films pace and say that its slow, but for this type of film you need that type of pace, the screenplay could have been a little more novel, because at times, it does feel like the film is taking the route most gangster films do, but I mean as I mentioned on the onset the film is no masterpiece. However the director Scott Copper needs to applauded for getting the atmosphere right in the film, and never wavering away from the films true story. Nothing is glamorized in the film,Black Mass feels like a real, gritty drama.Overall I won't say much more other than if you want to see one of the years best films,head to a theater near you because Johnny Depp's performance alone is worth the ticket price the rest is a bonus in Black Mass. A must watch for people who enjoy films about the Mob and gangster flicks.4/5* or 8.5/10",8,3,10,18 September 2015
Life of Pi," Mastery
","An amazing visual spectacle. A film made to see in 3D. A gripping tale of boy stranded in the sea with a tiger for 277 days, and how his belief in god becomes either stronger or whether's away. My personal most favorite film of the year, a must watch film, just do not miss it!!!!Films main plot: Pi is raised a Hindu who practices vegetarianism. As a fourteen-year-old he investigates Christianity and Islam and decides to become an adherent of all three religions, saying he 'just wants to love God.'[10][11] He tries to understand God through the lens of each religion and comes to recognize benefits in each one. Shifting government policies lead to a decision by Pi's father to sell the zoo and emigrate with his wife and two sons to Canada. The second part of the novel begins with Pi's family aboard the Tsimtsum, the Japanese freighter that is transporting animals from their zoo to North America. A few days out of port from Manila, the ship encounters a storm and sinks. Pi manages to escape in a small lifeboat, only to learn that the boat also holds a spotted hyena, an injured Grant's zebra, and an orangutan. To Pi's distress, the hyena soon kills the zebra and then the orangutan. At this point Pi learns that a 450-pound Bengal tiger has been hiding under the boat's tarpaulin: Richard Parker, who had boarded the lifeboat with ambivalent assistance from Pi himself. The tiger kills and eats the hyena. Frightened, Pi constructs a small raft out of rescue flotation devices, tethers it to the stern of the boat and retreats to it. He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer and seasickness as a punishment mechanism while using a whistle for signals. Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal and is eventually able to share the boat with Richard Parker. Pi recounts various events while adrift in the Pacific Ocean. At his lowest point, exposure renders him blind, feeble and unable to catch fish. In a state of delirium he talks with a marine 'echo' that he eventually identifies as Richard Parker finally speaking up, then identifies as another survivor on another lifeboat who is also blinded by exposure and dying. They share dreams of food. The other voice speaks with a French accent and prefers meat to the vegetarian fare Pi longs for. Pi welcomes this 'brother' aboard his boat. The other person moves to attack and eat Pi but is instead devoured by Richard Parker, who springs out at him from under the tarpaulin. Later, his sight restored, Pi's boat comes ashore on a floating island network of algae and inhabited by meerkats. Pi gains strength but his discovery that the island's plant life is carnivorous forces him to return to the boat. Two hundred and twenty-seven days after the ship's sinking, the lifeboat washes onto a beach in Mexico. Richard Parker disappears into the nearby jungle without a glance back. The third part of the novel describes a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck. They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering. Pi tells them his tale but the officials reject it as unbelievable. Pi then offers them a second story in which he is adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals, but with the ship's cook, a Taiwanese sailor with a broken leg, and his own mother. The cook amputates the sailor's leg for use as fishing bait, then kills the sailor and Pi's mother for food. Pi then kills the cook and dines on him. The officials note parallels between the two stories and conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi's mother, and the tiger Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proved and neither explains the cause of the shipwreck. He asks the officials which story they prefer. They choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says 'And so it goes with God.'",10,0,2,19 November 2013
Pacific Rim," this beats transformers by miles
","Pacific Rim is Transformers on steroids, meets Godzillas father who is far more superior. The film has Action that has never before seen its MINBLOWING!!! The film is a visual mastery... The film is a slow and clichéd in parts, but this film is pure cinematic entertainment so you forget the few hiccups. The films story is about how how monster called kiagges come from the bottom of the ocean and are destroying the world. Humans than create jaggars, robot machines to combat the monsters. Overall it a must watch for all who love action and sci fi films!!! Also i recommend you watch the film in 3D because the film is way more appealing when you feel like you are in the battle ;)",8,8,12,19 November 2013
Ant-Man," Great Innovative fun, if only the story was more novel than the staple good vs bad... Oh well
","Now I know Antman is an original Marvel comic, but I really believe that when it comes to the movie it must be inspired a bit by the highly successful Telugu, Tamil and Hindi Bi- Lingual film Eega,but thats a discussion for another day. Antman as a stand alone film, when being compared to some other superhero ultra budget high tech films like Avengers, Captain America etc is a rather smaller film in scale but Antman does impress.Though like many other super hero films Antman also has staple story of good vs bad, and most of the film you can predict miles away,but the films innovative action and comedy make it a very entertaining watch. Watching the Antman fight people much larger, is as fun and innovate as you could think. Director Peyton Reed pulls out all stops to make the proceeding very entertaining. The climax deserves extra marks for being full of great action and comedy at the same time.Acting wise Paul Rudd surprises big time, as the Antman as he suits the role and excels. I mean a very mediocre actor at best has probably got the role of a life time.Overall Antman exceeded my expectations as i wasn't excepting much but i actually enjoyed this more than the last avengers, now if only the story was more novel.3.5/5* or 7/10",7,0,6,17 July 2015
American Hustle," Best ensemble cast EVER?
","Multi layered crime film; American Hustle is a brilliantly directed picture with a terrific cast of varied talent that really makes the film standout. Helmed by director David O. Russell, who previously directed Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter, both of them were standout films, but with this outing, Russell has made the finest film of his career. The story is not new, but what makes it standout is the cast, its chemistry and layered plot that manages to be very entertaining despite the fact that we've seen similar ideas before. The film is well executed and its cast are truly engaging. For me, anyhow there is not one bad performance here, and each actor just elevates the film that much more. The idea is simple, but the way Russell and company craft this film is what makes American Hustle a memorable and engaging ride from start to finish. With that being said, American Hustle will most likely be seen as a modern crime classic in the future. Like I said, this is David O. Russell's finest work yet, and with a cast like this, American Hustle is a must see picture that you won't want to miss. Brilliantly acted and directed, this picture is one of those films that soars above the rest while using a simple, yet well layered plot to create something truly memorable. Russell truly shines here, and saying that, I wonder how he will top this outstanding crime drama. If you love Crime films, American Hustle is a no brainer to watch. The film echoes of the finest films of the genre, And with a stunning cast of phenomenal talent, this film definitely stands out, and is one of the finest films of the year.",8,1,5,8 January 2014

Acting wise both leads gave amazing performances, them being Dainel Bruhl and Chris Hemsworth.A must watch for the amazing cinematic experience, and you don't wanna miss one best films of the year.",9,2,3,19 November 2013
Bridge of Spies," A true story about an American lawyer trying to uphold, true American values during the cold war. Another masterpiece by Spielberg, and one of the years best films!!!
","Every life matters, we see Tom Hanks character, James Donovan repeat this dialogue again, and again, and not till the tear dropping climax do we realize why he says this. Bridge of Spies is probably my personal favorite film of the year, The combo of Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have made another masterpiece, this being there fourth collaboration. Both create an absolutely moving,inspiring, and tear jerking film. Spielberg is just pure genius, he is like a gift from the film gods, and Hanks gives another Oscar worthy act. Spielberg with the Bridge of Spies, promotes American nationalism, and pride in a very worthy way, he doesn't spread propaganda that we see in films like American sniper. He shows, that all American lives matter, that a man who upholds the American constitution for ever person whether they be a spy or not is the real American hero. One who follows orders like a robot is not always correct aka CIA agents. Spielberg also shows how American children where feed false fear mongering information/propaganda to instill fear for a enemy who wasn't there, they just wanted to make American Nationalists. But more on that later. In short Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks get ready for the Oscars.Story wise the film is about an Insurance lawyer based in Brooklyn New York named James Donavan, who is given a criminal case after years to defend a soviet spy during the cold war between the US and the USSR. The case is a open and shut one, the American government is ready to hang the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, but James is not going to let that happen, he wants to defend his client properly by upholding the American constitution.Even though he is found guilty in all counts of the charges against him, James somehow negotiates with the Judge to give him life in jail, and not the death sentence. While the CIA follows James for info on Abel, he goes to Supreme Court to get a retrial, he fails but a opportunity comes out nowhere. The soviets have captured a American pilot, Gary Powers who was spying in Soviet skies for the CIA and they want exchange him for Abel. The CIA send James to negotiate the deal in Germany (no mans land), where a civil war in ensuing. What happens next is what forms the rest of the plot.Acting wise Tom Hanks is at it again with another masterful act, he makes the character his own, and leaves you in awe. The climax scene when he is watching Abel getting shoved in the back seat of a Soviet car, is pure genius and evokes tears. Mark Rylance is brilliant as the Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel. The rest of the cast are good in there respected roles.Bridge of the Spies is based on a true story, and Spielberg makes sure he tells the story as true as possible. He shows the good, bad and ugly side of America during the cold war, the film has no biases at all. He shows a man upholding the American constitution for an Soviet Spy, and he also shows how American children were feed false info to be made American Nationalistic robots. He showed how the CIA had there own agenda, and didn't necessarily care about American lives. The American stance against Germany during the Berlin Wall (East and West Germany)is also shown .In short Spielberg has got his facts almost 100% correct. And in a film like this that is of utmost importance. He doesn't take his audience for granted. He instead shows a powerful, moving drama, about one man trying to save American lives during the cold war. At many instance Bridge of Spies will leave you laughing,stunned, and in the climax you will be moved in tears. The films is an emotional journey of a true American hero James B. Donavan, who went from the most hated man in the USA, to an American hero. He is an American hero, and even I salute you good sir. This is the one of the most accurate, and positive films made on American history. The film is technically sound, its shot beautifully through America, and Germany in the 60s era, and the BGM is excellent. Kudos to the Cohen brothers for writing a brilliant screenplay and script. For me the film has no blemishes, but viewers may be for warned Bridge Of Spies is no flashy, no brainier entertainer, its a film made for a mature audience, who relish good cinema.Overall Bridge of Spies is nothing short of a masterpiece, Spielberg does it again and his resume and Oscars speak for themselves, but he proves his worth again, with this moving tale. In short if you want to see one of the years best films, don't wait,run to the theaters.4.5/5* or 9.3/10",9,3,8,16 October 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Some kickASS fun, mission accomplished!!!
","Could i have just watched the best Mission Impossible today? Well maybe, but one thing is for sure MI4 is a damn fun film. The action is top notch, and will leave you in awe. Especially the water tanker scene, and the car/motorcycle chase scene,don't miss those scenes. And the locations are breathtaking, you will see Morocco,Cuba,London etc like never before .The production values are top notch. But does film have a good story, well lets observe.Story wise the film is pretty much about a rouge syndicate, doing terror acts across the world. On the other side the IMF has been abolished by the USA government, and the main character Ethan Hunt aka Tom Cruise is now a rouge agent which the CIA want too arrest. Ethan Hunt though has other plans, and tries to elude the CIA. He wants to find out who is running the syndicate, and wants to destroy it. That is pretty much the main plot and to find out if he does, rush to the theatres.As you could you tell the story is not very novel but its told in a fresh narrative, but when watching a MI film, you don't look for cinematic genius, you look for some kickass fun, and thats what you get. A sleek,espionage spy action adventure.And plus its so fun to watch the cast of IMF back again, the characters, and there chemistry is impeccable.Acting wise Tom Cruise lives the MI films, his action scenes are simply amazing. Simon Pegg is hilarious, and his chemistry with Cruise is impeccable.Rebecca Ferguson,Jeremy Renner, and Alec Bladwin are all good in there brief roles.Overall if your looking for some kickass fun and if your a fan of the MI films this film is a must watch.The films narrative is fast and never bores. 3.5/5* or 7/10",7,2,5,31 July 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," Ron Woodroff VS FDA
","Dallas Buyers Club is a compelling and stunning watch. The films main plot has to with the world of AIDS and HIV in the 80s. Ron Woodroff gets infected with HIV, and is told he has 30 days to live, he then takes things into his own hands and goes to Mexico. In Mexico he gets introduced to new drugs that help with HIV and AIDS but they are not FDA approved. Here starts the battle of Woodroff VS the FDA. He starts his own club where he treats people with AIDS and HIV, thats the main plot. Acting wise Matthew Mconganuey gives his career best performance, he lost almost 100 pounds for his role, and he stuns with such a mature and spellbinding performance. But Jared Leto steals the show, he touches new heights with DBC, his performance is award worthy. The films minuses are the slow pace and excessive length.Overall this film is path breaking because the subject of AIDS has not been talked about much in films, its a must watch for all cinema lovers.",8,16,23,19 November 2013
Now You See Me," It could not climax properly
","A entertaining film,with a half baked story,with okay twists,and a slow pace.Story about magicians robing banks Etc for a reason.Jesse Eisenberg,Morgan Freeman,and Michael Caine impress with there amazing act skills in Now You See Me ,they almost make the movie above average. Where the film really falter is in the climax. I will not reveal the climax but its done very amateurishly, and half baked. It almost ruins the whole film Overall a good watch if you don't have too man expectations. Average watch, watch on one of those rain boring days, because its okay films but its avoidable. If only the film could climax.....",6,2,3,19 November 2013
Legend," An average gangster flick, with Tom hardy giving his career best act.
","I didn't know much about the Cray brothers Reggie and Ron before watching Legend, and even after watching the film I kind of feel I still don't know too much about them. Though the film was a biopic of sorts of the twin gangster brothers, who ruled London in the 1960s, the film was very confused in its plot. Like was Legend a gangster flick or a love story? The trailer of the film in my opinion doesn't portray the film properly, because people like me going into theaters to watch a film on the 1960s London mafia and except a decent amount of action thrill etc in the film will come out a bit underwhelmed. However this real life inspired film did still have a lot of great moments, mostly thanks to Tom Hardy's career best act, but the film also had faults, but more on that later.Story wise suave,charming and volatile, Reggie Kray and his unstable twin brother Ronnie start to leave their mark on the London underworld in the 1960s. Using violence to get what they want, the siblings orchestrate robberies and murders while running nightclubs and protection rackets. With police Detective Leonard 'Nipper' Read hot on their heels, the brothers continue their rapid rise to power and achieve tabloid notoriety.Acting wise Tom Hardy puts his heart in the double role of Cray brothers Reggie and Ronnie. As Ronnie he plays the very complex schizophrenic cray brother who is completely out of control, and in this role Hardy shows great histrionics. As Reggie Hardy plays more of sober, and straightforward gangster who has more brains, and also dabbles in a love life. Hardy must be applauded for making both characters so different, and when both brothers are together on screen you can't tell there both the same actor. And that tells you the greatness of his act.Don't be surprised if Hardy gets a Oscar nominee or even wins best actor, he was that good, its his career best act.The biggest problem in Legend was the muddled,story and screenplay. For example we are not given any back story of how these brothers became gangsters, how they came up in the ranks, we are just shown them already being made men who just rise higher. The plot also gives Reggie's love story too much importance, half the film almost deals with his love story, and though some of those scenes are good, it takes away from being a gangster biopic. The Director seemed like he was confused which genre he wanted to portray more. The films pace was also snail like, and by the end of the film it feels like this 2hr film was more like 3 hrs long. However the film does have Tom Hardy to make up for a lot of the films flaws, he delivers a superb, electrifying act, and whenever his character Ronnie is on screen he makes every scene light up with his literally crazy antics.Watch out for the scene when Ronnie admits he is gay, and the scene were he hammers people to pulp in the bar fight scene these scenes are extremely entertaining. As Reggie his pre climax scene when he stabs a man to death is a highlight. The films clothing's,the cars, the sets, etc were all pitch perfect. The production values were top notch. The films background score was the best I heard for any Hollywood film this year. The film dialogues deserve applause, they were really fiery and impactful.The films action was okay. There are a couple of gory scenes, but thats standard in a movie about gangsters. Overall if your a fan of Tom Hardy, or if your intrigued by the Cray brothers story you can give Legend a watch, its a decent film about the London mafia in the 1960s, but there is a lot still left to be desired in this story. For many they could wait for the film to release on DVD.3/5* or 6/10",6,1,4,4 December 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Sometimes taking a risk is all one needs to do to find ones self...
","Stiller and screenwriter Steve Conrad based the film, just a little bit, on the short story by James Thurber about a man prone to elaborate daydreams. He uses that story as a springboard to something altogether new, and surprisingly intimate. This is essentially a $90 million art film that maintains a nice indie sensibility to go with its moments of grand spectacle.Stiller, in one of his best performances, plays the title character, an introverted man holding down a job handling photo negatives for Life magazine. After a vivid daydream where he saves a cat from a building moments before it explodes, he wanders into Life's lobby late, and finds out the magazine will be ceasing publication and going to an online format (Incidentally, this already happened a long time ago in the real world. Life has been special-issue-only for years, and doesn't even exist as its own full website anymore.)So Walter, in the digital age, is quickly becoming an unnecessary entity at his job. To add insult to injury, he's getting harassed by Ted (a sinisterly funny Adam Scott), the super douche tasked with transitioning the magazine to an online format. Ted mocks him in front of fellow employees and throws paper clips as Walter daydreams about co-worker Cheryl (a sweetly charming Kristen Wiig) by the office coffee machine.Walter imagines epic battles with Ted involving their blasting out of the side of the office building and ultimately concrete surfing on the streets of New York City—all while battling over a Stretch Armstrong doll.Crisis looms when a negative from star photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn), the negative meant for the magazine's final cover, goes missing. Walter, with help from Cheryl, springs into action on a quest to find the negative that leads him through Greenland, Iceland, Afghanistan and the Himalayas. Along the way, he reignites former passions, like skateboarding and hiking, and those daydreams become more and more unnecessary.This movie qualifies as a nice love letter to Kristen Wiig, who represents possibly the coolest love interest on screen this past year. Her Cheryl has a nice accessibility to go along with her beauty and humor, and it's no wonder Walter has a crush. Stiller and Wiig have a genuine chemistry together, with Wiig's performance completely absent of her more zany comic tendencies.Penn is downright incredible in his one scene, of which I will give away no details. Patton Oswalt shines as an eHarmony consultant so friendly he could only be found in a movie. Shirley MacLaine is mighty convincing as Walter's mom, no easy feat considering that many of us are aware that Stiller's mom is Anne Meara.There's nothing forced in Stiller's depiction of Walter coming out of his shell, and nothing jarring about the transition. As we learn some of the reasons Walter lapsed into a life of daydreaming rather than dream fulfillment, Walter becomes a complete character rather than that fleeting representation in Thurber's story.Stiller's performance goes between subtle and extremes, with most of those extremes happening in the daydreams. In the quieter moments, it's the sort of well-modulated performance that ranks with his work in The Royal Tenenbaums and Flirting with Disaster. He's also a pretty good skateboarder (that's him riding at quite high speeds down a mountain road in Iceland).Cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh deserves major kudos for his always stunning work here, whether his lens is on Stiller in an elevator or Stiller jumping into a stormy Atlantic Ocean. Also notable is the soundtrack, with a roster of artists like David Bowie, Of Monsters and Men, and Arcade Fire that truly bolsters the viewing experience.The message that Stiller delivers with his film is an obvious one: Many of our daydreams are just a hop, skip and skateboard away from being realities. With a simple message elegantly and majestically portrayed, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty winds up being one of 2013's best movie",9,0,3,9 January 2014
Prisoners," Best film of year so far...
","Prisoners is the reason why i love films so much... Its the best film i have seen this year so far, one of best crime/suspense thrillers i have ever seen. Hugh Jackman gives the best performance of the year, his career best same can be said for Jake Gyllenhall. Films story is about how two young girls are kidnapped what both families do,what the cops do, what mystery's unravel form the crux of the story. Not enough words to explain the brilliance of the film, this film falls into the genre of film like silence of lambs and zodiac, like those films prisoners has some scenes which may be hard to digest, and gruesome. But overall its A MUST WATCH FOR ALL!!!!",10,6,11,19 November 2013
Everest," A visually stunning film, but Everest has it's flaws.What could have been a epic film is still a great watch.
","The first thing that struck me in Everest was the films huge grandeur which was evident when one watches the trailer, and having a star cast which consists of Jake Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin,Keira Knightley, is also a huge plus. However what the film ends up being in the end is what I call a 'spectacular mess'. Spectacular because the film has some of the best visuals I have ever seen on screen, whether it be the 3D or not, Mount Everest just looks so beautiful, at times one feels like that there actually at Everest. The films sound quality is also superb, I watching the film in a normal theatre, but it felt like I was seating in a IMAX theatre. However I call the film a mess because Everest being a human drama, at times has almost no emotional connect with the chrarcters,we hardly know anything about them excluding one or two characters, and the film has way too many characters to follow which gets confusing at times, but more on the positives and negatives later.Story wise the film is about climbing the most deadly (read hardest)mountain ever created,Mount Everest. Many have climbed and succeed but 1 in 4 people who climb Mount Everest end up dying on the way. Everest was just not made to conquer. Everest therefore narrates the true story of how a man named Rob Hall, and Scott Fischer together tried to take there two groups of climbers to the top of Mount Everest and back. Rob we know had a wife, and a baby girl on the way. This expedition took place in 1996. Many groups from different countries tried to climb Mount Everest around the same time, but the film follows these two groups, because they were the only ones to make to the top successful. However when the groups starting coming down, a horrible storm hit them, how they handle the storm is what makes up the rest of the plot.Acting wise from the whole plethora of actors only a couple make a impact in there act.The first being Jason Clarke who is in fine form,he wins your heart in the films 2nd half when he wouldn't leave Doug by himself, an amazing job.Josh Brolin is superb as Beck, and ones feels like clapping when he wakes up in the pre climax. Jake Gyllenhaal has a smaller role compared too the others actors, but he leaves a major impact, and performs well.With a film like Everest one needs to feel for the characters, and for the most part thats not there, and with so many characters running around the film can get a little confusing at times. Also at the same time when Everest turns into a suspenseful film in the 2nd hour, one isn't clutching his seat enough, or feeling enough tension for a film of this calibre. But let me be brutally honest even though Everest is plagued with issues the film still succeeds in being a good film, I say this because I was cheering whenever a person made it safely to base camp from Everest. One feels like there watching hero's on screen. And like i mentioned earlier the film is made on lavish scale, the visuals, the sound, is some of the best I have seen in a film ever. You will be in awe of Mount Everest's beauty.Overall all blemishes withstanding, I highly recommend you watch Everest because you have probably never seen a film so visually beautifully before, and most importantly the film talks about a true story of real life hero's who lost there lives while climbing Mount Everest, watch it for them to know there story.I going with a very very nice 3.5/5* or 7/10",7,0,0,25 September 2015
Sicario," This US vs the Mexican cartel action thriller, is one of the best films of the year.
","Have you ever wondered how people like Osama Bin Laden or El Chapo come to power, and become gang lords, and then are killed/arrested at a timely convince. Well Sicario has a theory of all things mentioned above, one may say its a conspiracy theory etc but like they say there is no smoke without a fire.But all withstanding, what I saw on screen felt like a true story, and it was thought provoking. Sicario is a dark, and eerie tale about what happens just a couple miles away from the American border in Mexico. Daily many innocents Mexicans die due to the cartel drug war. And Sicario highlights the cruel killings, and how one needs to combat the drug lords. Rarely do you see a film that from the first frame not only does it engage you but it takes you into the nail biting action which is happening on screen.Numerous times I had my heart pounding, and jaw on the ground from action and suspense unfolding on the screen. Simply put Sicario has the best performances, and dialogues I have seen in a film this year. Film of the year? Well its in contention for sure.Story wise the film talks about the escalating drug war the Cartel are engaging in on American soil. After FBI agent Kate Macer invades a house in Arizona and finds about 40 dead bodies which are collateral from the Cartel drug war, she is recruited by the a government agency to take down the real players of the drug war. This agency is lead by two men Matt Graver, and Alejandro a columbian man. These two men target Manuel Diaz because he can lead them to the kingpin of the cartel because he is right hand man of the kingpin( Diaz lives in the USA, and fronts as a business man). After arresting Diaz's brother Guillermo on Mexico soil in a operation, he leads them to a tunnel used to transport drugs from Mexico to the US.How this tunnel leads to Manuel, and his boss is what forms the rest of the plot.Acting wise Benicio Del Toro is just mindblowing good, I thought Johnny Depp for Black Mass was the best performance of the year, but Del Toro gives him a good match. A Oscar worthy performance for sure. Josh Brolin is superb. And Emily Blunt is fantastic, she shoulders the film at many junctions.Its difficult to find any negatives in Sicario, because even the smallest details have been dealt with beautifully. The films pacing is a bit slow, but the concluding 30-45 are adrenal pumping no stop thrill and action, so that makes up for any pacing issues. Sicario being such a great film has many positives them being the dialouges, especially the ones mouthes by Del Toro,two dialogues in particular where 'time to meet god', and 'the wolves are taking over, and you wont be able to live with wolves so leave'(in the context of the film, there are mind blowing). Secondly the films acting which i mentioned above. Finally the film is the definition of what a perfect action thriller must be, the film is extremely detailed, its has a dark atmosphere, the way the film highlights the cartel violence, and how the Americans have a hand in the drug trade, is also handled perfectly. In short in Sicario content is king, and the script and screenplay are amazing. A special mention for the absolute amazing pre-climax sequence, i got my tickets worth in just those final minutes.Overall over the years Denis Villenue has become one of my favourite directors, and with Sicario he only solidifies his title. The film is a must watch, because if you don't watch it now, you will after seeing its Oscar nomination list because its just that good.4.5/5* or 9/10",9,1,4,2 October 2015
The Witch," A well made art-house horror film, that wont be relished by fans of escapist cinema.
","Let me state on the onset that The Witch carries a beware tag, for most people going into this film excepting a full blown horror film, that offers cheap thrills like the regular released Hollywood horror films ex. Saw or Paranormal Activity you will be disappointed.The Witch offers more of an art-house film with the films setting being horrorish. The Witch is a niche film made for people who relish artistic cinema, its not really made for the regular cinema going audience who indulge in escapist cinema. The film has certain milieu, that caught my attention right away, I was sucked into 1600's New England. The clothing, the way the people talked with heavy accents, the houses made of wood/hay, the farms filled with animals, everything was genuine and authentic of those times. The films attention to detail was something to marvel at, the cinematography was impeccable, it helped create the eerie dark feeling the film had from the first frame. But the film has its flaws but more on that later.Story wise in the 16th century, the deeply religious William leaves a New England plantation alongside his family (wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and twins Mercy and Jonas) due to a disagreement of beliefs. After a day's travel, the family finds a spot of land to start their new life. Several months later, the family has built a house and farm on the land and Katherine has given birth to her fifth child, Samuel. Thomasin looks after the infant Samuel one day but, while Thomasin is playing peek-a-boo with him, Samuel is abducted by a witch who lives in the surrounding forest. What happens next forms the crux of the film.Acting wise the cast was full of newcomers/ newer(unknown actors) actors who performed exceeding well. Anya-Taylor Joy has a cute innocence about her which she conveys well on screen, but when the dust settles especially in the climax/pre climax she turns too the dark side and shows her devilish side well. Ralph Ineson shows a helpless side of himself as a father stuck between his family and religion, he is great. Katie Dickie is schizophrenic on screen as the mother who cant cope with the loss of her child and turns semi-crazy. The younger kids have more of a comical role, and provide some nice light moments.The most important part of The Witch is the films whole aura, which is pitch perfect. Like I stated before the 1600s is perfectly depicted. The whole family being extremely religious is spot on for those times. The films director Robert Eggers makes sure that the audience has been encapsulated back in time. With the extraordinary camera-work the whole dark eerie, unsettling theme is fleshed out well. I must say I have never really seen a horror film like The Witch before, were most of horror comes through the silences, and from a artistic landscape, its a film that makes the mind think . There is no gimmicky fake cheap thrills, there is some gore, but its rather justified, and not overdone. The music creates a big impact on the film, and creates a tension filled screen. This film is more about creating a dark atmosphere, rather than trying to scare the audience. Which can be a bad thing or a good thing, here its a mix both. The films pace is very sluggish and a 1hr 30 min films feels more like 2hr + plus film. The Witch sometimes is to art-house for my liking, and more thrills were needed to keep the audience engaged, as I could see audience members getting tireless while watching this film. Finally The Witch is at its best in the films last 30 min when all hell breaks loose , and the scene when the brother has a exorcism of sorts, and when the sister heads to jungle with a black goat are the films highlight.Overall as I could gauge from the audience I was watching The Witch with, this film is not everyones cup of tea. The Witch is for more of a niche audience, who enjoy all types of cinema, and hone films as a artistic form, more than just escapist entertainment. Its a Sundance winner, and I can see why, there's a lot to love here, and I throughly enjoyed myself, but I feel bad for the audience going in excepting a full blown horror film, the film is misleading. Watch at your on caution you have been warned.3.5/5* or 7/10",7,0,4,19 February 2016
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs is a inspiring and moving tale, about the growth of a man and his company, that is told through 3 acts.
","Steven Jobs is the man who created a technological revolution, he created the device I am using to write this review, and I can almost bet that whatever device you are using too read this review is a Apple device created by Jobs. He has changed peoples lives forever, because think about it how long do spend on your iPhones,iPads, and MacBooks a day. To put it simply a lot, and therefore watching a film based on his life was very intriguing to say the least.But the film is not based on his life, the trailers, the films title eludes the viewer, instead the film is set in thee acts like a play would be,in which we get to see the growth of Apple, from failure to the heights of success. Danny Boyle, and Aaron Sorkin take a gamble that pays off, people excepted a full blown biopic, they wanted the ins and out of his life, they wanted to know how Apple was created etc. But instead we are given a insight of how Jobs and his key members of Apple grew with the failure and eventually success of Apple.The film does not get into the nitty gritty stuff, instead it talks only about Jobs's dream of making Apple into a successful path breaking company. Its was also interesting to know that Jobs was not the absolute amazing human being we thought he was, but more on that later.Steve Jobs is told in three acts, in which we see the growth of Steve Jobs, and Apple. The first act is set in 1984 when Jobs introduces the MacIntosh a new apple product.The second act is set in 1988, when Jobs has been fired by Apple and is set to launch his new company computer Next. The final act is when Jobs launches the iMac, in 1998, after he returns to Apple.Acting wise we see one of the best ensemble casts of the year in Steve Jobs.Micheal Fassbender is Steve Jobs, not for second do you think he is enacting a part, and he leaves you in awe with his dedication to the role.Kate Winslet is electrifying as Jobs's assistant, in the third act when she is yelling at Jobs she completely takes charge of the film.Seth Rogen underplays his role to perfection. and his final argument with Jobs in the third act after he walks away with superb panache, that scene defines his act. Jeff Daniels is superb, and at times overshadows the whole cast.Steve Jobs is almost like a experimental film, with the way its presented in three acts, and with its long scenes, its something you have never on the screen before. Its almost like a theater play. And for a lot of viewers this experiment might not work, people come excepting a biopic with a lot insight into apple and Jobs. But the film instead jam packs everything into the three acts, and there a lot under currents which the viewers has to pick up, they are not spoon feed information. However Steve Jobs works because of the reason why many may stay away from the film, the three act experiment for me was really refreshing, and the way we got the the growth of Jobs through these act was completely inspiring, and different. The tension filled launches were very entertaining to see, it was almost as the viewer was there in every big move Apple made.It was also nice to see that they showed the really Jobs in his many honest shades, because obviously we know he is a great man, but we never knew that he was also selfish, sly, and so self centered.The films best part however is the growth we see between Jobs and his daughter. There relationship starts of as a fragile one but slowly we see a very heartwarming relationship emerge, and in the end reels you may even shed a tear or two.Overall Steve Jobs, is a experimental film that is completely inspiring and moving, watch the film to see he rise of one the greatest entrepreneurs of the 21st century. In the end of Steve Jobs you will be left in awe, but I must say for as great as the film was, there was something still missing in the film don't know exactly what, maybe because I was excepting a biopic, but regardless its still a great film4/5* or 8/10",8,1,3,23 October 2015
12 Years a Slave," I am still numb... What a film, the film of the year!!! Mcqueen get ready for the Oscars
","Numb,in tears, and shocked is how i felt while watching 12 Years a Slave. A lot of films are well made, a lot of films entertain there viewers and while leaving the theater those films are already forgot. But 12 years a Slave does not entertain, it shocks with its true content,it takes one to a world that was once true, many put a blind eye to SLAVERY, but it was once a reality.12 Years a Slave is the story of Solomon Northup. Solomon a free black man in New York, in the 1800's, has a family, a wife 2 kids, he is living the good life. He then on the pretense of getting a job with a circus with a good pay goes to Washington with 2 men. The 2 men however get Solomon drunk,kidnap him and sell him away to white men for slavery. Solomon pleads, cries that he is a free man, but no ones hears. Here starts his journey of slavery, he gets beaten, he sees black women get raped, he is forced to work, he sees all his rights be abolished, he sees such horrible things happen to African American people which are unnameable, and completely disgusting. Does Solomon get freed,does he reunite with his family, does he fall prey to circumstance like all the other African American people around him.How he and many other African American people cope with slavery and its harsh, disgusting ways forms the main plot.Acting wise the film has many marvelous performances but three performances stand out. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup is the films life line, he gives his lifes best, and the best performance of the year. One feels he is pain and agony in the film, and in the climax when Solomon cries, one also sheds a tear. Michael Fassbender as the slave ridden master, is menacing, he acts so well that one hates him on screen. Brad Pitt as the Canadian that believes in equality is a little stereotypical, but he has a important role, and adds a mature performanceA couple questions I asked myself after exiting the theater was WHY? Why was the life of a black man any less than a white man. Are not all human beings equal, does a color make such a difference. Who gave anybody the right to enslave a whole race, the right to beat them, rape them, make them work without pay etc mercifully... Slavery in America should not have ever happened,this is what this film explain, all humans are EQUAL.... The film preaches that we have to learn from our mistakes and make sure nothing even close to this happens again.The film of the year, Director Steven Mcqueen get ready for the Oscars, thats the biggest complement i can give you, you made a path breaking film!!!!A MUST WATCH FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS...",10,4,8,26 November 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Life of a stock broker in NY= SEX, DRUGS, MONEY AND LOADS OF ENTERTAINMENT
","The Wolf of Wall Street opens with a montage of such debauchery, it's appalling and fascinating at the same time. Leonardo DiCaprio, playing real-life stockbroker-scamster Jordan Belfort, tosses midgets across his office floor, crash-lands a helicopter while stoned out of his mind, and snorts cocaine off a hooker's ass. All this in the first five minutes. The film carries on, much in the same vein, for three hours.Based on Belfort's own memoir about getting insanely rich from conning investors, The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a delirious, manic black comedy about an amoral but magnetic protagonist so consumed by greed that he makes Gordon Gekko look like the Pope in comparison.Belfort starts out as a young man who gets a job as a stockbroker, then loses his job during the 1987 market crash. He starts his own firm, having figured out a way to make big bucks by selling worthless penny stocks. He turns out to be such a smooth seller that in no time he and his merry band of no-gooders (led by a terrific Jonah Hill as his bucktoothed sideckick Donie Azoff) have more money than they know what to do with. So they blow it on hookers, booze, and ridiculous quantities of drugs. Before long Belfort and his hedonistic lifestyle catch the eye of a hungry FBI agent (Kyle Chandler) who becomes determined to take him down.Scorsese, who is no stranger to stories about men behaving badly, keeps the pace brisk and the proceedings outrageous. There is a frantic energy to the movie until the very end, although scene after scene of wild orgies and drug-fueled hazes begin to get repetitive after a point. It's DiCaprio's top-notch portrayal of this abhorrent but compelling market wiz that never lets your interest in the movie wane. He offers a solid, brave performance that reaches a fever pitch each time Belfort takes the mike to motivate his team. The actor also gets a terrific opportunity to show off his comic chops in one of the film's most memorable scenes in which he slithers and crawls in a party -drug-induced stupor from a country club to his Ferrari and proceeds to drive home.In smaller roles, Matthew McConaughey as Belfort's unscrupulous mentor, chews up the scenery in a crackling restaurant scene, while Margot Robbie gets some well-deserved laughs as Belfort's trophy wife.The Wolf of Wall Street is consistently engaging, but is it meant to celebrate this reckless pursuit of wealth, or serve as a cautionary tale against it? That's for each one of us to decide. To give credit to Scorsese, he's made a film that works on more than one level, and a film that inspires debate. I'm going with four out of five for The Wolf of Wall Street. In their fifth collaboration, Scorsese and DiCaprio once again do their best work together.",8,0,6,6 January 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," Kudos to the Coen brothers for making a hilarious and highly entertaining film.
","The Coen brothers don't make bad films,they actually either make classics like Fargo, No Country For Old Men etc or they make near classics like the superbly entertaining film Hail Caesar which I viewed today. I mean these brothers have dabbled in making thrillers, biopics, gory films, comedies, they are masters of all genres. There is a reason why there name is listed with some of the best filmmakers of the world. And with Hail Caesar they strength there status, and make a comedic film on Hollywood and the studio system /rise of communism in Hollywood.While the film was not no extraordinary piece of cinema I would call pathbreaking as maybe you thought was in the offering from the Coen brothers, they actually make there most commercial film till date, and make sure the audience is fully entertained with the extravagant world they create. Hail Cesar is easily the most entertaining film I have seen in this new year of 2016. The film never has a dull moment, here we get see the hilarious insides and outs of Hollywood in the year 1950. The way films are made, how they are casted, all have such a hilarious truthful tone. Even the films main crux a kidnapping is done in a comedic manner. The film has no serious bone, but still Hail Caesar speaks volumes. However what makes Hail Caesar a great film is the casting, and the amazing performances, mainly speaking of Josh Brolin who just lights the screen on fire. Hail Caesar is the most fun I have had in theatres in 2016, however the film has a hangover of Trumbo which released last year, but more on that later.Story wise Slick Hollywood fixer Eddie Mannix is pressed into action when superstar actor Baird Whitlock is kidnapped and held for ransom by a communist group. Mannix races to quietly collect the ransom money without gossip columnist Thora Thacker catching wind of the scandal.Acting wise Josh Brolin as Eddie Mannix is the life of the film, he gives one of the best performances of 2016 till now in Hail Ceasar. He shows such variation in his character it's amazing, when he needs to underplay he does it beautiful, at times he is at his comedic best, and at times he is menacing as a Hollywood fixer. The scene when he is slapping George Clooney, and at the end says your a star, that scene was cinema at its best. George Clooney is good as the goof ball actor. Alden Ehrenreich is hilarious as the cowboy actor who can't even say a line proper, at times he steals the show with his comedic act, watch out for his conformation with Ralph Fiennes while shooting a scene in a film. Thora was great in a double role. Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and Scarlett Johansson all have cameos but they all add great weight age to the film. Hail Caesar has a beautiful ensemble to say the least.Hail Caesar gets the whole aura of 1950s Hollywood down to perfection. The type of actors there where back then ( there attitudes, mannerisms)the type of films that were being made, how the politics behind everything worked, etc was very well researched, and presented lavishly. The production values were superb, the sets, the costumes are first rate. An example of this is the introduction to Scarlett Johansson's characters, that scene is lavishly and beautifully done in the water.The Coen brothers make sure they even get the nitty gritty aspects of the film to perfection. The films main crux however is eerily similar to Trumbo were they speak about communism in Hollywood and the rights of writers etc, however while some novelty is lost here, the mood and the presentation of both films is polls apart. While Trumbo is a political film and speaks in favour of writers, Hail Caesar takes no stance at all, and just waves a comedy around the premise. Honestly the film is more of a day in life of a Hollywood fixer, rather than anything else. Hail Caesar is a hilarious entertaining comedy like I mentioned earlier,but the best thing is it's a sensible comedy, it's not your regular no brainer, it respects its audiences intelligence,and the film even has a good twist or turn. Two scenes in particular had me laughing my guts out and are the films highlight.The Laurence and Hobie scene when Fiennes is trying to teach the other to act. The other scene is when Brolin slaps,Coolney multiple times, and his reaction is priceless. Hail Caesar is just a entertaining film all around, it might not be a classic you were hoping from the Coens, it might not even win a Oscar( definitely will get a nomination or two), but in hindsight's does it matter, it's a smart comedy, and just think how many films can you say that about. Overall Hail Caesar is a highly recommended watch, it's hilarious and highly entertaining, and the films cast puts on a clinic of acting. The Coens brothers must applauded for making Hail Caesar, because like I have stated many times it was just such a fun film. Hail Caesar is the best English language film I have seen so far of 2016.4/5* or 8/10",8,6,15,5 February 2016
Dark Shadows," Funny and Dark
","Went in with many expectations when i went to watch dark shadows cause I am big Johnny Depp fan. Film relatively met those expectations, film turned out to be a well made horror comedy by the amazing duo Depp and burton. Recommended for all Depp and burton fans!!!Films main plot: In 1760, the Collins family migrates to America from Liverpool and sets up a fishing port in Maine, naming it Collinsport. Sixteen years later in 1776 the son, Barnabas (Johnny Depp), has an affair with a maid, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green), who is a witch infatuated with him since childhood. When he tells her he doesn't love or want her, Angelique kills his parents. Barnabas then falls in love with Josette du Pres (Bella Heathcote). In a fit of jealousy, Angelique bewitches Josette into leaping from a cliff to her death. Barnabas leaps after her in grief, but he survives because Angelique turns him into an immortal vampire. She rouses a mob to capture and bury Barnabas alive in a chained coffin in the woods and curses his family. One hundred ninety-six years later, in the year 1972, construction workers accidentally free Barnabas from his coffin, who reluctantly slakes his two-century thirst by feeding on and killing his rescuers",7,3,7,19 November 2013
The Conjuring," BOoOoOOOooo
","The Conjuring is a good horror film with a lot of scary and jumpy moments. The films story is about how a family which is going through some financial struggle has to move to the country into old house, which is haunted from its past.How this family hires two ghost busters to solve there problems forms the main plot. Its probably the best horror film of 2013. Old school horror tricks are used amazingly!!! This film comes when most horror films are falling flat on there face. James Wan is the new Saviour of horror films after such films like paranormal activity and Saw 100 have failed. A must watch for horror film enthusiast",7,0,1,19 November 2013
Straight Outta Compton," An entertaining watch, but the producers Cube and Dre looked out for there best interests. They forgot to give proper footage to Ren and Yella.
","Straight Out Of Compton, while entering the theatre as a fan boy, I told myself that I was going to leave all biases aside and I did,I just looked at the movie as any other story, not a story of a group I idolized since a young age.Therefore whatever I saw on screen was still pleasantly entertaining. But I would still like the point out that since film was produced by Ice Cube and Dre, they where shown to be the smart good guys, and the likes of DJ Yella, Mc Ren had almost no screen space, we didn't get to know any of there back story etc. However the film did outline the ups and downs of Rap group NWA in a fast, and entertaining manner. The 2hr 30 min length time breezed through. Also the film outlined many things that even fans didn't know about the group, like the involvement of Suge Knight in NWA, how Jerry Heller was reason of the rise and destruction of the group etc.Story wise the film is pretty much about the rise and fall of the Rap group NWA. The story mainly follows the life of Eazy-E, Dr Dre, and Ice Cube.Acting wise all the newcomers have done a decent job, the experienced Paul Giamatti as Jerry Heller is the best of the lot, he comes up with a mature act.It was nice to see that the film was not only limited to just NWA, we got to see the emergence of Ice Cube as a solo artist, how Dre started Death Row with Suge, how Snoop Dog and 2pac came up in the rape game. Also seeing topical issues in the film such as the violence against blacks by the cops, the huge gang and drug culture in the area of Compton. With this one gets too see how NWA came up with the music they did.Overall even though the second half of film does began to sink a little, with a slow pace, and not much entertainment on screen. Somes scenes in the film do seem corny also.The film as a whole does stay on to be a very entertaining and well done. Dir F Gary Gray has made an authentic film with the story he was given, even though it seems the producers interest where looked after more in the film, with a lot of scenes either made up for entertainment reasons or blown out of reason. Seem like the producers want to make themselves look the best. But I did love the Eazy-E tribute, RIP E. So if your a fan of the group its a must watch.3.25/5* or 6.5/10",6,8,37,14 August 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Wait till Captain America Civil War to watch a good superhero flick. The film does have good action but thats not enough.
","Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice doesn't really warrant a in depth review, and me not being a huge superhero comic fan I don't wanna get into the nitty gritty, but watching this film last night at 10:30 pm turned out to be the perfect cure for my insomnia. The film is by far one of the slowest paced films I have seen in awhile, and there are so many subplots that divert from the stories main crux that the main plot is actually rushed and insignificant. The whole Batman hating Superman problem is solved in 5 mins, and instead time is wasted showing insignificant characters like Aqua Man, Flash, and Cyborg which is obviously DC's way of promoting new superhero pictures coming up. Like I feel Batman and Superman fans were cheated out. The whole Bruce Wayne parents angle was also not convincing, and would it kill Clark Kent to smile once he is Superman. Zack Snyder the director should have token a lesson from Chris Nolan before trying to make a proper good superhero flick if compare both the Batman's there is no comparison. The whole Superman on trial thing was ridiculous too.And honestly Zack Snyder couldn't pick another Lex Luthor Jesse Eisenberg was overacting the whole time.Ben Affleck was okay as batman and Henry Cavill is adequate as superman. Amy Adams has nothing much to do as Lois Lane.The films only saving grace is the amazing action and CGI which was highlighted in the climax, especially when the films real star wonder woman starts kicking ass. Those last 30 min when things like the Bat mobile etc were highlighted I actual woke up and stood up in my seat in awe. Some of the best action scenes of the year for sure were in this film. The films scale and production values were mammoth top notch. However those last sequences don't make up for one the weakest films of the year, do yourself a favour and wait till Captain America Civil War to watch a good superhero film.2.25/5* Grade: 48% D",4,1,4,28 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Fans rejoice,simply put the new Star Wars film is bloody brilliant! The force has truly awaken...
","Its been 10 years since episode 3, and after waiting so long to see a Star Wars film that resembled episode 4.5.and 6 rather than the newer lot of ep. 1,2, and 3, as a Star Wars fan, my dream came true. The force has truly awaken with episode 7, and JJ Abraham as a fan boy of the series has steered the greatest film franchise ever back to its glory. I am going to try and keep this a spoiler free review because a lot did happen in episode 7, and I don't want to let the cat out of the bag for the true SW fans. But the nostigala feeling this film gave me was a high I wish I could chase forever. I was in awe seeing Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Chewie, and Lelia on the screen again. The film was paced so perfectly that the film was not even boring for a second, action, and drama was at its premium. The film almost finished at a blink of eye. While episode 7 is miles ahead of episode 1,2, and 3, its almost on par with episode 4.5 and 6. Which is bloody brilliant to say the least. But more on the analysis later.Story wise (spoiler free hopefully) thirty years after defeating the Galactic Empire, Han Solo and his allies face a new threat from the evil Kylo Ren and his army of Stormtroopers. But the search for Luke Skywalker is also on who has been hiding for almost 20 years, and he is the last remaining Jedi.Acting wise Harrison Ford as Han Solo was as charming as ever, and picked up were he left off with crazy, and superbly done brave antics. Peter Mayhew like Harrison Ford, is back at it with his lovable but also furious character Chewbacca, there chemistry together lights the screen up.John Bodega, as Fin is a character to look out for in the future SW films (he is a new addition), as his act is endearing, and he adds a good comic punch in the film.Oscar Isaac is good, but his character Poe didn't have much screen time, but one can tell he will be a main character in the future SW films. Adam Driver as the new villain Kylo Ren is a bit raw, but he is also very meaning on screen, and is a good follow up to Vader. But the actor who steals the show is Daisy Ridley as Rey, her vulnerable act is very heartening, but in the pre climax when she realizes her true powers, she overpowers everyone. Its a mind-blowing scene. JJ Abraham has introduced new important character in the Star Wars film in the form of Fin, and Rey etc, as they are the main protagonists in the film, and he has must be applauded for coming up with such perfect characters that compliment the SW films perfectly. A great addition to SW family.The film was not CGI heavy at all but the VFX were superbly done, and even a Oscar can come it way for the well done visuals.The action was mind-blowing, and keeps one glued to there seats, especially the pre climax fight. The films pacing was brilliant, the film does not have a dull moment.JJ handled the characters of yore perfectly, and made sure the essence of Ep. 4,5 and 6 stayed in tact with them. He has proved his worth as a director of the SW films, and must be applauded. Episode 7 in short is perfect film for fans, I won't say much because I want to keep the film spoiler free, so I am not going into complete detail but I can almost guarantee fans will not be disappointed. Furthermore the films pre climax fight, and climax will leave you in awe, they are amazing scenes . The film will make you cry, laugh, and cheer for the proceedings that go on,on the screen. The scene where Han Solo, and Chewie are introduced again gave me goosebumps. The films only minus is the plot though very well done at times looks like a remake of ep 4, 5, and 6. The film lacked originality, and the background score of the old SW films was missed.Overall fans can rejoice Star Wars is back, and episode 7 is almost near perfect, maybe even close to being a masterpiece for SW fans. So run to the theatres fans, but you don't need me to tell you that because most fans are watching the film as I write this. This film will break all box office record, and Avatar will seem like a joke a month from now, box office wise. Even if your not a fan, Episode 7 is the perfect Star Wars film to introduce yourself to the series (and get you addicted).Finally Star Wars is not a film for the fans of the series it a Religion, and the day the film releases its a holiday, so happy holiday to all fans!4/5* or 8/10",8,3,20,17 December 2015
The Purge," good concept, but failure to materialize
","The Purge is a high concept film ,thrilling in bits,but becomes clichéd and predictable after a point.Story about all crime allowed for 12 hrs with out any government and police involvement. The films main plot: Its the year 2022, the United States has become 'a nation reborn' thanks to the New Founding Fathers of America. Crime and unemployment rates hitting an all-time low due to the government having instituted an annual 12-hour period called 'the Purge' during which all criminal activity (including murder, theft, and rape) becomes legal. The only rules during the Purge is that government officials of 'ranking 10 or higher' must remain unharmed and usage of weaponry above 'Class 4' (such as WMDs) is forbidden. Also, the police and emergency services are suspended during this time and anyone who doesn't follow the rules of the Purge will be executed. The Purge is designed to act as a catharsis for the American people, so that they may vent all negative emotions and repressed urges however and on whomever they desire.",5,0,0,19 November 2013
Happy New Year," A happy, fun film.... A tribute to Shahrukh khan from Shahrukh himself!!!
","Charlie (SRK) is out on a revenge mission because his father Manohar (anupam kher) was conned by the crook Charan (Jackie Shroff) and put in jail for twelve years. The way to do that would be to steal diamonds worth 300 crores belonging to Charan. But for this, he has to take part in a world dance championship in Dubai. Despite not knowing dance, Charlie ropes in Jag (sonu sood) an ex-bomb squad member, Nandu (abhishek) who can puke anywhere anytime he wants, Tammy (boman) an expert lock opener, Rohan (vivaan) a hacker and Mohini (deepika) a bar dancer. Whether Charlie is successful in his mission or not forms the rest.The director has come up with a routine storyline and while the presentation was rich, the narrative was good . The dialogues were light hearted. The script was very average but the screenplay was effective at and enjoyable. The background score was melodious and three songs were worth watching. Cinematography was the main strength to this film. Editing was okay. Costumes were extremely stylish to suit the royalty while the art department was superb. The film belongs to Shah Rukh Khan and he was too good. Deepika Padukone has once again proved why she is the best. Abhishek Bachchan was hilarious. Sonu Sood was perfect. Boman Irani was versatile and entertaining. Vivaan Shah was apt. Jackie Shroff was fair. Anupam Kher was graceful.It is a huge challenge for any filmmaker to come up with a subject that justifies an ensemble cast and also provides the right kind of entertainment. In this film, the first half goes about with elements of humor, some romance and action as well. The interval bang was promising and the second half has a lot of dancing along with some amount of melodrama. Overall, this is a film which fits into the perfect masala potboiler and one should leave behind sensibilities and logic. A Diwali dhamka that the full family should enjoy, Farah Khan is back after TMK and yes this film will cross 200 crs.3.5/5* or 7/10",7,10,21,28 October 2014
Deadpool," At last an actual fun kickass superhero film. DEADPOOL. The film had scope to be better though.
","Superhero films are not really my thing, for me films like the Avengers, Transformers etc are comparable to Indian masala films, where the hero punches a guy and he goes flying in the air. It's what I call junk food cinema, it satisfies ones taste buds, but we all know junk food in excess just causes diarrhea. However with this weeks released Deadpool my expectations were a little higher than I would have from a Avenger film, this is because the trailer of Deadpool was kickass fun, and novel. Deadpool looked hilarious, and he seemed like a anti-hero who didn't want to save the world for the millionth time in the films trailer. Well in eventuality Deadpool was a little underwhelming than I thought it would be, but it was still great fun, and miles ahead of all the other superhero films I have seen except Guardians of Galaxy which I enjoyed slightly more. Deadpool is quirky, zany, and the humour is downright raunchy, and thats something you probably have not seen before in a superhero film. Deadpool is a satire of sorts on superhero films, but were the film should have broke the clichés it was making fun of, it in the end gets caught in the same rut . Deadpool works mainly because of the films badass hero Deadpool aka Ryan Reynolds who I have never liked in a film before ( acting wise) Deadpool,but more on that later.Story wise a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, who after being diagnosed with cancer in the final stage, he is then subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers, adopts the alter ego Deadpool. Armed with his new abilities and a dark, twisted sense of humor, Deadpool hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life.Acting wise honestly other than Ryan Reynolds nobody is really noticeable on screen, and that's a great thing for all Deadpool fans, because Ryan owns the screen. He is hilarious, he kickass like never before, and Deadpool doesn't want to save the world(thankfully). This is the first Ryan Reynold's performance I have enjoyed, and it's a bloody good one. Keep up the good work.Deadpool has a clichéd villain, there is a clichéd love angle, and there is a climax fight sequence were the superhero has to save something( luckily this time it's not the world) so the film is not really novel. But everything is done a quirky, zany satirical way, were everything is being made fun of,so one enjoys the proceedings, but I won't lie I excepted something a little more badass at times. For example the whole love angle in Deadpool could have been done with, the film would have worked without it in my opinion. However everything is being satired like I mentioned before, so even the cheesiest scene brings a laugh. Like the scene when the girlfriend is about to say will you give it to me in the a$$,and Wade says I love you ( he thought she wanted him to say that). Scenes like that evoke a huge amount of laughter. The films biggest plus is the raunchy, over the top humour. The films action sequences are top notch, and the bridge, and climax action sequences are feast for a action film lovers eyes. The added gore was nice touch too.The production values were good, but there eerily similar to Antman, but both are marvel films so it's expected I guess. I must say my favourite scene was when Deadpool, and the Xmen characters ( who I have never heard of)walkout in the climax fight with Dmx playing,that was badass. A special mention to the films Director for using Raj Kapoor's Classic song Mera Jhoota Hai Japani in Deadpool, that felt like a proud moment being a Indian, however the brown taxi driver character was too clichéd.Was also nice to see my hometown Vancouver BC as the main shooting location in the film.Deadpool's story and screenplay needed a bit of work because the character Deadpool gave scope to make a even better/bigger film, but the lacklustre predictable story bogged the film down.Overall after Guardians of Galaxy, Deadpool is the only superhero film I enjoyed. It's a film that never bores, and is great kickass fun. Minor blemishes aside for the regular cine goer this film could be a enjoyable prospect. For all you freaks who are superhero cinema fans( I am joking) you have already either the watched film, or reserved your tickets, so you don't need my recommendation. 3.25/5* or 6.5/10",6,2,13,12 February 2016
The Hangover Part III," bye bye las Vegas...
","Hangover3 was epic, it was hilarious, in my opinion the best out of all 3... zach galifianakis and bradely cooper killed it.films main plot :Two years after the events in Bangkok, Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) escapes from a maximum security prison, using a riot as cover. Meanwhile in America, Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) causes a 20-car freeway pileup after he purchases a giraffe and accidentally decapitates it on a low bridge. Alan's father Sid (Jeffrey Tambor), furious with Alan for never owning up to his mistakes, dies of a heart attack in the middle of a lecture. After the funeral, Alan's brother-in-law Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) informs friends Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper) and Stu Price (Ed Helms) that Alan has been off his ADHD medication and is out of control. They attend an intervention, in which Alan agrees to visit a rehab facility in Arizona, so long as 'the Wolfpack' takes him there. On the way to Arizona, Phil's minivan is rammed off the road by a rental truck and the group is taken hostage. They are later confronted by mob leader Marshall (John Goodman) and 'Black Doug' (Mike Epps), his head of security. He tells them that Chow hijacked half of a $42 million gold heist and, seeing how Alan has been the only one to communicate with Chow during his imprisonment, deduced that the Wolfpack could locate him and retrieve the gold. Marshall kidnaps Doug as collateral and gives the others three days to find Chow, or else Doug will be killed",7,0,2,19 November 2013
Spectre," A formulaic Bond film,the film had some amazing action sequences but for a fan of the series, I was left disappointed...
","Spectre was Daniel Craig's final adieu to the James Bond franchise, arguably one of the best actors to play James Bond, expectations were high from Craig and Director Sam Mendes, who made the last Bond, one of Craig's best bond films Skyfall. But sadly this James Bond film left me very underwhelmed, this is the first film I watched and didn't directly right a review on it, I actually slept on the film, because being a fan of the spy thriller series, I wanted the film to be good, but even after a nights rest (and thinking)Spectre still at best can be called a okay film. The film tries to be so much, it tries to tie in the last 4 bond films together, it tries to bid Craig goodbye in a happy way, it tries to live up to all the hype of the last film, but eventually Spectre fails almost all accords because the film doesn't have a proper coherent story. However there are some really good action scenes, the production values are top notch, the film is eye pleasing,its a decent action flick, and the films first hour is good, but after that Spectre just falls down. But more on the analysis later. Story wise a cryptic message from M before she died leads James Bond to Mexico City and Rome, where he meets the beautiful widow of an infamous criminal he killed in Mexico. After infiltrating a secret meeting, 007 uncovers the existence of the sinister organization Spectre. Needing the help of the daughter of an old nemesis, he embarks on a mission to find her. As Bond ventures toward the heart of Spectre, he discovers a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks. Bond of course is doing all this while suspended from his job and while MI6 and the 00 program is on the verge of being shutdown by the new C.Acting wise in every Bond film only one act standouts and thats of James Bond AKA Daniel Craig. He fits the role like a glove, and he performs the action scenes with a gusto in a three piece suit. He will be missed as Bond. Christopher Waltz is decent as the new Bond villain but at times he seems wooden, and in front of the likes of Javier Bardem (the Skyfall villain)he seems like a demotion to the viewers.Spectre starts of on a great note, the films beginning sequence in Mexico city is breathtaking, but things take a down turn after the films first hour. The film story is very poor, its that of every other clichéd spy thriller. And while the action at key intervals does engage the viewer, one excepts more for highly acclaimed Bond series. The film just is missing the substance, and thrill Skyfall had, and at times it even felt like Bond was disinterested in the proceedings. The Bond villain was also weak compared to the other villains of the past films, and while Waltz is shown as the almighty and powerful he is killed very easily and its actually kind of funny(not in a good way).Spectre can be termed as a formulaic Bond film, that doesn't rise above the former Bond Skyfall, and the ending for me was the most disappointing thing about the film, it was way too fluffy. But the over the top huge spectacle action sequences do make up for a lot of films minuses. Watch out for the Mexico City action sequence.Overall for a fan of the Bond series there is enough crazy gizmo's (Omega Seamaster), amazing cars(Aston Martin), and sexy women to please your eyes just don't go in theaters excepting a MI-5 type of sequel. Spectre is a good action flick, but as a Bond film it does disappoint. I am going with a nice: 3/5* or 6/10",6,4,12,6 November 2015
Her," The future of love...
","'Her' is a masterpiece in both storytelling and romance, a film that shows that love can defy all matters of what you are and how we see one another. Spike Jonze has created a brilliant work that is one of the most original works I have seen in a long time, with Joaquin Phoenix giving another phenomenal performance that carries the movie into success. Phoenix plays the lonely, introverted Theodore Twombly, a man whose job is to write romantic letters for people who can't do it themselves. He buys an A.I. operating system named Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, a software that is fully aware and adapts to grow more feelings and emotions. The two form a bond, but through their close relationship they create a romance that helps save them both in more ways than one. First of all, this is a great character study and brilliant view on where our society is heading in the world of technology. We see Theodore lives in a society that is similar to ours but has enhanced technology that I suspect is not too far off from out times, making this a bit of a sci-fi but not really. Jonze has always been one to go outside the norm of movie-making and here he proves that once again with a funny and dramatic view on how dependent our society has become to technology. But behind all that is a romance between a man and his computer that is based on love and joy. Some people may think a love between a human and computer is possible, but hey, is it really any different than most men and their lives today. We are constantly on our phones and social networks so I see this movie as an overlook on the world and its no-so-distant future. Phoenix has given us a brilliant and heartbreaking performance that makes this movie feel like a kindled spirit, proving that a romance between a man and a voice can be lovely indeed. Watching 'Her' makes me believe that there is love out there for everybody, maybe just not always in the way you expect.",10,1,4,10 January 2014
The Great Gatsby," Leo, Mcguire, and Bachchan= AMAZING
","Having not read Great Gatsby, the trailer of the film seemed very interesting... Well when i watched the film i was mindblown, the 1920s were never so beautiful, the film was not only a visual masterpiece but it also had a multi- layered plot of love, a mystery man, and alchol ban. For me the film narrative was superb, amazing story, and finally Leo, and Tobey, gave applaud worthy performances. A must watch film for all, because its easily one of the best films of the year. Only real minus of the film its length could be 15-20 min shorter. And also being Indian seeing Amitabh Bachchan next to Leo was a HONOR!!!! A must watch, its got epic cast, and epic performances.",8,0,1,19 November 2013
The Martian," A ambitious, and endearing story, but a flawed one. Martian is a one time watch.
","Okay I am going to be in the very small majority that didn't love Martian, and believe me after reading the rave reviews etc, I really tried to love it but maybe it the sky high exceptions, made the film a okay/good watch at best .My theory for not loving the film is exactly what Matt Damon's character says in the film 'we got to science the heck out of this', meaning for me the film had too much science, numbers, etc, I didn't find that kind of stuff that interesting this time around in Martian, but its surprising because, I thought Interstellar was amazing, maybe that was the Nolan affect, I don't know. But the film was still fairly good in my eyes, because,just think how hard it would be to be survive on earth if you very left with almost nothing and stranded on a deserted island.Now forget about earth, and think about the same conditions but on mars. Yeah its like a million times worst. So Martain does make for an endearing story, and the VFX in the film is simply amazing. The films starcast is also something to marvel over with the likes of Matt Damon,Jessica Chastain,Jeff Daniels, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. But as I stated above I had problems with the film that muddled my experience, but more on that later.Story wise the film is about NASA astronaut Mark Watney, and how after a storm hit Mars, his team has to leave back for earth, but Mark gets hit by a metal object in the wind storm, and is left on Mars, after his team thinks he is dead. Mark however survives, and soon figures out through the help of his botany expertise how to survive on Mars for a long time. Soon NASA realizes that Mark has survived also, and they try in which ever way to help Mark, but it will take at least 400 days before they can send someone back to Mars to get him back home.The rest of the story is about if Mark can survive on Mars, and make it back to earth safely.Acting wise the whole ensemble was pitch perfect. Matt Damon leads the way in one of his career best roles, his character is very endearing, and one feels like routing for him. Jeff Daniels has become the every so dependable actor and proves it again in this film. Chiwetel Ejofor is great, and his reaction in the rescue mission is priceless. Out all the NASA team members Jessica Chastain gets the meatiest role and is good.See I believe and this is just my opinion so beware, that if your not into science or a science geek at many junctures your going to be left dis interested while watching Martain. The film gets too much into the nitty gritty science facts numbers etc , and at times it feels like the film is not moving or nothing interesting is happening. For example you felt bad for Damon's character, and when he grew crops etc you were amazed but after a point you feel as Damon's character has adjusted to Mars and has no desperation. Also a lot things happen in the film really easily like when Mark finds the camera etc.The film has so much dialogue at one point you feel like the film is moving at snails pace,the film definitely needs a shorter length. But Martain also has many amazing features. Like the VFX for example is outstanding, Mars, and space never seemed so real, and beautiful. The films beginning, and especially climax are great, and the whole Damon, and Chastain scene in the climax will get your heart pounding. There are many scenes that evoke some laugher, and many scenes where you feel like clapping when Mark comes through with a break through on mars. And films is very detailed in all its research, the films crew definitely did its homework.Overall all negatives withstanding, watch Martian because one can see the kind of ambition that went into this Ridely Scott directorial, and there are enough good things in the film like the VFX, acting, climax etc to warrant one viewing, just don't go in the cinema hall with huge expectations. 3.25/5* or 6.5/10",Null,4,46,3 October 2015
