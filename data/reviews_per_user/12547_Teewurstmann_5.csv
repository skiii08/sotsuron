Catch Me If You Can," Good entertainment with a great DiCaprio
","8 out of 10 To cut it short: This is a really good movie worth watching. It is based on a true story, the story of Frank W. Abagnale (www.abagnale.com) You should visit his website and read his thoughts about the book and the movie. Of course things are dramatized, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. And just because most women love 'Leo', it doesn't make him a bad actor, he's actually an outstanding artist.DON'T MISS IT!",8,0,1,11 February 2003

8 Mile," great song, excellent Eminem, OK movie
","6 out of 10 - OK, I love the title song. It ties in perfectly with the movie. And Eminem proves to be a serious, and surprisingly good actor. But all in all the movie didn't really grab me. It had good character development, but it also had parts that were just stretched too far... it could have explored the character even farther, even deeper...Well, it was certainly a great debut for Eminem as an actor!",6,0,1,14 February 2003
Signs," the new century's 'Birds' and 'Night of the Living Dead' with aliens
","9 out of 10 This is basically a mix of 'The Birds' and 'Night of the Living Dead' without birds and without zombies, but with freaky aliens and a lot more humor. I really like this movie and I think I've seen it about 5 times already. It is very well acted, with a great Mel Gibson and a remarkable Joaquin Phoenix. An outstanding scene in terms of acting is the scene where Mel Gibson is confronted with the guy who accidently killed his wife (played by the director - I still can neither pronounce nor spell his name) because he fell asleep in the car. The sadness and the anger on Mel Gibson's face is amazing.DON'T MISS IT!",9,0,1,11 February 2003
