Casablanca," Good but normal movie -- cannot live up to its high reputation
","To me, it only deserve a score of 8 out of 10 at most. The story is not so great, not so moving, though it is a good movie to watch. Since so much people ranked it so highly, I guess the reasons are: too big a time lap between WWII and the start of millennium, and too much of the movie copied by various other movies.",7,3,8,21 January 2001
Doctor Zhivago," Great love story which is under-rated in IMDB
","The rating is only 7.4 at time of this message. This movie definitely deserves a much higher rank.This is the best, or at least one of the best, movies I've ever watched. The beginning of the movie is not so attention grabbing, though. I had nearly given up watching it before being caught by the plot half an hour into the movie.One other reason why this movie is under-rated may come from the lack of background information about the revolution in Soviet Union.Recommendation: please watch it for at least half an hour before taking the videotape out of the VCR, and you will be amazed after the movie is over.",10,1,2,10 April 2001
