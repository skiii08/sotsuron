The King's Speech," An absolute MASTERPIECE!
","I can't remember when I've enjoyed a drama on the big screen - since 'The Straight Story' by David Lynch, as much as I have enjoyed this particular film. Every shot and shot were masterpieces by themselves, as oil paintings on canvas, the editing made these 'oil paintings' into sheer poetry on film, and the magnificent sound was just the topping on this delightful cake... The script is eloquent (no pun intended!) and conveys a simple story, yet with all meaningful complexities of soul and mind. Magnificent casting, impeccable directing and acting. I heard it was excellent and it even exceeded my expectations. This movie definitely gets both my thumbs up! Highly recommended for lovers of the fine art of film-making.",10,1,2,1 February 2011
Corpse Bride," Tim Burton has done it again!
","An absolutely Amazing stop-motion animation movie! Tim Burton never ceases to amaze... A Very good cast does the voices, and the animation crew done a superb job from character and set modeling to the motion itself. Something that gave me a good laugh was a very small and nearly unnoticeable line in the movie - in which Mr. Everglot calls Victor (the hero) 'Vincent' by mistake... This, as I believe, is somewhat of an 'Inside' joke of Tim Burton's... since one of his early movies (short claymation movie) is called 'Vincent', which is a real gem (should be a classic and taught in film-schools, in my humble opinion). In 'Vincent' - the main character looks like an earlier version of Victor, something I noticed right away - just by looking at the 'corpse bride' movie poster. I recommend watching both 'Vincent', and 'Corpse Bride'... Actually - most of Tim Burton's movies.",10,0,1,3 January 2007
