Ford v Ferrari," Great movie
","It is not the best movie I've ever seen, but is the best movie I've seen lately. The cast was very good, especially Bale, and the storyline and the action didn't let me get bored. I think it deserves an Oscar.",10,3,5,3 January 2020
Joker," A little bit overrated
","I mean, I liked the movie, a lot, but I think that the movie was not that good as everyone is saying, but the actor had an Oscar performance and it deserves it for this role. Joaquin was remarkable and without mistake, he succeed in taking me down deep in his story and in his social problems. I think that this movie is a good alert for the ones that don't care about other people, but only about themselves. I recommend it.",9,1,4,3 January 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Absolutely Great
","The storyline, the links, the twists, everything about this movie made me want to watch it all over again. It is the best movie I've seen by far. I recommend it 100%.",10,2,3,3 January 2020
