Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Merchandising Menace
","First off, I'm a Star Wars fan.  I love everything about Star Wars. However, that is not enough to praise this movie as being excellent.  For all the Star Wars fans out there thinking this is the best movie ever, simply because it's Star Wars, think about what made the original trilogy classic in the first place.  Those elements are remarkably absent in Episode I.  Instead, the movie is nothing but a tiring repetition of special effects and idiotic jokes.  The mere presence of a character like Jar Jar Binks is inexcusable, let alone his role as a main character.Think about it this way: Without the Star Wars theme to the movie, it would be worthless.  The only thing that holds Episode I above mediocrity up is the original trilogy's reputation.I'm very disappointed.",6,0,1,21 July 2000
