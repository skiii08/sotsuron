The Blair Witch Project," Terrible!
","When I first heard of the Blair Witch Project, and from what the critics were saying of how good it was, I decided to rent it. I was very disappointed. It was the worst horror movie I have ever seen! It wasn't even scary! There is no plot or storyline, and the camera was hand held so the camera was shaking through out the whole movie. I have no clue why a lot of people liked this movie, but I hated it. Do not rent this movie!",5,0,2,14 May 2001

The Ring," The Scariest Movie I Have Seen In A Long Time.
","Okay, now let me say, I was almost covering my ears because of all the jump scenes in this movie. The Ring was simply terrifying, and is the scariest movie I have ever seen. Naomi Watts was also good, and I had seen her in CHildren of the Corn 4, which she also did a good job in. The video tape that they watch in this movie is slightly disturbing, I mean, a girl crawling out of a well, a person pulling a string out of their mouth, a pit of maggots! YUCK! All in all, If you want to sleep with the lights on for three months than you should see The Ring. I give The Ring a 10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,19 December 2002

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Mumbo Jumbo Action & Pirate Movie!
","Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003)Again, Gore Verbinski strikes gold as he did in 2002's 'The Ring'! Pirates Of The Caribbean was a definite action movie nonetheless. It's great for young kids who's heros are pirates, and is as well a great movie for adults to enjoy too. Johnny Depp does a wonderful performance as Jack Sparrow. Geoffrey Rush does also an excellent performance as always. There is lots of sword clashing, cursed skeleton pirates (including a monkey), stolen gems, and what more could you want!

"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Sometimes Entertaining and Interesting, But Not Very Funny.
","This movie is a pretty stupid movie from what I think. I've seen tons of movies with plenty and plenty of swearing, but this movie went WAY overboard. Even though South Park is a show that repeatedly involves swearing, this movie broke the barriers. Although, I noticed the voices of George Clooney and Minnie Driver. This movie is a must-see for the tv show fans, but otherwise, I don't recommend seeing it. I give South Park Bigger, Longer, Uncut a 3 or 4 out of 10.",Null,0,1,14 November 2001

That made the film even scarier!!                ******END OF EXTREME SPOILER******             All in all, this is a brillaint horror film with a great twist, which deserves a 10 out of 10!!!!!!!

The Jungle Book," Disney Simply At It's Best Ever! The Most Joyful Disney Film Created!
","The Jungle Book is a great classic animation movie. It is famously known for being the last film that Walt Disney himself ever got to work on. He died while the film was in production, and sadly never got to see the outcome of the movie. The animation in this film is excellent, and the songs and performances are even better! Each character has something about him or her that makes you like them. The movie seems to be very cheery and happy. I remember watching this movie as a little kid, and I absolutely loved it!

Scary Movie 2," Just As Humorous. Just As Gross. Just As Fun.
","I have to say, Scary Movie 2 was REALLY funny. Okay, so it wasn't as good as the first, but hey, isn't that how all sequels are??? The cast is  even better than the cast in the first. Scary movie 2 spoofs movies such as The Exorcist, House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Hollow Man, Charlie's Angels, and more. Anna Farris, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Regina Hall, Tori Spelling, Tim Curry, Chris Elliot, and James Woods were great in the movie. Keenen Ivory Wayans has done it again! I really liked the scene when Cindy was fighting the black cat in the bedroom, and I also liked the part when Cindy was singing along with the radio, and then Vitamin C cut in, and told her to shut up and let her sing the song! That part was really funny. All, in all I give Scary Movie 2 a 10 out of 10!!!  :)",Null,0,2,18 December 2001

Final Destination 2 is about Kimberly (AJ Cook), an average girl has a premonition of her, her friends, and many others being killed in a terrible road accident. The premonition proves true, and her friends die, except Kimberly and some others she saved (she was pulled away by a cop).

Kimberly consults help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), who is now in a mental hospital after the tragic events of Flight 180 2 years before. Clear decides to help Kim, and cheat Death once and for all, before fate consumes more survivors.

Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Seann Willaim Scott, Tara Reid, Tom Ian Nicholas, Alyson Hannigan,  Natasha Lyonne, Mena Suvari, and Eugene Levy make up a hilarious and likeable cast for the film. The film is upright hilarious and drop dead funny. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I'm sure it's just as funny. Als, Jennifer Coolidge did a funny performance as Stifler's Mom. By the way, take my advice, because some people say that 'Scary Movie' was better, but it is DEFINETLEY not.

Edward Scissorhands," Great Movies Don't Get Any Better Than This.
","Edward Scissorhands is a remarkable and great film that I think was a little underrated. Johnny Depp and Winona Rider were great and add greatness to the picture. The film has a sort of fantasy/fairytale setting, and gets better and better till the end. Edward Scissorhands is the BEST fantasy movie ever, and there is no doubt at all. The acting was great and the brilliant Tim Burton brought the picture to life, just like he did Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow. Tim Burton is a great director and really kind of has his own genre of the way he does his films. Also he did a good job directing Batman. (even though I'm not a Batman fan the directing was great)The film itself has it's own way to make you believe it all, and has a fairytale touch to it which is also very good, and the romance also lends a great touch to the movie itself.

This film ranks one of the highest on my horror list. Linda Blair was excellent as the possessed Regan and they also did a wonderful job on making her look as if she were possessed. The makeup was great and she looked so scary you could barley explain it. If you are horror fan or have interest in scary movies, you should definetley watch The Exorcist.

Then, Evan goes back to save her through his journals, changing his past, thus changing his present.Ashton Kutcher does suprisingly good with a serious role, after seeing his in Dude, Where's My Car and Just Married, he seems to be good with comedy, but he is good.

Big Fish," 'Big Fish'- 9/10. Wonderful story and set decoration, may be Burton's best work yet.
","Big Fish (2003)This film focuses on Will Bloom (Billy Crudup), a young man with a pregnant wife, a mother (Jessica Lange), and a father (Albert Finney). A father who told Will many stories and tall tales as he grew up. At one point, Will stopped believing his dad's stories. Then, at Will's wedding, his father tells his most infamous tall tale- the story of how he caught an uncatchable fish the day Will was born. Sick of hearing his father's stories, they do not speak for over three years, until they are reunited when his father is diagnosed with cancer. And throughout all of his father's stories- ones involving a town named Spectre where no one wears shoes, to a sideshow circus owned by Amos Callaway (Danny Devito), where his father supposedly worked for three years in order to find the woman he was destined to marry, all the way to a lonely giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory) -, Will begins to find some truth in his father, something he has never seen before.I simply enjoyed this movie, with it's ability to dazzle you with fairy tale-like settings in his father's stories, and to it's ability to strike you with sad moments. Tim Burton created a masterpiece of cinema. I love the set decoration in the towns in his father's stories, especially Spectre, and all of the set decoration on the old trail in the woods. The movie had a wonderful ending, but I don't want to spoil this film for you- it's too much of a gem. 9/10.",Null,0,0,18 January 2004
"Girl, Interrupted"," The Best Drama I've Ever Seen.
","Girl, Interrupted is one of the the best drama films I have ever seen. It was probably the best movie of 1999. The movie had a spectacular cast: Winona Ryder as Susan Kaysen, Angelina Jolie as the crazy and witty Lisa, Clea DuVall as the Wizard of Oz-loving pathelogical liar, Whoopi Goldberg as Nurse Owens, Brittany Murphy as Daisy, Jared Leto as Toby Jacobs, and Jeffrey Tambor as the doctor for Susanna. This movie is about  Susanna Kaysen, who spends time in Claymoore Mental Hospital. This movie was really brilliant and James Mangold directed it brilliantly. And since the movie was based on a true story, that made it even better. The movie is sad at times, and seems very real when you are watching it. This is a movie that is very entertaining, which never keeps you bored. This is a highly recommended film. I give Girl, Interrupted a 10 out of 10!!!!!  :)",Null,1,1,1 February 2002

From Hell," The Legend Is Reborn, and Is Simply Great!
","From Hell is a great retelling of Jack the Ripper. Albert and Allen Hughes were great at directing the movie. Johnny Depp and Heather Graham were also great.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Wonderful Adaption To The Bestselling Book.
","I just saw Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone tonight, and I have to give it an applause. I have read the book once, and the film matches up with the book, which is odd because usually the movies are always different from the book. Daniel Radcliffe did an okay performance as Harry Potter, as well as Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. The movie is a great family movie that is highly entertaining. The movie is a well adaption to the book, and is filled with mind blowing special effects and action. I give Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone a 10 out of 10. :)",Null,0,0,23 November 2001
Psycho," The Most Beautiful Piece of Art In Horror Making.
","This is truly the best horror film ever made. Any horror fan who dislikes this classic has to be paranoid. This is Alfred Hitchcock's most beautiful peice of work that I have seen. Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and Janet Leigh were all brilliant. I know most old black and white films don't get much of a look, and that's why I think Gus Van Sant had the idea of remaking Psycho, with the same lines and the same way the scenes were shot in 1960, so people could enjoy a movie that is more from their time. This is the best horror film ever made in Hollywood. I give Psycho a 1,000,000 out of 10!!!!!! :)",Null,0,1,24 June 2002
Rosemary's Baby," A Work Of Art In The Horror Film Industry!
","Rosemary's Baby is a brilliant Horror/Drama film. It is in the tops on my horror list. Mia Farrow, John Cassavettes, and Ruth Gordon who won a Golden Globe Award for the film, were all great. Roman Polanski has made a work of art, based on Ira Levin's classic novel. This movie is very good. I know most movies that are old don't interest people these days, but this one is a keeper for sure. I was afraid it would be too old fashioned for my taste, even thought I have seen films older than this, but it really wasn't! I give Rosemary's Baby a 10 out of 10!!! Oh, by the way, here is my list of top ten horror films:#1 Psycho (1960) #2 Rosemary's Baby (1968) #3 The Exorcist (1973) #4 Halloween (1978) #5 Scream (1996) #6 Friday the 13th (1980) #7 House On Haunted Hill (1999) #8 Carrie (1976) #9 The Rage: Carrie 2(1999) #10 The Dentist",Null,1,2,17 July 2002
Scream 2," Not as good as the first, but I liked it!
","'Scream 2' was not as good as the original 'Scream'. Scream 2 was not that bad, but I enjoyed it. The one thing I enjoy about the Scream movies is that, the killer can actually get hurt. In most slasher films, you can't even scratch the killer without him stabbing you, or cutting of your head. In the Scream movies the killer will get hurt if you hit him. He will fall if you push him. He will hurt if you cut him. At least these movies are realistic. I mostly enjoy all of the Scream movies, this one wasn't perfect, but I still enjoy it. The film is very good, but not perfect. I still enjoy this film, even if there are some things about it that I don't like. I'm going to watch 'Scream 3' today, so I hope I enjoy it like I enjoy most of the Screams. Overall, I like this movie, and it is very enjoyable. I give it a 9 out of 10.",8,0,1,12 June 2001

This is a terrific film.                         ******SPOILER ALERT****** I also thought is was neat when Jon Coffey (Michael Clark Duncan) saved the mouse that the rude,  inconsiderite, and mean Percy stepped on.                       ******END OF SPOILER******       All in all, this is a terrific film and I give it a 10 out of 10!!!!!!   :)",Null,0,1,10 August 2001
Jaws," This makes you scared to go in the water!
","Jaws makes you scared to go in the water at the beach. This is a very creepy movie. The shark scares me. Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job directing the film, although that doesn't suprise me, Steven Spielberg always does excellent job directing his films. The shark is very creepy, and after seeing this movie, the next time you go to the beach, you probably won't want to swim in the water. The movie is pretty good, not that scary, but the shark is pretty creepy. Steven Spielberg always does a good job on his movies, so this one was well done. All in all, the movie wasn't great, but wasn't bad. I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,11 June 2001
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Wonderful.
","Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs (1937)Snow White was the first Disney movie ever made, and is still the best known movie of all time. The movie had beautiful animation, and was followed up by Filmation's 'Happily Ever After'- the second story in the Snow White Legacy. Filmation's attempt was very good, and the movie was still funny and enjoyable, but it will never ever match up to it's original. I give Snow White a 10/10.",Null,2,2,9 August 2003
Bring It On," Great fun!
","Bring It On is a fun movie. The music is cool and the cheerleading moves are good. Kirsten Dunst did a good job in her role as Torrance. This movie is exciting, and reminds me of Coyote Ugly. Maybe It's because they dance in both movies. When this movie came out in theaters, I didn't get to see it, but I rented it, and I really liked it! The acting was good and the directing was good. If you liked Coyote Ugly, you should like this film! I give it a 9 out of 10! This movie is very good and funny! I recommend it!",9,0,0,11 June 2001

Scream," This is one of the best slasher films out there!
","'Scream' is practically the best slasher film out of all of them (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, etc). The movie delivers a chilling plot and story, and makes you think your being watched by the murderer in the ghost costume. Wes Craven did an excellent job on the directing. The acting was very good. Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Rose McGowan, Drew Barrymore, Courtney Cox and David Arquette did an excellent job in their roles. This movie is very creepy and very good. It makes you think there is a killer stalking you. If you are a movie person I recommend 'Scream', especially to horror fans. The movie is well done the acting is great, the filmmaking is excellent, and the movie is just plain great! This is a classic horror movie for anyone who has interest in horror films! This is my favorite slasher film out there. The movie is great! You should DEFINETLY rent this movie if you stop by your local video store. I'm sure any video store carrys it.

Halloween," A Great Horror Movie That Will Live On As A Classic Forever.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, Nancy Kyes, P.J. Soles, and Kyle Richards all gave good and believeable performances, and the movie was surely great alone. This movie will remain a classic forever. There wasn't too much blood in this movie, which most slasher movies have blood and guts flying everywhere, just to try to make it scarier, but this movie didn't even need that. This movie has classic written all over it. I give Halloween a 10 out of 10!!!  :)",Null,1,2,17 March 2002

Varsity Blues focused on high school football/high school life, but Any Given Sunday focuses on pro football, which is the real deal. This movie is long, about two and a half hours, but it was definetley worth it. Al Pacino was great as the coach of The Sharks. Cameron Diaz and James Woods were also great.

","Identity (2003) ***Contains Spoilers***After seeing Identity in a theater, I was very surprised at the sudden plot-twist at the ending, and was amazed at the suspense and thrills mixed together with it all. Identity is about a group of people who by chance all end up in a Nevada rainstorm, and all meet at a small, slummy motel. The group of people begin to be killed off one by one in grisly, horrifying ways, and begin to realize that each one of them have something uncannily alike. Example: they all have the same birthdays. Then, comes the entire plot twist where everything turns out to be in the eye of a mind, which can never expected by an audience.... I can't say though, it spoil the entire film and not make it worth watching. Identity is a smart and suspenseful horror movie that is meaningful and scary. I give it 10/10.",10,2,4,26 June 2003
