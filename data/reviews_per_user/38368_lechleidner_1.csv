Walk the Line," Good Flick
","I really really like this movie. I love any music or song that tells a story. I can even deal with rap music if it tells a story. This movie has something for everyone. Jonny Cash grows up poor, picks cotton, and then gets rich singing about it. Thats pretty cool. The only thing this movie is missing is a dog getting kicked. Johnny has all the traits. He fishes, he drinks,he smokes,he cheats on his wife, he does jail time. Hey and his dad was an ass. The movie makes a point that his dad is an ass from beginning to end.. The movie even shows a fat southern drug craving punk-face, named ' Elvis'. And a dork named Jerry Lee? Uggh? I need more lines. Uh, well, Johnny likes drugs, he likes jail, he likes to run with a woman thats not his wife, and uh, he likes drugs",8,0,2,12 April 2006
