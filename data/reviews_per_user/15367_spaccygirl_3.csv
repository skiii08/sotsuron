The Ring," A Scary movie about a tape when watched by a person dooms a person to death within 7 days
","This movie was soooo scary! I've seen other horror movies like The Shining, The Others, The Exorcist, The Innocents that are great movies that scared me while I was watching them but, not afterwards. After I saw 'The Ring', I was scared for days. I couldn't fall asleep at all. It was definitely the most disturbing horror movie that I have ever seen! I don't know if I'd recommend it to anyone because, I don't think that it is such a great thing to be scared of a movie after it's over but, if you think that your not scared of horror movies...this is one that you have to see!",10,0,0,2 November 2002
The Others," Great! This is an awesome movie!
","The scariest movie that I have ever seen! Everything, from the setting, to the sound, to the cinematography, actors and directors make this movie what it is; creepy. This is truly a suspenseful, scary gem! I was frightened for weeks.",10,0,0,28 September 2001
Spider-Man 3," Almost as bad as The Hulk
","Great special effects but bad story! I didn't care about anyone in this movie, not the guy not the girl. I didn't care if the guy got the girl. Well I did care about one person and largely because he's a very good actor and his character had the most depth, guess who? Harry. He was the only likable character of the main trio. Who else did I like? Gwen & Venom - also more depth. I really liked Venom. It's funny in a movie where you are supposed to be rooting for the heroes I was rooting for Venom and Harry. How odd. If they were to do this movie again, they should get a better story, one where you actually care about the characters. What's with the marriage plot? They are like 25. Average age to get married in this society 30. It was like a plot from 1910 or trying to marry people off at 18. In a movie, movies about marriage don't really cut it unless they are for 12 year olds, epics or romantic comedies with lots of crude fart jokes. I hate when they do this. They did it to superman: lois and clark. That was such a great show but then they tried to make superman a daddy. The action was great in this film but in the final action scene, I found myself saying 'is it over?' why because I didn't care. And also it didn't make sense. I mean Harry lives through being smashed against a brick wall, falling 50 feet, and a killer explosion with only second degree burns. Like come on. Spiderman saved him in the beginning in two seconds by rushing him to a hospital, like he couldn't manage that again in the 10 minutes of sap. He certainly had enough time.",1,5,8,22 May 2007
