The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Very, very, very boring (very)
","Let me put it this way - I'm not gonna bother seeing part 2 - I'm not a huge fan of the Twilight films but my wife wanted to see this - I always judge how good a film is by how often I glance at the DVD player's timer throughout the movie, I can tell you this, it was more interesting than the film!Usually you can't keep me away from a good vampire/ lycanthrope flick - This was more like a poorly written romcom (without the com).OK, if you're into wolf boy taking his shirt off then you might get at least some pleasure from this film - It almost made me want to join a gym, almost.There's very little action for a vampire / lycanthrope film and what action there is takes place at night and in really low light so you can't really see what's going on anyway.Now, some might say that this is the big build up to the final film, but even so...geees!I reckon they had enough story for about 2 hours but instead of making one OK final film they decided to water it down in a two parter to try and ring some more dollars out of the franchise.Why aren't there real vampires in the world right now? They all killed themselves after watching Breaking Dawn Part 1",3,5,6,21 November 2012
