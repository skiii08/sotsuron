Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," I love Abraham Lincoln and I love this movie so much
","Since I read this novel a few months ago, I have been looking forward to this movie excitedly. It turns out to live up to my expectation. The movie doesn't not strictly follow the book and has changed it a lot. I think most of the changes are successful, though I'm very disappointed the story about Lincoln leading a team to hunt down Jefferson Davis was cut and Ann Rutledge did not even mentioned in the movie. Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie from the beginning to the end.The movie does not look as that ridiculous as this title. There is the part Abraham played the real vampire hunter who used his axes and guns to kill those evil blood suckers, and on the other side it is the historical Lincoln who believed the Deceleration of Independence, the Union, and the liberty of mankind.In the movie the two themes look close to be seamless. While I enjoyed the exciting actions of fights between Lincoln and vampires, the heated debate between Lincoln and Douglas, his election to the White House, his final dedication to the great Emaciation, and his immortal Gettysburg speech all brought the real life of Lincoln on screen. I especially like how Mary Todd Lincoln is portrayed in the movie. I know her real life was absolutely miserable. The loss of children and the war had already ruined her happiness (and happiness of millions). But she later lost her beloved her beloved husband and witnessed his assassination, and then lost another son who had became her only comfort after that night at Ford's theater. Historians used to be too strict to her I think and I am glad to see her become a war hero herself in the movie which brings much comfort. Some people may say it goes to far to relate one of the greatest president to Vampires and it is a little disrespectful. But I think although we should know the real historical Lincoln, he is already a mythical to some extent. In my opinion, making him a mythical hero is just another way to remember the true Abraham Lincoln who sacrificed everything for this country and this world.",8,4,8,22 June 2012
