Casablanca," One of the greatest wartime love stories
","A ten score if there ever was one! It is difficult to say anything that hasn't already been said about this classic. Humphrey Bogart was in his early forties when CASABLANCA was made, but this kind of romance is ageless. Ingrid Bergman couldn't have been more attractive.No man could have been more love smitten than Rick, and he finds solace in the bottle and the ballad, AS TIME GOES BY. This movie and that song are inseparably intertwined to many viewers.Claude Rains heads a fine supporting cast. As Captain Renault, he walks a fine line between disrespect and reluctant obedience in dealing with the Nazis. His whimsy and humor are just a pleasure. Paul Henried is quite subdued in comparison.Many of the one liners are well known. One of my favorites is, ' He's like all men, only more so.' Figure that one out. At the very end, 'This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' leaves you with a warm, positive feeling.Oh, I have some trivial comments about CASABLANCA. Nobody is ever seen eating in the CAFE AMERICAINE. Perhaps all the action took place after 10 pm.There never was a more desolate airport in the final scene. Only one airplane and not a single person around. Neither do Rick and the captain seem in any particular hurry in leaving, after Strasser was shot. Surely the Nazis would soon be in hot pursuit.Do they make them like this anymore? I don't think so. This is one that no one should miss, young or old.",10,2,4,28 December 2016
Lifeboat," All Aboard!
","LIFEBOAT impressed me so much more the second time around, considering I was a kid the first time. Back then I thought Bankhead's kiss of Hodiak was the sexist thing I ever saw on screen.All the performers were superb. Character development couldn't have been better in every case. Much has been said about everyone except maybe Henry Hull. Here was a 'bend over backwards to be fair', millionaire industrialist in a splendid performance, who changes his tune at the end.Oh, I wondered why Tallulah was immaculately alone in the boat, and how they miraculously avoided the shelling and collision, and how Nazi captain Walter Slezak was so deft removing a limb as a non-surgeon using merely a pocket knife, and other trifling incidents, but it didn't change my opinion one iota of this terrific film. For Hitchcock's extraordinary direction, splendid close up photography, and great story telling, it is hard to beat LIFEBOAT.",9,1,1,26 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A brand new Star Wars and not a sequel
","I am sorry to say this film was a major disappointment. The excessive hype led me to expect more. Having seen the other STAR WARS and enjoyed them, I felt there is a basis for my remarks.The story line was difficult to follow and the scenes shifted too quickly to get a firm grasp as to what was going on. This is particularly true of the battle episodes. A war movie, it is, but one could often focus for only a few seconds before another aspect of the battle came up. Less scene shifting and longer exposure was needed. To see droves of storm troopers singlehandedly being mowed down was overdone, too.Some of the visuals were impressive and a few scenic settings attractive. I allude to the beach and sunset scenes. It was a nice touch to have Carrie Fisher appear at the end of the picture, also.",4,2,5,6 January 2017
The Revenant," Set in the 1820s, this is the tale of a fur trapping expedition that encounters hard times.
","Good but not superior. Spectacular mountainous scenery was a great asset as was the realism. Di Caprio's performance was impressive considering he had so few lines and a number of those were unintelligible. What troubled me, and I am sure very few others, is that the Pawnees lived in non-mountainous Nebraska far, far away from those towering peaks and tall firs. If the Indians were Blackfeet of Montana or Canada, it would have been reasonable. I should think such an item should have been researched. This film would rate high as far as violence and suffering go. Di Caprio was mauled, shot, stabbed, and practically drowned and frozen. The faces of the actors were so obscured by hair that it was sometimes difficult to tell who was who. The ending was not definitive, but fit in with the course of the movie. An off beat, but enjoyable picture.",7,0,4,14 January 2016
Dunkirk," Too much hype for this one!
","I read the reviews, talked to people who had seen it, and was led to believe it was the greatest war movie of all time. Far from it. It can't be mentioned in the same breath as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, for instance, and I could name a good handful of others. I was confused by all the separate scenes each lasting but a few seconds. This made it seem an eternity before the Spitfire shot down the German bomber, and there was the damaged Spitfire, gliding and gliding. The huge budget provided for merely a few planes and a token number of rescue ships.How else was it spent? Plenty of noise, stupendous action, and very little acting or even dialogue. No, this war movie was disappointing to say the least.",5,4,7,5 August 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," British officer is used to incite Arabs against the Turks
","Ten it is and well deserved. I have seen this several times and always find something to dwell on. Of course, Peter O'Toole was superb, but so was his supporting cast. Anthony Quinn looks more Arabic than Arabs. And Anthony Quayle always has been a favorite of mine and Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins, Alec Guiness, and Jose Ferrar were splendid. The latter was appropriately dissolute as the Turkish officer who captured LawrenceThe photography was spectacular, the skyline, deserts, and battle scenes. There were just enough of the fighting. The opening air bombing, the attack on the train, the massacre of the Turkish column, and the final raid. What also was impressive was the relationship between Lawrence and the two Arab boys. All in all, a marvelous production that no one should miss.",10,3,5,25 January 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," WW! from a German soldier's viewpoint
","I was in high school when I first saw this great war film and I am now a senior, senior, citizen and have seen it a few more times. ALL QUIET remains right at the top of my list of outstanding war pictures. Here was a unique depiction of life in the trenches from an enemy point of view, a novel approach. Lew Ayres gives a memorable performance as Paul Baumer, the sensitive German soldier, and has a fine supporting cast. The vivid battles in the trenches remain in my thought, and though they lack the technological know how of today, are indelible.One of the most touching scenes is when Baumer kills the Frenchman in the shell hole and remorse overcomes him. Another tragic part is when his buddy is dying in the hospital and is visited by his comrades. A lighter scene is when the company has an over abundance of food due to its losses and the men become satiated. They are so comfortable that they are inclined to philosophize about the causes of war and its solution. When Paul loses his friend, his depression grows and his death at the hands of a sniper is a fitting end to it all. The remake, with Ernest Borgnine, was satisfactory, but could not approach the quality of the original which I often find to be true.",9,8,8,13 December 2016
Paths of Glory," A film based on the French army mutiny in WW1.
","One of the best war movies ever, and especially of WW1. Kirk Douglas has an especially fine performance as Col. Dax, and George Macready is simply terrific as the merciless and incompetent general ordering the attack. Adolphe Menjou shines as the crafty commanding general. The supporting cast is excellent also, particularly the condemned trio, J Turkel, Meeker, and Carey. One weak spot to me, was Wayne Morris who seemed miscast. I expected him to break out in a football cheer at any moment. However, he, too, gets his due when he is exposed as a coward.The battle scenes were good but were overshadowed by the the court martial , imprisonment, and execution. Especially touching, too, was the appearance of the young German girl singing in the the cabaret. The real corker was when Macready is exposed as the real culprit at the end.",9,1,3,15 January 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," A conscientious objector becomes a hero in World War II
","I could not help but think of the movie SERGEANT YORK when I saw this. Both were based on true stories, both had main characters who were deeply religious. The big difference was that York became a combat soldier and Doss, a conscientious objector and medic. HACKSAW RIDGE was the more touching of the two. Both were Medal of Honor winners, but it surprised me that I had never heard of Desmond Doss before viewing this movie.I am a fan of war films and I rate HACKSAW RIDGE quite highly, but not in the same category as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, PATHS OF GLORY, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and several others. The acting was good and the story well told. I find fault with the overemphasis on violent and gory images. More time should have been devoted to how Doss saved all those lives. A few other things bothered me like the scene showing the sergeant being pulled backward on a blanket mowing down the enemy. Also it was difficult to believe the order could not be given for the company to advance until Doss was finished praying.Well above average, yes, outstanding no.",7,1,8,8 November 2016
