Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Worst book to movie adaptation ever
","I created an account just to review this horrible movie, so maybe I could save some people from wasting the almost 2 hours it took to endure this wreck. I have read the book prior to seeing this, and literally 5 minutes in I was already appalled by the changes and regretting the money wasted on the tickets. The book is beautifully written, one that makes a hundred pages fly by, and even after your eyes hurt from the strain, you still want to go back for more. I was really looking forward to seeing how they would transform some of the powerful scene in the book to the silver screen. But unfortunately, not a single scene made it from the book to the projector. Only a few characters were kept from the book, and were only represented in name, none of their actions or their personalities made it through the Hollywood-ization. At one point Abe grows from a 30ish year old to a 50 year old in two minutes flat. As if there was no growth for him as a man, no substantial plot or character building happened during those years just *poof*: shopkeep to president, just like that. It just has to be the worst book to movie adaption ever made.",1,8,16,23 June 2012
