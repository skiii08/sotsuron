The Blair Witch Project," Breathtakingly Stupid!
","This movie was total cheese. It stank. This is the kind of true story that needs to be told in a regular-like movie based on a true story. There is absolutely nothing that is worth any good mention about in this movie. Breathtakingly stupid.I not only found it cheesy, but I also thought the following things about it: cheap documentary, bad directing, stupid scenes, stupid dialog ( there are other four letter words besides the f-word), bad photography images and no fantasy. Stupid Horror flick.If you have not seen this movie, don't even waste your time. It's not worth it at all. You probably find it just as stupid.Stupid, stupid and more stupid.",Null,1,3,30 September 2005
3:10 to Yuma," Excellent Movie! Ben Foster is the best act!
","I loved this movie. Normally I don't really care for Westerns, but this one is great. Being that Ben Foster is in it is the reason I like it as much as I do. He played his role of Charlie Prince phenomenally. He deserves an Academy, Oscar, and Golden Globe awards.Ben definitely did a better acting job then Russell Crowe. Oh and as for the message board comment by real emotion, there is no homosexual behavior going on here. The reason they look at each other is to make sure everybody where they are supposed to be. When they hug it is friendly hugging.Excellent Movie! 10/10 stars!",10,3,6,23 September 2007
Erin Brockovich," Excellent Movie!
","I thought this movie was excellent. Iam in the process of buying the DVD for myself. I love Erin Brockovich, and Julia Roberts. I also love Marg Helenberg. The following things were great about the film: Acting, Script, Costumes, Production, Lessons. I read Erin's auto-biography book, Take It From Me Life's A Struggle, But You Can Win. She has an awesome story to tell for anyone who has never read it and I recommend it.I don't think she got a fair deal after she was in that car accident. That asshole should have had to pay for every single piece of damage that he had done, I don't care how minor or whatever. Iam very happy that all plaintiffs in the Hinkley case got what they deserved. Kudos to the cast and crew and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!",10,0,1,21 May 2005
Monster," Bad Documentary and Drama
","I did not find anything that was worth mention about this movie. Bad acting, bad script, production was lame, bad directing, disturbing acts of behavior and too glamorized for what Aileen Wuornos did. The only good thing about it was the great acting performances by Christina Ricci and Charlize Theroen.Warning: Spoilers coming up!Aileen Wuornos, who they portrayed as sympathetic was not that way at all. She a nasty sociopath who by day seemed to be a charming law abiding citizen but by night was a monster prostitute and killer. She approached her clients by hitchhiking rides from them. Then once she had them in an isolated place, she had sex with them and killed them. I have no sympathy for her in terms of these killings, she was not incompetent or insane, she knew it was all wrong. Like the prosecutor said about her, 'She's not a robber who kills, She's a killer who robs'. There are plenty of people who have had tough lives who do not later go out and become psychopath killers, instead they go out and they become productive members of society. She deserved her punishment and I'm glad she got it.",1,14,35,16 July 2005
X-Men," Excellent and Interesting!
","I thought that this movie was excellent. I never thought much about seeing the X-Men movies until the third one came out. The reason why I decided to see it then was because one of my favorite actors the beautiful Ben Foster is in it.I think it is pretty cool of how the knifes and blades and spears come right out of the mutants whenever they want and need them to. The school that they went to for mutants was really just like an ordinary school. I thought the costumes and settings were wonderful.I also thought the acting was great, directing, photography and script. Two Thumbs Way Up! 10 out of 10 stars!",10,0,0,28 June 2006
The Polar Express," Excellent Movie!
","I found this to be an excellent movie. It's one of my favorite Christmas movies. 10 out of 10 stars. It has excellent acting, directing, costumes, production, photography, and script. Kudos to the cast, crew, and filmmakers.A young boy is awakened in the middle of the night on Christmas Eve by The Polar Express. He gets on and makes new friends. As they are on their way to the North Pole one of them loses her ticket when it blows out the window.They get to the North Pole a lot of cool things happen. Things such as rides where the presents are kept and when the boy is given a present by Santa he picks a bell, but he loses. The next day he finds it under the tree. The note on it says that Santa found it on his sleigh. Tom Hanks was excellent in this movie!",10,1,4,8 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Excellent Movie!
","This movie is excellent. I love it. I give it, 10 out of 10 stars. Everything in it is great, acting, costumes, production, cinematography, script, directing, and set decoration. The sky is awesome. All the other things were awesome too.In this installment Harry is sought and eventually found by his uncle and godfather Sirius Black, a man wrongfully imprisoned at Azkaban Prison for murdering 12 people. However, Harry and Sirius come to terms with their lost time and missed opportunities when they meet up with each other in the end. They discover that Peter Pettigrew is the true killer. Sirius escapes from Azkaban and has remained free ever since.My favorites parts are when aunt Marge blows up, the night bus, Hogwarts, etc.",10,0,2,5 February 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Ben Foster, made this movie excellent and the best of all three!
","10 out of 10 stars. This movie is made the best X-Men movie by Ben Foster as the new mutant Angel, a.k.a. Warren Worthington III. The acting was great, especially Ben's. The costumes were awesome, especially Ben's wings. I thought it was amazing that they could make them so big and make everything look so realistic.The mutants are in great danger in this one when Worthington Labs comes up with a cure to make mutants regular humans. In order for them to stay as they are they must escape and destroy this lab before it's too late. However, unfortunately several tragic events leading up to it occur.I also thought the following things were great: production, directing, script, music, plot, etc.",10,0,1,5 August 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Excellent Movie! Better Then The Original!
","I thought this movie was excellent and definitely a lot better then the original. I give it 10 out of 10 stars, Two Thumbs Way Up! Finally they made an updated version of it with more sophisticated technology.Everything in this movie is great, acting, costumes, production, script, directing, following of the book and many good lessons. Lessons in this movie include: being greedy is foolish, if you're spoiled and a brat no one will like you, it's disgusting to chew things all day long, there's other things to do besides watch t.v. and if you're nice and sweet good things will come your way.The things I like in this movie were the Chocolate Room, Nut Room, Glass Elevator, etc.Johnny Depp, also did a great and a lot better job then Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka!",10,6,11,26 July 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Excellent Movie!
","I loved this movie. This is one of the two best Harry Potter movies. The only thing is they don't show very much of Hagrid. I thought it was sad when Sirius died. He was a great godfather to Harry.I think that PG-13 is the right rating for this movie because it's a little bit more violent and has more intimate love scenes in it. It's a very enjoyable movie. Although if your child is under 12 don't take them.Great movie, great acting, great costumes, production, everything. The movie and book go together very well. It's great to see that everything is met here.",10,0,1,18 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Excellent Movie!
","I love this movie, it is excellent. Everything in it is, acting, costumes, production, directing, script, photography, set decoration, etc. Kudos to the cast, crew, and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up! 10 out of 10 golden stars. In this first installment, Harry Potter, an 11-year old boy learns that he is a wizard when Rubius Hagrid, the great big giant comes to get him. Then all the amazing things happen, such as, Diagon Alley, Platform nine and three quarters, Hogwarts Express, Hogwarts, Chess Game, Battle with Lord Voldermort. I love this movie.This is a great series, and will continued to be even more great as time goes by.",10,1,3,14 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Excellent Movie!
","This movie is excellent. I just saw it at the theater last night with nachos, cheese and spirit. It was excellent acting and production and costumes. The directing was good too.Although there are many great parts in this movie, my favorite is the prom scene. It was not very nice of that boy to stand up Hermione the way he did. Harry was lucky to have been on the royal court. I hate that one-eyed professor. He does so many nasty things, frames Harry for stealing Snapes potion mix, puts Harry's name in the Goblet Of Fire, puts Harry in danger and makes him come into contact with the Dark Lord Voldemort.Two Thumbs Way Up! 10 out of 10 golden stars. Two Thumbs Way Up!",10,0,0,29 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Excellent Movie!
","This second installment of Harry Potter is also excellent. It has all the exact same great things as the first. Kudos to the cast, crew, and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up! I give it 10 out of 10 golden stars.These are the great and amazing things that happen in this one, Dolby the house elf, Battle with the python and Tom Riddle, Moaning Myrtle, Etc. I also really liked it when Dolby caused the cake to spilled on Mrs. Mason's head. That was really funny.The Harry Potter movies just keep on getting better and better. I love them all. Keep 'em coming.The adventures are so exciting.",10,5,9,14 February 2006
Bring It On," Excellent Movie!
","This is an excellent movie with excellent, acting, costumes, directing, production, script storyline, music and lessons. The biggest lesson of all that it teaches is that winning is not whats important it's trying your best that is. The other biggest lesson of all that it teaches is that you should give everyone and anyone a chance no matter what.Spoiler WarningThe thing I find the most amazing about Torrenance is that she was not only willing to give everyone and anyone a chance, but she also encouraged Missy to join the squad. I love cheerleading and movies about it, and this is one of the best ones out there. Missy is an awesome cheerleader, who takes Carvert's place when she falls and breaks her leg during the school year's first cheerleading practice. I think that she was great as a cheerleader. Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!",10,6,7,12 July 2005
Carrie," excellent movie, with a useful important lesson!
","I thought this movie was excellent with an important lesson, so listen up and listen carefully. First I just wanted to say Sissy Spacek was excellent in her role as Carrie White. I will now post my lesson below.The things they do to Carrie in this movie are some of the most nasty things that I have ever seen. The locker room episode was beyond belief. There was no reason at all for throwing pads at her when she got her period, teasing her, doing whatever they damn well pleased to her and especially at the end which was the worse when they threw the buck of pig blood all over her. There is no justification in killing, however this movie does teach a good lesson to do unto others as you'd have done to you, which is the Golden Rule.",10,1,1,12 August 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Excellent Movie!
","This movie is excellent. It is one of my favorites. My future career is going to be working as a C.S.I., and Criminalist and Parole Board member. This movie has a lot things in it that are related to these things.The actors and actresses did a great job in this film, as did the filmmakers and other crew members. I hate those two physcopath Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill who skins his victims. These victims are young women who are a size 14. He also is a resemblance of Ted Bundy. That is he spots a woman ans puts his arm in a cast pretending he's injured and needs help. When they help him he attacks. Great Movie!",10,3,5,13 July 2005
X2: X-Men United," Great, but the First One is Better and the Third Will Be Too!
","This movie is great, but the first is better and I know the third will definitely be the best. I know this because the beautiful Ben Foster is going to be in it. Although, the great things about this movie must be written, costumes, acting, production, script, directing, storyline, plot, photography, etc.I just thought that things like them being stuck behind that ice block and boys and girls going into each other's rooms at night were stupid. I don't think that was appropriate to put in a movie that even younger kids will see. Next time make a better choice please.Although, overall it was a great movie that is worth seeing. I give it 8/10 stars. I would recommend it to anyone who likes these kinds of movies.",8,0,0,19 July 2006
