10 Cloverfield Lane," 'Misery' goes apocalyptic!
","What can I say about 10 Cloverfield Lane? Well, um..... Think the 90s film 'Misery' but far more terrifying with an apocalyptic setting and aliens. So more-or-less a crossover between 'Misery' and 'War of the Worlds'. If you don't like horror movies, this is CERTAINLY not your cup of tea, in understatement. I would be lying if this movie didn't have the potential to emotionally scar anybody for a long while. I mean, the guy who voiced Sully in 'Monsters Inc.' is in it, so that should take the edge off, right? Well knowing that lone fact only made the film MORE intense.There are only a handful of human characters seen in the film, one of which is our protagonist, Michelle, our on-and-off antagonist for the former 95% of the plot, Howard, and a secondary character acting as a friend to Michelle, Emmett. The acting was superb, and there was no apprehension in displaying both emotion and situational severity. Michelle and Emmett are both very well-written, and they displayed a very high degree of intelligence and cleverness as well. Howard's character is a bit more difficult to discuss, because his real motive was never really expanded-upon or made clearer than it actually was (on one-hand, he WAS trying to protect the other characters from the calamities outside his bunker, but he quickly became a lunatic whenever he is disrespected. But needless to say, he was absolutely crazy, and the writers did a terrific job in ensuring that he remain compelling, albeit frightening. Whenever he was on-screen, a general feeling of uneasiness just radiates off of the screen.As previously-stated, this film was beyond intense! It actually eclipsed the general levels of intensity that one would associate with the film 'Misery' (which, if you have seen that film before, is the same basic premise: an individual is injured in a car accident, they are taken into a refuge after being found, owner of said refuge is an on-and-off psychopath, injured individual formulates an escape method, etc). And it is for this reason alone that I will never see a film like this one again in theaters, despite it generally being an enjoyable/solid watch. There were jump scares present, but they just sort of 'occurred' for a lack of better words, and they took you by surprise with little or no buildup. For example, one can consider the moment where Howard shoots Emmett, in which case an argument between the two is supposedly resolved and then BOOM! There was a tad bit of suspense in there, but it wasn't exactly what one would define as a suspenseful film, rather a horrific thriller. Interestingly, the underlying plot is actually within Michelle's mind: does she desire to escape from Howard's clutches and risk exposing herself to the apocalypse outside which may or may not actually exist, or does she want to spare her life albeit within Howard's bunker where she is being held hostage? That alone was an intriguing plot- piece.What stole the show for me, however, were the extraterrestrials that showed-up at the very tail-end of the film (as in, the final ~5%). After dealing with Howard and taking her chances with a makeshift hazmat suit (that she and Emmett designed in efforts to create an escape plan), she exits the bunker at last, only to be met with a massive alien aircraft and what appears to be a worm-like quadruped just minutes later. This was perhaps the most drastic/sudden transformation in any plot that I have personally witnessed, and it was fantastic: one moment a character is escaping the clutches of a psychopath, and the next an alien scout is attempting to exterminate her. This is the very reason why this film can be described as '95% Misery, 5% War of the Worlds'. As a compilation of my thoughts, this was generally an enjoyable movie. But this said, the intensity level was too much for my liking, and I still cannot fathom that what I just watched was so terrifying. It is this reason that I would rate it a good 8/10.",8,0,2,20 March 2016
Doctor Strange," Marvel has done it again with an unusually-appealing acid trip
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!Marvel has done it again! Doctor Strange was a spectacular film that certainly deserves to be in the uppermost tiers of all existing Marvel Entertainment films. Though still lower on my 'ranking lists' than Civil War, Doctor Strange has proved yet again that Marvel Studios can, and still will for years and years to come, continue to make coherent single-universe films that are all individual stories by themselves yet still manage to connect to the greater encompassing cinematic universe.The greatest takeaway that I had from this film were the visuals, and I don't overstate anything here. The visual effects are, in my humble opinion, the most flattering and beautiful that I have seen in any Marvel film to-date (MCU or not). For such a 'strange' concept, nobody would have imagined that such overwhelming visuals and computer-generated effects would function as seamlessly as they did. One other thing that should be noted is that you really should avoid LSD before walking into the auditorium to see this film, however (but this is a good thing! Because it was all a gorgeous joy-ride!)Deriving from the visual effects comes the action. These action sequences were unique; the first of their kind. While there was still a lot of punching and kicking involved, the dependence on extraordinary magical/spiritual abilities adds a lot of sugar to the mixture in the best way conceivable. Watching the main characters literally flip cities dimensionally, conjure fantastical whips, and screw around with the concept of time in the midst of battle was quite a sight to see. Each and every one of the physical primary conflict sequences in the film fairly-surpassed anything I have seen from Marvel as of yet on a visual and spectacular level, and that is very-much a positive note.As per usual, this isn't a full review without mention of the characters. Stephen Strange's origin was very-much highly- reminiscent of Tony Stark and Scott Lang: beginning the film as a jerk with an inflated ego, he grows on a psychological basis as the film progresses and ultimately saves the day (surprise, surprise....). I did like his characterization a lot and look forward to seeing him more in Infinity War. The other main characters weren't exactly anything special, but they were passable. The Ancient One is calm and collected yet still badass, Mordo's development is setting the stage for future villainy, and Wong provided grounds for Strange's snark. Yet, among these characters, Kaecillius (the active antagonist of the film) wasn't a heck of a lot more fascinating than some of the other lesser-appreciated Marvel Cinematic Universe antagonists (these include Ronan, Yellowjacket, and Malekith to name a few), but he was very- much an exciting character to watch in combat, as his aptitude for 'flipping' the physical realm into convoluted and unearthly dimensions was an eye-opening sight to behold as Strange and co. fought against him. And finally, Kaecillius' presence paves the road for Dormammu: either the highlight or the subzero aspect of the film as varying opinions online and elsewhere are made vocal. While he can easily be mistaken for another Thanos (being deep-voiced and intent on consuming the Earth while manipulating beings of inferior power doesn't help), I thought he was an awesome addition to this already- pleasing movie. And what made his presence greater was the fact that, wait for it, he wasn't nerfed! He was portrayed as perhaps the most powerful MCU character at the moment, superior to even Thanos.So while still not quite up-to-par with Civil War, Doctor Strange was yet another fine installment in the MCU, to my delight. Really hopeful to see where this series goes in the future! It gets a 9/10 from me.",9,3,7,5 November 2016
Ant-Man," 'I want you to go into a place and steal some sh*t'
","Age of Ultron amazed me much more-so than any other movie had when I saw it in theaters, little did I know Ant-Man would do the same albeit to a much smaller extent and for different reasons. After seeing Ant-Man, it is most definitely within my top 5 Marvel Cinematic Universe films, tied with Winter Soldier at third place. It is a must-see for Marvel fans!The action is not quite as spectacular as that of many other Marvel films, but the shrinking dynamic that is utilized by both the hero and the villain alike was intriguing, especially when it was taken to a quantum level (known as the Microverse in canon). I would have preferred to see more clear and direct hand-to-hand combat as opposed to Scott punching-out opponents with ease at the miniature level, but the action was overall very pleasing. I would also like to state that the minor appearance of the Falcon was a very welcome addition to this film, which even includes a short fight scene! The final fight was pretty spectacular, even though it lacked what was seen in the Steve vs Bucky scenes in TWS in-terms of hand-to-hand combat, simply due to the fact that the usage of everyday items as weapons and the shrinking-growing concept in battle was done very well. Oh yea, and I really did appreciate the concept of the ants assisting and ordering to Scott.This was probably the funniest action film that I have ever seen! The little quips and jokes made those in the Avengers films look like something you would see in an episode of Spongebob. Unlike the humor in both Avengers movies, the humor in Ant-Man felt very fluent and seamless, and was remarkably hilarious to go along! My personal favorite scene of the 'funny' type would definitely have to be the inclusion of the Thomas the Tank Engine toy in the climax, which literally ballooned the previously hand-sized toy into an actual railroad (made even more funny with the fact that Thomas' eyes are still motioning around!).Other than the action and humor factors, there is not much else to discuss aside from the characters. They were all very humorous and enjoyable, and the villain (Darren Cross) was done very thoroughly, although he was oddly similar to Stane from Ironman back in 2008. That brings me to my next point that the Yellowjacket character itself did not appear until quite literally the third act of the film, which was very disappointing in my eyes, but not sufficient to kill my enjoyment of this film.I would have to give this movie a solid 8.5-9/10. Definitely see it, especially if you are a Marvel fan!",9,1,6,18 July 2015
Jurassic World," Good movie, but not great.
","Definitely good, but not great. The effects were average from what I can remember, and many of the action sequences had the same damn formula as what we have seen already THREE DAMN TIMES: raptors tackle the unlucky workers and slaughter them while the bigger theropods just gobble them up. That said, I really enjoyed the dino-on-dino scenes, especially the final confrontation between the tyrannosaurus and I-rex. Oh, and the death of the I-rex with the mosasaur dragging it under water was pretty damn awesome as well!The story was basic, and the characters were nothing special either save for Chris Pratt's character who was a total badass, not to mention that one scene where Claire started undressing on the waterfall, which in-short got pretty much every guy in the theater going (yep... That includes me!). The suspense, however, was pretty well-done, especially during the scenes lacking non-human creatures altogether.One last thing that I would like to say is that the humor in this was actually pretty damn funny. It didn't seem forced as in the MCU movies, and felt very naturally-occurring. In particular, there was the one scene involving the boys' British babysitter getting taken by the pterosaurs that could not get me to stop laughing! And of course there was the moment where that guy got friendzoned BAD.Overall, somewhere between 7-8.5/10. Decent movie, but not terrific. Didn't blow me away like Age of Ultron did, but met my expectations.",7,5,17,13 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," New favorite in the MCU!
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!OK so I am very critical of films. Guardians of the Galaxy, for example, was about a solid 6.5-7.5 out of 10 for me. But this film was PHENOMENAL! Easy 9.5/10, taking the place of my new favorite in the MCU, eclipsing both Winter Soldier at third and Ironman at 2nd.The action and effects were great, and the battles were extremely fun to watch. There were quite a few major fight sequences in the film, and they were all very well-done. That said, I do wish that the final fight would have been less similar to that of the climax of the first film: it was basically a huge mash-up of all of the heroes (this time, there were 9 of them as opposed to 6) tearing through tons of incredibly weak Ultron drones.The performances of the characters were much of the same save for one player, and that is Ultron, who is portrayed by James Spader. Not only is he very cool-looking and powerful, but his performance was absolutely top-notch, rivaling even the portrayal of Harry Osborn/Green Goblin in Amazing Spiderman 2 (as flawed as that film is, Osborn was acted very thoroughly). Easily my favorite villain in any Superhero film (the other MCU films included)! Although it would have been very nice to see him in combat more often, specifically during the final battle where he got shafted a lot like Loki did in the first film, not really doing as much as he could have been. And his ultimate death was not that impressive in the slightest.Another character that is often brought-up is The Vision, played by Paul Bettany. He was a very impressive character with a great performance, but I honestly fail to see what exactly made him stand-out so much from the rest of the Avengers, which, as I have said, were more-or-less the same execution-wise. As amazing as this film was, it still did have its flaws, one of which obviously includes Ultron's wasted potential. Some other gripes of mine include: misplaced/unnecessary humor (too much of it), everything moving far too quickly (the downfall of Strucker and HYDRA, the creation of Ultron, the rise of Vision, to name a few major pieces).Again, this film was TERRIFIC! 9.5/10 is my final rating, which is no easy task from me.",9,0,3,2 May 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Mess of a film with amazing action sequences
","SPOILER-FILLED REVIEW OF BATMAN VS SUPERMAN:So what can I say about Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice? Well first and foremost, it's a mess. That's the bottom line. Cool or not, the way the film was constructed made it seem as if they just threw certain scenes together effortlessly. But this said, it does have elements that make-up for the lack of value in the storytelling, at least to an extent.Man of Steel was very mixed in the responses, though I was luckily one of the moviegoers who actually appreciated it. And after seeing the Rotten Tomatoes rating for BvS drop to sub-35, I knew something was up. Yet I still remained excited and optimistic about seeing it. The film has flaws, and a lot of them. They are especially prominent in the method by which the story is told: the piecing-together of scenes is barely sequential until the final act, and it quickly stoops to the level of inducing boredom. You try to acknowledge the fact that these were still moments complimenting the story, and you do your best to enjoy them, but all of this wishful thinking ultimately fails. The writers beat the 'Superman = bad' idea to a pulp, and you could barely care about it until our two main heroes (later becoming three) confront one-another. Oh, and the 'Batman fighting Superman' premise is merely a sort of 'debate' until a small but sweet sequence prior to the climax. Another issue with the film is that it was very difficult to become invested in any of the characters save for Lex Luther, as great as the acting was in general. Bruce Wayne and Alfred had a few neat moments, but otherwise nothing stood-out. They were just... bland; nothing more, nothing less. Clark and Lois were thrown to the side and did not feel significant in the least for the former two acts of the film. When taking the role of civilians, there was next to nothing intriguing about the primary protagonists in the plot; this said though, their roles as individual, separate superheroes was developed very well and was immensely satisfying.Mentioned earlier was Lex Luther, who was actually a generally more exciting antagonist than what he has been given credit for, actually receiving loads of criticism in regards to his performance and dialogue. To be honest, this couldn't be further from the truth: rather, he is the only character that I actually cared about in non-action moments, and his plan overall just oozed of anticipation. His use of General Zod's lifeless body to concoct a biological weapon, Doomsday, was a fantastic plot point. Doomsday's design was neat, though his face looked very troll-ish and awkward; but all this information known, he was still an excellent addition to the film, and he was a tremendously terrifying creature that was also accurately-portrayed as reeking of raw power. Something else that is noteworthy is the sheer fact that this film did everything in its power to set-up the Justice League arc later in the DCCU, through both brief glimpses of the other heroes and, more importantly, references of Darkseid (which even Luther himself alludes to at the end).Now to the film's expense, there is a scarcity of action, well at least this holds true up until the massive third act. But in the scenes that did involve fighting, the film just boomed with amazement. With a solid conjunction of great choreography and beautiful effects, this would make sense. Batman's fighting was crisp and satisfying, as did the suit look stunning, and his use of his gadgets was, from recollection, neatly-written. And the penultimate fight with Superman was small in-scale but sweet: it wasn't particularly a spectacle to watch, but it was decently-choreographed, despite being slow. But the final fight against Doomsday was downright gorgeous, both visually and physically. This was hands-down one of the coolest climactic battles I have ever witnessed in a film! Marvel needs to step their game up in their future films to stand-up to this sequence!In the realm of action sequences, this film really did it! It did not fail to excite me more for the future of the DCCU. But in the department of editing and the overall composition of the film, it is an uneventful collage of scenes that could have been reworked to create a better movie. Awesome, but very flawed. 6/10",6,3,6,25 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not a Star Wars fan, but still loved it nonetheless
","So to knockout any confusion, yes, I have seen the other Star Wars movies, but only a handful of times. The prequels and originals alike I have seen, but not very many times. That said, The Force Awakens was truly spectacular!To begin, you did have many throwbacks to the original trilogy including the addition of characters from said trilogy; I would assume this to be a very welcome feature for the real Star Wars lovers in the world, so ultimately that remains a positive factor of this film. And yes, Han Solo does get killed by Kylo Ren, which I thought felt just a little rushed to be honest: there was not much buildup to it despite Han being such a major character in the Star Wars film franchise.This leads into the characters, which were generally written and portrayed by their actors very well. This time around, they actually felt like human beings and not robots standing in front of a green screen as with the prequels. While the only initial Jedi in the film was Luke Skywalker (who actually shows up very briefly at the tail-end of the movie), the female lead, Rey, discovered her sensitivity to the force about halfway into the film and became a true Jedi during the final confrontation with Kylo Ren. I appreciated this addition, because you finally get a human female Jedi (who can be taken seriously!), and it was an unexpected yet vital transformation (you had no clue going-into the film that she even possessed sensitivity to the Force). The trailers lead you to believe that Finn is the main protagonist/hero, but he gets tossed to the side without much effort by Ren in the final lightsaber duel, giving Rey the opportunity to take the lightsaber.Kylo Ren and the other major antagonists were fantastic! Though he may appear to be just a basic Darth Vader clone, Kylo Ren barely fit the bill here, even when taking into consideration his helmet and costume design in the film (VERY reminiscent of Darth Vader from the original trilogy). Rather, his villainy was written very differently, and he was much more aggressive in behavior (specifically, there was one moment where he hits the berserk button and tears apart a control module with his lightsaber. So while he was perhaps an overly-aggressive antagonist, he was by-no-means cheesy). This film appears to be setting up the sequels in a similar manner to the OT, as Kylo Ren is explicitly the heavy villain driving the plot in TFA, but is just a lackey to a greater threat, who, in this new trilogy, is known as Supreme Leader Snoke, who holds the appearance of a deformed reptilian species of a sort (not to mention that he is an obvious expy of the Emperor from both the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy).Unlike the films in the prequel trilogy, lightsaber presence in The Force Awakens was very limited/conservative. From my recollection, I believe only two showed-up in the whole movie (the blue one that Finn and Rey wield and of course the very distinctive red lightsaber belonging to Ren). Unfortunately, this does in-fact mean directly that there was only one lightsaber duel in the whole film, which was the final conflict between Ren, Rey, and Finn. However, I must add that this was one fantastic fight sequence, done less in the vein of the fights in the prequels, which were more flashy on an unnecessary level (rather it was more similar to what you would see in the original trilogy). But in regards to the ship battles, they were much of the same, yet were still generally entertaining to watch. One should also make note that the effects, most notably the visual effects, were improved vastly from the prequels.For not being a huge Star Wars fan, this movie was great! It certainly captured the true meaning/essence of Star Wars. 9-9.5/10 for me!",9,2,15,21 December 2015
Godzilla," Great effects and awesome monsters!
","So I actually saw this movie twice, one last night and one earlier today. The first time I saw it, the film was hard to understand/follow, and the action/monsters were basically the only thing that I paid attention to. Here is my review WARNING, SPOILERS:To start, this movie was awesome! It really captured the true essence of the Japanese Godzilla but with enhanced effects. This is the first true American Godzilla film! The best parts of the film were, of course, the monsters. But not only that, the CGI done to create them was amazing and realistic! Godzilla was very realistic as well, and looked like a sort of hybrid between the Heisei Godzilla (after 1985) and Godzilla 2000 with the origins of the 1954 version; he was awesome! As for the Mutos, they were very unique and fierce too, looking very alien-like in appearance. They looked a lot more rugged and scary than both Godzilla and the Pacific Rim kaiju alike. The Mutos were badass! And the final fight was epic and brutal at the same time, and was very natural in movement as opposed to most of the Toho fights.I felt that the plot and acting is being overlooked. The acting is not really THAT bad, and that is coming from one who does not care much about the acting. The scene in Janjira was tear- jerking and very intense, but well-done at the same time. After that, the acting does not mean as much.And for the plot, it was simple, but yet quite well-done to be honest. It gave the Mutos and Godzilla a strong connection.Overall, it was an EPIC film. Although, as with me, your first viewing might not get the message through due to the intensity of the film, the second viewing at least is awesome!",9,5,12,17 May 2014
Deadpool," Decent Action, Overwhelming Presence of Dull Sex Jokes
","Finally I had the time to see Deadpool last night, and it was far from what one could define as a 'great movie', or even a great superhero movie at that. It wasn't a BAD film, but it did not impress me in anything beyond the action choreography and the overall design/formation of the Wade Wilson/Deadpool character.Wilson as a character was relatively well-developed, and he did have a somewhat entertaining sense of humor. But that said, I only remember giggling maybe about 5 or 6 times at any of the intended humor that was presented before the audience (coming from Wade or otherwise), and only about twice do I remember actually LAUGHING. He kept beating a dead horse with the infinite sex jokes, and eventually they grew tiring.But I would also like to add that the design of the cinematic Deadpool costume was very thoroughly-done, and that I appreciated. It WAS Deadpool through and through. And that is failing to mention that it looked gorgeous on-screen (in action sequences or otherwise). Oh, but I would like to add that Colossus and Warhead were kind of 'just there', and added nothing of real interest to the film.The story and antagonists that came with were both, I dare say, weak. There were definitely a few heavier/more satisfying moments in regards to the plot (Wade being diagnosed with terminal cancer and the emotional impact that left on himself and his friends, which included his love interest), but the storyline was bland and uninteresting in general. Wilson is diagnosed with supposedly incurable cancer, Ajax promises that he will cure him, Ajax mutates him during the operation which leaves him hideous and looking like 'Freddy Krueger and a topographical map of Utah', Wilson despises Ajax for what he has done to his face/body and decides to hunt him down in an act of revenge. Believe me, this plot does not come remotely close to being executed as how it is read (in other words, it sounds more intriguing when you read the synopsis, but ultimately it is poorly- executed in-film). And with that comes Ajax (the primary antagonist) and his lackeys, which can all be described identically as the plot: boring and unoriginal. In other recent superhero films, the antagonists have successfully stolen the show for me, and I always end-up disappointed when they receive less screen time than I initially anticipated; but with 'Deadpool', they possess zero intriguing qualities that only intensify the bland mood of the already underwhelming plot. Action/fighting-wise, all I can say is that it was very pleasing, and rightfully gory/disgusting. Not much else to say save for the fact that the action-based scenes were generally fun to watch.Should I give it a score, I think a 6.5/10 is appropriate. Not a bad superhero film, but it has it's fair share of flaws. These include: over-saturation of sexual jokes, failing to make me laugh throughout, and boring side-characters/antagonists coming with a storyline as flat as the state of Nebraska.",6,7,20,21 February 2016
