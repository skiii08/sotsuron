Airlift," Plot
",A truly aggressive movie. Firstly my regards for making real story so successful..hats off to cast. timing of songs.. hats off to the writer contributing to the screenplay - heart of the movie. As the movie reached last 30min i had no work than to control the tears rolling down my eyes.. The moment the office lifted the Indian Flag onto the building.. wow.!!! Not a single fight. no romance scenes.. no satirical dialogues. in one sentence. showed how various sections of people react in only mood to save their lives.. and later realize that they are to be unite.. Akshay Kumar deserves a applaud.. THIS IS WHAT INDIANS ARE WHEN THEY DECIDE TO HELP. AN Indian MOVIE..!!!!,10,5,8,24 January 2016
