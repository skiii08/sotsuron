The Hangover," best comedy ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","this movie is officially the funniest and best comedy i have ever seen. I've never seen a movie that throughout the movie every at most 2 minutes i wouldn't laugh.firstly i'm not gonna tell you any funny parts or quotes in the movie because its not fair 4 you but it wouldn't make much difference if i told you 5 or 6 parts because there is so many funny parts its hard to think of them.Basically it beats all of my past favourite comedy's by Judd Apatow although he is a genius in himself, he just does not beat this movie. all my past favourites like superbad (my 2nd favourite comedy), knocked up, forgetting Sarah Marshall nd i love you,man just are not as funny. it is very hard 2 admit but it is simply just the best comedy ever if not in my top 5 movies of all time.A MUST SEE nd A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9,5,8,12 June 2009
