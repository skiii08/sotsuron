Hereditary," Thrills with camera and BGM - Not the story !
","Movie revolves around a family where the exipired grand mother was a satanist and how the entire family get affected by this. The movie might get us on the edges with the awesome work of camera movement with the background music. With some real good performances from the artists, it is an average horror with rookie continuity errors and unortodox script with an inconclusive end.",7,0,0,15 April 2020
Creed," Worth watchy for the music and performances !
","There is always a first thing that comes to your while the movie ends, the very first thing that came to my mind was one of the sound track. The movie is revolves around a 'orphaned bastard child' by one of the late most famous boxer. However not portraying the transitions of the angry young child to a self made aspiring boxer is a major betrayal to script and the reason I believe for not creating a major impact on the audience. The female lead character Bianca, seriously? Slam the door on hero-----Go out for a dinner----Sleep with him---One encouraging dialogue--fight-One loud cry in climax. Olive in Popeye does more than this! The two main characters Adonis and Rocky had a huge scope of acting with the action and both actors have grabbed the most of it. Having the support of a sport in the play, the movie doesn't disappoint at the end.",7,0,4,9 December 2015
The Shining," May be a good thriller back that time ..
","With the low frequency string, the movie start on a family with a deliberate husband searching for job hoping that will give the isolation and environment for his writing with a homemaker wife and a little son who talks to his own calling to a character Tony. The casting for the wife is a interesting one. The cast makes the character is physically weak, and not of a great beauty that adds to the disinterest of Torrance in his life. The conversation between the couple shows her as always trivial with Torrance making her puny. When this family goes to a isolated hotel for maintaining it through out the winter which already has spooky history. During the period Torrance turns insane and attempts to murder his own family. But there is no real shots or space in the script that shows the change in the character of him, how insanity acquired him with the isolation and obsession on his writing. The concept of shinning that was fresh in the movie and having a positive ending with determinant Wendy Torrance character are aspects that can looked on the movie .",6,1,4,21 July 2014
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Height of imagination with power leads to belief !
","The story is really a very different kind of high imagination. Imagination is the heart of story telling. Mostly in movies it is seen in movies of Animation and Fictional genre. But this is movie does not belong to both of those categories. A journalist with the bored life and a disinterested wife decides to take some thing adventurous in his life and attempts entering Iraq. In the course he meets couple of people who worked for Black Ops in the past and claim to have psychic powers upon which they were trained upon. He meets Clooney in the attempt to go to Iraq and then he explains the whole thing that happened previously to him when he was in the New Earth Army which was responsible for the psychic power development in soldiers. And when it was used to kill a goat, Lyn (Clooney) believes their is curse laid on them. He wanted to expose all the things that happened to the world and thinks the journalist would do the job for him. He takes him to place where the psychic power research was still being done and headed in the wrong way in Iraq. He shows him that and frees all the animals and soldiers who were imprisoned there, and leaves. Definitely the performances of George Clooney,Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey is outstanding, and the most appealing part of the movie to me was 'Most of this is true than you would believe'.",6,1,3,28 June 2014
Gone Girl," Worth to add in your classic watchlist
","Without having read the book, the movie was just awesome through out except ... The positives are the characters of the movie, they all are very powerfully written. The to say the writer/director had succeeded in what they wanted. They wanted to hate Nick for some time, the audience did it, they wanted to hate Amy then , well the audience did so. Well, I can can say they had the complete emotional control over .There are few places of doubts where we might feel that there was not proper justice done. For example , the detective asks about the gun and Amy fades out. Afterwards the complete department seems to forget that something ever happened. May be justification to 'Amazing Amy' was a bit less on the screen. The ending is very debatable, but I feel it's very apt. With the uncertainty of Nick at that point of time, he couldn't break it in the interview and He wouldn't kill her for sure. The secret of making the audience ask and expect something and you half give it - impacts more !except ... the surveillance camera in Neil Patrik's home, what happened to it? It might contain times when Amy acted happy with him or the time when she entered. Amy is intelligent enough to murder in a blind spot, but not all of the events .",8,0,6,27 November 2014
Peaceful Warrior," Movie that touch you by lines
","This is an average movie considering the plot and narration. But it scores with the lines which are so honest, sharp and brutal. The movie is different from the conventional movies in having the Socrates character along with his own conscience character that haunts him. The ideas by the Socrates are never spoon fed or rushed through. It is a modern art exhibited to Millman (so as to us) is much like a modern art where someone can take what ever you want and some of it can be similar to the creator's.Even though the lines are excellent, it doesn't take us into the world of Socrates or Millman which why we the film doesn't attach to someone watching. But it's worth watch for inspirations like living the moment and rising from the fallen!",8,0,1,5 July 2015
Deadpool," Movie to chill and laugh it out ! ;)
","It's been sometime where there was a movie u go, watch and enjoy and not to think about too much. This is one such movie where the mood that is required for the movie (Relax and enjoy buddy mood) is set by the end of title cards! 'directed by -an overpaid tool' :D As much as hilarious with the black comedies for a parody, it also contains elements for making a story line unlike many other movies failed to do. Most of the voice over's interacting with the audience did work but few of them where very anticipatable(But who cares :P ) . But overall whether or not you are a comic lover, this is a movie that you can laugh out, enjoy and relax watching this movie. Not the one you would want to miss !",8,4,14,15 February 2016
