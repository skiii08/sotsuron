The Devil's Advocate," It's a good movie. Scary and enjoyable at the same time!
","'The Devil's Advocate' is another one of those devil movies, like 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Omen', and 'The Exorcist'(which I thought was very good).  But 'Devil's Advocate' is very enjoyable.  And although it's very scary at some times, this movie was a lot of fun to watch, and maybe learn from.  It reuses the idea from 'The Exorcist'; the devil is going to take possession of someone, in order to lure and possess the ones most vulnerable to him.  However, 'The Exorcist' was extremely serious and very tough to deal with after you finished watching it!  'Devil's Advocate' has a little change of heart.  It has the cool Al Pacino as the devil, and Keanu Reeves as his victim.   But instead of torturing him, Pacino simply showers him with gifts, money, and of course, women.  The women in this story weave a tapestry of irresistible temptation, which is why I think it had all the nudity in it.  And Al Pacino looks like he's having the time of his life. Pacino is usually serious in his films, but now, he's playing his role with guesto.  The only problem is, Keanu is taking this all too seriously.  He needs to lighten up a bit and attack Pacino with gusto right back.  His overacting makes him seem more vulnerable to Pacino, and to some, less likable.  But the real seriousness of the film is how Keanu proves the 'guilty' not guilty.  It's horrifyingly true!  We live in a nation where rapists, suspected murderers, and other sickos can weasel their way out of conviction!  And worse yet, the people who are innocent are shafted and at a disadvantage, while the lawyers and criminals can get to the top of a mega-corporation.  We see it in insurance companies, where people go through 'drive-in' health care, and the insurance managers are millionaires as a result.  It's sickening and morally wrong!  But in our country, we can get away with it!  And people like that, who is symbolized by the Keanu Reeves character, are going to come face to face with the devil in the future! That is my interpretation of it.  I highly recommend this film!  Though I warn you, there might be a few differences in the versions of the film you rent, and the versions of the film you decide to buy.  What I mean is, an ominous statue with people in it, which is seen in Pacino's penthouse, plays a key role in emphasizing the lustful temptation of Keanu.  But, the statue itself is an unauthorized reproduction of sculptor Frederick Hart's art! Hart sued, and in order to release the film on video, they released it as it was in the theatre, and eventually, re-edited the statue for the final video release.  I think that the impact of the statue wasn't as powerful, judging from the fact that the re-edited statue has no people in it!  Luckily, I purchased it on disc at the right time, before the editing took place.  Try to get the original if you can, and enjoy 'The Devil's Advocate'!",7,1,2,18 February 1999
The Blair Witch Project," The scariest film I have ever seen, or probably ever will see!
","First off, anyone who says this movie is okay, bad, or 'just plain sucked', obviously is full of shit or needs serious psychiatric help!  This film may not be the most memorable horror film ever made, but it doesn't have to be memorable to be scary.  'Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' were memorable, yes. But were those motherf*****s scary?  I don't think so.  I am delighted that I have seen this film, yet at the same time, enraged at the negative criticism people have wrote at the IMDB!   Do you guys think you could make a better or scarier movie?  I'll believe it when I see it.  Anyway, on with my review of 'The Blair Witch Project'.I honestly can't remember a time in my life where a film managed to scare me this deep into submission.  What makes this film so scary?  Well, for one thing, it's VERY realistic.  As a matter of fact, the actors truly suffered. They were deprived of food, as well as the knowledge of the fact that the directors themselves, were making the 'Blair Witch' noises at night.  They were fooled, and the result was the capture of authentic reactions of fear on camera.  The next stroke of genius was the camerawork.  What you are seeing is supposed to be the unearthed footage of the doomed filmmakers. So, instead of paying for a cinematographer, why not give the actors the cameras.  It's their story.  They're the ones who shot the footage that was found.  Sure the camerawork is shaky.  But it's real, nonetheless.  Also, this was the first horror film I've seen that could scare you to death, without the aid of gore, special effects, music, or even a monster.  If you are deaf, or hard of hearing, then you won't be scared by 'The Blair Witch Project' whatsoever.  You never see the 'Blair Witch', but you can hear it. There are moments in the film, where the lenscap is on, or it's just too dark to see anything, yet you can still hear, loud and clear, what is transpiring.  I cannot describe the sounds heard by the three filmmakers. The first one is merely some twigs breaking, but the other ones are combinations of moaning and babies crying.  Whatever it was, it managed to speed up my heart rate!  Scarier still, there is little doubt in my mind that these events couldn't really happen!  I think that is the heart of the nightmare, that it could happen to you!  I've always been scared of woods, and I could've sworn on my last camping trip, that I heard something walking around outside my tent.  'The Blair Witch Project' brings out that phobia of darkness and the woods out of every person that sees it.  Even before I saw this film, I was scared to walk around outside my cottage at night(which is out in the country).  Does this fear worsen?  Unfortunately for the squeamish, yes!  It builds up to an unbelievable climax until something hits the camera, and complete silence fills the woods.  It's inconclusive, which is again, aiding the fright factor, because it makes you think and wonder, what did you just witness, and what happened to the three missing filmmakers?  It's a terrifying ending, and it's one I'll never forget!  I've had nightmares similar to this.  Everybody does at one point in their lives. The directors knew that.  They also knew that this kind of buildup of fear would give 'The Blair Witch Project' it's life.  You are not going to get anything else from this film.  Not message, not euphoria, not sadness, nothing!  Just a hardcore scare, that never leaves you! NEVER!",10,2,3,27 July 1999
Scarface," Argueably one of the greatest crime movies ever made!
","'Scarface' is probably the best crime movie ever made.  I was unsure of what to make of it before I finally sat down and watched it.  It seemed like a long mafia epic.  It is long, but never boring, and it's not quite a 'mafia movie', like you would expect from films like 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas'.  It's more about the drug underworld that shoots people, or low life scumbags on top of the world, before swallowing them up in destruction.  I have read that this is a remake of 'Scarface', which came out in the 1930's.  I have absolutely no interest in seeing that version, because it's impossible to top Al Pacino's 'Tony Montana'!  Pacino and director Brian De Palma make an excellent filmmaking team, and luckily we got to see them work again in 'Carlito's Way'.  'Scarface' is not only a brilliant film, it's EXTREMELY realistic, and I mean extreme!  I also have read that there was a battle between Brian De Palma and the MPAA over the film's realistic violence.  You know what though, if the MPAA did in fact censor 'Scarface', they failed in succeeding to lessen the impact the movie has on it's audiences.  They could take out as much violence as they wanted to, and I still think that the power of 'Scarface' would remain the same.  I only wish I could see a film like 'Scarface' on the big screen.  That would be so awesome!  It's too bad that movies on a long, epic scale as 'Scarface' are rarely made anymore.",Null,0,0,6 October 1999
Alien 3," Actually, this isn't as bad as it's been made out to be.
","'Alien 3' is probably the most depressing and darkest film of the 'Alien' series, but don't hold that against it.  Many people did hold that against it, and many people, including the filmmakers, said that this film was a mistake gone horribly out of control.  I just think that it was time to bring the 'Alien' series to a close.  It also gives us a strong feeling of grief, as well as the strength to try and recover from that grief.  It is also brilliantly crafted.  The sets are dark, greasy, and horribly bleak; a perfect hiding place for a feisty little alien.  And the acting isn't bad either.  It stays serious and scary, keeping in spirit with the previous alien films.  To be honest, I used to hate this film.  I didn't understand it, and I thought the whole thing was a mistake that never should have been put onto film.  However, the 'Alien' film that followed this, 'Alien Resurrection', turned me around 180 degrees.  'Alien Resurrection', now that sucked!  It is a real reason for a person not to like the 'Alien' series. 'Alien 3' was depressing, yes, but unlike 'Alien Resurrection', it remained faithful to the 'Alien' series.  Now there's a reason to like and appreciate 'Alien 3'!",Null,0,3,11 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good movie? Yes. Good STAR WARS movie? No!
","Before I take this movie apart, I will say this.  I thought it was very enjoyable, it was action packed, and was a dazzling visual achievement! It's really a lot of fun as a movie alone.  This is actually a really good movie!  However, there is one thing wrong with it.  They are calling this part of the 'Star Wars' saga!  Once you've seen the film, and you think about it, it's just not possible to compare this to any of the previous films.  Not because the characters were different, because whoever said that we knew who Han Solo and Luke Skywalker were when the first 'Star Wars' film first came out?   But, for a lot of other reasons, and the characters can also be attributed to the many flaws in this prequel.First of all, I got the impression that the characters were undeveloped, overhyped, and written entirely for the sole purpose of marketing and selling action figures and toys.  For example, they hyped up the satanic looking Darth Maul for quite some time now, as this incredible and despicable villain.  He was only in the film for about 5 minutes!  I don't think Darth Maul was so bad, because I hardly got to know him.  He just sort of came and went.  I honestly thought that they could have done so much more with him, as they could have done with the overall film itself.  Although I like Liam Neeson very much in this film, because he is so commanding, serious, reverent, and never afraid.  They need more characters like him in this movie.  There were millions of opportunities open for character development and storyline fulfillment, yet nearly all of them were bypassed for time, or as my brother and I saw it, to market all of the ships and creatures that took up(or plagued) the 2 hour episode.And speaking of creatures, that is my real vendetta and overall upset with the film.  The creatures are childish and ugly, or as my sister saw it, racist and stereotypical.  One can only stand the astonishingly annoying Jar Jar Binks for a while, before contemplating his horrible murder!  And the race, which is a sci-fi chariot race, has a two-headed ESPN announcer! What the hell?  It's almost as if they were trying to spoof the 'Star Wars' saga! C-3PO's presence in this film is implausible too, because it just seems so unlikely that C-3PO was the droid of Darth Vader as a boy, and that he bounced around the galaxy in the wars long enough to eventually land back on Tattoine and become Luke Skywalker's droid.  R2-D2 and the lightsabers are the only semblance to the original films.As far as mythology goes, it's gone!  The force has been clarified as some sort of bacteria certain people contain in their cells, and Anakin Skywalker is some kind of 'Immaculate Conception'.  It's no longer 'Star Wars'. It's an overly 'eager to please' film that tries to satisfy the audience by trying to do and give everything away at once, instead of letting the saga conduct itself into the further films as it did with the original trilogy.And originality is an issue here too, because after the release of the 'Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition', which I thought ruined many of the already powerful scenes of the original films, it seemed like the 'Special Edition' was a bad omen for the upcoming prequel.  The prequel was going to be unsatisfying, overly childish, and swamped with gloppy creatures that get intolerably annoying after a while.  Indeed, my predictions were correct. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, far from it!  And it's certainly something not to be missed.  However, when you try comparing this to the original trilogy, you will realize that this simply doesn't measure up to what is expected of a 'Star Wars' film.  And if you are a hardcore fan of the 'Star Wars' saga like me, you are in for a MAJOR disappointment!",Null,0,1,25 May 1999
The Ring," The danger of remakes.
","Scariest film ever seen?!  What?  You've obviously never heard of the original Japanese film, 'Ringu', since it's unavailable in the U.S. Therefore, as with most American remakes of foreign films that are little or unknown in the U.S., the remakes, or shall we say, ripoffs get all the credit for things like 'originality, creativity, innovation'.  Haven't you ever heard of 'COPYING'?  *SPOILERS AHEAD!*With the exception of Naomi Watts, who makes the protagonist shine in the film, this remake essentially copies the Japanese film note for note and adds some silly embellishments of it's own to try and make it scarier, when all it does is teeter on farcicality and overkill.  In the original, the victims die with a horrified look on their face, as if they died seeing their absolute worst fear.  In the remake, they also die with a contortion on their face, but with a melodramatic touch by giving the dead victims corpse-rot so grandiose, you wonder how someone could've died like that. Well, only in a Hollywood flick you can, whereas the original without the added effects are infinitely more frightening in that they are BELIEVABLE. There are no little segments with the fly being lifted from the TV set in the original, which was a nice touch but seemed a bit gratuitous.  The scenes where the father commits suicide in the bathtub and the horse jumps off of the boat are completely over the top and therefore, fail to scare. There are no session videotapes with the little girl, which were inserted in the remake because Hollywood felt that American audiences were too 'dumb' to think for themselves and figure out through inference that the ghostly little girl's intent was one of evil.  And last but not least, is the video itself.  The big-budget ups the estrogen by giving the video all kinds of weird extra visuals, such as people writhing in water, a woman falling off of a cliff, a rope coming out of a mouth, and on and on until it becomes an artsy-fartsy freak show.  The original video, on the other hand, focused on a few images, some really frightening sounds, and instead of hearing a pseudo-scary little girl's voice saying '7 days' in the remake, you simply hear those scratching scary sounds on the videotape over the phone in the original.However, the similarities between this remake and the original are so similar, they may as well be exact!  For instance, the photograph with the warped faces on it, taken right out of 'Ringu', note for note.  The well with the little girl, the structure of the video, and the hair drawn in front of her face and wearing the nightgown as she walks to the TV zombielike before coming through the TV, and the actual story itself and how it progresses....what else can I say?  This is the danger of remakes.  If the film is well known and known to be a remake, then fine and dandy.  But, because Hollywood takes obscure foreign films that no one has ever heard of, it gives them not only reign to steal as much as they like from the films, but it draws the average viewer in and snows them into thinking they're seeing something that's original and new. They don't realize that what they're seeing is a fraud and a scam.  The sad thing is, there is also such a thing as a good remake, one that can withstand the original in it's own unique way rather that rip off of it. The most this remake does is tries to amplify what was already done in the original with messy results.  The original was frightening in that it focused on particular fears with sound and imagery, while this remake simply tries to do too much and pulls itself apart.There is a place for this remake, but don't dare call it the best horror film you've ever seen without having seen what it stole from.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
Chinatown," One of the most excellent films in the history of motion pictures!
","'Chinatown' is a film that you draw more from with each viewing.  And in turn, it becomes better with each viewing.  I recently had the pleasure of watching a 25th Anniversary screening of 'Chinatown' on the big wide Panavision screen.  There, it was as if I were seeing it for the very first time!  I was fully absorbed within the confines of the film.  It was absolutely incredible.  Now, I am proud to call myself a happy owner of the 25th Anniversary DVD release of 'Chinatown'.  After watching the DVD, I finally feel like I fully understand all of the minute details and subplots leading up to the explosive climax of 'Chinatown'.  I can also see how 'Chinatown' is talking about the world we live in today, in a sense that in a world that is corrupt and laden with deceit and mystery, a hopeful outcome will never be.  And more wisely spoken still, it is better that we forget about it all and stay out of it.  'Forget about it Jake, it's Chinatown'. The meaning is a metaphor for every person's life in the world today.  It's unfortunate, but that's life!  'Chinatown' has been labeled as a classic example of the film noir genre.  I wouldn't call it such.  Film noir is something like 'The Third Man' or 'The Killing', in which absolutely nothing good comes out of a situation and for no good reason.  'Chinatown' had reason, and it was more of a puzzle than simplistic film noir, unraveling and unraveling until there was nothing left but the message in the climax of 'Chinatown'.  I loved it!  It was the first time that I really felt influenced, inspired, and deeply affected by a film.  It was really riveting.  The only exception to this being a really great film was the most typical Hollywood cliche that has placed films like James Cameron's 'TITANIC' into the category of pure absurdity and stupidity.  I'm talking about how the characters know each other for a day or two, and already find each other having sex.  They do this sex thing in every movie, and why? Life doesn't happen that way, unless you are a complete sleazebag.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I highly recommend this to someone who wants to see a film that toys with our interests and our intellect like a great riddle or a puzzle.  I also think it is a film that will change your life forever!",Null,1,4,17 December 1999
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Absolutely hilarious!
","'Life of Brian' is the kind of comedy that Monty Python is known for, which is taking a subject and tearing it apart by making fun of it!  This time, they're making fun of the Christians(not Christianity, mind you), and reflecting how insidiously silly it is for them to mistake a simple man as the awaited messiah!  It also makes way for some of Monty Python's funniest jokes which have had me laughing until it started to hurt!  Although I'm amazed that they've got away with as much as they did, because after 'The Last Temptation of Christ', people are ready to jump on the bandwagon of brutally attacking a film that may seem controversial in it's religious subject matter.  But still, it's hard to attack this movie when it paralyzes you with laughter!  It's not as funny as some of Monty Python's other movies, but this is still very funny.  I couldn't believe the ending, with 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life'.  Eric Idle really pulled out all of his gags in this picture, and I think his best scene is as the worker with the speech impediment.  I thought that was one of the funniest scenes in the movie!  So if you're in a bad mood and you need something to cheer you up, look on the bright side of life and watch this hilariously funny film!",Null,1,4,2 June 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Can you say 'overrated'?
","After 'Shakespeare in Love' won almost every nomination, and beat 'Saving Private Ryan' for Best Picture, I decided I had to see it.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and I had to wait for it to come to video.  After seeing nearly all of this year's Best Picture nominees, I felt more inclined to see it than ever.  I finally rented it on DVD, came home, popped it in, and expected a really great film.  As much to my shock as was my disappointment, it wasn't.'Shakespeare in Love' is not a bad film, and there are some things I liked about it.  It was a sumptuous period piece, and I admired Geoffrey Rush's performance, since he never ceases to amaze me with his acting talent. Gwyneth Paltrow was fair, although her performance didn't stun me.  However, the whole time I was watching this, my mind couldn't help but drift elsewhere, and I had to wake myself up in order to pay attention.  My point is, it simply didn't grab me.  Most of the Best Picture nominees and winners are films that grab my attention and have a strong influence on me.  This one didn't.  It was a cute love story, but not strong enough in my opinion to receive as much as a nomination.  It deserved awards for costume and set design, and Geoffrey Rush's performance, otherwise no.  This film was not one of the best films of 1998!  No way!  Also, in the age of Columbine when theater owners are obsessive about carding children for getting into R-rated films, I can't see how this got an R-rating.  So what if we caught a glimpse of Gwyneth Paltrow's boobies. 'TITANIC' let us see Kate Winslet in full view, and that got a mild PG-13. There is no explicit violence or sex in 'Shakespeare in Love'.  The MPAA's obsession with sex or nudity in any shape or form onscreen is uncanny. 
As for the overall quality of 'Shakespeare in Love', it was well done.  I never said that it was a bad film, and I sort of liked it.  However, the fact that it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, proclaiming it as the best film of 1998, does nothing but disappoint and anger me.",Null,13,27,1 March 2000
Alien: Resurrection," What have they done to the 'Alien' series?

I own all of the movies (except for this one)!  I have many of the comic books, posters, and action figures!  I all I can say is, THIS MOVIE F****N SUCKS!  How could they do such a dishonor to the 'Alien' series, or the fans.  It's complete and utter s**t! Poor Ripley had to be cloned in this crap, and the 'Alien' is now a mere plot catalyst, instead of a monster!  Watch your step, or your brain around this one!",Null,0,0,15 February 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Bigger, Longer, Uncut, and better than the TV show!
","I don't know about you, but I thought this movie kicked ass!  It certainly was a hell of a lot more than I expected it to be.  I thought it was going to turn out like 'Beavis and Butt-head Do America', which lost it's comedy almost immediately.  'South Park' was a non-stop laugh throughout, and they aren't lying when they said it was 'Bigger, Longer, and Uncut'!  Finally, I found 'South Park' extremely funny, because the R-rating finally gave it's creators the freedom to swear and get some really disgusting humor out. Oh, and anyone who says this film is plotless and is just a bunch of kids using foul language obviously didn't pay much attention to the movie.  This was the perfect time to release the film, since the whole nation went up in smoke after the Columbine incident.  After the Columbine incident, an eruption of attacks and blame flew at the media, the games, and the movies. Never at any point, did the people try to find out why those kids did what they did.  They simply, and ignorantly searched for a scapegoat.  Now we've got Bill Clinton reminding theater owners to card kids to see R-rated films. It's ridiculous that society could be this idiotic.  What are they protecting kids from?  In 'Bigger, Longer, and Uncut', the foursome sneak into an R-rated movie, and come out swearing and cursing.  However, the parents didn't try talking to their kids about their language problems. They blamed Canada for making the R-rated film.  This film is a comedy, yet it played moreover as an attack on the MPAA.  The MPAA is an unconstitutional system created years ago.  And the public, who felt secure with a somewhat official system, stuck with it, and here we are.  The creators of 'South Park' were obviously trying to cram in as much foul language as they could, without getting an NC-17.  People wonder how this movie escaped an NC-17.  The answer is simple.  The show was extremely popular, and slapping a film with an NC-17 would destroy the marketability.  I told my dad that Paramount wanted to go for a PG-13 rating, and he said 'That's impossible!  It wouldn't be the same movie!' So, 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' may be really nasty.  But that doesn't mean it's not a hilariously funny movie that's got a message locked within it.  The TV show was restrained, so at some times, I got bored with it.  This movie was so funny, and so unrestrained, my sides were hurting by the end of the movie.  Definitely see it, but be forewarned, THIS IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE!  I was suprised to see how many 8 and 9 year olds were at the theater.  Parents should see it first, and judge for themselves.  And if you are old enough, don't miss this nonstop laugh-fest which will leave you in stitches!",Null,0,0,15 July 1999
Batman Returns," 'Batman' meets the dark genere of film noir. But is that good?
","I saw the first film, and liked it very much.  The hero won, the bad guy was killed, and all was right with the world.  Although the set pieces and the matte paintings were very dark, 'Batman' still saw the light of day. There was a feeling of happiness, excitement, and euphoria in the first film. That all changed and disappeared without a trace with the release of the sequel, 'Batman Returns'.  This isn't just the darkest film of the 'Batman' series.  To me, it's one of the darkest and nastiest films ever made. Maybe that's because it was so different compared to it's predecessor.  However, nothing good or even slightly euphoric came out of this film whatsoever! It's not a bad film, just a depressing one.  Everything that could possibly go wrong or bad happens in this film, because the characters and villains in the film simply choose to destroy themselves and the world as we know it. That is the usual premise for film noir, but 'Batman' is(at least I think so) not film noir!  As for the characters, they have gone from being potent and evil to just plain vile and disgusting.  The Penguin reminds me of Mr. Cresote from 'Monty Python's The Meaning of Life', because he's just an ugly, slobbering, and unsympathetic pig.  He was raised by Penguins too, which adds to more of the realism(that is, next to none).  Catwoman is sexy, but insane in the absolute extreme.  It's bizarre that after she fell out of a window, a horde of cats managed to lick her back to life.  And how is it that she can survive death because of her 9 lives?  It's really weird and twisted!  Christopher Walken didn't frighten me, even though he's supposed to, in the role of Max Shreck.  He looks like, well, a Tim Burton creation. Everyone is this film is twisted up, minus Batman and Alfred, who unfortunately, have little or no screen time or effects on the other characters.  To add to even more surrealism and insanity, this Gotham City looks more like Tim Burton's world.  It looked almost(if not exactly) like the world of 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'.  It's not bad, but it's wrong for Batman.  At least the first film had skyscrapers that were a little more believable.  Don't think that you will come out of this movie feeling happy or glad you spent you time and money on it.  It's a vicious and crazy movie about twisted people who, despite Batman's heroic intervention, eventually self destruct physically and psychologically.  It's a powerful story, yes, and it does make sense.  But if Tim Burton wanted to tell it, why did he use Batman as his storyteller?  That is what I think, made the film fall.  He had all the characters of the old series, but he had a different story. As a net result, the finished product was incoherent and mean.  It's interesting, and worth watching(maybe once).  But if it makes you feel depressed and beat, don't say I didn't warn you.",Null,0,0,4 June 1999
Blade," It has it's moments.
","There's not really much to say about 'Blade', actually.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that good either.  I thought it was well done, and had some kick-ass action sequences.  But there were some parts that were just plain stupid.  I thought the fat vamp who was burnt with an ultraviolet flashlight was pathetic.  Other than that, it was pretty cool.  I enjoyed it, but it's pure entertainment, and very little movie.  I liked the opening scene, with the 'bloodbath' and Blade storming the party.  That was just too cool. Other than that, and a few other nifty action scenes, it didn't have much left to do.  It's hard to not like this movie.  But I'm not so sure it's really worth owning.",Null,0,1,11 October 1999

","Oh boy, here we go again.  Another special effects bonanza.  Only this time, I had a little more fun with this.  'Godzilla' was a bore, and I feared that this film would suffer the same fate.  Astonishingly, it didn't.  I didn't quite care for the characters, except for Branden Fraser, and the guy who plays the mummy.  Both of them, along with the wild ride of special effects, help hold our attention for a good 2 hours or so.  For the first 5 minutes, I couldn't figure how or why the things that happened in the film did. But, after you get wound up in the film, meaning no longer matters.  There's not much to say about it, only that it was fun.  It didn't do as much for me as 'The Matrix' did, but this was still cool!",4,0,0,16 May 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow'!
","After one of Tim Burton's greatest disappointments, 'Mars Attacks', he has come back with something that can definitely be categorized as a 'Tim Burton' film.  But he hasn't made a film like this one before, and that's part of what makes it so good.  He has made little use of humor, made it more gothic and scary, and has added what none of his previous films have had, gore.  The result was an example of movie masterpiece, Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow'.  Now when I say it's Tim Burton's movie, it is his movie, not simply in the sense of the visual style and humor.  Washington Irving's story has changed.  Ichabod Crane is a cop, sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a string of murders that have been occurring.  The townsfolk blame it on the legend of the headless horsemen, which is what it is.  Tim Burton has also added a complex, more checkered past to the Ichabod character, in which he is tormented in flashbacks, by the death of his mother.  This also is the first Tim Burton that I can remember having this much excitement.  The whole thing was very exciting and it was a real trip! It was also scary in some scenes, something else Tim Burton finally showed the world he could do.  His previous films were gothic, dark, comic, bizarre, or ingenious, but never scary.  Beware though, don't be fooled by the ideas you have formed in your head about this film being another cute rendition of 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'.  This is no 'Happy Halloween' folly with a cute little jack-o-lantern.  This is serious, gory, scary stuff!  As for the cast, Johnny Depp is perfect for the role as Ichabod, but as good looking as Christina Ricci is, her character is somewhat overlooked. Much of the rest of the cast members can be easily found in other Tim Burton films.  Christopher Walken is, again, a villain, as the headless horseman before he lost his head.  But the real dynamic duo is the collaborative filmmaking relationship between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. When these two work together, you know it's going to be good.  I like everything Tim Burton has done, minus 'Mars Attacks'.  Now he has added another great film to his legacy, his own vision of what he thinks the legend of 'Sleepy Hollow' should be like!",Null,0,0,20 November 1999
The Beach," A clever story that has been mistreated and unfulfilled.
","Here it is girls, Leo's latest movie!  That's about the only reason anyone would see this movie.  I was bored and wanted something to do, and despite the fact that DiCaprio can make millions merely because of his 'heartthrob' status quo, he's not a bad actor.  In fact, he's quite good, and he does a good job with this film.  The story is quite original, based on the novel by Alex Garland, about a secret island that is paradise.  The photography is great, with sweeping visions of the island, the ocean, and even the segments with 'excess imagery' look good.  However, I couldn't help but be disappointed at how the material was treated and pulled off.  Some of the scenes waste time, while still others that are intended to be serious come across as downright laughable(aka. the scene where a digitized DiCaprio runs through a video game environment).  I also didn't like the fact that much of the story didn't come across, thanks to the over-abundant use of excess imagery.  Plus, Leonardo's character suddenly and drastically changes into some sort of 'more than a man or animal' personality.  I still thought the source material was clever and original, but it was mistreated and misused here.  I think that a director like Terrence Malick would've faired better, not that director Danny Boyle is a bad director.  I just don't think that he's meant to direct a film like this.  As for Leo, he does what he can with a nearly complete script and I wonder how he feels about the scene where he's digitized in a video game environment.  All I know is that everyone in the theater laughed out loud at it.",Null,0,1,19 February 2000
Alien," The monster movie of all monster movies!
","'Alien' is the greatest monster movie ever made! EVER!!! It is scary, smart, and has established a creature that forever exists in our nightmares!  I never have bad dreams about movies.  This is the only thing that has ever shined in my dreams.  And the nightmares are so vivid and scary.  It's rare that a film affects us so deeply.  Besides being a scary monster movie, it is an art film. Director Ridley Scott makes art films.  The way the greasy hallways, clanging chains, and dripping water make the atmosphere frightening, and helps make the creature inconspicuous.  There won't be anything like this again, except poor imitations like 'Species', and other bad rip-offs.  I have seen this film over 100 times, and it still scares me half to death.  This is an all time classic that must be owned!  And if you're lucky, be sure to surf the net and find the notorious missing scenes! They're awesome!",Null,0,1,27 January 1999
Full Metal Jacket," What going to war is all about, Stanley Kubrick style!
","Although there have been countless films made about the Vietnam war, Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' stands alone as one of the most powerful and most intense war films ever made!  It's interesting because it doesn't necessarily show the horrors of war as it does show the horrors of preparing for it.  I've had nightmares about going into the army after watching this film!  It's as hellish, if not more, than the grounds of Vietnam where the training will all prove to be of good use.  The most amazing aspect of 'Full Metal Jacket' is that it manages to present the 'war is hell' message without showing too much hell.  The combat sequences aren't as action packed and explosives laden as 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Platoon', nor should they be.  The sniper sequence was incredible, even though there weren't bodies everywhere and bullets all over!  I'm not saying that those things didn't happen, but I am saying that the sniper sequence shows how much can be done with so little.  It was awesome!  It really does give a realistic, intense feel to the film's transition to Vietnam.  But the film's real driving force is the boot camp half of the film.  Here, we literally see ordinary men shoved into a meat tenderizer and emerge as killers.  This idea is one that has put off many viewers, because the idea of the military is that the soldiers work as a 'brotherhood', in which they watch out for each other, instead of a bunch of crazies out of control running rampant.  What many people have missed though is that 'Full Metal Jacket' is not showing the reason why the military turns people into killers, it shows how they do it. And how they do it may be just as bad as the actual battlegrounds of war itself.  It's terrifying!  I wouldn't call it one of the greatest movies ever made, far from it.  But I do believe it to be a masterpiece from one of the world's greatest film directors.  It's groundbreaking and it shows us a different 'hell' of war that audiences haven't seen before, the boot camp!",Null,0,0,27 December 1999
Predator," Decent movie. Awesome effects and explosions!
","I like 'Predator', not for it's ingenuity (if it has any), but for it's flamboyant display of state of the art special effects and gargantuan explosions.  The human story is thin, but it hardly matters to you while you're watching.  This is what an Arnold movie is all about: kicking a**, and blowing up tons of s**t!  But that's not all.  His foe is an alien from outer space, and it's not just any alien.  It has sophisticated weaponry and camouflage techniques that make it hard to see or avoid getting killed by.Thanks to effects artist Stan Winston, we have a creature that looks nothing like what we have seen before.  I thought that the idea of it being like a hunter, with his trusty collection of trophies and other bones collected hroughout the universe, was brilliant.  Otherwise, it's like a 'Rambo' movie, with big.  There really isn't much intellect involved here, nor is it needed to enjoy it.  It's hard to not like this one.  Rent it, or buy the DVD, and crank up the volume high!  Very high!",Null,0,1,1 November 1999
American Pie," Suprisingly funny film!
","After all the hype and the amount of recommendations from people who said this was a great comedy, my friends and I rented 'American Pie' to see if it lived up to the hype.  You know what, it did.  'American Pie' had us laughing our asses off from start to finish.  Others have said it's not funny because it's stupid and raunchy, but the stupidity and raunchiness of it is what made it soar.  Laughter is always the best medicine, and 'American Pie' succeeds in giving us a double-dose!  None of us had seen it before, and we were lucky enough to have rented the Unrated version first. We got to see, in full effect, the version of 'American Pie' the filmmakers wanted us to see.  There's not many differences between the two versions(after reading about them on the internet of course), except the largely talked about 'pie' scene, which was pretty sick.  Still, to be frank, I thought that the Unrated version couldn't be any raunchier than R rated version.  It's silly how protective the MPAA feels they have to act for us.  I don't know.  People complain that this isn't any funnier, better, or sicker than stuff like 'Dumb and Dumber'.  I was satisfied with 'American Pie', and I thought it was very funny.  Go rent it, and rent the Unrated version.  That's the 'American Pie' the world was supposed to see.",Null,0,0,29 January 2000
Grease," Is it really the word? It's fun though.
","Actually, without the music, which for me, can only be heard and seen in the movie once in a while, this would have been a very bad movie.  It doesn't make any sense, other than it's a cute love story and a cool place for John Travolta to be.  He is, as said in a deleted scene from 'Pulp Fiction', an 'Elvis man'.  He is always doing some sort of dance number in his movies, and here is the best place for him to be.  However, if you are an intellectual who likes to philosophize about films, this isn't for you. It's a brainless movie with no point and no plot, just pure fun and enjoyment.  To my mom, it's a reflection and reminder of her growing up years in the heart of the 50's.  This is, I guess, what the film means to people.  'Grease' is the word, or is it?  I didn't think it was as big as all that.  But, this is still fun.  However, if you live with someone like my mom, who likes to hear those songs over and over again, after a while, you might feel like drilling a hole in your head!",Null,0,1,17 May 1999
The Thing," This is one of the scariest remakes ever made!
","John Carpenter's remake of 'The Thing' is without a doubt, one of the scariest films ever to grace the silver screen!  I remember watching the original version of 'The Thing' and it managed to make me jump a few times. Although it still has maintained the qualities of a legitimate artistic sci-fi film, some of the 'creep-out' factors have now aged into silliness. As for the new version of 'The Thing', it's not here to make us feel comfortable.  It's here to scare the living shit out of us!  What scares me more than anything is not the creature itself, who plays a constant game of hide and go seek with the other crew members of the research team, but the suspense.  The idea of a creature being able to recreate a perfect duplicate of another living creature was bad enough.  But when things started to get out of control, and nobody knew who was who, if they were a person or a thing, then it got really scary.  It was very paranoid, like you couldn't trust anybody except yourself.  In some moments, the characters look as if they can't trust themselves either.  Worst of all it's set in Antarctica, the coldest, loneliest place on the face of the planet.  It's like an alien world, a perfect place for an alien creature to live.  The creature is an incredible creation of design and special effects.  I liked it because it seemed like a walking germ, that had no definite shape.  We never knew what it was going to look like.  Better still, I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it, but lets just say that the fear and terror of the film is not resolved or finished even when the end credits are rolling!  And oh, that theme music that plays over and over again, brings the creep-out factor to it's peak.  It's a real tour de force of suspense, terrifying images and special effects, which are used sparingly so as to not turn the film into a mindless special effects bonanza.  This makes the old version of 'The Thing' look like a comedy by comparison.  Even on a standard television set, the creep-out factor is never lost.  If your looking for a great scare that won't leave you, this is it.  It's groundbreaking!",Null,0,1,8 January 2000
Pitch Black," Probably the worst film I have ever seen!
","I went to see this movie, not expecting much, but still was curious and hoping for something good.  After I saw 'Event Horizon', a film I liked that garnered an enormous amount of negative criticism, I kept my eyes peeled for something like it to resurface.  'Pitch Black' looked like it, and I was attracted to it.  The theater was packed, and the ads labeled it 'the scariest movie', so I was in exceptionally good spirits.  What the projector and celluloid strip revealed was probably the worst film I think I have ever seen in my life!  Never, ever, have I been so cheated and so offended by a movie!  I'm ashamed to say that I watched it!First off, there's no plot.  Next, the casting and acting is bad. Following that, it's not scary.  It's boring, actually.  Also, it's unoriginal, whatever the point of this...thing may be.  And of course, nothing is done with the characters, so you don't care about what happens to them and find yourself enjoying watching them die.   For the first time in my life, I wanted to ask for my money back, and the hour and a half of my life.  For the first time, I felt like I wasted my time.  I was upset all afternoon after it, and I woke up this morning thinking of all the different, more useful ways I could have spent my money.This movie shouldn't have been released in theaters.  It could have been released direct-to-video.  I take it back, it's not even that good.  This should have been released as a 'premiere-TV-movie' on the sci-fi channel, which loves illogical, mindless sci-fi garbage.  The best alternative would've been to shelve this movie permanently and make absolute certain that it never saw the light of day!The effects and de-saturation of colors are nifty, but that becomes boring in and of itself and fails to save this shit.  Hell, this movie is so bad, it doesn't deserve to be called shit.  For those of you who like laughing at bad movies, stay away.  This makes Ed Wood look like Stanley Kubrick!  I can't help but be deeply saddened by this movie.  It'll take me a while to recover from the shock of how I wasted my money, my hard earned money, so crudely and so thoughtlessly.",1,5,9,28 February 2000
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Useless.
","From the beginning, the absence of James Cameron and the two leading actors doomed the project.  As expected, the tight framing and loss of focus in particularly quick shots and blue tint that are commonplace in Cameron films were not here.  But that's just a stylistic complaint.  Let's move on to what's really wrong with this film.It is not entertaining or engaging.  You know the ending long before it has begun due to particular soliloquys.  The characters aren't interesting, particularly with the T-X, which did not even evoke a smidgen of fear or worry other than replicating Robert Patrick's T-1000.  The sequences play out like an average modern CGI action flick right off of the assembly line. There is no conflict, given that the previous concept of averting the future is negated by the new notion that nothing can avert Judgment Day.  This just doesn't have the heart that made the previous films work.But what really bugs Arnold fans here is that unlike the previous films of his that made you laugh because he said lines, now he has so many one liners that it becomes annoying instead of humorous.  The minute he puts on the star glasses in the opening, he immediately becomes a silly clown figure, which is bad for the character.  Pointless cameos don't help matters either. While the previous films knew how to film an action sequence, this film just plays out like a longform BMW commercial.  Ultimately, it is a waste of time and money.  There is no reason for making this film other than a hefty paycheck.  It is a useless picture in that it completely negates the previous films, as well as itself.  I haven't felt this robbed by a film in quite some time.",Null,0,0,10 July 2003
The Shining," Stanley Kubrick has proclaimed himself as not only the master of film, but the master of horror!
","'The Shining' is one of the scariest films I have ever seen!  It's also one of my favorites, due to the fact that it was crafted by the moviemaking god, Stanley Kubrick!  I love all of his movies, and this time, he has set out and proclaimed that he too can make a good scary movie!  One of the reasons that this film is so terrifying is that he was able to frighten us to the edge of our fears, and never resolve the pent up emotion and tension that has built up throughout the entire film.  It also is a horror film that shies away from blood and gore, or visual pyrotechnics, because Stanley Kubrick knew that that kind of stuff wasn't scary enough to create the kind of effect that he wanted.  Like Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Conversation', it relies on the psychological fright factor, instead of the usual bag of tricks involving blood and guts.  The only supernatural moment in the film involved Delbert Grady opening up the freezer, letting loose an animal of Jack Torrance.  Notice how careful Kubrick was in not going overboard with supernatural activity, because most of the horror existed in the mind. Jack Nicholson's performance gives the character his meat, his madness, and he utters one of the most famous lines in film history(which was actually an ad-lib)! Moreover, this is a psychological horror film that keeps you thinking all the time after you've seen it, and that is what really scares me about this film.  The more you think about it, the scarier it seems.  I think that was what Stanley Kubrick was trying to achieve, because this film is so intricately riddled with subliminals and ideas, that all mean and lead to something.  The only question is, what?  It keeps people going and going, debating and trying to figure out what all of those little details in the film meant.  Some say this was an artistic failure for Kubrick, which I think is totally wrong!  I think that the characters were beautifully defined, and the detail and terror of the film is that of a master.  This film is a masterpiece of modern horror and film, by the grand master of film himself!",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A repeat of the first film, but it's equally good!
","Don't get me wrong!  I like this movie very much.  I am a huge fan of the series, and I own the special edition of this film.  But, I've been noticing that many of the things said or done on the film are very much the same as it's predecessor.  Not the 'I'll be back' bit, but the way the T-1000 handles things.  He crashes into a helicopter, and tells the pilot 'Get out', the exact same thing Arnold said to the truck driver in the first film.  It's a kind of deja 'vu.  But no matter.  I don't think much of it when I'm immersed in the movie.  It's also perfectly executed and photographed.  James Cameron knows when he wants you to relax, and when he wants you to be hyped up with the action.  It's a hardcore sci-fi action film!  And the special effects and action sequences stand out among the best that have ever been attempted.Another aspect of 'Terminator 2' that makes it so powerful is the dynamic soundtrack.  It's really very good!  Movies today can't reproduce something this good.  This is the kind of movie that MUST be viewed with a big surround sound system.  Pump up the volume, sit back, and feel the explosions and gunfire!Best of all, is the special edition, which restores about 15 minutes of extra footage.  James Cameron is notorious for deleting significant scenes from his films in order to maintain a pace.  None of the scenes are crucial to the storytelling, but they do add more canvas and insight on the characters, on the story, and they give us a new unique look at an already great film.  To me, the must crucial restoration was the 'glitching' scene with the T-1000, where his hand gets stuck to a pole and his hand is the same color as the pole.  That scene would have given the audience a sense of hope that the T-1000 could in fact, be destroyed.  There is a single glitch in the original cut, where after Arnold's arm is jammed into a large gear, a wave ripples up the T-1000's face.  I had no idea what it was, until more and more of the glitches were restored.  Unfortunately, the DVD version, which has superb quality standards, has yet to release the special edition in that format.  Oh well.  Either way, you will still enjoy this movie.

I don't know what the point of this film is, other than experimenting with bad ideas.  Worse yet, it gets more implausible as it goes on, with Cage waking up without his face.

It's too bad Linda Blair got typecast (similar to Bela Lugosi', but I don't think she cares that much. Her amazing performance as Regan makes other actresses look wussy by comparison!  And the imagery used to envoke the idea of evil, still manage to make me shudder.  I'll never forget Father Merrin staring at the statue of the Devil in the desert.  It says that the Devil, or the Evil, is really the ultimate beast or the monster.  It is something we will all have to face at one point in our lives.  Plus, despite what others may interpret, it has a triumphant ending!  The evil is exorcised and killed by Father Karras, while sacrificing his own life.  The devil wanted Karra, and yet, he did not succeed, because Karras took his life with him.  This idea was stolen by 'The Devil's Advocate', and some other movies.

Independence Day," If the trailers and effects were bad, I probably would have avoided this.
","This movie blew me away the first time I saw it (that is, because I wasn't thinking very clearly).  The next time I saw it, I was shocked at how many people came to see this movie.  I guess they were impressed with the effects and a very ominous trailer(which notoriously explodes the White House). But Roland Emmerich, whose sci-fi duds include 'Stargate' and the wretched remake of 'Godzilla', hasn't learned much.  Hopefully, his box-office bomb 'Godzilla' knocked some sense into him.  By the way, if it wasn't for Will Smith, this film would have sunk before it was up.  The most human characters in the movie are actually the aliens!  If our world was inhabited by characters as silly, ignorant, and stupid as the ones in this movie, you wouldn't blame the aliens for wanting to destroy it.  To get through this, you have to ignore the plot and acting, and enjoy the amazing special effects.  However, ignoring a literally plotless plot, without memorable(I meant to say likeable) characters can get a bit trying after a while.

Man on the Moon," Thank you veddy much!
","'Man on the Moon' is a truly stunning look into the mind and the genius of Andy Kaufman.  It was hilarious at times, not because it was comedy, but it was looking at the sorts of stunts Andy Kaufman would pull.  Andy Kaufman truly was a genius, because he not only managed to confuse the hell out of his audiences, but he confused the people he was working for as well.  He treated comedy and entertainment almost as if it were some big conspiracy, in which the audience was left in a haze.  On the other hand, his idea of comedy was merely p***ing people off, instead of trying to make them laugh, which unfortunately, brought great hatred upon himself.  After Jim Carrey did 'The Truman Show', he has found his way into dramas instead of comedies. Here, Jim Carrey, a comic genius himself, seems as if he were born for the role of Andy Kaufman.  Carrey really does an amazing job, matching every minute mannerism and facial expression, which should most definitely earn Jim Carrey an academy award.  People complain that they know no more about Andy Kaufman than they did before seeing this film.  I knew some stuff about him, so I was somewhat prepared for the movie.  However, 'Man on the Moon' functions more as a tribute to Andy Kaufman and his comic genius, rather than a biography.  In a way, that's probably the way Andy would have wanted it to be.  I liked this film very much and it's certainly an oscar caliber picture.  Mainly, this is a film for those who liked Andy Kaufman and his comedy.

Ghostbusters," Who you gonna call?!!!
","Honestly, if you have not seen 'Ghostbusters', and did not like it, then you as dead as those ghosts in the movie, if not more dead.  What's not to like? It's a hilarious comedy, one that still gets me cracking up today after having seen if hundreds of times.  Everyone in my family quotes lines from it, and it's great fun.  The ingenious comedy cast really makes the film soar, from Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, to Rick Moranis and Harold Ramis. It was also nice to see Sigourney Weaver in a role other than Ripley from the 'Alien' movies.  And the special effects, my God, the effects are absolutely incredible, regardless of what anybody says!  Some of them you can tell how they did them, but they still look good, while others simply amaze me!  This and all the other combined talents of comedy make 'Ghostbusters' a delightful special effects comedy!  I grew up with 'Ghostbusters'.  My friends and I obsessed about it, and played 'Ghostbusters' with toy proton-packs and traps.  I watched 'The Real Ghostbusters' every day, and it remains my favorite cartoon.  I remember getting 'Ghostbusters' as a Christmas gift when I was about 5 years old. That copy has since faded out, but I still watched it, almost every day when my friends came over.  I only wish I could've seen it in theaters(I might have seen it there, but I was too young to remember). 
Last weekend, I purchased the 'Collector's' DVD, and I must say, for 'Ghostbusters' fans, and for those who just want to have a good time, it is a must!  It has loads of extras, a video commentary as opposed to an audio commentary, and deleted scenes, including a particularly weird scene in which Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd play street bums instead of Ray Stanz and Pete Venkman.  As for the movie itself, the transfer is excellent!  The special effects never looked better(well, maybe in the theaters it looked best)!'Ghostbusters' remains a phenomenon of special effects and incredible hilarity!  Unfortunately, the re-uniting of the ghostbusters in 'Ghostbusters 2' didn't quite have the same magic of the first film, but I still liked it.  If you haven't seen 'Ghostbusters', or simply didn't like it because it was 'mediocre and dated' as some reviewers at the IMDB have said, I can't help but feel sorry for you.

Some of it went over my head, but the end result was unforgettable.  The reason I liked this film was because it was definitely what people had said about it: it was weird, unique, and fascinating.  The visual style was great!  It was rough and grainy, yet very beautifully shot. Some IMDB reviewers thought this film was plotless.  It might be, depending on which plot you are willing to choose.  That is the really strange thing about 'Pi'.  On one level, it's about the greatest mathematical discovery, which would allow people to predict anything, even the stock market.  On another level, it's about a mad genius who, thinking he has found an incredible discovery, goes insane.  'Pi' twists and turns from discovery, and then onto insanity.  I guess that was what confused me and many other people who watched 'Pi'; it was hard to decipher what it was really about.

Event Horizon," Scared the #@*% out of me!
","'Event Horizon' scared the livin'...  well you know what I mean.  The taglines say 'Infinite Space, Infinite Terror'.  It doesn't say much, and it gives you the wrong impression of what you will see in this film.  After the poster and the trailers, I wrote this one off.  Then I caught it on HBO, so decided to check it out.  I suffered from insomnia after that.  IT'S THAT SCARY!!!  It's not the ship or the characters that caught my attention.  I thought the characterization was very poor (it's hard to tell or care about who's who).  But what scared me was the movie's 'monster'.  There really isn't one.  Instead, it has a demonic spirit from hell!  Many people say that this borrowed from 'Hellraiser', but I think this was pulled off better.  It's a bomb in characterization, but it's a masterpiece of horror. I can't remember the last time I was this scared.  I mean, it really scared me!  Plus, the problem with 'Hellraiser' is that they show you too much of the 'Hell' stuff.  'Event Horizon' blasts its hell in our faces, as quick and as fierce as a strobe-light flash.  It's mean!  And at the end of the film, instead of a resolution, we don't quite get an ending.  Nor an implication of a sequel.  We get the idea that the demon was never really defeated, that the crew was never really saved.  And with that, the intense buildup of fear that is at it's peak at the climax of the film, never really leaves us!  We can't leave the fear thrown at us after the movie is finished. 'I told you she won't let me leave, she won't let anyone leave.' I honestly believe, that when the film is finished, that notorious line is true!",6,0,1,4 February 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," How the hell did they do that?
","'From Dusk Till Dawn' brings a new meaning to the phrase 'twists and turns in a film.  It still amazes and bewilders me to this day how instantaniously a film could change.  The film begins with an over the top shootout in a party store, and comes off as, well, an over the top comedy.  Much like 'Pulp Fiction', it follows the lives of two vicious, violent criminals, yet the experience is fun because of the witty dialogue.  This film has what you could expect from a Quentin Tarantino film: violence, wicked hilarity, and a B-movie feel.  The two criminals, Seth and Richard Gecko(played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) take a preacher(Harvey Keitel) and his two children(Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) hostage so they can get across the border and into Mexico.  There, they will rendezvous with their boss and get their money at a bar called 'Titty Twister'.  All the way through that, the movie is a comedy, constantly making fun of the situations with the dialogue and the ridiculous violence(Quentin Tarantino's hand has a hole shot in it you can see through).  There, they enter the titty bar, where chicks and strippers...well, you get the idea.  'This is my kinda place!' says Seth, and I doubt the audience can't agree more.  After we see enough strippers, the 'most evil' stripper comes out to do her dance for the audience.  Pretty cool, huh.  What follows is the most shockingly instantanious, 180 degree turn I have ever seen in a film in my life.  The stripper leans her head back, and morphs into a vampire.  At that instant, the film has changed from a hilariously over-the-top comedy to a full blooded horror film.  Now we are into over-the-top gore and violence, and although the film still maintains some sort of humor, it's clear to the viewer that we are not watching the same movie anymore.  That instant change left me dumbfounded and truly scared, because I was not expecting it and I no longer knew where this film was going.  It is probably one of the most brilliant moves in film history! Tom Savini has a role as one of the vampire killers, and eventually, a vampire.  His presence here is perfect because of his background in doing the effects and gore for horror films(he also played a similar role in George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead').  I liked 'From Dusk Till Dawn' because of it's wit and it's truly original move, yet I am still shaken by it and can't believe that a film could change from one film to the next so instantaniously.  Not for the squeamish, I'll tell you that.  It's been a while since I've seen a movie this gross and gory.  However, if you like Quentin Taratino movies, or just like horror movies, then you'll love it.",Null,0,0,19 February 2000
The Insider," A masterpiece of craftsmanship, acting, and storytelling of a true story!
","I saw Michael Mann's 'Heat' some time ago, and loved it.  I was also excited about his next film 'The Insider'.  However, the trailers advertised what looked like an action film, so I passed on it and forgot about it.  However, the Academy Award nominations recently came up, and 'The Insider' was nominated for Best Picture.  I don't think it or any other film will win against 'American Beauty'(which I have not yet seen, but will), but nonetheless, you can't resist seeing a good quality film.  To my luck, it was re-released and now seems to be making more money than it did when it first premiered.  I saw it, and was absolutely amazed at what a good film it was.First of all, 'The Insider' is based on a true story, and it stays very true to the actual accounts, with the exceptions of some dramatic additions which were stated at the end of the film.  It was very realistic and the actors didn't look like they were acting, even though they do an excellent job of doing so.  They looked like real people, who talk to each other in a normal manner, unlike the cliched Hollywood dramas with the characters overacting and giving lines that only work in movies.  I also liked how the characters were handled.  Al Pacino as the journalist is laid back, yet determined and true to his word and never intends harm to anyone.  He cares about his subjects, and he wants to help them.  Russell Crowe as the doctor is great, because he's not some gung-ho hero who has a wife that looks like a centerfold on Playboy magazine and sarcastic one-liners.  He is a real, living, breathing family man whose wife cares for him, yet is unable to deal with the problems his 'inside' knowledge of the drug industry causes.  The movie dances beautifully back and forth from these characters.  Both are equal in importance, and both are given a great amount of care by the director.  Michael Mann makes absolute sure that you know who these people are, and what they are feeling. I also loved the camerawork, because it was never overdone.  People complain that it got out of focus at times, but that only added to the realism and artistic qualities of the film.  As a matter of fact, what makes this film so great is how everything, even the music, was underplayed.  Overdoing something for dramatic effect is silly, but is often done to 'please' the audience and wake them up.  Here, you can't help but be riveted because it's just so damn real!'The Insider' tells the story of a man, or an 'insider'(Russell Crowe) who knows secrets about the cigarette and drug industry, but is afraid to talk. He is approached by the journalist(Al Pacino) and is offered to do an interview regarding the subject.  He agrees.  Threats are made to him by the drug industry, and death threats are made to his home.  He blames the journalist, but the journalist says he only wants to help and has nothing to do with the events and threats that are happening.  The 'insider' goes for broke and does the interview, and then testifies before a court, after he is warned that if all does not go well, he could go to prison. 
Then the film goes from being a riveting case of what it took to get the truth out of the 'insider', and turns into a poignant study of how the power and manipulation of the media can take a normal family man, and destroy his life.  The 'insider's' wife files for divorce and takes the kids away.  CBS is afraid to air the story on 60 minutes because they might be sued and lose money, and their ownership of CBS.  The 'insider' moves out and lives in an apartment, in seclusion.  There is a brief moment when Michael Mann uses a digital effect to morph his room into the backyard of his home and he sees his two daughters digging in the garden.  The result is one of the most saddening images of the film, in which we see this man, this family man, lose everything he worked so hard for and loved, merely because he told the truth to the media and the court.  'The Insider' is definitely one of the year's very best films, and it's a shame that it didn't receive as much attention as it did when it first premiered.  Like I said, I doubt it will win Best Picture, but that doesn't detract from the overall quality and art of this film.  If you want to see a great film that turns it's back on Hollywood dramas and a fascinating true story, then look no further.  'The Insider' is it!",Null,0,0,28 February 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Stanley Kubrick's last great film!
","One of the things that has always amazed me about Stanley Kubrick is his ability to show something amazing, beautiful, or sick, without the aid of special effects or visual pyrotechnics.  He sees the world through the camera lens for what it really is.  One of the greatest examples of which is his scathing satire, 'A Clockwork Orange'.  Here, we see a world not too other worldly from our own.  It's riddled with derilict buildings, wicked gangs, and a government that can do nothing to change it all.  The most frightening aspect of the film is the examination and study of the main character, Alex.  He is a vicious, violent criminal who kills, robs, and rapes.  In the rape scene while singing 'Singin' in the Rain', he wears a long, protruding 'Pinnochio' nose, as an example of a man with no conscience.  His parents do nothing to raise him, and he doesn't go to school.  Later, he attacks his own gang members, gleefully slashing the hand of one of them.  Here, all the details of a criminal have been laid out. Now comes the second half of the film.  Instead of keeping him in prison, he is given a treatment making him sick every time he sees or is exposed to violence, sex, and his true love, Beethoven.  He is cured, or so it is said. After being released back into the world, those he did harm to now have a chance of retaliation.  After it's all over, the drugs wear off, and he becomes his old self again, revealing he never was cured to begin with. What makes this film so stunning and so powerful is that it doesn't go over the top or exaggerate.  It merely looks on at the real world, and foreshadows things to come.  It's actually really creepy.  But Kubrick tells the story through the eyes of the criminal, making it somewhat easier to watch, even though we should be terrified and disgusted.  Kubrick's choice of music is superb, so good that I bought the soundtrack and frequently listen to it.  Ultimately, 'A Clockwork Orange' satirizes the world we live in today, and leaves us not only with an anti-violence message, but pops a difficult question upon the audience, which would you rather?  A criminal, or a 'clockwork orange', a criminal crippled within reflex mechanisms?",Null,0,0,31 December 1999
Enemy at the Gates," Another prime example of why I hate Hollywood.
","'Enemy at the Gates' may be seen by your average historian as a good war movie.  Things like 'based on a true story' heighten it to some level of importance and integrity.  The reality of it, and many films like it, is that it's just another cliched, contrived piece of Hollywood claptrap that is neither interesting nor inspiring.  Put aside all of the hollywoodishness of the story structure and style of the movie, it fails on a geometric level to even maintain the casual viewer's interest with entertainment value. Whether this was made by a huge corporation which recycles film formulas or not, 'Enemy at the Gates' is quite tedious.  The 'love story' is hackneyed and unengaging because of it's own cliche.  The set-ups are never paid off with satisfactory conclusions.  The characters are uninteresting because they wallow in their own cardboard cut-outness.  This isn't even a good Hollywood movie.  In terms of style, one can sense the 'Private Ryan' rip-offs running amok.  Huge explosions and gunshots are filmed at a similarly fast frame rate as the battle sequences in 'Saving Private Ryan'. Now, despite all of the cliches and imperfections of 'Private Ryan', that film DID break new ground with it's style and vivid battle sequences which linger with the viewer long after the closing images.  'Enemy at the Gates' is just a boring, uninteresting retread of war movies and pointless love-triangles that is as much a failure to innovate as it is to captivate and entertain.  It's just another example of why I hate Hollywood and avoid it as much as I can.",Null,2,3,1 May 2002
Hercules," Another Disney disappointment.
","Ever since Walt Disney pictures released 'Pocahontas', it seems that all of their films following it have gone downhill.  The last great Disney film was 'The Lion King'.  After that, the last few Disney films have never managed to recapture the awesome might of 'The Lion King'.  I refused to see this film when it first came out, and I also avoided it on video.  I finally sat down and watched it with my niece, who owns every Disney movie.  My overall impression of the film was, well, it could've been better.  The villain reminded me of the genie in 'Aladdin', and he wasn't evil enough.  The songs are forgettable, and the usual comic relief was washed up.  There's nothing really to say about this.  The animation could've been better.  The CGI creature with all the heads(I don't remember what it's called) was about the only cool thing in the movie.  It reminded me of Gerald Scarfe's animation sequences in 'Pink Floyd The Wall'(maybe it was Gerald himself who designed the creature in 'Hercules').  The love story(which is part of Disney's recycled formula) was slapped in the film, as was the comic relief and all the rest of what's included in the film.  It was decent, but not great. There was nothing new.  And the villain's final curtain was quickly done and overwith, which was very unsatisfying.  It's hard for me to like Disney films anymore.  They lack the power of 'The Lion King', and the brilliant lyricism of 'Beauty and the Beast'.  Kids might like it though, little kids. Don't watch it if you've already become fed up with Walt Disney Pictures' lack of delivering a good film to it's audiences.",Null,0,1,15 August 1999
A Hard Day's Night," One of the very best of films!
","'A Hard Days Night' is one of the best films ever made, because it offers us a close look at what a day in the Beatles lives (during Beatlemania) would look like.  I've never had more fun watching a movie!  If you ever thought that the life of a Beatle was all fun and games, think again!  These guys were working 24 hours a day!  Even though the film is fictional, there is a very realistic feel to the film, like it's a documentary.  And if you love the Beatles (I know I do!), then this will be a treat!

Scream 2," Essentially a repeat of it's predecessor, only not as good.
","After an enjoyable experience of watching 'Scream', I decided to rent the sequel, so I could say 'yeah, I've seen em' all'.  I liked it in some ways, because of it's more humorous attitude towards the subject matter.  I liked the idea of the incidents in the first 'Scream' movie becoming a box-office smash called 'Stab', where souvenirs and costumes of the killer are bestsellers.  It was funny, original, and poked fun at sensationalism. However, 'Scream 2' was not much different from the first one, and it was not nearly as scary.  There was a sort of 'seen that, been there' taint and some scenes were scary, like the one where Sidney climbs out of the car over the killer, while still others wasted time.  There were also moments when it got a little weird, like the scene where Sidney's new boyfriend is carried away by crazed kids who tie him to a prop used for a play, strip him, and pour beer on him.  That left me scratching my head.  The biggest flaw though is the revelation of the killer.  I couldn't help but go 'Aw, c'mon!' when the killer's, or killers' identity was revealed.  I am still curious about the 3rd 'Scream', and just because I didn't like 'Scream 2' as much as it's predecessor doesn't mean that I didn't have as much, if not more fun watching it.  One last thing though.  How does that one guy Dewey keep surviving no matter how hacked and maimed he gets by the killer?",Null,0,0,19 February 2000
The Green Mile," A wonderful film!
","I recently had the pleasure of seeing 'The Green Mile', and all that I can say is that I absolutely loved it.  It's amazing too, because many of my friends and relatives have passed on it because people have said it was a 2-hour movie stretched out into a 3-hour film.  Not true.  It was a long film, yes, but it was never boring, and I did not seem to mind.  With 3 hours of film, you are open to greater character development, buildup, and storytelling.  I went to see 'The Green Mile', without a clue as to what it was about.  It got nominated for Best Picture, so that was enough motivation.  I have not been so absorbed into a long film like this, nor was I so profoundly affected by it.  The film is based on the book(or books) by Stephen King, yet to my understanding, it had a totally different emphasis of the story(aka. Book:horror story; Film:drama)  The film deals with miracles and believing in them, and above all, how each and every one of us walks our own path in life and have our own miracles and things to be proud of in life.  We all walk our own Green Miles.  Every aspect of the film is superb, from the acting, the lighting, special effects, and the direction by Frank Darabont(Stephen King's 'The Shawshank Redemption'.  The film was also very funny at times, particularly the scene where the new prisoner chews up tobacco into a huge mush mess, and spits it all out on the prison guard. After the film ended, I felt like I wanted to watch the 3 hours of film all over again!  I doubt that this will win Best Picture(it's tough going against 'American Beauty'), but I don't mind.  This film is still great and is worth seeing more than once.  Try to see it in theaters before it comes to video.",Null,0,0,18 February 2000
Platoon," A heart wrenching drama.
","There is a moment in 'Platoon', which still hurts to watch every time.  It takes place in a village when a platoon of soldiers in Vietnam storm a civilian village.  The soldiers don't know whether or not their enemies are hiding in the village.  Seconds later, an angry Vietnamese woman yells at the American soldiers, claiming that nobody has done anything wrong.  Her husband is being held in question, and her daughter is yelling with the other children at the American soldiers.  Then, out of anger, the American sergeant draws his gun and shoots the woman dead.  This scene has caused me to cry my eyes out every time!  It is one of the saddest things I have ever seen on a film!  Even now, just writing about it brings tears to my eyes. It is here that the question of morality and tragedy are brought into view. And that is really what Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' is all about.  Morality. This film is not easy to watch, not that it should be!  You want to really see what a painful place war is, without the use of excessive and unnecessary violence, this is it!  It's real, and it's raw, the way it should be!  Once the main character leaves the scene at the end of the movie, we feel in equal confusion and pain as he!  The only other films that brought me this close to war were 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Glory', and 'The Deer Hunter'!  This is a MUST see!  MUST!

Scream," A great piece of innovative horror film thinking!
","'Scream' is one of the first horror movies I have seen that has ever managed to scare me and delight me at the same time.  It it fun and enjoyable because it's scary, yet it pokes fun at the very genre it's categorized under.  It makes fun of horror movies, and it's scary as hell at other times.  That unique combination is what really delighted me about 'Scream'. It's a horror film that doesn't really take itself seriously.  The film begins with an ingenious sequence where Drew Barrymore is in her house by herself(great setup), and receives a phone call from an unknown stranger. She assumes it's some sort of prank, and continues to on the phone, which develops into a conversation about what her favorite scary movies are. Then, fantasy seems to turn into reality as the person she is talking to lets her know he's watching her, she sees her boyfriend tied up and killed, and then she too is attacked and killed by the intruder.  Never have I been so scared by a beginning of a film!  Sadly, the rest of the film which was also quite scary, never lived up to the fear the opening sequence produced in me.  Throughout the movie, the characters talk endlessly about sci-fi/horror films, and constantly compare the murders and incidents to how they happened in horror films.  This was where the real genius of the film came into view, because now the audience doesn't know whether to be scared or to simply laugh it off.  We don't quite know where 'Scream' is going, and that makes it all the more fun.  My only true disappointment in the film was when the killer's identity was revealed.  I know it was something that had to be done, but I always found it scarier when the killer's identity was kept a mystery.  The costume the killer wears is great, and it reminded me very much of the movie 'Halloween'.  However, 'Halloween' was a different kind of movie, because it was a serious horror film, and 'Scream' is not.  I just wish that the sequel could've been better.",Null,0,0,18 February 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," Excellent horror film!
","I have yet to figure out why this film won the 'Best Picture' award. However, it doesn't take long to figure out why this is one of the world's best horror films!  I was spellbound by it.  The acting and direction is great, and it's a story that was well transalated to film.  Still, what makes it so memorable is Hannibal Lecter.  Oh my God!  I've admired Anthony Hopkins in his reverent leading roles, but I didn't know that he could scare me so much!  He's brilliant, and adds a genius to the madness of Hannibal. Jodie Foster is good in here too, as the FBI trainee who gets closer to Hannibal than anyone.  People complain that this film was too violent or gory, but you can expect those things from a horror film.  Plus the ending is very ambiguous, and suggests the possibility of a sequel(which is in the works at the moment).

Space Jam," Cute, colorful, and funny, but so what?
","Honestly, what is there to this movie, other than Michael Jordan making lots of money with the help of the Looney Tunes?  I've seen Looney Tunes cartoons that had more to them than this!  This movie is enjoyable, yes, with lots of laughs and colorful animation, but so what?  What's the point?  Is there one?  And howcome I'm the only person on the IMDB who doesn't seriously like this movie?  It's entertaining, but where's the plot?  The old Looney Tunes had Elmer Fudd hunting for wabbits.  Those cartoons had more than this movie does.  It's a brainless, plotless, potentially pointless event that has all of the Looney Tunes helping Michael Jordan play basketball against aliens from outer space.  Catchy idea for a Looney Tunes short, but not a whole movie!  'Beavis and Butt-head Do America' had more to it than this!  What amazes me the most is that the critics loved it.  I don't get it.  It was entertaining, but that's it!  Nothing else involved or achieved.  After this, Michael Jordan literally lived on all of the commercials with Looney Tunes in them.  The network TV premiere ads called this a 'one-time, unforgettable, major event'.  What?!  This a major event?!  It just amazes me that people go to the movies, simply to turn their minds off and watch meaningless and pointless box-office glitter!  I guess this was made for kids, but I've seen children's movies that made more sense than this!  Or they probably made it to make Michael Jordan an extra bag of money(not that he doesn't already have enough money).

The Deer Hunter," The Ultimate Vietnam War Film!
","This is in my opinion, the most powerful film ever made about the Vietnam war!  It started off with a pleasant beginning, letting you inside the minds of the characters in the film.  And when the film rotates to Vietnam, it turns into a horrifying and realistic slap in the face!  Even after the film is done, it's ferociousness never leaves you nor does it cease to be unmerciful!  This is the meanest Vietnam, or argueably, the meanest war film that has ever been made or ever will be made(that was until 'Saving Private Ryan' came out).  The acting is superb in getting the feeling of misery and pain across to the audience.  James Cameron's 'TITANIC' seems fake in how the actors portray their terror, pain, and suffering.  But when I saw 'The Deer Hunter', there was no doubt in my mind that these guys we in hell!  I was completely convinced!  That hardly ever happens to me when I'm watching a film.  And the thing that's strange is, this film isn't even about the Vietnam war.  It's about how it affected, or wrecked the lives of the people who went through it!  And although there were only a few minutes of Vietnam in the film, the impact of the scene and the film altogether, lasts forever!",Null,35,69,14 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," A fine, important piece of filmmaking.
","From the trailers and the posters advertised in the newspapers, my first reaction was, great. Another dumpy special effects bonanza with CGI ghosts, no plot, and bad acting.  Just what we need.  The critics rave reviews got me interested(they should advertise the movie).  I went to see it, and was, to say the least, delighted with what I saw.  I was deeply touched by it. It's not some scary monster movie with corny acting and CGI ghosts like the remake of 'The Haunting'.  In fact, there isn't a single special effect in 'The Sixth Sense'.  Not one.  It doesn't need effects,  because it's about facing the most frightening point of our lives, death.  I walked out of the theater feeling the same way as I did when I came out of Roberto Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful', and that was very happy.  This is the first film about death that made me feel good, and ready to accept death at the time I may face it.  'Ghost' is the wrong film to watch, because it made me scared of death.  'The Seventh Seal' was about using the time you have left to live, so that didn't have a real positive impact on me either.  'The Sixth Sense' did, and I was really happy about it.  Despite it's 1 or 2 Hollywood cliches, 'The Sixth Sense' is an important film for our lives because it teaches us to face death, to accept it, and to not be afraid.  There were times in the movie when I thought to myself, why are the spirits the boy sees splattered with gore, blood, and muck?  Is this supposed to scare us? Are blood and gore Hollywood's only idea of death?  No.  It's simply the way the spirits died.  The tagline says, 'Not every gift is a blessing'.  I disagree.  I thought that the boy WAS blessed with a gift, yet he was frightened by it and he did not understand it.  I think the advertising campaign needs to rethink their methods of advertising 'The Sixth Sense', because they make it look like a stupid special effects fest, which it is not.  I would remove some of the cliches here and there, and I still think 'The Blair Witch Project' is the best film of the year.  Still, I liked this film very much.  I was deeply moved and touched by it.  I think it's important that people see this film.  It might change their lives!",9,0,0,28 August 1999
The Truman Show," One of the most earth shattering films ever made!
","'The Truman Show' is an absolutely amazing film that transcends beyond the boundaries of conventional moviemaking and storytelling.  I remember coming out of the theater the night I saw it not knowing how to feel.  Should I laugh?  Should I cry?  Be happy or sad?  It was unbelievable!  The idea of a man's whole life being televised and scripted is certainly an original and creative one, and on the whole, an upsetting one.  It's hard for me to watch Truman Burbank, brilliantly played by Jim Carrey, suffer and be so blatantly deceived and lied to by those he crosses and even lives with.  He doesn't know that his whole life wasn't under his control, until things in the show don't quite go as planned.  A piece of equipment from the set falls from the sky, Truman bumps into his dead father who wandered into the set, and he learns his wife actually hates him.  What really upset me about the film was having to watch all those actors and actresses lie, betray, and deceive Truman.  Worse yet, the fans of the show are cold hearted and cruel enough to keep watching, even at the peak of Truman's suffering.  Of course, that's what people do with movies and TV, watch people go through their trials and tribulations, pains and sufferings.  The only difference here is that the star of the show isn't pretending.  Luckily, he takes action and initiates an escape, while the shows creator battles to keep him on the set.  Finally, in a devastating scene, Truman comes to terms with reality, that he never had a life.  Thankfully, it was redeemed when he proudly walked out of the set and ventured out into the world.  What you may not know is that 'The Truman Show' is actually a film about God.  The creator's name is Christof, related to Christ, and he orchestrates every day of Truman's life.  'Don't worry about tomorrow, because God has already taken care of it for you.' Also, I didn't think Christof was playing God.  I thought it a satirical way, he really was God.  He was the creator of a show that 'gave hope, joy, and inspiration to millions', as did God with the world and his son Jesus. His wrath and anger was inflicted upon Truman when he tried to leave the set, or the Garden of Eden, and learn the truth about his life, thus receiving the fruit of knowledge.  Christof throws a violent, Biblical storm at Truman, and after Truman survives the storm, he screams out 'Is that the best you can do?', on his sailboat the Santa Maria, or the Holy Mary.  The ultimate is the ending, where Truman appears to be walking on water towards the stairway to Heaven, not knowing if he is dead or alive or if it's reality or nightmare.  Christof speaks to Truman through the clouds in a deep, God-like voice, telling him that he has been watching him his whole life.  Another aspect of Christof's God-like qualities is that he isn't actually evil, and all he wants is to do what he thinks is best for Truman. 'In my world, you have nothing to fear.'  A couple of times in the film, Christof pets Truman on the TV screen, a sign of gentleness and love. Finally, Truman gracefully bows before God and walks out of the set, and into the unknown world, thus Adam and Eve leaving the Garden of Eden and venturing out into the real world.  The whole awesome power of the climax brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.  It's the first time in my life that a film could have such a strong, inspirational impact on me. It really shook me up!  I was deeply upset that this film got a disappointing 2 Academy Award nomination, neither of which won.  Jim Carrey wasn't nominated, although looking back on his career as the rubberfaced maniac who talked out of his ass in Ace Ventura, it's amazing that he was even involved in such an earth shattering film, let alone play the main character.  But he did it.  He gave Truman a likeable, intelligent, curious, and sad quality.  I remember seeing the trailer for the first time in theaters and thinking, 'Oh boy.  Another Jim Carrey comedy.'  How wrong I was!  This film was a serious, provocative, and inspirational one that put away all the laughter with the exception of the man in the bath tub.  I remember desperately trying not to cry at the climax, watching Truman bang on the wall of the set, learning in a painful instant, the reality of his life.  What would have been really sad is if he never escaped, although an ending like that would be pointless, because the message and the meaning would be lost.  Hopefully, the AFI(American Film Institute) will put this on their list as one of the best films ever made, which I strongly would stand up for and believe it to be true in every sense of the word!",Null,4,6,1 January 2000

","This movie is just outstanding.  Loaded with mind blowing special effects, and an especially clever plot, I think we've finally found a serious role that Keanu Reeves does well!  I saw this a week ago, and when it was finished, I walked out wondering whether or not we humans are really just part of a vast supercomputer program like the ones I saw in the film. It's very paranoid, and it's artificial world is reminiscent of 'The Truman Show'.  The only difference was that this world was digital.  Another breakthrough with this film was that I was finally able to enjoy and immerse myself in a special effects film.  After F/X turds like 'Godzilla' and 'Independence Day' came out, I tried like hell to avoid another special effects bonanza.  But this time, I had fun, and the plot and characters weren't stupid and unrealistic.
Strangely enough, this film was widely attacked after the Columbine incident.  I thought about it for a long time, and wondered why so many people blame the media and the arts for people committing an act of murder. There is a difference between real life and movies, and you'd have to be a real idiot to be influenced by what you observe.  Unfortunately, those two students did commit murder, but you can't blame the movies for it.  I am defending 'The Matrix', and many other films that people are blaming for the Columbine incident!Also, I would advise you not to stay away from this film because of the Columbine incident.  If you're smart, you won't feel like killing someone after watching this film, and will be able to appreciate this film for its amazing plot and special effects.  I hope you agree with me on this matter!",Null,0,0,30 April 1999
Heat," It's just too awesome for words!
","'Heat' is the ultimate crime action movie! Seriously!  It not only has the greatest shootout ever filmed today, but it's got two of the world's greatest actors, working together for the very first time.  Seeing this masterpiece only once is a crime!  Don't even rent it, buy it!  You won't regret it! I've never been so riveted to a movie before!  And besides great action, it's got a compelling story about two people from different worlds.  One for crime, and the other is against it.  They are in a constant battle of cat and mouse.  Yet, in the midst of all the bullets and blood, there is an admiration they have for each other that transcends past anything else in the movie.  And at the end of the movie, when all our emotions and nerves have been pumped up to a heart pounding tension, we feel their admiration! It's a feeling crime movies don't usually give us.  And that is the main reason this film goes from a random action flick, to a movie masterpiece! Don't miss Heat!",Null,0,0,12 February 1999
Cube," I saw an ad for it on the sci-fi channel...
","I saw an ad for it on the sci-fi channel, and managed to catch it on it's television premiere.  As usual, the sci-fi channel loves crap, so I wasn't expecting a very good movie.  It's not as bad as some of the other things I've seen in the past.  Basically, it's for idiots.  The whole movie is mainly putting human beings into a pseudo rat maze, and watching them run about until they die.  Whoopee.  I'm excited.  What turned me off were the characters.  The characters make Matthew Broderick in 'Godzilla' look like Han Solo!  They're that bad.  Part of what makes them so bad is the corny acting.  The lead character seems to be the likeable leader.  Next thing you know, he's trying to kill everybody.  Worse yet, the most annoying character of the film, the retard, is the sole survivor.  His repetitive squealing noises serve to lower your overall enjoyment of the film.  I thought the sets were good, and the opening sequence exhibited some cool exploits of gore.  From then on, the film spiraled downhill.  What's really scary about this film is that a lot of people really liked it!  I don't understand. What's to like?  Somebody tell me.  It'll be a long while before anyone gets me to like this crock of shit!",1,6,13,29 August 1999
The Thin Red Line," Great film! But not for the first time you see it.
","First of all, don't think that I am sucking up to this movie.  I felt the same way most people did the first time they sat through this; bored and exhausted.  I was very predisposed against this film the first time I laid eyes on it.  But then, I saw it on a pay-per-view network, which made it my second viewing.  With that, I finally realized, this is a pretty darn good movie!  Don't get me wrong!  It will go over your head the first time you see it.  You'll be sitting there and thinking 'Oh my God!  When will this stupid piece of s**t end!'.  I know I thought that, and my Dad told me that the movie went over my head.  He could not be more right.  I saw it again, and was finally able to appreciate Terrence Malick's exquisite masterpiece. It's a really amazing film, because it's drenched with war, but it's not about the war.  It's about human beings who are caught up in it, and yet, they are still able to endure and survive with peace, beauty, and happiness in their lives.  It's a really beautiful film.  But do realize, you have to see it at least twice to appreciate it.  And if you've seen it once and hated it, try to watch it again and see a really great film!",Null,0,0,30 April 1999
Donnie Darko," One of the best films of 2001.
","Upon watching the trailer for 'Donnie Darko', one expects another simpering, stupid teen horror flick.  Upon actually seeing the film(which was very hard for me to do, given it's extremely limited release), it is a rare piece of film art!  Next to 'Mulholland Dr.'(which I thought was the year's best film), 'Donnie Darko' is one of the very best films of the year.  It's completely original, exciting, funny, dark, scary, and above all, beautiful. It's a shame that this film wasted away in obscurity while idiotic pieces of drivel like 'Pearl Harbor' and 'The Fast and the Furious'(just to name a couple) scored.  This is one of those rare films that leaves you with not only a lasting feeling of 'wow, I never saw anything quite like that before!', but also deeply moves you and stays with you long after the end credits finish rolling.  You've probably already have some idea of what 'Donnie Darko' is about, so there's no need for me to analyze it.  My review is meant to give my overall impression of the film.  If you don't know anything about it, then see the film with an open mind and surrender yourself to it.  The suprises and imaginativeness of the film will be even more fun and enthralling this way.",Null,0,0,12 March 2002
Pocahontas," The worst Disney film I have ever seen!
","This is the real reason why I don't watch that many Walt Disney cartoons anymore.  I haven't seen 'Hercules', and I'm not interested in 'Tarzan'. Basically, I think that the animators ran out of ideas, came across the name 'Pocahontas', and suddenly thought they had a real movie in their hands. There is nothing new to any of the Disney films these days!  All of them run on the same formula; villain, hero, love interest, comic relief, and musical numbers.  I was so bored with this film, I don't even remember what happened during the course of the movie, nor did I care!  They really slipped up this time!  Sure 'Pocahontas' was a real person, but that doesn't mean make it into a 'full-length animated feature'!  The music is not uplifting, like the heavenly score of 'The Lion King'.  The heroine, which is of course, the title character, really didn't impress or grab me.  The villain, oh forget about him.  He's just an annoyance.  John Smith does a good job, of serving no purpose.  The only character I liked in this film was Meeko, the pesky little raccoon.  Otherwise, this film went down before the first 5 minutes were up.    No new breakthroughs in animation and computer technologies were made either.   It's a shame, because Disney could've made it better, and I liked some of the other animated films, like 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'. I also hate to admit my disliking this movie, because my older sister really liked it.  But, to be perfectly honest, this was the worst Disney film that I have ever seen!  It's boring, undeveloped, uninteresting, and lacking in the qualities that a truly great Disney film owns and carries with pride! It makes me sad, because it ruined my faith in the Disney films, and my belief that they could ever make a great animated film ever again!",Null,7,13,9 June 1999
Jurassic Park," Pretty good!
","I remember seeing 'Jurassic Park' on its opening day, and was blown right out of my seat.  It is very much like Spielberg's 'JAWS'.  It's scary, exhilarating, funny, and all in all, enjoyable.  I loved it!  It was really the popcorn movie of the nineties.  I'm not saying that it's the best movie made.  In fact, my opinion of the film has changed over the years.  But I will say, it was very enjoyable!  It was well acted, scripted, and directed. Best of all, was the sound and the special effects.  This was the first movie to use DTS DIGITAL SOUND in movie theaters.  I can remember it being so loud, that when I went to see a different film, I could hear the T-Rex stomping around from the other room.  It also made me jump out of my seat many times.  My brother was a little dissatisfied, but I like this film.  I still do.  It's a shame that the 'Jurassic Park' saga suffered the usual fate of sequels, as seen in 'The Lost World'.  Nonetheless, 'Jurassic Park' is pretty damn good!",Null,2,4,4 February 1999
