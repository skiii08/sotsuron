Catch Me If You Can," Excellent!
","What a great film! There is such a harmonious balance of dramatic and cinematic elements achieved in this film, something I haven't seen in awhile. The acting is superb! Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Christopher Walken are wonderful. The plot is intriguing and had me to the very end. The characters are very well developed and are presented in a very authentic and real fashion. The visuals are absolutely astounding and the editing and direction are outstanding. The film is never slow or pretentious and is stays true to what it is. The motifs of the film and its style and tone are displayed wonderfully throughout. John Williams has not written such a fine score in years and Spielberg is once again at the top! Five stars! A Real Winner!",9,0,1,12 January 2003
Gangs of New York," What a Waste!
","What an awful film! I found it extremely hard to sit through. It was very incoherent and inconsistent. The terrible editing, bad dialogue, historical inaccuracies, horrible plot, and stupid story prompted the question WHO CARES! Honestly, who cares about this story, its extremely idiotic, predictable, and cliche. The only thing that kept me from walking out was the excellent performance of Daniel Day Lewis, otherwise this film was a disgraceful waste of time.  I give it a one out of ten and that's being nice! Mr. Scorsese what were you thinking!",1,9,19,12 January 2003
