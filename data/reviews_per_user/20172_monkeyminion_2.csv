The Avengers," Genius work
","I came into watching this movie blindly, I didn't know much about the Avengers at the time, all I knew was that a bunch of superheroes were going to work together for the first time ever. But to tell you the truth throughout this whole movie my heart was racing and the hairs on my spine and arms were standing up. I could feel the rush of excitement every time Tony Stark suits up and when Steve Rodgers grabs his shield. The humor made the whole theater laugh which made me lighten up and to tell you the truth this movie made me obsessed with superheroes and I would never believe in a million years I would be this into people turning green and tearing everything up but that is what makes me want to see more of Joss Whedon's masterpieces.",10,2,6,7 July 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Amazing movie but not as good as first!
","This movie had a touch of everything; Comedy, Action, Suspense, Drama, and Romance. The advertising went way too overboard, might as well release the whole movie marvel if you want to release 25 5 minute trailers. For some reason this movie did not give me the goosebumps of the hair raising excitement as the first spontaneous Avengers. I believe after watching all of the trailers and sneak peaks I ran out of excitement and I knew what was going to happen in every scene. What really made me angry was the mid-credit scene, why use Thanos in the second avengers movie when we have to watch 5 more marvel movies to see him. Heres a hint marvel, save Thanos for civil war and give us a peek of Spiderman so we don't have to watch him being bit by a spider for the millionth time.",7,2,7,7 July 2015
