The Blair Witch Project," Scariest Movie Ever Made!
","Once I saw this I wrote a list of my favorite horror movies, Blair Witch topped Grizzly and Texas Chainsaw Massacure. Im 28 and Im skeptical to watch this again...This movie was too well done you swear to god it was a true story! Excellent dialogue by actors/actress and awesome videography! The final scene is etched in my mind and I really thought Id have nightmares........",8,1,3,12 August 1999
