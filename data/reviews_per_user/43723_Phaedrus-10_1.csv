The Blair Witch Project," Found the concept interesting - hated the characters.
","This movie has a truly new and interesting concept but, unfortunately, I just couldn't stand the people in it. I didn't care at all about them as their incessant petty bickering was a real turn-off. I found myself rooting for the witch and hoping she/he would hurry up and do these jerks in.The 'home movie' style camera work did add a feeling of authenticity but the constant moving around of the camera made my stomach queasy.",1,0,1,22 August 1999
