Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best movie ever made
","This is what you get when two of the most brilliant minds in the entertainment world converge. Steven Spielberg, a gifted director, and George Lucas, an imaginative producer, bring us the greatest film ever assembled: Raiders of the Lost Ark.What makes this movie so great? By sheer entertainment value, no other film touches it, and it is made with such a quality not seen in films before or since it (not even its two sequels could reach that plateau, albeit they are fine films in their own right). Every frame is filled with beautiful imagery, and the excitement is constantly building.What type of movie do you want to see today? Do you want to see an action-adventure flick? A romance? A comedy? How about a drama? Fantasy? Can't decide? Watch this film, and you will get a little of all these genres, combined into one fabulous classic.",10,0,0,29 June 2000
