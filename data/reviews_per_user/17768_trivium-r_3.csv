Blade Runner 2049," my opinion . .
","I never seen part 1 of this movie before, but it doesn't matter for me.
In my opinion, firstly, I'm considerably impress with many scene in this movie because it look fantastic and mysterious . Secondly, Ryan Gosling, he played his role was very nice.His role look same as mysterious man and seriously try to find the truth .Thirdly, I prefer to the fight scene of this movie because it look real but i think it not enough to audience, should have more than this .",7,1,2,27 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," little bit disappoint . . . . . . . . .
","Before i start to review this film, I wanna tell everyone that I' m a star wars fan since I was 15 years old, I just saw The last jedi about 5 hours ago. However, I have many point to review after I saw this film.I will separate are both of disappointment and impression. Let me talk about my disappointment to this film before impression.
 For my disappointment, firstly,after saw this film, I still not clearly know that who is ray's parents , there are many questions about ray's parents after The force awaken was released , and I expect that this film will give a good answer to me. Unfortunately, look like this issue is not important for this film, I believes that many people disappoint about this .
 Secondly, Supreme reader Snoke in The force awaken look seriously mysterious and so powerful character , It hard to believe that he quickly to die. In my opinion, writer should tell about the origin of Supreme reader Snoke more than this and audience should have opportunity to see his power of dark side and fighting more than this .
 Thirdly, the scene that encounter between Luke and Kyro len, before I saw this film, I considerably expect that I have to see dual-lightsaber seriously scene between both of them like The phantom mance (obi wan vs. darth maul scene). Unfortunately, disappoint again for this scene.
 Fourthly, the humour in this film is not funny enough to audience.I notice from interact of many people who watched the last jedi at the same time with me in theater , when some humour scene arrived, the audience have completely quiet.
 Fifth,I think Sound directors,they reduce bass sound of lightsaber, especially lightsaber sound while Rey have swing her lightsaber in training scene, that made me not impressive 
 For my impression in this film, firstly,I really appreciate that they bring Yoda, jedi master come back to this movie. It very surprising for me, Furthermore,I will very surprise more if they bring Obi-wan kennobi come back to joint with them.
 Secondly, I think the location where they chose for this film is amazing place also including amazing animals in this film such as crystal fox, porg and other, I like so much.
 Thirdly, Fighting scene both of Kylo ren and ley to encounter with the group of red guard knights.It is a novelty of fighting scene in Star Wars movie that I like also.
 All of my reviews above, maybe someone disagrees with me, sometimes I think i expect too much about this film. However, I really expect that Abrams will create Episode 9 as I expect. And Finally, I still love Star wars movie and I will continuously watch about Star wars universe.",7,0,0,17 December 2017
