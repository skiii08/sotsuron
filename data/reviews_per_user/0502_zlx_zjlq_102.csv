Systematic torture, portrayal of journalists' work (more dramatic Newsroom), attention to the progress of the event itself rather than indulging in cheap lyricism, and modest depictions of several major reporters with different perspectives and different attitudes...All these have set an example as the highest standard of this type of social biographical drama.

Room," Love is the real antidote
","When such keywords like abduction, imprisonment, and sex slave were proposed, it was generally believed that the safest way to deal with them was to render a tragic atmosphere and use a realistic lens to tell the story that the protagonist falls from freedom to the abyss and then escape hard.
But this movie chose a difficult path. The tragedy factor is only used as the background of the story. The focus is on how the mother and child escaped the room where the flesh and the soul were imprisoned.
In my view, the real theme of the film is that, with the support and help of the loved one, even in this tortured tragedy, human beings can become stronger and live a wonderful life.",8,0,0,3 April 2020

The war had become an unbreakable curse, making people irresistible and unable to escape. In the hearts of Iraqi children, the seeds of hatred has been planted and would germinate and bear fruit after many years. And the American soldier had fallen into war and was unable to adapt to normal peaceful life, as if war had become the only meaning of his existence.Both sides are victims.

","The magic of the film is strong. Such a film, which uses supernatural power as the key narrative factor of the film, is destined to make the answer of many profound problems found through magic, not by human. From the perspective of supernatural forces, it is actually a simple redemption story. However, the director has extended too many themes, and there are no foucs among the several themes, which makes the film's original meaning of 'redemption' chaotic and obscure. And the way of elaboration is a bit more contorted and contrived. The procrastinating rhythm and overly complex theme make the character, scene design, and macro structure of the film very superficial, rather than serving the theme. Therefore, although the topics discussed in the film are diverse and difficult, the deterrent effect on the audience is obviously insufficient.",7,0,0,23 March 2020

Amélie," It's art
","Emily helped the blind old man walk across the road and overpass and countless shops, quickly told him what he saw, and then left like an angel.

Rear Window," Turn decay into magic
","The use of the lens in a limited space is amazing. Because it is 'peeping,' most of them are subjective lenses with the meaning of inspection and observation, but the arrangement of human eyes, telescopes, cameras and other media is not visually tedious at all.",8,1,1,28 March 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end of an era
",A Blu-ray extended version for almost four and a half hours. The scene of the war is still magnificent. It is Frodo's luck to have a good friend like Sam. Gandalf is still otherworldly and holy. The last part of the play makes my eyes wept. This is the end of the epic blockbuster and an era. But classics will become eternal.,10,3,3,24 March 2020

Green Book," A flawless movie
","Tony and Don give each other courage and redeem each other. The soundtrack editing and tempo of the movie are so great that even if the second half seems to be banal and impractical, it cannot cover the laughter and tears in the story. The film is really brilliant in the actor's modeling and details, both in script writing and in the performance of the actors. In contrast, Tang is slightly weaker, perhaps because his emotions are dark lines, or it may be that he is too closely connected with politics.",9,1,1,17 March 2020

Mad Max: Fury Road," Cool!
","A seemingly (but actually not) simple and crude post-apocalyptic survival and resistance story, combining the fierceness of westerns, the unrestrainedness of highway films, and the extraordinary artistic atmosphere of fashion films.

Back to the Future," Still exciting
","The originator of time and space traversal, the textbooks which countless latecomers copied and followed. How to grasp the contradictions, bury details, and control the rhythm, especially the gorgeous and smooth two-line setting at the climax is still amazing and exciting even 30 years has gone.

The Godfather," Classic
","The gentle rhythm contains great authority and tension, music eases faint sorrow, and conflicts of interest and human nature conflict.
