Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Bloody Satisfaction
","You may already have heard that 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is talkier and more character-driven than the stylish, enigmatic 'Vol. 1'. Indeed, 'Vol. 2' has moments of tenderness and heartbreak that its predecessor never came close to. We also learn more about the Bride (Uma Thurman), including her real name and her relationship with Bill (David Carradine), who makes his first on screen appearance. But while 'Vol. 2' is not the gleeful blood flood that the first installment was, the action remains sharply paced, darkly comic, and consistently surprising.The rogue's gallery of villains left standing when the lights came up on 'Vol. 1' are appropriately fiendish here. Daryl Hannah gives Elle Driver's one eye a furious workout while Michael Madsen shines as the grinning, twisted cowboy Budd. Budd's attempt to dispose of the Bride is truly fraught with terror. Perhaps most importantly, Carradine does not disappoint as Bill, who proves that emotional ties can be more formidable than an army of Crazy 88s.As for the Bride herself, Thurman's performance is unforgettable. The Bride's heroic stature grows with each frame, particularly when we see her struggle under the tutelage of the unrelenting Pai Mei (a terrific Gordon Liu) in flashback sequences.Writer-director Quentin Tarantino delivers another gorgeous, wild 'Kill Bill' movie, this one packing a fiercer emotional punch. Here is a movie that pulls the rug out from under its audience at every turn, never settling for less than brilliant. 'Kill Bill Vol.2' is a wholly satisfying conclusion, a breathtaking new classic.",Null,0,1,19 April 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Depp is Fantastic!
","Based on a theme park ride, 'Pirates of the Caribbean' has a bright, shiny, Disney world quality. But then, were you expecting - or even hoping for - gritty realism?Johnny Depp's inspired performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is enough to keep cynicism at bay. Depp's fine comedic instincts and ability to fully inhabit a character light up the screen. His work is as impressive as Sparrow's eyeliner is waterproof.In fact, the whole affair is exuberant and entertaining enough to qualify as enjoyable fluff quite preferable to dreary event pictures from the 'Independence Day'/'Armageddon' mold.",Null,0,0,14 July 2003
Coffee and Cigarettes," Vice as Nice
","Jim Jarmusch's 'Coffee & Cigarettes' is a collection of spare, comic vignettes that feature the beloved vices of the title. As with any film of this kind, some segments outshine others. However, 'Coffee & Cigarettes' has a nice effect as a whole, with repeated bits of dialogue and visual motifs helping to tie it all together. The cast is eclectic and appealing. The inimitable Steve Buscemi is funny as a waiter with unique theories about Elvis, Iggy Pop and Tom Waits share an amusingly passive-aggressive conversation, and Cate Blanchett is quite good in a dual role as both herself and her cousin. Jack and Meg White make a lovably surreal appearance, with Jack in particular proving himself a strong screen presence. The two comic highs of the film are one bit featuring Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan and another with Bill Murray opposite RZA and GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. A final segment featuring William Rice and Taylor Mead closes the proceedings on a strange, dreamy note.And all of this adds up to...? A unique, droll little movie for those in search of a change of pace.",Null,0,1,1 June 2004
Ed Wood," Pure Magic
","Tim Burton's 'Ed Wood' takes a comic, affectionate look at the beloved Z-grade filmmaker. Johnny Depp is wonderful as the eternally upbeat Wood, and the supporting cast is excellent.The film's opening credits are lifted from Wood's 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', and its beautiful black-and-white photography is an homage to '50s sci-fi. Lovingly recreated gaffes from 'Glen or Glenda', 'Bride of the Monster', and 'Plan 9' should delight Wood's fans and inspire new converts to his ever-growing cult.Burton demonstrates his underrated gift for comedy in his best work to date, an exceptional film and a sweet tribute to some of cinema's true individuals.",Null,0,0,14 July 2003
X-Men," Uncanny.
","Here's the concept: to make a good blockbuster, don't use your story as an excuse to flaunt your special effects budget, use your special effects budget to help tell your story. Bryan singer, the director of the cool '90s neo-noir 'The Usual Suspects', must understand this,  because his 'X-men' adaptation is one of the finest superhero flicks ever made. The classic characters and strong performances give the movie much of its zing - dig Hugh Jackman's insta-star turn as Wolverine - and help elevate it above the rest of the big-budget pack.",Null,0,0,25 June 2003
Sleepy Hollow," Gory, Gorgeous
","Johnny Depp stars in Tim Burton's retelling of a classic tale by Washington Irving...that pedigree alone gets 'Sleepy Hollow' noticed.But wait until you see it! It's a sumptuous, stunning period piece that is both an enchanting fairy tale and a sanguinary slasher flick. Burton's film is uncommonly beautiful to the eye and benefits from Depp's presence as the fidgety, haunted Ichabod as well as Christopher Walken as the freaky dead hessian himself. A unique treat for horror fans and anyone who appreciates visually dazzling cinema.",Null,0,0,20 August 2003
The Shining," Heeere's Jack!
","Few films have been as thoroughly absorbed into popular culture as 'The Shining' has. Stanley Kubrick's tale of isolation, madness, and murder is an undeniable classic.Jack Nicholson stars as Jack Torrance, a frustrated writer who loses his mind during a stint as winter caretaker at the snowbound Overlook Hotel. This does not bode well for Torrance's wife and son (Shelley Duvall and Danny Lloyd), who are trapped in the hotel with him.A combination of stunning imagery (particularly a torrent of blood crashing through the hotel elevators) and slow-building dread provide the film with a lingering creepiness. Nicholson's thrilling, wildly unhinged performance takes over from there. Raising his eyebrows and an ax, Jack becomes a poster child for the badly behaved and criminally insane.",Null,0,1,7 January 2004
Edward Scissorhands," Wonderful Weirdness
","Once upon a time, there was an Avon lady desperate to make a sale. She decided to try the foreboding black mansion at the perched at the edge of her aggressively pastel suburb. There she met a man dressed in bondage gear, sporting Robert Smith hair and sharp appendages.So begins the story of 'Edward Scissorhands', a marvelously strange film from director Tim Burton. Johnny Depp plays Edward, the scissor-equipped creation of a well-meaning inventor (the legendary Vincent Price) who died before he could finish Edward. Depp brings a palpable sweetness to Edward, who is easily distracted by his wonderment at the world around him. Edward's dialogue is sparing, but Depp speaks volumes with his eyes alone.A fine performance from Johnny Depp can salvage an entire movie ('Benny and Joon'), but his work is not this film's only asset. The entire cast is strong, and Burton's take on suburbia amounts to a feature-length sight gag. 'Edward Scissorhands' possesses enough whimsy, humor, and heart to be considered a cinematic treasure.",Null,0,0,31 December 2003
The Princess Bride," As You Wish
","You really can't argue with casting Andre the Giant as a giant.Actually, you can't argue with much when it comes to 'The Princess Bride'.The film begins with a grandfather (Peter Falk) reading a book to his sick grandkid (Fred Savage). The book is 'The Princess Bride', and so we meet the titular princess, Buttercup; her true love, Westley (the wonderful Cary Elwes); and a bevy of good and evil fairy tale beings trying either to bring the lovers together or tear them apart.'The Princess Bride' works as both a playful sendup of fairy tales and a smart entry into the genre. William Goldman does a fine job adapting his novel, and director Rob Reiner gracefully mixes comic absurdity with swashbuckling romance. What more could you want?",Null,0,0,10 March 2004
Hero," Worth Getting Into
","A subtitled martial arts film with a historical flavor that toys with reality - 'Hero' may take some viewers time to get adjusted to. And yes, there's an awful lot of that gravity-defying wire-work that has recently surged onto the action scene and since become a favorite target for parody.But 'Hero' is worth it for director Yimou Zhang's magical visuals, particularly his vivid, glorious use of color. One also must appreciate Tony Leung's excellent performance as Broken Sword. Whenever the story turns to Broken Sword, his lover Falling Snow (Maggie Cheung) and his young protégé Moon (Ziyi Zhang) the screen lights up. All three actors are wonderful.The film's ultimate message is something to inspire discussion. Is it about the beauty of sacrifice? The need for peace? Submission to the government? See it and decide for yourself.",Null,3,5,26 December 2004
The Evil Dead," The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror, as Advertised
","Creepy, clever, devilishly funny and all-around classic, the original 'Evil Dead' is essential viewing. Sam Raimi directs, and Bruce Campbell makes his debut as Ash, a sweet kid from Michigan faced with the unfortunate task of dismembering his possessed peers. 'Evil Dead' is energetic and compulsively watchable, a testament to what a bunch of crazy kids can do.",Null,0,1,25 June 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," More is More
","Would you believe that one of the most anticipated movies of all time will actually exceed your expectations?Start believing.'Kill Bill: Vol.1' is an intense, shocking, incredible experience. Quentin Tarantino is as thrilling as ever, but he's never been this epic. The movie has Tarantino's trademark quirky humor, flip chronology, pop culture references, and buckets of blood. But this time he threw in the kitchen sink, including a pretty nifty anime sequence.The film revolves around the Bride, a onetime assassin attacked by her old gang and left for dead on her wedding day. Awakening from a coma four years after the attack, the Bride decides to exact her revenge.Uma Thurman is the Bride, doing an excellent job with an extremely demanding role. Sonny Chiba also does great work as the Bride's martial arts mentor.'Kill Bill: Vol.1' 's longest, wildest, and funniest fight sequence takes place between the Bride and the Crazy 88s, an army of bodyguards in the employ of Lucy Liu's vicious assassin Cottonmouth. Blood spurts, limbs fly, and you won't believe your eyes.Yet for all its gore, this is one beautiful and atmospheric work that is too breath-taking to feel like half a movie. Which is not to say that 'Kill Bill: Vol.2' won't be even more highly anticipated than its predecessor. Not only does Volume 1 end with a stunning revelation, but Tarantino is in fine form, which makes his current film about as good as movies get.",Null,0,0,14 October 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I Can't See Your Face In My Mind
","In 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', lovers Joel (Jim Carrey)and Clementine (Kate Winslet), have had a falling out. Impulsively, Clementine undergoes a procedure to have all her memories of Joel erased. A crushed Joel follows suit, only to change his mind after the process has begun. Much of the film takes place in Joel's mind, in the memories he is desperate to keep. Did I mention this is a Charlie Kaufman screenplay?Kaufman's twisted story is in good hands with director Michel Gondry, whose inventive visuals border on the magical. Grounded in fine performances by the leads, the film is also deeply felt and heartbreaking romantic. Carrey's scruffy, sad-eyed Joel and Winslet's free-spirited Clementine are fully realized characters who truly seem to need one another.
Beautiful, moving, and undeniably unique, 'Eternal Sunshine' is a movie to remember.",Null,0,1,12 April 2004
Reservoir Dogs," A Perfect Crime
","'Reservoir Dogs', Quentin Tarantino's brilliant first film, left an indelible mark on movies a decade ago and still packs a mighty punch. You know the story. A band of thieves with colorful code names tries to cope with the staggeringly bloody aftermath of their failed diamond heist. Mayhem ensues.The movie is graced with classic dialogue, brutal black humor, and a hilarious soundtrack of sunny '70s pop. The ensemble cast is fantastic, with Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth turning in amazing performances as the film's principal gangsters. Roth and Keitel's characters share a friendship that gives 'Dogs' much of its emotional heft, and both actors nail it. As if all the above (not to mention beautiful photography and memorable costumes)weren't enough, 'Reservoir Dogs' is still more than the sum of its parts. Tarantino's love for movies seeps into the heart of this film and gives it a unique, celebratory spirit that is better experienced than explained.",Null,1,3,6 May 2003
Rocky," Enduring & Endearing
","When you think of 'Rocky', you probably think of that soaring music, the film's many sequels, and possibly Sylvester Stallone drinking raw eggs. While all of those things are certainly a part of the 'Rocky' experience, the film has so much more to offer.Stallone wrote the screenplay about Rocky Balboa, a southpaw club fighter who makes his money as an enforcer for a Philadelphia loan shark despite his intrinsically sweet nature. Indeed, it is Rocky's sweet nature that leads him to see the beauty in Adrian, the shy girl that he visits at the pet shop every day. As Rocky helps Adrian to come out of her shell, he finds himself randomly chosen to go toe-to-toe with the heavyweight champ, Apollo Creed.'Rocky' isn't just about boxing but about people daring to dream of something better for themselves. The many pleasures of the movie include the easy, often funny dialogue and the well-shaded characters throughout. Stallone and Talia Shire share lovely chemistry while Burgess Meredith, Burt Young, and Carl Weathers - inhabiting Rocky's trainer Mickey, Adrian's somewhat sleazy brother Paulie, and the preening champ Creed, respectively - are great to watch.Both the film and its title character ooze goodwill and heart. The sequels can be fun, but the original 'Rocky' best understands what winning and losing are really all about.",Null,0,0,26 December 2004
Pulp Fiction," An American Classic
","Sure 'Pulp Fiction' - Quentin Tarantino's collection of interconnected crime stories - is a landmark film that has inspired a galaxy of imitators.What's really important is that it is an absolute joy to watch (and listen to!). Tarantino demonstrates his considerable gift for dark humor, smart dialogue, wild plot twists, and undeniable visual style. 'Pulp' is one of the brightest jewels not just of Tarantino's impressive oeuvre, but of American cinema as a whole.Credit must be given to the large cast (Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Kietel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, etc, etc, etc) that positively sizzles.'Pulp Fiction' is quite simply one of the most original, exuberant, exhilarating, movies ever made.",Null,0,1,15 September 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Essential Jack
","Milos Forman's immortal 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is the stunning story of Randle P. McMurphy, a convict who feigns insanity to escape the work farm. Full of mischievous vitality, McMurphy becomes a hero to his fellow mental patients and a bane to the institution's administration, particularly one Nurse Ratched. The film is a brilliant portrayal of tragedy and redemption. Jack Nicholson's performance as McMurphy is simply one of the best that he - or any other actor- has ever delivered. Louise Fletcher's work as the controlling, vicious Nurse Ratched is unforgettable, as is Will Sampson's turn as the stoic Chief.",Null,1,3,12 April 2004
Army of Darkness," Groovy.
","The third 'Evil Dead' movie, 'Army of Darkness' avoids being just another horror sequel by using humor and creativity to keep the material fresh.In this installment, Bruce Campbell's indispensable hero Ash has been transported back in time to medieval England. There he fends off ghouls and woos a damsel in distress, all the while trying to find a way back to his own time. Sam Raimi's inventive direction and Campbell's easy charm make 'Army of Darkness' a high-spirited, satisfying sequel.",Null,1,1,30 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," SNIKT!
","The X-men are back, many of them with better hair!'X2: X-Men United' possesses many of the qualities that made the original 'X-men' notable. For one, Hugh Jackman is again superb as the all-important Wolverine. Newcomer Alan Cumming is also excellent as Nightcrawler, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is better than ever as the shape-shifting Mystique.
'X2' also has a sense of humor about itself without descending into the campiness that made the 'Batman' franchise crumble. Admittedly, 'X2' does have a lighter touch than the first 'X-Men', focusing more strongly on whiz-bang thrills than its character's inner conflicts. Thankfully, the whiz-bang thrills actually work. The opening sequence (set in the White House) is dazzling, and Wolverine has an intense bout of berserker rage as well as a great showdown with his femme equal, Deathstrike.'X2' seems proud to be a summer movie thrill ride - and you'll want to take this ride again and again.",Null,0,0,22 September 2003
Jackie Brown," Well Worth Your Time
","'Jackie Brown' is different. With this film, Quentin Tarantino takes a half-step back from his own distinctive style to adapt a novel by his hero and obvious influence, Elmore Leonard. It's true that 'Jackie Brown' is one of the more overlooked films on Tarantino's luminous CV. It is a comparatively quieter work than the director's other, more explosive, films. 'Jackie Brown' even unfolds in (nearly) linear fashion. Be that as it may, this is one funny, richly detailed, and memorable crime story.Pam Grier shines in the title role, imbuing Jackie with great depth, humanity, and strength. Grier shares a fine onscreen chemistry with Robert Forster, who is excellent in his role as a smitten bail bondsmen. The rest of the cast, including a villainous Samuel L. Jackson, contribute well. Robert Deniro and Bridget Fonda make a very funny - if unlikely - comic duo.Tarantino wasn't looking to top 'Pulp Fiction' here. He set out to create a stylish and enjoyable movie, and succeeded.",Null,0,1,2 August 2004
The Breakfast Club," Don't You Forget About Me
","Directed by John Hughes and starring Brat Packers Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, and Anthony Michael Hall, 'The Breakfast Club' is THE quintessential '80s teen movie. The plot is simple enough: five kids from five different cliques are stuck in Saturday detention together. They talk and get to know one another, eventually realizing how alike they are. It's the getting there that's fun. The characters and dialogue are very well done (and its a good thing, because that's really all there is). The kids in the cast are great, and you have to love that theme song by Simple Minds. If you haven't seen this one yet, where have you been?",Null,0,1,10 May 2004
Evil Dead II," Bloody Good
","Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead II' goes just as far as its predecessor...then several steps farther. This is not a bad thing. The movie is a blood-drenched, sugar-happy, nightmare-come-true for horror fans. It's wonderfully imaginative and insane. Raimi fashions a world where almost anything can happen and does.Bruce Campbell's work as Ash is one of the film's greatest assets. Some of its best moments come when Campbell is the only actor onscreen, putting on a sort of slapstick one man show. These scenes would not work without Campbell literally throwing himself into his work, which he does with a vengeance. Give the man a hand.The entire production serves as a fitting centerpiece for a great horror trilogy, as well as a reminder of how much fun a movie can be.",Null,0,0,13 May 2003
High Fidelity," High Quality
","You have to love record stores. I mean REAL record stores that have vinyl and long memories, where shoppers feel like they  might actually unearth some forgotten gem in a bargain bin. That's the kind of place that Rob (John Cusack) owns and operates in 'High Fidelity', a comedy directed by Stephen Frears and based on a novel by Nick Hornby. The scenes of Rob and his co-workers - played to perfection by Jack Black and Todd Louiso - are wonderfully authentic and very funny; and probably could've made a worthwhile movie on their own.But 'High Fidelity' is more than that. We're clued into Rob's stormy love life, including his recent break up with Laura, who he still loves. Rob is scarred by his romantic past and compulsively lists his worst break-ups the same way he does his favorite records. It takes time and some misadventures for Rob to heal and realize what he really wants from love, but getting there is a blast. Cusack is a great fit for his role and gives an excellent performance. The cast provides strong support, particularly the hilarious Jack Black. Too many movies lack heart and soul, but 'High Fidelity' has it. It's a rich, knowing, funny film to be savored.",Null,0,1,17 March 2004
