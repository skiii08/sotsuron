Hereditary," Worth a watch! But not everyone's cup of tea!
","Non spoiler review. So removing the elephant in the room: Hereditary is a better horror movie, even though it's not best amongst the many craps that has come out in recent years.
I did enjoy the suspense and slow pase story telling of the first 2 acts of the movie. But end of the second act gave away the entire plot and story of the movie. And the 3rd act where much more was expected and should have happened, was utter disappointment as the suspense went blown away way before.Director has done a real decent job with a script that doesn't catch up with his/her skills.
The main character Toni Collette who was excellent in the first half of the movie, but felt like lost her interest in the second half as she was trying too much and was all over the place.
Alex Wolff looked like stoned through out the movie, but I think he has done justice to the character as it asked for the same.
Catch of the movie is Milly Shapiro as i can say the her acting and casting for the character was too damn good.P.S. I really don't want to call this movie a horror one as it more suits to be a thriller. Reason being it felt like a surgical attack on the audience mind rather than sudden ruthless attack.Hope you guys enjoy this movie.",6,0,2,24 September 2018
