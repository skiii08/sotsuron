The Hangover," didn't make me laugh....
","well, i really expected much from this movie after all the awards received but i was really very disappointed....it tried too hard to be funny and this wasn't funny....in fact it was like a drama movie in which people had terrible things happened to them and one was lost....i began watching this movie with open mind and i was prepared to laugh at any given moment but no, it didn't work for me...i thought maybe it was me not getting the comedy but i was relieved after seeing all those negative reviews , at least there are still some people who could really say it sucked!!!if you want a good laugh watch - very bad things- instead....",2,3,5,29 August 2010
