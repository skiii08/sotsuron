The Rock," The best movie I´ve ever seen
","Hollywood action movies changed, since the TWO ACTION GODS came with their kind of action --- MICHAEL BAY and JOHN WOO are those two. The Rock is Bay´s second flic (first one were the Bad Boys. A pretty cool debut, huh ?) and WAY best. Powered with awesome cast (NICOLAS CAGE the best actor on God´s green Earth, Sean Connery, with his 'Bond after fifty years' and Ed Harris, who plays the best villain in history. The action sequences are ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR, you have to see it for yourself to believe it. Schwarzmann´s camera and Smith´s music make this piece even better. If you want to see the #1 action movie, your choice must be The Rock. If you want to see two EXCELLENT action movies, go for The Rock and Face/Off (another 'Nic-powered' masterpiece). HOWG !!!",10,1,1,7 May 1999
The Fifth Element," As usually .. Besson=masterpiece
","Besson´s previous flics, like Leon, Nikita or Atlantis were awesome and so is his newest piece 5 Element...I even think its his best movie. The universe Besson shows is breathtaking, even more than the one showed in Blade Runner. Milla Jovovich did a really great job. Gary Oldman is as great as in Leon. Bruce Willis managed to portrait an interesting character, so he did a good job as well (though nothing can beat his James Cole in 12 Monkeys). The visuals are marvelous...Gaultier´s costumes , Serra´s music...all of those things make this movie awesome...I read that this is a 'SCI-FI MOVIE OF THE DECADE' ....I have to agree with that",10,0,1,18 April 1999
Face_Off," John and Nic from USA, John from HK ..... ACTION FROM HELL !
","Castor Troy and Sean Archer. The ultimate enemies. Face/Off is about relationship between those two men. That´s a VERY rare thing to see in an action movie. It doesnt concentrate on the action itself, it's more about Castor and Sean. John Woo, Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. These three people bring you the best action movie of 1997 (well....actually Face/Off, The Rock and The Matrix are the best action movies of all times...in my opinion, that is). While John Travolta makes Sean (who really is Castor...are you lost ? well....you have to see it, to understand it) really evil, Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performance in his career. Face/Off features the ultimately best ACTING in an action movie. That's not all.....where is the action  ??? ......well...the answer is ...EVERYWHERE. John Woo manages to surpass Michael Bay´s masterpiece The Rock with his TERRIFIC action sequences. If you had a chance to see John´s previous movies (Hard Boiled, The Killer, A better tomorrow 1, 2 or his US debut Hard target) you know what I mean. Overall, Face/Off is one of the best movies I´ve seen.",10,1,2,7 May 1999
