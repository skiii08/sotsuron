The Blair Witch Project," scary as hell
","Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest. Who would have thought three college kids being chased by an unseen ghost would have become one of the highest-grossing films of all time? The idea was so simple, almost quaint, I wish I'd thought of it. I'd be sitting in a hot tub in Aruba with Paris Hilton now . . . but that's a different story. This film struck a chord with the American public that's hard to identify. What did the Blair Witch represent? Was she nature, raped and despoiled by male-dominated American bourgeois society? Was she the Goddess of the Witches, Hecate, striking back for having been persecuted by Christianity? Or was the film itself an affirmation of Christian values, as so many horror films ironically are? Certainly the three student filmmakers come to grief after scoffing at the Bible-toting old woman's chilling tale of her own encounter with the Blair Witch. The film has obvious parallels with Stephen King's 'It' and much of H.P. Lovecraft. Whatever. Anyone can make a movie, but not everyone can make a GOOD movie. 'The Blair Witch Project' succeeded in part due to clever Internet hype, but largely due to the raw, cinema-verite film-making that imparted grisly authenticity to what otherwise might have been a cheesy exploitation film, and to the superb improvisational skills of three talented young character actors--Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Mike Williams. We could identify with them thanks to their very ordinariness. They were everyone's son, daughter, boyfriend, brother, sister. Their plight reminded one of soldiers caught behind enemy lines in wartime . . . Ironically, the real Burkitville MD (yes, Virginia, there is a Burkitville) is close to the sight of some major Civil War battles. The bottom line is, it's a darn good film.",9,2,4,2 January 2007
I'm Not There," this movie is habit-forming
","I do not know if 'I'm Not There' is as fun for other people as it is for Dylan fans, but if you're really into Dylan it's addictive. I rented the film from Blockbuster and watched it 4 and a half times before my eyes gave out. The movie is all the more amazing considering it had Dylan's full cooperation despite its rather unflattering thesis: that Bob Dylan's constantly changing personas are the mark of a pretentious poseur who never really believed in anything. A more charitable view is that Dylan's many masks are a defense mechanism adopted to protect him from the incredible pressures he has faced throughout his career. So many rock stars have been destroyed precisely because they were unable to distinguish their real selves from their stage persona--Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Bryan Jones, to name only a few--just as Dylan himself came close to not making it with his 1966 motorcycle accident. If there is a real Bob Dylan in the film it might well be Richard Gere's Billy the Kid--the one trait Dylan has never wavered in is his obsession with the Old West and Americana--this is probably as close a glimpse as we will ever get to Dylan's psyche. Although attention has understandably focused on Cate Blanchett's Jude Quinn, all six Dylan dopplegangers are brilliant, especially young Marcus Carl Franklin as Woody Guthrie and Arthur Whishaw as Arthur Rimbaud. Heath Ledger's Robbie Clark is a reminder why we will miss this brilliant actor, and 'Dark Knight' co-star's Father John (the born again Dylan) bears an uncanny resemblance to the Reverend Jim Jones. Of the supporting cast Bruce Greenwood and Charlotte Gainsborough are outstanding, while Michelle Williams steals the show with her devastatingly sensual portrayal of an Edie Sedgewick-based character. An amazing film you have to see to believe. But please see it.",10,2,4,26 July 2008
Citizen Kane," that's the way it is
","Everyone knows that 'Citizen Kane' is the greatest movie ever made, and there's little I can say here that will add to what's already said. However, there is so much more to 'Citizen Kane' than just a movie, no matter how superlative. 'Citizen Kane' is nothing more than a priceless document in American history; in tracing the life and career of one man, Charles Foster Kane, Welles presents nothing less than the history of the United States from 1871 to 1941. The film is also a chilling example of the ability of a power-mad media mogul to manipulate public opinion. Citizen Kane could just as well be Citizen Turner or Citizen Murdoch. It's incredible how many careers were launched as a result of this film. Among the uniformly excellent supporting cast the performances that linger in my memory are Everett Sloane as Mr. Bernstein, Ray Collins as Boss Jim Getty, Paul Stewart as Raymond the Butler, and of course the legendary Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother. The only flaw in an otherwise perfect work of art is the intentionally bad opera sequence, which goes on far too long. No wonder Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) attempted suicide. Who wouldn't, if they were forced to sing that drivel every night?",10,3,4,19 November 2006
Alien," Halloween in space
","In many ways, the first 'Alien' can be described as the sordid underbelly of '2001: A Space Odyssey.' Instead of pristine white interiors and clean-cut young men in shorts we have the cramped interior of a grimy, smelly cargo ship with a surly and contentious crew. This is as far from the perfect world of 'Star Trek' as you can get. The men are unshaven, and everyone smokes, drinks, and uses bad language. Tom Skerritt as the captain does little to inspire confidence, and the only person who knows what she's doing is Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who ironically becomes the only survivor, launching Sigourney Weaver's career as a star and becoming the first female action hero in film history (unless one counts Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz.') It's interesting how the imagery of this film influenced later science fiction, particularly the series 'Red Dwarf.' In terms of plots, 'Alien' follows the general outline of the classic slasher film 'Halloween,' with Ripley in the Jamie Lee Curtis role. The alien creature is still probably the most repulsive monster in movie history; unlike 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' or 'E.T. The Extraterrestrial,' this is a first encounter that is anything but joyous.",10,6,10,19 November 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," as good as it gets
","American movies don't get any better than 'The Best Years of Our Lives,' the Samuel Goldwyn-produced epic from 1946. It had everything: a great story, an incisive director (William Wyler, whose other credits include 'Ben Hur' and 'Roman Holiday'), cinematography by Gregg Toland, and a cast to die for (Fredric March, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright and Harold Russell). Although the movie was made sixty years ago, the subject it deals with is sadly relevant today: the readjustment problems of returning war veterans. Three men have to overcome their inner demons: Al Stephenson (Fredric March), the wealthy banker, has difficulty returning to his comfortable life after enduring the horrors of jungle warfare; Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), the ex-Air Force bombardier, is now just another working stiff with a bimbo wife and an uncertain future; and sailor Homer Parrish (real-life amputee Harold Russell, who won a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar) is afraid to face his fiancée with hooks. Fortunately, each man has an understanding woman to help him through his transition: Al's wife Milly (Myrna Loy), daughter Peggy (the wonderful Teresa Wright) and Homer's fiancée Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell). This movie is a genuine piece of Americana, and one only hopes our current generation of combat vets will find the same love and understanding.",10,2,2,21 November 2006
Closer," all talk, no action
","Natalie Portman is the reason God created women in the first place, and she's the main reason for seeing this talky but absorbing film. Although Julia Roberts and Jude Law receive top billing, Ms. Portman and Clive Owen give the strongest performances, highlighting the difference between a mere 'star' and a true actor. 'Closer' is basically a photographed stage play. Fans excited by the prospect of the Israeli cutie playing a stripper will be disappointed that she's never completely naked, but she gives a complex and moving performance as a needy, clinging waif whose constant demand for love and affection drives men away. The characters talk about sex but we never actually see any of it. One part of this film I disliked, and which is annoyingly frequent in films made in Britain today (including another Julia Roberts vehicle, 'Notting Hill,' is the almost obligatory display of self-loathing by the main characters. Do middle-class Brits really hate themselves so much? Maybe the loss of the Empire has robbed Britain of her sense of purpose; the U.K. seems fated to become nothing more than a political and economic satellite of the U.S. (what George Orwell in '1984' called 'Airstrip One.')",8,1,1,19 November 2006
Full Metal Jacket," war is hell
","War is hell, but boot camp is worse. At least that's the impression I got from watching 'Full Metal Jacket,' Stanley Kubrick's second anti-war classic in thirty years (the first was 1957's 'Paths of Glory.') Since it's based on fact, 'Full Metal Jacket' is not as mind-bending as '2001: A Space Odyssey' or 'The Shining,' but it has all of Kubrick's visual trademarks: harsh, bright lighting; cold, impersonal settings; and lots of whites, reds, and golds. Like the other movies, it deals with ordinary Americans seeking to survive in a hostile environment: first, boot camp, run by a psycho drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey), then urban warfare in Hue City, where they must contend with both the Viet Cong and their own superiors. The boot camp sequence is the best part of the movie: Ermey's sergeant character is clearly out of control, but he's not really a bad guy: he's just doing his job, trying to teach the recruits the skills they will need if they're going to survive in Vietnam. To see Vincent D'Onofrio as the slug-like 'Gomer Pyle,' then see him in his present role as Detective Robert Goran in 'Law and Order: Criminal Intent' is to see just how much this amazing actor has grown. Matthew Modine's Joker is the voice of reason and the story's anchor. The combat scenes are horrifying, but the movie ends on an oddly upbeat note, the troops singing the 'Mickey Mouse Club' theme song as they pull out of Hue. Add a killer soundtrack of 60s rock and roll and a hilarious cameo by Papillon Soo Soo as a consumptive Vietnamese hooker, and you've got a winner. Maybe not as good as 'Saving Private Ryan,' but still a great war film.",10,5,9,20 November 2006
The Grapes of Wrath," one for the ages
","At first glance John Ford, a life-long conservative Republican, might seem an odd choice to direct the film of one of the most famous social protest novels in American history. The assignment was a success because Ford approached the novel more from the viewpoint of its human drama than its ideology. There simply isn't a more beautiful black and white film in the American canon. Gregg Toland's cinematography is exquisite; it's no wonder he went on to shoot 'Citizen Kane' and 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' Except for the fact that it uses well-known stars instead of non-professional actors, 'The Grapes of Wrath' has in embryonic form all the stylistic hallmarks of Italian neorealism. Henry Fonda gives the performance of his life as Tom Joad, and Jane Darwell won a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Ma Joad, the eternally stoic earth mother who keeps the family together in the face of insurmountable odds. My favorite character, though, is the renegade preacher, Jim Casy, played by John Carradine at the height of his acting career before his eventual slide into grade-Z horror and exploitation movies. The film's depiction of the persecution and oppression the Oakies faced in their epic trek to California is especially relevant in connection with the plight of undocumented workers in present-day America.",10,2,4,21 November 2006
The Shining," home sweet horror
","'The Shining' is my favorite horror movie. I can relate to the theme of family dysfunction--the alcoholic, abusive father; the frightened, overwhelmed mother; and the withdrawn, almost autistic child--because it mirrors my own childhood experience, just as the family's isolation as caretakers for an abandoned hotel recall certain events when I was growing up. I don't want to go into too much autobiographical detail here so I'll focus on the film. 'The Shining' has all the motifs common to Kubrick's films starting with '2001: A Space Odyssey': a cold, impersonal narrative tone; harsh, bright lighting; and brilliant musical choices, especially Bela Bartok's 'Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta.' The photography is brilliant, especially the use of the then-new Steadicam, which Kubrick was to use to good advantage seven years later in 'Full Metal Jacket.' As in all of Kubrick's films, the theme is survival in a barren, absurd cosmos. Danny Lloyd is simply the best child actor I've ever seen, and Shelly Duval's very plainness makes her all the more believable as an average housewife and mother. It's ironic that Stephen King disliked the film because he thought Jack Nicholson hammed it up too much as Jack Torrance: how do you underplay a homicidal maniac? This movie is so good it's frightening.",10,2,3,21 November 2006
American Beauty," pretentious drivel
","Why has this dreary little piece of suburban angst become such a favorite with so many people? The whole premise is abominable: after losing his job, hen-pecked Kevin Spacey (an actor whose appeal is beyond me) starts buying pot from a high school kid and drooling over his lovely teenage daughter's Lolita-ish friend. What's so hip or revolutionary about working out, listening to classic rock, or smoking pot? Spacey acts like he's in prison (although with his shrewish wife, played by a grating Annette Bening, maybe he is). Then there's the self-hating repressed homosexual Marine Corps colonel, a stereotypical figure played without a shred of subtilty by Chris Cooper. Where's R. Lee Ermey when you need him? Then there's the eponymous 'American Beauty.' Mena Suvari is no doubt a cute girl, but she's not really beautiful. Thora Birch, the daughter in the film, is far better looking. But there's something creepy about building a whole film around ephebophilia. This is one of the few films I ever bought on DVD that I was unable to watch more than once. I gave it to my cousin for Christmas. Now I have to spend the next twelve months dreading what her payback will be come Yuletide.",3,5,10,2 January 2007
The Exorcist," bless me, Father
","Max Von Sydow has made a career out of playing religious figures. Besides a number of religious allegories in Sweden with Ingmar Bergman, for English-speaking audiences he was Jesus in 'The Greatest Story Ever Told,' an over-zealous missionary in 'Hawaii,' and, on the other side of the spectrum, he was the devil in 'Needful Things.' Whichever side he's on, you know that Von Sydow will be the big boss man: his commanding presence and natural air of authority make it impossible to see him as an 'average Joe.' His Father Merritt is a reassuring figure: you know we're in good hands when he arrives at Regan (Linda Blair)'s bedside. This movie raises some interesting questions. Although it was made a quarter-century before pedophile priests became fodder for 'Oprah,' I can't help wondering just what kind of problems Father Karras (Jason Miller) was dealing with as a psychiatrist to his fellow priests. Throughout the film there's a sense that something is amiss in the world . . . and in the Church. If a twelve-year old virgin can be possessed by the Devil, who is truly safe? Conversely, why should the Prince of Darkness invest all his powers in claiming the soul of a movie star's quite ordinary daughter when he could just as easily possess the President of the United States or the Premier of the Soviet Union? Nevertheless, this is a great movie with an air of moral seriousness that prevents it from being merely exploitative. It's hard to understand how Christians like Billy Graham could say the movie itself is evil when if anything it reaffirms Christian values without being as shrill as later examples of 'Catholic horror' like 'The Omen.' William Friedkin's direction has the same gritty authenticity that distinguished 'The French Connection': his priests are believable as priests, just as in 'The French Connection' his cops were believable as cops. Even after thirty-three years, this film still packs quite a wallop.",9,4,6,21 November 2006
Lawrence of Arabia," slow but absorbing
","It is difficult to watch this movie today without thinking about the current situation in Iraq. Europeans--and now Americans--have been intervening in the Middle East, with disastrous results, since the Trojan War; 'Lawrence of Arabia' tells the story of a man who played a key role in a critical period that led to much of the current turmoil in the region. In order to defeat the Turks, who were allied to the Germans, Great Britain unleashed the genie of Arab nationalism, and no one has been able to bottle it since. By promising what was then Palestine to both Jews and Arabs Britain unwittingly planted the seeds of the interminable Arab-Israeli conflict--but that's outside the scope of this review. Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence as a bipolar, sexually ambiguous nerd with a messiah complex (interestingly there are no women in the movie). In leading the Arabs to victory over the Turks Lawrence sees himself as their liberator when in fact he's the tool of western imperialism. The latter part of the movie, which depicts Lawrence's bumbling attempts to introduce western-style democracy to the Arabs, bears striking resemblance to George W. Bush's equally naive meddling in Iraq. As spectacle, the movie has never been surpassed and scarcely equalled; among big-budget epics of similar scope only 'Ben Hur,' 'The Ten Commandments,' and possibly 'Apocalypse Now' come close; the only movie with similar grandeur is '2001: A Space Odyssey,' and of course that's a different kind of epic. Sir David Lean won a well-deserved Best Director Oscar for this film. The movie made stars out of O'Toole and Omar Sharif, but there are Oscar-worthy performances from Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Arthur Kennedy and Claude Rains; Jose Ferrer is uncommonly creepy as a sadistic Turkish officer, in a scene with uncomfortable homoerotic overtones. Maurice Jarre's score is outstanding; this is the kind of film wide-screen was made for.",10,5,10,12 December 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," mythic tale of death and rebirth
","I have watched this movie more times than I can remember. The first time I saw it I was in seventh grade and I didn't understand it at all. It's one of those films, like Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo,' that grows on you the more you see it. My favorite part (although I used to hate it) is the 'Dawn of Man' sequence. The African photography is beautiful, and the apes (australopithecus?) are so convincing it's hard to believe they're really actors in ape suits. The acting in this movie is often underrated; Keir Dullea's boyish good looks and calm, reassuring demeanor bring to mind real-life astronauts such as John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, and William Sylvester is perfect as the glad-handing bureaucrat Dr. Heywood Floyd. I think Kubrick meant for the film to be enjoyed as a visual experience rather than analyzed for any deeper meaning, but for what it's worth, I see it as a Buddhist(or possibly Hindu) myth of birth, death, and rebirth. But the best way to watch the movie is to just sit back and enjoy the music and photography without worrying too much about the plot.",10,4,9,18 November 2006
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," a critique of master morality
","I did not hate this movie. 'Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom' is probably the most widely excoriated movie of all time, but once you see it you realize that Piero Paolo Pasolini has fashioned a daring and disturbing vision of humanity's innate capacity for evil. I've never understood why so many writers and philosophers have made a cult of the Marquis de Sade. It's important to realize that Pasolini's take on the story is completely in opposition to Sade; instead of glorifying his aristocratic degenerates he portrays them as callous, hypocritical sycophants of fascism, whose atrocities are all too plausible in the context of the regime they serve. The notorious manure-eating scene, while hard to watch, was necessary to drive home the point of just how contemptible these monsters are. Much has been written about the disturbing passivity of the victims, but it's obvious the young men and women are terrified and with good reason. Rape is an act of violence, not sex, and the abuses perpetrated here have little to do with real eroticism; interestingly, any consensual sexual activity among the prisoners is punished with death. Although set in fascist Italy during World War II, the story could just as well be taking place in Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia . . . or Iraq for that matter. This film is a cautionary tale about what happens when people forfeit their humanity in service to a corrupt regime. As if to underscore his point Pasolini's characters frequently quote Nietzsche (the philosopher who did the most to spread Sade's gospel of evil throughout the world); during the final torture-execution scene we hear a radio broadcast of poetry by Ezra Pound, an American poet and willing accomplice in fascism. That Nietzsche and Pound still enjoy any legitimacy in academic circles shows how desperately we need this movie. The final torture-execution scene, though horrific, is filmed as seen from binoculars, which distants it and makes it somewhat more bearable. I don't think Pasolini was indulging in obscenity for its own sake; the violence, though brutal, is not notably more explicit than what goes on in most contemporary slasher films. Interestingly, though Pasolini was gay, this film does not portray male homosexuality in a positive light. There's something in 'Salo' to disturb, engage, and enrage everyone, no matter their ideology. Perhaps that's a good thing.",10,19,32,2 December 2006
Rosemary's Baby," don't trust anyone over 30
","'Rosemary's Baby' is the first generation gap horror movie. 60s 'It' girl Mia Farrow plays a sweet young thing who moves into an exclusive Manhattan apartment building with her struggling actor husband John Cassavetes, who brings his usual edgy neurosis to the part. All their neighbors are elderly, and it turns out that they are also a coven of witches whose mission is to find the perfect mother for the devil's child. Rosemary, whose name is oddly reminiscent of the Virgin Mary, is the perfect choice, and her actor hubby is quite happy to sell his soul to Satan in return for help with his career. Like 'The Manchurian Candidate' and 'The Killers,' 'Rosemary's Baby' is one of those movies that captures a vivid snapshot of the paranoia and unrest of the 60s, a decade that began so promisingly but that ended in assassination, riot, and social unrest. Holocaust survivor Roman Polanski, who was soon to lose his pregnant wife Sharon Tate to the murderous Manson 'family,' directed, closely following Ira Levin's brilliant novel and in the process creating 'Catholic horror.' Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer are excellent as the nosy neighbors who turn out to be the devil's henchmen, as is Ralph Bellamy as the sinister doctor who's part of the conspiracy. Shakespearean veteran Sir Maurice Evans (Maurice on 'Bewitched') plays the one sympathetic old person in the movie. 'Rosemary's Baby' set a standard for Hollywood horror that has seldom been equalled and never excelled. Only 'The Exorcist,' 'Jaws,' and 'The Shining' come close. Of films made during the last decade only 'The Blair Witch Project' approaches the same standard.",10,2,4,6 January 2007
Gladiator," C.B. would be proud
","It's a shame Cecil B. DeMille is no longer with us. If he were alive today he would be gratified to see that the type of movies he loved to make are popular again: 'Gladiator,' 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' and 'The Passion of the Christ' are all the kinds of movies DeMille made; all of them are movies he would have made if the screenplays had been around in his day. 'Gladiator' is a gloriously retro sword-and-sandal epic, a cross-pollination of 'Spartacus,' 'Ben Hur,' and 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'; director Ridley Scott uses modern CGI technology to make the kind of movie they don't make any more. Although not 100% historically accurate, it's irresistible drama. Russell Crowe is one of the few actors today who can pull off this kind of heroic role; he has the gravitas despite his bad-boy reputation in real life that blond pretty boys like Brad Pitt and Colin Farrell can never hope to approach. Connie Nielsen is a sensuous presence as Lucilla; River Phoenix as Commodus is the creepiest villain since Ralph Fiennes' Amos Goetz in 'Schindler's List'; and the supporting cast is full of stand out performances. It's good to see 'I Claudius''s Derek Jacobi back in toga; what's an epic without Richard Harris? and of course Oliver Reed as the lovably irascible slave-trader Proximo, who proves not to be such a bad guy after all. The film completely ignores the persecution of Christians under the otherwise humane Marcus Aurelius; but then, 'Pirates of the Caribbean' ignores the presence of slavery in the eighteenth-century West Indies.",10,1,1,21 November 2006
