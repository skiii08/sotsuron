The Blair Witch Project," Did you love or hate this film?
","Did you love this one-of-a-kind dark horse Multiplex entry in the Summer of 1999, or were you shocked that a 'poorly shot home video' went as far as it did.  I'm in the middle.  While other shoestring budgeted film-makers try to make their productions look as slick as possible, the makers of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT purposely went for an unpolished rough look.  That means this a gimmick film (Like THE THIEF- 1952, a spy thriller with no dialog or 1973's WICKED-WICKED where the whole film was split screen.)  The star of the film was the medium. The documenting of three  student filmmakers lost in the woods, and possibly at the mercy of an unseen witch gets very tiresome.  If human star- Heather Donahue meant to play an irratating character, she did a fantastic job.  The logic of the film leaves little to be desired.  If you are lost in the woods, follow a river (they lead to bigger water bodies and civilization)  or follow the sun. I did love the last section, where Heather makes her on screen apology.  (That's the shot where we see only her nostril and nostril hairs on multiplex screens.)  The film turns from being a documentary of a witch hunt to a last will and goodbye left on video.  I actually got a bit chocked up.  The finale in the spooky house left haunting images (The many handprints on the wall, Mike in the corner, waiting to be executed) but lacked logic (Would you lug about a video camera while running for your life?)       The summer of 1999 gave us two successful horror films that pulled the genre out of the Freddie/Jason/bikini gal in peril rut (The other being THE SIXTH SENSE)       Final summary:  Poorly planned film with genius marketing and a few good scenes.",Null,0,1,2 January 2001
The Sound of Music," A bit of fun SOUND OF MUSIC trivia
","We all know SOUND OF MUSIC is one of the biggets money makers of all time. It's recent DVD reissue has been a major success.  It's a fun movie, cool wholesome fun.  But, here's some wacky trivia....Upon it's release in 1965, the Korean distributor felt the film was way too long.  They trimmed it down by cutting out ALL THE MUSICAL NUMBERS.What remained is what played in movie theatres in Korea.",Null,1,8,22 November 2001
Lifeboat," The first of Hitchcock's experimental single-set films.
","Excluding the fact that half of THE LADY VANISHES is set on a cramped train, LIFEBOAT is the first time Alfred Hitchcock experimented with setting an entire film in a single cramped set. (ROPE and REAR WINDOW did the same trick)  This time, the cramped set is a lifeboat full of American and British survivors of a passenger ship sunk by a German U-Boat.  The time is World War II, and the film serves as a microcosm of the world's feelings towards the enemy and ourselves.     These survivors pick up one more person at sea, a German, (frightfully played by Walter Slezak) one of the people who sunk the boat.  Hitchcock gets fantastic performances from his cast- Tullulah Bankhead, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee, Heather Angel, William Bendix.  Well worth catching.",Null,5,6,28 November 2001
Unbreakable," Curious thriller closes lackluster year for movies.
","2000 may be one of the most humdrum years for movies since, I don't know- the 1970's!  M. Night Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE was a compelling 2000 entry, but not quite up to snuff.  Bruce Willis plays a stadium security guard who gains a sixth and seventh sense (Sorry, had to do it.)  He is able to survive an inescapable disaster unscathed and he can tell what's on your mind.  This brings about an interesting turn in his relationship with his son, his estranged wife, and a creepy art dealer (Samuel Jackson)  Shyamalan will never get a job at MTV or for the Fox Channel, because his films are slowly and methodically paced.  The man cares enough for his audience and lets scenes slowly soak in. I have to say the film does wander about aimlessly until the last segments, where Willis is in a train station, and he can read the minds of most of the people passing him by.  This causes him to investigate a total stranger, a seemingly normal looking man who has a frightening secret.  Not the slickness and cleverness of SIXTH SENSE, but a neat time at the theatre or video rental.",Null,0,0,2 January 2001
Alexander," 'There are all types of love.'
","In three weeks since it's Thanksgiving 2004 release, Alexander has only recouped less than one/forth of it's $150 million dollar budget. The film just trods along. It's impossible to buy Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mom. She doesn't bloody age. (Well, her idea of aging 25 years in this film is to hoist her hair up in a bun and don't run around screaming as much.) Colin Farell gives a good performance as Alexander, but he doesn't come across as the conquerer on much of the world. He comes across more like an above average Burger King manager. CGI work tends to mar the battle scenes. The super-clean sets are a joke. They look like something out of 'Alexander- the Video Game' What has happened to Oliver Stone?",Null,1,3,14 December 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Every frame a keeper.....
","Every frame of Tim Burton's successful 1999 film version of SLEEPY HOLLOW is a keeper.  Bathed in dark, dank colors, it is one of the closest attempts an American film has come to showing an alternate twisted world, ala THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.What's also a treat here is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Icabod Crane.  He's an introverted crime solver, a quirky loner with his own little crazy nick-naks for solving a murder.  The rest of the cast is a great too.  Okay, Christina Ricci looks too much like a goth chick stuck in 1799, the year the film takes place, but, so what.  Lisa Marie (then Mrs, Burton) Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough (Whom I hope wasn't as sickly in real life as the character he depicted) Christopher Lee, Martin Landau (in an unbilled cameo) Miranda Richardson and Casper Van Dien bring it all together.",Null,0,1,18 November 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Laughs and Giggles in Megadeaths!
","Stanley Kubrick once said if you want to make a serious film about war, have the general come out of the conference room.  If you want to make a comedy about war, have the general come out of the bathroom.  I can't say anymore about this classic black comedy, that hasn't been said, other than it will NEVER feel old and dated.  Kudos to everyone involved!",Null,0,0,6 January 2001
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's best film.
","BARRY LYNDON works much diffently from a conventional film.  There is no instant gratification in Kubrick's three hour epic about an Irish rogue. It all comes slowly, and should be treated as so, like a walk through a museum. Many scenes are so beautifully slow, that it shows that Kubrick's mad-perfectist style of directing pays off.   The slowness, if taken right, without interuption, hypnotises the viewer.  By the time the film is nearly over, we are glued to the screen.  The final outcome in BARRY LYNDON, where Ryan O'Neal's title character gets his come-uppance the film has you by the throat! Kubrick's exsisting light cinematography, the set design, the incredible (and never overused) use of music makes this one of the best long epics ever made.  See it on the big screen.",Null,1,2,20 November 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," It's why we go to movies, to be entertained!
","Within ten minutes into MONSTERS, INC, you know you are in for a fun packed ride.  The town of Montropolis is powered by the energy found in children's screams.  It's up to Monsters Inc (the local power company- what ConEd is to Manhattan) to keep the city packed with screams.  It's has the wacked logic of a Gary Larson 'Far Side' cartoon come to life.  What I loved are the amazing details- the purring snakes in Celia's hair, the various shaped monsters that populate the town, the amazing facial expressions of Boo, the human child that wanders into Montropolis.   There is almost no preachy moral to the story, no real social message, just 90 minutes of endless fun (oh, and the fate that awaits the bad monster, I think I broke blood vessels laughing too hard!)",Null,0,1,7 November 2001
Armageddon," Brief review
","Basically, a high gloss remake of 'Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea', only instead of a sub going underwater, it's a space shuttle going the opposite direction.  Both have a tight time limit to save the earth from worldwide doom. All the key characters (the ones played by Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton) are straight out of a bad sit-com, very one dimensional. The closest to a fun character is Steve Buscemi, as an astronaut who slowly goes nuts.   The worst is the talented Liv Tyler, who plays a young woman whose fiancee (Affleck) and dad (Bruce) are heading the spaceship crew attempting to A Bomb blast a 'Texas-sized' meteor heading for earth.  She justs stands there, listening to very pessimistic broadcasts from the spaceship.  Her BLANK expression  makes one think director Michael Bay simply said: 'Liv, in this scene, and every scene in the movie, I want you to look like you just swallowed a pen cap.' The special effects, and pictorial design of the film are top notch. Think of it as a Visual Effects Artists' demo reel.",Null,0,1,20 November 1998
Face_Off," John Woo's best American made film.
","FACE/OFF has explosions, amazing gun battles, chases, fist-fights, speedboat chases, jet chases.   For the avergae action film-maker thats all you need. But we are talking John Woo, the greatest action director since Akira Kurosawa!  Woo gives his film fantastic character development.Here's the set-up, An FBI agent (John Travolta) hunts down the cold blooded terrorist (Nicholas Cage) who murdered his infant child years ago.  The terrorist is knocked into a coma during a chase.  The FBI know the terrorist has planted a bomb somewhere, but can't get this info out of the terroists' captured associates.  So, Travolta has to have Cage's face grafted on, take on Cage's characterisitics, and try to stop this attack.  This is a fast moving film about two dreaded enemies who have to live each other's lives, harm those they love.This is the best film directed by Hong Kong bred John Woo.   A wonderful Woo trademark is how characters and storyline are developed, changed and underlined in the midst of intense action.",Null,1,2,18 November 2001
Pearl Harbor," Well, it's kinda loud.....
","The most anticipated blockbuster (no pun intended) of the Summer 2001 season, PEARL HARBOR makes us appreciate much more, the other film depiction of the horrendous December 7th attack, TORA! TORA! TORA! Granted, the battle scenes were intense, and kept on hitting you, honestly making you feel like you were really there.  What drags the film down is the amazingly cliched romantic sub-plot.  Every 'Two military buddie smitten with the same sweetie' routine is there- the slug fest, the way war makes friends forget petty diffrences, the heroine having to give a heroic star at her boyfriends going off to war.  Director Michael Bey didn't have to treat the film as a routine formula war film.",Null,0,0,18 November 2001
Independence Day," May be noted as a Pre-Bin Ladin film.
","When I saw ID4 at a New York multiplex during it's July 1996 release, I saw the cities incinerate, and the scene fades out.  The scene fades to a shot of downtown Manhattan.   The Statue Of Liberty pops in the water as the burned out Twin Towers smoulder in the background.   Some jerk in the audience hooted an excited 'YEAHHHHH!'  I wonder where this guy is now? Maybe in search of a badly needed soul! After September 2001, how ID4 is going to feel so dated!  The post destruction humor (Will Smith with his one-liners) will seem out of place. (I hated it back in 1996) Even in 1996, characters seemed far too cheerful after major cities are attacked.       Frankly, ID4 is an oddity.  It begins as a great film with promise then decomposes. It starts with real tension as the saucers loom over our cities, and just sit there.  You get to know certain charcaters (Will Smith's pilot, Jeff Goldblum's techy guy, President Bill Pullman) You actually warm up to these people.  Then there is the attack.  It's all too realistic, sometimes frightening. Then you know what happens?  The movie falls apart, and stays in pieces.  The infantile dialog, meant to be funny one-liners feel so forced. If I was one of these stars' agent, I'd bean Dean Devlin's typewriter with a baseball bat.   The general feeling of 'we have to stick together' helps the weak second half along. After this Black Tuesday, how will ID4, DEEP IMPACT, ARMAGEDDON, DAYLIGHT, and THE MATRIX feel with their cool-looking destruction scenes?",Null,0,1,18 September 2001
JFK," A mystery, inside an enigma....
","Whether you believe Lee Harvey Oswald worked alone in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, or that a Government sponsored, and covered up plot murdered this valuable American leader, JFK will hold your interest and not let go for it's entire three hour plus running time.The basis structure of JFK is a murder mystery.  New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner's best performance) feels something is not right with the Warren Report, the Government investigation on the assassination.  He digs in to find the truth.  Like Mike Hammer, and every other detective, a thread leads to a string, which leads to a rope. Witnesses around him are being killed, and he is even threatened.  Garrison presses on to try to uncover the real assassin.   Oliver Stone's best film. With Jay O. Sanders, Jack Lemmon, Edward Asner, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, Sally Kirkland, Gary Oldman, Michael Rooker, Donald Sutherland... everybody in the cast was wonderful.",Null,0,11,19 November 2001
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo comes through, despite muddled script
","As MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 begins, Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt enjoys a vacation of mountain climbing, and leaps from cliff to cliff in a cartoon manner. Director John Woo is cleverly setting the tone for his action thriller, light, silly, not to be taken seriously. As Hunt begins to solve the mystery, everything becomes incredibly mixed up, confusing, sometimes boring.The saving grace comes at the end, with a beautifully filmed motorcycle chase.  Woo uses tracking shots, slow motion, natural sounds, all a film-maker's tools to make the film worth the price of admission.   Wish the rest of the film was as good.",Null,5,11,18 November 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Good, but not great. Over-rated
","A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is one of Stanley Kubrick's most famous films.  I feel it is tremendously flawed.  It starts off beautifully, a tale of a frightening futuristic street gang led by the twisted Alex (Malcolm McDowell) The shooting is inventive (Hey, it's Kubrick) You'll want to memorize the rapid fire dialog, made up of mostly bizarre street slang.  The music is beyond clever ('The Thieving MagPie' plays during a gang-fight.  You have to love it!) After commiting several serious brutal crimes, the police catch Alex. When an authority figure says to Alex 'Your (latest) victim has died...', the film begins to fall apart.  The jokes become cheaper, the acting way too forced (Sometimes the actors seem to be waiting for Stanley to say 'Cut') 
One of the reasons could be that Kubrick just came off the aborted NAPOLEON project in 1970, and was looking for an alternate film.  According to some of the writings on Kubrick, very little time was spent on preparing CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  But, even flawed Kubrick is much better than the average stuff out there.",Null,0,0,21 November 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Peter Rabbit for adults!
","Remember as a kid, you were read 'Peter Rabbit', about the curious, kind of loner bunny that wanders where he shouldn't, Mr.McGregor's farm?  And remember how he was chased out by the foul-tempered farmer, and became bedridden?   Well, that's the plot of EYES WIDE SHUT.   The only diffences are that Stanley Kubrick replaced the bunny with Tom Cruise, the farm becomes a Long Island orgy for the imaginative elite!  Now, because Kubrick used a bedtime story as inspiration for an erotic drama doesn't make for bad cinema.  I really liked EYES WIDE SHUT. I felt it sad that Stanley Kubrick had to die when he could of had another ten years of work in him.  I felt it sadder that he was such a friggen perfectionist, and it took him a decade to complete a film!  In the span since he made the chilling FULL METAL JACKET in 1987 to this film 12 years later, lesser directors like Paul Verhoven, Brian DePalma and Adrian Lyne worked round the clock to make ho-hum cinema.     EYES shows that Kubrick didn't die on a downward spin.",Null,0,0,7 February 2001
Pulp Fiction," A contender for 'The Best Film of the 1990's'
","The absolute strong point of Quentin Tarantino's superb PULP FICTION is it's Oscar winning screenplay.  Had this screenplay been submitted to a screenwriting teacher, it would of gotten a D-.  It destroys all conventional writing rules.  Within twenty minutes of the film, we have been introduced to at least five barely linking major characters.  It's heavy on talk (But what talk!)  By the time the supposed lead (John Travolta as a cool moving hit-man/drug abuser) and his 'date' (Uma Thurman as a gangster's wife) win the dance contest, you are saying 'I am forty-five minutes into this film.  I have no idea what is going on, but I love it!'       PULP FICTION took the old textbooks on screenwriting, and burned it, stomped on the remains, and kicked it down the drain.  It wrote a new book on screenwriting, making it one of the most important films in American Cinema.",Null,0,1,19 November 2001
War of the Worlds," Best film of 2005
","In one scene from WAR OF THE WORLDS, my favorite 2005 release, a frazzled military man shouts: 'Our weapons have no effect on them! Just help the citizens escape!' That's the tone of Steven Spielberg's often disturbing and scary take on H.G Wells' story about a massive worldwide alien invasion. Like Wells' story, our emotions almost never focus on scientists and military men. The center of attention here is an ordinary family man (Tom Cruise) protecting his children from unbeatable, hate-filled aliens. We see very little of us fighting back. Spielberg aims his camera at helpless, very often doomed people trying to escape and shield their loved ones.2005 saw the release of two excellent fantasy remakes, this one, and Peter Jackson's KING KONG. Spielberg and Jackson obviously both love the original versions of their big budgeted and effect-filled remakes. They never took the sneering tone of 'Well, we have better special effects than what they had way back then, so nyah-nyah!'WAR OF THE WORLDS never takes the ultra-cool, spoofy tone of alien invasion films like INDEPENDENCE DAY. This time it's very cold and dark! You truly get the idea that these are final days for the human race.",10,0,2,21 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the recent bunch!
","The best of the recent three Star Wars films, STAR WARS: EPISODE THREE: REVENGE OF THE SITH delivers with zest, you can't keep your eyes or emotions off it. It's 140 minute running time flies by even for the non Star Wars fans. Young Annakin Skywalker, along with his mentor, Obi-Won return from a stunning aerial and hand-to-hand inter-plantary battle. The high point of Annakin's return is his loving, pregnant wife. What follows is Annakin's descent from a warm-hearted returning warrior to becoming the heartless Darth Vader.Director George Lucas (who also makes an un-billed cameo as alien royalty) keeps the film's pace at high energy. I haven't seen so much cross-cutting between chases and battles since INTOLORENCE or IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD. The preview screening I attended in New York had heavy security. No camera phones, or recording devices were allowed in a theatre. A theatre empl0yee assured the audience the FBI and NYPD were present during the screening. At least they got to sit through a very exciting movie.",9,7,15,5 May 2005
Kagemusha," A wonderful return for a fi master
","A samurai warlord stares at his exact double, a recently captured petty thief. Before long, the warlord is assassinated. In order to hide this new weak link, the warlord's advisors hire the thief as a substitute. What follows is in unforgettable study of power-thirst and the folly of war. This is KAGEMUSHA, the comeback film for master film-maker Akira Kurosawa.In the late 1970's George Lucas, and Francis Coppola, fresh from conquering Hollywood with their films, watched in dismay as the Japanese film industry regarded Akira Kurosawa as an unmarketable relic. Kurosawa, who bought the Japanese film industry worldwide recognition with his 1950 film RASHOMON, was now being turned away by every Japanese studio for his latest film project. Both Lucas and Coppola borrowed furiously from Kurosawa films (STAR WARS is almost a remake of THE HIDDEN FORTRESS and SEVEN SAMURAI) Coppola's THE GODFATHER has numerous Kurosawa-styled moments. Lucas and Coppola came to the rescue with international distribution deals. This resulted in KAGEMUSHA, Kurosawa's long-planned samurai epic, becoming a reality. During KAGEMUSHA's 'Development Hell' period, Kurosawa made over 200 color drawings of key scenes in the film. The resulting film is a marvel of color usage, shot composition, and character blocking. Tatsuya Nakadai, a veteran of Kurosawa's films (he's the gun-happy punk in YOJIMBO and the cool Tokyo detective in HIGH AND LOW) is both the ill-fated warlord and the mangy thief. With two character arcs to deal with, Nakadai helps to keep the film pulsating.",8,1,5,28 May 2005
Ran," Be prepared to be awe-struck!
","With RAN (1985) Akira Kurosawa seems to be setting up a macarbe trap.  The first section of the film is slow, following an aging warlord (Tatsuya Nakadai's best acting in a long wonderous career.) dividing his castles amongst his unsavory sons.  The action is slow, people talk in low tones, it's almost at snail's pace.  But then, a battle scene like nothing you ever seen before explodes on the screen.  The film takes a 180 degree turn and becomes more and more sinister, more compelling.  You can't look away. 
Akira Kurosawa (1910-1997) was responsible for elevating Japanese cinema to a front-runner in world cinema.  Two of his films, RASHOMON and SEVEN SAMURAI were made in less than ten years after World War II.  These films put a spotlight on Japanese culture.  Some of his later films, THE HIDDEN FORTRESS, THE BAD SLEEP WELL, YOJIMBO and HIGH AND LOW became the basis for a good percentage of the major American films produced after 1960.If you sit down to see RAN, be prepared for a jaw-dropping experience.",Null,60,75,20 November 2001
Saboteur," Unheralded masterwork
","SABOTEUR has been unjustly called a 'poor man's 39 STEPS'.  It is a visually powerful spy/chase thriller.  The thriller genre would not see another film with such bold eye candy and fast story-telling until Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST or the James Bond series.An innocent American factory worker (Robert Cummings) is wrongly accused of sabotaging a factory, causing a few deaths.  While he is hunted across the country, he has to find the real culprits.The film has famous hero/villian show downs (in a noisy Radio City Music Hall, atop the Statue of Liberty, in a cramped van)  It also has bizarre humor (Get a load of the henchmen purring out love songs amongst themselves, a Nazi spy reflecting on his mom dressing him in drag.)

Jurassic Park," A wonderful, slightly flawed dino-treat
","JURASSIC PARK is a ton of fun.  Steven Spielberg has created a thrilling roller-coaster ride of a movie.  The basic setting is a island compound that allows people to interact with living dinosaurs.  The only problem with the film is it's a roller coaster ride, and should be just that.  Spielberg tried to add an extra message that 'We shouldn't mess with nature.....'  I think the breath-taking dinosaur vs. our heroes scenes proved that enough.       Sam Niel and Laura Dern are terrific leads.  Jeff Goldblum (in a role he'd almost repeat in ID4), Samuel Jackson and Sir Richard Attenbourgh fill out the top notch cast.",Null,2,4,19 November 2001
