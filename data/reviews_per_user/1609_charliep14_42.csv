The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Transition Episode
","This episode serves to move the story along - and does it well. It is served by a great cast : we're happy to see the now familiar faces and some new characters are introduced with good casting. The high point of the movie is the usage of propaganda from both sides of the conflict - this will what one will remember from this installment of the series While it is a good episode for the Hunger Games saga, it is not as exciting as the first two - the action that gripped us is simply not there. Also, definitely do not start Hunger Games with this movie; I imagine it would be virtually impossible to enjoy if you don't know the characters and context. Not a disappointment but definitely can't wait to have a stronger episode next!",7,8,23,23 November 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Good but fairly standard
","Perhaps the race to more incredible stunts, more world threatening menaces is influencing our opinion of this movie in 2015 ; 9 years after its release, but the movie lacks a certain punch and weight. It's perfectly enjoyable, well put together and a couple of cool scenes are sure to be found but overall, it feels very forgettable. Another gripe with the movie: outside of Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames, the cast is very 'faceless' and also highly forgettable. Even Hoffman, who could have been the greatest villain ever, was not very convincing. What is good about the movie is the classic Impossible Mission stuff : the masks, the music, the 'Tom Cruise running' scene is almost ludicrous but still highly enjoyable. Watch it if you like the series, you won't be disappointed but don't go out of your way to find it.",6,0,0,10 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Let's try to be positive
","It's fashionable to bash this movie... and it does give you a lot of things to do so. However; let's try to be positive: - It's actually cool to meet the Jedi Council and the characters are mostly very strong. Qi Gong Jin / Liam Neeson is a very good Jedi indeed. - Darth Maul; the last lightsaber battle and some part of the last fight scene are very enjoyable indeed. - George Lucas going very far in his imagination, adding lots of new settings, races, designs etc etc. The excitement is presentBUT BUT BUT - Jar Jar is really the most annoying character ever. Anakin a close second - The humor just falls flat. Flat out sucks actually. - 'Too digital'. Some parts look like a video game. - Very convoluted: too much politics, too complicated. So yeah, overall, it's an annoying sci if movie with some good stuff. Still is below average. As a Star Wars movie... it doesn't deliver.",4,2,6,19 December 2015
Skyfall," Simply excellent
","Sam Mendes takes the Daniel Craig reboot up another level by embracing some of the James Bond's roots while keeping the fresh, modern take of the character established in Casino Royale & Quantum of Solace. Like all good Bond movies, the audience travel throughout the world, through some great set pieces. There were also some truly epic scenes: the opening scene and the London Tube in particular come to mind. The villain was incredible: creepy and modern but at the same way a little over the top ridiculous at heart. One could only regret a few longish moments and the lack of a strong female lead but minor qualms for what is probably the best Bond flick.",9,3,8,14 November 2015
Akira," Awesome. Hasn't aged a bit
","Hadn't watched Akira for years and years. Managed to catch a 'clean' version - very well restored, hi def and all the works and honestly it hasn't aged at all. On the contrary, with the exception of one scene where a girl talks a public phone, the whole thing has aged gracefully and is still as relevant as it was in the late 1980's: the animation is flawless, the designs as cool and modern as ever and the action flat out awesome. The story is still what one could have qualms about - the debate is the same as 25 years ago. It does have slow & confusing moments but overall it's well worth a watch. Now I'll go ahead and reread everything! Katsushiro Otomo : I wish you were doing more!",8,1,4,4 October 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Interesting change of tone yet remains so Tarantino
","Couple things up front:<ul><li>This is not the movie that will make you like Tarantino if you are cold to his style - this is not a movie for the historically accurate aficionados</li></ul>But it's good. Came in with low expectations: not my favorite cast for a Tarantino joint; the WWII setting is a tricky one; etc. but the Tarantino magic brings it together with his typical strengths: strong scenes & pacings, impeccable use of music and some fascinating characters. Some of them are a bit on the corny side but the Tarantino humour makes it work. Recommended.",9,0,4,14 May 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," As good as candy...
","Rogue one is a fun movie. It has fantastic action scenes, a great cast of secondary characters (Donnie!!!) and plays on the nostalgia of all the vehicles & sets of the original trilogy beautifully. It is so cool to see the original stormtroopers, AT-AT and other AT-ST. It also features probably the grimmest war scene of any Star Wars movie. Almost reminiscent of Private Ryan in certain aspects; it is violent -definitely not for kids- and very well made. This scene makes the movie.It's hard to point out what's wrong with the movie. It is like candy because, even though it is good, it lacks a point or purpose? Yes, it is a spin off and about the extended universe. But would one enjoy Rogue one without being familiar with anything from the franchise? It does lack some elements that make Star Wars great: - the characters don't really fit in the bigger picture... so why do you really care? - the music is clearly not John Williams, that's a pretty big letdown. - the main characters are ... not as good as the ones from Episode 7So yes, good movie, great visuals, fun times... but 'Empire Strikes Back' it is not!",7,1,5,19 December 2016
The Hunger Games," Fun movie, good set up of the characters
","Watched this movie a couple of times over a few years. The first time was a delightful surprise. I had discounted Hunger Games as adolescent but ended being very much captivated by the Games and growing fond of the Catniss in particular.Subsequent viewings make the games less enthralling - at the end of the day Battle Royale does it better - but the movie absolutely works as a set up piece for what is to come in subsequent movies. The world is clearly defined, the politics and intrigues well positioned and the characters are introduced strongly in a way you understand and want to root for them. This + a good cliffhanger ending make it a solid movie.",8,1,4,20 November 2015
Zootopia," Nice surprise
","Used to be Pixar was the far better animation studio at Disney but recently they've been knocking them out of the park with their own Disney Studio Productions! Zootopia is a great illustration: it's fun, witty, has the several layers of interpretation and looks really good.In a nutshell, it's a great animation for the entire family. The only thing one could poke is the cast: it's fairly unknown and not really inspired. Jason Bateman is the only stand out, Nate Lawrence is good in a role that almost sounds like Jonah Hill. The rest, including the title character and an underwhelmed Idris Elba is a little -meh-.But it's probably the only point that one could expect better from. The rest is good fun.",7,1,8,22 May 2016
Creed," The other great reboot of 2015!
","Unexpected and almost as pleasing as Star Wars: Rocky was also back in 2015!It was good to go back into this universe: setting up a new generation is done smartly: using Creed as a main character allowed for a richer playground, a richer set of elements to toy with and a way to build relationships in a deeper manner that would have been the case with using 'simply' Rocky's son. Michael B Jordan is good, still some progress to do (some scenes are a little clich√© due to his acting perhaps?) but Stallone is a real nice surprise. He's quiet, wise and yet inspirational and true to the modest roots of the character. A familiar plot actually works. You go along the training and fight scenes with a similar smile on your face as you did in the 80s watching Rocky fight Appolo, Mister T etc. Good stuff.",8,0,2,18 March 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," is it a comedy or a superhero movie?
","On the positive side, Thor Ragnarok looks fantastic. One also can't say it's a boring movie: lots of things happen, lots of jokes are cracked, lots of action scenes etc etc. Also, it's obvious the Director and the Team are having fun with it. So, yes, it's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imaginationBUT... I left feeling like the movie was treating Thor like the butt of a joke? The Director has so much fun with the material he forgot to take it seriously, and, by the same token to give it any kind of weight. Loki was a major threat in many Marvel movies and now is either a C Grade villain or B Grade sidekick; worlds explode and this basically only the source of a joke, etc. Nothing is taken seriously so it's almost too light. At best you feel like you're watching a children's movie, at worst you feel like you're watching a comedy that disguised itself as a superhero movie?",7,3,12,1 November 2017
Cloverfield," Cool Rewrite of Godzilla
","When you see this in 2016, the first thing that jumps at you is the found film footage: this concept has simply aged badly. The camera work is voluntary choppy etc. but we've seen it so many times by now that it's old and stale. By 2008 it wasn't exactly revolutionary either - that's really the main issue with Cloverfield. It's a shame because it is a cool rewrite of the classic Godzilla concept: the monster is cool, the FX are cool, the cast is cool... lots of things to like really. It does follow the tropes: idiot characters going upstream to find a girlfriend, lots of carnage... but it works. To be honest, I think I prefer the sequel: it's cleverer but this is still a cool way to spend a Sunday afternoon.",6,0,0,10 July 2016
Suicide Squad," This movie is such a mess...
","Where to start... Suicide Squad is a mess; you can feel the multiple rewrites, the three re-edits ('oh, Deadpool did well, we need more jokes.' 'Oh Batman vs Superman was panned by critics, we need to be like that' etc etc.) leaving this movie completely disjointed; all over the place. The multiple edits and re-shoots are physically visible in the movie - it takes you out of the film completely.I won't even mention the story - it's pointless. But story is never really what Suicide Squad is supposed to be about: The characters are. And this is one of the first major flaws of this movie: the characters are clearly separated into A grade - basically Will Smith, B Grade - Harley Quinn and then Z Grade: the rest of them. The Z Grades fight for 5% screen time and therefore become meaningless cannon fodder: they don't stand for anything, are completely undeveloped and thoroughly uninteresting. In certain cases they look bad (Killcroc) and are stupid clich√©s (Katana speaks Japanese and has a sword... ugh)Even Will Smith & Harley Quinn don't really work. They're supposed to be villains... they're not. There isn't a single thing bad Deadshot Will has done in this movie. This means that the entire premise of Suicide Squad doesn't stand: they're not bad guys! They don't do anything bad! And don't get me started on the villain: idiotic and over-powerful yet super easy to defeat...!Visually the movie is in the same vain as the recent DC offerings but...somewhat less impressive? The characters look off, the effects are super dark and underwhelming...the super hero abilities fall flat...Suicide Squad does have some redeeming qualities... but they are very few and far between and contingent on you liking the source material and the characters. Pass.",3,3,6,11 August 2016
American Sniper," A masterpiece
","This movie is a must see. Bradley Cooper's performance was definitely worth the Oscar - he delivers such intensity in his performance that manages to transport you and fascinate you at the same time. This intensity is one of the key factors this movie is successful. On top of this he is literally transformed - to the point it's hard to think you're watching the same actor you're familiar with. A truly unique performance. American Sniper is a war movie at its best: it is gut wrenching, hard to watch at some points an beautiful in its mise en sc√®ne and reconstruction of war torn landscapes and sets of conflict. Eastwood is a proved strong director and this another great movie - a high point in my opinion.",9,24,44,1 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode I but ...
","The fundamental issue with this movie is its main character and main actor. Very honestly, H.Christensen is a bad choice for the lead of this movie -he doesn't have the range (at least in this movie) necessary to pull of a character as complex and conflicted as Anakin Skywalker.So the confusion and internal struggle the character is supposed to go through falls flat and you are left with someone who appears arrogant and quite honestly just an overconfident brat. A long way from a Jedi master (which is wanted I guess...?) but also a long way from the noble villain he's supposed to become. When this fails, it's hard to enjoy the movie. It has some flaws similar to the Episode I (too digital being the main one) but does improve on many things: Fan Service is full speed and you get to see Yoda, Bobba Fett etc. in their peak. But a slow pace, a hard to swallow romance and the afore mentioned problems don't save it from being average at best... +1 point because it's Star Wars!",6,0,6,20 December 2015
Ant-Man," Too cute for its own good...
","Unfortunately, this felt too much like a kids' movie. A lot of the special effects are strong reminders of 'Honey I shrunk the Kids' and the humor dial is turned way up to the point of it feels like the movie makes fun of itself? Though this could have been good, it minimizes the impact of the action scenes and the overall weight of the threats etc. What was good was the cast : Michael Douglas is great as Hank Pym and does overshadow Paul Rudd who, when taken by himself, works as Scott Lang. A fantastic 'surprise' at mid movie (the part the Marvel Zombies will prefer I think) and some cool moments help make this not a complete waste but, honestly, I was hoping for more. A note on the soundtrack: it wasn't very good + I don't understand why ants sound like Jurassic World's dinosaurs?",5,14,35,26 July 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," More Spy Movie than Action Movie this time around
","Despite what the trailer sells, this movie is less action oriented than the two previous installments. Now, the few action scenes are absolutely fantastic and continue the over the top signature that Tom cruise and the Mission Impossible franchise have established but there are a lot more 'spy scenes' this time around: Rebecca Ferguson plays a very ambiguous / mysterious character, there is some political intrigue. Overall, though I understand the disappointment of some action lovers the story is not bad or simplistic. It's of course not an philosophical study of human nature but it's actually well done and well told. My only gripe with the movie is the lack of the obligatory Mission Impossible tropes: where is the scene where Tom falls from high above to a few millimeters from the ground? Where is the scene where he runs for miles and miles? Over than that, a good summer movie - not quite to the level of Ghost Protocol but enjoyable nonetheless.",7,1,3,13 August 2015
Captain America: Civil War," A great movie, definitely better than Age of Ultron
","Captain America : Civil War was much better than anyone expected to be. After the semi disappointment of Age of Ultron which didn't have much of a point and a fairly underwhelming cast of new characters, Civil War actually delivers a strong Avengers movie: there have never been that many superheroes on screen and the Civil War plot - though quite different to the comic book version - provides a good premise for the conflict.The brothers Russo deliver a similar joy to the first Avengers with the superhero fighting each other scenes. Actually the action scenes in general are great (like they were in Winter Soldier), action packed and fast paced. Great stuff for the fan-boys that wanted that.The new characters, namely Black Panther and Spider-Man are absolutely fantastic. Of course Spider-Man is more exciting - great costume! great quips! he's so young he feels like the 1960s' version! - but Black Panther shouldn't be short changed: he's elegant and charismatic - not unlike Captain America.But two things bring the movie down a little: the pacing. The plot is complex (too complex for a superhero flick?) so you get a lot of exposition and 'talking head scenes'... your mileage may vary but don't expect non stop action for 2hours; this is not it. And then there is the end... no spoilers, but it's quick and a little 'under the rug'.Oh and yes, one thing: it's not technically a Civil War, it's a 2 hour battle! Other than that, fun fun movie with a clear focus on Captain America, and a lot of cool shots for the fan-boys in the audience.",8,4,9,30 April 2016
Quantum of Solace," Critics were too harsh with this movie?
","Perhaps due to the strong wake up call / reboot generated by Casinio Royale, the stakes were too high for Quantum of Solace. Perhaps it also came too soon after-wards. It is however not a bad Bond movie or bad action flick at all. Lots of good points to consider: a strong cast. The Bond girl and the villain were in my humble opinion better than their Casino counterparts (evil french always work!). The cinematography was interesting too: there was a grain and a color palette that almost gave a retro/vintage look to this movie which worked particularly well. Also, strong pacing - also better than Casino Royale where you had a few looong moments.Overall not a bad flick - it maybe doesn't leave you with a long lasting memory but, re-watch it, it's not bad at all.",7,3,6,12 November 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Impossible at its best!
","The first half of the movie is probably the best action movie of the last 20 years. It is intense, well shot, engaging and absolutely stunning visually. The stunts and action set in Budapest, Moscow and Dubai and are absolutely fantastic and make the movie. Unfortunately the movie slows down greatly in the second half of the movie (or is it two thirds/one third?) in Mumbai and loses itself in some common genre traps: too much explaining stuff that doesn't make sense and some fairly 'average' action. It's a small gripe, probably half explained by the fantastic beginning of the movie. The cast is the best of the series: Jeremy Renner is a good addition, Lea Seydoux is a pretty cool villain and the female lead whose name escapes me is somebody I wish I would have seen in another movie? And Cruise is Cruise, he's the man in this saga. A great movie overall, well done Brad Bird!",8,22,25,11 August 2015
22 Jump Street," Good fun
","Less inspired than the first 21 Jump Street for a good chunk of the movie; 22 Jump Street is a a tad bit too long for what it is. This movie begins to shine in the third tier and the final couple of scenes where the action picks up, the jokes are more fun. There it catches again the funny irreverent clich√© tone of the first movie and becomes truly enjoyable. The high school setting was better exploited than the college setting of this movie; which is why it's slower to start. Also, while fully assumed by the movie, the repetition from the first movie reinforce the slow start. Overall still OK and a perfect movie to lazy out in front of. Wait to have forgotten the first one before you watch.",7,0,1,18 January 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," Underwhelming ... but has some moments for the fans
","X-Men: Apocalypse is not a bad movie... However it's going to be difficult to write a review that doesn't dwell on the negatives.First things first: the plot is way too simplistic. Introduce bad guy, gather protagonists, gather antagonists, fight. That's literally it. One could say it's a good change of pace from the way- too-complicated-for-their-own-good other superhero offerings seen recently but in this case it feels flat and linear.The cast is basically the same as X-Men: First Class. Magneto / Fassbender and Xavier / McAvoy are still good but it feels like Jennifer Lawrence doesn't want to be here? She's supposed to be jaded in this movie but plays the jaded Mystique maybe a little too well...? In terms of characters: Quicksilver is still the greatest speedster ever on the small or big screen; Bravo to Synger on his interpretation of ultimate speed and how that could basically make you almighty. Well done.The rest of the characters are somewhat disappointing: the X-Men offer so many possibilities but it looks like we are limited to that leather look introduced by Synger 15 years ago. He invented the modem super hero movie look but now he is limited to the style he invented? The costumes are a bit ridiculous and Apocalypse is the best illustration of that: Oscar Isaac looks a bit odd...kind of off. And you get that across Psylocke and her way too small panties look, angel's techno wings etc etc. Today, the X-Men could look better. And don't get me started on the blue gang (Beast and Diablo don't feel real; they really never did...)For the good: a lot of Easter eggs and fan service. The Wolverine scene is fantastic for those who know the source material. The end fight is satisfactory... but it's difficult not to be underwhelmed.The X-Men need to be reinvented on the silver screen. Fox needs to go back to that glimpse that First Class offered and that was forgotten too soon after. We need something new; no more 'Magneto is not a bad guy really!' ' But he kills' that we've been served for 15 years. Time for a reboot. The source material is great and deserves it.",6,16,32,22 May 2016
Logan," A little underwhelmed...
","Maybe it's a case of high expectations, but I was underwhelmed overall with this movie. It has ramp-ed up the violence to the max and the end is quite good but too many problems mar this movie to make it a hit: - the setting never quite clicks: 12 years in the future they have the same phones and the same TVs? Mutantkind was eradicated? Not a big deal but it never seems right - the movie is a road movie? An action movie? A mix of the both with a lot of dead times and fairly filler moments - What it is not is a super hero movie. It has some of its tropes but lacks the overall sense of wonderment a superhero flick needs - The bad guys and main threat are really **meh** So yeah Hugh Jackman is OK, Patrick Stewart is OK, seeing a Wolverine unleashed on the screen has its moments but overall somewhat disappointed.",6,4,11,4 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Disappointing but saved by the last act
","Halfway through the movie, yes, I was disappointed. Avengers 2 falls into the common super hero movie trap of spending too much time explaining technology / fantasy (a McGuffin basically) that will never make sense. And it is frustrating and slow at times because of that. If you add to this some disappointments vs. what was promised in the trailer and some not so exciting new characters (first time for me in a marvel movie...) Avengers 2 does fail to deliver. BUT BUT a great third act and final fight scene save the movie for Marvel zombies such as myself. Truly epic, great Whedon-esque character dynamic and team ups. The movie does offer a lot to like: a fantastic James Spader as Ultron, Hawkeye! (How can Whedon make Hawkeye actually rule!)... However this is the not the best marvel movie. Will still go see it again in Paris next week. PS: Bryan Singer did Quicksilver better than Whedon....",7,3,8,3 May 2015
Sicario," Strong & Smart
","As is often the case with Denis Villeneuve movies, Sicario grabs you almost violently into its universe, captivates you and stays with you for a while after you have watched it. And it's really the mark of a great movie isn't it? It has a great and fantastic score that creates the mood, fantastic color (some saturation √† la breaking bad in the Arizona desert etc.) and such a great cast. Sicario is a great 'cartel' movie, a great police piece and will make you think. I'm not making it full points because there are a couple of details that didn't make sense... perhaps I should watch it again very soon!",8,1,2,29 February 2016
Departures," A beautiful & poetic movie ... but has some issues
","Okuribo has many qualities of classic, beautiful Japanese movies: a quiet rhythm that brings you along gently, a poetic setting re- enforced by the Japanese countryside so typical and so beautiful to look at.Seasons and the passing time, as is sometimes the case, play a great role in the movie. The topic of death is treated gently and beautifully, full of emotions and, again, poetry. What doesn't work is once in a while the jarring change of tones. One can argue this is Japanese as well, but it can be done better. The characters can sometimes be overdone, contributing to these moments where the poesy is broken.But it's still a great movie - you will cry! - well worth watching.",7,0,1,18 March 2016
Sausage Party," This is NOT a kid's movie
","I went into the movie cold, with no idea what to expect and... wow. Sausage party is offensive, it's lewd and... it's also very very funny.Most people expect a certain level of decorum when watching a cartoon and this movie just goes completely against that. It's shocking more in what the movie chooses to show rather than what it says and it is shocking because, yeah, it's a cartoon.It's a rare thing to laugh so much. You will need to switch on your teenager stoner sense of humor but, it is funny. Honestly, it just is! It is incredibly immature and yes it is somewhat offensive and hardcore but it's funny. When was the last time a movie made you laugh and go 'WOW I can't believe they went that far' straight for 90mn?Super star cast, Salma Hayek as the lesbian taco is the best - just keep the kids away.",8,4,8,13 November 2016
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A little anticlimactic
","This movie didn't really work as a stand alone movie: it's just the final act in a saga that was obviously stretched out too much. As a third of a two movie Hobbit saga it would have been a much different thing. As a movie in and of itself, it's just too drawn out. Add to that the fact that we have now seen 12+ hours of elves, orcs & trolls fighting each other, it was unsurprising. Though beautifully shot, with great effects, and the cast & characters arguably more likable than the Lord of the Rings saga, it has good things going for it, but ultimately this third Hobbit movie is probably the weakest of both JRR Tolkien / Peter Jackson sagas.",6,1,2,7 January 2015
Arrival," Smart Sci Fi
","Dennis Villeneuve delivers - the kid is good!This is the intellectual kind of sci-fi, the kind that takes its time, that makes you think, that tries to bring the genre and thinking forward. The language angle is fascinating and fun to explore. Amy Adams plays the linguist fantastically well and Villeneuve's decision to stick the camera 95% on her is incredibly strong at building tension and a connection with the character. The opening scene where you actually don't see the aliens arriving but simply Adams' interaction with the world reacting to the arrival is simply fantastic.There is only one issue with the movie: purpose of the aliens. Without spoiling it's hard to get into but the conclusion is a little light for the aliens let's say to remain vagueOther than that, fantastic movie, worth a couple of screenings!",8,1,6,11 December 2016
Wonder Woman," Some major major flaws in this movie
","Surprised by the early positive vibe around this movie. I want to like it more, share the enthusiasm but... Wonder Woman has incredibly severe flaws that can't make it a *good* movie by any stretch of the imagination. Probably the biggest issue is the acting. Both leads have very limited acting skills... It takes you out of the movie more often than once. Some scenes are forced, some dialogue overdone like an SNL skit... simply not possible. The ultimate bad guy is a joke. Straight out of GOD OF WAR PlayStation game (really). Not credible for a second.And, also, on a more personal note, this is the moment where I realized the Zack Snyder school of filming action movies needs to be abandoned. Over abundant jumping, too heavy slo-mo... after three? four? movies of that; it's time to retire it. It's a shame really because the movie started well enough: having a female lead was great; the Greek mythology clicked for the most part and the World War I setting was nice. The character is also fantastic. Which is why it deserved better It's only average unfortunately. **cue in the annoying guitar rift**",5,2,10,10 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Lots of things to like... but far from perfect
","Haters will hate and this movie is being a little too harshly criticized. It is severely flawed:<ul><li>It is long; too long; mainly because it does have a lot of disposable scenes that do not contribute to the movie. Batman v. Superman doesn't deserve an extended version; it actually needs a better, more coherent compact version </li></ul><ul><li>Somewhat linked but Z.Snyder has thrown in too much stuff in this movie. It lacks structure and plot coherence.</li></ul><ul><li>Some pieces just don't work: the bat-mobile chase scene looks way too digital. The car lacks weight and the scene lacks realism.</li></ul>But but it does have a lot to like too!<ul><li>For the geeks &amp; fans: it is so cool to see some scenes that are too the exact replica of shots in the comics. Whether it's Alex Ross' Superman coming from the sky to the end (no spoiler) it's something that is just cool to see when you are familiar with the source material. </li></ul><ul><li>It builds on the Superman movie and creates the Justice League in a way that is actually satisfying! When was the last time anybody was excited about the DC Movie universe? - I actually do like Batfleck and the cast in this movie. Ben Affleck grits his teeth a little too much but is credible as a battle worn Batman... and Gail Gadot is just perfect as Wonder Woman - No spoiler but the end was good and poignant.</li></ul><ul><li>the fight scenes are cool. Snyder knows how to do those. </li></ul>Overall, comic book fans have to see it... for the rest, if you're willing to sit through a (too) long superhero movie; there is still some fun to be had.",6,1,2,29 March 2016
Casino Royale," Great reboot but no the greatest movie
","This is the perfect example of how to reboot a franchise: Casino Royale has brought Bond to the twenty first century: made it modern and relevant to a new generation of movie goers; in sync with its time and without some of the corny gadgets etc. that old school fans love but just show their age.The first third of the movie goes back to the beginnings of the characters, effectively reintroduces him, makes him fresh and young while serving great action scenes, cool settings and overall very good pacing.The second act somewhat loses its way: the at-first-entertaining poker scenes become unnecessarily convoluted -one could even forget why they are playing in the first place- and the love interest is a little forced.It does get better in the final act: back to the cool action and dramatic pacing. Overall a great Bond film - but not without its flaws ; like the title character?",7,1,5,11 November 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A good way to relaunch the saga
","JJ Abrams is smart about how he plays with the toys he was given. If I had one criticism about this movie; it's to be too classic in its structure - no spoiler but the movie will feel very familiar. On the other hand, what is the right balance to strike between old & new? There is new in this movie - lots of it. The new characters are strong and different from their elders. The settings are cool, the Star Wars technology and designs amazing (there will be so many new toys from this movie!)But Abrams manages to weave the old in ways that please and bring a smile to the hardcore fans. That was very well done. And the end scene is amazing and poignant. I need to probably re-watch it but day 1, first screening I left happy to have spent two new hours in the much beloved Star Wars Universe - I guess this is what matters.",8,13,47,16 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A very ambitious movie & quite enjoyable
","They tried to fit in a lot in this movie. As such, the main issue with Hunger Games: Catching Fire is its length. Your mileage may vary but it does feel long at times.Not that it's boring at all: what it does it does quite well : set up the rebellion, introduce us to new key characters and another round of fighting!Without spoiling: though this second edition of the Games is less exciting than the first one (mostly because we've been through this recently), it is a key episode and kicks off the 'true' hunger games story very aptly.One can understand why they decided to split the third tome into two movies when watching the second movie: it does a lot but it is still quite successful.",7,1,6,24 November 2015
Life," It's fun and not pretentious... but lacks ambition
","In 2017, there is a case to be made about movies that are fairly short, fun and easy to watch. In a world in which every action or sci-fi is 2 and a half hour long, a short 1h30 romp is refreshing. It's intense for most of its run, with a 'life' that is a fairly good antagonist and a cast that is surprisingly 'quality' for a B level movie like this one. The main issue is that you've already seen this movie... It's Aliens in a Gravity setting. It's a gentle horror sci fi flick that never really surprises...to the end. But it's good fun, so why not?",6,2,5,9 June 2017
Deadpool," Not for everyone
","The first reaction watching this movie, from quite early on, is 'where did they get the movie to make it?!'. Deadpool is a niche movie: it is for aging super hero fans, who like their violence and their geekie references. It can't by definition for everyone. If you are a in the targeted audience, then it's really fun: the jokes work, the violence is enjoyable and Ryan Reynolds delivers. You can tell he's passionate.It is not a GREAT movie either: you can feel some budget constraints + honestly the villains aren't that bad. I was however giggling the whole way and liked this fresh (at least on the silver screen) take on Marvel. Recommended",8,8,22,14 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Over the top and so much fun
","This is a crazy movie and is definitely too much - but in a very good way. If you don't like violence, over the top characters and plots, pass your way. If you do enjoy fun, old school, aesthetically gorgeous sets and direction and superbly choreographed fight scenes, this is for you. Though some of these moments were not always too my liking, it's hard to deny the pleasure you have watching this movie. The makers of the movie were all in great form: Millar's script is craziness at its best, and it is paired with Vaughn's superb eye and perfect pacing. Colin Firth was a great choice for the main character and Samuel L Jackson is obviously having fun. A winning spy movie, action movie, superhero movie, all rolled into one.",8,5,13,1 March 2015
Minions," Not as funny as the trailer let it to be
","The movie is good for a few chuckles and does have some very entertaining moments. What is actually by far the funniest is the 'minion speak'; especially if you understand some french, it does have some layers in it (Papaout√©; c'estparl√† etc.) and is definitely funny. It also is a very beautiful CG movie. Though it is customary to say that with every new CG movie, this one is absolutely gorgeous, with some great character designs and some cool visuals. But, honestly, didn't laugh all that often. The trailer lets you believe it will be a very very funny movie and was not, it was a cool adventure with some funny characters - left me wanting more. The voice acting was also, with the exception of the minions, nothing incredible.",6,2,2,29 August 2015
Spectre," Another great installment in the 007 franchise by Sam Mendes
","I entered the theater worried; thinking it would be difficult to top Skyfall (or even to do as good) and I must admit after the first viewing: Spectre delivers.Spectre builds on the first three Daniel Craig installments of the 007 reboot, tying everything together in a nice way - immediately giving the movie weight and a sense of purpose. For longer term fans, it is also a nice way to give a nod to the past, with a villain everyone will recognize quickly.The movie also features everything one likes about the reboot - the gritty action, the world traveling etc. but builds on it: the best Bond Girl in a long while, C.Waltz delivers as the crazy villain and few but cool gadgets. Overall very cool. It had two or three 'down' moments but overall, whatever, I came out with a smile on my face and happy about James Bond!",9,49,99,15 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Beautiful and crazy in all the right ways!
","Mad Max is not supposed to be about convoluted plot lines, talking heads scenes and a world that makes sense. What it is supposed to be: over the top post apocalyptic world, punk / heavy metal imagery , cars, trucks and bikes and all that good stuff. And this movie delivers: the plot line is super thin but gives you what you want: a 2 hour car chase through the desert with absolutely stunning stunts, beautiful shots and crazy crazy CRAZY characters, designs and action. Furiosa / Charlize Theron was a surprising choice but works quite well and is the main character of the movie. This is my only beef with the movie: Tom Hardy could have had more impact / be more present as Max. Other than that, 2 hours of pure fun.",9,6,14,23 May 2015
Sully," The Content is better than the movie
","Not sure I understand the positive reviews this movie gets. Or maybe I do: it rides on Eastwood's talent as a director and Hanks' talent as an actor. Yes 'Sully' does offer some nice visuals, good directing - there is no denying Clint Eastwood is a great director. Similarly, Hanks' portrayal as Sully is good - no denying this.But this movie is far from being the best from both of them. The story ends abruptly and easily - making the whole plot seem a little shaky to begin with. And Hanks is a cool composed pilot. And that's basically it.The landing scenes are impressive and there's no denying the story of the miracle on the Hudson is worth telling...but it feels like this could have been a 30 minute documentary. Not sure the movie actually builds anything worth rewatching several times.",6,1,2,10 December 2016
The Martian," Yes but ...
","Maybe it's the 'too high expectations' syndrome but as the end credits rolled, all I could think of what I disliked about the Martian. In no particular order & without spoilers: <ul><li>strange pacing. You spend huge parts of the movie on relatively short episodes and then suddenly skip 7 months on the space station, 1 month in the rover etc. It gives you a little bit of 'huh?!' feeling</li></ul><ul><li>the end was ludicrous. just impossible - i will believe Aliens exist before I believe that all these coincidences and risky situations can be successful in a row and in these conditions.</li></ul><ul><li>the movie is less visually stunning than Gravity. Or Interstellar for that matter.</li></ul>Now what was good!<ul><li>The cast, the cast, the cast. Of course Matt Damon. But also Pena and Kirsten Wiig in particular were good and underrated in the performance</li></ul><ul><li>The basic premise of the movie is fascinating. The whole 'sciencing the sh*t out of this' was wonderful and very original. </li></ul><ul><li>Cool characters and good evolution throughout time for the main protagonist.</li></ul>Overall a good movie, not my movie of the year though.",7,3,6,25 October 2015
