Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Poor
","I was once a Star Wars fan.I am one no longer.For me, Episode I (and II and III when you come to mention it) do not exist.Some would say, perhaps, that my view is clouded by my having been a great admirer of films IV, V and VI. This maybe so, but I know a good film when I see one, and 'Episode I: The Phantom Menace' is not a good film. (I will not underline the reasons for this belief because I don't have 24hours, and besides, all that can be found wrong with this film can be found in most of the lower star ratings... I concur with them all) It's not a good film and it is most certainly not a good prequel and it is a shame that George Lucas has had to sell out like this.Watch IV, V and VI (preferably before the 'touch-ups') and dream of what those prequels could have been... Your imagination will beat anything Mr Lucas could have come up with and for a lot less money...",1,0,4,10 August 2007
