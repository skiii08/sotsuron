Black Swan," great movie, beautiful, and thought provoking
","I watched this with my girlfriend on her recommendation. I walked out of the theatre crying on account of the most beautiful movie I had seen this year. when I got home, I quickly updated my top 100 favorite movies list, making this film #6, outdone only by watchmen, Scott pilgrim, Dracula (1992), true grit(2010), And jaws. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a lesbian, hallucinating, ballerina who lives with her bitch of a mom. :^Â• However, i do not recommend this to anyone under 18, due 2 GRAPHIC SEX, and disturbing images. Just be because it's # 6 on my favorite movies, doesn't mean I wasn't bothered by the mix of beauty and horror that was so delicately brought together by acclaimed director David argoninski",10,1,3,28 February 2011
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Beautiful and the only one of it's kind.
","this movie was a faithful adaption to the bram stoker classic. If he were still alive, he would be thrilled. The movie in itself is a passionate love story, balanced with a sense of evil and seduction. It's not overally bloody or sexual. It was damn near perfect. The Only thing that I have to complain about is Keanu reeves. He kind of took away from the beauty by adding his horrible acting. He is so robotic. other than that, the movie is flawless. this movie is the closest adaption to the classic novel. The characters are just right. Gary oldman as Dracula is the actor I've been waiting for. I know that the character is evil but despite the fact, towards the end of the film; you practically end up in love with the his character. god forgive me for that.",8,1,3,21 April 2011
