Scarface," To this day, I still don't get the praises for this abortion of a movie.
","It is fair to say that I despise 'Scarface' with a passion. What is even more interesting is that I did pay money to see the film when it was first in movie theaters. I found it to be a very hammy exercise in excess. Al Pacino was not only chewing (cursing, shooting, murdering, etc...) the scenery but it seemed like all of the actors were on the same terrible plane. There was no such thing as perspective in this movie which makes me appreciate other films within the genre like 'The Godfather' movies, 'GoodFellas' and in, arguably, Pacino's best performance, 'Donnie Brasco'.I don't think director Brian DePalma knew when to put on the brakes in some scenes and it made 'Scarface' all the more worse while watching it.Sometimes some movies should not have been given the green light and I believe 'Scarface' is one of them.",2,14,26,3 March 2002
Training Day," Some flaws but, overall, a very intense crime drama.
","I've always had a favorable bias toward Denzel Washington.When I first saw him playing the son of George Segal in the horrible comedy 'Carbon Copy' many years ago, I thought he was the brightest spot in the film. I've been impressed with his work for many years. Arguably, with some exceptions, his presence in a bad movie, can raise the rating of a movie a few notches. I don't believe 'Training Day' was a great crime drama. There were some glaring plot contrivances and a number of underwritten supporting characters made me wonder if David Ayer's screenplay wasn't thought out in its entirety. Despite those flaws, there was a lot to admire in the movie: Denzel's outstanding, charismatic performance as the rogue L.A. detective, Ethan Hawke's fine supporting role as the young protégé caught in a very dangerous corruption web and Antoine Fuqua's stylish direction of the most important characters: the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Did Denzel Washington deserve the Oscar for this performance? I still say no. I preferred his performances in 'Malcolm X' and 'The Hurricane'. (Of course, Al Pacino deserved it for 'The Godfather Part II' and/or 'Serpico' and not 'Scent of a Woman' and Russell Crowe deserved it for 'The Insider' and/or 'A Beautiful Mind' and not 'Gladiator' and, personally, I thought Tom Wilkinson gave the best performance this past year for 'In The Bedroom'. But the decisions have been made, they won't be changed in the record books and there will always be disputes on who should win an award for which film. Digression is over. Goodbye!)",8,1,11,18 April 2002
Brokeback Mountain," Taking two lives in context
","Describing 'Brokeback Mountain' as 'that gay cowboy movie' is simplistic and condescending. When talking about male/male and male/female relationships, this has much more depth than a lot of other movies. I think director Ang Lee and screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana knew that they had a great project in adapting author Annie Proulx's short story to the big screen.Sometimes you can tell if actors are not totally invested in their roles especially if the script is weak. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal convinced me that they were Ennis and Jack. Both actors give their best performances to date.A good film can be an even great film if you have a strong supporting cast and 'Brokeback' is no exception. They include Randy Quaid as the ranch owner who first hired Ennis and Jack, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway as the wives of Ennis and Jack respectively, Linda Cardellini as the waitress Ennis meets after his divorce and Kate Mara as Ennis' eldest daughter. Also, Roberta Maxwell's brief scenes as Jack's mother were very memorable. (On a side note, the last short story that I thought was adapted brilliantly to the big screen was Stephen King's 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' which became 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Is it a coincidence that Thomas Newman's music from 'Shawshank' is being used for the TV ads and the trailers for 'Brokeback'?) It may take more than just one viewing to see if a film holds up to close scrutiny. With 'Brokeback' receiving so much buzz and controversy, that scrutiny will continue. It's been about a few days since watching 'Brokeback' and I'm convinced that it should be called an instant classic.",10,7,9,7 January 2006
Crash," You do know what happens when you assume?
","It's been only a few hours after watching an early Friday afternoon showing of 'Crash' and I'm certain that I will be seeing this movie again. This movie sticks with me.With writing collaborator Bobby Moresco, co-writer/director Paul Haggis has managed to create a tight, challenging, and very fascinating view of race and bigotry and how people (in this case several residents of Los Angeles) are unable to or unwilling to view people as equals. The dialog is very raw and politically incorrect. When the characters are first introduced, it sounds like many of their censored buttons were turned off. Insult first, regret later.This format has been done before with varying results. (In my opinion, Robert Altman's 'Nashville' is one of the best films with numerous characters. As of this posting, I have not seen 'Short Cuts'. I thought Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Magnolia' was a mixed bag.) I'm interested in how Moresco and Haggis were able to create such complex characters when many of them are on screen for about 15-20 minutes or less? The entire cast gives performances that are worthy of several acting awards. From actors who have been reliable in a number of movies (Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton), to actors who gave their best performances in their careers (Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Terrence Howard). From the actors who make their mark in only a few scenes (Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza, Bruce Kirby, Beverly Todd, Keith David) to even someone I'd never expected to be than good (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges). I'll be disappointed if no one from the cast receives an Oscar nomination.As much as I was impressed by all of the story arcs, what touched me the most was the relationship between the locksmith and his daughter, beautifully played by Michael Pena and Ashlyn Sanchez. The conflict that threatens their lives provides a twist that was life-affirming.Just like life, 'Crash' is alternately dramatic and comedic that resonated with me and I'm certain this movie will be talked about for many years. Congrats to everyone involved with the movie.Update (July 17, 2005):On watching 'Crash' for the second time, I was still impressed with the pacing of the movie. I picked up several clues that I did not pick up on in first viewing the movie: the confrontation between the detective (Jennifer Esposito) and the other car crash victim at the beginning of the movie; in the gun shop, Dorri's (Bahar Soomekh) telling glance of the boxes of bullets on the shelf; Sgt. Ryan's (Matt Dillon) confrontation with the HMO employee (Loretta Devine) and her decision to let him speak after security comes into her office; the assistant (Nona Gaye) glancing at the DA (Brendan Fraser) while he was talking to his wife (Sandra Bullock) on the cell phone. With all of the scenes that were in-your-face, it was interesting to see the some of the scenes that might have seem insignificant but said a lot about the characters and their situations. I'm not surprised at the praise by most published critics. I'm pleasantly surprised that audiences have responded toward the movie. As of this update, 'Crash' has earned over $50 Million and is ranked 95 on the IMDb's top 250 films. In perspective, 'Crash' was released in the U.S. the same weekend that 'Kingdom of Heaven' and 'House of Wax'. Even with its serious subject matter, 'Crash' grossed more than both of its weekend movie competitors.I'm also not surprised at the positive and negative criticism of the film. On reading the reviews and the message boards on IMDb and reading reviews on other web sites, I noticed a number of people are expressing their feelings of a film on the web for the first time. This is not a movie that demands you to feel neutral at the end. Sure, the film is manipulative to shake viewers up. To some who think manipulation in movies is a negative, please explain why horror films are a hit?Some people believed that there were too many coincidences and that was one major reason why some people were not impressed. I believe the coincidences were there for a reason. Some situations do occur for a reason. Should there be an explanation on why things happen? I'm still impressed with the movie and I'm looking forward to buying the DVD.",9,3,12,7 May 2005
The Best Years of Our Lives," Over 60 years old and still a classic!
","In 2004, I wrote the following statements on an IMDb message board when a user wondered if The Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie: ***** To me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule. I think in many ways 'The Best Years of Our Lives' is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid-1940s after WWII. I believe 'Coming Home' and 'The Deer Hunter', both released in 1978, were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in 'The Best Years of Our Lives'.What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 1980-81 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.This movie still packs a wallop and I'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. *****I'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Also, though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic, It's a Wonderful Life, arguably, The Best Years of Our Lives' Oscar wins, including Best Picture, were very well-deserved. I've just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years, The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful, beautifully acted and well-crafted motion picture.",10,164,182,22 February 2005
Top Secret!," It's Silly! It's Stupid! It's Funny!
","The movie team of David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker chose to film 'Top Secret!' instead of making a sequel to their previous hit 'Airplane!'. In my opinion, they made the right choice.Although 'Top Secret!' wasn't a hit at the box office, it's developed into a cult classic. This didn't look like it was an easy comedy to make. ZAZ were working without a net. Especially trying to combine two dissimilar genres (the WWII spy thriller & the silly, Elvis-like musical) into one funny comedy. Some of the one-liners, the pratfalls, the skits don't always work. But I've had so much fun watching the movie that I don't really care.If I'm feeling low, 'Top Secret!' is one comedy I usually rent. It's dumb fun.",7,1,2,8 December 2004
American History X," A good movie with one great performance.
","Racism is a hot-button issue that many people wish would go away. It's like the proverbial pink elephant in a small room: no one wants to acknowledge it, but it's there.There's no denying that American History X is a well-intentioned drama and at its center is the exciting and charismatic performance by Edward Norton. It could have been a great movie but there were one major flaw that made the movie just a better-than-average movie.My main issue with the film involves Norton's younger brother. It did not help that Edward Furlong gave a very poor performance. Perhaps because he was not on the same acting level as Norton, Furlong was unconvincing. Sadly, I really did not care about the fate of Furlong's character. If there was a better actor in that role, it might have changed my feelings about the movie.I certainly understand why American History X has an effect on many moviegoers. It is very professional piece of work and it does tackle the paradoxical nature of race. It could have been a great movie on the same level as Do The Right Thing. American History X is a good movie with one standout performance.",7,0,1,15 February 2006
Moulin Rouge!," Style over substance = a creative mess
","I was about to give up on Moulin Rouge just over the halfway mark when the 'El Tango de Roxanne Medley' appeared. I will never listen to Sting's 'Roxanne' the same way again. (A big thanks to actor Jacek Koman as the 'Unconscious Argentinian' for performing the song.) It was one of the few times I tried to give a movie one more chance to prove itself. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang pleasantly and were certainly up for the challenge director Baz Luhrmann was giving them. Overall, Moulin Rouge is a stylish, ambitious and gleefully over-the-top musical romance that is very heavy on the senses and is, fatally, very light on plot. As mentioned before, portions of the movie are better than the entire film.",6,0,1,6 January 2002
Slap Shot," ...and a hockey game broke out.
","This was the first time in a number of years I checked out 'Slap Shot'. I remember the movie being very profane, dirty and extremely funny. It still is a funny film after all these years though I did notice a number of things in the movie that made it even more than just a funny sports movie.Nancy Dowd's very observant screenplay and George Roy Hill's sharp direction showed the trials and tribulations of being a minor league hockey player: the long road trips, the drinking & partying, the competition against other teams that are going through the same lifestyle.(Arguably, writer/director Ron Shelton did a slightly better job dealing with the same plot in a different minor league sports movie several years later: 'Bull Durham'.)The characters and the subplots still have me laughing out loud: Dunlop putting a bounty on a competing player's head, the rug-wearing radio announcer (wonderfully played by Andrew Duncan), the French Canadian goaltender (Yvon Barrette) who makes Yogi Berra's malaprop statements sound grammatically correct, the underhanded general manager (the late, great Strother Martin), the unexpected striptease by the Chiefs leading scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) which catches many players, who were beating each other on the ice, totally off guard. I love the line by Ogle Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd, Nancy's brother) after beating up a Chief player and then seeing Braden taking his uniform off: 'This is disgusting....' How about that for irony!I do have to admit that what still has me laughing but not as much as before was the overall homophobic atmosphere in the movie. To insult another player (or, most notably, the Chiefs absentee owner) is to call someone a derogatory name. Despite mentioning this observation, I still laughed out loud when Dunlop taunted a competing team's goaltender, among other names, a lesbian. As a hockey fan since the 1970s. I believe screenwriter Nancy Dowd was very accurate in depicting what goes on inside and outside the locker room. At the same time, when it comes to trash talking, and the possibility that the person on player may trash, might be gay (e.g. a character in 'Les Boys'. For the record, I was not too impressed with the movie.), I wonder if 'Slap Shot' is more dated that I first thought (bad fashion notwithstanding).The relationship between Reggie Dunlop and his still married but separated wife still sticks out to me as very bittersweet. Jennifer Warren's performance stood out for me when I first saw the movie and it's one of the many strong aspects of the movie. I got the feeling that as much as she loves Reggie, she was not a happy woman in the relationship.Paul Newman gave some great performances before (Hud, Cool Hand Luke, The Hustler) and after (The Verdict, Nobody's Fool, arguably, The Color of Money & Absence of Malice) 'Slap Shot'. I certainly don't think it's his best work but I though he did a good job of what it was like to be an 'old man' in a young man's sport.Note: For legal reasons, a number of songs that appeared in the movie on the big screen and on cable TV do not appear on the U.S. home video version. They include 'Get Right Back Where We Started From' by Maxine Nightingale, Elton John's 'Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word', Leo Sayer's 'You Make Me Feel Like Dancing', Fleetwood Mac's 'Rhiannon' and a song called 'A Little Bit South of Saskatoon'.",8,1,3,8 May 2001
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A taut, well-crafted look at television in the 1950's.
","It is fair to say that I might be at a bit of an advantage to some viewers who've watched 'Good Night, and Good Luck' because I worked in the broadcast medium for nearly two decades. I've read a lot about Edward R. Murrow, Sen. Joseph McCarthy, and the history of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). I wonder if the reactions for George Clooney's near-masterpiece 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' depends on the viewer's interest and knowledge about television and politics in the 1950's. The numerous choices made by Clooney and co-screenwriter Grant Heslov, to focus primarily on Murrow (brilliantly played by veteran character actor David Strathairn) and his significance in the early days of television and broadcast journalism, made for a very compelling tale. It was very interesting to actually listen to Murrow's words on the big screen. The speech that bookmarks the movie is an actual transcript. The concerns by Murrow is similar to former FCC commissioner Newton Minnow's about television being a 'vast wasteland.' The decision to film the movie in black and white captured an almost film noir quality. It also made a lot of sense considering that many TV shows were shown in homes with black and white television. What could have easily been a fatal mistake and used as a crutch to tell the story, it was a great idea to use real footage of Sen. McCarthy, which I believe speaks for itself. Using an actor would have been a mistake.Within this great acting ensemble, I was impressed with Frank Langella's role as CBS chairman William S. Paley. Again, it easily could have been played as the stereotypically cold and heartless executive. But Langella interprets Paley as an ambitious but fair individual who wants to do the right thing and allows Murrow and his co-workers to report the news without interference. In this day and age of all news channels and talking heads shows, can anyone do that now? While watching the movie in the theater, a moviegoer behind me said, 'My God! They smoked a lot in the 50's.' It certainly was the socially correct thing to do especially since many tobacco companies used to advertise on television. Using a tobacco ad as a transition, in addition to Dianne Reeves' musical interludes, was sheer genius.The only issue I had with the film was the underwritten plot device with the married employees. Luckily for Clooney and Heslov, the performances by Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson made their story more interesting that it ever was.I believe 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' should be included with 'Network' and 'Broadcast News' as one of the best films about television.",9,1,2,15 February 2006
The Mission," Politics and religion are like oil and water; they should never mix.
","It is always very interesting how people react to movies and I was very surprised at my reaction to 'The Mission'. After the movie ended, I was more angry and exasperated than moved. I had no problems with the production. The breathtaking opening scenes alone had me hooked. It was beautifully filmed by director Roland Joffé and Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges. Two years earlier, they worked on the very moving drama 'The Killing Fields'.I've listened to sections of Ennio Morricone's musical score performed live by various choral groups and had a chance to listen to his full score on CD a few months ago. It is probably one of Morricone's best works. Even after 19 years, I'm still very shocked that he did not win an Oscar for that work. (This not to say that Herbie Hancock, the eventual winner for ''Round Midnight' did not deserve the award. Usually the Academy chooses traditional, epic-size scores like Morricone's. Go figure.) My major problem with the film was Robert Bolt's script. To me, the story should have been about the South American Indian chief and his tribe and not about the Jesuit priests (which included Jeremy Irons and, in one of his earliest roles, Liam Neeson) trying to convert them to Christianity.I also had a major problem with the character played by Robert De Niro. Was this character added to the story as an afterthought? I don't believe the character of the slave trader/mercenary/monk was necessary. It was more of a plot contrivance. It also did not help that De Niro was poorly miscast. Ironically, Spainard Antonio Banderas might have been a better choice. (I would have said Javier Bardem but he was 17 years old when the movie was released.)The late Ray McAnally easily gave the best performance as Cardinal Altamirano. Despite being enamored of the work of the Jesuits and having many natives becoming Christian, his decisions would eventually set in motion the fate of everyone. Is Altamirano an evil man? Did he do God's will? Were the decisions made to exert the power of the church? The character was very complex and McAnally should have gotten a Supporting Oscar nomination for his outstanding performance.There's a lot to admire but, overall, 'The Mission' was a bit of a disappointment. It should have been better.",6,4,13,25 April 2005
Ray," Electrifying performances by Foxx and company
","It's been a few since buying 'Ray' on DVD and I'm happy that I had a chance to see the movie before Jamie Foxx's Oscar win. He gave an electrifying performance and he deserved all the accolades he received.I don't believe any other actor would have done a better job than Foxx. Without naming names, I believe some actors would have gotten Ray Charles' mannerisms but not able to go any deeper than that. Prior to Jamie Foxx's performance, when it comes to musical biographies, I still believe Gary Busey's performance as Buddy Holly and Sissy Spacek's performance as Loretta Lynn are two of the best acting and musical performances in the past few decades. (Although Foxx lip-synced many of Ray Charles' musical performances, Foxx did receive credit for performing 5 songs.) Even with the film's obvious flaws (e.g.: In my opinion, movies will never be able to capture a person's or a subject's entire history), Foxx made me believe he was young Ray Charles Robinson.The actors surrounding Foxx also gave some fine performances including Kerry Washington as one of Ray's wives, Regina King as one of Ray's mistresses, and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother.I'm glad director Taylor Hackford and writer James L. White made the attempt, with overall success, to capture who Ray Charles was, flaws and all.",8,1,2,16 April 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," The film has lingered with me for a long time....
","Great lead performances by Robbins and Freeman. An outstanding supporting cast, fine cinematography by Roger Deakins, well-chosen shots by editor Richard Francis-Bruce, a haunting musical score by Thomas Newman, and a well-realized adaptation of the short story by Stephen King as adapted and directed by Frank Darabont.  
What still amazes me about the overall positive response to 'Shawshank' on the IMDb is how it touched viewers years after it was released into theaters. I saw the movie in the theaters after it received a few weeks after the Oscar nominations were announced. I was blown away by the movie then and it still gets to me now.",10,0,0,22 June 2001
The Queen," Anchored by Helen Mirren, 'The Queen' is a brilliant recreation of royalty under a public microscope
","I have no idea if what screenwriter Peter Morgan and director Stephen Frears presented in the fascinating, alternately dramatic and biting film 'The Queen' is even close to what the Windsors are like in real life. More often than not, I view Queen Elizabeth II in press and video not knowing a thing about her. The movie could have easily been a skit making fun of the royal family, i.e.: Spitting Image, The Kids in the Hall, etc. But Morgan and Frears took the high road but not without some very darkly funny lines and observations set during the week when Princess Diana was killed in a car crash and the royal family's reaction the week after the news.Helen Mirren's complex and believable portrayal of a Queen and a royal family in crisis was outstanding. What really impressed me is how underplayed the performance was. It certainly would have been out of character for Queen Elizabeth II to chew the scenery. Mirren's work, which justifiably received many acting awards, is a great current example of an under-the-surface performance. Just like the Queen herself, keep a stiff upper lip and don't allow your emotions to show in public. Somehow, Mirren made Queen Elizabeth II human which was not an easy task. Despite anyone's negative feelings for the film itself (excluding myself), Mirren's performance should be studied by acting fans for years.I was also fascinated by the relationship dynamics throughout the movie. From the Queen's back-and-forth meetings with the young, new Prime Minister Tony Blair (well-played by Michael Sheen) to her husband Prince Philip (James Cromwell), her mother (Sylvia Syms) and even the relationship she has with the public.At a running time of just under 1 hour and 40 minutes, 'The Queen' ponders several questions: After the death of Diana, despite protocol issues, were the actions of the Windsors justified? Was the general public justified in criticizing the actions of the Windsors? As a world, do we expect too much from people in higher profiles? With the press and the internet, do we have the right to know the private life of a public figure? Frears, Morgan, Mirren and the rest of the production crew for 'The Queen' did a masterful job of capturing one of the world's most private public figures.",9,1,1,7 April 2007
Gladiator," An ambitious failure
","While watching 'Gladiator', I was reminded of a number of films with either a similar setting ('Ben Hur', 'El Cid') or a similar storyline (avenge your family's murder like 'The Outlaw Josey Wales', or gather a large group of people to fight against a oppressive leadership like 'Braveheart').Despite the film's budget and some of director Ridley Scott's impressive visuals, 'Gladiator' left me cold. The movie didn't blow me away. Throughout the movie, I was reminded of films that did a better job. 'Gladiator' felt very drab and, in some stretches, dull.I've been impressed with Russell Crowe's work in a number of movies including 'Romper Stomper', 'L.A. Confidential' and especially, 'The Insider'. I was not impressed with his work in this movie. I thought that he captured the physical aspects but not the emotional. I was surprised how much I didn't care about his character.I thought Joaquin Phoenix did a better job as Commodus. His callous, cold-blooded actions were right on target. I did find it interesting that Derek Jacobi, who played Gracchus, played a similar character in the title role of 'I, Claudius' several decades ago.Considering all the battles that occurred in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Oliver Reed gave his most understated performance in the final movie of his career.As always, with any Ridley Scott film, the visuals will always be impressive. But unless the script he directs from is really good (e.g., 'Thelma and Louise'), the end product will always be a good-looking but underwhelming movie.",5,0,0,7 March 2001
