National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Thrilling Winter Ride
","My wife and I were able to attend a sneak preview offered by Disney at our local AMC Theater. The theater was packed thanks to the local radio station giveaway of passes. I enjoyed the first movie but it wasn't on my Top 100 movie list for great films. It was what it was, a fun, ahistorical excuse to put Nicholas Cage in the middle of an Indiana Jones-esquire adventure. It entertained but had the substance of cotton candy, as once I was out of the theater the movie left my memory. So I went into this screening of Book of Secrets with middling expectations. I will have to admit the writers did a good job of constructing a cool story to serve as the catalyst to send Nick 'Ben Gates' Cage and his posse on an adventure worth the space in my memory.I am sure the story has been summarized well already. So I am cutting to the chase (or chases) in what I found appealing in this film. Ed Harris as the bad guy worked as I found Ed's character to be sufficiently creepy as the pseudo-Blackwater chief 'Mitch Wilkinson.' He could have been the cookie-cutter foil but the writers added a nice twist at the end of the story that redeems Wilkinson and raises his character above the stock movie nemesis. Helen Mirren was a delight as Ben's Mom who happened to be an expert in dead languages. Mirren and Voight had good chemistry as a long-separated couple who could have benefited from marriage counseling all those years ago.Yet what I enjoyed the most was the interplay within the triad, Ben Gates, his ersatz ex Abigail Chase and the everyman hero, Riley Poole. They played off each other as if they had known each other for years. Cage as Gates, pulls off the insufferable but lovable ex so well that you buy into the plot line that has the lovely and sharp Diane Kruger, as Abigail Chase, fall in love with Gates all over again. This could slide into treacle without the valuable contribution of Justin Bartha as the long-suffering, unacknowledged action hero, Riley Poole. His humor was always timely and never forced. It was also gratifying to see that he did get the girl and the car in the end.Am I the only one who thought that Bruce Greenwood brought a Kennedyesque air about his portrayal of 'The President.' Maybe it was due to his excellent work as JFK in 'Thirteen Days,' but he actually convinced me we could have a President who was intelligent and well-spoken. Also, he has me curious as to what was in the Presidents' book and how that will be played out in 'National Treasure III: Page 47.' So I hope they invite him back to join Gates in the next installment.So if you loved the first movie, you won't be disappointed in the Book of Secrets. It is a better, more coherent film that the first one with a great cast that worked well together. What more could you ask for in an adventure film released in December rather than summer!",8,9,17,21 December 2007
Star Trek," Star Trek is Back and Better than Ever
","I have been a Star Trek fan since I caught the Original Series in reruns back in the early 70's. I am a huge fan of TOS and I was a bit concerned that JJ ABrams would turn this franchise into a 90120 in outer space and abandon the core values of Trek left to us by the Creator, Gene Roddenberry. After seeing the movie last night at our IMAX theater, my worries evaporated and morphed into uncontainable excitement and wonder. This new Trek was a mind-blowing experience, the stunning visuals and special effects, Abrams was able to communicate the spectacular feeling of being in space and truly showing how magnificent the USS Enterprise is in her element.The actors were amazing and brought each of the icons they were playing to life. Chris Pine oozed cockiness and leadership, Zachacy Quinto made you feel Spock's inner turmoil and conflicted emotions and Karl Urban WAS 'Bones' McCoy. The rest of the cast was, pardon the pun, stellar. Zoe Saldana brought a great charm and intelligence to Uhura, John Cho exhibited his swordsmanship and humor and the oh so young Alton Yelchin played Chckov's accent up in a believable manner yet got to show off his mad science skills. Special kudos to Bruce Greenwood for bringing Captain Christopher Pike to life and being a mentor to the rebellious young Kirk.This is the best Star Trek since The Wrath of Khan. It has the depth of emotion we expect from Star Trek while still telling an amazing space opera story that takes you into the depths of outer space as well as the depths of human & Vulcan emotion. Eric Bana's Nero is the weakest element of the story. With a running time just over two hours, they just couldn't fit more of his back story in which leaves his character a bit unfinished in the movie. The writers of the film did do a prequel graphic novel that explains how the events of this movie were triggered and fills out the Nero back-story. If you love this film and want to know more, I highly recommend the Star Trek: Countdown graphic novel. Otherwise, this movie blew all of my expectations out of the water and more than thrilled me with the confidence that JJ Abrams and company know exactly how to make a Star Trek epic. This franchise will boldly go and live long and prosper with this cast and crew. A must see movie for Trekker and newcomer alike.",10,4,16,8 May 2009
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Why do critics hate Ice Age so much?
","There are many critics' reviews I have read about Ice Age: The meltdown that were highly critical and dismissive of this movie. As an adult (38) who saw this film on its opening weekend, all I can say in response is hogwash. This was a highly enjoyable story with likable characters in a visually stimulating animated film.Obviously Mannie Mammoth gets more focus in this film with the usual ongoing comic commentary provided by his sidekick Sid the Sloth. The real victim in this sequel is any important story points or action for Diego except for his one major fear. I did find that part of the story lacking but this lull was easily made up for by the rest of the plot. I plan to go see this movie again at the theater and then I'll add the DVD release to my collection to be a companion to the first Ice Age DVD set. This is a great film for children of all ages (8-80).Knowing how well Scrat was received by fans of the first Ice Age, Scrat gets even more acorn action in this sequel. I began to feel bad for the poor Saber-tooth Squirrel but you have to admit he is a shining example of perseverance. His voyage to the great beyond for his eternal reward and resulting interference by Sid was absolutely fantastic and hysterically funny. I went out today and bought my Scrat 'Goin Nutz Scrat' Interactive Electronic toy. He now has an honored place in my bedroom next to my model of the Starship Enterprise. Who knows when Scrat may want to join Starfleet to find the Planet of Eternal Nuts in the Acorn Nebulae.",10,2,4,2 April 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Time is the measure of all things
","The story starts off slowly but poignantly in a 'retirement' home in New Orleans. The people that populate Benjamin's world are all at the end of their mortal existence while Benjamin is headed in the other directions. Also, one learns that there are many places one may be struck by lightening.The special effects & makeup that altered Brad Pitt's appearance as he de-aged during the film were amazing. I found myself getting lost in the story despite the amazing lack of car chases, explosions and cheap sexual titillation. A very mature presentation on how time changes us all and how the choices we make or ignore have lasting impact upon us until the day we die.The acting was sublime and superb by all concerned. Cate Blanchett did an amazing job of handling the demands of showing the complicated emotions and conflicts felt by Daisy as she deals with the truth of her relationship with Benjamin. Kudos also to Taraji P. Henson's soulful depiction of Benjamin's 'mother,' Queenie.Being a resident of New Orleans, the most poignant part of the film was the ending. I found the death of Daisy coinciding with the arrival of Hurricane Katrina and the flooding of the warehouse holding Monsieur Gateau's 'The Reverse Time Clock' hit me literally where I live. The movie made liberal use of showing off New Orleans but that ending was emotional as Katrina still haunts us to this day. Also, I learned I would never want to stay in Murmansk in winter.This is a must-see movie for those who love movies rather than soulless SFX spectacles. Brad Pitt & this film better get some Oscar love or a whole lot of folks will be upset.",10,1,4,12 January 2009
Downfall," Excellent look at the final days of Hitler
","A very chilling and profoundly disturbing movie. This is a good outcome as I am sure that was the intent of the people who put this movie together. Sublime acting by the whole cast made it feel like you were in the bunker with Hitler for those last days. Some may need Prozac after watching this film as it does not have the typical Hollywood happy ending. Excellent history as the script attempts to stay close to the actual historical record as possible. Even though I am a historian of WWII, I still found things out in this movie that were new to me. Still, what sets this movie apart from other 'war flicks' is the intense work by the actors to bring these characters to life and make them as multi-dimensional as their real-life counterparts must have been. These are not your cookie-cutter Nazis as seen in most war films. You still loathe and despise these people but you come to understand them a bit better. Hitler does not come off well as they portray his loss of touch with reality quite well. This was a man who almost conquered the world yet we see him beaten and broken and feeling betrayed by his loyal followers as well as the entire German people. You get to see some of the cost to the civilians of Berlin for Hitler's desire to see them pay for their failure to win the war. This movie does not glorify Hitler or the Third Reich rather it attempts to put those final days into a bit of perspective. A very tragic and horrific story but one that most Americans would benefit from seeing.",10,1,3,26 March 2005
Hancock," Will Smith Delivers another Summertime Movie Treat
","I caught a preview showing of Hancock tonight. I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun, mostly fast-paced popcorn flick. The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the 'cute' button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the 'Summer Blockbuster' and those who enjoy Will Smith.",8,159,289,30 June 2008
Prometheus," Fascinating exploration of Human Desire
","This is the one movie this summer that you need to go into without knowing anything that is to come. I thought the story did an excellent job in exploring the human need to connect with something greater... for some it is 'god, for some it is eternal physical life, for some it is material and financial profit, for some it is the desire to know what is out there and for some... well, they were programmed to be the way they are. Human desire drives this film and it can take humanity to some very dark places before it is over. Prometheus is a cautionary tale about being careful in getting what you most desire. For fans of Alien & Aliens (like me) Ridley Scott provides the foundation of what is to occur in those films. The revelations were delicious treats for such fans and I know we appreciate them greatly. The writers of this story realized that a lot of the viewing audience would not know the Alien mythology so they wrote the story in such a manner that you can come in not knowing anything about the Alien franchise and being just fine. Actually, it would be even better to know nothing and see Prometheus and then watch Alien & Aliens to go in chronological order. I am really looking forward to the sequel to Prometheus because I get the feeling that payback will be a bitch. This is not a film for the young because it gets quite intense & it explores deeply philosophical issues that lead humans to some very dark places. Teens & adults will appreciate the serious storytelling while admiring the fantastic cinematography which is best appreciated in Real 3D. The cast is brilliant, the relationships intense and the discovery of the creators may not be as pleasing to the religiously faithful versus what they find in their holy books. - Now the part that contains spoilers. - I see where some have had a field day in picking the plot to pieces with criticism on how it wasn't scientific enough for them. I agree that the writers clearly had these humans do some stupid things if this were a purely scientific expedition to look for new life. NASA would do it much differently than the crew of the Prometheus. Instead to drive the story about humans on a search for their desires, some material and some spiritual, you have to suspend your connection to the rational world because this is mythological storytelling. You even get a miraculous birth thrown in but it ends a bit differently than the Jesus story. Dr. Shaw is looking for the Biblical Creator and she is the Ying of this adventure to the David/Weyland Yang of looking for the secret to eternal physical life. Weyland and his corporation have their own agenda which lives on in the evil found in Alien & Aliens. Now that everyone has had their hopes and desires crushed by what they found on LV-223 it will be interesting to see what Dr. Shaw and the newly liberated David find on the Engineers' homeworld when they find it & bring a dish of revenge which is best served cold... and it gets very cold in space. So go see this movie without dissecting every little thing that happens and just enjoy the philosophical exploration of the human condition.",8,3,8,10 June 2012
