The Avengers," average
","Blockbuster actions scenes and CGI, but held back by a video game script. Accurate to the comic books or not, the premise was insufficient for a project with such potential, but on the bright side, this is what playing video games on playstation 10 will look like most likely, and probably with a story line as equal to the one from Avengers, hopefully better though. The movies of the individual heroes were far and away better than the avengers. It just wasn't put together well. Keep making Iron Man's and Incredible hulks, preferably with Edward Norton, and scrap Thor and Captain America. Their boring and too fictitious in comparison to the others. At least Iron Man and Hulk are based in Science. Thor is fantasy, magical realm, children's level type stuff, and Captain America is flat out boring.",7,4,15,12 May 2012
