The Blair Witch Project," Superb realization of a bad nightmare
","Certainly scared the pants off me. There are no monsters or axe wielding psychos that you know you should watch out for to creep  up on the characters here. And that is what makes it so so uncomfortable.This thing is like Road Rules meets Stephen King. If you've ever had a really vivid nighmare that made you feel upset even after you woke up, you'll recognize the familiar senses of confusion, catharsis and the descent into despair that this flick rams down your throat.Totally original and extremely uncomfortable.",9,0,0,27 November 1999
Erin Brockovich," Actually pretty dull movie
","Don't be deceived. I really don't believe there is all that much to like about this flick. If you empathize with in-your-face abrasive characters with mega chips on their shoulders, then Julia Roberts' character is going to come over as 'ballsy' and 'brassy' to you.If you find that kind of attitude just too 80's to be at all endearing anymore, then her character is just going to come over as plain rude, hostile and largely detached from anyone else's feelings except other people who've had a hard hard time.Whilst the story may be true, it was profoundly dull, played out with little sense of suspense or tension building, and quite frankly is better suited to a 1 hour documentary than a 2 and a half hour snore of a cinematic effort.",Null,1,2,7 April 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Lives up to it's name: Both Hollow & Sleepy
","I really tried to like this one.I went in with no expectations. I ignored Johnny Depp's incredibly bad accent, his profoundly trite and exaggerated mannerisms and his hammy one liners. I dismissed the disjointed plotline and superficial characterization.About half an hour into this movie I heard the dulcet tones of someone snoring in one of the rows behind me. I thought to myself, how rude! At that point I was still under the impression that this movie had some hidden substance it was about to unleash on the audience.Tim, you're a bad bad lad. How could you rob me of my $7? I'm very sure Tim Burton fans will like this, but this movie will seriously make me reconsider ever paying to see a Tim Burton work again.The only thing which saved the movie a little maybe was Christopher Walken as the deranged face and Ray Park (Darth Maul) as the deranged stunt body of the villain. Even then Burton managed to film the action sequences with such little originality and such a heavy hand on the 'dark is cooool maaan!' lever on his camera that the action was forgettable at best.So what do we have? Forgettable action padding miserable plot, all wrapped up in misty 'dark is coool maan' shades.Horrible.",2,6,11,20 November 1999
Pitch Black," Deep Blue Sea Meets Lost in Space
","To cut a long story short, this is an OK rental flick, not, in my opinion worth seeing at the movies.Seriously if you loved deep blue sea, you'll probably go for this one too. Whilst some of the direction and plot had originality to it, and the characters were mostly watchable (Vin Diesel notably), I was disappointed that the story which starts out so promisingly in terms of its sense of danger and eerieeness, decays so easily into yer average monster shoot-em-up flick.SEMI-SPOLIERS - It would have been great if the monsters were much more insiduous, intelligent and scheming as a collective in their dealings with the poor trapped humans. That is most significantly why the Alien flicks are truly terrifying and this is just average.It would have been really entertaining if the pitch black of the title led to some greater unseen evil-from-within kinda of thing, but as it is once you've seen the monsters, that's all there is to it.5/10",6,0,0,5 March 2000
American Psycho," Edgy, black and fascinating.
","Christian Bale is fantastic. Totally whacked out man. His portrayal of a man so immersed in materialism that nothing moves him (including murders and executions) anymore is enthralling.The story is a little patchy in places, but overall, this is great flick. Highly recommended.",10,0,0,19 April 2000
The Sixth Sense," One for the collection
","You know, there is no way I would have imagined Bruce Willis could pull this kind of movie off. He's completely the wrong person for it when you think about it. Usually known for his smarmy, in control hard man action roles, it is totally explosive to see him playing a tortured, confused waif of a man, grasping at straws and completely out of his depth.But forget Willis, everyone in the movie is compelling for different reasons. The movie itslef is like a box. When you get to the end and see all sides come together, you simply have to marvel at the neatness and cohesiveness with which the whole experience was put together.Beautifully acted, scripted, photographed and delivered.10 out of 10.",10,0,0,27 November 1999
Gladiator," Superb sumptuous sweeping epic
","I think this might just be Ridley Scott's best yet. The story is good, not great, but it's just so well told and in such bold charismatic tones, that you can't help but admire it. Lots of political intrigue, a fair sprinkling of human dignity, much savagery and of course Scott's familiar brooding cinematography.Crowe has just got this swagger about him, that you would for kill for. All the actors are intoxicating to watch.Yeah, sure, it's a little cheesy and drawn out in places, but still easily the best movie of the year.Go see.",10,0,0,14 May 2000
