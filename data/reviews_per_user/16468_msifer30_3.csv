Vertigo," Left Hanging: Vertigo as Neo-Noir
","CAUTION: SPOILER AHEAD!!!The film noir Vertigo, (1958) directed by Alfred Hitchcock and adapted from the novel d'Entre les Morts (The Living and the Dead) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac uses a structure that leaves the audience hanging by creating loose ends in the plot and through ellipses in the story. The story follows Det. John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart) as he is hired by an old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to look into his wife's infatuation with a mysterious woman named Carlotta Valdez. Ferguson's acrophobia, or intense fear of heights, has caused him to retire as a detective and he now works as a freelance private detective. Without giving away the plot, it is hard to describe the structure of this film. Throughout there are plot twists which change the entire direction of the film which leave the past behind. The audience is left wondering what really happened.Even from the very beginning of the film, the audience is left hanging. It opens with Ferguson and a policeman chasing a fugitive across the rooftops of buildings in San Francisco. Ferguson falls, but hangs onto a flimsy water drain looking down six stories to the ground. The policeman with Ferguson attempts to save him, but falls to his death. It is not explained how Ferguson actually escapes his predicament, which seems unlikely. He could have pulled himself up, but the flimsy water drain would have snapped. Also, no one else was around to help him any time soon, so it becomes questionable if he could have been helped. In the next scene, Ferguson talks about wearing a corset with his friend Marjorie 'Midge' Wood (Barbra Bel Geddes). He is also using a cane. If Ferguson had fallen from the drain, he would be either dead, or have sustained a traumatic injury, so his injuries do not offer any clues as to what happened. From this point, the audience is first exposed to the element of the film which keeps them hanging, just like Ferguson on the drain.In addition to leaving the audience wondering, Vertigo utilizes its ellipsoidal structure to give an exposition to the story. The first scene of the film starts out with a past event that gives way to the present. Ferguson's incident on the rooftop gives way to a present day conversation with Wood, which allows the audience to understand why Wood is so concerned when Ferguson attempts to climb a chair. She knows that if he does his vertigo would set in for him. Through this ellipse in time, we learn of Ferguson's weakness. We see a past traumatic experience of Ferguson and then move onto the present time.The next part of the film consists of Ferguson conducting the investigation for his old friend Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Elster wants to find out why his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) is seemingly possessed by a mysterious dead woman named Carlotta Valdez. In her dreamlike state, she continuously attempts suicide, trying to rid the spirit of Valdez from her body. At one point, she falls in the San Francisco bay and Ferguson pulls her out. They begin to fall in love, but Elster's condition seems to get worse and worse. She actually thinks she is Valdez. Then, on a trip to the Mission San Juan Bautista, Elster falls from the tower. Ferguson is blamed for her death, as he was stricken with vertigo attempting to climb the stairs to save her.This is when the film becomes a uniquely structured film. In typical film noir and murder mysteries, there is a final conclusion which gives all the solutions to the mystery. But in Vertigo the twist occurs in the middle of the film, exposing Ferguson's friend Gavin Elster's plan to murder his wife. Ferguson soon finds out that the Madeleine Elster he met earlier is a decoy, actually a department store clerk named Judy Barton. As the audience discovers later, the real Madeleine Elster took a dive off the mission tower. The timing of this revelation disorients the audience. Accustomed to an explanatory conclusion, they may become uncomfortable, as it is what creates tension in the film. The anticipation of the all explanatory conclusion makes for entertainment. Now the focus of the film shifts from the murder to Ferguson, who seemingly has lost his mind in despair for his deceased lover. As he falls deeper into a spiral of despair, Ferguson becomes the confusing character.
While the film follows Ferguson, his motivations and intentions are confusing. At one point, he wants Barton to dress up exactly like Elster. His infatuation with detail makes it unclear if he is in love with Barton, or if he cannot get over the death of the woman he thought he knew. But, the audience does not know if Ferguson knows that Barton is the imposter, so it seems as though his actions are the desperate attempts to resuscitate his lost love. Maybe Ferguson is interested only in the physical appearance of Barton dressed up like Elster, not her real personality. This raises questions, because when he succeeds in making Barton up like the decoy she played earlier, this fantasy realized does not satisfy him. Maybe this is because Ferguson already knows that she is manipulating him yet again. Although Barton shows sympathy for him, she seems to feed off his money and care. All the while, she is hiding the true story behind the murder, which is malicious as it is. By not telling him, she is building up the damage that would be done if Ferguson were to find out the truth. There is no reason why someone in love would subject their lover to the torment of lost love. Even if Barton knew that this revelation would break Ferguson, she should have alerted him to this information.
Barton's motivations become acceptable after Ferguson reads her letter, which creates a flashback showing the circumstances under which she was placed at the time of the murder. It seems as though she did not know that the real Elster would be murdered. At this point in the film, Ferguson is in the position to decide his fate. As a fervent detective, he would destroy his integrity by forgetting Barton was involved, or break the law by not exposing the murder. In the climax of the film as Ferguson and Barton argue and struggle at the top of the tower at the Mission San Juan Bautista, Barton falls to her death. Compared to other endings in film noir, this one is similar in the way that it leaves room for ambiguity. The entire supernatural theme present in the earlier part of the film is left hanging. The true character of Ferguson is also left in question, because his choice is left to chance. A difference between this ending and other noir endings is that it offers a balanced fate for both characters. While Ferguson loses both of his love interests, Barton dies for helping murder another woman. They both get what was coming to them.
But the audience is left hanging as the ending does not tie in the loose ends of the film, such as the supernatural element, the fate of Gavin Elster (who should have been punished himself), and why Ferguson decided to bring Barton to the mission tower in first place. This ambiguity is what characterizes this film structurally as noir. The spiral motif embodied by Ferguson's vertigo (made with rack focus), and the stairs leading to the top of the mission tower. The end of the film seems to spiral off into chance, as it does not answer many of the audience's questions.",10,10,15,9 May 2003
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver as Neo-Noir
","SPOILER AHEAD!!!
Through its underworld milieu, themes of existential angst, chaos, violence, and meaninglessness, the film Taxi Driver is part of the film noir genre. Directed by Martin Scorcese, the film Taxi Driver delves into the bleak life of Travis Bickle (Robert Dinero), a lone taxi driver from Manhattan. Following the tradition of the film noir movement, this film is dark in every way. It uses themes of existential angst, alienation and loneliness, chaos, violence, and disillusionment. As the film digs into Bickle's transformation into his own sick idea of a hero, these themes become more and more apparent. There are also other characteristic noir visual preoccupations, such as water, the darkness, and mist. In addition, being a neo-noir, or `new noir film,' it ties in issues of the day that are important to the mindsets of people that lived in the 1970's. In this way, this film is unique.
The most obvious part of this film that fits into the noir movement is the visual style. I will discuss later how even though this film is in color, (most of the early noirs were black and white) it keeps the same concept in terms of visual style. Dark city streets slick with water from broken fire hydrants, prostitutes, drunks and murderers: an overall sense of trashiness. This is what film noir aimed to show: a gritty look at American life. What differentiates this film as a neo-noir is that it pits a misfit against the underworld, or  as Bickle explains: `All the animals come out at night: Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal'. As Bickle drives aimlessly through the streets, everything he sees is evidence of the underworld at work. There are long shots of Bickle's point of view as he stares at these creatures. One striking example is in a café scene, in which there is a static shot of Bickle's point of view as he stares at a pimp, who is shot unflatteringly from below. This shows Bickle's disgust with the underworld, and preempts his actions toward the end of the film. Bickle's disgust with urban life, especially in New York, is a general theme in film noir. There is a horror in classic film noir at urbanized life, and in Taxi Driver, it is intensified by Bickle's intense feelings.In addition to the gritty look of film noir, another characteristic of its visual style is the constant use of water. This creates symbolic meaning, as well as enhances the milieu by identifying it as film noir (dark city streets and rain soaked pavement). But, Taxi Driver uses a different meaning for water. In films such as Chinatown and The Man Who Wasn't There, death is associated with water, making it a symbol of helplessness and drowning in life. The meaning becomes apparent in Taxi Driver through Bickle's narrative: `April 10, 1972. Thank God for the rain which has helped wash the garbage and trash off the sidewalks' . Water is a symbol of cleanliness in the film, what Bickle is striving for. He develops an intense anger towards what he feels is the scum of the streets. Frequently he encounters water, such as when he runs through the stream from a broken fire hydrant with his cab. This shot is followed by a shot of the windshield wipers wiping the water off the windshield: another visual clue indicating cleansing. Water is a preoccupation in noir, not only because the streets are always wet, but because characters frequently meet near a port or the ocean, etc. It holds different meanings: cleansing, life and death (the rising and falling tides), and life (water is needed to live).
Water is not the only reoccurring visual; there are symbols provided by normal city objects such as signs and traffic. In many critical moments, such as when Bickle attempts to assassinate Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris II), signs such as `No Pedestrians' or `No Parking' appear in frame. It seems that not only are people impervious to Bickle, but signs and objects in his environment contradict him. In this example, he is in a particularly hostile mindset, and for the first time, we see he has shaved his head into a Mohawk; the sign helps contrast his ignorance toward rules (he wants action; he has to do something about the `trash') with the rules. Another good example of this is the sign hanging in the taxi garage that reads: `BE ALERT!! THE SAFE DRIVER IS ALWAYS READY FOR THE UNEXPECTED. SLOW DOWN AND GAUGE SPEED TO ROAD CONDITIONS. YOU CAN'T STOP ON A DIME!' This is another implicit indicator of Bickle's life spiraling out of control. The sign seems to indicate that he is trapped in life, and cannot seem to get himself out of the filth that he despises so greatly. He is stuck in it, its all around him. In the film, he states: `All my life needed was a sense of direction, a sense of someplace to go. I do not believe one should devote his life to morbid self-attention, but should become a person like other people'.The irony is that he is never ready for the unexpected, because he works outrageously long hours, and sees his only purpose as keeping himself busy. The sign identifies the rut that he is in, telling him to be `alienated' and `slow down.'
To intensify Bickle's emotions without symbolic meaning, another visual component is used: expressive lighting. The low-key lights of the streets are used frequently as a backdrop, and the few primary colors included in them are used in tinting certain sequences. The film is predominantly red, as Bickle has a score to settle and plans to kill to do so. An example of this is when he walks out the café and sees a prostitute yelling at her daughter. The entire street seems bathed in red light. As he gets in his car to pull out, it disappears. Primarily because this film is color, it uses light in a different manner than black and white shadows used in typical film noirs, but uses it to similar effect. Black and white noirs use shadow to convey mood and possibly hidden motives, while neo-noir such as Taxi Driver, tend to use color in the same way. The neon lights and car headlights of Manhattan seem to envelop Bickle.
Characteristic of later noir films such as Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly (1955) is extreme self-reflexivity. There are certain time cuts used in Taxi Driver, such as when Travis looks at his cash box in the garage, the camera tilts down, and then in the same shot, he picks it up on the other side. By limiting the view of the action, the camera calls attention to itself.There are some shots that convey Bickle's loneliness and alienation in typical noir tracking shots. The most prominent example of this is when we see Bickle trying to talk things over with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) after their failed date. The camera starts out on Bickle, and slowly tracks right to the hallway, and eventually focuses on an open door as he slowly realizes that she does not want to see him anymore. It signifies their relationship leaving. through the door, and also makes Bickle seem even more pathetic and alone. Film noirs make use of a lot of these complex tracking shots and stagings to reveal information through characters interacting with their setting. In Laura, this is particularly evident with long, static shots that use the setting to convey information. Objects such as paintings, stairwells, and endless amounts of doorways help accomplish this by creating symbolic shapes when characters interact with them. These settings are usually complex, and contain many seemingly random objects which have the tendency to be symbolic.
Like many other films in the noir movement, this film has the dark, gritty visual style that is most easily recognized. But, it is also an update on the movement's preoccupation with the horror of modern urbanized existence. Bickle's disgust with New York city intensifies that of the movement in general, creating a modern (negative) take on urban life. Taxi Driver is neo-noir because it creates an outlook on urban life from the unique view of the 1970's. Only people who had been alive during this time can understand and create a film like this. Events such as the United States' failure in Vietnam are evident in the film: Bickle served in the Marine Corps during the war. This film is a unique neo-noir because it revisits the extremely negative view of urban life found in earlier film noir through the viewpoint of the 1970's.",Null,0,0,9 May 2003
Black Hawk Down," A film that accomplishes its intentions...
","Blackhawk Down, directed by Ridley Scott, is a film based on the book by Mark Bowden about a 1993 U.S. military special-forces battle against an oppressive Somali warlord named Mohamed Farrah Aidid. He cuts off shipments of food at the ports of East Africa in a time of mass starvation in order to build himself an army and raise himself into power. After a brief, but beautifully shot exposition, most of the film takes place in the invasion gone wrong on the streets of Mogadishu. While the film carries a powerful message about the indiscriminateness of war and questions the role of US military aid in other countries, it falls short because the true nature of the story does not allow enough of the characters to be developed as much as they should be. The characters that should carry an emotional obstacle to overcome are trained to suspend fear and do what they are told. Every soldier in the film is willing to help out without question, so the only obstacle they have is to watch out for each other, accomplish their mission, and return alive. Although almost every character shows acts of heroism, including Ranger Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann, played by Josh Hartnett and Delta Sergeant 1st Class Norm 'Hoot' Hooten, played by Eric Bana, it's simply the duty and brotherhood of a soldier that compels them. The editing in this film is excellent; done by Pietro Scalia, who won an Oscar for Best Editing. Since most of the film is a long stretch of action scenes, it was a complex editing job. There are many fast cuts edited together with slow motion, subjective and objective shots. It was an accomplishment to intersperse shots of the enemy's struggle as well. Although the teams of Army Rangers and Delta Commandoes are difficult to track, this lack of direction adds to the chaotic experience of combat. It brings a new appreciation for the rigorous training that these soldiers go through because the audience experiences combat gone wrong, and the courage it takes to endure hardships on the battlefield The cinematography in this film is all very attractive to the eye. The shots in the day are blue and dusty tinted, and at night there are lots of contrasting greens and reds. The real Blackhawk helicopters themselves create an exciting visual element that allows for gorgeous shots of the soldiers cruising past landscapes such as the run down city and glistening ocean. The computer generated `Little Bird' Delta commando helicopters that swoop into the city also allow great long shots of the action. In addition, handheld shots are used frequently in battle scenes to effectively to add to the chaos. Overall the shots are skillfully composed, but due to the amount of action in the film, not every shot has a deeper meaning. Lighting is used extensively in this film to portray emotion, such as when Hooten tells Eversmann to think about withdrawing his men, for example. The sinking feeling as he realizes that he will soon be taken out of the fight and replaced is conveyed with a distinct blue tint and jagged lines of light across Eversmann's face. In the chaos of the battle, and all of the fast cuts in this film, light becomes an important visual indicator of emotion. The theme of the film is a question that nobody knows: should they be fighting another person's war? This film is definitely a strong reminder that the next time our country engages in conflict, things may not go as planned. The film gives off a pacifist stance on the subject of war, but also reaffirms the heroism of the soldiers who are ordered to carry out our country's best interests. Overall this film is a big feat considering the constraints of time in proportion to the large amount of action that took place in the actual fight. It is also realistic in its depiction of the randomness of war: no one can choose who dies or not. Although character development is not as complete as a normal film should be, it is not what this film is supposed to be. Through a visual perspective, it is a successful film in its realistic depiction of the actual event. Through a narrative perspective it is successful in conveying its theme.",Null,0,0,10 December 2002
