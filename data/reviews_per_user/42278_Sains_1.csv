Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Shallow characters. Stilted acting. Poor casting. Don't be suckered!
","The characters are cardboard cut-outs without personality. I found it impossible to care about any of them.The Jar-Jar Binks character and his pseudo-Ebonic speech is entirely irritating.The heroic 'Jedi-Masters' encourage a small child to risk his life by high-speed racing. Didn't seem plausible to me!The scenes where Jedi Masters Samuel L Jackson and Yoda talk together I just could not take seriously. I couldn't get past the fact that SLJ did NOT end each sentence with a swear-word (as he does in many of his roles), and the fact that Yoda sounded exactly the same as the Muppet's Fozzie Bear.Basically a clone of Star Wars 'A New Beginning', but where in 1977 it was new and exciting, today it seems kinda pointless.Don't be suckered into spending your money on this one.",3,0,1,15 July 1999
