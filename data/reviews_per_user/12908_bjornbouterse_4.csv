Skyfall," Bond will return!
",23 movies into the Bond series and someone (Sam Mendes) can still manage to maintain the fantastic Bond experience is beyond words. Not only is this definitely one of the best Bonds but one of my personal favourites. People are saying that there isn't enough action and my response is 'get a grip'. There isn't a film in this world that only has action and you can still take seriously. No good film is without talking. And this film is a terrific Bond. As soon as I heard Sam was directing I had to see. If some other unheard of director was doing it and would have said no immediately. It must have been hard for Craig as well. Casino Royale=Best BondQuantum of Solace=Worst BondSkyfall=Incredible I have no time what so ever for Quantum it is horrific nobody really liked apart from Craig fans and even they didn't really like. I certainly recommend this film to anyone who is a Bond fan or loves film as this one is superb.,10,1,7,11 December 2012
The Godfather: Part II," Not being mean here but of the worst films I have ever scene.
","About six months ago I watched the Godfather Part I and to tell you the truth I thoroughly enjoyed, It had good cast, good story but still not worth number two on IMDb's top 250 and technically every top 100 film list on the web but still I must give it some credit. However today 15.7.12 I layed my eyes upon the masterpiece of terrible films I mean it truly is shockingly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. Robert De Niro's role: My second favourite actor of all time after Jack Nicholson who does proud in practically ever film I've seen with De Niro in until today. I mean what in Gods holy name did he win an Oscar for this pile of **beep** he wasn't even in half the film. Thoroughly disappointed, no wonder he didn't appear at the Academy Awards because he probably thought what the hell I am I doing winning an Oscar for the worlds most boring films ever. He probably felt embarrassed. How people and watch that film and actually enjoy it is beyond me. I don't think I am exaggerating either to be completely honest I only watched the film to the end to see if Michael Corleone died to boy was he getting on my nerves. I sorry if I have offended anyones opinion but if you want to sit and enjoy a film watch Pulp Fiction which by the way on paper if one worse that The Godfather Part II.",Null,9,20,15 July 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Here we go again
","I have just returned from my seven o'clock showing of this fantastic film in dazzling 48 fps in 3D. This film successfully manages to turn a fairly short children's book in whats going to be a epic trilogy. This is no better than TLOTR but no worse either. It gets into the action fairly quickly. And keeps the story solid. I don't normally say this but the critics are very wrong this time. This film should not be faulted for its humour or light touch because thats what the Hobbit is about. Its supposed to be more light hearted than TLOTR. But doesn't seem it. However the goblins and orcs are done very well it almost looks like they have made them look slightly less scary and frightening. This might just be me, but its very well done if it is. All the characters are accurate and well portrayed. For me the 48 fps and 3D kind jumped at me all at once and in some of the action scenes looked slightly too busy. But other than that, the best picture I have ever scene on screen.This may seem strange but I have only just actually taken to Peter Jackson's epics. But now I am in love with middle earth. I would easily rate this film a 9 but because of Bilbos sake a 10. Enjoy!",10,2,8,2 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," It even lived up to its hype
","'Eight years on, a new terrorist leader, Bane, overwhelms Gotham's finest, and the Dark Knight resurfaces to protect a city that has branded him an enemy.' Was the passage I had read a few hundred times before the release date in July. I was litterly drooling over the film. I had pre-ordered my seat weeks before the release and could not wait. And sure enough I saw it and to be true full I didn't like it. I was disappointed partly because of the hype I and the media had made it. But I was sure I was me. So about two weeks later I went to see it again. I loved it! It was amazing. I really felt Nolan's touch to it. The opening scene was one of the best I think I have ever scene. Tom Hardy really shone, almost like Heath Ledger did in its prequel 'The Dark Knight'. The whole story was put together beautifully. From beginning to end. I couldn't rate this film a higher level. It wasn't as good as 'The Dark Knight' but I expected that. A definite 10/10.",10,2,6,7 December 2012
