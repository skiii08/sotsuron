The Blair Witch Project," Plagiarism at it's worst
",I would have given it a '0' but I didn't have that option. Watch 'The Last Broadcast' which was released the year before this movie and you'll have no doubt that this film was a direct rip off. Not to mention 'the Blair Witch Project' absolutely sucked. It's amazing how millions of dollars worth of advertising can suck so many people in. I have to admit I paid $17.50 for the video because it was always out of stock at the video rental store. It took me six months to give my copy away. No one would take it. If you enjoyed 'the Blair Witch Project' you owe it to yourself to check out 'The Last Broadcast'. I'm sure you'll like it a lot more.,1,7,13,11 October 2005
