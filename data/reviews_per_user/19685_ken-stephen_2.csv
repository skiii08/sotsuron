The King's Speech," Moving and Exhilarating
","Some of this year's film awards should be given to this film, without question. The balance of humour and seriousness in the script is near ideal, and the humanity of all the characters comes off the screen very clearly. Helena Bonham Carter in the role of the (young) Queen Elizabeth is priceless, giving a fully-dimensioned portrayal of the woman behind the crown. Colin Firth as King George VI (her husband) here gives the greatest performance of his career to date. The timing of his scenes with Geoffrey Rush is absolute perfection, with both actors conveying the humour and the heartbreak that are equally implicit in the situation. Memorable moments come at the very beginning and end equally, where the radio microphone becomes an important character in its own right, thanks to the inspired direction of Tom Hooper. All the minor parts are cast from strength as well, and even the little princesses (Margaret and Elizabeth, the current Queen) convey a wealth of information in their brief appearances. This film is like a carefully crafted stage play, where every movement, every gesture, every nuance of speech and silence, has a purpose and helps to carry the story behind the story. This film held me spellbound every moment, right from beginning to end, and it came as no surprise when many of the audience began to applaud at the conclusion.",10,0,1,25 December 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Masterpiece for All Time
","Others have written very detailed responses to this film. I simply need to state that this is like no other mainstream studio film ever made. It has been truly said (I'm sorry I can't remember by whom) that Kubrick here created the first true 'motion picture' in the most literal sense of those words. You don't 'watch' this one the way you would watch any other movie. You have to immerse yourself in it, open your mind completely to the visual images, and forget about following the plot or the banal dialogue. Almost all the truly important information and even more, ideas, come through the visuals. I've watched this film in excess of 100 times, and still find more and more in it with every viewing. Very few films can ever claim to be that intense, that deep, that rewarding.",10,5,13,17 February 2011
