Hereditary," Doesn't live up to the hype
","I recently watched this movie and was just left scratching my head over all of the 'scariest movie this decade' type hype. It's not that I didn't think the movie had any good attributes. Some of the acting was very good and the setting was generally creepy. The plot had some potential as well. But it wasn't scary. At best, there were some creepy moments. Nothing that had me on the edge of my seat though. Nothing jarring. The characters started to get on my nerves after a while, perhaps because the movie was overly vague and slow at times. The only one I was left with any sympathy towards the end for was Peter, and mostly just because he had to put up with everyone else. But What really made me dislike the movie was the end. It explains everything and yet still leaves you with a WTF feeling. It goes as far as to undo the creep factor of the entire rest of the movie. It's comically UNscary and poorly executed. To be honest, a really climatic ending might have saved this movie. They blew it.",3,3,6,10 September 2018
