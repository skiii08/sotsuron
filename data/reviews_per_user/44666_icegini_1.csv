The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Trying to get as much money out of the final without enough in return
","I was surprised when I watched the first Twillight movie that I liked it. Vampire movies are not the kind of movies I normally like and all the hype around it wasn't attracting me either. But I surprisingly enjoyed the first movie. A day later I watched the second and third one. The second movie was a bit disappointing but the third one made up first it again and felt at the same level like the first.Yesterday I went to watch the first part of the fourth movie to spend some times with friends. Already not being really a fan of the movies but having enjoyed the first ones, this kind of movies must be pretty good for me to like them. I was okay with the beginning because it had potential, it changed fast in a let's put as much as possible into the movie but all fast and short just so that you know it happened and you've seen it. The hardest job after a movie has sequels which score well with the public is managing to make a good last movie I think. Unfortunately hey didn't manage for the Twillight saga.I am curious about how the second part will be but as the first part gave me a bit an uninterested feeling and the end kind of makes you already know how the second part might go, it won't be a movie I will be watching in the movie theatre.",9,0,8,27 November 2011
