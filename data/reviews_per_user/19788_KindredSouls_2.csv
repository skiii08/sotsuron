3:10 to Yuma," Entertaining from start to finish
","I actually liked the trailer for this movie when it first came out, but for one reason or another didn't go see it at the theaters. I'm sorry I didn't, as westerns are so rare these days and one on the big screen is even more of a rarity. I watched this first on InDemandPPV, and was wrapped up in the action from moment one. I don't see how anyone could say this film is 'slow'. For me, it was non stop entertainment. Even during the parts where there was no gunfighting or battling of any kind, the relationships between the characters kept me riveted to the screen. It really is all about standing up for what is right, having principles, and doing what you have to do even when the odds are stacked against you. It's about finding redemption and understanding in the least likely people and circumstances. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe simply are on fire together. I loved every moment of their interactions, and I would love to see them re-team in something on down the line. They, and their respective characters of Dan Evans and Ben Wade, made the movie for me. It was also nice to see Peter Fonda, and Logan Lerman as Dan's son William was also impressive. The cast overall was a stand-out (they weren't nominated for a SAG award for most outstanding cast for nothing.) All in all, I'd say, a great movie. Not perfect, but if you go in focusing on what you think might never logically happen, you'll miss the magic and beauty of it all. Worth a watch, or even owning a copy. You might need a tissue handy for some of the later scenes. I know I did. Two thumbs up, I loved it !",9,0,1,26 June 2008
The Dark Knight," Just didn't have the emotional impact of Batman Begins
","The only reason I wanted to watch Batman Begins or The Dark Knight was because Christian Bale played Batman. That's it. I think he's one of the best actors in Hollywood today, and I gave BB a chance because of him. He did not disappoint, bringing the right amount of pathos and heroism to the caped crusader, quite possibly creating the best big screen portrayal of the character ever. I really liked Batman Begins because it made us care about everyone in it, we even feel sympathy for the villain because we get at least a glimpse of why he does what he does, and that he has people he once cared about. At one point anyway, we know the villain in the first film wasn't a complete monster. We care about the minor characters because we see that they care about Bruce and/or Bruce cares about them, and we get to know Bruce pretty well. We feel his pain, his anger, his frustration, and we are uplifted by the fact that this man who could so easily choose to be a villain chooses instead to be a hero. Batman Begins, quite simply, tugs at your heartstrings, while providing some good action and a plot. The Dark Knight is just chaos, in every sense of the word. If it was Nolan's intention that most of the time we wouldn't know what was happening or why, he succeeded. I just didn't understand it, to put it plainly. Maybe, since the Joker was a chaotic villain, the movie was supposed to support that. If so, it did it's job. I also couldn't keep up with all the characters, or their purpose. What WAS the point of the focus on the mob? Why the mob, the Joker, and Harvey Dent/Two Face in the same movie, and Gordon's family being threatened in the same movie? There was just too much going on, too much action, and not enough reaction. Alfred was almost nonexistent..and here's the kicker: so was Batman. In a movie about BATMAN, you'd think Christian Bale would have a bigger part. He did a great job with what he was given, but he was almost a glorified extra. Harvey Dent got to show more of a reaction out of Rachel's death than Bruce did. That's a shame. Nolan really needs to go back to basics and put some heart back in the script. It was almost like BB and TDK were directed by two different people. The two movies certainly bear no resemblance to each other. Where was the heart? Sorely missing in this one, I'm afraid. Nlan went all 'style over substance' in TDK. Not impressed. If you're a die-hard fan of any of the actors as I am Bale, or a die-hard Batman fan, it's worth a watch, but otherwise....skip it.",6,5,12,4 August 2008
