Hereditary," Attractively filmed Garbage
","I felt strongly enough about this presentation to write a review and perhaps 
flag a few pointers that may help people decide whether to pay out money
to see this or not. I love a great supernatural story, well told and effectively 
put across on screen. Starting at the beginning there is a promising opening 
scene after the death of the Grandmother. It is poignant and eerie and Toni Collette is unnerving and strange in her potrayal as the not quite grieving Daughter.To give this film it's stripes it does handle creepy and atmospheric scene's well however it's downfall comes when it attempts anything except slow, crawling panning shots, and it is shot VERY slowly. You can almost hear the camera creaking as it moves seemingly forever down a corridor or across treetops, or through a window, or around a spooky room. So the strength of this movie lies in it's atmosphere and it's weakness lies in any attempt to make an interesting or coherent story. As it progresses, after an insufferably long period of time ( I like a story set-up but seriously? ) the performances become more hysteria than reallistic,and the plot ( Yes there is one!!? ) goes uncontrollably off road and hits a symbollic lamp-post. Perhaps if they had stuck to the more ambiguous mental health aspect of Collette's character rather than leaning to the more obvious plot thread it might have made for a more intriguing story.
As for high points, the daughter's performance is unsettling and her story arc
goes to a place I don't think anyone would expect... It is attractively filmed
with all the right technical stuff going on.The advertising has been sinfully 
misleading, clever but misleading and many people will leave the theatre
disappointed and perhaps a bit confused. There were about eight people
in the Sunday night screening I attended and NO-ONE enjoyed it.
As a final point which may come across as sarcastic, it has been compared 
to ' The Witch ' in a number of reviews. Bull-crap. The Witch was a masterfully 
handled psychological horror piece and this IMO garbage is not. If you were thrilled and delighted by the theatrical event that was ' Mother ' then you may well enjoy this. For the majority of us who enjoy our movies with hype they can 
comfortably live up to it will doubtless be forgotten and put down to being
a bad dream. A beautifully shot, ridiculous and non-sensical bad dream. 
And if you want ridiculous then prepare yourself for the last fifteen minutes.
For a ' Horror ' movie it's very funny. I'm not sure if that was it's intention.",2,6,12,18 June 2018
Suicide Squad," chaotic fun
","I have gotten into the habit lately (maybe rightly or not) of walking into movies with pretty low expectations (see Tarzan review) however both times this has happened I have had a great viewing experience.I get the feeling,although not easily swayed that the negativity that many big releases are getting these days pre release is so overwhelming that it becomes hard to focus solely on the movie itself.Bottom line is that the haters may have written off Suicide Squad already and on some points maybe they are right to but having seen it 2D without gimmicks and so on it is well directed and pretty well acted for the most part.The characters are darkly fun and I love the villain twist.I never got bored and loved the Joker (hope he returns) and for 2 hours or so had a really great time watching a popcorn flick which entertains.IMO it delivers the blockbuster side of the deal,but on the flip side the negatives are,sloppily set up,no real tension on building the team,first 45 minutes pretty crude and messy with no real narrative which has any cohesion and 'emotional' scenes when they occur feel slightly shoe-horned in and not massively convincing.Best performances.Margot Robbie,Jared Leto,Viola Davis as Amanda Waller and Jai Courtney who knows about handling a boomerang.",8,6,11,10 August 2016
La La Land," Sometimes more is better than less.
","Okay so. I hate when people start reviews that way BUT this is a bit of a take a breath moment and keep it real. Sometimes in cinema a director/producer/writer etc will try to reinvent a genre. A revival if you like to make something popular again. Horror has been reinvented for generations, as have westerns and periodically, musicals. Unfortunately this movie will not revive the movie musical. As pleasant and mostly well meaning as this is, after hearing mostly positive reviews I walked into the cinema with warm expectations for a couple of hours of guilty pleasure enjoyment and walked out at the end in silence with the rest of the audience in a ' that was quite good ' kind of way. The story is not all engaging.The songs are not overly memorable and the pacing is fairly pretentious. It's a musical that is in denial about BEING a musical.I went to see an early run showing of Les Miserables in an IMAX cinema when it was released and the movie being applauded at the end because people had a fantastic experience. The mostly Luke warm experience of this with the occasional vaguely exciting dance number and the expressive quiet of the audience afterwards leaves nothing really left to say except. Pleasant enough and ultimately forgettable.",7,2,7,16 January 2017
