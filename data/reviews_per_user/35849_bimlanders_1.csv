Your Name.," Beautiful images and...
","Is the cinema a vehicle for beautiful images independent of the narrative purpose of the film? Your Name is one of the most stunningly animated features I have ever seen, but the level of emotional resonance is somewhat far south of my favorite Studio Ghibli Films which this film purports to surpass (or equal.) What is the ultimate point of this movie? The body swapping story is obviously old-hat, but I felt it would lead to something grand, eventually. But (spoilers- don't read reviews when you don't want spoilers!) when the comet angle surfaced, I thought that things might finally get interesting. But instead, the film built up to a climax with basically a Get out of Jail Free Card idea. (I note that Taki summarily rejects a sexpot who is a great person from all evidence, and makes him look like an asshole in the process.) I recall that Isao Takahata's Only Yesterday was supposed to be a merely 'good' animation from Studio Ghibli. Disney wouldn't even release it due to a frank discussion about female periods. But that film made me cry, and several times on a repeat viewing. Now, in that film's quiet, realistic, and understated style, why did I find such deep resonance, but a love story where a comet (spoilers!!!) wipes out an entire town cannot? I have to spread the blame around to all in Creative.That being said, this is a very good animated film from Japan, but I have to say it doesn't quite live up to its hype. It's a bit too emo and heavy handed. There are many parts where the lead characters scream out each other's name. There's no subtlety at all. Me thinks that the amazing images fool people when married to a heavy handed approach to presenting emotional content. Another refresher if you want an awesome coming of age story from Japanese masters, check out Whisper of the Heart. There's nothing in Your Name that matches the awe of Shizuku discovering the antique shop for the first time, and meeting the Baron... (sigh) This, without even bringing up Spirited Away.",7,1,3,3 September 2017
