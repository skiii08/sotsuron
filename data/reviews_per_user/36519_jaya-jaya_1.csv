Ali," great performances wasted on no content film
","Performances stunning, did not know Van Peebles could act so beautifully.All good Giancarlo, Will etc. No content, no content, no content. Told me nothing I did not know and I know next to nothing!! Where is political/religious in depth? What was person- on- street's opinion, both black and white? Very angry that scenes from trailer are either not in movie or seen from different/useless angle.!!!!??? Am only 30 did not know much about this and would have liked some real info, do not care if Ali was a womanizer and I knew anyway!!!",2,1,2,4 March 2002
