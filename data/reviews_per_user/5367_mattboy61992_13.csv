Requiem for a Dream," Dark, depressing, and haunting
","This is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in a long time. I never cry in movies, but I almost cried at the very end. The acting in this movie was fantastic. Marlon Wayans blew my expectations away, I have to say this is his best performance, where he's not doing his usual 'crazy black guy' talk. Jennifer Connelly, Ellen Burstyn, and Jared Leto were excellent also. Overall, this movie isn't for every taste. If you are someone who enjoys life and loves feel-good movies, then don't watch this because nothing in this movie is uplifting, or if you have no problem with dark and depressing movies, then I'm sure you can handle this. If you're someone who is depressed and needs some perspective, then you need to watch this movie. This movie is one that shows the dark side of using drugs and the affect it has on your life.Rating: 9/10",10,0,1,27 September 2009
Star Trek," One of the best movies of 2009
","Before I went to see this movie, I thought Wolverine was a decent way to start off the summer season, that is until I saw Star Trek, and thought it was better than Wolverine on all levels. Star Trek is the definition of a summer blockbuster.It has amazing special effects, good character development, which is what many blockbusters are lacking these days, an intriguing story, and it takes you into another world. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are perfectly cast as Kirk and Spock, Zoe Saldana did a good job as Uhura, Simon Pegg was funny as Scotty, Anton Yelchin was very charismatic as Chekov, and I enjoyed seeing Winona Ryder on screen.Overall, this has what a lot of summer blockbusters are missing, and I would recommend this movie to everyone. It's fun, exciting, powerful, well-acted, and humorous, and you don't need to be a fan of the TV show to like the movie, Star Trek is for everybody.Rating: 9/10",9,2,6,6 September 2009
Public Enemies," a rental
","Public Enemies, which deals with the real-life story of John Dillinger, the most notorious bank robber, isn't as great as people are making it out to be. But it's worth a rental.The acting was pretty good. Johnny Depp, the main star of this movie, carries the whole thing. I wasn't really paying any attention to Christian Bale. But Marion Cotillard, who plays John's love interest did a pretty good job.At first I thought this movie was really good, but afterwards I thought about it and I thought that there were bits and pieces that were exciting, but most of the time, I was bored and staring out into open space. The action is cool, but there is only about 10 minutes of it in the entire film. There wasn't much of a story, and I'm not familiar with the story of John Dillinger. The setting was cool, and the way everyone was acting all 30's was pretty accurate.Overall, if you are a die hard fan of Johnny Depp, you're gonna love this. I am a big fan of his and I enjoyed his performance. If you are a Michael Mann fan, you will also love this. But if gangster movies aren't your cup of tea, then skip this one. I would recommend that you watch this on DVD or TV, because it wasn't anything you need to see in theaters.Rating: 5/10",5,1,2,6 September 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," it was okay
","I saw X-men Origins: Wolverine when it first came out, and I thought it was okay. Before I went to see it, I was EXTREMELY excited about it, but when I saw it, I was kind of disappointed.The action sequences didn't last very long, there was a lot of cameos and not enough character development, the plot was okay, it wasn't as dark or powerful as it should've been, and the special effects were kind of cheesy.Hugh Jackman did a good job as Wolverine, Liev Schreiber also did good as Sabretooth because he took his acting seriously, Taylor Kitsch was okay as Gambit, Will.i.am did better than I expected as John Wraith, and Lynn Collins did an okay job as SIlverfox. But I was hoping for Deadpool to have more screen time. Overall, this movie wasn't bad, but it was very disappointing. Go see the first three X-Men movies, they are much better. If you are a die hard X-Men fan, you will be a little disappointed. It wasn't atrocious, it could've been way worse, but it's a way to kill a Saturday afternoon.Rating: 5/10",5,0,2,6 September 2009
Orphan," Dark, chilling, and atmospheric
","Orphan seems like a typical, cheesy horror flick. But it's not. It relies heavily on suspense rather than gore. There are a few gory deaths in the movie.The acting is well-done. Vera Farmiga plays the no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners mother. Peter Sarsgaard plays the clueless, loving father. Isabelle Fuhrmann plays the orphaned girl, and was really creepy,and CCH Pounder plays the caring nun.If you've seen the trailer for Orphan, you'll think that is a typical clichéd horror flick. But it is more than that, because it has a horrific twist, and a dark, eerie mood. Sadly, it didn't do that well at the box office because people chose to waste their money on watching secret agent guinea pigs and a clichéd romantic comedy.Overall, if you are a gore hound, you will be a little dissatisfied. If you are a horror fan who doesn't crave a cheesy, poorly edited PG-13 'horror' flick, then you will love this. It comes out on the same week as Halloween. When it does, rent it and watch it on Halloween night, turn the lights off, and you're in for a good, old-fashioned scare.Rating:8/10",8,2,4,20 September 2009
X-Men," Stylish, action-packed, well-made
","X-Men is one of Marvel's few successful film adaptations that manages to give us a fun sci-fi flick while giving us a meaningful story.The Good: 1. Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Ian McKellan are acting powerhouses as Professor X, Wolverine, and Magneto.2. The story. Even though the story wasn't really in the comics, it still portrays the conflict between Professor X and Magneto who are both fighting for the same ideal but with different points of view.3. The special effects were spectacular and managed not to make the film style over substance.4. The supporting cast, including James Marsden, Famke Janssen, and Bruce Davison, all do a terrific job.5. The score was terrific 6. The film manages to fit in some humorous parts to give the film a lighter touch, in the midst of the dark tone of the film The bad: 1. How Rogue's look and personality was much different from the comics.2. Halle Berry's African accent when she played Storm.Overall, this is a fun sci-fi flick and it is easy to see why the superhero genre has taken a successful turn since the film's release. This film is highly recommended and simply rocks.Rating: 8.5/10",Null,0,1,3 September 2011
Watchmen," Mind-blowingly AMAZING!!!!
","Watchmen is a compelling superhero story that is unlike anything I have ever seen before, this was incredibly new, and amazing. No other superhero movie is better than this. Here is why: It has a plot, it's not like a sitcom like Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider, it has character development, and amazing special effects and visuals. Also, I liked the setting.The actors in this movie did a really great job. Jackie Earle Haley plays the angry, vengeful Rorschach, Matthew Goode plays the wealthy, mysterious Ozymandias, Patrick Wilson plays the confused Nite Owl, Malin Akerman plays the sexual Silk Spectre, Billy Crudup plays the god-like Dr. Manhattan, who is the only one in the group who has superpowers, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the violent Comedian. The violent scenes were awesome, the story was very powerful, and had plenty of twists and turns, the characters were interesting, especially the Comedian, who was the Watchmen's downfall. Overall, this is a masterpiece and one of my all-time favorite movies. If you have any plans in the near future to see this, and get to the video store and rent it. I highly recommend this because this isn't your typical superhero movie.Rating:10/10",10,19,34,27 September 2009
Edward Scissorhands," A masterpiece
","Edward Scissorhands is one of my all-time favorite movies, and is something I could watch over and over again.Here, Johnny Depp gives his best performance. It's amazing how he went from a bad boy role in Cry Baby with a sad, vulnerable character in Edward Scissorhands.This is also Burton's best work. If this is the first film you watch by Tim Burton, you will think he is a fantastic director. Danny Elfman's score also helped the film because it's happy at the right times, and it's sad and mellow at the right times.Overall, the story was very heartfelt and emotional, the score was amazing, the acting was superb, and the suburban setting gave the film a fairy tale feel to it. Because the film is like a fairy tale. Rating: 9.5/10",9,0,0,24 October 2009
American History X," This movie left me speechless
","After watching American History X, I stood in silence because it was so amazing that I had nothing to say.Words can't describe how fantastic Edward Norton was in this movie. I felt he was cheated out of a Best Actor win. Warning: This is a tough one to watch. This is NOT for every taste. If you like violent movies, you may even be disturbed by this movie. If you know someone who is a skinhead, have them watch this movie so they can learn from their mistakes. Again, this isn't for every taste, this isn't a fun movie or an entertaining movie, but it is a masterpiece.Rating: 9.5/10",10,0,5,27 September 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Ho-hum
","Why this movie was made? I don't know. Why these books were even written? I don't know. Why this movie made so much money at the box office? I still don't know. The point is, I don't see what the whole fuss is about. Let me start off with the acting. Kirsten Stewart, who plays Bella, looked like she was about to fall asleep on screen. Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward, was like an emotionless alien, like in the first one. I think Taylor Lautner wasn't paid to star in this movie, and was paid to show off his muscular physique. Even though he seems like a nice guy in real life, his acting in this was bland, and during the second half of the movie, he was acting like an obsessive stalker.The vampires in these movies don't even have sharp fangs. The ones in movies like 30 Days of Night and Bram Stoker's Dracula are real vampires, because they don't sparkle in the sun or whine about their feelings. I was unimpressed with the werewolves because they were hardly in it, and they weren't very impressive looking. The ones in movies like Ginger Snaps and the Howling are real werewolves, but these weren't very brutal or vicious as werewolves should be.Overall, this is a pile of crud and deserves to be unwatched by everyone, and they should've had Buffy or Blade come in to slay the Cullens. It's a vampire romance film, and I would say watch 'Let the Right One In' instead and it has vampires and werewolves feuding against each other, but I would say watch the Underworld movies instead.Rating: 3/10",1,15,26,23 November 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Simply Amazing
","When I went to go see Alice in Wonderland in theaters, I had high expectations but surprisingly, it surpassed those expectations.First off, the acting was really great, even from the actors playing the animals. Johnny Depp was fantastic, as always, but for me, the scene stealer was Helena Bonham Carter, as the sadistic, cruel yet naive Red Queen. Also, Mia Wasikowska, who played Alice, did a really good job.The visuals in this film are stunning, and I loved how Tim Burton managed to make it mature enough for adults and suitable for children. This is now one of my top 5 Tim Burton films.Overall, this is one I highly recommend to everyone.Rating: 10.5/10",10,0,1,30 June 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Finally, something original
","When I saw Drag Me to Hell, I thought it was very well-made and decent. The main reason I loved this movie because it was something original, which is rare in the horror movie business these days. So far, this is one of the best movies of the year.I had really high expectations going into this movie, despite the fact that it was a horror movie that was rated PG-13. I was excited because it was made by the same people who made The Evil Dead, which is one of my all-time favorite horror movies. Also, Alison Lohman, who plays the lead, wasn't the girl screaming and whimpering multiple times, she was someone who was determined and took risks to get what she wanted. Lorna Raver, who plays Mrs. Ganush, the villain, was creepy as hell. No pun intended.Overall, this movie is very well-done, the scary scenes had perfect timing, and the story was well-structured. It was a horror movie that knew its tone, which was a bit campy. This is definitely one horror movie to check out.Rating: 7.5/10",7,3,6,20 September 2009
X-Men: First Class," Best X-Men movie since X2
","Before I walked into this film, I didn't have sky-high expectations, but after I walked out, I realized the X-Men franchise is back on its feet.Even if it wasn't 100% accurate, I was still able to have fun with the story, the characters, the action, and even, the two surprise cameos.1. The relationship between Professor X and Magneto was portrayed phenomenally, by being portrayed similarly to the Martin Luther King, Jr/Malcolm X conflict. Both about two men fighting for the same ideal with different points of view 2. The 1960's setting was a perfect setting for some of the mutants 3. Kevin Bacon played a kick-ass villain as Sebastian Shaw.4. The young, supporting cast did a superb job. But for me, the standout performance was Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, who undergoes a struggle throughout the film of whether to accept her mutation or be accepted by society 5. January Jones was sexy as hell as the chilly babe Emma Frost, and played the role as sort of a James Bond-type femme fatale.6. Instead of just the special effects, which were amazing, the story and the character development were the driving force behind the film, which to me, is one of the highest points of the film, aside from the best thing about the film....7. Michael Fassbender's EPIC portrayal as Magneto. He embodies the character's lust for vengeance, devotion to an ideal, and descent into madness, PERFECTLY. I'd say i haven't seen a more perfectly-realized comic book villain since Heath Ledger as The Joker.The Bad:1. How Professor X and Megneto were given their names2. Some of the young actors weren't given much screen timeOverall, I highly recommend this to both X-Men and non-X-Men fans, and after watching this, am anticipating a sequel, that hopefully will have more Fassbender.Rating: 9.5/10",Null,0,2,19 August 2011
