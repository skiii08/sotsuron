The Mask," Jim Carrey at his slapstick best
","On the face of it (sorry, couldn't resist), The Mask is a fairly awful movie. The story is ridiculous and the acting, by and large, is quite atrocious. It's essentially a cartoon with real-life humans superimposed onto it. However, thanks to the sheer brilliance of Jim Carrey, it's actually quite enjoyable. Carrey doesn't just provide huge comedy value with his hilarious slapstick antics as The Mask, he also plays the tepid Stanley Ipkiss delicately and with great restraint. His adorable sidekick Milo is a showstopper and really adds to the feelgood factor.And has there ever been a more perfectly beautiful woman than Cameron Diaz in this movie? The teenage version of me that first watched this in the 90s would probably say no.As long as you aren't expecting anything more than a screwball comedy with an over-the-top storyline and pantomime acting, I would highly recommend The Mask. It's goofy and flamboyant and Carrey is brilliant. It drags on a little too long and the bad guys get a bit tiresome but it's still a very entertaining watch.",6,0,1,10 April 2020
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Fairly entertaining but far from Baron Cohen's best work
","I was always a big fan of the Borat skits on 'Da Ali G Show' and loved the shockumentary style humour. Borat doesn't have the same incisive ability to destroy his subjects as Ali G but his clumsy slapstick act is very witty and strangely charming. Overall though, the film fell a bit flat. It kind of felt like Baron Cohen had used all his best jokes on the TV show and, as a result, the movie felt a bit stale and repetitive.I appreciate the fact that there was an attempt at an actual storyline (however flimsy) rather than just presenting a collection of unrelated clips like in the Jackass movies. I found some scenes to be highly entertaining, particularly the naked fight with Bagatov in the hotel and the Jewish bed-and-breakfast escape.What Sacha Baron Cohen does best is to humiliate deplorable people in a wonderfully subtle manner. The scene where he travels with the repulsive frat-boys is probably the best example of this, but the Virginian Rodeo and the Pentecostal church intervention were also quite shocking. I generally found these scenes more uncomfortable than entertaining, but I guess if the goal was to expose bigotry and stupidity, this is perfect execution.I must say I strongly disagree with the idea that this movie is bold, daring and outrageous. The people Baron Cohen goes after (religious nuts, upper-class toffs, feminists, frat-boys etc) are low-hanging fruit for an act like Borat. There is a certainly an element of danger when it comes to potentially being attacked in public, but there is nothing edgy or outrageous going on here. It's not a problem for me (I'm just here for the comedy) but it irks me that people think Baron Cohen is some kind of taboo-breaking social anarchist.Borat certainly provides a good laugh but it lacks ingenuity and gets a bit tiresome in places. I would rather re-watch the original TV clips than watch the movie again.",6,0,1,16 April 2020
Gremlins," The more extreme end of 80s family films
","Gremlins is undoubtedly one of the most bizarre eighties films and appears to be quite polarizing amongst viewers. The concept of the film is imaginative and intriguing, and it arguably could have been a much bigger success with better writing and stronger characters. Unfortunately, the pacing of the film is very uneven and the story just doesn't flow very well. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates are quite dull and Corey Feldman is criminally underutilised.The puppetry looks heavily dated now but for 1984 I guess its acceptable. Mogwai is very cute, bordering on sickly, and the Gremlins are a bit over-the-top but good fun to watch. Things get a bit gory towards the end, enough to make the film unsuitable for many children. And this is where the problem lies, because Gremlins is simply not interesting enough for adults either. It ends up as a kind of tongue-in-cheek indie film which I'm not sure was the intention.I remember enjoying it as a kid but looking back I'm not sure why. There are many better films from this era that are either just straight up horror movies or endearing fantasies.",5,3,3,13 April 2020
The Hangover," High quality comedy let down by the appalling Mr Chow
","One of the better comedies of recent years but probably still a little overrated. The main cast are solid, although Zach Galifianakis' character is a little overdone and Bradley Cooper is way too stylised. Ed Helms is my personal favourite and remains so through all 3 movies.The inclusion of Chow is by far the biggest downfall of this film (it gets even worse with the sequels) and brings the quality down significantly. Such a terribly written character and played atrociously by Ken Jeong. Not sure why they would ruin such a good movie with such an unnecessarily slapstick character like this.",7,0,3,26 April 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Ford, Spielberg and Williams take a bow, Lucas not so much.
","I can certainly understand why this film has such a cult following. The direction by Spielberg is as good as you'd expect, with some particularly incredible stunt choreography. This is probably one of the cleanest looking films of the eighties, drenched in vivid colour and containing some dazzling special effects. And of course the John Williams score is iconic and perfectly fitted to the film. But it's Harrison Ford's performance that steals the show and is arguably the main reason for the popularity of the Indiana Jones series. He looks perfect for this role and delivers just the right balance of dryness and bravado, working well with a fairly unimpressive support cast.Despite all this, I never found Raiders to be a particularly good story. It's all a bit excessive and farcical, and having a completely invulnerable lead character just devalues the action scenes. I do feel nostalgia is a big contributor to the film's high ratings, similar to the equally overhyped Rocky series. Good fun but a bit too slapstick to really be considered a classic.",7,1,1,19 April 2020
Monty Python's Life of Brian," It's not the greatest comedy ever made, it's just a very naughty bit of satire
","I can certainly understand why Life of Brian is cherished by so many and I thoroughly enjoy the dry satire and transparent mocking of organised religion. However, I personally find the Monty Python style just works better with sketches rather than feature-length films. The film became quite tiresome for me and much of it was merely fluff punctuated by moments of genius.",6,3,4,19 May 2020
Wayne's World," Good clean nineties fun
","I've always found Mike Myers to be something of an acquired taste and struggle to warm to his work. Wayne's World is the one exception, and surely the highlight of his career. The film is fairly novel in its design and has a lot of very witty moments. Dana Carvey is arguably the star of the show, playing the uniquely amusing Garth to perfection. Tia Carrere and Rob Lowe round out a pretty strong cast with decent, if slightly cheesy, performances.I would agree that the film has aged a lot since its release, but it serves as a cultural reference point and will remain a very nostalgic and enjoyable viewing experience for people of a certain age. The subversive takes on mainstream films become a bit tiresome and the love triangle story is a little corny but this is not a film that needs analysing in great detail. A fun movie, with its own unique vibe and styling.",6,1,1,13 April 2020
Darkest Hour," One of the great lead performances of recent years
","While the film itself gets a bit bogged down in places, Gary Oldman produces a truly mesmerising performance and is well worth his Oscar.This is one of the best characterisations I can remember seeing and while much of the film is a bit forgettable, Oldman makes it a wholly enjoyable experience. The excellent supporting cast of Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James and Ben Mendelsohn also shine in fairly demanding roles.The now infamous train scene is faintly hilarious but, set against the overall dourness of the story and setting, was actually quite welcome in my eyes. Then again I enjoyed the John Lennon scene in Yesterday so what do I know?",8,0,0,17 April 2020
12 Monkeys," A solid piece of sci-fi let down by a lazy finale
","As far as psychological thrillers go, I guess 12 Monkeys is one of the better ones. However, I would have to question whether it deserves the acclaim it received. The concept is exciting, and considering this is from the mid-90s, I guess its fairly original too. Unfortunately, the film is let down by some sloppy character development and a very rushed ending that feels like an afterthought and devalues the entire viewing experience.I'm not much of a Bruce Willis fan but I quite liked him in this movie. The role is a good fit for his style and he carries the film very nicely for the most part. I did feel there was some very inconsistent writing of his character however, as we see him inexplicably transform from being barely conscious and almost illegible to suddenly turning into a nineties Jack Bauer. As for Brad Pitt, well it's certainly a fun performance and one of the most enjoyable aspects of the film, but the Oscar nomination is probably a bit of an overreaction. His twitchy manic qualities are just a shade too excessive and make his character almost cartoonish.Overall, I quite liked the pacing, the atmosphere and the lead performances. The plot was intriguing but unfortunately it unravelled somewhat towards the end. A very compelling time-travel dystopic that just falls a bit short in places.",7,0,2,14 April 2020
42," A fascinating story, well-presented and well-told
","There are countless films that tackles the issue of racism in 20th century America, and 42 is one of the more heart-wrenching that I've seen. Some scenes are enough to make you feel physically ill, not to mention angry and devastated. The story is fascinating, heart-warming (eventually) and well-portrayed, although I found Chadwick Boseman's performance a little flat.The film is prone to excessive sentimentality at times and isn't helped by a very corny supporting performance from Nicole Behari, who is scarcely believable as Rachel Robinson. There are plenty of times when it feels like the underlying message is being forced down your throat, which is completely unnecessary and a little tiresome.Regardless, this is an interesting movie that serves as a very confronting reminder of how grotesque racism can be. Not a classic but well worth watching.",7,0,0,13 April 2020
Shaun of the Dead," This is what good comedy looks like
","There are few comedy films as perfectly observed and constructed as Shaun of the Dead. The meticulous balance between sharp biting humour and an actual engaging (and often quite frightening) story makes this one of the most accomplished films in its genre in the last few decades. The quality of writing makes a complete mockery of the turgid vulgarity churned out by Hollywood in the name of humour. As far as satire goes, this is a masterpiece.",8,0,0,18 May 2020
Rocky V," Another tired sequel but still watchable
","After the debacle of Rocky IV, expectations were not high for this final instalment. However, despite its generally poor reception, I don't mind this movie all that much.There is certainly a bit of a change up in the plot with the introduction of Rocky Jr as a more prominent character and with Rocky taking on a coaching role. The late Sage Stallone does a solid job as Rocky Jr and his 'beat the bullies' story arc is reasonably engaging. Sly Stallone and Tommy Morrison however, are atrocious throughout this film and don't even seem like they really care about this tired plot. Tommy Gunn is comfortably the worst villain in all the Rocky movies and Morrison was a very poor casting choice.But despite all this, Rocky V is reasonably entertaining. Richard Grant is hilarious and the production and music are as good as ever. Not a great way to round things up but not a total flop either.",5,0,1,13 April 2020
Happy Gilmore," Harness in the good Adam Sandler film, block out the bad
","I think it's fair to say that this is the best Adam Sandler movie. Happy Gilmore lacks the cheesiness and self-satisfaction of most of Sandler's work and is all the better for it. Sandler himself is a terrible actor so playing a complete simpleton is comfortably the best role for him. Christopher McDonald is excellent as Shooter McGavin and Richard Kiel's cameo is hilarious. The jokes are inane and crass, the characters are ridiculous and the storyline is farcical but it all kind of works in its own funky way.",7,0,0,24 May 2020
Creed," A surprisingly impressive reboo
","Considering I never particularly liked the original Rocky movies, I was not expecting much from this latest offering. It sounded like a truly terrible idea, especially as 2006's Rocky Balboa had provided a very satisfactory ending to the series. I chose to watch it more out of morbid curiosity than anything else and I was fully expecting to hate it. As it happens, it's actually pretty impressive. The production is excellent, the acting is superior to the originals and the fight scenes are visually spectacular and well-choreographed. The shot of Creed hitting the deck in slow-motion in the final fight is an amazing piece of cinematography. Ryan Coogler does a great job with the writing and it makes you wonder how much better the original sequels could have been had Stallone allowed someone else to take over the screenplay.Stallone gives probably his best performance across all the Rocky films (and maybe his career), thriving in his role as a lonely bereaved restaurant manager. His gentle handling of the cancer storyline was exceptional, culminating in an incredibly moving final scene where he scales the famous Philadelphia steps at walking pace.I was very sceptical of Tony Bellew being offered a role in this film, but he gives a surprisingly strong performance. Admittedly, he is only really playing himself and he's used to the cameras, but It's still an achievement to translate it to the big screen so well. I was less impressed by Michael B. Jordan however, who I felt was wooden and monotonous throughout.In fact, the whole Adonis Creed character was a bit of a let-down. A kid who spent his early days in foster care, has never known his parents and who possesses the physical and psychological traits of Apollo Creed has the potential to be a mesmerising lead character. The development of Adonis could and should have been the essence of this movie. We could have seen a fiercely emotional tortured soul, finding meaning and purpose in sport. Instead, he was nothing more than a forgettable walking cliché. His relationship with Bianca was also very drab and it wasn't helped by Tessa Thompson's tepid performance.I was still very impressed with Creed and would recommend it. It's just a shame more work wasn't put into creating a stronger lead character.",7,0,0,13 April 2020
Hot Fuzz," Simon Pegg delivers again
","Given the weighty standards set by Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz is a pretty solid sequel of sorts. The dry sardonic humour is on show again, albeit a little overdone at times, and Simon Pegg and Nick Frost give thoroughly enjoyable lead performances. There is something extremely pleasant about films set in the English countryside and it is a great backdrop for black comedy. I felt the film was let down by a needlessly excessive finale that dragged on way too long. However, despite some flaws, this is still a cut above the majority of one-dimensional mainstream comedies that clutter the market today.",7,0,0,18 May 2020
Home Alone," Charming, amusing and a little dark
","As much as I dislike John Hughes' work, I really do enjoy Home Alone and consider it one of the best Christmas films of my lifetime. Macauley Culkin steals the show with a charming lead performance, even if his character is a little cheesy at times (this gets a hell of a lot worse in the sequel).The rest of the cast is very strong, and there are some really nice scenes involving John Candy and Catherine O'Hara. The humour can be a little dark at times, and the finale is actually quite awful when you think about it- two grown man literally trying to kill a child. But if you're not enjoying this as light-hearted slapstick, you should probably avoid any film made before 2010. Good family fun that still feels fresh 30 years on.",7,0,0,13 April 2020
The Terminator," This is what an action film should look like
","Without doubt, one of the best films ever made in the sci-fi action genre. The Terminator is incredibly atmospheric, with impressive special effects for the era and a menacing score. Schwarzenegger is perfectly utilised and could not be a better fit for the role. Linda Hamilton also gives a strong performance, developing rapidly and authentically from girl-next-door to cyborg-destroyer in a very short space of time. We also see one of the few sex scenes in a blockbuster film that has genuine feeling to it, resulting from a delicately engineered chemistry between Hamilton and Michael Biehn. Compared to the cluttered flamboyant action films that have preceded it, Terminator is clean, minimalist and unpretentious. A genuine classic.",9,0,0,6 May 2020
Molly's Game," Great lead performances help tell a fascinating story
","While I didn't particularly like the structure or length of the film, Jessica Chastain's performance was enough for it to be a definite success. I was expecting this to play out like a corny sports movie but its actually quite authentic with little to no glamorising of Bloom herself and poker games that are actually portrayed realistically- quite a rarity in Hollywood movies. I would certainly have preferred a more fluid telling of the story, with less interlacing of the two timelines and a shorter runtime. However, thanks to excellent supporting performances from Idris Elba and Kevin Costner, many of the extraneous scenes were perfectly enjoyable. I did find the overall tone of the film to be a little ostentatious but there is more than enough substance to make this a fairly memorable experience.",7,0,0,6 May 2020
Blades of Glory," Simple pleasing comedy
","Despite its underwhelming reception, I actually rate this as one of the better goofy comedies of recent years. Ferrell and Heder make a surprisingly strong pair and play off each other very nicely. Ferrell's use of his face and body are particularly hilarious. The jokes are fairly obvious but are delivered very well by this solid cast. I was also quite impressed by the skating scenes which are well choreographed and well edited. Blades of Glory is short and succinct which is a blessed relief after sitting through many turgid indulgent marathons in this genre.",7,0,6,21 May 2020
Horrible Bosses," Lame offensive drivel
","This is actually a decent concept for a comedy, but like so many other mainstream Hollywood films this century, it falls painfully short. The three main characters are borderline tropes and Charlie Day is particularly atrocious, overcooking every line. Jennifer Aniston's character is completely over the top and the sexual abuse gender reversal dynamic is a horrific miscalculation by the writers. People being upset with this theme is not a a case of political correctness gone mad, it is a rational reaction to a distasteful and unacceptable part of the movie.This is a film that tries to be dark and edgy but is still just predictable formulaic vulgarity. It's a huge shame to see talented actors like Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx and Jason Bateman drawn into these lowbrow films as they are all capable of so much more.",4,0,1,29 April 2020
Rocky II," Repetitive, pointless and tedious
","I'm not sure exactly what the point of this movie was. The storyline is very similar to the first film, the finale is just as ridiculous and we are again subjected to endless Balboa ramblings. It is also painfully slow and unnecessarily long.The movie is beautifully produced and Bill Conti's soundtrack is excellent, arguably even better than the original. One thing you cannot deny about Rocky movies is that they all look and sound amazing.The Balboa vs Creed rematch is much more exciting and comprehensive than the original bout and is very well directed. However, it is absolutely ludicrous that these men could take such a beating and come out of it alive.This is also an extremely corny film. Mickey is almost a cartoon character at times and the workout montages are incredibly tacky, especially the scene where hordes of children chase Rocky down the street (and across a busy main road). Even in only it's second incarnation, the Rocky franchise is starting to become a parody of itself.Talia Shire is excellent as Adrian and continues to be the highlight of these films. Carl Weathers also gives a strong performance, injecting some more authenticity and likeability into the Creed character.Fans of the first movie will probably be very happy with this but personally I couldn't quite see the point of it.",5,0,0,13 April 2020
American Pie," Brilliantly grotesque
","One of the classic teen comedies. Maybe not the most polished film in this genre, but certainly one of the most charismatic and enjoyable. Jason Biggs' comic acting skills are highly underrated and, in my opinion, the primary reason for American Pie becoming so successful. Him and Eugene Levy make for an extremely likeable and equally hilarious father and son double act.The film loses a mark for the awful 'Kevin' character played by Thomas Nicholas who is just excruciating to watch. Thankfully, the rest of this great cast do a good job of drowning out his persistent soppiness. The love story between Chris Klein and Mena Suvari is very nicely executed for a teen comedy and manages to be sweet without becoming sickly.Now over 20 years old, American Pie is still pretty fresh and as enjoyable as ever. It's also one of the few successful comedy films that has spawned decent sequels.",7,0,0,21 April 2020
Man of Steel," Burnt on the outside, raw in the middle
","Like so many modern action movies, Man of Steel is a serious case of style over substance. The action scenes are so over-the-top they actually become stressful to watch. I had virtually no idea what was even happening at some points, and to be honest, I didn't really care. The CGI is overwhelming and it feels like the editing team are simply showing off what they are capable of rather than trying to present something meaningful.Underneath all this ostentation is an array of horribly thin characters. Henry Cavill looks like Andy Murray on steroids and has the charisma to match. I don't expect Christopher Reeve levels of charm and likeability but Cavill is drab and insipid throughout, and his Clark Kent is barely distinguishable from his Superman. Michael Shannon had a tough job following Terence Stamps wonderfully camp portrayal of General Zod in Superman II, and he falls well short here. His performance was completely lacking in humour and charm, and his sidekicks were equally bland and one-dimensional. Amy Adams, who I rate as one of the better mainstream Hollywood actors, gets it all horribly wrong as Lois Lane. She seems to be torn between damsel in distress and strong independent woman and ends up just being nothing whatsoever. The worst performance in Man of Steel, however, is claimed by Russell Crowe who is tedious and pompous as Jor-El, and suffocates every scene he is involved in.The story is obvious, boring and excessive. Superman is unrecognisable from previous incarnations and the bad guys are just unimaginative gruel. The whole DCEU franchise gets off to a predictably bad start, and I dread to think what follows next.",2,4,13,13 April 2020
Grease," Divisive, controversial and extremely camp
","It's hard to describe just how much I hate musicals, but I can just about tolerate this relatively enjoyable adaptation. Grease is far from perfect and, for a 110-minute film, there isn't much of a storyline to speak of. A lot of the acting is pretty abysmal and there are some dubious messages about what it means and what it takes to be popular. There are also some highly sexist moments that are hard to accept regardless of when this movie was made. Despite all this, the gloriously camp performance of John Travolta and the legendary soundtrack are enough to make this an iconic classic for many viewers.The film is very pretty, with the crisp colours of the 50s and a visually dazzling cast. Travolta is absolutely mesmerising as Danny Zuko and dominates every scene he is involved in. Olivia Newton-John is perfectly lovely although her acting is quite wooden and a little childish at times. I never felt much of a chemistry between these two characters, and the trajectory of their romance doesn't feel particularly believable. Stockard Channing aside, the rest of the cast are fairly useless and many scenes are quite painful to watch.The music is amazing, just pure unadulterated fun. Four decades later and it sounds as fresh and charming as ever. There is an innocence about this music, this era and these characters which may be overidealistic but certainly creates a great feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived through this time period. I can understand the highly polarized reviews of Grease; it is both fresh yet dated, charming yet disturbing, edgy yet corny. A fascinating part of 20th century pop culture that makes you question if we have gone forward or backward as a society.",6,0,1,13 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The best yet, sets the stage nicely for the grand finale
","The decision to split the Deathly Hallows into two parts was not just welcome, but basically imperative. We are finally able to see a more comprehensive telling of the story and the film is all the better for it.There is a significant leap in quality in the Deathly Hallows, in terms of both entertainment value and production quality. It is far more atmospheric than it's predecessors and the quality of acting is significantly improved.The story whips along without feeling rushed or compromised and the whole film is gripping and enjoyable. Had all the movies been of this quality, the Harry Potter film series could have been legendary.",7,0,0,14 April 2020
American Beauty," A memorable film but not Oscar-worthy
","While American Beauty has a novel and unique story, I'm not sure it is as edgy and profound as many people seem to think it is. The characters are basically all horrible and their behaviours are far too excessive to be believable.The scenes with the brooding teenage boy and his escape into photography are all a bit teen-angst melodrama, which is fairly indicative of the movie's pretentiousness. It is still highly entertaining and often hilarious but the one-dimensional characters prevent it from being a masterpiece.",7,1,3,30 April 2020
Warrior," Nearly the film that Rocky should have been
","Without doubt one of the most frustrating films I have seen in recent years. The performances of Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte are absolutely mesmerising and had the story been focused purely on the development of these two characters, this could have been the best fighting film ever made.Instead we are subjected to a cliche-ridden piece of melodrama that is as predictable as it is sickly. There was no need to even include the Brendan character, as there was more than enough substance from the dynamic between Hardy and Nolte to make this film Oscar-worthy. The idea of a 30+ year old schoolteacher coming out of retirement to beat an undefeated UFC champion in his prime is an insult to the viewers and cheapens the entire production. The fact that two alienated brothers should meet in the final of such a prestigious event is equally ridiculous. On top of that we have the ridiculous overlay of commentary making it known exactly how meaningful everything is, just in case we were dumb enough to miss it.This really should have been an Oscar-winner. The direction is incredible, the acting even better and it is one of the few fight films with accurate choreography. But it falls prey to an unforgivably corny script and ends being a huge waste of an incredible cast. This could and should have been Hardy's crowning moment but instead he is made to surrender the limelight to Joel Edgerton's paint-by-numbers hero.",7,0,1,23 April 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," 'How are we supposed to know?'
","One of the few genuinely great sequels. After the menacing masterpiece of The Terminator, Judgment Day manages to successfully develop the story without treading over old ground or losing the qualities that made the original so special. Linda Hamilton continues her progression to genuine action hero and Schwarzenegger's re-purposing as a good guy allows him to express himself slightly more as an actor. He brings a very subtle level of sweetness and humour to the role that is underappreciated. My main issue with the film is the final 30-40 minutes which become a little childish. The final showdown is dragged out unnecessarily and the setting is like something out of an arcade game. Despite that, the movie still sits head and shoulders above the vast majority of sci-fi and action films of the last few decades.",8,0,0,6 May 2020
Rocky IV," Cheating death and ending the Cold War, just another day for Rocky
","The fourth instalment of Rocky is by far the worst of the lot. This is one of those movies that is so bad it's almost comical. It is so ridiculously corny that it actually starts to feel like a parody of the first 3 films.The plot is as predictable as ever with the cheesy workout montages coming thick and fast. At one point we see Rocky doing real-life versions of Drago's hi-tec gym regime with the implicit message that good old-fashioned US work ethic will overcome Soviet scientific advances. The final fight is horrifically unrealistic and once again, we see Rocky endure a beating that would kill any mortal human being multiple times.For some unknown reason, the whole movie seems to be an attempt at a political message, culminating in a truly dreadful ending where Rocky's 'progressive' victory speech appears to instantly diffuse decades of East-West tension. The portrayal of Russians throughout this movie is lazy and offensive, particularly the politicians.Balboa, who looked at his physical peak in Rocky III, now looks like a heavy steroid user. Dolph Lungdren looks great but his dialogue is so atrocious he may as well be a cartoon character. 'I must destroy you' and 'If he dies, he dies' are some of his personal highlights. Even Talia Shire is dragged down by this film, morphing into one of those trite sporting wives who just bleats clichés from the sidelines.An absolute disaster of a movie, only to be enjoyed ironically.",2,0,2,13 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," An improvement on the first two movies but still very underwhelming
","While I wouldn't exactly be in a hurry to watch it again, the third instalment in the series was probably my favourite so far. It is still prone to atrocious acting from Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, as well as more unforgivably poor special effects, but the story is much less cluttered and contains plenty of exciting, well-executed sequences.However, we still see all the trademarks of Rowling's weak writing. The Superman-style 'turn-back-time' plot band-aid was simply laughable, and although it was a fun part of the film, the logistics of those events just don't work. I also became aware of just how weak a lead character Harry is while watching this film. He doesn't actually achieve anything off his own back. He doesn't train hard, study hard or ever really sacrifice himself. He has genetically inherited skills that he doesn't seem to have any control or understanding of and is constantly told what to do by Hermione and all the Hogwarts staff. Dumbledore and McGonagall seem to have no other purpose in the story than to help Harry justify his place as the star of the story.One thing I will say about the series so far is that Emma Watson and Alan Rickman are both excellent. Admittedly, it would be difficult not to shine when starring alongside Radcliffe and Grint, but they still do a lot to make these films watchable. The heavy-hitting A-listers Oldman, Thompson and Spall are all decent in their roles but are not really tested in this particular film. A slight improvement but still a grotesquely overrated production.",5,0,1,14 April 2020
Bad Teacher," What on earth did I just watch?
","Is this what it's come to? Have we really sunk so low as a society that people are actually entertained by such pointless vulgarity and lethargic writing? This could be a contender for the worst film I've ever seen. Why are people writing and producing stuff like this? I just don't understand. You would have to be a certifiable moron to think this was anything other than a complete waste of 90 minutes.It's a shame to see Cameron Diaz reduced to such appalling roles as this. She's clearly not an elite actor but I don't understand why she sets the bar so low with the jobs she takes. And as for Jason Segel, how this guy makes his way into mainstream movies I will never know. Every time his smug face appears on the screen I want to rip my own eyes out and then douse them in bleach. And if ever there was a case for musicians not trying to become actors, Justin Timberlake emphatically demonstrates it here.Pathetic degenerate garbage, avoid at all costs.",1,0,2,13 April 2020
Mamma Mia!," Great music but... um, yeah.
","Come on now. I know it's a musical and there will be songs and all but seriously, that's virtually all there is. The music takes up so much of the movie that there isn't any time left to tell an actual story. But maybe that's a blessing, because the little bit of 'plot' we are left with is absolutely pathetic and a stain on the resumes of all involved. The whole experience feels like a Meryl Streep mid-life crisis and the karaoke scenes are a complete embarassment. Yes I know this is supposed to be 'a bit of fun' but you could get all the same enjoyment by watching an ABBA concert on youtube and sparing yourself the ridiculous celebrity posturing.",2,1,2,27 June 2020
School of Rock," The only thing more ridiculous than this story is the fact that Jack Black is a paid actor
","I'm sure there are worse actors out there than Jack Black, but it's hard to imagine it while watching him stumble his way through this debacle of a movie. I'm actually quite proud of myself for making it to the end. It's quite an achievement for a supposed comedy film that pushes two hours duration to not have a single funny moment.Black's overacting will probably be my abiding memory of this traumatic experience but let's not forget the one-dimensional characters, paint-by-numbers plot and endless flaws of logic. For a film about rock music we literally see just one song, and it takes over ninety minutes to get there. And Black's horrible character completely hogs the limelight from the kids anyway so what was the point of all that? This is just horrible, everything about it. I will probably have to re-watch The Commitments just to restore my faith in film-making.",1,0,10,2 May 2020
Kick-Ass," A sorely misunderstood masterpiece
","I am somewhat puzzled by all the negative reviews that Kick-Ass has received. I may be completely misinterpreting this movie, but as far as I can see, this is a tongue-in-cheek and refreshingly self-effacing piece of cinema. There is a gentle but respectful mocking of both the comic-book and action movie genres as well as an astute commentary on the gratuitous violence so prevalent in modern films. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just an indulgent infantile fantasy story with zero taste or subtlety.Kick-Ass would rank as one of the most original and well-executed comedies of recent years, featuring an excellent cast and some brilliant one-liners. Chloe Grace Moretz is a show-stopper but Aaron Taylor-Johnson also gives a great performance with a perfect blend of nerdiness, courage and reticence. There have been very few films in recent years with this balance of excitement, ingenuity and self-awareness.",8,1,1,30 April 2020
Back to the Future Part III," Back To The Future bows out in style
","After the unfortunately jumbled sequel, Back To The Future III takes a welcome change of direction. The Old West is a great setting for a new story and while the set and costumes do look a little cheap, this is still a very enjoyable movie with a great soundtrack.Introducing a love interest for Doc Brown was a risky but successful plot development. I've never been a big fan of Mary Steenburgen but her and Christopher Lloyd are very sweet in this film and have convincing on-screen chemistry.By the end of this movie you are definitely ready for it all to end. Many of the scenes are now highly repetitive ('Hey McFly!') and the characters have had all the juice squeezed out of them. The trilogy is wrapped up nicely with Marty's car crash redemption and Doc's happily-ever-after departure. A solid and satisfactory way to end a classic trilogy.",7,2,2,21 April 2020
Dumb and Dumber," Pure slapstick goodness
","As far as goofy comedies go, Dumb and Dumber is something of a classic. There's really not much to say about it other than watch it and enjoy yourself. This is pure comic relief.The film features Jim Carrey at the peak of his powers, ably assisted by his trusted sidekick Jeff Daniels. The jokes come thick and fast with an unapologetic lack of subtlety. The plot is reasonably interesting and props up the humour nicely.The very final scene is one of my favourite comedy moments ever. Such a crude and simple joke and yet so brilliantly executed.",7,0,0,8 April 2020
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A bit too dark, needs a drop of sweetness
","There is a darkness and eeriness to Roald Dahl stories that makes them a perfect match for Tim Burton's style of production. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is particularly sinister and really, this should have been a masterpiece.However, Burton indulges himself a little too much with some strange plot alterations and dubious casting choices. I really don't enjoy Johnny Depp in this role whatsoever and that alone ruins the movie for me. He brings no charm or charisma to the character and instead is just creepy and cloying.Honestly, this could have been great but there is already a very serviceable screen adaptation of this book that features a masterful performance by Gene Wilder. A remake needed to take advantage of improvements in editing, costumes and special effects while preserving the warmth and wonder of the original. For me, Burton fails to achieve this and the whole production just feels self-indulgent.",5,0,1,25 May 2020
The Hangover Part II," Shamelessly squeezing every last drop out of the formula
","I generally despise sequels and Hangover II is a great example of why that is. This is just a complete rewrite of the original with zero artistic integrity. And if you were going to make just one change, surely you would remove the atrocious Mr Chow? But no, Todd Phillips appears to be the only sentient being who actually thinks this character is funny. Even Mike Tyson is dragged back into this mess for no good reason other than to sing out-of-tune at a wedding (why is this funny?) There are a handful of mildly amusing moments, largely thanks to Ed Helms, but overall this is just a lazy and shameless sequel that does nothing but taint the original.",3,1,1,26 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Another solid offering but somewhat rushed and jumbled
","Just like it's predecessor, The Order of The Phoenix is unforgivably short and should definitely have been made into two separate films. Too much of the source material is neglected and we are left with a jumbled frantic mess of confusing plot leaps. The ending is actually quite difficult to follow if you are not well acquainted with the books, and if you are, you would no doubt be heavily disappointed with the telling of this story. The portrayal of Grawp is another huge disappointment that is completely unacceptable given the quality of the CGI throughout the rest of this movie.Despite not being much of a fan of the books, I can certainly feel the frustration of those who cherish this series. I actually think the movies work better for people who haven't read the books and can just take everything at face value without the agony of comparison. It's a shame Peter Jackson wasn't able to get his hands on this series as it could have been so much better. One thing I will say however is that Daniel Radcliffe deserves a lot of praise for his development throughout the series. I found him painful in the first two films but since then he has flourished in the role and has helped me enjoy the series an awful lot more.",6,0,0,14 April 2020
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Two grown-men trying to murder a 10-year old self-development guru
","While the original is rightly considered an all-time classic family film, the sequel is nothing more than a lazy cash-grab. It staggers me that John Hughes could just rewrite the exact same story and think it would be acceptable. The only significant difference from the original is that the main characters become even more slapstick and many scenes are just plain stupid as a result. It's a shame to see great actors like Catherine O'Hara and Joe Pesci reduced to this.Culkin is still very cute and likeable but his character is so unbelievably corny in this movie that it makes some of his scenes painful to watch. Many of his lines feel like they were taken from a cheap self-help book or a fortune cookie. His scenes with Marley in the original were moving and authentic; his scenes with Brenda Fricker aka Pigeon Lady are just forced and contrived. Speaking of Pigeon Lady, surely they could have at least tried to make her resemble an actual homeless person? She looks like a well-fed piano teacher from Surrey.I really wish I hadn't watched this movie; it's such a shame when these dreadful sequels take the gloss off a great film. It's only Culkin who prevents me giving this a basement rating.",3,0,0,13 April 2020
Groundhog Day," Peak Bill Murray
","While I do think many people go overboard with their praise of this movie, Groundhog Day is nevertheless a highly inventive quirky comedy and features one of Bill Murray's best performances. I feel like this could potentially have been a massive flop had anyone other than Murray been cast in the lead role, especially given that his co-star Andie MacDowell is completely devoid of charm in every role she plays. Murray is as dry and biting as ever but still manages to make us fall in love with Phil Connors and feel every inch of his anguish, despair and humility.I do find the underlying premise a bit disconcerting, however. The idea that Connors has to achieve some kind of moral perfection in order to win the heart of a fairly uninteresting woman so that he can be freed from his purgatory is, at best, a little odd and at worst, quite grotesque. I really wish he had broken free from Groundhog Day on his own, with his romantic future still undetermined.Regardless, this is one of those films you just need to watch at least once in your life. A nineties classic, with Bill Murray at his best.",7,0,0,8 April 2020
How to Train Your Dragon," Beautiful film but lacking any real depth
","There seems to be an abundance of terrible animated 'family' films around these days, all characterised by the same flaws; unnecessarily complex storylines, inappropriate adult themes, overwhelming cluttered CGI and sickly self-righteous characters.How To Train Your Dragon is free of most of these issues. It is an imaginative yet straightforward tale, appropriate for all ages and visually impressive without being chaotic. It is also a nice runtime of under 100 minutes, far more digestible than these baffling 2-hour marathons that today's ADHD generation of sugar-filled children have no chance of following.My main problem with animations is that it can be so difficult to connect with the characters. Hiccup is quite bland and cloying, churning out the usual clichés and self-aware nerd humour. Astrid is equally one-dimensional and fails badly as a supposed love interest. The older Vikings are just stereotyped background fodder and don't add any depth to the story. As a result, I couldn't really get into this film and found it quite dull, despite the brilliant animation.",6,0,1,14 April 2020
Total Recall," See you at the party Richter!
","Probably my favourite sci-fi movie. Yes it may not be perfect but it has a level of humour and charm about it that is completely lacking in most modern films in this genre. Schwarzenegger gives arguably his second best performance after the Terminator movies and is supported by a very solid cast, Michael Ironside in particular. The special effects and make-up are impressive and, while there might be a few dated scenes, I would say this was a pretty stellar production for its time.",8,1,1,25 May 2020
Rocky," Needs more boxing and less mumbling
","I have tried so hard to love this movie over the years, hoping to connect to it in the same way that so many others seem to. Sadly, it always leaves me unmoved and a little bored.My main problem with Rocky is that for a near 2-hour film about boxing, there is barely 15 minutes worth of actual fighting. The story crawls slowly and agonisingly towards the main event and then most of it is cut out and what we do see is unrealistic and completely devoid of strategy. The actual boxing choreography is a joke; there's no footwork, defence, feinting, blocking, jabbing, head or body movements. I am no boxing expert but based on the beatings he took, I'm pretty sure Rocky would have literally died had this fight been real.The majority of the movie seems to involve Balboa engaging in rambled conversations, few of which help move the plot forward. Stallone is not strong enough as an actor and Balboa not interesting enough as a character to warrant this. Paulie is quite cliched and forgettable in this movie (although he does develop slowly through the series) and Mickey is a bit forced and melodramatic. Adrian is the only character with any real character development and Talia Shire's performance is comfortably the highlight of this movie.I understand why people love this film so much but for me it is definitely a case of style over substance.",6,0,2,13 April 2020
Rocky III," A little less conversation, a little more action
","Having been underwhelmed by the first Rocky movie and disappointed by the sequel, I was not expecting much from this latest incarnation. However, it's actually quite good and probably my favourite of the series. It doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessors, it's much shorter and there's a lot more action. The fighting scenes are also better; more strategic, more engrossing and more realistic (although Rocky would still die multiple times if this was real).I really enjoyed the inclusion of Mr T and Hulk Hogan. Both are quite cabaret in this film and it really helps lighten everything up. Stallone's acting is as bad as ever but he looks amazing in this movie. Admittedly he looks more like a bodybuilder than a boxer but it's still an incredible sight. Talia Shire isn't as prominent in this film as the others but she is still comfortably the best actor on show. I was kind of glad to see the end of Meredith Burgess however, as his character was becoming increasingly banal and cliched.This is a much more light-hearted offering than the first two movies, and while this may irk hardcore Rocky fans, I found it to be a big positive.",6,0,1,13 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A poor start to the series
","While the series improves as it progress, I found the first two instalments of the Harry Potter franchise quite unenjoyable. Rowling relies heavily on plot band-aids to cover up her mediocre writing and I really cannot think of a more overrated author. I don't even know where to begin regarding the logistical errors of Rowling's work in this particular story. The nonsensical Quidditch scoring system, the abusive Dursleys, Harry's entirely inherited magical abilities, the ridiculous house points scoring system (the ending is just a joke, if I was in Slytherin I would have rioted). These are all bad enough, but it's the overall lack of a cohesive plot that really makes this story so weak. There is no real reason why anything happens, it's merely just a string of random events designed to make the main characters look heroic while the adults gush over them from afar.The casting choices are highly satisfactory at least, particularly Robbie Coltrane and Emma Watson. Daniel Radcliffe, however, is very weak in this first instalment- his wooden acting and excessive cutesiness become tiring very quickly.The special effects are no better, especially considering the budget. The troll is simply laughable, the depiction of Voldemort is atrocious and the flying sequences and Quidditch match are like scenes from a daytime children's TV show. I'm not sure how a 21st century film of this magnitude can contain such uninspiring animations. The sets are very good and I do feel like they bought Hogwarts to life quite accurately, but everything falls apart as soon as any CGI is used.On top of all these criticisms, the film is just way too long. I appreciate the attempt to tell the story comprehensively, but it's very difficult to consume this movie in one sitting, especially for children. Certain scenes could easily have been shortened or excluded without damaging the story in any way.",4,0,2,14 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The best so far, but still deeply flawed
","There is certainly a lot to like about Goblet of Fire. The special effects are significantly better than in the previous films and the performances of the lead characters are vastly improved. Daniel Radcliffe is finally finding his feet as Harry and actually displays some genuine depth and emotion, while Rupert Grint is a lot more convincing and works well with Radcliffe and Watson. I also enjoyed the introduction of the other magic schools, which really freshened up the story by introducing many interesting new characters.However, despite being over two and a half hours long, the film felt extremely rushed, with many elements of the story completely omitted. This should certainly have been extended to a double feature as for non-book readers, the storyline is extremely patchy and confusing and for Potter fanatics, the omission of important scenes is close to sacrilege. Presumably this was a result of rushing to get the film finished in time for the holiday period, which is a huge shame when working with a series as popular as this.",5,0,1,14 April 2020
The Shape of Water," Beauty and the Polyester Fish Costume
","As one of the seemingly few people who didn't like Pan's Labyrinth, I was not surprised to find myself somewhat bored and unimpressed by The Shape of Water. The cinematography and sets felt overly stylized and the dialogue was incredibly corny for a Del Toro film. I always appreciate the attempt to create something majestic and ethereal in this manner, but this was a production that just missed the mark for me.My biggest disappointment was in the creation of Fish-Man, who looked and moved like an am-dram student in a Kick-Ass costume. It was hard to engage with a love story when one of the participants is so farcically presented. I also found that the development of their relationship was unconvincing and incomplete.I appreciate that there may be deeper symbolism and subtleties that I have missed but I believe that a film needs strong characters and an engaging plot above all else and on that count The Shape of Water simply lacks substance, ironic as that may be.",6,2,8,30 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The worst of the series
","Just like its predecessor, Chamber of Secrets is an incoherent mess of a story, loosely woven together with implausible plot leaps. Rowling relies heavily on magic to cover her up her incredibly flimsy writing, randomly inserting illogical events to patch up the jumbled storyline.It didn't seem possible, but Daniel Radcliffe actually manages to produce an even worse display of acting this time round. His performance is so incredibly wooden it's genuinely difficult to watch the scenes he's involved in. Rupert Grint's pantomime acting is equally painful, but it's Christian Coulsen who manages to scoop the accolade for absolute worst actor in this particular movie, with a truly atrocious portrayal of 'Tom Riddle'. Rowling also takes the cake when it comes to atrocious use of cryptology in a novel; the revealing of the Riddle's identity is so laughable it feels like satire.And let's not forget the ridiculous runtime. How are children supposed to stay with this film? So much extraneous drivel that could have been excluded, so many pointless scenes. Thankfully, the series pick up from this point on but I can understand why many people would give up on the Harry Potter franchise after the first two offerings. Both the books and films are extremely weak.",3,0,3,14 April 2020
Die Hard," How is this so popular?
","I've never understood the rampant admiration for this movie. As far as inane American action films go, it's barely even amongst the better ones- let alone a classic. Every single character is a walking cliche, complete with corny Bond villains, arrogant cops, witty black chauffeur and swooning love interest. Bruce Willis is uninteresting and arguably a little irritating while Alan Rickman simply deserves better than this awful writing. The amount of plot armour that Willis is given takes all the suspense out of the film and makes it a rather arduous experience. I have no problem with this genre of movie but Die Hard lacks the atmosphere of The Terminator or the charm of Raiders of The Lost Ark. A very forgettable experience.",3,0,0,10 May 2020
Joker," Joaquin Phoenix, take a bow
","There isn't much else to say; Joker is one of the most absorbing, powerful films ever made. The cinematography is remarkable and the score is just perfectly potent and understated. This is not a thrill-a-minute movie designed to keep you entertained throughout. It is a heavy, all-consuming character study that invites you, with reluctance and fascination, into the mind of a severely disturbed outcast. I don't remember any movie leaving me feeling so emotionally disoriented as I left the cinema.The performance by Joaquin Phoenix is something very special indeed. We spend nearly the full two hours just watching him close up and every second is exhilarating. Rarely, if ever, has a character been so utterly captivating, so desperate and so tragic. His physical acting, from writhing in anguish to dancing with warped delight, is utterly mesmerising. And not once did he ever lay it on too thick. To portray that level of pain and fury without indulging in excess morbidity or melodrama is quite an achievement.Forget where this masterpiece fits into the world of DC comics and Batman movies; Joker is a stand-alone film that deservedly takes its place amongst the greats.",10,5,9,25 October 2019
Hitch," A self-indulgent rom-com rescued by Kevin James
","Hitch is a film about two love stories. One of these stories- between Will Smith and Eva Mendes- is tedious, off-putting and shamelessly unrealistic. Two self-satisfied obnoxious morons with awful careers and awful world views bathing in their own pretentiousness. Every second of interaction between these two vile characters is painful to watch and made worse by the fact that they're probably not even acting very much.The other love story- between Kevin James and Amber Valletta- is much more palatable. It is sweet and sincere and, while it may be a bit far-fetched to imagine these two ever actually getting together, it is a romance you can feel positive about and root for.As a comedy, Hitch has plenty of good moments- largely down to Kevin James' bumbling character and his associated mishaps. The story is reasonably interesting but, like most Hollywood films, it drags on way too long and indulges itself in many unnecessary scenes.",6,0,0,30 April 2020
Arrival," Plenty to like but falls well short of greatness
","While I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from watching Arrival, it didn't really capture my imagination in the way I had hoped. It's a reasonably engrossing watch but it kind of feels like a rehash of various different sci-fi films. There was very little about the plot, the visuals or the dialogue that I haven't seen before in some form or another. There was the alien landing, the media frenzy, the civil unrest, the stern military guys and the wise and noble central character who saves the day. Throw in a boring romance and some lazy stereotypes about China and Russia and you have yourselves a generic Hollywood blockbuster.The one element of the film that stands out is the storyline with Louise and her daughter. These scenes had genuine intrigue and emotion and were nicely incorporated into the main plot. The other big positive about Arrival was the performance by Amy Adams. Her role wasn't particularly challenging but she still offered a level of subtlety and delicacy that is so often lacking in films like this. It was a huge shame that Jeremy Renner was cast alongside her as he was laughably inept by comparison. It was also unfortunate to see Forest Whitaker given such a corny one-dimensional role knowing what he is capable of as an actor.Where the film went wrong was with the communication development between the humans and aliens. I won't go into detail on this as there are plenty of negative reviews that really labour the point, but it was unfeasible that things would progress the way they did. The conversation between Louise and Costello towards the end of the film was laughably corny and by this point I was just wanted it all to end.The alien genre is a difficult beast to tame and very few movies have done it well. Arrival promises a lot early on and was close to pulling it off but was let down badly by some lazy writing and weak characters.",6,2,3,13 April 2020
The Terminal," Good clean fun but a missed opportunity
",The Terminal comes mighty close to being a truly memorable movie but is let down by some unnecessary soppiness and directorial indulgence. Tom Hanks gives Navorski a rather childish persona that is somewhat cloying and arguably a little insulting. Hanks has enough charm to maintain Navorski's likeability but I really feel this was a missed opportunity in character development. The supposed romance between Hanks and Zeta-Jones is pretty farcical and doesn't play out well. The whole charade takes an unnacceptable amount of time and makes the movie laborious towards the end. This is still a very enjoyable wholesome film but it could have been so much more.,7,1,1,20 May 2020
Back to the Future Part II," A flawed but uniquely interesting sequel
","There's no doubt that Back To The Future II is a bit of a mess. The script was far too ambitious and falls apart constantly with endless logistical errors and implausible plot leaps.Despite this, the film is still very enjoyable and unlike any other in its genre. The scenes where Marty returns to 1955 and encounters parts of the original story (including himself) are incredibly creative and great fun to watch.The make-up is somewhat disappointing and Thomas Wilson probably deserved better than to be turned into a bizarre waxwork. Everyone still looks great in 1955 but the 2015 characters are a bit far-fetched and ridiculous, particularly with Michael J Fox playing his entire family.Nevertheless, I have watched this move countless times and never get bored with it. If nothing else, it nicely bridges the gap to the finale and allows us all to be disappointed that we STILL don't have hoverboards.",7,1,1,21 April 2020
Creed II," A grotesque abomination featuring one of the worst lead performances in recent memory
","If ever a film proved how important a good writer is, this was it. Creed (written by Ryan Coogler) was a surprisingly impressive regeneration of the Rocky movies and was generally lauded by critics and Rocky fans alike. Creed II (written by Stallone and Juel Taylor) however, is an absolute disgrace and should be wiped from the Hollywood hard drive.Firstly, there was absolutely no reason to make this movie other than sheer greed. There were no loose ends to tie up and no characters to conclude.The fight scenes, which were pretty good in Creed, regress back to the nonsense we saw in the original Rocky sequels. Hideous choreography and woefully unrealistic sparring sequences. And on top of that we had the commentators spoon-feeding the viewers what they should be feeling about every single exchange.Something that plagued the early Rocky movies was the endless dialogue about nothing. It was little more than pop psychology being vomited onto the screen to be lapped up by head-nodding simpletons. This returned in full-force here and was not helped by the fact that the two main protagonists were the hopeless Tessa Thompson and the inexcusably bland Michael B Jordan.How this guy landed such a huge role is a mystery to me. He was just about acceptable in the first movie where his age and naivety somewhat explained his insipid demeanour. But in this follow-up, which calls on him to step up and carry the film, he falls woefully short. And if the writers thought giving these two no-marks a deaf baby was going to make people resonate with them they were wrong. That was a desperate and pointless attempt at sentimentality and it backfired horribly.I can't express how appalled I am that this was even made, let alone how bad it was. Stallone went out gracefully in Creed and the Rocky character was complete. Yet for some unknown reason, he couldn't help but yank back the scripts and churn out another schmaltzy mess.One of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch.",1,1,2,13 April 2020
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Not bad (for a Woody Allen film)
","This is probably my favourite Woody Allen film so far, or at least the only one I haven't been absolutely repulsed by. It still feels typically self-indulgent, with the impossibly beautiful cast and the rather manicured depiction of Catalonian life. And while it's much less pronounced than in his other works, the pretentious contrived dialogue creeps in a little too often. But despite this, the film is generally quite enjoyable. The cast, Penelope Cruz especially, are predictably mesmerising and I actually quite like the narration- even if it did feel a bit like a rip-off of Amelie. I very nearly switched it off during the opening credits when I saw Allen's name, but it turned out to be a pleasant enough experience.",6,1,1,13 May 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," A visual treat but style definitely trumps substance
","This is one of those films I really wanted to love. I grew up on Roald Dahl and really liked the book, probably one of his most charming stories. However, while I really liked some aspects of the movie, it fell a bit short of being memorable.I will say that the graphics are an absolute treat throughout this film. The stop motion animation is amazing and the sepia tones really work for me. I find that the majority of 21st century animated films are visually overwhelming with far too much happening on the screen. I often feel that the producers are more concerned with showing what they are capable of doing rather than what they should be doing. Fantastic Mr Fox is one of the few exceptions. It is quaint and charming and matches the feel of the book very nicely.Unfortunately, I felt the telling of the story just got a bit messy. It was not close enough to the original and felt unnecessarily complex at times, especially given the target audience. My other big gripe was with the American accents. I understand the draw of big Hollywood stars, but this story really demands well-spoken English actors. Sir Ian McKellen as Mr Fox with Ricky Gervais as the Rat could have been epic! Having said that, George Clooney did a pretty good job and grew on me as the movie went on.Ultimately, I felt this was a beautiful production but one that lacked any real substance. I would still recommend it to anyone based on the remarkable animation but it's not something I'd rush to see again.",6,0,0,13 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," An impressive and satisfactory conclusion to a somewhat flawed film series
","Without doubt the Harry Potter films improved with each offering, culminating in this highly enjoyable finale. The story is wrapped up in style with another visually impressive, well-paced piece of cinema.I have never been a huge fan of the books and struggled through the early films but David Yates took them to a new level and allowed me to really savour the final instalments. The late Alan Rickman's performances will be my abiding memory of the series but I also take my hat off to Daniel Radcliffe who improved dramatically through the series after a very slow start.Would I be in a rush to watch this series again? Not at all. Would I recommend it to others? Just about. A decent adaptation but not without it's flaws.",8,0,0,14 April 2020
Pitch Perfect," Not exactly perfect but gently amusing
","Although I certainly enjoyed some parts of this film, the two leads- Anna Kendrick and Skylar Astin- are just far too obnoxious and self-satisfied for me to really invest in the story. The rest of the cast are a mixed bag, with Adam Devine and Ben Platt giving solid performances and one-trick-pony Rebel Wilson quickly becoming tiresome. I guess if you are a Kendrick or Wilson fan you will probably enjoy this a lot more than I did. Ultimately though, while there are plenty of humorous moments and some enjoyable singing contest scenes, Pitch Perfect is just a little too formulaic and predictable to stick in the memory.",5,0,0,23 April 2020
The Hangover Part III," Chow down on some formulaic drivel
","The one positive of Hangover III is that there was at least some attempt at an original story. Not much of an attempt granted, but still more imaginative than the previous godforsaken sequel. Regardless, this is another dreadful film that further tarnishes the reputation of the perfectly enjoyable original. All the jokes are worn extremely thin and even Ed Helms has become grating by this point. Mr Chow, one of the worst characters I can remember seeing in any film, is given an unacceptable amount of screen time and predictably butchers every second of it. Shambolic garbage, don't waste your time.",3,1,1,26 April 2020
Honey," I hope that Artificial Intelligence will allow me to one day erase this trash from my memory
","One of the most terrible things that has ever had the temerity to place itself in my line of vision. Jessica Alba might be cute and all but she has absolutely zero acting ability and the rest of the cast have about as much screen presence as an airborne virus. The so-called thugs are particularly atrocious and their dialogue is so unbelievably cliche I couldn't tell if this was a parody or not. Honey is similar to Breakin' in how corny it is, but unlike the eighties classic, the dancers in this monstrosity have absolutely zero personality. One of the worst films I've ever seen, people who like this should be put down.",1,0,0,11 May 2020
The Breakfast Club," One of the most overrated films of all time
","It's actually quite difficult to think of a more overrated film than this abomination from John Hughes. My only explanation for all the high ratings is that people over the age of 40 are badly misremembering a piece of their youth that may have seemed edgy and contemporary at the time. In reality it is slow, tedious, directionless and the main characters are highly narcissistic and totally unrelatable.Hughes' films give the impression of a man who was an outcast at school and uses his 'art' as a way of creating some kind of cool childhood he never had. The actors look 25 (except Judd Nelson who could pass for 33) and you never once feel like you're watching actual high school kids. The dialogue is incredibly unrealistic and not one single moment in this film feels authentic. The overacting is relentless with Estevez the worst offender and only Ally Sheedy coming away with any credit.The idea that Hughes gives voice to the oppressed youth of the times is also laughable. This is a bunch of highly privileged middle-class kids getting a first-rate education and doing nothing but complain about it. The fact that a teacher working overtime is the villain of the piece tells you everything you need to know about the deluded infantile fantasy that is John Hughes' view of the world. And it's not just the teacher who is made out to be the bad guy. All their parents are alluded to as oppressive bullies who stifle their children's creativity and personal development, yet all these kids are healthy, well-dressed, educated and living in safe suburbia. This petty rebelliousness is a common theme in Hughes' work, particularly in Ferris Bueller's Day Off- one of the few films I despise more than this.There are also some alarming messages regarding the place of young women in society. Allison is cast as a socially awkward virgin until she is given a makeover by one of the school's pretty girls. Within minutes she has surrendered her entire identity, is dating a jock and set to live happily ever after. Claire ends the day making out with a guy who has verbally abused her all day and done God-knows-what under the table. And let's just ignore the fact that she ends the day kissing a guy she saw literally spit into his own mouth a few hours earlier.And finally, the award for the 'worst attempt at acting stoned of all-time' goes to Emilio Estevez for his rhythmic gymnastics display after a couple of non-inhaled puffs of weed. I dread to think how this guy would respond to cocaine or ecstasy.If this was an obscure indie film that flopped badly I would probably feel bad for the producers and never think of it again. But the amount of acclaim and adoration that people have for this monstrosity is baffling and infuriating in equal measure.",2,3,7,14 April 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Slapstick drowning in self-importance
","The first three quarters of this movie are fairly respectable but we are then treated to one of the worst endings I can remember watching. While Last Crusade is not quite as dire as Temple of Doom, it's certainly not much of an improvement. We see the worst special effects so far in the series- a feature indicative of how sloppy these films have become- and, while there are some funny moments, the jokes are generally far too contrived.Sean Connery's addition is little more than fan service and, while he is moderately amusing at times, him and Ford have zero on-screen chemistry. River Phoenix's inclusion was a little bizarre and he just wasn't convincing as young Jones. The plot is way too similar to Raiders to be interesting, this just feels like a tribute act by comparison.Another weak sequel with an atrociously pretentious ending- possibly one of the most overrated films in recent history.",4,0,2,19 April 2020
Back to the Future," Cinematic perfection
","Not only is Back To The Future my personal favourite film, it would surely rank as one of the best family films of all-time, if not the best. The combination of a wonderfully creative story, perfect casting, great comic delivery and an incredible ending make for an astounding piece of cinema.As with all time-travel stories, there are some serious flaws of logic that you can't help notice (how did they know the lightning would strike at dead-on 11:04 and not in any of the other 59 seconds of that particular minute?). But these glitches are minor and are thoroughly overridden by the exhilarating story.Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox are the heart and soul of this film and these two men turn in performances that will forever be remembered by everyone who loves Back To The Future.",10,1,1,21 April 2020
Dodgeball," If you can dodge a wrench, you can spare 90 minutes for this screwball goodness
",Dodgeball is a well-crafted jocks vs nerds comedy that gently mocks the sports movie genre and ruthlessly mocks the fitness industry. It's not subtle or original and nor does it need to be.Ben Stiller is excellent as the massively over-the-top villain and Vince Vaughn plays off him perfectly. The supporting cast is well constructed and the cameos from Lance Armstrong and Jason Bateman are brilliant. The humour is cutting and relentless without ever becoming coarse or grotesque like a lot of modern comedies.,7,0,0,13 April 2020
