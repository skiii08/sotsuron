Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Very funny ?? Yes if you're from Kazakhstan! THE TRUTH.
","This film 'attempts' to make a Jim Carey 'Dumb and Dumber' Meets Eddie Murphy's 'Coming To America' (both of which are far superior well financed movies with real comedians) and fails terribly. Sacha Cohen has a lot to learn about comedy but don't let him learn at your expense.'The truth' is this films is terrible. It might as well be called Dumb and Dumber 3! The only people laughing in the cinema i watched this in were foreign and presumably from Kazakhstan as i couldn't understand a word they were saying to each other in between laughter. We've all watched an American sitcom and there's programmed laughter every time someone opens their mouth (funny or not). Well that's what this film was like for the foreign minority in the cinema i was in and unfortunately (not being from Kazakhstan) myself and colleagues could not join in. The entire film is an inside joke with nothing for the general public and i'm a huge fan of comedy. I've seen good comedy and bad but this is by far the worst. Sacha Cohen only proves he can be extremely stupid but not funny. If you are English or American and above the age of 5 this film is not for you. Mr Bean and 'Dumb and Dumber' (if you want to laugh at someone stupid!), Laurel & Hardy, Smith & Jones, The Young Ones, Peter Kay, Police Academy, Friends, Frasier, Austin Powers, Scary Movie 1, Will and Grace etc.. are far better and free on UK television! They are not necessarily great for everyone but believe me when i say 'they are better'. In summary: 'Borat is the worst film on the cinema at the moment and should be renamed Prat'",1,16,36,9 November 2006
