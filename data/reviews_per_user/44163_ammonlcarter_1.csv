Ford v Ferrari," Well done
","Thrilling at times and tender in moments. Incredible racing scenes and with great visuals and audio. I'm not a big fan of Matt Damon and he would not have been my first choice for Shelby, but after viewing the film I cannot say that he wasn't the right choice. The acting was spot on and the story was well told. Likely my favorite racing movie of all time. Entertaining and moving",9,2,3,17 November 2019
