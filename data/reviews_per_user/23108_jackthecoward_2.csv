Requiem for a Dream," Painfully beautiful
",Such a great Jared Leto film. But it's a nauseating film - you'll feel sick - it's simply that effective! The musical score is amazing too and great cinematography for its time. Check it out if you haven't already,9,1,1,2 October 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Good fun
","It's a film that's more about fun than thinking or engaging you in story. That was my opinion anyway - perhaps the more you know about the comics, the less impressed you are I'm guessing.",7,2,6,2 October 2018
