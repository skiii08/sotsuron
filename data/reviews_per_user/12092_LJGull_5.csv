Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of my all-time favorites
","Non-stop action from beginning to end, this one will keep you on the edge of your seat and begging for more when it's over. I went to see this one in the theatre when it came out, not thinking it was a movie I really cared to see. I left thinking it was the best movie I'd ever seen...hands down.",10,0,1,9 November 2003
Memento," VERY hard to follow
","Overall, I liked the movie. All the skipping around made it awfully hard to follow, but by the end all the pieces came together. I DO realize this was vital to the storyline, to try and put the viewer in the same scattered frame of mind as the main character. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a short attention span. It's probably a movie you'd have to see more than once to get the full effect.",7,0,3,9 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Surprise! I Liked It
","This type movie really isn't my cup of tea, I'm a lot more interested in westerns, war flicks, prison movies...the standard favorites of the 30-45 yo male demographic. I rented this one based on it's high IMDb ranking, but I really wasn't expecting much. I figured it's high ranking was based mostly on the votes of adolescents who didn't share my taste in movies. But I've got to admit, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I went on to rent 'The Two Towers', and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the next chapter.",7,0,1,9 November 2003
The Elephant Man," A sore disappointment
","Perhaps this movie was ripe with artistic value, and maybe it was meaningful and delivered a strong message. That's all fine and good, nothing wrong with any of that. But for pure entertainment value, I gave this movie a 2...I just wasn't entertained. Call me shallow if you will, but I don't look to Hollywood to teach me the meaning of life or reinforce my moral values. I look to Hollywood to entertain me, and they failed miserably in that aspect with this atrocity.",2,10,131,9 November 2003
The Godfather," A movie deserving of it's IMDB ranking
","While this isn't my favorite movie of all time, it's definitely in my top 10. I've probably seen this movie a half dozen times, but I recently watched it again for the first time in about 15 years. If you haven't seen it lately, it's worth watching again.",9,0,3,9 November 2003
