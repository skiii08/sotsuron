The New World," A whole New World of film-making!
","Terrence Malick's film, The New World,is a cinematic experience like no other. Set in Virginia during the Discovery Age, The New World sends the viewer back in time for a retelling of the story of Native American princess, Pocahontas, and gives a detailed perspective on life for the English Settlers of Jamestown and the Native Americans that encounter them. Colin Farrell, Christian bale, and new-to-the-screen actress Q'Orianka Kilcher lead an outstanding cast as John Smith (Farrell) John Rowlfe (Bale) and Pocahontas (Kilcher). The films cinematography is outstanding, having a subtle, artsy style that truly captures the essence of the story and time period. The costumes are extremely well done and fit the period. Unlike past Pocahontas tales such as Disney's version, Pocahontas, the story is historically accurate and the Native Americans don't speak English, and certainly not through magic as in Disney's story. Overall, The New World is a dramatic, yet fast-paced and compelling tale that is put on the silver screen perfectly.",10,49,99,1 December 2005
