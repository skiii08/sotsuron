Deja Vu," No mistakes, great success.
","Can we change what happens? Would things be different if we knew the future? And if we know it, does the only fact of having that power influence the next moments of our lives? Does it have any sense? The eternal question of the human being. Everything mix up in an unsolved paradox, and represented in this Tony Scott's film. Denzel Washington once again brings life to his character and gives a breath of anxiety in every single scene. Tension gets more and more uncontrollable, and with the running of the seconds, the privilege of being a simple spectator turns in an enormous desire of getting involved in the plot. The details are taken in extremely care. Where it seems there is no reason, for our surprise, there is. And where it seems there is truly a reason..., well, my friends, it's not what you believe it is. The first hour you may think that nonsense takes the control, but don't panic, remember that for every 'why' there is a 'because'. Fast cameras will increase your pulse and give you the feeling of confusion. Doubts plus the thought of having lost several moments will take you to total madness. Exactly the same feeling of our leading man.An ultimate edition quality, even a better direction, crowned by the performances of Val Kilmer and James Caviezel make this film a great Hollywood's piece.Armed yourself with patient and be prepare to tolerate the anxiety. The answers will appear. Give it time,... because in this kind of films Time is the main character.You have to see it, from the beginning to the end (if that is defined). Of course if you think you already saw it, it's just a Deja Vu, because there is no movie like this.",8,1,2,11 January 2007
