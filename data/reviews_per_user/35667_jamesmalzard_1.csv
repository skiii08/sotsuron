The Benchwarmers," If you want to maintain your faith in comedies, do not see this movie!
","*Spoilers*Awful! Everything about it was poorly worked. From the Catastrophic characters to the the woeful writing to the the dodgy directing. This film had a moral; nerds and bullies can get along, like i haven't heard that 1000 times in every other movie of its kind. The protagonist 'Gus' is portrayed as some kind of superhero, while the two dodgy supporting roles just kept up the pathetic nature of the film, and honestly..i did not laugh once. And by the way, the whole pizza hut girl with the video guy....what was that about? what was her motive to get with him? 'wow a creepy guy in a video shop that plays baseball with kids, what a turn on' give me a break, and the character 'Howie' who is afraid of sunlight is completely not needed! This movie should only ever be seen as a demonstration on how NOT to make a comedy.",1,2,3,10 June 2008
