United 93," Nothing New or Different
","If you saw the movie on A&E, Flight 93, there was nothing new or different in this film. Why pay to see this movie when you can see the first one for free? I walked out about a half an hour before the movie ended because I felt like I'd already been there.I did recognize some of the actors from television and commercials. In a movie like this, that can be distracting: David Rasche from 'An Innocent Man' and Polly Adams from a rheumatoid arthritis commercial - 'I know you...' All in all, I was disappointed in the film. I probably should have known there wouldn't or couldn't be anything new. Save your money and see Flight 93 on cable.",2,5,12,25 May 2006
