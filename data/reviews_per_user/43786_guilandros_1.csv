The Blair Witch Project," Ghastly, amateurish and humorous
","Evidently the Blair Witch, (if there is one), has quite an appreciation of film. This may account for the fact that she/he obviously didn't want this lousy piece of trash, as it was mostly what remained of the cast when the film was discovered. Why she wanted to claim the unimaginative, expletive charged, venomous kids who made this film, though, shall forever be a mystery.With all the antagonism between the members of this film's cast/ victims, a reasonable guess as to what happened to them, is that they murdered each other! At least, the publicity spiel is generous enough to tell us that this drivel was filmed by film 'students' and not professionals, and we can blame the film editors for feeling that this cinema verite, has enough interest to inflict upon a naive public (which they obviously believed their audience to be).As an Australian who has been lost in a bush environment myself (and a city Aussie at that), I could not fail to be amused at the amateurishness of this team who would have trouble finding their way out of a supermarket, let alone a supposedly beast harbouring forest.I suppose with many things in life, you get what you pay for and considering the malicious natures of the four victims in the film, they may have gotten what they deserved.",1,1,3,1 April 2002
