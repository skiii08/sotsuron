The Blair Witch Project," Not worthy of the hype or your money.
","I went to this movie expecting to see a scary and suspenseful movie.  I left the movie in disbelief.  How could all of the critics give this movie rave reviews.'THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT AS FRIGHTENING AS A BUG'S LIFE!'I disliked the Haunting also because it wasn't scary, but at least it had some good special effects.  Blair Witch Project has nothing to offer for $8.00.The hype around this movie was that it was original, scary as hell, and didn't rely on effects using your imagination  instead.  Well it wasn't scary (I brought my girlfriend who gets frightened very easily, she even jumped a few times at the Haunting and she said Blair Witch wasn't scary at all), its hard to invoke thoughts of sticks and stone piles and believe this is scary material.After the disappointingly abrupt ending, I walked out of the film feeling cheated out of my money not by the film makers or actors, but by all of the critics that gave praise to this farce.  They, in my opinion should all be given their pink slips.Very, very, very disappointing.",1,2,4,8 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you like Sesame Street and big special effects it's your bag.
","Yes, I succumbed to the hype and put another $10.00 into George Lucas's pocket.  When will we learn, the bigger the hype and special effects, the smaller the script and plot.It's clear, George Lucas is all about money and nothing about Star Wars.  He made it for children so they would see it ten times over and buy millions of dollars in toys.  This movie bluntly shuns all fans of the original installments.The only thing that can save the Star Wars saga now is to get Lucas out and inject some new blood into this once great series.",1,3,6,14 August 1999
