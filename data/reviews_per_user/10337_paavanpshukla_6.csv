Despicable Me 2," Just as fresh as the original one! cant recommend enough
","Despicable me 2 This is probably the first time when a animated series' sequel has surpassed the excellence of the original movie. It was fairly unique as instead of the typical good guy as the main character, they put up a villain as the protagonist (although he ended up good) which made it more refreshing and more fun to watch. Aside from his pointy nose and hilarious accent, we were also invited to spend some time with the extremely adorable and mischievous yellow Minions, who speak almost entirely incomprehensibly in their own unique language. This time around, Gru's no longer a villain. The comedy here works too. The jokes are humorous and most of them work for all ages. Some of them may not be original or repetitive, but they're still able to give you a laugh. And it doesn't hurt that an incredible cast was behind the delivery of the jokes here. Steve Carell was charming as usual and he never fails to impress with his excellent voice portrayal of Gru. The rest of the cast was superb too. I for one,Liked the visual effects in this more than I did of Life of Pi. The sets were also very vibrant and colorful. They're so wonderful that they make the film come to life. Everything is splendid about the setting. They're also very detailed and it's just a treat for the eyes. The animation too is just eye- popping. All the characters' movements are extremely detailed and very smooth. The 3D is more of an optional choice though, but some scenes are especially tailored for 3D as they literally pop out of the screen, especially the end credits. Don't miss that one. High points- Animation, dialogues and end credit Lows- a bit scary for lil ones Verdict- Just as fresh as the original one. I cant recommend enough!  7 on 10",7,1,3,4 July 2013
Gravity," Nearest space experience 99.998% of us will experience!
","This film transports you to space in every cinematic way possible. The visual effects are so brilliantly executed it makes you wonder if they shot part of it in space. The opening shot is 13 min longand not once you think that they are doing it too long. There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso Cuarón's space thriller 'Gravity' possesses and manages to sustain through out the run time! The whole movie is shot in just one room plus some world-class CGI. Which is breathtakingly amazing! The detail to ISS,HST and the earth view is top notch. But Its not just the graphics that keep the movie together. Its Sandy bullock's performance too! Though George Clooney's role is kinda short but still I enjoyed every minute of it. Bullock takes this science fiction thriller and turns it into a very human story. A conflict between the fight to survive and the fight to go on living. Throughout the film it is clear that Stone is distant, almost detached from the other characters. She seems almost indifferent at times to the horror that surrounds her. It becomes clear that she had never come to terms with life after the death of her young daughter. The audience need only look into her eyes to see the cold indifference behind the fear. It is an emotion that is all the stronger when one is in space, and able to see just how inconsequential they are to the grand scale of the world and the universe. The audience, along with Stone, is left to wonder, does it really matter? If you die, the world will continue to spin as if nothing ever happened. The cinematographer is dazzling. I felt as though the cuts were non- existent. I was never aware of an edit, almost as if the entire film consisted of one continuous shot. All the elements of the film came together perfectly to make this movie and to serve the story. But as I said before, Gravity goes far beyond just a simple story. It is an experience.The movie is not entirely dependent on CGI and Sandy B, But writing is also its strong part! So is the background score. Sometimes the way it transits from the heavy heartbeats to silence.Just perfect! The dialogs are very good too!There are times when you think you can predict the story but I bet you cant! I would recommend this movie for everyone! Even if it's a 10 yr old..I am sure they too will enjoy mind blowing effects! Gravity is a sure-shot Oscar winner for Best film, Best actress, Best background score and Best director. I really really hope that Clooney too gets something for his supporting role. Maybe for best editing too! A hard 10 on 10!",10,4,7,14 October 2013
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," one time watch. Paan Singh Tomar was Better. 6.5 on 10
","The movie begins in 1960 with Milkha's failed attempt at securing a medal during the Rome Olympics. Despondent, he tries to withdraw from a government-orchestrated race in Pakistan. One of the organizers can't comprehend why Milkha would quit, but the runner's coach explains (complete with sorrowful music) that the young man has personal reasons. Naturally, the government official asks for further explanation. And, boy, does he get an answer. Some of the stories offer a bit of comedy, a chance to stage a requisite Bollywood musical number or offer some insight into Milkha's personality. There is a sweet subplot involving the beloved sister that raised him and some lively comic relief from his early days in the military. The movie also spotlights the moment Milkha first discovered competitive running. The Movie is very very long3 hours 10 mins? I could have done a better editing job than PS Bharthi. Screenplay is amazingly done. Especially the track running part..the low cam going around the track looks stunning! The film could have been better if the love story part would have been skipped. I have read a ton of articles on Milkha Singh and not one of them has anything to say with reference to the Australian girl or Sonam kapoor part. Bollywood masala I guess.What I didn't like is that the movie ended with Pakistan President honoring him with the name 'Flying Sikh'It should have been Milhka's defeat at Olympics. Another silly attempt to end a Hindi movie on a high.I didn't like this movie as much as I liked Pan Singh Tomar. It was a low budget film but still was better than BMB. BMB would have been a better movie if it was rounded off in 2 hours and the love story part was skipped. Shitty CGI at some places. There would be calls to send this to Oscars but if Pan Singh Tomar wasn't worth it,this sure in hell isn't either.I would rate it no more than 6.5. If you haven't seen PST, watch that first!",6,5,17,11 July 2013
Man of Steel," The 2 reasons I went to watch the movie were Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan, That's it! Not at all what I expected from the makers of 300 and Batman
","The story falls into two halves and sometimes feels at odds with each other in its attempt to connect the two. The first half standing as a origin story heavily rooted in science fiction. We see the final days of a fully realized Krypton, as Jor-El (Russell Crowe) fends off fascist General Zod's rebellion and places the last hope for the Krypton's existence in the hands of his infant son, Kal-El. Once on Earth, the story follows Clark Kent, Earth's surrogate son and would-be superhero Messiah, as he journeys to find the hidden answers to why he was placed on our planet. His childhood is relived through a series of flashbacks triggered by images Clark witnesses around him, which interrupted the movie flow a lot The second half is a punch-heavy parade of action as Snyder digs deep into what he knows best, but in this case its a heavy overdose and u feel like punching Snyder. Meanwhile you learn vital things, like what the 'S' on the Superman costume stands for. I thought the editing was horrible! I thought a lot of the CGI effects were too cartoon like. They really have to start to find tech wizards who understand the laws of physics, and don't create every scene like it's a damn video game. Video game...reality. Video game...reality. This is the mantra they should flash in front of these tech guys as they're creating. I still think Jurassic Park to this day has some of the best CGI ever done on a film. Where are those people? HIRE THEM! At a point of time you would think that MOS was made just to support the drowing Justice League franchisee. Also, General Zod's inner costume seems to be a rip off from one of the Spider Man villains Now,The positives of the film,Wonderful fight scenes and special effects. That's it. Also, the underwear is actually a UNDER- wear now! :P3 for CGI,2 for action and half for the witty dialogues. 5.5 on 10!",5,1,3,16 June 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," As much as I liked the film on technicality , I think it wasn't enough to keep me stuck to my seat.
","The second Hobbit film connects you better to the characters than the first in an entertaining ride with more danger, excitement, and humor. The action is well done, and the 3D adds to it, especially in the 'whitewater rafting' scene which also seems like a water park ride! That part and the whole movie has good editing. In this one, two of the non- King dwarfs' presence is stronger (Balin and Kili). The she-elf warrior Tauriel and what comes with her works, adding some heart to the film. One could argue that Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, when complete, will set up the LotR film trilogy far better than Tolkien's simple children's book sets up the literary LotR. (The change in tone from children's book to grand epic is VERY pronounced, even grating for those who try to read The Hobbit after finishing LotR.) Incidentally, Jackson's prequel trilogy apparently will not spoil the LotR trilogy the way the Star Wars prequels give away important plot points of the original movies. When finished, Jackson's six Middle-earth movies can be profitably watched in sequence of internal chronology. Gandalf didn't have much screen presence this time. Its the Elves leaded by Legolas that bring smartness to the film and Tauriel is a scene stealer. In the end the Dwarfs, Gandalf, Elves, Orcs, Smaug were thrown to different places so they have to get together for 'There and Back Again'. 'Arkenstone' and 'Black arrow' will have much to play in the grand finale. Jackson has also given us a smoldering elfin heroine, Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), whose skill with a bow and arrow matches that of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games. Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien may like sitting through a 169 minute film,but I didn't! this easily could have been trimmed by at least 50 minutes. Yes,Its long, VERY LONG. Coming to the end part,I thought that the dragon will be killed. At least I hoped so but no! The last a few sequences are fun. As much as I liked the film on technicality , I think it wasn't enough to keep me stuck to my seat. I would give this one 6.75 on 10.

The Wolf of Wall Street," fast-paced, though exceedingly dark comedy about the ruthlessness of the highly competitive stockbroker business
","In his fifth collaboration with Martin Scorsese, Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jordan Belfort, a Long Island stock wizard, whose brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont swindles a multitude of investors in the late 1980's. Based on Belfort's own memoirs, 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a fast- paced, though exceedingly dark comedy about the ruthlessness of the highly competitive stockbroker business.A film panned by most critics, but in my opinion,its fantastic! In this role, DiCaprio plays the high-roller wannabe Belfort with a manic verve and exhaustive energy. It's hard to imagine how he, Scorsese and co-star Jonah Hill kept up the pace. I have always been a huge fan of DiCaprio. In reality, his performance was the only good thing about 'Titanic', a film I loathed. How anyone can enjoy watching a disaster in which 1500 plus humans drown is beyond me, but I digress. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a gift to DiCaprio --- allowing him to be as outrageous as necessary. Equally addicted and addictive is Hill, portraying the whiny, paranoid wingman, Azoff. This would be a plum role for anyone but I'm not sure anyone except Hill could have jumped off the screen and made Azoff his own as well as Hill. Both DiCaprio and Hill would be in line for Oscars! First half of the movie will pass by like bullets from a M16. Last 25 minutes in the second half might seem a bit boring and slow. But that's okay because the rest of the movie is so fast paced that when it comes to normal your brain may think that the last part is slow,but its not! It is just normal paced! The language of the movie might seem a but over the line for some since it averages 2 F bombs a minute.Good- The dialogues, editing , Leo's acting Bad- (some)sequences seem similar to The boiler room. Overall- 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is infectiously entertaining. It is probably the funniest movie I have seen all year with witty dialogue, over the top characters, and filled with energy that bleeds off the screen. Between all the fun however, there is also a story about addiction and how it can cause a downward spiral in your life whether it be drugs, money, or power.",9,2,9,3 January 2014
