Scarface," One of the best MOVIES of all time
","Scarface has got to be in my top ten movies of all time i think you should too! but honestly speaking who in their right state of mind would not love this fantastic movie.And people who doesn't want leopard car of there own. I think that this movie should be at the top of every single list of movie rating websites there are.My favorite scene is were Tony plants his face in the mountain of cocaine on his desk just before the shoot out at the end of this movie.But its sad to see tony killed at the end of the movie, it would have been good to see a sequel. Just to add at the beginning of the movie where tony's friend who gets chain sawed.why why did he have to get killed by a chain saw a simple bullet would have been enough I think they went over bored with the kill with chain saw scene. Anyway peoples thats all from me your truly DANI J",9,0,2,28 August 2008
