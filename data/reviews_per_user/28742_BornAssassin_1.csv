The Avengers," Schweeeeeeeeeeeeet !!
","I had absolutely no hope of this one making it big. The second I took my seat, boy was I proved wrong by many a mile! There's a reason this is only the second super hero movie in the top 250. Coz its worth it. Period.I was absolutely glued right from the first minute. It was an awesome mixture of high-end action, drama, suspense, thrill, humor and love! OK maybe not love. Who would want that in a super hero movie anyway?Iron Man was at his brutal best whether it was tactics, word play, narcissism or just plain old explosive action. He just did not disappoint! If you thought Iron Man only did solo, you are in for a surprise.I thought Hawkeye and the Black Widow were going to be just another pair of dummies. NOT! They are as much a part of the story as the rest of them. Be prepared for some of their cool moves. Man, does Scarlett look stunning when she is beating the hell out of the bad guys. Hawkeye might have done way better with a gun, but what the hell. To each his own! Thor and Cap. America, the demigod and the strategist, with the awessssome weapon and shield combo, totally kicked butt(ask Loki's horde)! Perhaps, there was little the captain could do with just his shield.And the best for the last. For those who had lost all hopes of Hulk ever entertaining them, this one changes it all. He is now my favorite today! What raw madness (ask Loki)!! This time Hulk gives it all with a pinch of humor that we have missed in the previous two movies.The first half was built around bringing all the super-heroes together and setting up the story line without deviating from the end plot. The second half just blows you away. Joss Whedon seems to have become a master artist when it comes to super cool dudes. He's given each of the good guys an equal say in the movie with none in particular ruling the show.In the end the 2 and a half hours of non-stop fun seemed to be way less and I was left craving for more :( . This summer is gonna be really hot folks and the Avengers just got the party started! Hoo-haa! Go watch it!",9,5,11,30 April 2012
