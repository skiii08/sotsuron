The Departed," This is The Departed
","This is not a typical remake, this is a giant created by Martin with a rib. This is Martin's best gangster film, eliminating the excessive love and religious meaning of the original version, which is the most realistic sociology. Do n't struggle with the Hong Kong version of poetry and destiny. Martin 's compilation of the night in Boston is not only destiny but also life. This is the perfect balance of Martin 's personal characteristics and business factors. This is The Departed",9,0,0,23 April 2020
Psycho," God made

There Will Be Blood," One person, one generation
","In fact, this kind of simple interpersonal communication is also extremely difficult. Starring Daniel Day-Lewis said many times in an interview that it is difficult to describe a role clearly.

Joker," Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar
","I gave 9 points. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar. The performance is too emotional. It expresses pain with an uncontrollable giggling. The film is very different from most previous superhero movies, with no special effects, no spectacles, or even too many action scenes. But in a slightly retro way, tell why the clown became that clown. In fact, it is a very serious film, including paying attention to social issues. The movie is kind of evil and will make you feel a little sympathy for this clown. In addition, this film should not be sequel and derivative, because it is still too real, if the character is re-comicized, it will no longer be him.",9,0,1,15 March 2020

This conjecture is shocking enough, but the depth of 'The Matrix' does not stop there, it also raises new questions on this basis:
Will you choose blue pills or red pills?
Is it to choose a beautiful illusion or a cruel reality?

On one side is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person.
Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is just a dream.
