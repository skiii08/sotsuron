The Sound of Music," One Of The Great Classics
","This has to be one of the most-loved (along with The Wizard Of Oz) films ever made. I saw it when it was originally released at one of the big downtown Chicago movie palaces which sadly, do not exist anymore. I remember still, the excitement of the justly-famous opening sequence, with that gorgeous Austrian scenery, exploding on the big screen with beautiful color and sound. The cast of this joyous musical was letter-perfect, and the film is timeless. I last saw this on a big screen a few years ago at one of the Grant Park 'Movies In The Park', where an appreciative audience sang along with the songs (although this was NOT the sing-along version) and applauded at the conclusion of various songs and scenes. It always astonishes me when I hear that some critics dislike this film. I love it, and have also had the privilege of seeing the live stage show back in 1962, as well as the recent live television adaptation. The Sound Of Music is a story which should appeal to old and young alike.",Null,2,8,7 December 2013
Citizen Kane," Dull and Boring
","I have read all the reviews of this film, praising it to the heavens, calling it the greatest film of all-time. However, I could barely sit through this tiring story with it's dull characters and enigmatic ending. The fact that it had beautiful photography does not make it a great film. I have had more enjoyment watching a Monogram programmer, with all it's static photography and stock music score. At least some of those films filled their time slots with something lively, even though it would be considered illogical or contrived. There must be a reason some people revere this film. Something I just don't get. I can think of hundreds of other titles that could vie for 'The greatest film of all-time.' Just not this one.",Null,1,2,18 September 2011
Midnight in Paris," Magical
","This is a film which I will not tell you much about, storywise, because you need to be surprised when you see it, as I was. On a cold winter day I grabbed a few dvds from the local bookmobile and this is one of them. Figuring if Woody Allen' name is on something, I probably won't hate it. Au Contraire! I loved it! This film starts out with a picture-post card view of Paris and the film warms up from there. Mr. Allen shows why he is one of our finest filmmakers. In an interview, he says that when starting out, he just had the title with no story to go with it. What a neat story he concocted! I'd like to tell you more, but that would only spoil the fun for you. See this feel-good movie and see if you don't, well, just feel good by the time it is over.",10,3,5,17 January 2013
The Artist," Sublime
","'The Artist' is a true cinematic achievement. In this day and age of CGI effects, color, 3-D and wide screen, here is a film done for all practical purposes, like a film made in 1928. This is so well-made it hard to know where to begin. The music score has the sound of an actual Vitaphone score from the period. In particular, some of the score reminded me of 'The Jazz Singer'. The narrow-screen aspect and evocative black-and-white photography added to the vintage atmosphere the makers were trying to convey. The players are all excellent, and wow! Can the two leads dance? Watch them! It took me about a month to see this because it did not play at all in Chicago for the first month of it's limited release. At the end of the screening, the audience actually applauded. Something I haven't seen in a long time. The appreciation by the audience made me think that if a contemporary audience can enjoy this, they may not avoid some of the other classic silent films that are still available to be enjoyed. So 'The Artist', great film that it is on it's own could serve as a trailer for those uninitiated to the joys of the silent classics.",10,12,21,2 January 2012
Dark Shadows," OK if you haven't seen the older versions
","I am a huge fan of the old Dark Shadows shows. I liked the old series, bloopers and all. I liked the films House of Dark Shadows and to a lesser degree Night of Dark Shadows. I liked the 1991 revival series of Dark Shadows. This new Tim Burton/Johnny Depp version has some good elements in it, like the costumes, soundtrack and special effects, but the problem here lies in the written word. The script relies too much on gags, some funny and some rather lame. The basic characters are mostly here with the exception of the melding of Maggie Evans into Victoria Winters, and the actor playing Willie Loomis does a better job with the character than did the one from the 1991 revival, who chose (or was directed) to play the role as a half-wit.(The one element I disliked about the revival). The 1970s music, cars, costumes and hairdos are spot-on and add to the comfy 1970s feel of the piece. The climax is all special effects and one 'revelation' of the plot is so absurdly done here that it is (unintentionally) laughable. In all, I would say that this film may appeal more to those who never saw any of the original versions of this than the fans of them. I didn't hate this film, I just didn't love it either.",5,92,158,11 May 2012
The Great Gatsby," Better Than I Expected
","Okay, I am one of those who, when I found out who was doing this version of the famous Fitzgerald story, was prepared to hate it. Hip-hop music in a 1920s story? The director from Moulin Rouge!? I was wrong. This is a good version of the oft-filmed story. Leonardo DiCaprio, never one of my favorites, does pretty well here as Gatsby. The script is very much like that written for the 1974 version, which is my favorite. The photography glistens and I didn't mind the hip-hop music too much! The running time is exactly the same as the 1974 version, and the period details are pretty well done, outside of the fact that Gatsby's beautiful car is about ten years too young for the 1920s. An infamous misspelling of 'Ziegfeld', noticeable in the first trailer, has been thankfully corrected for the actual release. I have always been a fan of the 1974 Paramount filming of this story, but I do appreciate the workmanship and the quality of this latest version.",Null,0,2,2 November 2013
