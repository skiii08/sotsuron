The Blair Witch Project," I don't know!
","I would have to say, that the Blair Witch Project would be a freaky movie, and I would be have been a bit more frightened, if, it was real like so many people have said. I went in knowing it could be, and it might not be a true story.  No one knew from certain. I just have to say that anyone out in the middle of nowhere for 3 or 4 days and with video equipment and DAT equipment would not be taping the things that happened to them in a life or death situation.  Who would run outside of a tent with a light to show a psycho where they where.  Maybe the first night.  Or run into the grass with lights on the cameras and live to see the next day. Plus who goes so unprepared, what, does no one own a cell phone, or take a bit more food just incase?Heather Donahue played a good over controlling idiot.  She made me want to grab that camera and shove it down her throat.  Maybe that's what she was aiming for in this film.Bottom line......if it was real, it could have had a more bite but since it was a myth and was a bit stupid with reality, I wasn't as thrilled about it. See, if it was real I wouldn't cheer on the killer(s) as much.",1,0,2,11 August 1999
