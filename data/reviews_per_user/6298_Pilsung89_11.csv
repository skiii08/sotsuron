The Avengers," This is how you make a superhero movie
","The Avengers is one of the better movies I have seen come out in a while. It had good characters, good directing, great action scenes, and a good story.Never before have I seen Hollywood produce several movies, all intending to hype and lead up to a team-up movie. That's what happened here. The Incredible Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man were all clearly made with this intention of eventually making a grand collaboration movie that featured the stars of each movie. This was a very risky move, but I do believe it paid off.The story mainly follows the events that bring the Avengers together. Thor's brother, Loki, has come to Earth to claim a very object for an alien race and let them take over Earth in exchange for him becoming the new ruler. Of course, the previously mentioned superheroes come together one at a time in a bid to prevent this from ultimately happening.Somewhat cliché story, but the chemistry between the characters and the action is where it's at. Not only to all of the main stars do well in their roles, but they do a very good job interacting with each in ways that fit their personality. Tony Stark and Captain America clash over their conflicting virtues and lifestyles, everyone feels a bit wary of the Hulk because of how his powers work, and so on.And the action scenes are downright incredible. This is a shining example of how one creates epic battles surrounding superheroes. The action scenes are grand, awesome, brutal, and entertaining as hell to watch. They are chaotic but you are always able to see clearly what is going on. Many action moves that create such massive battles just make cluttered messes that make it hard to see what is going on. Here, all the characters can be distinguished and they fight using their abilities to their advantages.This movie is not for everyone. If you're a person that is not really into the comic book movies or the superhero flicks, this won't change your mind. It is a comic book adaptation and does not attempt to hide that fact, with the characters all wearing their colorful uniforms and such. Plus the story, while good, is rather cliché and typical of a superhero style plot. But if you are a fan of superhero films, action films, or comic book movies, this is an absolute must to watch. You will not be disappointed.",8,2,6,23 June 2012
The Expendables," A great action flick that pays tribute to older style action movies
","The Expendables is a movie featuring an ensemble cast of action stars designed in a fashion similar to the old action movies of the 80's and 90's. For what it is, it's an amazing action movie with a great cast that includes the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Jason Stathom, Jet Li, Randy Couture, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, and more. The plot is nothing too amazing, but it's good enough and follows a formula similar to the movies it pays tribute to. Basically, Sylvester Stallone plays Barney Ross, the leader of a mercenary group called the expendables that do dangerous mission for money. After being contracted to assassinate the dictator of a small republic, Barney deems the mission suicidal at first but has a change of heart when an innocent's life is at stake. It's the typical story of being the good guy, and blowing stuff up to stop the bad guy. Except it features an awesome ensemble cast. This movie has it all in terms of fights. There are knife fights, gun fights, hand-to-hand fights, and explosions all over the place. The story is typical but the action is top notch, a true tribute to the older action films and a true delight for any action fan. The action is fast-paced, brutal, violent, and very well choreographed.The main shortcoming the film has, though, is it's lack of attention to many of it's cast member. It has a lot of famous and talented action stars, but sadly many are downplayed. Sylvester Stallone and Jason Stathom receive most of the attention as they are in more action scenes and more scenes in general. They also receive the most character development. And Jet Li fans might be a bit disappointed as his highlight moment of the film actually makes him look kind of weak. The other members are simply underused. It's kind of sad because this is such a great cast that was recruited, and most of them could have been used a lot more.As it stands though, The Expendables is an amazing action film that is a must see for die hard action fans. Check your brain at the door and simply enjoy all the ensuing violence.",8,1,5,23 June 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Decent third installment
","It's year three at Hogwarts for Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. Some may wonder how the trio has grown so much since the last movie. It's simple. While Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban are only one year apart in the story, the movies were filmed two years apart. In storyline the three kids are 13 years old.The acting is good, but not as good as the first two films. I think Emma Watson's acting in this one is somewhat rusty. Daniel Radcliffe also has a few rough spots. Maybe it's an age conflict or something. They're playing characters younger than themselves in the teen range. I will be fair and say they both have some good highlights in the film. Rupert Grint managed to keep his character well portrayed the best. Professor Dumbledore is being played by a new actor, since Richard Harris died after the second film. Whether the new actor is better or worse is really up to the viewer. I don't see much difference. Alan Rickman is doing a terrific job as the harsh professor Severus Snape, whose character is becoming more important.This installment is slightly awkward and can be confusing if you don't pay close attention. There are three new characters important to Harry's past: The new defense against the dark arts teacher(RJ Lupin), Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew. There's also the introduction of more creatures, like werewolves and Hippogryphs. The plot is very confusing, so I'll only mention the easy parts. Sirius Black is a convicted murderer who has escaped from Azkaban, and it's believed he wants to destroy Harry Potter and revive Voldemort. Dementors, the creatures who guard Azkaban, are searching everywhere, and are for some reason drawn to Harry. Eventually Harry comes to believe that Sirius betrayed his parents, and only when the three new characters previously mentioned are brought together, does Harry learn the truth.Harry, Hermione, and Ron are definitely growing up and maturing in this third installment. You'll see the best-friend relationship between Hermione and Harry get a little stronger. Whenever Harry is in trouble or gets hurt, Hermione is right there with him. Whenever he passes out, he wakes up and Hermione is sitting next to him, wanting to know if he's all right. At one point she holds Harry and tells Siruis if he wants to kill Harry he'll have kill Hermione and Ron as well. You'll also see really clear evidence that Hermione and Ron like each other. There's a shot where they briefly hold hands and get embarrassed, and a scene where Hermione asks if they should move closer while observing a haunted building. This movie also introduces traveling back in time, and this is the first movie where Harry casts a spell that shows just how great his powers can be. A pretty good movie for the series, but pay attention or you may be confused.",8,0,1,17 August 2007
The Little Mermaid," A definite Disney classic for the ages
","This movie is a classic. Everything about it is great. The story is interesting, the characters are nicely developed, the animation looks wonderful, the directing is good, the music is enjoyable, and the acting is great. It's easy to see how the movie revived interest in Disney animation at the time. And this is from a guy's perspective.The story is about the mermaid named Ariel who is the daughter of King Triton, ruler of the ocean. Ariel is intrigued with the human world but Triton has forbidden contact with the surface. Eventually Ariel makes a deal with a sea-witch to become human, unaware of the real price she has to pay. That's the main idea of the plot without giving too much away.The movie may be considered girly but that doesn't stop me from loving it. Ariel is one of my favorite Disney characters. She actually has a similar yet different personality than other Disney females of the time. Like others, she's interested in what she's not supposed to have. However, unlike others, she's not sour on guys. The movie is just plain awesome, plain and simple. If you've never seen it, Look it up.",10,2,2,17 February 2010
Stardust," Very entertaining and enjoyable movie
","Stardust is a wonderful, wonderful movie that I was privileged to see when it came out in theaters. I was a little skeptical at first because of the title, but my mind changed about 2 minutes into the film. The story is great, the acting is great, and the movie is put together very well.The main story revolves around Tristan, a young man who lives in a village that borders a magical kingdom called Stormhold. When he sees a falling star, he tells the woman of his dreams that he will travel and retrieve the star if she will marry him. When he travels out for the star, he isn't fully aware of what kind of realm Stormhold is. When he reaches the fallen star, it turns out to be a woman by the name of Yvaine. Throughout the movie, many dangers beset them, including a group of witches who also seek to capture fallen stars.Amazingly the plot is not really predictable, which is rare with this year's movies. There are many elements that twist the story up a little bit throughout the movie, and for the most part they all fit very well into the setting and genre. There's a nice blend of drama, comedy, and action throughout the whole film. The acting is pretty good as well. Charlie Cox does well as Tristan, and you can see his character slowly mature and evolve as the story moves along. Claire Danes acts well and looks absolutely gorgeous as Yvaine, the fallen star. Michelle Phieffer also gives an amazing performance as the head witch after Yvaine.One thing to beware of and consider before letting your kids see this movie, though, is the tendency of violence as well as references to violence. There are several stabbings and murders in the movie, and there is constant reference to cutting out and eating the heart of a star(Yvaine). there are some sword fights as well. The overall tone of violence is not really strong, but something to think about.I give this movie a 9/10. This is a great fantasy movie that is not very predictable and has many interesting elements to it.",9,2,2,15 April 2008
Up," Why is this movie so popular?
","I don't understand why this movie is so popular. I really don't. I find it to be an average animated flick. Nothing stands out to me or really appeals to me in the movie. I don't the characters very interesting or memorable. The story is not played out very well at all. the voice acting is good, but nothing special. There were actually quite a few times the characters only annoyed me. I'm not calling the movie bad, but in no way do I consider it amazing. It's just very average to me, on both an entertainment scale and a cinematic scale. this definitely does not compare to animated classics such as The Lion King or Aladdin. It's definitely suitable for young children, though and they will probably enjoy watching it. So if you're looking for a family film to watch with the kids, this movie is for you.",5,6,13,8 November 2009
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great start to a wonderful series
","For years I refused to watch the Harry Potter movies, thinking that I would not like the idea of young witches and wizards. However, after seeing this first movie I immediately came to love the series. Even though it's a PG/PG-13 series, it's terrific. I have seen all the Harry Potter movies out so far, and The Sorceror's Stone is a terrific beginning to the series.The acting and the atmosphere here is amazing. The whole cast does a wonderful job, and it looks surprisingly realistic for a magic movie. Daniel Radcliffe does a good job as Harry Potter, changing his character as is appropriate throughout the movie. Rupert Grint is good, not to mention hilarious, as Potter's best friend, Ron Weasley. Personally I love Emma Watson's performance as the bossy, clever, book-loving Hermione Granger the best. She doesn't portray Hermione as a complete bossy jerk, but more of a insecure girl who loves to prove herself, and deep down has good intentions and a good heart. Other notable performances are Maggie Smith as professor McGonnagell and Alan Rickman as the somewhat scary, dark professor Snape.I really love how this movie starts off the series. Since it's about young kids learning magic at a school, I didn't know what to expect. The kids did not just sit and learn about philosophy, but they do not turn out to be automatic experts, either. Too often in series people just learning something quickly and suddenly know everything there is to know. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are like average first-year students, each showing particular strengths in different subjects. There is some good action in the movie: trolls attacking the school, sports involving flying on a broomstick, and a few good spells.For those who don't know. Harry Potter is an average kid living with his mean, abusive aunt and uncle when he is enrolled in Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. His aunt and uncle disapprove of magic, so he is rescued by Hagrid, keeper of Hogwarts. At Hogwarts he befriends two other students, Ron and Hermione. Throughout the movie Harry discovers what really happened to his parents, what it's like to have friends, and what courage is. At the same time he develops a feud with a cocky first-year student, Malfoy, and tries to keep the school safe from an evil he feels only he, Ron, and Hermione understand. Harry and Ron are close friends from the start of the year at Hogwarts, because they talk on the train. Hermione does not immediately jump in. Overtime she is drawn to them more and wants to be with them more.Get this movie if you can, because it's awesome. I give it a 9/10. I give it only a nine because it still has some of the rough spots natural to first installment: Confusion, lot's of time spent explaining things, less action. However, it had quite a bit of action for a first-part of a series.",9,0,1,16 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Leave childhood behind forever
","It's year four at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weaseley. In the third movie, they were showing signs of leaving childhood. In this fourth film, childhood is completely left behind and our trio of young heroes enter the world of teen-hood, with no turning back.The acting is better than Prisoner of Azkaban, especially from Emma Watson. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson all do exceptionally well in transforming their characters from the young children in the first two films, to maturing teenagers. That transition was sort of rusty in Prisoner of Azkaban. Alan Rickman continues his great performance as Severus Snape. Having seen Rickman in other movies, I know that only he can portray professor Snape in that harsh, mean, but actually caring way. Sirius Black has a brief appearance. Peter Pettigrew also returns to help revive he-who-must-not-be-named. Yet another defense against the dark arts teacher comes to town as well. They seem to have trouble keeping dark arts defense teachers. By this film Harry, Hermione, and Ron treat the world of magic like a normal place completely.Heres the plot: Hogwarts this year is hosting the triwizard tournament, a competition where 3 students, each from a different magic school, compete in a series of magical contests. Due to the complexity and very dangerous nature the events often come with, the ministry has decided only students 17 and older can enter their name for the tournament. However, despite the best magical barriers protecting the Goblet of fire, Harry's name appears and he becomes a contestant. Even though he didn't enter his name, and none of the professors want to put him in danger, the rules bind him to compete. Now he must compete against three other wizards, all older and therefore better trained, in a series of dangerous tasks. Through these tasks Harry resorts to nerve, cunning, and courage to succeed and survive. MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!! In the final event, Harry and Cedric Diggory, another competitor, are lured to a trap from dark followers, and Cedric is murdered as sacrifice to bring Voldermort to full health, and the dark lord returns, with Harry barely escaping thanks to his parents. END MAJOR SPOILER!!! The subplots show how Harry, Ron, and Hermione are growing up. Harry and Ron actually have their first real fight. This is because Ron thinks Harry used magic to place his own name in the Goblet of fire, leading to a temporary silent period between the two. The eventual spark of love to come between Ron and Hermione becomes more evident when Ron is jealous Hermione is asked by another boy from a another school to a dance. It clearly becomes evident how much Hermione cares for Harry as a friend as well, without there being romance. It's clear in two scenes: When Hermione hugs Harry before the first event, obviously afraid for him. Also when Hermione talks to Harry after the second event. Hermione is now my favorite character, and I love her friendship and loyalty with Harry. She's always by his side, even when Ron is mad at him.I really enjoyed this film. Emma Watson delivers a much better performance than in Prisoner of Azkaban. She's one of my favorite actresses. There's plenty of drama and action. Just be ready. They're not kids anymore. They're teenagers with teenage problems and attitudes. I give this a 10/10.",10,0,1,17 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Perfect second installment to the Series
","It's the second installment to the Harry Potter series, and it's an excellent follow-up of The Sorceror's Stone. The Chamber Of Secrets sees some evolving elements of the series. There is also plenty of action in this one, and the acting is even better than the first.It's the second year at Hogwarts for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and things aren't getting calm at all following last year. They're just getting more exciting. Harry Potter has definitely changed. He's wiser, less reactive to everything, and sees Hogwarts as his only home. Daniel Radcliffe does well bringing the new version of his character to life. Rupert Grint acts just the same, as his character is the same. Ron is the same clumsy wizard who likes to panic. Hermione has evolved the most. She's not nearly as bossy or rude, although she's still the most willing to study and learn of the trio. Emma Watson continues her terrific acting as she makes this new Hermione clearly evident. The rest of the cast was terrific as well. Jason Issacs did well as Lucius Malfoy. I can tell Lucius is evil. In movies, guys with long blond hair are always evil.The plot is as follows: Harry receives warnings not to return to Hogwarts. After Ron and his brothers rescue Harry from his still rather rude and mean uncle, aunt, and cousin, Harry returns to Hogwarts anyway. Strange mishaps occur to Harry as further warnings to leave, and at the same time there are random attacks against others, leaving students literally petrified. Our trio of young wizards then learn about the chamber of secrets and what it holds, and that the heir of Slytherin will use it to extinguish muggle-born students. Worried that the heir has returned and is causing the random attacks, our trio plucks around for answers. Harry is accused of being the heir when it's discovered he can speak Parseltongue(Snake language). When Hermione winds up petrified, Harry and Ron seek and the chamber of secrets, leading to the truth. I'll save that for surprise.There is so much action in this movie. There's a flying car, more Quidditch matches, a nest of huge spiders, a dueling club, and plenty of spells. Far more spells than the first movie. Hermione still casts more spells than her friends. Personally, Hermione is one of my favorite characters. It's in this film that the friendship between Hermione and the boys is really established. They're in things together and they back each other up. Also featured is a new dark arts defense teacher, and more clues about the mysterious past of lord Voldemort. This movie I give a 10/10. Awesome acting, terrific special effects, wonderful plot.",10,0,2,16 August 2007
The Lion King," A true original Disney classic!
","I remember watching this movie when it first came out on video as a little kid. Now I'm grown up and much older, but my feelings about this movie remain the same. It's terrific. One of the first movies I really came to love. Little kids and parents will both enjoy this classic kid's movie from Disney, despite being an older movie.It's easy to understand The Lion King's success if you look at the cast. It's got Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, etc. These are great actors, and they do all of their parts well. The comedy was pulled of well, the dramatic scenes were awesome, and the songs are just plain wonderful. I honestly wish Disney made more stuff like this, since I feel some of their recent stuff is horrible. This movie had the plot, scenery, and dialog of a truly great kid's movie.The story is that Simba is a young prince, son of king Mufasa, and heir to the pride-lands. The pride-lands are the beautiful plains where many peaceful animals live. Scar, Mefusa's brother, is outraged that Simba is before him in line for the throne. Scar's corrupt soul only desires to be ruler, so he plots with the outcast hyenas of the out-lands to kill Mefusa and Simba. During the scheme, Mefusa dies while Simba escapes. Simba, however, thinks he's responsible for his father's death because of a chat with Scar. Scar becomes ruler, and his hyena henchmen take over the pride-lands and devour everything.Meanwhile, Simba is rescued and befriended by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog who live carefree lives in a beautiful land away from the pride-lands. Simba learns to live without responsibilities or worries, and puts his past behind him. Then he runs into his old best friend, Nala. Nala tells Simba of what has happened to his homelands, and with some counseling from a baboon named Rafiki, Simba returns home. Accompanied by Nala, Timon, Pumbaa, and even Rafiki, Simba fights scar and takes his place as king.I still have my original VHS copy of this movie, and I still watch it to this day. It is a truly great combination of drama, comedy, life lessons, and musical songs in a Disney movie. This movie is one of the best of all time. Get a copy if you can. You will not be disappointed.",10,2,2,22 September 2007
WALL·E," I don't like political messages in family flicks.
","I would give this an 8 or a 9 out of ten. I found the characters unique, the directing good, the jokes quite funny, and the animation nice. Also, the story is for the most part pretty good. It's actually got some originality to it, which you don't see often these days. I also found the pacing to be quite effective. Overall, the effort they put into this movie turned out to be pretty good.So why am I giving it a 6/10? Because they had to put political messaging in the movie. I really don't like that in family or children's movies. The actual plot of the Earth being a wasteland that has to be abandoned in the future isn't really the problem. The problem is how they send messages towards the end of the film suggesting that we are actually destroying our world. I don't have a problem with the message in general, but why is it politically placed in a family film with a serious tone? Are we trying to scare our children and show them harshness at an early age? I just don't see the point at all.Other than that, the movie is pretty good.",6,1,4,18 February 2010
