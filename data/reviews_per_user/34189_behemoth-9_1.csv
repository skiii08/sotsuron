Scarface," Performance's lost in a blood colour mess
","Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert Loggia, √Ångel Salazar... are great. It's a pleasure to see how they act. They characters are shown exactly how they expected to be and sometimes more than it. Dialogs are remarkable too. Tony's tricks, Chi Chi's manners, Elvira's eyes, Mama's anger - each one worth watching. All this could impress, but...After about a half of film you feel satisfied with acting, you know all characters, know what are they, what they do and even can predict how then end. It's too long, if shortened film would be sharpened. And finally, red colour seems too dominating. Without shootings film surely loses style, but in my opinion it's too unreasonable here. What does it stand for? Nothing but a plot? Performance's lost in a blood colour mess, I think.",4,4,8,7 March 2006
