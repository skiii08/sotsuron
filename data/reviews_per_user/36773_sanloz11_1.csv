The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Absolute Junk
","I loved the first movie, the second was OK... they just get worse and worse. This was PATHETIC! It was like a cheap soap opera you see on TV during the day. the acting was horrible, it sounded like they were reading from scripts in a practice run and the movie dragged. Not to mention the sound track!The first one was great with a lot of Muse used, it added real excitement! But this was pathetic. What a waste of my time. There were parts where I though 'oh it's going to get good now' ... and then it just went back to where it was... junk. watch this movie just so that you can understand how crap it really was.",1,7,9,11 February 2012
