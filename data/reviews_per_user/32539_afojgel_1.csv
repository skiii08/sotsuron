Hereditary," Stop reading any negative comments and watch this movie!
","I am an avid fan of the horror genre and started feeling hopeless about the next time i will see a movie that will move me.
Hereditary did it and i am grateful first of all to this f..ing amazing actress called Toni Collete.
Man,she is bringing the best performance of her career.
The cinematography it's beautiful and original.The suspense created by subtle sounds on the background.
It's a whole experience,thank you Mr Ari Aster for directing this movie with such craftsmanship.
And for give us hope that it's still possible to make a great horror-drama movie.",9,18,36,22 August 2018
