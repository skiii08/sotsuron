The Incredible Hulk," Just Give It A Freakin' Chance!!!
","I loved it. I missed the last 10 or 15 minutes because a determined girlfriend thought it was stupid, but she thinks most things are indeed stupid. I'm even definitively stupid, so her opinion goes out the window right NOW.The original hulk was a foul waste of time, and while it failed to please us, it cleared the path of Hulk's origins to give us the clash of the Hulk and Abomination. There are many little details just waiting in here, and if you catch them, it adds to the experience greatly. It has love, humor, action, suspense. Everything the Hulk can be counted on for, and then a bit more after that.Even better, while in the original the Hulk was a very flat green, just very very big, this time he's got more veins than a steroids addict. It's amazing to see the detail on the characters, the plot and even the jokes.",8,3,5,20 June 2008
Memento," Haven't you already seen this comment?
","Perhaps, but perhaps not. Maybe you've seen one like it. Maybe it's entirely unique and on its own.This film is a brilliant piece, written by a Nolan, directed by a Nolan. Perhaps you've seen it. If not, go see it. If so, go see it... just to be sure.The plot revolves around a man named Leonard, who, after a little... trauma... cannot form a new memory. His disability has left him paranoid, and dependent on his Polaroid pictures and incessant tattoos. With little on his side, Leonard must figure out a mystery so stunningly deep, you won't see the end coming from miles away.Prepare to feel as though your memory slipped, and prepare to keep a few mementos of your own. This is definitely one that will stick with you.",10,1,4,16 April 2008
Alice in Wonderland," A Love Letter
","Without spewing the same remarks as the few reviews I glossed over, let me skip straight past the plot and on to the finer fare- the actual decision if it's good or not.The answer, in short, is that it's great but only if you're absolutely obsessed with the two original books. This film, start to finish is nothing short of a love letter (thus the title of this review) from Burton to Lewis Carroll. It lovingly tweaks and twists at all the classic characters, summoning the Jabberwock (or as it's incorrectly known here, the Jabberwocky) but not forgetting the Jubjub bird or the frumious Bandersnatch. The only casting choice I find myself disliking is the infamous Depp as the Hatter. I actually think a relatively small- time actor would have lent himself to the role far better.The visuals are superb, with the always... eerie Cheshire Cat hitting a perfect blend between guide and traitor. Furthermore, the slight explanation of Cheshire Cat's ability to disappear is a nice touch to bring some reality to an otherwise extremely odd world.",9,4,7,15 March 2010
