Raiders of the Lost Ark," And the Raids by Mr Indiana Jones Began a trend !
","Its rare to come across a good history-adventure movie which makes the audience sit back take have a nostalgic feel irrespective of the age and the year when one wants to watch the movie.
Mr Steven Spielberg is defiantly gifted in term of the screenplay and the cinematic experience definitely makes you want to watch the movie again.

Black Panther," Wakanda forever !
","Black Panther movie connects with one very quickly. The movie takes off as the president of the country is shot very early at the United Nations convention.
New leader has to be selected, and the dual that the village has to go through evolves as all the participating tribes gathers for the challenge.
The movie leaves aark as the story evolves into how the highly advance culture takes the vaccum in the leadership and fills it with challenges that comes with the day to day working.",8,1,4,1 March 2020
RED," Oh My God , what a movie !
","Just sit down with your gang of old friends, feeling old. Get a blanket and have some popcorn. Movie is good to keep you entertained for an hour and half. By the time the movie is over one would wonder if the actors are old or we as audience. Time to hit the gym and go on a date I suppose. Long time.",9,0,0,1 March 2020
