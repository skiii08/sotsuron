The Equalizer," Black Rambo in a mall
","The movie started pretty good. That's why it's getting the extra star. But I swear I was laughing when it finished. The best part was when Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) killed the Russian mob with that nailing machine and turned around and left, when Ralfie was shot twice and scared to death in the control room, 20 meters away. hahahaha. Awesome Robert!I can not even say until what point I was enjoying the movie. It gradually went down until I was not taking it seriously any more. I liked his skills. In this kind of action movies, we usually like when the guy knows what is he doing; like Liam Neeson, in Taken, or Matt Damon, as Jason Bourne. May be Denzel was actually too good; kinda analytical. Almost a superhero. He could be one of the Avengers. If he would have Batman gadgets, he would beat Batman.I definitely didn't like how overloaded he was of all the stuff. A guy who has been living a peaceful life for years and suddenly the girl and the Russian mafia, Ralfie's mom and the corrupt cops and the robber in the mall, who he had to find somehow. This is like when a random guy gets bit by a spider and becomes Spiderman, and suddenly all around is crime. Come on...The girl and the Russian mafia was totally enough to make a story...Now, the Russian mafia. When you watch a documentary about them, they look like more scary and more smart. So, to go to see one of the mobs you have to go through a room where Chinese people are counting tones of Russian corrupt money? Are you serious? And this guy gets in there and walk seeing all of this with no problem? Thanks director for not making him go there with a Go Pro Hero camera with a selfie stick.Then this mall situation. You know when someone gets trapped in the cleaning room and makes a bomb with the cleaning products? And remember when Rambo prepares all this traps and things in the jungle? This two things mixed in one, in a mall, where he has got everything he needs. Such a stupid idea. First of all I don't understand why would he go there without a gun. But OK. But why wouldn't he take any of the guns of all this people he kills? Instead, he gets this nailing machine. And you see Denzel in slow motion cocking a nailing machine. The only thing missing was the name 'BOSCH' on the side of the it. Ridiculous!To sum up in two words. Bad movie.",2,12,23,12 January 2016
Gravity," Really? Almost 8 stars?
","The movie was OK, but far from 8 stars. The visuals were pretty good. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) was getting on my nerves. I kinda liked when he died.This is why he was getting on my nerves:-Stone: Oxygen down to 2 percent.-Kowalski: Isn't it beautiful?-Stone: What?-Kowalski: The sunrise....Are you kidding me? She just said 'OXyGEN DOWN TO 2 PERCENT'. Isn't it better to not talk (especially about bullshit) and keep the oxygen, I don't know, for breathing may be? I guess the plan was to distract her in order her to think about something else. Now, is it possible anyone to think about anything else when he/she is running out of oxygen?Anyways...Of course the oxygen keeps going down to 1 percent and later on the 'Oxygen Low' alarm goes off. They have a situation and Kowalski gets detached and drifting in the space (this is when I got happy), and she now needs to get into the station. They still have connection tho.-Kowalski: You are attracted to me right?-Stone: What?-Kowalski: People say I have beautiful blue eyes....Whaaaaaat? First of all George Clooney has brown eyes. Besides that, She is dying man! She needs to be focused in getting into the station. How can this script be written and approved? It's awful!5 stars out of 10 for visuals.",5,1,2,11 January 2016
Oblivion," Confusing
","There was one good thing in this movie. His music collection in that little ecosystem he had made.I still don't know who sent this 'Tet' and why did it blow up the poor Moon. Also, what was that truth he (Jack Harper) found out when he went to the 'radiation zone'? I have the impression some scenes were cut out from the movie I watched, although it lasted entire 2 hours. I could feel how I was getting old during these 2 hours. OMGThan his dreams. His memories. Now, has he been wiped out or not? OK, the machine had failed. Lucky him the dreams remained were of his beloved and, why not to say, hot wife instead of his grandfather. Otherwise he wound have this strange dreams with an old man, that probably would drive him nuts.Another 'observation'. There is this explosion they see and Jack is ordered to not check it out. He does! there are 4 or 5 survivors. One of them is the girl he has been dreaming about. The drones come and start shooting them all and he is right next to the girl, so he avoids her death by putting himself in front of the girl, so the drone gets nuts, deciding whether to terminate the target or all good. Finally the drone decides to leave in peace and not to shoot. This assures American military institution was not involved in its design... ..Now what's the probability of (1)being the only curious Jack Harper out of thousands out there. Because Morgan Freeman said 'He was different'. (2)Of having dreams about a women he doesn't know, (3)to be the only survivor of a crush that he (4)supposed to not to assist? I am not a statistics expert and I say 'HA'. If I would be statistics expert I would say 'OOOOH S**T'.Not to mention the concept of having these 'clones' working in a remote place with the promise they are going to go home in couple of weeks has already been used in Moon(2009), which is pretty good done. I don't know. If I would have the director in front of me right now I would ask him bunch of questions, because the movie is confusing and not real even in the sci-fi world.",4,0,1,9 January 2016
Godzilla," What a bullshit!
","This movie was just awful. So, Godzilla came to protect us! From these 'monsters' (MUTOs) that eat nukes for what? Because they need radiation? Stupid! Godzilla was good designed, but barely appeared and was too slow. The MUTOs were awfully designed. Were very ugly. Not cool at all.The characters were not interesting. There actors were not good either. Except Bryan Cranston, who died in the beginning. Even the kid, that had couple of lines, was acting bad.And the ending? Goodbye Godzilla. Thank you for coming to save us. Now go back to the ocean. See you next time a monster comes out. Such a good pet!",1,8,15,13 January 2016
