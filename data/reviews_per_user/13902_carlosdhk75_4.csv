The Incredible Hulk," Good but the first one is much better
","I saw the first hulk movie five years ago, and I really liked the story, the music, the style, not one hundred percent perfect, but well developed in many aspects.And about this sequel I had my doubts, especially because since is directed by another person and performed by different actors the essence of the film might not be the same.Some things as for instance how hulk looks like, is improved in this version, It seems more realistic and furious, Edward Norton also plays well his character, and the rest of the cast does a good job too, the action scenes are impressive, but all in all, the movie lacks of an interesting story or at least in my opinion, the first movie had an story arc much more solid and suspenseful.They ignore almost completely the prequel and it's best achievement, for instance the comic style, and some important point as the story that was told. This one omits all that and starts over.Well I just can say that I liked this one, but making a comparison its predecessor is much more interesting in every level from the story to the visual concept and even the performances.Anyway is a nice and entertaining film and worth to see it.",7,1,4,10 July 2008
Terminator Salvation," Entertaining, but no point in this sequel
","Well the movie It's not that bad, in fact It's entertaining, but even thought you can find good actors (not necessarily good performance) and art direction I didn't feel the plot fill what you think the mythology has to achieve, in the end too predictable.I believe they thought about getting back the franchise and make more sequels, so they said 'Let's not do something that good in this one so that we can produce three more and make more money'And on the other hand having watched the unfortunately cancelled The Sarah Connor chronicles, You see the difference between an interesting and well developed story arc and a poor one, it's really a shame this show wasn't renewed, and had a short life because it really was taking the story to a direction worth to see it, and not just any action movie repeating it self over and over.Anyway if you are fan you got to see this one and make your own conclusions, I guess It could be worst, but I don't feel like seeing more, only if they take back The Sarah Connor chronicles someday.",6,2,3,7 July 2009
The Dark Knight," Good comic adaptation
","There has been a lot of expectation about this movie, especially because of heath ledger's Joker performance and his unfortunate dead after finishing the film.Certainly Ledger's performance is one of the major points of the film; he really constructed a complex villain without fitting in to the stereotypes you could imagine for the joker.The rest of the cast do a good job as well. The story has some interesting turns that you don't expect if you are not a fan of the comics, I mean that people who has read them might know what could happen next in the story. Notwithstanding the plot has it's variations of course from the comic book, so the suspense is not affected.I think, this is a well conceived second part for the new Batman films adaptation directed by Christopher Nolan, who gave the films an interesting and realistic sense. I have to say that I liked more the first one (Batman begins) maybe because that one surprised me more at the time I saw it.This one left the story open for a third instalment, which I hope , might be as good as the previous films.",8,2,5,31 July 2008
Iron Man," Good but not that good
","Well, I didn't have great expectations about this movie, I mean I imagined this could be a nice and entertained film, but not as good as some in the same category, for instance Batman begins, x-men or hulk which in my opinion are very good comic adaptations.When I saw the cast Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, I thought that the film would worth the trouble to see it.I have to say that the film is well performed and that has outstanding visual effects. The art direction is also well conceived.On the other hand the plot is quite predictable, and I wouldn't have complained if it were more interesting or suspenseful, but all in all, is not a bad start, and since due to it success in box office, they announced a part 2, I hope they will improved the script for that one.",7,3,6,20 May 2008
