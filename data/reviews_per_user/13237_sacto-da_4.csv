50 First Dates," Could have been better.
","'50 First Dates' features Adam Sandler in a more subdued comedic role than he has previously exhibited in films. His performance in '50 First Dates' is much akin to 'The Wedding Singer', which is a pleasant deviation from his recently zany roles in outrageous comedies. He is teamed once again with Drew Barrymore, and, they once again develop a romance- yet is a romance really a romance when one of the partners cannot recall your name the following morning? Lucy(Drew) appears to have a memory problem, short-term amnesia, where she cannot recall any events of the previous day. This is a sweet, charming, sometimes too sentimental, sometimes too implausible, and even smart, romantic comedy, featuring some delightful performances by Sandler and Barrymore, who once again prove their status as a romantic team in movies. The ending lacked much resolution, but at least it ended on a good note.",6,0,1,3 January 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A funny but odd movie
","What can I saw about this movie? Very interesting, some what funny. Did show how men before the women's movement acted. I was to young to remember it. I am sure this wasn't far from the truth in how women were treated. I am glad thing have changed. A lot more out there for women. I think the best part of the movie was the Anchorman Rumble with all the news anchors from other stations. The scene at the zoo was okay. It got to be a bit silly. Frankly the whole movie was a bit silly. I didn't like Jack Black's biker dude kicking the dog over the bridge. I didn't think is was all that funny. All in all not a bad movie.

Fantastic Four," Not Bad At All!
","8/10 Movie: Fantastic Four (2005) It's funny. I watched three movies today. Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Robots and now this movie. Out of the three I liked this one the best. I thought all the actors did a wonderful job. There was a few slow parts and maybe the dialog was a bit cheesy. But so was the comic book. The Torch and The Thing were my favorite of the main four. And even thou he was Dr. Doom. That man can sure shock me anytime! What a sexy, sexy man......Okay back to the movie. I am really glad I seen Fantastic Four. I found it very entertaining. And hope they make a F4-2. I will watch it. I would recommend it, highly. Donna A.",8,5,7,5 February 2006
The Island," Nothing is as it seems......on The Island
",I really liked this movie. I have no idea why some folks didn't like it. Both Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson were both very good. Of course Sean Bean playing the bad guy. Would love to see this guy play a good guy for once. I have to admit that there were other movies based on similar theme. But that doesn't matter. I still enjoyed this movie. And it does give you food for thought about cloning. I haven't seen much of Scarlett Johansson work. But I feel this is going to one hell of an actress. And she will go a long way. While other actress in her age group will long be left in the back row. And I have yet seen Ewan give a bad performance. He is one of my favorite actors. So don't listen to the critics and go with your own heart. I think you'll like this movie. Donna A.,8,0,0,19 January 2006
