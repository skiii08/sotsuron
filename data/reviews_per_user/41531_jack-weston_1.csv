Conquest 1453," A work of propaganda and nothing more.
","This movie is terrible to watch at for several reasons, but one of the main reasons is that this movie is not an artistic work, but instead a propaganda production, pro-Turkey and pro-Allah.Everything in this movie just screams at you for being exaggerated. For one, every time a Turkish land is presented, it is sunny and nice music is playing, people are dressed nicely and they are smiling.On the other hand, when the Vatican is shown, dark clouds loom above it, the streets are empty and everyone is frowning. When other western lands are shown, they are shown as chaotic and in decadence.When the emperor Constantine makes his speech in the arena, the people are shown with blisters on their faces and with dirty cheeks.Mehmet II is shown as this superhero know-it all. He is a great hunter, a scene just put there for no reason, to show us how great of a hunter he is. A good lover. A great father. A scholar, he is shown studying, analyzing and everything.The people of Constantinople are shown as shouting 'Death to the Turks' and then at the end, Mehmet II walks in a church and tells the people how they won't be persecuted for their religion. Very convenient, when in fact, history - and present day shows us that the Turks were always the ones shouting death to the unfaithful, and not the other way around.The duke of Genoa is shown as this fat, greedy man - when it couldn't be further from the truth.Emperor Constantine and his advisers are shown as this evil creatures, always plotting, always speaking in a sneaky and evil voice.Even for the untrained eye, even for those not involved in any way (emotionally or otherwise) this movie is pure propaganda seen from a mile away. This is not a work of art, this is not a work of movie production. This is no more than the equivalent of what Hitler did in demonizing the Allies and praising the Aryan race. This is the same thing, in modern times, subtlety done, but nonetheless the same thing.And for any Turks or Muslim brothers who are reading this - you should feel insulted too, as insulted as I am, for this movie betrays the Ottoman history and our values. Mehmet II wasn't this superhero and he did a lot of bad things - and that's OK.The fall of Constantinople may be a 'victory' for that time, but in the long run, it was one of the poorest decisions ever made, because by gaining Constantinople, Mehmet II lost Rumelia (the current whole Balkan peninsula, including Albania, Serbia, Bulgaria, etc.).But that's history.You should be insulted because this movie shows suicide bombings not once, but twice. Both Turkish, both in the name of Allah - shouting Allahu Akbar. This is not a good thing for any Muslim, and certainly not for Islam. This is poor movie, showing poor values, false history, unfair to both sides in different ways. You should definitely watch it nonetheless, so you understand in the future how someone is trying to change your views and mess with your perception on reality.This movie was endorsed and supported by the Turkish government and the Muslim ministry of culture.
