The Devil's Advocate," A film for the latter days
","What an extraordinary film! And I don't mean just its artistic or technical side, but also its spiritual meanings. Of course, the story is great, the directing is great, the acting... Al Pacino, Keanu, Charlize. Oh, by the way, and I loved it how they had dissected the American myth of the successful lawyer (but it's much, much more that that). Anyway, back to my point: remember that great scene when Milton explains almost literally the mechanisms of corruption and self-degradation, while walking in the streets with his young 'pupil'? If it was only for that key for salvation in everyday life and the movie would have been a must see! Well, when I had left the cinema, I heard two guys commenting on it: 'Wow, the system is so perfect, you can't get away'. Exactly the opposite of my thought! And then I recalled the saying of the Revelation, which goes something like that: he who is just, let him be just, and he who is corrupt, let him be corrupt. In other words, people had made their choices, the time has come. Well, are we really living the last days of our ripe world as we knew it or what? Very intriguing.",9,1,1,9 October 2005
Citizen Kane," 'Kane' vs. 'Intolerance'
","I was disappointed. A work of art should be viewed as a whole. So, besides its ground-breaking techniques, which are brilliant, this film seems to me not to 'get together'. There is something over-ambitious in it, surpassing the actors' and (don't shoot) perhaps even Welles' possibilities at the time. The story is simple, the characters are sketchy and motivation-lacking, and the 'Rosebud' search reminds me of the melodramatic search for the Immortal Beloved in Bernard Rose's film (lame, I know), but fortunately it remained a mystery. With all that hype about the 'greatest film ever' (???), it's too easy to be disappointed about 'Kane'. And speaking of technical aspects, why not equally praise Griffith's 'Intolerance' (1916)? Me, at least, I do so.",6,19,39,5 August 2006
Midnight in Paris," The visuals!
","This dreamy film is especially moving due to its atmosphere, and I admit I didn't know how to explain it. Of course the visuals are stunning, but it's not just that. Obviously the 'artsy' premise is decisive for that magic feel. Even Owen Wilson, whom I usually don't like, added a touch of innocence and credibility, despite the fact that his character was a 21st century Allen (and well done, for that matter). It's very rare that a film suggests so strongly an atmosphere. I don't know how much has this artistic and idealized Paris in common with the one in the real world of today. But it's worth it. Previously I wasn't that fascinated by Paris as some of my friends... Previously!",7,0,0,9 October 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Biopics' disease: more entertainment than real drama
","Biopics are always tricky: fans are outraged by the inevitable historical inaccuracies and omissions, or mindlessly blown-away by seeing (again) their idol. But those issues are not the point: the first one can be addressed only in a lengthy documentary or in a research book, while the second is as subjective as one can be (my friend who watched the film with me was thrilled simply because she is a Queen fan).From a strictly cinematic perspective, the critics are right, this film is almost a flop because it has no strong, central idea besides recreating Freddie on screen (which is very well done). Most acting is fine, lookalikes are amazing ('Brian May', 'Freddie'), the concert scenes are great, cinematography is very good, but the film is full of the clichÃ©s common in biopics about artistic characters. It also offers an almost bowdlerized image of Freddie and the band's entourage, creative aspects are dealt with incredible superficiality, and generally speaking the movie is marred by the simplistic approach of a tribute. The twisting of reality, which in 'Amadeus' served a strong, fictional central idea (what's the difference between genius and talent), is useless and embarrassing in this film.As usual, real life drama is more impressive and touching than the concoction served by most biopics, as is the case here. To avoid disappointing, the better biopics focus only on one main event in the life of their character, instead of trying in vain to tell hastily a story which took years or decades to unfold and develop.So, is this film good? It's worth watching for the acting and the re-creating of the atmosphere, but when recent, easily verifiable facts are distorted with no artistic benefit as in this movie, what should we expect from a movie with a historical subject? Ultimately, watching the original concerts and videos of the band is more rewarding, and that will remain.",6,5,8,11 November 2018
American Beauty," It didn't age well
","Am I tough or what? But seriously, isn't it the most overrated film since Citizen Kane? I've seen some movies over the years, read some books, listened to some music, and so on, but the more I tried while watching and re-watching it, the more I realized American Beauty was a bit forced. They were trying too hard, and that refers sometimes even to that bunch of good actors, too, who haven't really been able to save some too unreal moments in the script. It has some good ideas and scenes, but they sink in the pretentious, leveling dullness. In fact, besides their particular dramas, all characters are more or less alike (frustrated), and the fancy obsession with recognizing beauty in everyday life (to clean a bit the sad story) was not that convincing. Well, that's me, sorry, I need more. Good for those who really liked it.",7,0,5,9 March 2007
The Matrix," Sheer masterpiece! And it's not about the future
","This is one of the best films ever! Why? Just watch it. I won't discuss the concept, which is simply brilliant, nor the photography, which is astonishing. Special effects? Come on... Acting? Dialog? Script? Editing? Directing? How could I? Even now, when I remembered the film, I remain almost speechless. 'The Matrix' is a landmark in the history of cinema, and more. Many scenes are so fascinating that anyone's hair would stand on its end while watching, and for many reasons, visual or spiritual.Because this film is not just a film, but an art work that transforms you, it gives you a deeper perspective on life and yourself. So, it is really great art, at a level reached by surprisingly few movies. OK, it has its Buddhist themes. So what? Isn't it all about truth, freedom and the individual? Are these not fundamental questions for anyone? Isn't the perspective of this movie on them tremendous and extremely touching? And the ending... Wow... A rare, powerful and effective way to end a great film. The fight will go on and on (compare Neo's approach to the Stalker's in Tarkowsky's masterpiece). Because the story is not just a sci-fi about some bleak future, it's a parable (like any good sci-fi) about the very present day, about what is real now, and how free are you now.P. S. The sequels are disappointing and mere lame action sci-fi thrillers. Too bad. No more real spiritual concepts, but over-complicated plots and inconsistent new characters. Never mind, let's forgive the Wachowskys for wanting some extra cash, since they have given the world this masterpiece in the first part of the trilogy!",10,0,1,18 October 2005
Click," Almost good (the Faust myth revisited)
","For a Sandler movie, this is surprisingly good, and it has a rather interesting script and some good acting moments (including Sandler!). Of course, you couldn't get along without the humping dogs, fart jokes and some other trivial stuff which have been Sandler's kind of trademark. But it's refreshing how they mixed drama, aging and death in a comedy. Walken was very good, probably the best, as the rest of the cast were almost as sketchy as their characters. There are some twists (some surprising, other corny), Sandler has a few moments, but I couldn't escape the feeling that all was treated too superficially. I laughed a couple of times or so, felt emotion at the dad and death scenes (more because of the situation itself), still something was missing. A reworking of the script, or a better cast, at least.",6,0,2,15 July 2007
