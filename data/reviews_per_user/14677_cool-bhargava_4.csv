Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Warning: You May Laugh Your A** Out
","This movie is hilarious. It is exactly the opposite of a sophisticated film and if you don't appreciate good comedy then it's a waste. And while watching this, you might wanna put your Women and Jews to bed because Sacha is extremely offensive to both of them.But it's a satire considering Sacha himself is a Jew. The movie raises a whole lot of questions and controversies but the bottom line remains that one, it's funny as hell and second there is a 'hidden' message behind it. The dialogues are the best, each scene is another roll on the couch. This just keeps getting funnier and funnier. One of the things worth appreciating is Sacha's acting here, his whole 'Khazakistan' accent is brilliant and his 'timing' is excellent. Even the tiniest little details are worth appreciating and funny.",8,0,0,3 May 2009
Kung Fu Panda," Philosophical, Funny & Entertaining
","Now this is one film that that is philosophical, funny, entertaining and not just for kids but for all ages. No matter how predictable the story maybe, it still keeps you glued to your seat plus the moral 'there is no secret recipe' makes you want to believe in your self , no matter how hopeless, obsessed or how much idealistic you are about anything. The movies is well targeted , keeping in mind that one is aiming for all age groups. There is animation for kids, there action for teenagers and there is a moral for the adults to impart to their young ones , who plan to sit beside them and watch it and also for the youth to realize that no mater what anyone says the only two things important are Focus and Perseverance. The animation is one of the best in recent times and the colors in the movie have been well chosen considering the whole 'china- look' and the kung fu theme, these keep your eyes constantly on the screen. The humour is typical Jack Black -casual, silly and goofy which makes look like a one that has a hanger stuck inside. But one thing different about this film is that, on top of all this one really attaches himself to the characters which are all so varied. Again one of the most common things used in films is how characters of comics or fantasies are basically animals, this is done because nature itself is so varied and one can easily identify each one characteristics by the animal it is, Panda- fat hence perceived as lazy or slow, Tiger- Furious and Strong, Mantis - Small yet fast and clever , Snake- Focus, vigilance and reflexes and Monkey- Fast, flexible and active, relatively less furious. These characters take you on a journey filled with dreams ,aspirations and fun.Review by Scenes 1) Oogway DiesTo me this scene marks, the point where Shifu has to take a major decision and believe not only in himself but also in his master. In is after this moment he realises that he can train Po, he only has to guide and nurture him. The scene is very well shot, specially when Oogway dies and the petals seem to take him way, this I think also represents that we all are part of mother nature and that one day we shall all turn and get mixed in to the very elements of the world- fire ,water, earth and air.2) Po's trainingThis is one scene, where there is a a lot fun, it's filled with action, very attractive animationand it also represents how there is always a way to make a person learn and understand, one just has to know the art of doing so. As in this case it was food, so reaching someone through the things that can motivate and makes him focus him is essential. In the end , after the training when he finally gives the dumpling to Shifu, this shows that when a person has self -actualized , he rises over petty pleasures.3) Tai Lung's EscapeThis is very well written and shot. This makes the audience feel thrilled and tense at the same moments as Lung escapes. The prison looks all the more mystical and intense by keeping the contrast low and making it go underground. 4) Opening Scene (Dream)The opening scene begins with Po's dream, which represents the inner desire of a fan or a person who is so idealistic. The dream has people shouting 'awesome' and the five saying to Po ,'we should hang out'. This represents that Po wanted to know 'the five' and be like them, he wanted people to like him and see him at the magnificent one.5) The Dragon ScrollIt is Ironic how the thing perceived to be legendary and to be known to also the paranormal is just about believing in one's self. In the scene when Po gets the Dragon Scroll, it is shot is a way that that shows the it is the most prized possession one can get and only one person can have it. But the truth is anyone can achieve , if he/she wishes to believe.",7,0,1,23 March 2009
12 Angry Men," Simplicity At It's Best!
",It's undoubtedly one of the finest works of cinema directed my Sidney Lumet. The actors portray the characters that they depict so wonderfully with such brilliance that one tends to get totally engrossed in the film and script. The script should be appreciated for it's simplicity- 12 Jurors and just one room. The audience gets tense and sweats in suspense as the final verdict comes closer. And also a great work of camera is done by Boris Kauffman where he makes the screen less wide as the end approaches that the viewer too gets the feel of the tension and the claustrophobia. It's intriguing to know how 12 different people come together and use their varied experiences to come to their final verdict.,9,0,0,30 April 2009
Avatar," Great Effort!
","Considering the fact, that at the start of almost every Fantasy/ Sci-Fi movie I think 'I am I really suppose to buy this?', this film did a reasonably good job, and what it lacked in dialogues and wittiness, it sure did make up for it in special effects and action sequences.The story-line and the romantic theme are cheesy but the movie is a lot more than just the predictable sequences. The philosophical aspect of the movie is not something everyone can relate to, though the effort sure deserves an applause. But the real core of the film is the world created, truly exceptional and mesmerizing, and setting a new benchmark for Sci-Fi/Adventure Films.",7,0,1,24 December 2009
