The King's Speech," I can't think of one reason to recommend this film !
","Another poor effort that gets incredible praise by just about everyone. This kind of thing (the film and the praise) makes me think that this may be why our world is so 'screwed up' in so many ways. That is, there is little attention to detail. Instead, the 'buzz' is that this is something 'great' and that all reasonable people must like it. Some, such as C. Hitchens, have already pointed out significant historical flaws, but let's think of the 'big picture' here. Did this speech really do much? If so, how would one demonstrate that this is true? It certainly doesn't make any sense to me. Would the British have curled up in a fetal position and surrendered to the Germans if the speech had gone terribly wrong? Of course not.So what else is there? A 'feel good story?' Okay, fine, but I'd rather see one about a person who comes from the lowest social strata overcoming great obstacles to actually do real things that help real people. Could it work as an intriguing psychological study? Yes, but it doesn't. Whether this is due to the script, the acting, something else, or some combination doesn't interest me enough to spend a lot of time thinking about it.Is it a 'historical portrait' of an era? Yes, it had to be, but it's not especially good at doing this (plenty of better films in this context)! Is it about 'bullying' and how to overcome it, as some are suggesting? Sure, you're going to get me to believe that a British prince is like a gay high school student getting brutalized in today's world. And what bridge are you offering for sale this evening? Even if this were the case, I can't imagine many teenagers doing anything other than falling asleep no more than twenty minutes into this film.Perhaps it's a 'buddy film?' Oh stop it already. It just was not very good, despite the 'feel-good buzz' or however such mediocre efforts get marketed as well as this one was. Let me just add that I really looked forward to this film. I was hoping for a much more historically-accurate presentation. I often watch films that I don't think are that good if there is a good overall historical rendering. The film-makers of this one, by contrast, seem to have adopted a 'play it safe' strategy, and then relied on good marketing. If this film 'rings true' for you and you 'love' it, I have to admit that I envy you, at least on one level.",3,31,64,27 January 2011
Black Swan," Portrait of a severe 'nervous breakdown.'
","I'm no ballet expert so I won't speak to that aspect of the film. Basically, you get to see what used to be called a nervous breakdown (do psychologists still use this phrase?), accompanied by Hollywood special effects and production values. Was the symbolism interesting? Perhaps, but I was too bored to pay too much attention, to be honest. What's the point? She lives with her mother, who likely has OCD and is overprotective, and she's in a high-pressure situation, and probably has been since childhood. It's an ugly film, really, and there's not much to be garnered from it, other than what any 'normal' adult probably already knows, about life in general.I'm all for ugly films, actually, but I need something else, to 'break the tension.' In the foreign film, 'The Forest for the Trees,' the young teacher keeps talking about 'new techniques' that she will use in her classes, yet all we see is her being treated badly by her students while she fumbles around, having difficulty doing the basics. It's that kind of 'sick humor' that can work in this kind of film, at least for me, but in 'Black Swan,' it's just a buildup to the obvious. Of course, they could have had a different ending, but where else could it go? Essentially, it's too one-dimensional to be considered a 'must see,' that's for sure.",5,9,23,19 December 2010
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A big missed opportunity here.
","This was really three movie's worth jammed into one, unfortunately. Why not make three movies exploring the lives of the main characters and providing a sense of what is happening on the planets they inhabit? And I'd like to know why there's an Asian Ninja guy who talks a lot about the Force yet isn't a Jedi? And so on (they could have even spent some time on how the main robot character came to develop a conscious, whereas his robot buddies did not!). As others have said, this felt rushed, yet some of the dialog was rather stiff, but to me the biggest problem was the acting. The 'universe' felt like Star Wars but the main characters felt like they were from somewhere else, a boring galaxy far away, perhaps. While I disliked the Asian Ninja guy character most (seems like they did this to appeal to the Asian viewing markets), it's easy to overlook the one character and enjoy the rest. But after a while I began thinking that if one of the characters went to a refrigerator and took out a can of Coke or Pepsi, it would not be at all surprising!I liked the idea of the film though as I said it should have been divided by three, and the action scenes were good, but to me it registers as a good Star Wars-ish action film. If that's what you want, you'll likely get it. However, I don't think you'll get anything 'deeper.' For example, why not spend some time on showing us why the 'average Joe' is tempted by the Dark Side? Instead, we get boring or basic/stiff dialog that had a deadening effect on the film. The previous effort wasn't very good, but it felt like a kind of kiddie version of a 'good' Star Wars film, whereas this one has more of a 'mish mash' feel. I can imagine an excellent film after what I saw (or two or three), but I wish I had seen that film!",4,11,21,25 December 2016
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in the Garden of 'Manhattan' (1979) ?
","It begins as a low-end travel agency commercial, with irritating jazzy music (that's out of place, in my experience). Then we see Owen Wilson as the latest Woody 'stand in.' And then we are exposed to the usual self-absorbed individuals (in Allen films) who think they are special. Aren't these the kinds of people you don't want to spend any time with if you can avoid doing so? If not, perhaps this movie is for you! It's almost like Woody doesn't understand that society is not exactly the same as it was (for him if nobody else) in the 60s or 70s. In the age of the mortgage crisis and the destruction of the American middle class, this movie is a proverbial rubbing of salt in the wounds of the injured ! We soon learn that a screenwriter wants to give up his career because he has visions of being a 'starving artist' in Paris. Why? If you are going to present this idea at a time like now, you need to supply some back story. I'm wondering what's going on in Woody's mind. Does he enjoy spending his time with such obnoxious individuals (that is, just about everyone in this film), or is he trying to torture those who still go to see his films? A major problem is the sympathy factor, which is that if you present us with a bunch of obnoxious people, why should we care what happens to them? And why should we continue to watch the film? After the first fifteen minutes, it became like bad background music to me.But then we are transported back to the 'roaring twenties.' So now we have a 'time machine' thing going on, somewhat reminiscent of 'The Purple Rose of Cairo.' What's interesting is how this undermines the film entirely, because it points to how bound to a particular cultural milieu most of us are (perhaps all of us are but not all of us can admit it). For example, how many of you can imagine Allen at an Occupy Wall Street protest (just one!), or even a Tea Party one? He's still living with childhood notions he was exposed to in the 40s and 50s, and his young adult musings and disappointments of the 60s and 70s, apparently. Overall, this movie reminded me most of the Carousel of Progress attraction at Disney World (last time I was there was in the early 1980s), and not a serious film.If you can't bring yourself to say it, I will say it for you; I am done with Allen. And I am willing to admit that when I was younger I looked down upon friends who weren't interested in his movies. The neurotic 'every man' (who also doesn't seem to exist in my experience) is of no interest, other than psychologically. To some degree, I found this film depressing, like going to a gallery opening and realizing that the work of the artist being displayed demonstrates that he is clearly past his prime, and that he is searching, unsuccessfully, to try to be 'new' and 'fresh.' Allen seems to lack cinematic empathy; everyone is seen through the eyes of the main character, who may deserve the 'problems' he faces, for all we know. Ask yourself, what if Woody had lost all his money in a Madoff-like Ponzi scheme in 2008? Would he have made this film (assuming he could get funding) a year or two later? I really wonder if he can't address socio-economic issues (beyond having one of his obnoxious characters make an obnoxious remark about them) because he thinks he is far superior to the 'little people' of the world.And what is the 'underlying message' here? That one should live in one's own time? Does one have a choice? If you are a multi-millionaire like Allen perhaps you do! The rest of us have plenty of 'reality' to deal with that is of this time. But putting that aside, Allen seems to have been trying to be 'cute,' allowing a person of today who is captivated by a Parisian 'golden age' to meet the famous people of that age in person via a time travel conceit. This might have worked, at least to some degree, if the Wilson character had some of his illusions shattered by meeting these 'greats' in person. Instead, the interactions are very soft and uninteresting. This film has the appearance of being made by someone who was able to do whatever he wanted, and was not willing to accept any criticism (and certainly had no interest in seeking any). Nice 'work' if you can get it !But let me end this with a critique that is 'universal.' As I mentioned above, I want to know the main characters' back story when I see a film. Otherwise, for all we know, the Wilson character is basically immature and not ready for a relationship. Allen doesn't seem to know how to do back story, from what I've seen, but he certainly must understand the concept. If you want people to think of you as a 'professional,' if not a 'great,' then you should work on your weaknesses, but he has not, despite the huge number of films he has made. Because of this, he basically creates films that are variations on a theme, and all with the same glaring flaws. I wonder if he thinks he is doing 'something important' or if he is 'just going through the motions' to make money. The flaws are not an issue in a fast-paced, silly/absurd comedy like 'Love and Death,' nor in 'Annie Hall,' which contained plenty of good comedy (of different kinds), and had a compelling main character who was rather simple, though genuine, namely Annie (whose family we got to see), and therefore requires less of a back story. She was the best 'every man' in any Allen film, though he keeps wanting his audiences to view him that way.",2,21,37,21 December 2011
Taxi Driver," This Emperor has an obvious 'wardrobe malfunction.'
","So many have told us this is a great movie, if not one of the greatest. Why? At the beginning, we are introduced to a man, Travis Bickle. who is behaving in a kind of infantile way. We have no idea why. Is he new to the city? All we really ever learn is that he was in the Marines, honorably discharged, and he thinks New York City is filthy, disgusting, etc. Why? The cinematography actually makes the city look vibrant and dynamic. I was there, at the time, though not quite an adult yet, and never got the sense that it was a filthy, disgusting place, despite my parents' somewhat paranoid attitudes. Granted, I did not travel all over Manhattan, as a taxi driver might, but that just compels the viewer to ask why he is in New York in the first place, let alone driving a taxi there!When Iris talks about going to a commune in Vermont, he says that it's not the kind of place for him. What is? Yes, we understand he is 'disturbed,' but we are given no clue as to why, which creates a frustrating quality to this film. We get quite a bit of cozy music (which sometimes goes 'dark') with the wonderful cinematography, and in general the city appears quite interesting, and not especially dangerous. Why weren't there several scenes of violent crime? Was prostitution only occurring in Manhattan at that time? There is a kind of self-contradictory quality to this film that irritates, and there is not even an attempt to resolve it. A glaring example of this is the long scene with Iris and her pimp; what are we meant to infer from it? It almost seems like Scorsese wants us to think that the 'bad' New Yorkers aren't really that bad. If so, it contradicts the apparent point of the film. If not, why was it not cut out of the film?We do see some characters that represent the more 'positive' side of New York, including the politician, Charles Palantine, and one of his campaign workers, Betsy. Does New York appear to them the way it does to Travis? For the most part, if they are concerned with someone who might do them harm, it is Travis, not the people he regards as 'scum.' This is where the movie could have gone, and it would have been consistent with society, especially the 'white flight' of that era. We would see that less educated, more 'ethnic,' 'white' people had become nearly paranoid with stories about fictions, such as the 'black snipers of Newark,' for example. We could then see the politician character fanning the flames of such fear, perhaps prompting Travis to do something violent. We could get flashbacks and find out that Travis sees Palantine as a surrogate father. Those kinds of scenes could provide some grounding (social and psychological) to this film. It would be a shocking twist for us to think that Palantine is taking Travis under his wing, only to find out that he is trying to use Travis to further his political ambitions, and at that point, with the cozy music turning 'dark,' an actual drama might just arise !I like the idea of the world as seen through the eyes of a troubled man, so I don't object to this approach, but the audience needs some idea of why that person is the way he is (and you can't put in scenes that don't include that character, such as the one with Iris and her pimp). As it stands, this is a confused film. It's like the cinematographer went ahead and made his film while the director was making a contrary one. The soundtrack seems like an attempt to bring the two together, but it doesn't work because we haven't been shown enough contrast between 'good' and 'bad' New York, and too much is seen from the perspective of a character who seems seriously disturbed and clearly paranoid, for some unknown reason. And astute viewer might assume that it may be about racial strife, if we consider the recent history, circa the mid 1970s. Perhaps Scorsese just took that for granted, but there are ways of making your ideas known with subtlety, and Scorsese was unwilling or unable to do that here, for whatever reason. I think of an unfinished Old Master portrait when I think of this film, only with the background finished rather than the head !",3,15,30,2 February 2012
Shutter Island," Just watch the original 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' instead.
","Tedious and boring most of the time, interspersed with gore and irritating music. What was the point of this film, really? Was it meant to entertain mostly teenagers, because the presentation was so over the top that M. Night Shayamalan will probably blush when he sees it? It was a psychological drama without any psychological depth. Leo was again cast in a role that was not right for him. What was needed was someone to physically embody the emotional turmoil the character had endured. And the flashbacks only make the intelligent viewer ask the obvious question, which is, why should we care so much about this one person's troubles when all those people were killed by the Nazis (or survived with their horrible memories)? That was an idiotic thing to include in this film, totally undermining it. Scorsese tried to do way too much here. He could've tried to do a 'modern' version of 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,' for example. Then ending also didn't make sense to me, and was almost an endorsement of suicide, though considering how this impressed me as 'career suicide,' perhaps it makes some sort of ironic sense.",3,57,117,20 February 2010
Captain America: The First Avenger," Where is the MST 3K trio when you need them most?
","Another reviewer said this started strong. I had difficulty staying awake after a few minutes of this film. It basically fails on every level. The only way it 'succeeds' is if the viewer is seeking a 'feel good' pastiche of all the excellent major actions films preceding it, and doesn't care about quality or originality. Who is this movie meant to entertain, I wondered? I hope even our children will find this unworthy of note - at least that would be a hopeful sign for the future!I must say that I did have some fun thinking of what Joel and the 'robot friends' might say if they were watching this insipid, sometimes laughably bad film. But look on the bright side, if your kids are of a certain age they might beg you to get them steroids so that they too can have the body of a 'superhero.' In the world of 'Captain Avenger,' I guess ~insert your favorite steroid infused baseball player's name here~ would be President! And a movie about that person would likely be a considerably more interesting experience than this film, which is more comical (in a pathetic way) than comic book!Add a star or two if you are a big fan of a ludicrous rewriting of history or an outright silly use of special effects, this may for you. However, for me, Captain Generica or Geriatrica is mostly what this movie felt like. 'Vat ver you expecting, da Matreex?'",Null,13,32,26 July 2011
The Shining," Potential for greatness ruined by the 'auteur' mindset?
","That's mostly how I view this film. First off, it's too long, meaning it didn't need to be this long. There have been many interpretations of the symbolism and inconsistencies in the film but the major problem for me is the psychic ability element. All three family members see ghosts, so why is there a need for psychic ability? How does that contribute anything, other than to be make us have to suspend more disbelief that is required? Thus, there is clearly a 'lack of economy'' here.This is exacerbated by being told that another family had been in a similar position in the recent past and was murdered by the father/husband. Again, why is this important? It could be, if we are to think that ghosts were responsible, but then are we supposed to believe that one member of that family had psychic ability too? Instead, psychic ability should have been omitted entirely from the film, and then hearing about the previous caretaker family would 'play better,' because we can believe, in the context of a film at least, that ghosts were responsible.Or, we could have the child's psychic ability being the portal to the ghost world at the hotel (with no need for Hallorann's psychic ability, which just makes things less believable). Then we should not be told of a previous caretaker who killed his family. Instead, this film possessed a bit of a 'let's throw it all at the wall and see what sticks' quality to it, which is it's major flaw, IMO. Towards the end, one is thinking, are extraterrestrial aliens going to make an appearance soon? How about 'bigfoot?' I'll bet he's a little jealous by now!What does this film do very well? The repeating maze theme is excellent, compelling the viewer to ask what the point of it is. The ghost theme works, and in fact is two ghost stories rather than one. The 'whites' of the early 1920s are trapped in a kind of purgatory, where they essentially dance on the graves of native Americans. They still have their racist (and other nasty) attitudes, and are stuck in that maze of evil until they are presumably finally relegated to Hell, where they belong.In the meantime, people like Jack are sucked into their world, perhaps aided by alcoholism in his case. For me it was a case of deincarnation (my term, AFAIK), and his frozen body shows what happens to those who allow others to tell them how to think; they no longer grow and get stuck in past notions that have been rejected by history, so to speak. So, there is a bit of clutter in the middle of this film that could (and should IMO) have been omitted, but overall it was an excellent idea for a 'ghost story,' with appropriate symbolism (for the most part), cinematography, etc.",7,0,2,12 November 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Verbose, ornate, scattered, and unappealing, but otherwise...
","It seems as though the idea was to cram as much into this film as possible, with predictable results. For example, was there a need to appeal to people who like 'Mission Impossible' type movies? And mysteries that go back to Sherlock Holmes, if not beyond that? And Lara Croft kinds of things? Are you into S&M? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Did you enjoy 'The Boys From Brazil?' What about Abby from 'NCIS?' You like her, right? She's in here too !Because of this muddle (though it's quite stylish), it's hard to feel much for the characters - it's just not realistic to have all these elements come together at one moment in time. I would have liked some backstory on Lisbeth, and I would have given up the murder mystery, the social worker who was a despicable torturing rapist, and a few other things, to get it. Then there are all the sex scenes, because I guess the 'soft core' crowd needed to get their 'beaks wet' too, right? And then there is all the talking. It's almost like the director wanted the audience to begin to nod off before the next 'exciting' thing happened, so that they wouldn't realize what a ludicrous concoction this is !The sad thing is that it appeared that everything was available to make an excellent film here. Why not focus on the Lisbeth character? Oh, then the 'masses' wouldn't be satisfied because it wouldn't be a 'Hollywood Blockbuster' film, right? Are you sure? I think times might be changing, and if so, this might be regarded as a kind of cinematic dinosaur in the near future ! I often find myself hoping that reviewers would explain what he/she would have done differently if that person doesn't like the film.So, here is my idea: I'll take the basic idea, though make the 'bigger story' one of simple government corruption, not an elaborate murder mystery. Lisbeth can keep her motorcycle, tattoos, nose rings, etc., but she is not a computer genius. You'll see flashbacks of how she was abused during her childhood. Though she is living as a lesbian, she finds herself drawn to Blomkyist, and there is at least some sexual component to it. There is obvious tension about this, and that is the major thought-provoking aspect to the film. That is, she finds a man (I'd cast someone a bit younger) who is the opposite of what she is used to, and she reconsiders her sexuality. I would have created an ambiguous ending, but in the DVD age, I'd also create a few others and let viewers make what they wish of them.Note: I did see the original too, and perhaps because it felt more 'foreign,' the believability issue seemed less noticeable, but I also thought that it needed to be 'slimmed' down and given more focus. This screams out for mini-series treatment, but I guess there's a lot less money involve in that kind of project.",4,9,18,6 January 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wow, this is the cutest ugly/mean film I've ever seen !
","I've really enjoyed some of Anderson's films, and even 'Moonrise Kingdom,' which wasn't good, had some thought-provoking qualities. This one, by contrast, was awful, and to me it suggests he has become 'full of himself' or is 'mailing it in.' It's not funny, nor insightful, nor compelling on any level. At the very beginning, the worn, 1960s decor was amusing, and overall I got the sense that this was going to be about a small number of 'quirky' hotel guests in the mid 1980s. These were people who were trapped in the past, but didn't know how to move forward because they had enough money to keep them at the 'luxury resort hotel.' I was really looking forward to that kind of presentation, but instead we are then taken to another flashback !We are then introduced to a 'lobby boy' and a hotel manager (who is 'full of himself' and rather unappealing) who are living during the heyday of the hotel, several decades earlier. Now I'm thinking that this still might be about quirky hotel guests, but of a different period, and seen through the eyes of these two (or at least one of them). Instead, the film degenerates into a ridiculous plot about the manager (Fiennes) being framed for murder, then plotting to escape, then trying to clear his name. Not long after he does this, he is killed by Nazi-like soldiers (why couldn't they be actual Nazi soldiers?). The lobby boy's wife dies in childbirth, along with the child, for no good reason, and we have to be told that this happens - we don't see the lobby boy and his wife as a married couple (so there is no character development).There are a few crude jokes, and several murders, one of a cat that seemed like it was something from a 'Beavis and Butthead' episode. Overall, this was a very unpleasant cinematic experience, and even the special effects, which tried to create a cute and 'magical' atmosphere, did not fit in well - some were used over and over again, to the point of being irritating. If you are not going to create realistic characters, then there needs to be something compelling. The special effects certainly don't make up for this shortfall, as can be the case in action or sci-fi movies, nor is there anything in the plot that works, such as an elaborate murder mystery. It's not even a 'feel good' film with a message about 'personal redemption' or 'doing the right thing.'Now I'm all for 'dark' films about subjects like 'losing faith' (which often contain insights one can't help but ponder), yet you're not going to get anything like that here either! As my title suggests, this is a bizarre 'cute' yet mean and nasty effort, and I gave it an extra star because it's outright weird, conceptually. I was not impressed by 'Moonrise Kingdom,' but I think I understood the 'coming of age' idea behind it; with this film, I am left wondering what Anderson was trying to accomplish. If you enjoy this film, that's fine with me, though I have no idea what you could have found compelling or humorous, but if you think it's some sort of contribution to the history of cinema, I think you would benefit from taking some college courses on this subject. If you are a fan of old, silly-looking decor, go ahead and watch the first ten minutes, but after that, I can't imagine what anyone could enjoy about it, other than a few seconds here or there.",2,36,73,3 June 2014
Django Unchained," This movie confirms Tarantino's brilliance, and it's dreadful.
","I'll get to the heart of the matter. 'Reservoir Dogs' was spot on. It was a realistic (in terms of the outcome) yet highly stylized gangster film. It said to the viewer, 'I know you are expecting X, Y, and Z, but isn't it time you 'grew up' already? Do you want to see the same movie over and over again?' 'Bad guys' do bad things and usually self-destruct in one way or another at a young age. We saw that no matter how hard one might try, you cannot polish a turd, as they say.Despite the cute dialogue, these guys are bad, do bad things, and the results are bad. If that heist would have 'succeeded,' they just would have gotten themselves killed or jailed some other way. it was a 'wake up call,' an inversion, or perhaps the best way to think of it is that it wasn't what it seemed to be. It was just a bunch of 'simulacra' thrown together to resemble a feature-length film. It succeeded brilliantly, but Tarantino had nowhere to go after that, other than to stylize and fabricate as much as possible, creating ludicrous, absurd movies that had no point. If you saw one you didn't need to see another.'Django Unchained' is more of a postscript. It's not as ridiculous or as historically inaccurate as it could have been, but even it if had been, what would it have mattered? He's been there and done that, and apparently can't figure out what to do now other than to repeat the past. He is in the 'Woody Allen Zone' at this point (just substitute the 'white,' rich, self-absorbed complainers for retro and homicidal, yet more 'diverse' and colorful characters in Tarantino's last several films), in my opinion, meaning that he's 'mailing it in' for the money. The movie is too long and very quickly the viewer can predict the kinds of things that will transpire. I don't play violent video games (or any video games at all), but after watching this I was thinking that it would be much more interesting in every way to just do that; after perhaps twenty minutes (or less) I'd get my fill of this sort of thing and could use the other two hours and change to do something 'productive.'The following is my highly speculative, 'inside the mind' history (or is it an anti-history) of Tarantino's 'MO:' After 'Reservoir Dogs,' he had one last idea, essentially the end of the 'Hollywood Blockbuster' disguised as a Hollywood Blockbuster (an anti-Hollywood Blockbuster?). It would be a highly stylized, very violent move that would appear to have several compelling 'back stories.' The reality is that it had none, and once the viewer figures this out, he or she should tell himself/herself that there is no reason to watch such films any longer, other than as some sort of 'cheap chill,' basically 'violence porn.' That blockbuster, of course, was 'Pulp Fiction.'The title 'gave away' the director's thoughts: 'stop watching my films if you are an intelligent, empathetic person.' Of course you may have watched one or two more because you couldn't be sure, but at this point his movies are some sort of 'post-modern,' anti-film, non-story. Watch them, expecting something different, and as they say, the joke is on you. Instead, I suggest you consider taking a course on the history of film, film criticism, or something along those lines. Seeing 'Django' is like being the 'best' guest at a 'dinner for schmucks.' So, I guess the most interesting question now is, what do we make of a reviewer who realizes what is occurring yet still feels compelled to watch these anti-films in order to tell others not to be the butt of a joke? Is this an anti-review? A 'pulp' review?",2,150,283,6 January 2013
Kick-Ass," It's not easy to assess this one !
","This had the potential to be a great film, but it went astray, especially the ending. However, let me start at the beginning. The portrayal of a geeky high school guy wanting to become a 'super hero' and learning, 'the hard way,' that it isn't very realistic (and quite dangerous) is fairly well done. It paves the way perfectly for the real 'super heroes,' who are a bit mentally imbalanced, to put it nicely. The bloody and gruesome, yet comical scene of Hit Girl killing a bunch of thugs and low-lifes is the high point of the film. The problem then becomes where to go from there.First I'll talk about the issues I had with the actual film, then I'll offer an alternative idea. There were too many characters who were given enough time to get the audience interested in them, yet not enough time to do anything else. None of the characters were 'developed' to a sufficient degree for me, actually. At the end, we are asked to believe that Hit Girl has no 'emotional scars' and can just be a 'normal' child. I would have at least changed that ending so that when confronted by bullies who want her lunch money (I would have made the bullies girls rather than boys), she just gives it to them as says something like, 'no problem; remember that violence never solves anything.' However, I would prefer to see the film go in a very different direction after Hit Girl's first scene of slaughter. Big Daddy and Hit Girl talk about Kick-Ass and decide that they should mentor him, or at least make him realize that he's going to get himself killed at some point, because they won't be there to come to the rescue every time he gets himself into trouble. They take him on one of their missions after giving him some 'training,' and he kills a 'bad guy' who was about to kill him. When he gets back home he realizes he doesn't have the demeanor to do such things, even in the case of self defense, because he should have never put himself in that position in the first place.He develops a love interest at the same time and struggles with the violence that he will have to be exposed to if he continues on the 'super hero' path. This, in combination with his self defense killing, leads him not only to quit, but to think about how he can rescue Hit Girl from her father's indoctrination. He gets to know her a bit and realizes she has no social skills nor any other interest in life. It is a 'sick' relationship she has with her obsessed father. He contacts social services and tells them what's going one, and they have him wear a wire to get evidence against Big Daddy. BD discovers what KA is planning to do, and he and HG abduct KA. HG doesn't realize that BD wants to kill KA and dispose of his body so that it is never found, but HG intervenes when KA tells her about the world beyond the 'super hero' lifestyle, when BD is out doing something. So, at the end, BD is in a mental institution, HG is in school and doing well, though getting counseling, and KA is living a 'normal' life with his 'normal'-looking girl friend.",7,1,9,21 April 2010
Taken," Does it get any lower than this?
","I decided to comment after seeing this get 8.0 here on IMDb. That's a sad commentary on something in society. This movie can be summed up as 'geriatric Jean Claude.' I'll also mention that if you want to produce unbelievable nonsense like this, you should try to create characters the audience can actually care about to some degree. The key point here, though, is that everything was as unlikely as possible. The daughter just happens to be kidnapped by sex slave traders. The father just happens to be some sort of 'black ops' expert, etc. This really comes across as the fantasy (or nightmare) of a guy having a mid life crisis. I suggest buying a red corvette instead, but if you can't afford it, I guess you can always rent 'Taken.' If this is even a 'fair' movie, Bronson's 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' should have cleaned up at the Oscars! I won't waste any more of my time on this.",1,27,59,1 February 2009
12 Years a Slave," If you can't stand the heat... (slaves didn't have that choice).
","To those who don't like seeing what the reality was like, I advise you to just take a moment and imagine if you had been a slave: 'there but for the grace of God go I.' Or have you not heard of that one? If you have a legitimate criticism about the film, that's fine. I too was wondering about Solomon's 'back story,' and it's certainly possible he was a bit of a 'sketchy character.' To cite that possibility as a reason to dismiss his ordeal, however, demonstrates a lack of humanity. Instead, I would like the director to have figured out a way to make that less conspicuous.In fact, I would rather have seen a different ex-slave's account as the basis for this kind of film. Or what about the subject being one of the major slave rebellions? We could have been shown what plantation life was like first, and then the audience would have to ponder some intriguing questions. Tension could have been built up effectively, whereas here Solomon is rescued with little drama. While this doesn't detract from his account, it does suggest a more creative cinematic approach should have been employed. And while this film is actually not nearly as 'graphic' as it could have been, in terms of what some slaves experienced, there isn't much in the way of 'sugar coating,' and in a sense the brutality becomes the focus of the film. Perhaps because of this, it leaves a somewhat scattered impression.Unlike some critics here, I like the nature shots, and wish there would have been a better use of the scenery. If you don't have an idea of what that might accomplish, I suggest watching 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God.' And while it's certainly true there wasn't 'much in the way of 'comic relief,' there didn't need to be. Instead, a more documentary style could have been adopted, and if so, odd or ridiculous mannerisms or situations could have supplied some kind of a break to the brutality presented. Again, the best movie I've seen that succeeds with this approach is 'Aguirre...' Some of the things I really liked about this film included the sort of psychodrama aspect to living in this kind of society, as well as the physical proximity that often existed between slave owners and the slaves. It's almost like the slave owners felt the need to think that they controlled the minds of their slaves, though they might say that the slaves did not possess fully human minds. This film does a good job on these accounts. If you want to learn more, I suggest the book, 'Honor and Violence in the Old South,' though I am not claiming I agree with everything the author argues. And of course there are the primary sources ('slave narratives').Some of the things I really liked about this film included the sort of psychodrama aspect to living in this kind of society, as well as the physical proximity that often existed between slave owners and the slaves.

Whiplash," Searching for Gene Krupa ?
","I'm giving this a 5, but it's important to explain that the reason is that I think it will please those who like these kinds of films and/or will enjoy the jazz. I agree with those who have pointed out that there were too many drill sargent/basic training type scenes, and while professional musicians put in a lot of practice time, what was portrayed here way way over the top. The Simmons character in particular was played with an almost sadistic quality (and little else to his personality), but for me that detracted greatly. I would like to have had some 'backstory' on the two main characters, but instead it's just the same sort of thing, over and over again, with at least a mildly unrealistic ending that put it in the 'Karate Kid' category.At least in 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' we were compelled to ask if children should experience that kind of stress on a regular basis, but what's the essence of this film? Does it matter if this young man becomes a 'great' drummer? I really don't care one way of the other. For all I know he is a rather nasty person who deserves to fail - nothing in the film suggested to the contrary! How can such a film me made with such obvious flaws? If it was made in someone's back yard with basically no budget, the story would be understandable, but it isn't here!",5,10,22,6 January 2015
Prometheus," The most 'alien' creatures are the humans!
","I wrote up a long review but it's too long for IMDb guidelines, though after reading some of the other reviews I see that just about everything I wrote is covered, so I'll instead try to write up a summation of the major problems with this film.1. The humans act in ways that are just not believable, unless the mission was organized intentionally to include stupid, uncaring, nasty people (depending upon which one) that any unbiased member of the audience will not be able to empathize with. Perhaps the worst example of this, though I'm not even sure, is at the end when an archaeologist tells the captain to crash his ship into an alien ship, which will mean he would die. I would have told the archaeologist, who previously had answered a scientific question with the response, 'because I want to believe' (or something like that), while clutching the Christian crucifix pendant she was wearing, that I thought she might be delusional. Sorry Mrs. Fox Mulder, your beliefs do not warrant doing something like that (and how does Christianity view suicide?)!2. The 'science' is either ridiculous or it's not clear what the audience is being asked to believe. Other than things already pointed out (that I've read) how is the Shaw character supposed to not die from internal bleeding after a major operation was performed on her abdomen/uterus and she is kicked hard right where the incision was made, flung through the air, lasting hard on the ground, and must've dealt with a massive shock wave from a huge spaceship crashing right next to her?3. Generally, everything was poorly done except for the special effects. The worst is a muddled plot with apparent allusions to Christianity that is so internally inconsistent as to make one wonder if each paragraph was written by a different writer who didn't have any idea what the person before him or her wrote. Moreover, this film can't even manage to be concise. For example, did the Vickers character add anything, or was she just a minor distraction? 4. Presumably, the audience is supposed to ponder 'big questions' while watching this film, or soon thereafter, but the film presents an absurd context for these questions. I read a reviewer over at Rotten Tomatoes say that 'Prometheus' makes you consider the possibility that a violent, destructive force created humankind. Perhaps this reviewer should read the Old Testament, in particular the commands to kill everyone in certain towns, leaving no stone unturned. At least that has context. Can someone please teach our youth basic history (not that I'm claiming that the Bible must be taken literally, but rather than such acts were viewed as acceptable by at least many people of the time if told that a supreme being demands it)?Actually, this film could have been salvaged somewhat if there had been some basic editing done and if the Holloway character would not have been killed off, at least until the very end, so that he could have answered Shaw's 'deep' question by pointing out to her that her Christianity is too focused on the 'nice' aspects of the New Testament, and that she should have taken the Pentateuch more seriously. I would expect a student in his or her first year of film school to do a better job, again, except for the special effects. I was amazed at how awful it was; it gave me the impression that this was a 'mail it in' type effort, for whatever reason.",2,6,10,9 June 2012
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Stiff, unappealing, unimaginative... where did old Woody go?
","Some have commented about the use of a narrator. Yes, that was lazy and intrusive, but not nearly the worst part of this boring mess of a film. And I wouldn't care if Woody Allen wasn't the director and writer - at this point I just watch films for what they are, not who was involved in making them. I found myself trying to stay awake while watching it, but when it had my full attention, I found myself amazed at the flimsiness being presented. Boring, self-indulgent people walking around a beautiful city, not knowing what they really wanted out of life, not really interested in anyone or anything else, except for what it meant to themselves.And yes, Johansson's performance was quite bad, as others have mentioned, but it actually was consistent with the tone of the film, if that's in any way a 'positive.' There was a turning point, however, which I thought might save the film, at least to some degree, and that occurred when the Johansson character decided she no longer wanted to be in the menage a trois situation. When the viewer isn't given any reason for this decision, I had to laugh, because that was the final confirmation of my thoughts up to that point. Like Johansson, the paintings, which were just AbEx rip-offs, reflected the lack of overall depth the viewer is compelled to endure.These are just unappealing, narcissistic people I would not want to know. Their only goals in life concern self satisfaction, and the viewer isn't even given a reason why this is the case. Is it that Woody himself is now like this and assumes everyone else in the world is? That's really the only somewhat interesting thing that I took from this film. Unlike in some of his early films, there is no sardonic wit here, or anything else that would allow us to find something special about this. If someone else had given us this film, especially if it was a young person, I'd think that this person had a lot of 'growing up' to do. The people in this film are the kind of bit-part characters that the main characters in Woody's best films would make fun of !",2,72,114,21 December 2008
