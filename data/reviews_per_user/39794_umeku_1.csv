Source Code," True sci-fi
","This is what a true sci-fi should be. It's fun, easy to watch, but thought-provoking and intelligent. I loved 'Moon' and now, with 'Source Code', Duncan Jones became just the guy to follow, in my book.There are movies that use the sci-fi genre only to justify all those shiny SFX fireworks we all like so much. But once in a while another kind of sci-fi emerges. If you're a fan of BSG or B5 amongst others, you know the kind. The one that is about people first, and flashy exploding photo-realistic spaceships second. It can be tough to sell such a complex film to an unprepared audience, but Source Code does it brilliantly with emotion, romance, humor and top-notch performances.",9,3,5,24 December 2015
