The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," For Twihards Only..spoilers
","If you are not a Twihard or adore the books you probably will not get it. The movie is exactly what the fans wanted and the screenplay is true to the book. Bill Condon did a fabulous job. Only negative, music for the first 30 minutes is a bit cheesy-but does represent the romance. The make up was much better this movie but it was hard to watch Bella so skinny. Loved the movie, best yet. The acting has improved with each film. There were very difficult scenes to adapt but Melissa Rosenberg did it wonderfully. Even fans of the book miss a couple of details. Who actually changes Bella? Hint, its not Edward. The scene where Jacob imprints was done with such sincerity and sensitivity that it fit. The birth scene was difficult to see but the scene where Edward watches Bella get in to the bathtub was more difficult for me to watch.",10,4,15,19 November 2011
