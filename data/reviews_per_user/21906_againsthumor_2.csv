The Blair Witch Project," Requires viewer imagination
","This movie acts as an amplifier on the imagination of the viewer. If you don't have any it won't work. Another way to look at this is if you think David Blain (or what's his name, the bum turned street magician) can really float above ground you will be scared by the Blair Witch.This movie cannot really be watched more then once. Assuming you were 'impressed' by it the first time, watching it the second time will make you wonder why you were taken by it the first time. You will also see why many people think it's rubbish. It's like with the Matrix, when I saw it first, for some reason, I thought it was great. I am now embarrassed I ever said that.That all said if you do have the psychological make up (any flavor of border-line personality disorder will do) a first watch, alone can be quite scary.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The thing with getting older...
","I'm trying not to say anything that must have been said before (but I didn't read all the reviews so....)With regard to comparing the new batch of Star Wars films with the old ones; I doubt the ability of some people to understand the difference in experience between seeing a movie first when you're around 10 and seeing a movie first when you're around 30...With regard to dialog; I'm tired of these over acted stage dramas that Hollywood insist on making of every movie (probably because the old-ones that call the shots have zero imagination.) 'Phantom Menace' was a breeze in that respect. I really appreciate that. Some dialog is necessary to understand what's going on but after that every minute that a movie/TV-show shows a close up of two heads talking gets deducted from the overall score of the movie. (That's why 'As the world turns' is at the extreme low end of the spectrum)So Mr Lucas, good going... My humble suggestion; reduce on 'psycho-dialog', let the story march forth at even a higher pace, more detail without explaining (hinting and leaving things unexplained is better). Forget about character development just a few indications of what's going on will suffice in activating the imagination of the viewer. Let's face it viewer imagination is required, don't bother making movies for those people without imagination at all.Thanks for reading",Null,0,0,15 January 2003
