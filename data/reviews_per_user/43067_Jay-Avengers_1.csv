Iron Man 3," Bad Movie
","This is my first review of a movie, and writing it only to express my displeasure on the movie Iron Man 3.The movie starts with lot of promise and within minutes takes you down several levels of disappointments.I first saw Iron Man as a movie, and hence not aware of various characters that are associated with Iron Man comics. However, the villain character portrayed by Kingsley (The Mandarin) starts off great, only to be reduced to a buffoon in the end. Such a shame.The plot is filled with loopholes, like why Iron Man lets his army of robots stay put while his villa is being destroyed. (The scene of destruction is top class though).No reasons why Maya suddenly changes her mind, and most importantly why is Pepper doing action in the end, all of a sudden?A few good things - the scenes with the Kid (Harley), the final fight with Robots and Downey's acting is the only saving grace of the film.Better watch this on a DVD in parts rather than wasting 120+ minutes of your valuable time at a stretch.It is a big disappointment.",3,14,28,29 April 2013
