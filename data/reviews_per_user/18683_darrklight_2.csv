Raiders of the Lost Ark," A charming, well-casted, wonderfully directed adventure masterpiece...
","Terrific action adventure takes few breaths as it throws it's intrepid, globe trotting, archeologist protagonist in front of vile Nazis, giant boulders, unrelenting natives, heavy fisted baddies, and even snakes. Adventurer extraordinaire Indiana Jones is hired by the Government to find and attain the mystical Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do and along the way encounters everything from risk of loss of limb to a little romance in this adventure set in the late 30's.  Ford embodies charismatic Jones like no other could and pairs up nicely with Allen, who plays the damsel not-so-much in distress. Rounding out the cast is the impeccable John Rhys-Davies as Indy's faithful and charming friend Sallah and Paul Freeman lends an almost charming fiendishness to the antagonist Belloq. The film score, by the legendary Williams, is one of the finest film scores ever and compliments perfectly every twist, turn, and tumble this film has to offer. First action piece should be reading material for film students on how to hook an audience within ten minutes. A giant film from which all other adventure films should be rated. Spielberg weaves his greatest movie magic and comes up with a truly memorable and fun movie that reminds you of the type of films that unfortunately aren't made anymore. A true 'popcorn' movie...",10,0,0,11 September 2001
Memento," A simple story that is not-so-simply told
","Wonderfully conceived, flawlessly executed 'whodunnit' will challenge your perception and your intellect. Backwards unfolding plot is the movie's main gimmick, and inadvertently over-complicates a simple story, but works so terrifically the film probably wouldn't work the same without it. Pearce and Moss are palpable and quite effective, as is the always dependable Pantoliano as the shady supposed 'friend' of Pearce's character. This is definitely one where the viewer can't afford to look away from the action for a second. Not for those with short attention spans.",9,0,1,4 September 2001
