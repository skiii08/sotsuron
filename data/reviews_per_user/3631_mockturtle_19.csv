Walk the Line," Pan
","I didn't like it, and for good reasons, so don't read this if you don't want the film spoiled for you.'Oh, did he write the songs, too?'That is the probable reaction of many to 'Walk the Line', an appropriate title for a pedestrian 'love story' and cursory biopic. Much like the kids on 90210 that never do any homework, Johnny Cash's and June Carter's songcraft is abridged to watching them play through the finished versions of their songs haltingly in two scenes. No rough drafts, no place of inspiration, no real influences, they just sprung fully grown from the head of country music. And wasn't 'Walk the Line' written for his first wife, not June? That would have complicated things.What the film does have a lot of time for, however, is a lot of after-school special daddy problems and a 'my wife is an emasculating unsupportive shrew' domestic drama. I read somewhere that Roseanne Cash walked out of the family screening of the movie because her mother was portrayed as such a pill; but didn't she take it too hard? I mean it's just her mother up there on the screen for millions of people to boo and hiss at, right? The movie needed more oomph at that point and to show a man leaving a wife that isn't the daddy's girl of Satan might either make viewers scratch their heads orundermine their moral fiber! You'll have people everywhere getting divorced! Even more than the 50% that are right now! That is the evil that could result from showing something complex you elitist anti-flyover moonbat!We have the unexplained inspiration scenes, the death in the child scenes, the breakdown scenes, the 'baby I just need mah medicine' scene (though it does vary from Bill Clinton's medicine), the 'daddy you never loved me' scene. Get it? And throughout it all Joaquin Phoenix obviously gives one of the year's top performances, for your consideration, despite that he doesn't look much like Cash, behave like you can imagine Cash behaving (all petulance and no pride), or sound much like him. Oscar tallybots are standing by. In fact he only sounds like him in the later scenes where the tracks have been heavily produced and his tone lowered, the early unfiltered singing scenes show that he really can't sing and doesn't have the low notes. Note to future disciples of T-Bone Burnett: okay songwriter, good player, great producer, not a vocal coach.As for the script: having a family squabble in front of the Carter family would be like a young politician having a squabble in front of the Kennedy family. The Carters are shown as homey yokels, while superior in sense and sensibility to the weirdo Cash family; in reality they were and are legendary superstars and country royalty. How about a movie about them? From his IMDb profile it is apparent that the most important thing co-writer Gill Dennis has ever done is to be 'Man with Cigar' in David Lynch's 'Eraserhead.' This actually tops about everyone else involved in the movie.Reese sings nice and looks nice and isn't given much to do.Other than Shooter Jennings playing his own father, none of the people look or sound like the superstars they are playing or show any of their charisma, especially the Roy Orbison, and I didn't know that Jerry Lee Lewis grew up in Chelsea. Phoenix just isn't very good, and the problem is compounded by a sense of cockiness in how good he seems to think his performance is; he was undermined by the script from the beginning, but he could have put a little real thought into the freaking thing. He really seems to think (from his performance and his interviews) that he is a master thespian. Would that River were here to show how it's done.Best example of how it falls short: the moment we are all waiting for, when the two of them finally get together, is just tossed off, the movie has no shape. But then, none of James Mangold's movies have been very good and they have all opted for shallow psychobabble over real psychology (ummmgirl, interrupted and Identity come to mind). 'Ray' was a pretty bad movie, directed by another pretty underwhelming director, but I'd still watch it again over this. I guess it made John Carter Cash happy to see this boring generic love story up on screen, even if it isn't the real story.The best thing about this movie is the poster.By the way, I wonder how many stealth marketers plant fake independent praise on this site.",4,7,14,15 December 2005
Sucker Punch," One of the worst films I have ever seen.
","This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life.I snuck into it because I didn't want to chance spending money on it.I don't want to spend more time talking about it because that would waste more of my life, which I apparently value more than the people who worked on this movie.Terry Gilliam should find a pretext to sue him for the insulting 'Brazil' references. That's like having a Martha Graham routine referenced in a chlamydias prostitute's lapdance.Scott Glenn once said that Vertical Limit was his most fulfilling movie experience...so there's obvs something wrong with him...the rest of these people, especially Jena Malone and Carla Gugino, have to think a little harder about their position in life.",1,8,18,4 April 2011
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The Chronicles of Money-a: Jesus, Lilith and the drobe full of War
","It isn't so much what the Narnia says that is disturbing as the things that it is really saying and how that bodes for sequels and other popular entertainments.One of the first lessons learned by one of the Pevensie children is that it's okay to go home with strangers. Especially if they offer you tea. If they offer you tea then you are just ill-mannered if you don't come home with them. Mr. Tumnus has been cast much younger than in the book, and the film is chock full of very weird close up shots of peoples' faces as they change expression. This combined with the borderline coquettish way the little girl playing Lucy has been directed to act, the lulling of her to sleep and the anguished 'I'm kidnapping you,' made this scene more harrowing than anything in the recent crazy-guy-with-child-in-peril film 'Keane.' Is it really possible that people don't see how freaking creepy this sequence is? Another lesson: if you have an imagination you are a sissy boy-liar-traitor and probably have dark hair. You will betray your own family to their deaths.Another lesson: Women should shut the heck up when a man (especially one with blonde hair and blue eyes) is making a decision. They keep telling Susan not to be so smart and she keeps shrewing it up with the wrong decisions, countermanding and undermining her man/brother (did I mention that's creepy too) at the worst possible times with the worst possible decisions. When will she ever learn? As I hear there is more punishment in store for women who think they want to have ideas, or be unashamed of their strength and (gasp) sexuality. Stay tuned! And if you are a strong woman, then you are heartless, asexual andwell, ultimate evil really. Why not end it all now and save Aslan the trouble of biting your head off? Thank any lion god that in movies it doesn't matter how cool you make the good guys: evil is always cooler. Tilda Swinton walks away with it to the point where there should soon be an epidemic of cross-dressing elementary school boys trying to be as tough as she is.Another lesson: Christmas is all about presents and has bugger-all to do with Christ. As a moonbat I can't really argue with this lesson.Know ye this: Lion Christ was shaved for our sins. Yea, upon his haunches he sat, taunted by Jew and Orc alike. Verily would he have been smote and struck from the book of life by the evil Smart Woman, save that Lion Christ knew the secret to tricking her: women can't read! Huzzah! With this gnosis he laid his fuzzy head upon the pagan altar bearing the very instructions of how he would rise again on the morrow. O for a muse of fur! 'Tis a rare film where the talking beavers are more realistic than the humans. Oh, and the new age music is simply awful.Is this really what you want your children to be learning?",5,1,4,15 December 2005
Orphan," One word: Awful
","If you enjoy watching Law and Order:SUV or Criminal Minds or Hostel and you have been diagnosed as not a threat to those around you then you might enjoy 'Orphan.' A horribly made movie that isn't about the sexualization of children...but really is about that more than anything else. You can excuse it any way you want with any plot twists you want, but that is what this film is really about. I feel bad for all of the children for having to participate in this and I feel ashamed of Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard for involving themselves and eventually involving me because I watched it because they were in it. Little kids participating in murder and wanted to participate in sex, no matter what excuse you give, is sick exploitative $#!t.Oh and it also was not scary.",2,6,13,1 April 2011
Insomnia," Plug and Chug ***spoilers ahoy!***
","***This contains spoilers and foul language, viewer discretion is advised***Plug and Chug.How quaint.  Finally at the end of a movie with big stars and apparent backing and the studio's blessing to go forth and be a bit artsy, the Hero dies.  Unfortunately, the movie is a remake of a film where the great thing about the ending is that the hero DOESN'T die.  Christopher Nolan makes a case that `Memento' was just a fluke.  That's pretty ironic, considering that I found `Memento' a step down from his conceptually superior if less stylish debut, `Following.'  In 'Memento' there is a whole thing with Carrie-Anne Moss sending Guy Pearce after her ex-boyfriend.   It leads nowhere and leaves the spectator feeling justifiably cheated.  The worst thing about it is the superiority underlying, the feeling that he was just going to catch your attention with the birdie while he took your wallet, that you weren't going to notice that he didn't put in the time to tie this thing that takes up about 15 minutes of the movie to any sort of thematic arc, that you're being had, that Nolan is pretending to respect you, pretending that you can divide decimals in your head but really he doubts your simple addition.  Again in 'Insomnia' he pretends he's giving us the credit to make up our own minds. When people hear a movie they like is being remade with big names the oldest cliché is that they will futz with the ending, and 'Insomnia' is the cliché-maker's dream come true, the ULTIMATE in Hollywood obvious sell-out endings.  We even have the sweeping music and the cradled head and the `hang on, don't leave me, don't let go.'  And what exactly are we being told in `Insomnia' is anything outside every week at the cinema?  Nolan intercutting shots of Pacino looking disoriented with shots of events real and imagined for seconds and milliseconds accompanied by jarring music.  One can't help think that the boy must be on to something.  This will obviously spark a revolution in cinema.  As with `The Insider' and `Any Given Sunday,' one feels that the film could cut half an hour of Al Pacino (make that an hour for `Sunday'), not that he's particularly anything or another (why is he from the Italian Bayou, by the way?).  Robin Williams mistakes underplaying for playing (and looks like he's had work done) and the great and underused Martin Donovan is fine, underused and miscast in a part better suited to Aaron Eckhart (I mention because the character's name IS Eckhart).  Hilary Swank fails to register until she begins to grate near the end, mostly the script's fault.  Nicky Katt has to play a romantic lead or a kid with a pet he loves or SOMETHING or he'll soon wind up just another a__hole of the week, no offense but isn't this his 8th a__hole part?  He and Martin Donovan should defect back to indieworld, I'm sure Hal Hartley or Richard Linklater could mix up something worthwhile.  Oh, and Maura Tierney gets paid, which is always a good thing; although really, not for very much.I only wonder why they didn't nail together a cross from the abundant wood scrap on the dock where happens the film's climactic shootout (what's that? The original with Stellan Skarsgard which was so good it is ALREADY out on Criterion didn't have a big western shootout with catch phrases like `Hey Will, you forgot about the wild card [bang!]'???)  Really, this film sets the cause of making major movies not crap back somewhat, as its wholesale embrace of blatant whoredom makes the case that if you're mad because it was simply smarter/better the way it was done originally, you are just being anti-commercial and neo-bohemian for the sake of poseurship, because LOOK! Christopher Nolan has been proclaimed as a Genuine Artiste by the Wood itself, and if you think that sacrifices his credibility, the song goes, then you're the one who'll be stuck trying to trade your home-made digital movies on the web in 20 years and ranting about giving a demographic a chance to buy something other than pablum.  Maybe we should get Nolan a cross too.  It's a sucker bet, and it's no real surprise that Soderbergh produced it.  Again, the illusion of pushing boundaries with none of the effects, risks or rewards of actually pushing boundaries.So it's right there on the poster: three academy awards and the new hot guy and we still can't get a good ending or any honest to god moral ambiguity. Williams goes bonkers and (as you know from the preview) tries to off Swank in a completely unjustifiable move (she's told everyone where she's going! He's a mystery writer!) and Pacino decides that he should give the nickel back to Mr. Wilson even if he's going to be grounded for two whole weeks. Pacino certainly took Olivier's advice to Dustin Hoffman about acting like he's tired, by the end of the movie you'll swear he hasn't slept since `Dog Day Afternoon.' The cinematography was nicely handled by Wally Pfister, so the evening wasn't a complete waste. But sing it loud and if you're going to sing it then sing it proud, SELL OUT!",Null,1,1,26 May 2002
Juno," Heart overcomes quirk OD
","I'm writing to provided some much needed balanced criticism. 99% of the reviews here are OMG! Or totally hating.Let's dismiss the main hater point: The dialogue is not realistic, 'nobody talks like that!' I'm sorry, but you'll have to point me to the carven letters on the tablets of screen writing that Robert McKee brought down from the Griffith Park Observatory in the Hollywood Hills to find the hoi-polloi worshiping the fake-golden skin of pornstars that say that your dialogue has to be realistic. If you want realistic dialogue go have a conversation, you'll see how exciting it is.Now the good things: Ellen Page is radiant and perfect. All of the performances are top-notch across the board but it's obviously a starmaker for her. She brings out the vulnerability behind each of the tough stances and snappy remarks. Michael Cera is also perfect and hilariously ill-at-ease as the pursued ('whose idea was it?'). J.K. Simmons and Alison Janney do solid, sensitive and funny work as parents that are much more fiercely protective and supportive than their easy demeanor might suggest. The baby-belly is very realistic, too, so props to props.Now the problems: Really what we have here is an okay script saved by excellent direction and performances. It obviously is frontloaded with too much quirk, but it helps that many of those early lines are actually funny. However, most of the heart that makes the whole thing worthwhile is provided by the actors and not the script. Paulie Bleeker has almost no distinguishing characteristics, there's no reason for Juno to be in love with himexcept that it's Michael Cera. See what I mean? With even just a passable cast this would have been a disaster of the-kid-in-Little-Miss-Sunshine-wore-a-fatsuit proportions. The area that is not saved is the portrayal of the couple (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). Bateman's performance gives the character a dignity that is completely lacking in the script, which uses him mainly as a joke aboutArrested Development. Oy. And he almost raises his son's kid, in TV-Movie cross-pollination. Anyway, it portrays the way Jennifer Garner's character freezes him completely out of the relationship and makes him live all of the parts of his life that matter to him in basements and closets as second to the outrage of HOW COULD HE NOT WANT A BABY??? It refuses to take his character seriously, as evidenced by his come-on to Juno, which crosses a line of reality. He's a guy that has compromised his dreams and is actually contributing, he's not some burnout, but they treat him like a stuck-in-the-90's joke. Then on the other side is Garner's character, a psychotic frigid control freak we're supposed to believe is going to be the best mother ever. I pity that kid and the incarceration that lies before it. The film seems to prefer a strange idea of a relationship and adulthood, where you get rid of anything you care about, live only for cheesecake colored paint, and if you don't you might be the sort of person that tries to mack it to a pregnant 16 year-old.What is up with these baby saviors? Solondz should have released 'Palindromes' this year.Also: Diablo Cody (the stupidest name I've ever heard) is so disingenuous when she claims not to have ambition; she's obviously made of it. Plus: David Bowie wrote 'All the Young Dudes,' bears mentioning? In the end, this shows how good Jason Reitman really is (huzzah nepotism). I enjoyed and was invested in the film as it was happening, it was only later it began to bother me, but still whoever put it there 'Juno' has a lot of heart and that's what carries the film.",7,2,10,26 December 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Quite good, but not in comparison to the stage version.
","1 - I can see how if you don't know Sondheim or this show how this film could blow your mind, and then you get to go see the DVD of the Hearn/Lansbury and find out it's even better (they should advertise that DVD). That said I have many quibbles, but one big point: they should have dropped 'By The Sea' and included 'Kiss Me' because without it A) You only see the lovers as a distraction and nuisance B) You miss out on the character of Johanna. Surprise surprise for people that have seen the movie and not the play, Johanna is an interesting character! Actually, a good production of this show will imply that she is as damaged in her own way as her parents. Cut lyrics: 'Are you discussing or fussing/Or simply dreaming?/Are you crowing?/Are you screaming?' Then they show she's a hysteric at another point, and then she kills someone but I won't ruin that. But with the movie treating them as a nuisance and plot device there is a big hole.2  Cutting the Judge's song was regrettable, but I was more disappointed in Timothy Spall's shallow Mad Hatter take on the Beadle. It really has made me appreciate the recent Broadway revival performance by Alexander Gemignani that much more, he really made that character pop. I've never seen Tobias as a boy before, he's usually an idiot man-child, it was interesting but restrictive.3  Having Sweeney as a tenor (and a rock tenor at that) created an imbalance, everybody except the Judge had a thin, reedy voice, I felt like I might get a nosebleed. Bonham-Carter's voice especially did not live up to the large orchestrations behind it, the discrepancy during 'The Worst Pies in London' was very jarring.4  By the Sea  yes it was funny, and I especially appreciated the opening image with a Seurat homage in the background, but you already had Pirelli for comic relief and we needed more character for Johanna instead. Also, again, they cut the best lyrics: By the sea, in our nest, we could share our kippers/With the odd payin' guest from the weekend trippers,/Have a nice sunny suite for the guest to rest in,/Now and then, you could do the guest in! 5  I would have liked Depp's accent more if anyone else had the same one.6  the endingwhy would you choose to go out with a whimper instead of a bang? 7  positive things: The theater was packed, so kudos. The extreme gore that wasn't even a requirement was delightful, I was very impressed that instead of sugar coating it and allowing us to become complicit he instead made their actions more repellent and distanced us from the two of them at every occasion, especially with Sweeney, it was a brave choice. As I said above, these are quibbles, I'm glad they made the movie and that it's a success.",7,1,6,26 December 2007
Capote," Brother's Keeper?
","Capote has two and a half problems.1) It is never addressed that, while declaiming autobiographical fiction and then writing a non-fiction book in which he was highly involved but deleted the biographical element, that his friend Harper Lee's book 'To Kill a Mockingbird' not only was autobiographical, but included Truman Capote himself as a character (Dill).2) It is never addressed what punishment Capote believed was fitting for the two killers: the question of whether Capote's final reluctance to get another lawyer for the killers may have been because he initially did that to guarantee a fair trial and then, a fair trial having been conducted, did not see any reason to further the possibility that they would escape a deserved punishment because of a technicality. The basis of the appeal was 'Inadequate Counsel,' Capote provided them with adequate counsel and they lost. I am not saying that they deserved death, or that Mr. Capote was for or against the death penalty, only that after a certain point he perhaps felt the State had decided their punishment fairly and had no wish to further contest that. It still wouldn't invalidate his own personal crisis.Â½) For shorthand's sake, sometimes Capote the character has to be less subtle in his manipulation than he undoubtedly was at the time.Apart from that it is possibly the best film so far this year. Expertly cast, written, directed and paced, it is a measured study of a man whose intelligence pushes him towards a moral ambiguity that his core decency cannot reconcile. Like the two ciphers for Leopold and Loeb in Hitchcock's 'Rope,' Capote attempts to live as though he is above the moral classification of people as either decent and good (Harper Lee, Jack Dunphy, his lover, played by Bruce Greenwood, and lawman Alvin Dewey, played by Chris Cooper) or immoral. It is an oversimplification that he seems to find quaint, but in using Perry Smith and allowing himself to be used by him while at the same time valuing Smith's friendship and being valued, he finds that he cannot play Smith's game; he finds that he is essentially moral and that it is too late, he has already betrayed his morality. The dissonance wrecks his life.Catherine Keener, cast perfectly for the first time in her life, radiates goodness, decency, intelligence and warmth; one can see how her Harper Lee's belief in Capote could of itself be the explicit endorsement of his core decency the film wisely declines to otherwise provide. Nearly certain Oscar Nomination, and I pity Sandra Bullock to try to match this next year. Bruce Greenwood adds shadings of caution and shows how another essentially moral, decent person can chafe and bristle, can be a complicated human and not just a box of sunshine. That and his expert projection of a lack of neediness are what make his attraction for Capote apparent. Chris Cooper can't win an Oscar for this film, but only because the part is too peripheral to the story; if there had been opportunity for more involvement (denied by history and therefore unrewriteable) he would have walked off with the show. The character is one of his best since 'Matewan' and could merit another movie: The Adventures of Alvin Dewey, of course. Bob Balaban is dependably excellent. Clifton Collins, Jr., is quite serviceable as Perry Smith, but I sometimes had the feeling that he was deliberately blurring lines and obfuscating instead of making precise choices, playing 'keep-away' with his characterization. I was also a bit surprised that Perry's character did not use Capote's attraction to him more explicitly for manipulation. It makes him at some times as nuanced and subtle a manipulator as Capote; the duality is warranted, but perhaps Smith should have been cruder and hence more of a messy human being and less of a theme-serving foil.The script is expertly paced, and Dan Futterman shows a great facility for the shape of a scene; all biopics should manage to have a through-line like this one. Hopeful Oscar Nomination. Director Bennett Miller obviously has complete faith in his cast yet does not turn make you feel like the camera is a puppy dog licking them all over the way John Madden does (inexplicably) in 'Proof.' His attention to detail and scope makes this not just a star-vehicle movie like 'Proof' or 'Sylvia,' where complex characters were drafted into vanity projects. Another hopeful Oscar Nomination.What Hoffman makes apparent is that Capote is always the most interesting person in the room. He holds himself above other people, but he probably should. He is able to be manipulative and heartbreakingly honest at the same time and doesn't seem to feel that it takes away from the value of the confidence related that it was done to obtain something. Often, it almost feels like he views these exchanges as barter, and would not feel comfortable if he was simply telling without receiving anything concrete in return. He is condescending and ingenuous at the same time. He attempts to write 'In Cold Blood' in cold blood, with complete objectivity. He ultimately cannot outsmart himself.Philip Seymour Hoffman will be nominated certainly, and may win, and should, at least at this point. We'll see what the rest of the year has to offer. I can't really imagine anyone trumping this performance, but just because he deserves to win doesn't mean he will; remember that the Oscars are a joke and that if he does win it is liable to make his life more, not less, difficult; remember that Samuel Jackson said that he doesn't really want an Oscar because he already has the career he wants and it would just drive his price up; and Hoffman has that theatre to run.",9,1,3,24 October 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Best Film of the Year
","This year, despite a lot of griping, has had some very high highs.  And some very low Pearl Harbors.  Despite all, and several movies that I enjoyed a lot ('Royal Tenenbaums,' 'Gosford Park,' 'Shipping News' is very enjoyable if formulaic [and cowardly when they avoid the part of the book that talks about religion], Michael Winterbottom's 'The Claim' is for consideration this year I think, 'Beautiful Mind' is Ron Howard's best work maybe ever, 'In the Bedroom' with Sissy Spacek just acting the hell out of it), it was clear to me after about 20 minutes, and clearer after three hours, that the best film of the year is 'Fellowship of the Ring.'  I concede that it feels like we're in fast forward quite often but them's the brakes.  The casting is perfect, yes even Liv Tyler, the accents are perfect, even the necessary moments of comic relief by the so-far very marginalized Pippin and Merry are perfectly handled.  The Mountain Troll made Harry's Cave Troll look like Jar Jar Binks (do they really think that looked real?), every exterior topped the ones before, New Zealand was to this film what Tunisia was to Star Wars. The idea of having Christopher Lee as the film's sub-narrator like a dungeons and dragons version of Prospero's Books should get the pic a screenwriting nom and Christopher Lee a Supporting Actor nom, if not the little trophy.  My only real criticism of Elijah Wood is that he has no pores.  Even the negligible beefing up of Arwen was only sensible, and probably something Tolkien would have done himself if his daughter had made her request for a strong female character one book earlier (speaking of which, start buying stock in the actress playing Eowyn.  She's australian I think, I saw her name somewhere, she'll probably be opposite Hugh Jackman in a romantic comedy in no time), and really, in the appendix to the Lord of the Rings, it is what he does: he toughs her up in retrospect.  Bombadil and Goldberry, the Barrow Downs, most of Lothlorien, etc. sad to see you go, and it was annoying that they gave away the Palantir right away.  They pull off the height differences quite well with old fashioned depth of field, and even though it sometimes feels like you're watching someone else play 'Gauntlet,' the fight sequences are visceral and effective.  The score is a bit like Orff fighting Handel to the death at times but when I'm not annoyed by an Enya song something has been packaged right. If New Line gets the guff, they should ditch the three year plan and bring out Two Towers directly opposite 'Spider-Man' which, to be honest, looks like crap (are we supposed to be excited that the spider-man figure looks like it was animated from a crayon box?  same thing as with all the Lucas effects in Star Wars I and the horrendous special edition trilogies.  You know, there's a reason why people used to use puppets: it's because they exist in space). I'm showing my lack of insider savvy there, for all I know New Line paid for some of S-M.  Anyway, as they found out, if they'd opened on as many screens as Harry Porter and the Wizard's Rock they may very well have beaten it, as they well deserved to.  If they don't want to do that I think that reopening it in theatres in the summer will get it another huge run at the box office at least (yes it will be nice on DVD but really if ever there was a film to see again and again in a theatre), maybe format it for IMAX.  Without droning too much more I will say that for me it is Jackson's (and I think that all the credit goes to Jackson, this is his film all the way) seamless integration of effects into the story, of everything into the story, that gives it the drive to keep you watching, but what makes it Best Picture material is the moment where Sam (Sean Astin) very undramatically reflects on how he is about to be further from home than he has ever been before.  Things like that, being able to encapsulate such an emotional kick in one quick moment.  And look for the director himself giving a Hitch-style cameo as a drunken face on the road to the 'Prancing Pony' in Bree.  Fellowship of the Ring, the best picture of the year.  And only now will I admit that I'm going to see 'Ali' tomorrow, and that 'Black Hawk Down' doesn't even show here for two weeks.",10,0,0,3 January 2002
28 Weeks Later," Mayor of Zombiebridge
","First thing that needs saying is that this was much much much better than the average sequel, but no not as good as the original.Do yourself a good turn: go rent 'The Claim' by Michael Winterbottom, based on 'The Mayor of Casterbridge' by Thomas Hardy and you'll see exactly how sly the overall template of this story is.Fresnadillo does not quite equal his fascinating 'Intacto' but his stuff is sure worth watching and will undoubtedly stay that way.Nice to see Stringer Bell and Augustus Hill, Danny Boyle must watch HBO.Okay, the compliments out of the way, there are so many coincidences in this movie and the mechanics so poorly fumbled (not the cinematics, those are uniformly excellent) that it was hard to appreciate the morality play. Is there some sort of zombie telepathic APB? Why would they all know to go to Regent's Park? How could Robert Carlyle follow a speeding Volvo all around London? If the mother is infected and not cleared from quarantine yet would she maybe have 1 guard? Why would they put all of the civilians in an area that isn't actually secure? It's all lazy plot mechanics.Now. I know everyone has fun with the topical story: nuclear family, US army, blah blah blah. Look further into it. If these two stupid kids never left the safe zone the mother never would have been found and the virus would be over. If the good people trying to get a cure for the virus figured out they were allowing the kid to bring the virus to the outside world, the virus would be over. It's almost like the Lars von Trier film 'Epidemic' where a doctor goes around trying to fight a plague that he is carrying around with him unknowingly. A little compassion goes a long way to ending the world. People have been asking on here: would you kill 10 people to save 1000? Well would you kill 10 to save 1? If these people accepted that they should be purged for the safety of humanity, humanity wouldn't die. And the girl (Ms. Poots, teehee) knows her brother has an infection that can cause what she's seen but she doesn't want to admit her worldview is flawed, her selfishness dooms the world.The two kids are completely selfish and stupid, they get person after person killed and don't care a whit, then they get everyone killed and don't care. They are reunited with their father and don't really care (and call him a janitor), they blame him for their mother without knowing one way or another just because they're brats. I guess it's appropriate these are the people that would be the cause of the apocalypse.Now that's over: having Carlyle become a zombie then was really excellent and shocking. Way to go.Problem with this one is that the zombies in Romero still have some kind of inner world beyond zombiehood and these ones don't (and screw you, they're zombies). So you can't really have Muggleston (is that his real name?) grow up to be the Dune Zombie Messiah in 28 months later, they don't really have the potential; but it's still cool that they run.Just like in the Spielberg 'War of the Worlds' it is always interesting to see our view of exactly how quickly everything everywhere could go to hell.",6,0,2,14 May 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Most Overrated Picture of the Year
","Throw a bunch of characters together, each with one characteristic amplified to the point of grotesqueness and you have most of the middling movies from the faux-indieville of the last decade. Distilling them all down into one bewilderingly crowd-pleasing debacle, we have Best Picture nominee 'Little Miss Sunshine.' Never mind that the actual best picture of the year 'Children of Men' was only nominated for one thing, the Oscars are a crock, but let me let some of the air out of your VW bandwagon tires, ye of too much misplaced faith: Paul Dano: Why doesn't Paul Dano talk? Because of Nietzsche. Man, that's hilarious. Wait. Did Nietzsche say anything about not talking that makes this funny? No? Oh, I get it, it's shorthand for pretentious existentialism that the audience can laugh at and feel superior to.Why would someone that reads Nietzsche want to join the US Military? I'm not saying it's impossible, just unlikely, but we at least could have an explanation.How would he never have been tested for color-blindness? Impossible.Steve Carrell: Have you ever noticed that in order to make a general audience understand that someone is smart they always use shorthand? If you're a scientist, you can't just be a great and respected scientist, you have to have won a Nobel. Writers have to have the Pulitzer. And Carrell's character has to be the top Proust scholar in the world. And those repeated gay jokes? Just a way for the writer to try to get away with them. And they weren't funny.They happen to run into the second top Proust scholar in the world at a gas station. Right.Greg Kinnear: They seem to have forgotten to equally distribute the dysfunction. The Kinnear character is the only one that really causes strife in the family. His character is abusive, grating, repetitive, unbelievably and not funny. Most of this isn't Kinnear's fault. But a lot of it is. They would all be happy if they got rid of him at the beginning of the movie.Toni Collette: She is supposed to be the anchor of the family and she does a good job. But she doesn't convey to us why she is married to this guy, and she isn't playing anything most of the time, they forgot to give her a character. Her trait is 'level headed' and that's it.Alan Arkin: I'm not sure why it's funny or endearing that we find out a grandfather has had his granddaughter dancing for him like a stripper for months.Abigail Breslin: How exactly did she win runner-up at the previous competition? I really can only think of two moments in this whole movie where I actually laughed, one was in response to Carrell's droll delivery of one of the many sub-par lines he rose above; the other was when Olive screamed upon finding out she made the competition. And by the way SHE WAS WEARING A FAT SUIT!!!I stress that I did not walk into this film with preconceived notions, except what it says about a film these days when it has been a hit at Sundance. It was simply not fair that a middling, terribly written movie like this cynically manipulating the format of indie-lite was so highly and undeservedly praised.",4,3,7,1 March 2007
Jarhead," Waiting for Saddam
","It's hard to see what all the fuss is about, concerning 'Jarhead.' I have not read the book, but it strikes me as the classic page-to-stage or page-and-screen problem: the real allure of the book is something about the tone, something about the voice, something that might only be approximated by a voice-over. Normally the prospect of tons of people going to see a movie where nothing happens would make me first in line, but this film just isn't about much, and nothing much is revealed other than that Marines are sex-starved, aggressive and bored. The special mark of this movie seems to be: nothing happens. While you will see many scenes of metaphor-challenged commanders orating to shiny (with oil) faced young would-be Audie Murphys, they will only distinguish themselves from the other 8,000 times you have seen this scene because: in that movie it served a purpose. Sure, Roger Deakins kicks ass, now give him something to shoot. I can't really understand how they spent so much time on this film, or so much money, or why Jake Gyllenhaal is getting so much acclaim, he's merely serviceable and not given much to do. Even one of my favorites, Peter Sarsgaard, is getting undeserved praise; his character, obviously underwritten to be seen immediately as a troubled kid with a violent past, instead comes across as the gravedigger from 'Garden State' who got caught raiding the coffins and sent to the military. This makes his eventual fate all the more vague because I had no idea what sequence of events could have caused that to happen to him. This film could have been made with the exact same people in it by Killer Films or some indie outfit and would have greatly benefited by the tarted-up sheen that makes it all too apparent that ain't nothing' going' on and ain't much illumination coming out of that. What did they spend all the money on, anyway? It wasn't on actors, special effects, costumes, locations, maybe just on an overrated director. All three of his films so far have been full of skin-deep metaphor with purported deeper meaning. This one doesn't have the smugness of Kevin Spacey, but it still purports to be some sort of massive statement about the state of the soldier. Perhaps the accumulation of mundane details in the book transcends boring and becomes a statement about man's place in the universe or something, but not in this movie. Just rent Full Metal Jacket again, really. And remember, as one of the posts on this IMDb profile says: 'YOUR ANTI-American IF YOU DON'T SEE IT.' No, seriously, another problem with it is that its attempt to be anti-political just makes it pro-war. Sorry, but not to be explicitly against a war you are participating in (as Pat Tillman was recently revealed to be, incidentally) is to tacitly endorse it. Of course there isn't free-speech in the military, but then why is the person told to shut up against the war instead of for it? Telling that person that politics don't matter because they're there isn't like making a statement about reality and a present situation; it is a statement like telling people today that more lives should be wasted in Iraq to justify the other wasted lives and not insult their memory already, and as there are people shouting that the film was made by 'liberals' and a director from the UK who hasn't served, let me say as an ACLU member that it is the sort of left-wing propaganda I could do without. It's about as left-wing as Joe Lieberman. The only real good I can see coming out of this film is that hopefully some of the military wives and girlfriends will think twice before two-timing their men overseas.",5,0,2,14 November 2005
Shrek the Third," It's official: Mike Myers isn't funny.
","The difference between the pretend laughter we dredge up at our corny uncle's bad jokes and the forced laughter of several thousand CGI characters is that our uncle isn't being paid millions of dollars to not be funny. 'Do they come in women's sizes?' Does that qualify as a joke that wouldn't be heard in dinner theatre? The songs they use in this one don't even make any sense: 'Live and Let Die' at a funeral? It's a James Bond song that Guns 'n Roses covered, it isn't a freaking funeral dirge, to me it's more about maybe an idealistic character who, when presumed to be soft, kicks your @$$. Not for a tearjerking funeral. And, yeah, what is with the extra 'in' anyway? They could just stretch out 'World' and make it 'world which we live in.' Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy have some funny moments, and there are a few good sight gags, but it's sunk from the lack of a charismatic lead. Myers is on such auto-pilot that you can hear him cracking himself up at times, not realizing that he isn't being funny. The problem maybe stems from something he said while he was on that 'Inside the Actor's Studio' lovefest: he doesn't think there's a difference between a fart joke and sophisticated humour (and justifies it by saying that Shakespeare did both). Well, Mike, they aren't the same. They can both have their place in the same work and one can bring relief from another, but that's no reason to just settle for the fart joke because it's easier, you're lazy, and they're the same thing, they're not. I think that Myers lost all his talent between Austin Powers 2 and 3, there was still some there in 2 but by the time he threw a 3 minute Pepsi commercial into the 3rd one it was all gone. Then when everyone saw him with Kanye West and then heard he's going to play Keith Moon (who died at 32 and Myers is now 44) we all had to remind ourselves he ever had any talent at all. Well this isn't going to contravene that impression.Anyway, the movie is a hunk 'o junk because of the lack of effort put into it. Myers should stop doing 'movies' and go into commercials full time. He turned a character that was likable for being genuinely unlikeable and edgy and turned it into an inoffensive, unfunny shiller of happy meals. Otherwise known as a Canadian.",4,4,6,27 May 2007
Children of Men," Best Film of 2007
","It's easy to come up with a snappy snarky review of a bad movie (Babel) or even a good but flawed movie (too many to mention), but it is hard to entertainingly praise a movie so I won't really try. This is the best film of 2007 (that I saw, anyway...let's restrict it to 'Best in contention for Oscar'). All the elements aligned, perfect casting both of stars and unknowns (what a surprise, Julianne Moore has a dead child again!) especially Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Caine, Peter Mullan and Claire Hope-Ashitey, unbelievable cinematography (I was fooled into thinking it was one take), a lead performance that is a mammoth of slowly skinned disaffectedness by Clive Owen, a cracking script that balances visuals and terse effective dialogue, moments that are frankly terrifying (the attack on the car, the hood pulled over the face), and the courage to leave the ending hopeful without saving the main character.Only qualm: You should have saved the main character. There was really no reason for the story to demand that he sacrifice himself, having him die and not even see that the boat came didn't really say anything, let the dude live.A great film by an imaginative, intelligent, deferential, groundbreaking director who should stop being friends with that jackass Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Keep 'em coming.",10,2,5,1 March 2007
Grindhouse," Murder Porn.
","I was surprised that, of the two, Rodriguez's was more entertaining. Tarantino seems so in love with his unimpressive dialogue (especially an interminable exchange about 'Ship's Captain') that he forgot to make a movie. Somehow the main players, Rose McGowan, Rosario Dawson, Kurt Russell, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, etc., came off pretty well anyway, and some of the supporting players, esp. Jeff Fahey and Josh Brolin, came off better than well. But even Rodriguez's entry was pretty terrible and curiously uninvolving. My main problem with the whole thing was the trailer for 'Thanksgiving.' There is no way something that sexually violent would have played in a trailer, and it probably never would have been allowed to be seen. I've seen some pretty messed up stuff, but the knife through the trampoline and the last shot of the cooked woman with a baster were pretty close to evil, and I am not a religious person. I really think these murder pornography images are only half a reflection of the world under W. The other half is people that think showing someone being murdered for half an hour is artistic freedom. Eli Roth is at the top of this list, his movies are crappy and they're successful because of the murder porn. I just hope these filmmakers contract some sort of social responsibility virus soon and stop lovingly photographing severed legs flopping onto the pavement, or creating characters and getting us to care about them and then peeling their heads off (both from 'Death Proof'). Is this the Tarantino that satirized Oliver Stone with 'Coming Home in a Body Bag'?And if Tarantino is such a feminist hero, why did the girls leave their cheerleader-dressed friend to be assaulted by Tom Joad? What, at the start of the movie they're callous but killing Kurt Russell makes them grow as people, is that the arc?Nothing more really needs to be said, they set out to make bad movies and Tarantino won; they just didn't make them enjoyable. The worst thing is that all of these reviewers piled on to spray deodorizer on this crappy movie and now they're baffled that it didn't do better. It didn't do better because it was bad, people were right to see 'Blades of Glory' instead. Tarantino will bounce back; the emperor is wearing clothes, he just made a terrible movie.",3,19,40,9 April 2007
Mystic River," Return of the Airport Paperback
","***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Yet again, Clint Eastwood gets away with what a first-timer would be crucified for. This is not a good movie. This is not a well-made movie. This is not a deeply felt psychological thriller with resonance for all of us. This is a failed attempt by an airport paperback writer to be something bigger and better. And it is a failed attempt by a once brilliant director to regain his former glory. The emperor is naked and if this film takes a single award away from another one that deserves it, it will be a real crime.Oh, no! Is there a **SPOILER** coming up? Let me break down to you why the film falls apart. The ending. There are several viable endings this film could have had, ones that at least would have ended such underwhelming proceedings on a solid note. Instead they chose none of these endings. Okay, so Penn sold out the 'mute' kid's old man. So the kid killed Penn's daughter for revenge, right? No. Okay, so he and his suddenly psychotic little friend killed her out of the 'mute' kid's jealousy, and fear of losing his brother, right? No. The 'Mute' kid (who, thank heavens, was at least less annoying than he was in the execrable 'Unbreakable') didn't even know about Penn selling out the father, neither did the one that wanted to marry Penn's daughter, total red herring. And they didn't plan it, they happened to lie down in the middle of the street and she happened to be coming by right then. Then they accidentally shot her. Then the killing was the 'Suddenly Psycho' other friend's fault, as he attacks the kid that wanted to marry her. Then we're told that they just killed her to cover up their mistake, and THEN we're told she was beaten because the 'mute' kid happened to have a hockey stick so he beat her with it. Presumably to keep time, I suppose. And the 'mute' kid isn't mute, so says his brother, but we get absolutely no evidence of this.Let's keep going, with Marcia Gay Harden. She has been exceptional in a number of great movies, so I don't feel bad being a bit harsh here. What was she thinking? What was Brian Helgeland (whose 'Blood Work' and previous Eastwood scripts were on par with his own script for 'The Sin Eater' or 'The Order' which made 'Gigli' look coherent) thinking, or Lehane? She comes out doing every tell in the book, every indicator that no actor is supposed to even try to get away with, shouts 'My husband didn't kill anyone!' or something and then when Bacon (who rocked, by the way) says 'What?' she says 'Oh, nothing, nothing, I didn't say anything!' as if it wasn't plainly audible and then run away in diagonal patterns looking back over her shoulder and hyperventilating for 2 blocks while Bacon stands there watching her. Then in the last scene after Laura Linney has to do her Lady MacB turn Gay Harden is doing the same thing following her son, I expected to hear 'Pagliacci' on the soundtrack at that point and a slo-mo it was getting so lame.How about Tim Robbins' character? He'd rather be thought a murderer of his friend's daughter than of some anonymous perv? His wife obviously suspects him and he never just tells her what's going on? She tells Penn instead of Bacon? Fishburne is totally wasted, and though Penn is being lauded everywhere it is really an external performance. Just like the author seems not to have any idea what any of these situations actually feel like, just what they look like, he doesn't take you with him where his character is going. It is ridiculous that he is being honored for this film instead of the far superior '21 Grams' in which he is still pretty inaccessible and/or not really that deeply layered.Bacon is the only real revelation here. He at least deserves some kind of nomination and he's not going to get it.Here is the real tragedy of this one. The film has technical mistakes of the kind not found in the first year of film school. 1) a boom mic dips into the shot on a Boston street and 2) during a long dolly shot in a cemetery the front row of headstones is highly reflective and you can see the entire dolly with cameraman sitting on it. 3) how about the kids at the beginning? They flip-flop the color of their hair and name the one that looks like Sean Penn 'Sean'! Oh, and how did killing the wrong guy that had nothing to do with anything make Penn's character the king of the neighborhood? There is too much more to cover in less than a whole book.Stop pretending this is a good movie and pay attention to the ones that deserve it.This comment was deleted off the site before because somebody complained because they did not agree with it. I have reposted it without changing anything because that is a pretty cowardly thing to do. If you don't like unrelentingly negative criticism, fall in love with a filmmaker that has retained some talent; I hear Terry Gilliam's new film might actually get a theatrical release. If you don't agree with it then try to refute it. And if you don't like it, lump it.",3,5,9,3 August 2006
War of the Worlds," War of a Very Small World
","'It all happened without me. Absent always.' These Beckettian sentiments apply to the POV of Spielberg's underachieving 'War of the Worlds' remake. It feels like we are watching a subplot cut from the actual movie. If Mel Gibson was the star, you can be sure that the son's character would be vaporized, leaving Mel with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch to exact bloody vengeance upon the extraterrestrial interlopers. In this one we simply watch the son act petulant over and over, Dakota Fanning scream over and over and over and over, and Tom Cruise's eyes tear up with emotion he lacks the means to convey, a nifty trick to get around the fact that he can't really act.***Spoilers Ahoy!*** So Tom Cruise is forced to kill Tim Robbins because he won't shut up. So some feel that way about Robbin's politics (as we are reminded by every moron in the world bootstrapped onto Chris Rock's Oscar night barbs), but for the sake of humanity whatever happened to rope, a chair, and a gag? The screenwriters seem eager to cash out their moments before they have accrued sufficient returns, or interest. A credit for story on the clunker 'Chain Reaction' should send up flags. He also (Josh Friedman) has a script consultation credit for 'Hitchhiker's'is he responsible for the awfully handled love story in that one? 'Sahara' too. This guy has a hell of a track record. It looks like David Koepp's contribution was to take things out so there is almost no dialogue. The extermination scenes are surprisingly disturbing and vile, and presented with no editorializing. Instead of feeling mature, this instead feels like their full impact was not comprehended and they picked most of the images because they looked cool, you drink that human blood, martian! Several fine actors are featured for mere moments: Danny Hoch or someone that looks a lot like him (he isn't listed in the cast) as a cop, Daniel Franzese is in it for a minute, Rick Gonzales from 'The Rookie' doesn't even get a name, Mariann Mayberry from Steppenwolf I didn't even recognize on screen, but she's credited. Morgan Freeman is becoming the James Earl Jones of narration.The leads do not fare so well. Robbie looks like Jason Mraz and does not much with not much, the scene where he runs off into the fray is pitifully anticlimactic; I can't but think someone must have been embarrassed on the day they shot that ('is this actually going in the movie?'). Dakota Fanning enlarges upon her screen library of neuroses: here she is a claustrophobic with back problems that screams uncontrollably, she's like a cute little blond old Jewish man, Woody Allen is on line 2. Cruise is Cruise, when isn't he? Maybe he looks a little nuts at times, buthe is a little nuts, maybe more than a little. Tim Robbins part is a plot device and not a human being. Miranda Otto looks like a slightly animated cloven pine. Her beau Tim (david alan basche) is embalmed.Everything from the most gruesome to the most inconsequential is observed with the same strange detachment and lack of affect, translating into lack of effect. This movie just feels really inconsequential. The ending is so peremptory and ridiculous: in this day and age it seems hard to buy that they buried the ships there but never thought about bacteria. Maybe back when the book was written and antiseptic was still as novel as the iPod is today. Maybe there is still a good movie to be made from this material, but this sure as heck ain't it.At least it avoided the baseball bat scene from 'Signs.'",4,2,2,9 July 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Absurd.
","Forest Whitaker's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck. 'Historical fiction' does not justify changing history. The absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by James McAvoy. To create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable, regrettable that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to, but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role. Making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible, lazy and stupid. Not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal, and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with Leonardo DiCaprio as a heroic Enron whistleblower who NEVER EXISTED. The logic of the world does not apply in this film where some Scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator. It doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy. For that matter EVERYBODY is lined up to sleep with this scrawny, irresponsible, arrogant white boy, he even has Gillian Anderson licking her comely chops.Let me declare, I do not like James McAvoy. I'm not sure what it is about him, but I thought his Mr. Tumnus in Narnia was creepy and pervy. I think that Kerry Washington would never look twice at him so I can't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like Amin would risk and lose her life for him. I don't believe him as a Doctor, and I just don't see the appeal. His character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense, and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just...there's that word again...absurd. Think about it, you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy.Gillian Anderson looks incredible and sounds more British than most Brits. Whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance, and highlighted, with his incomprehensible pre-Oscar speeches, just how much he was acting. It's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist.",4,36,55,1 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Failed I have. Move to Canada I must.
","Despite almost 30 years of warm up, Lucas still didn't come up with a  strong enough character motivation to explain Anakin becoming Darth  Vader.  Now when I watch the original do I have to imagine a sniveling, pouty  little punk in the suit? Lucas gave James Earl Jones some of his  trademark magic dialogue for his return: 'Nooooooo!'. Thanks, George.  I love how they have C3PO's memory wiped at the end, as if that closes  the plot hole. R2 would have been able to remind him. They should have  mentioned disabling R2's ability to fly and somersault out of planes  too.  Yes, this is the best of the new 3. It couldn't be worse than the  first, which only avoids the title of 'Worst Film of All Time' because  it wasn't shot on film.  The political parallels are the best thing the film has going for it.  However, I would like to remind everyone that 'If you're not with me  you're my enemy,' has been said for a MILLION years! If you want a real  laugh try attributing anything to W and convincing them it is a quote  he came up with other than his malapropisms.  The flipping Yoda is stupid. I know some geek somewhere thought it  would be really coolbut it isn't.  Ian McDiarmid gives a pretty good performance, but the silly faces he  makes while shocking people remind one why he is otherwise noticeably  absent from the annals of film history.  Keisha Castle-Hughes with the tiny part is pretty funny. The best  actress nominee walking behind the casket of the best supporting  actress nominee.  Ummmwhy did Padme die? She was 'giving up'? When she had two new kids  to look out for? Maybe if they had her give birth, have the kids hide,  go to try to win Anakin back and he kills her the movie might have  actually worked.  Sorry, Fanboys, I know you are all ready to dive back into the pool,  but this was still stale, unengaging and trite. I wish Lucas had never  made these three. There isn't a single moment in the entire new trilogy  that conveys the thrills of the trash compactor scene in the first  trilogy, or the fight on Hoth orwell, anything, even anything from  THX-1138. It's junk. If you'd held out after Episode 1 and demanded  better you might have got better, maybe he would have given up  directing like he did after Episode 4, but you didn't and they're crap.  If this is your idea of good then you deserve Jar Jar and what the  movie studios give you.  Sorry if this isn't a funny arch review but I found how terrible these  movies are, along with Lucas's systematic violation of our memories  with the pathetic changes he made to the original to be seriously  depressing. The man has no judgment. Why would Anakin at the end of  'Jedi' reappear as Haydn Christensen? He would appear as the redeemed  old shell he was when he died, like he did originally. Any fool could  see that except the fool with the control. Lucas makes studio control  look good.  A friend said this and I agree: what do I feel about this film? Relief  that it is all over.",3,266,462,20 May 2005
