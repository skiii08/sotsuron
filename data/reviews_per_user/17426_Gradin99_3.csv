Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best action adventure film in history! :)
","What can I say, my summary says it all!  It's great.  It has everything you would want in a film.  Action.  Adventure.  Romance.  Comedy.  My third favorite film of all time !  Steven Spielberg's best film equal to Schindler's List.  List is better, yet my personal favorite is Raiders!",10,0,0,21 November 1999
Singin' in the Rain," The Best Musical of All Time :) ~!
","Wow.  I recently saw this film for the first time and adored it!  It is second of all time on my list.  It has everything you would want in a film. Comedy (lots).  Romance.  Drama.  Great Songs.  Highly recommended.  It has great writing, the acting is excellent and its just entertaining.!  A pinnacle in Hollywood movie making.",10,4,8,21 November 1999
The Green Mile," Way too Long for such a simple plot!
","The movie's acting was great, yet the film unfolded very very slow to such a simple script.  Not was I was expecting.  The Shawshank Redemption has more plot development than The Green Mile.  Surely an OVERRATED film! My grade~( B )",1,7,31,15 January 2000
