The Blair Witch Project," Highly overrated film.
","I went to the U.S. (i live close to the border) just to see the movie. I wanted to know what all this 'Blair Witch project' hype was all about. Well, all i can say is that i felt a little disappointed. It's one of those 'totally cool, gotta see it' movies, then in the end, if you say what you really felt about the movie, you're risking on everyone telling you that youre a jerk for not liking it. First, those dizzing camera takes, then the feeling of thinking 'when is this movie REALLY going to start' then the 'gee, did i miss something?' end. it was a good movie, but really not that good.",Null,0,0,22 August 1999
