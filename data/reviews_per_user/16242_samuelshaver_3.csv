The Incredible Hulk," More or less, Bland
","It's not to often that I give a movie 5 out of 10 stars but this movie is unique in its own un-unique way. Yeah, I just said that. The reason why I say that this movie is bland but unique is because its good and bad add up to take it right to the level of mediocrity. When I saw the movie, 'Iron Man', I was amazed by how it truly was a unique and un-average superhero pop corn flick, and seeing how the back of its DVD Box spoke of how it was as exhilarating as Iron Man I decided to give it a try. The Film opens up in Rocinha while Edward Norton is searching for a cure for his strange (green) trouble. By this point in the film it does seem to have some promise, yet by The Battle at The Culver University Campus that hope of uniqueness begins to fade away. Also, I'd like to take a section of this review to a bothering problem of the film and that is Mr. Blue, aka The Professor. This character is acting as a jumpy old professor but is dressed in a T-Shirt and Jeans, and played by a man in his late Twenties or early Thirties. Therefore, this character is torn apart between to characteristics. (Spoilers included in Next Paragraph)Now this movie would have been possibly, and slightly above mediocrity if it wasn't for a disgraceful ending. Now, this ending consists of Robert Downey Jr. as his character in Iron Man speaking of a 'Team'. This ending feels like by the current point of disappointment, they plainly gave up on the fact that the movie as an original might stand up as an original and instead changed the movie to just an unreasonably long trailer for Marvels, 'Avengers'.This movie does not stand up on its own as an original and will surely not be remembered but instead be replaced by yet another, hopefully more memorable Hulk popcorn flick.",5,0,3,25 December 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," One out of six ain't bad.
","Now let's get one thing strait. I love the Harry Potter series. The movies and the novels. Love 'em. Now, the the first movie's great, and so is the second, third, fifth, and sixth are as well. But my job tonight is to review the missing piece of the puzzle. 'Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire.' Now if you haven't been hidden in a trunk for 3 years, you would know that there's been a bit of a teenage phenomenon with a certain vampire series, Twilight, starring a certain handsome vampire that girls seem to be nuts about. This vampire as been named Robert Pattinson and seemed to have landed a substantial acting career out of the woods. I, for one, am not a huge fan of this series. So, let me fill you in on a little secret about, 'Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire', It IS Twilight. Twenty minutes into the movie I had this claim, and then all of a sudden, who appears on camera that Hollywood's favorite vampire.Also this movie confuses becoming more mature, with losing creativity. Now, I haven't read the novel yet, but this movie is about as predictable as the come. Someone's name will be picked from The Goblet of Fire! I wonder who? The suspense is all to much! So, in a nutshell, it was pretty bad. Yet, I haven't read the book, so why should I be complaining when I could be frolicking in the fields or, jogging, or taking pictures of various oak leaves! You know, I think I will. So long, and off to the fields with me!",3,0,0,25 September 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Mediocre.
","The first time I saw this film I loved it. Later I started to watch some new episodes of The Simpsons and laughed continuously. Later I went to the Theater to see this movie again, and I then realized that while It contains the occasional laugh, the movie is bland. This movie starts off with a bang when The Simpsons family goes to see The Itchy and Scratchy Movie. The movie slowly goes downhill from that, and the ending is very weak. While the movie isn't bad its not very good either. After I had watched several episodes of The Simpsons I felt a bit ripped off of my money. As Homer says,' Why are we paying to see something we could see for free on T.V?'. I couldn't agree more.",5,2,5,20 December 2007
