Iron Man 3," What did happen to (SIR) Ben Kingsley?
","Spoiler review using the top crap in topics:1 - CSI Tony Stark; 2 - Kid Sidekick (and everything related to this...); 3 - Tony buys a shitload of items at a store... With what money (he was still considered dead, so, would he use a credit card to pinpoint his position or did he have all that cash)? 4 - Mandarin M Night Shaymalan plot twist; 5 - Ben Kingsley being poorly used ; 6 - Tony Stark man of mystery (yeah, the suit is not working and he is presumed death, so why not just go rampaging through the mansion of a house full of armed people - without any military training or weapon usage notion...? Especially when he could easily called a) SHIELD, b) HIS BEST FRIEND - War Machine/Iron Patriot, c) Jarvis FOR ANOTHER GODAMN SUIT - that's in the damn end); 7 - There's more scenes of Tony Stark using actual weapons (mostly revolvers) than the Iron Man suit; 8 - The evil plan was yet again a piece of crap of an evil plan (if we can consider it to make any sense... Why strike at Stark when they needed him to repair the Extremis? Why the villain has no contigency plan for the case of ANY of his plans failing - and they fail the entire movie); 9 - Stark READS A FULL REPORT WHILE DRIVING!!! 10 - Patty the daytime hooker has a more detailed report than the military - yeah, because that didn't fit the pattern, right... (Rhodes declares to Tony they have no clue of what is going on, while the mother of a presumed bomber has a full report with detailed info?) 11 - EXTREMIS MAKES NO SENSE (It regenerates people's injuries... So how is it possible for Iron Man and his amazing friends to kill so many of them at the end scene)? 12 - Destroying every suit for... fireworks? 13 - Why exactly is the movie set on Christmas time again? 14 - If it IS so easy to remove the shrapnels around his heart, wouldn't one, I don't know ACTUAL DOCTOR have said it to Tony? 15 - Too many comedy... Too many jokes... Too few Iron Man...Plus sides? Great actors giving their best for a crap script that makes no sense, or serves any purpose.A bad movie, and I'm a guy that liked Iron Man 2.",4,30,61,27 April 2013
