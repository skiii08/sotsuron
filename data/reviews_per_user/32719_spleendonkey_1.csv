Mission: Impossible III," Rubbish
","This film was terrible. So bland and unimaginative, it was filmed like a TV episode with an over abundance of close ups and was so tacky and clich√©d. I can't believe that after the first film, which is very good, the series has descended into this so quickly. The acting and script were sub par at best as well.What baffles me further is the high rating for this one. I mean honestly, it was sub par Hollywood drivel, there are far better films out there, doing the same thing only better.Is it me or does JJ Abrams come across to anyone else as a massively sub par Joss Wheedon? Please give this a miss people.",2,3,15,10 May 2006
