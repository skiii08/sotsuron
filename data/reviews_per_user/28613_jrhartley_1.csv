Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I think I laughed twice, so one vote for each giggle
","Honestly, this was really a painful watch. There's nothing clever about the humour in this, it basically works along the lines or humiliating Americans for having some very bigoted opinions and being out of touch with the modern world (or just stupid) - which is a theme that's been around in Europe amongst comedians for a good 20 years+ now. so if you're European and you watch any comedy at all, you're unlikely to see much in this film that hasn't already been done to death on TV or on the stand-up circuit. a lot of the humour is very forced - one of the times i laughed was when the guy fell off his horse at the rodeo - so something completely by chance, outside of the film-maker's control. i expect a lot of Americans think they are being right-on by liking this film and laughing at themselves, but i think its important not just to like something because it mocks you, there needs to be some quality behind the humour, and there just isn't here. save your 80-odd minutes, i'm sure there's some paint drying somewhere which needs watching.",2,4,8,28 November 2006
