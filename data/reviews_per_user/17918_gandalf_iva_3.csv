Black Swan," Portman might be an incredible talent but there's only so much she can do with bullet ridden story
","Today I had an opportunity to screen one of the anticipated movies of 2010, Black Swan. Like the character in the movie suggest- ballet is not for everyone, and as it turns out, not for me. While I enjoyed the complex portrayal of Nina Sayers (N.Portman), I was somewhat underwhelmed with the remaining aspects of the movie. Wizard who is responsible for bringing us the ultimate drug addiction tale 'Requiem for a dream', Darren Arnofsky, significantly underachieved and got swallowed up by the worst kind of a monster- mediocrity. While Portman dances skillfully amidst issues such as being over-controlled, inhibited and somewhat destructive the rest of characters don't really bring anything to the table. Mila Kunis who portrays the role of the uninhibited effortless seductress, the Black Swan, fell short and while she was believable the character was noticeably underdeveloped. However flawed the story might be, it's worth watching, so see it if you have the opportunity",8,1,6,20 December 2010
Closer," Brillint unveiling of sex,love
","Let me start off with saying that casting is brilliant. We have best men Clive Owen and Jude Law and the best ladies Roberts and Portman.The story of two pairings, 2 men, a woman and a girl. The movie is a series of events in life of fallen writer Dan. The movie is accurate about love, about sex. This movie isn't hard to watch and it definitely breaks illusions in our eyes. Makes us see how people work, what kinds of love exist. The movie is a brilliant achievement, only improved with great performers. This movie rocked my world and It's one of those movies I could watch over and over. However, I would not recommend this movie if you're looking for fun or are particularly happy person euphoric about life.",10,0,1,12 October 2006
The Illusionist," Truly magnificent movie
","My eye was drawn to this movie because it stars Ed Norton(who made his name in cult movie Fightclub) and Jessica Biel. This movie is set in Vienna. It follows life of a brilliant man Eisenheim through eyes of local chief inspector. Norton portraits Eisenheim very beliavble and introduces us in the world of Austrian prince, dutchess and the magician.The script is one of a kind, it truly moves us and creates illusions within us. It touched me, made me cry and laugh at the same time.I strongly recommend watching this movie weather you believe in magic or not, this is a movie about a man who broke out of his world and amazed and deceived (in a good way) everyone.",10,1,2,5 October 2006
