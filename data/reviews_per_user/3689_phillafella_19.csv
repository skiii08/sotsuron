Saturday Night Fever," Travolta Lights Up the Screen.
","The intelligence of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER is probably due to John Travolta's hunk appeal and wild strut.  It's amazing that Travolta can go from the rowdy but clean-cut Vinnie Barbarino to the foul-mouthed disco king Tony Manero and still be successful.  The music really defines the era of disco and makes the film a big hit that is still popular even if disco is dead and gone.  The street language is acceptable, but it also prevents the movie from being perfect.  Altogether, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER is a very watchable movie highlighted by Travolta's dance solo.  Very impressive.4 out of 5",8,0,1,17 May 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Something Very Special About This Film.
","RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is a true masterpiece of a movie.  It was unlike any other movie in the 80's.  Harrison Ford stars as the unforgettable Indiana Jones, who takes on snakes and Nazis to retrieve the powerful Ark of the Covenant.  Karen Allen is a brilliant love interest.  The opening sequence is classic and the visuals are some of the most explosive I have ever seen. The fine collaboration of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg is pure magic. Perfect entertainment.5 out of 5",10,0,1,19 June 2003
Se7en," Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and the Seven Deadly Sins.
","What a gem of a movie this is?  SE7EN is one of the most intense thrillers ever made.  Morgan Freeman stars as a retiring detective who teams up with his soon-to-be replacement (Brad Pitt) to track down a serial killer who is committing murders according to the seven deadly sins.  With a teriffic cast, a well-written script and lots of substance, SE7EN works in very many ways and never misses.5 out of 5",10,0,0,22 June 2003
Wayne's World," The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen...NOT!!
","WAYNE'S WORLD is actually one of the best SNL-inspired comedies ever made. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are way cool as Wayne and Garth.  It's just shameful that the movie contains mostly wasted music...HYUH, RIGHT, if monkeys fly out of my butt.  I think it the music here is excellent.  Tia Carerre is hot as Wayne's love interest, and Rob Lowe does a fine job as the con artist who buys Wayne and Garth's show.  Believe me, it's worthy.4 out of 5",7,27,36,12 April 2003
Fight Club," Entertaining, But Nothing Special.
","FIGHT CLUB stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton as two men who form an underground club where people fight, and the hype catches on with people around the country.  This is an entertaining movie with good leads and acceptable fight scenes, but it's barely passable at best.  The plot is unbelievably dumb, there are a few plot holes and the story fails to make sense at some points.  Pitt and Norton carry the film, but the other characters are one-dimensional and have little or no interest.  The movie is well worth a watch, but it's still a disappointment.2 out of 5",5,4,11,27 May 2003
Rocky V," Disappointing Finale to a Triumphant Saga.
","In this final chapter of the ROCKY series, the Italian Stallion, now broke and brain damaged from his last fight, faces a promoter who wants him to do another bout, an amateur boxer whom he agrees to train, and his own son who starts to feel neglected.  This time around, even Stallone gives a weak performance, and Tommy Morrison fails to make an impression as Rocky's Robot Tommy Gunn.  Sly's real-life son Sage, who plays Rocky Jr,, and Burgess Meredith's brief appearance as Mickey are the only characters with any interest.  The bottom spot of the movie is the climaxing streetfight, which barely makes the film worth a watch.2 out of 5",3,3,8,27 May 2003
Stripes," A Fine Tribute to the Laziest Army Recruits.
","STRIPES is a very funny movie that stars Bill Murray as a fired cab driver who decides to join the Army, taking along his best friend in the process. This may as well be Murray's funniest comedy as a leading man, as well as the most hilarious Army comedy.  Harold Ramis, who directed Murray in CADDYSHACK, makes an excellent co-star as Murray's best friend, and John Candy makes a brilliant appearance as the overweight recruit who has joined `just to lose weight.'  I especially enjoyed the strip club and graduation sequences.  A reunion for Murray and director Ivan Reitman, who teamed for MEATBALLS, a much weaker movie.  Here, Murray proves that he can be entertaining and funny at the same time.4 out of 5",7,1,2,24 April 2003
Rocky II," Great Sequel.
","ROCKY II continues the saga of club fighter Rocky Balboa.  In this interesting sequel, heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), destined to take Rocky down by knockout, tempts the underdog for a rematch.  The actors turn in fine performances and the story is satisfactory.  However, this time around, the training sequences are a little bit déjà vu, and the climaxing match between Rocky and Apollo is not as amusing.  Has its share of fun, though, and still packs a punch.4 out of 5",7,0,0,27 May 2003
Forrest Gump," Magical in Every Aspect.
",FORREST GUMP is among the greatest movies of all time.  It's a kind of movie that grows on you and never wants to let go.  Tom Hanks is at his best playing a Southern boy whose life is affected by many various moments of U.S. history.  Robin Wright provides a cute love interest in a movie that never gets tedious or boring.  FORREST GUMP definitely stands the test of time and is still enjoyable to watch to this day.  A cinematic masterpiece.5 out of 5,10,0,4,13 June 2003
Armageddon," Definitely the Wrong Stuff.
","I remember looking at APOLLO 13 and seeing how great it was, and now we have ARMAGEDDON, which is actually a ho-hum End-Of-The-World picture about a group of drillers who go into outer space to destroy a huge asteroid the size of Texas before it hits Earth, ending all life as we know it.  The movie has a much weaker story than APOLLO 13, and the special effects are some of the cheeziest I've seen in recent years.  If you like outer space movies, I recommend APOLLO 13.  If you like special effects-filled doomsday movies, the one for you is INDEPENDENCE DAY.  ARMAGEDDON is not much of a thrill ride of a movie that is only saved by Aerosmith's hit ballad.2 out of 5",4,0,2,11 April 2003
Rocky IV," Entertaining Entry in a Saga That's Slowly Showing Its Age.
","In this third sequel to the smash hit ROCKY, the world is introduced to a Russian boxer named Drago, who can cause severe damage with a single punch. Drago demonstrates his strength by killing Apollo Creed in the ring, then the Italian Stallion challenges the Russian boxer himself, risking his own life.  The saga gets weaker with every entry, and this entry loses its edge by the end, but the performances from Stallone, Dolph Lundgren (as Drago) and Brigitte Nielsen (as Drago's wife) make the movie well worth watching.3 out of 5",5,1,2,27 May 2003
Independence Day," The Special Effects Save the Day.
","Aliens attack the Earth and it's up to a band of survivors to save the world.  Considering sub-par performances and an empty plot, INDEPENDENCE DAY is fun to watch for one thing...the special effects.  Otherwise, this film would have been a lot worse.  One other positive thing is that it made plenty of money at the box office, so it goes to show that a movie can make hundreds of millions of dollars and not have much to show for it, but this film is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys watching stuff get blowed up.3 out of 5",6,0,1,12 July 2003
1941," Nothing Spectacular About This Epic Turkey.
","I can't imagine how anyone, even Steven Spielberg, can make a movie like this and call it `Spectacular.'  1941, a so-called comedy that depicts events in California after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, is not even close to passable and is one of the worst movies ever.  The hilarity isn't there, the performances are all lame and the special effects are as dumb as ever.  Even the JAWS parody at the beginning is turkey material.  This is Spielberg's absolute lowpoint, a big budget bomb that fails so miserably that it makes the awful film EARTHQUAKE look like a masterpiece.  A real fiasco.0 out of 5",1,11,22,27 May 2003
Rocky," A Knockout!
","ROCKY tells the story of club boxer Rocky Balboa, who gets his shot at fame and the championship title thanks to the current heavyweight champ. Sylvester Stallone is surprisingly awesome in his first lead role and it is definitely Stallone at his best.  The other characters are interesting as well, including Talia Shire as Rocky's girlfriend Adrian, Carl Weathers as the undefeated champ Apollo Creed and Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer Mickey.  The training sequence and the climaxing match are also great moments.  Brilliant entertainment.5 out of 5",9,0,0,27 May 2003
Rocky III," Well, You Can't Win 'Em All.
","In ROCKY III, the Italian Stallion loses the championship title to the ruthless Clubber Lang, Mickey dies and Apollo tries to get the former champ back on his feet for a rematch against the new champ.  Stallone is good here, the training sequences steal the show (as always), and Mr. T's role as Clubber is not bad, but the story becomes predictable by halfway.  As usual, sequels aren't as good as the original, but this one has its moments and is still very much a winner.3 out of 5",6,0,1,27 May 2003
Jaws," Spielberg's First Big Hit.
","After the unexpected failure of THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS, which has now become a cult classic, Steven Spielberg got his big break when he directed JAWS, the story of a killer shark that terrorizes a beach resort.  Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are the three men who set out to destroy the shark.  Brilliant performances from the three leads and intense horror are the highlights of this film.  The cinematograpy and the effects are well done too.  Classic.5 out of 5",9,0,1,26 June 2003
The Waterboy," All Dried Up.
","Adam Sandler works as a water boy for a college football team with a huge slump.  One day, fed up with getting teased by the football players, he finally snaps, and coach Winkler puts him on the team.  Another weak vehicle for Sandler, who provides a character that's just as witless and 1-D as his other roles, and his Porky Pig accent is terrible.  The other actors provide some relief, but this film is still very much a loser.1 out of 5",3,2,3,27 July 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Could Be the Most Important Film of the Decade.
","I have nothing but praise for THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  It is touching, high-spirited and full of motivation.  Tim Robbins plays a banker who is wrongly convicted of the murders of his wife and her lover.  He is sentenced to life in prison and eventually befriends another lifer (played by Morgan Freeman in a powerful role) who has just been denied parole.  It may sound like a simple story, but Frank Darabont's direction, along with endearing performances and a cheerful climax, makes the film so energetic and magical. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a breath-taking masterpiece.5 out of 5",10,0,1,14 December 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A Triumph Over 'Temple of Doom.'
","In this third and, so far, last of the INDIANA JONES series, the famous archaeologist (Harrison Ford) teams with his father (Sean Connery) to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do.  This entry will never top the original, but it is more fun than TEMPLE OF DOOM, and proves that the legendary hero is in true form.  Connery is in top form as Indy's father, one of his best roles.  In the end, LAST CRUSADE is a great cinematic achievement.4 out of 5",8,1,1,19 June 2003
