The Blair Witch Project," This film made me think twice about camping in the woods.
","This film was excellent. The story could not have been executed any better. Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Michael Williams gave unbelievably realistic performances. This movie should be reviewed by film students in order to see how to make the audience's hearts pound, jaws drop, and palms sweat. The final 5 minutes are some of the greatest moments in film history. This film made me think twice about camping in the woods.",10,1,3,2 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick at his best.
","Visually, one of the most stunning movies you'll ever see. Kidman and Cruise's performances are excellent. The sets are unbelievable. Kubrick at his best. The story will draw you in and never let go. You will be shocked and moved.",9,0,0,14 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," You'll be scared out of your pants.
","This movie is amazing. It will have you squirming in your seat and shouting out obscenities in a crowded theater. This is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Haley Joel Osment's performance as Cole is Oscar worthy. The end is unbelievable. Don't let anybody tell you anything about it before you see it. This movie is one of the best stories of all time. Take a girlfriend, because by the end of the movie she'll be clinging to you like peanut butter to the roof of your mouth. If you are a girl take your boyfriend. Yes guys, you'll be scared out of your pants too.",10,0,0,14 August 1999
