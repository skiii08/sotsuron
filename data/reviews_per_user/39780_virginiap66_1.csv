The Legend of Bagger Vance," 'Bagger' has a lot going for it...
","I enjoyed 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' very much.  I read the book about a year ago, and while the movie varies from the book in many instances, the overall theme of the book carries through into the movie.The beginning of the movie disturbed me, as it seemed a bit rushed and disjointed.  Once you get past the introduction (the first 30 minutes or so) the movie is great.  The photography, music, and scenery are beautiful.  The actors all did a good job.  Unlike some other reviewers, I felt like all the actors handled their roles well.  Will Smith pulls off Bagger Vance with just the right mixture of humor and sincerity.  Matt Damon as Ranulf Junnah is much as I imagined him in the book.  The 'chemistry' between Damon and Theron seemed appropriate given the storyline and the characters' past history.  I was especially impressed with J. Michael Moncrief in the role of Young Hardy and with Gretsch and McGill who play Jones and Hagen 'to a tee.'I would rate this movie an 8/10...but the 2nd half of it is a 10/10 in my opinion.  Enjoy!",8,0,1,7 November 2000
