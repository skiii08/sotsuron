Mission: Impossible III," Recommended
",I watched this film yesterday with a good friend of mine. We were only watching it because we had missed a train and nothing else looked good. I had heard bad reports about it so entered the screen fearing the worst. The beginning was amazing and really left you at the edge of your seat. All the way through the film the start ran through your head and you pondered where it would become relevant. The film was very action pact but never seemed to go o.t.t. This kept it semi-realistic and didn't force the watcher to divert and stop believing. There were many twists in the tale and this lead to a dramatic ending which was both tense and emotional. In all this film was very enjoyable (with a lot of beautiful actresses) and I did not regret paying Â£4.50 to watch.,9,2,4,15 May 2006
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The Funniest Film Ever!
","From Start to Finish this film had me rolling around the floor literally wetting myself! The obvious arrogant ness of Ron Burgandy is absolutely hilarious!! One of the first lines is 'Hey everybody come see how good i look!' So funny. Champ, the stupid jock, sport reporter is a truly comical character with his secret love attachment to Ron Burgandy! One extremely funny moment is when Ron Burgandy declares how unprepared for playing the jazz flute he is whilst he pulls out his jazz flute! But the funniest character is Brick the most random and stupid characters in movie history! His stupidly random lines get funnier as the film progresses. His random outbursts made the whole cinema crack up and fall into mad hysterics. Most of all the film brought so many funny one liners: 'I love carpet, I love desk' '60% of the time it works . . . every time!' 'Where did you get those clothes . . . the toilet store?' during a conversation 'yeah i know, i just burnt my tongue!' 'LOUD Noises!' 'Brick where did u get that grenade', . . . 'I don't know!'",10,0,2,15 May 2006
