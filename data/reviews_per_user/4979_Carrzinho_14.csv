Your Name.," A wondrous experience.
","Your Name (2016)
At its heart it's a Japanese body swap comedy drama, but there's a hell of a lot more to it than that. Our boy Taki lives in Tokyo and girl Mitsuha hails from a rural village. There are genuine moments of humour as the two teenagers wake up in each other bodies for a day at a time, a couple of times a week. They return to 'themselves' after going asleep with no memory and they try and piece together the previous day with notes left of each others phones and tales recounted by friends.
All in all seemingly a slight twist on a conventional premise but the plot becomes layered by celestial occurrences, time disparities and tragedy. What sounds complicated is wonderfully drip fed and tangible and makes for a compelling tale. The characters and friends have a warmth to them and you'll care about them.
As good as everything sounds so far the most enthralling thing is the animation. It's is right up there with the most beautiful movies i've ever seen. The village and surrounds are exquisite. The details are remarkable. The bustle and movement of Tokyo are magnificently rendered. It genuinely blurs the lines of animation and reality.
This movie is worthy of every acclaim and to be as outstandingly successful as it was in it's homeland. NINE",9,0,0,8 August 2019
Train to Busan," I have had it with these mf zombies on this mf train!!!!
","Korean Zombies (think World War Z) on a train packed with passengers desperately trying to get to Busan. A decent supply of heroes and villains are whittled down in what provides a claustrophobic environment. The limitations of the train are often cleverly exploited with fewer contrived moments. Pace plays a massive role in the movie, that of the zombies and the train, this is balanced with elements of stealth and quiet. As with the best apocalyptic movies the reactions of those in peril and the challenges to social norms are well explored. The characters are earnest and sympathetic, if at times a bit one dimensional.
It does a hell of a lot with must have been a meagre budget, and there's plenty of fun to be had on this rollercoaster. The result may not be up there with the best (28 days/weeks later) but there's something undeniably cool about watching a foreign language action movie, so you can bracket this one with Nikita and The Raid. Not necessarily in terms of quality but in kudos earned. SEVEN",7,0,3,1 September 2019
Passengers," Broadening the appeal of Sci-Fi
","Passengers (2016)
Very credible Sci-Fi. It's asking an enormous, enormous amount for 2 (3) actors to carry a two hour movie and this is its biggest triumph. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawerence are eminently engaging and endlessly watchable.
The space and science are largely believable. The dialogue and interactions work. The structure and tonal balance work.
It asks plenty of questions among others just why did anyone get on board and questions of humanity.
The film rests upon their relationship and its up to you whether this examination survives the duration but it did....just...for me, or at least I could buy it.
I felt he last 3 or 4 minutes could have been explored differently or to be honest, just explored, but maybe short and sweet was for the best rather than further 'work(ing) the problem'.
It's not its fault that it isn't the searing Sci-Fi of Arrival, the all things to everyone of The Martian or have the peril of say Gravity.
I think it's a genuine feat that this movie will acceptably cross genres and have a greater appeal than one could imagine. Broadening the appeal of a setting I love can't be a bad thing.

Spotlight," Gravity of the story, key to the movie success.
","Spotlight (2015)
This kind of movie probably lives or dies by the power of the story the reporters are trying to tell. In that respect they are unearthing a massive and shocking cover-up by the Catholic Church. It's where this movie and All the Presidents Men succeed and the broadly similar The Post fails.
The performances are hard to comment on other than they are competent and are passive to the story. This isn't about flamboyant characters.
The story itself is well structured and well paced. It's probably 20 minutes too long but then every frame that's left in gives a pathos to the labour of the journalists and so rightfully remains.
There is perhaps no real triumphant 'we got 'em' moment or crescendo like in (the inferior) The Post as we know it will be written and while damaging it won't exactly shut down the Church.
It could perhaps have dealt with some of the fallout more directly and been more prolonged than a pre credits line about the cardinal but it is the frames after that that cause the biggest intake of breath.
So perhaps because of its gravity. EIGHT",8,0,0,1 August 2019
500 Days of Summer," Refreshing take on the Rom-Com genre
","If you're going to do an indie rom-com, you're going to have to do something interesting with the formula. We are warned in the first couple of minutes by the narrator, 'This is a story of boy meets girl but be warned...this is not a love story'. It also uses the device of telling the story non-chronologically. So we're already shifting the conventional ground and all the better for it.
Zoe Deschanel and Joseph Gordon Levitt have been friends in real life for nearly a decade and this makes for a very natural relationship on screen especially as the characters spend much of the movie 'as friends'. It's not especially funny though it does contain some sharp wit and spends more time in the Rom world, but there's plenty of story here too albeit as it's not chronological it's harder to dissect.
There are moments of whimsy by the director such as a short dance sequence, use of a split-screen and another where the scene dissolves into and architects sketch but because it's not taking itself too seriously it doesn't disrupt.
It plays with our perceptions of reality of the relationship we are witnessing so conveniently greys things up and again prevents a tear down, which most rom-com plots won't survive.
The supporting cast add colour especially Clarke Gregg as Gordon-Levitt's boss and Chloe Grace Moretz as his younger sister and wise beyond her (everyones) years Agony Aunt.
The soundtrack requires mentioning as it's very avant garde and again of an indie persuasion.
In a genre I garner scant enjoyment out of, I have to consider this a big success. It's successfully unconventional and engaging while still fulfilling the role of a Rom-Com. Well done. EIGHT",8,0,2,2 September 2019
Spider-Man 3," Trilogy ends on a bum note
","Spider-Man 3 (2007)
Not much to recommend here. While i can't say i'm especially fond of the first two, they are well reviewed, this however....isn't.....correctly i might add.
Tobey Maguire is limited and can't stretch to show different side of an 'affected' Spiderman. James Franco continues to garner my ire. Kirstin Dunst is passable but better than this. Willem Dafoe is underused again though perhaps mercifully as I was always unconvinced by this character. Bryce Dallas Howard is wasted, as is Elizabeth Banks. J.K. Simmons is the only relief in this dull affair but given what he showed himself capable of elsewhere they would have been better making the film about him.
The characters are one dimensional. The plot is hopeless and full of holes. There's no shock or suspense. However, I watched this in UHD and the CGI holds together reasonably well, particularly Venom and Sandman. Neither are well acted in their normal form, but these villains are the best of this trilogy so it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't raise it's level.
At this point Spider Tobey was a spent force and in the hands of Sam Raimi, deflated the goodwill built up in what was for many, an acceptable franchise. FOUR",4,4,5,11 August 2019
"I, Tonya"," Absolutely captivating
","What absolutely makes this movie is the statement right at the beginning. This movie is based on a set of 'irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true' interviews. That's where we're at. Everybody's version of events is represented and you can make up your mind.
This device compounds what is already an incredible story and makes it even more wild and zany. The characters within are all brilliant. Any of these would steal scenes left, right and centre in any other movie. Chief burglar is Allison Janney who plays Tonya's mum. She's cruel and damaged, with a filthy mouth and absolutely hilarious.
In truth this is a very funny movie. The dim witted individuals garner much of the laughs but there's plenty of black humour too such as when Tonya's mum kicks her off a chair as a child.
This is also one of the area's where one might criticise the movie. Tonya is a victim of psychological and physical abuse at the hands of her mother and of continuous domestic abuse from her husband. This is glaringly pointed out and alarming, but so often it shifts uncomfortably tonally as we witness another jape or moment of humour.
The excellent Sebastian Stan is partly responsible too. He is undoubtedly a shameful character but often his other antics elicit sympathy.
I'm not quite sure how the director would have managed to tip toe through this mine field other than the way he does, without losing credibility or enjoyment, but it must be recognised.
A more obvious misstep is using Margot Robbie (who warranted her numerous nominations) to represent Tonya at 15. Robbie, who to me generally looks older than her years, pushes credibility here. She's absolutely acceptable at 21-23 and perfect for the 'interview' scenes filmed years after.
Whether you're familiar with the story or not, it's absolutely remarkable and 100% worth revisiting. There are interesting takes on the class barriers put up to figure skaters (and Olympians) and the infancy of 24 hour news channels and how their primary journalistic role gave way to providing opinion and entertainment.
Caveats aside you're in for a rollercoaster of 2 hours that zips along that has so much to recommend. EIGHT",8,1,1,17 September 2019
Lost in Translation," An effortless movie and an effortless joy to watch.
","Murray and Johansson give two of the most natural performances you will see. Murray who's character could conceivably be autobiographical (and perhaps is why he's so convincing) plays an 80's movie star who's career is on the wane doing some lucrative commercial work. Johansson plays a character who's been married for two years and accompanies her photographer husband on a work trip to Japan.
Both characters are struggling for sleep removed from their time zone. They're struggling with an unfamiliar city and with regret and loneliness. They find solace and kinship and relief in each other.
They are seen sometimes together sometimes apart negotiating life and fun in Tokyo. These moments feel intimate. You as the viewer feel you are there in the moment, just as lost and fascinated as our lead characters.
The pacing is almost soothing, in a bustling environment. The soundtrack is as brilliant and quirky as the city. Tokyo is just as big a star and influence on our enjoyment of this movie.
Though more classically a drama it is at times very funny indeed, albeit with a couple of obvious, if understandable pronunciation gags.
It's warm and layered and mature. It's engaging, it's not forced, it's tonally 'just so' and I'm struggling to find anything I don't like about it. Maybe that it's too dreamy, velvety and subtle to properly knock your socks off, but that is the sleepy deprived, twilight world the characters are experiencing.....so that's probably worth a mark up rather than down? NINE",9,1,2,27 August 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Lego Movie team mature....a little
","Largely enjoyed it, you could see The Lego Movie influence or should I say recognize the style. Less zany than the aforementioned, it's funny and cool and a bit more 'grown up' though thankfully no less 'out there'. It is perhaps only let down a smidge by the plot but certainly no less of a movie than the well received Homecoming. Notably good beginning and end credit sequences. 8/10",8,4,10,18 December 2018
Rocky," Plucky fighter movie
","Stallone writes and leads in this against all odds boxing drama. Rocky is stubborn, dumb and quite likeable. We get a decent foothold on the character, fighting in run down halls for a few dollars, working for a loan shark but with too much heart for his own good and down on his luck living in a beat up apartment. He's are largely popular figure in his community and desperate to date his friends sister Adrian.
All this is very convincing. The streets look authentic, as do the buildings and the circumstances. There's a lovely innocence to his burgeoning relationship with Adrian and a credibility to the bums that inhabit his world.
Giving a nobody a shot at the title is a bit of a stretch but a scene in Apollo Creeds office largely takes care of that. Later it sets an early bar for what became a ubiquitous montage and sucks you into really rooting for this underdog. The fight scenes are pretty darn good and again sets an early bar. The pacing is good as is the pathos.
However, the characters are fairly one dimensional like walking plot devices and when a character gets heated, they tend to over egg the performance.
At 2 hours it can feel at little sluggish early on but it kinds needs it to labour the mundanity of everyones lives. However, when it hits its stride it really rather zips along and the music is nothing short of inspiring. I really rather like the ending too barely acknowledging the result. SEVEN",7,0,0,16 August 2019
Zombieland," Nice riff on the Zombie genre.
","Cute riff on the Zombie genre superimposed into an affable coming of age story. Funny and engaging and featuring a truly top drawer cameo. Not much more to ask for here, it even has a post credits scene. SEVEN",7,0,0,25 July 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A major technical achievement.
","Birdman (2014)
Post middle age Riggan (Michael Keaton) twenty years past his peak movie career as action hero Birdman, is making his Broadway debut. He is directing and staring in his own adaption of a Raymond Carver story. He has gambled his life savings and his soul/sanity in an homage to Carver and a chance to make his career relevant once again and worthy as a whole.
The acting is sublime from Keaton, (daughter) Emma Stone, (fellow stage actors) Naomi Watts and a top draw Edward Norton.
They are helped by the direction that gives the perception of a movie recorded in a single take with very long scenes and non obvious cuts, though in most cases 'time' has clearly elapsed.
70% of the soundtrack is a mostly wonderful jazz drum solo (there were a couple of minutes I fell out of love with it before I confirmed) that (it) mirrors the clutter of Riggans mind (though not exclusively) heightening the crescendo of certain scenes. It really is a technical tour de force.
So what's not to like? Well not much. The story is captivating, it's well structured and there's a fascinating ambiguity to Riggan (and that's with mentioning his 'other' internal voice).
One can't help admitting it's more than a little self indulgent, though never pretentious. The story isn't wholly coherent but gets most of the way there.
It is incredibly endearing though. It's constantly funny though more dark and dry than lols. The final frames are over engineered but cute enough to confirm time well spent.
Perhaps not enough to reach the highest highs but there's so much to enjoy here. EIGHT",8,1,2,2 August 2019
Life," Perhaps a better riff on Alien(s) than recent franchise fare.
","Life (2017)
Just shy of 40 years since Alien, i think it was ok to use some of it's devices. Set in the very near future on the International Space Station gives it a brilliant reality and helps make this a properly scary movie. What helps more, is the design of 'the alien' which is at its scariest early on when the fear of the unknown looms larger than after its first reveal. The characters not being 'tooled up' brings it slightly further away from Alien, with the characters being arguably more vulnerable.
The 'Space' is done well and in comparison with other is perhaps limited by reality. Futuristic space movies don't have to be compromised by awareness of its setting. The sound is good and the tension, though never turning you foetal quite like the first scene in the lab, does maintain well.
Gyllenhaal is decent, as is the ever excellent Rebecca Ferguson, though i felt Ryan Reynolds was a bit too Deadpool and not enough ISS type. His character felt out of place, or at least should have been toned down a little.
While I was happy enough with the direction the ending took, I felt it could have been far better implemented and was the only real error for me. In conclusion it is the best space horror i've seen since the aforementioned genre topping Alien(s), so not bad at all. SEVEN",7,2,3,16 August 2019
Green Book," Buddy road movie has some extra sparkle
","An Italian-American bouncer takes up the job of driving an African-American pianist on a 2 month tour in the 1960's of America's South.
This is essentially a buddy road movie bringing to mind Midnight Run (1988) and Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987). Two opposites are placed together and we witness conflict and humour and two characters growing together. So the template is set and it largely follows true as you'd expect.
What make this different is the setting. No matter what is going on there is the palpable racial tension and real threat that could dissolve this affable caper into something altogether more heinous.
This makes it more worthy, in an actual sense and that of the Oscars. This would also be my main criticism of the movie. It feels too crowd pleasing when it could have laboured further on the fight for civil rights.
Viggo Morensen and Mahershala Ali are superb and entirely convincing. Their characters evolve and grow credibly. Linda Cardellini, who i feel is underrated provides an anchor to the story and is excellent.
It's beautifully shot, as a road movie in the south should be. The period element isn't laboured beyond the opening scenes of Tony Lip in his bouncer role but is quietly effective. The soundtrack is top drawer combining Aretha Franklin, Chubby Checker etc with the very interesting, classically influenced, jazz stylings of Dr. Donald Shirley's trio.
Tonally it's hard to argue with, shifting gear effortlessly and it really is very funny indeed. I laughed out loud nearly every time they went for the comedic schtick.
For me it hasn't got the heft of an Oscar winning movie or the uniqueness and magic of e.g. its predecessor The Shape of Water (2017) but it will be timeless, pleasing and important enough to be looked upon with fondness. EIGHT",8,2,4,19 September 2019
