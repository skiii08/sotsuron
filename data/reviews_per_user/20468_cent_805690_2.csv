The Ring," scariest movie I've ever seen!!!
","Hi there!!I watched 'The Ring' for the first time a few months ago, and let me tell you, I got the scare of my life!  I went to go see it in the afternoon so that I could have a good night sleep, instead of waking up horrified from a dream the involved a gruesome little girl coming out of a tv, so that's why I went to go see it in the afternoon!When you see the movie, at first you think: 'Wow, that was freaky!' after jumping up from your seat, but then, the movie has this way of sticking in your subconscious.  I couldn't even go by my TV at home after watching 'The Ring' withought thinking about that little girl!  And man was I terrified! Even looking in one of my mirrors at home ( which looks like the same mirror that you see Samara's (the little girl) mother brushing her hair! No joke, it's a crazy coincidence! I almost flipped after realising it!) just gave me goosebumps!Because of that movie, I also experienced one of the most scariest moments of my life, what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth, I not just saying it so that I can make the movie look good or anything, but it's really scary, and just goes to show that the movie was so well maid, that it had that much of an impact on me!Ok, it's not that long of a story, all that happened, was that I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night (approx. 3:00 in the morning) and had a nose bleed! This was on the same week that I just watched the ring, as if it was one of those signs that I was going to die.  No this was not a dream, my brother ask me the next morning what I was doing up in the middle of the night!So anyway, very freaky! Just goes to show that the movie was extremely well made, and well acted.  I hope they come out with another one just like it!

The Matrix Reloaded," What a show!!!
","GreetingsI went to see the movie on Sunday, and wow was I blown away!In the first movie, the directors really did put there technological tricks in good use, with the famous term 'matrix dodge' adding a whole new perspective on camera angles and how to really show off some sweet bullet dodging with the perspective of the one being shot at!But with this film, it took it to a whole other level, one higher might I add.  With mind blowing visual effects, such as the first scene where Trinity jumps out a window, and we show broken glass flying in bits and pieces, with the awesome sound effects to go with it!( By this time, I already began to literally drool in the theater, with my girlfriend screaming out:'EEWWW'!) Another great part, is the fighting scene ( heh, witch one? So many fighting scenes!!) where Neo is battling like 100 agent Smiths.  They really did an excellent job at rendering all the agents and making it look so real!As well as finally getting a fighting scene done right, instead of having one agent attack at a time, like in all other movies, we see like 5 agents rushing and punching there way to revenge! The way it should be done, I mean, come on, in real life, we would see a whole gang swarm around this one guy, instead of saying:'hey, eh Bill? Is it your turn to try and beat him up or is it Steve's?'...The story itself blew me away.  I remember asking myself:' I don't think the sequel is gonna be that good, I mean, the first one was all about knowing what the matrix is, so what are they gonna show us now to make an even bigger impact?' Now I know.  The very fact of having Neo find the guy who INVENTED the Matrix and the explanation of Neo's being (that he's 'the one')just adds so much more effect and understanding to the entire story!All in all, the director's did a great job at not disappointing the public with another sequel. Instead, they succeeded in bringing forth a great trilogy, by combining love, action, a little bit of comedy and an amazing tale on to the big screen!",9,0,0,20 May 2003
