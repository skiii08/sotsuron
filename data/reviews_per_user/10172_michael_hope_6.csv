Angels & Demons," A LOT better then the Da Vinci Code
","Like most people I'd already read the book 'Angels And Demons' and ever since then I'd been looking forward to Dan Brown's books to be made into movies. Of course with the flop which was 'The Da Vinci Code' I was naturally pessimistic about Angels and Demons the movie.The movie starts off with the Fisherman's ring being destroyed and the Pope's funeral. For the first 15-20 minutes of the movie definitely starts off on a down beat but as soon Robert Langdon arrives in Vatican City things start to pick up, for me, the next part of the movie is action packed and -even though I'd already read the story and so already knew what was going to happen- it was most definitely edge-of-the-seat-stuff. The last bit of the movie where all the bits and pieces are put together for both the characters and the viewer is thankfully not as action-packed. You definitely can't go into the movie expecting to just have a easy ride, you need your brains in gear to fully understand everything and to get all the points in the end because otherwise the movie will seem like just a load of sub-stories brought together into some obscure storyline.People who feel that 'The Da Vinci Code' was a let down and ruined a perfectly brilliant and best selling novel by one of the top authors of our time will be very glad to hear that 'Angels and Demons' does in fact do fantastic justice to a brilliant book.",8,4,8,15 May 2009
Skyfall," Bond is back with a Vengeance
","Bond is back, and its fantastic to see him again! Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were good but Sam Mendes- the director- has done his homework and it damn well shows! M (played by Judie Dench of course) has some enemies and they have finally come back to nip her on the butt. (Don't worry, that is all I will say about the plot!) The script is so well done, you truly do get the idea of impending doom and the only person who can save us all is 007 himself. Sure there are explosions, car chases, fights, etc but there are certainly less explosions and more of the traditional things in Bond movies.Adele's 'Skyfall' theme tune is so amazing, it gave me tingles down my spine as the sequence starts, and believe me it is at a truly epic part of the movie! All the lead characters were played so well though I thought one of the bond girls (I won't name!) was on for too short a-time and it would have been nice to see more of her, calling her a Bond girl was slightly exaggerating as she is really just a plug in a small hole in the plot.This movie truly is going back to the old style of Bond, you will find a lot more tongue-in-cheek humour, a few more of the old-Bond characters are back. However, rather than being sentimental about it, they've brought Bond into the 21st Century (after 12 years, its good of them to join us) If you are a Bond fan, this is the movie for you, its great, action packed and just fantastically British!Bring on the next instalment!",10,27,69,26 October 2012
Star Trek," Really good but could've been better
","I went to see Star Trek having hated every single series before and moaning to my dad whenever he decided he wanted to watch an episode.The movie starts off with a good old battle scene which, if I must admit was very short lived. That I find is a crucial reason why I didn't give this movie the full marks which it good've got from me. The final battle scene and the first battle scene- although uses great usage of SFX- was so short that by the time the scenes had finished, you'd only just got into them. On the other hand; it is a refreshing change from the now necessary urge of director's to make huge battle scene's which go on for over 1/2 hour, I'll let you make your own choice.Apart from this point, the movie is pretty awesome. The special effects are amazing and so are the sets. The plot centres around the rescue of the commander of enterprise and also James Kirk's urge to become the captain of the enterprise.All in all, if you want a great movie with amazing special effects then this is the movie for you. However if you want a movie with huge battle scenes. Don't bother",9,1,9,16 May 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Way too long
","I know its a stupid analysis of this epic of a movie. The whole thing was done amazingly way and it was so beautiful. The only problem was.........it was so long you were glad when the film finished! If this was maybe an hour shorter I would've given it 10/10 but it got to the point where you felt like you'd actually sat through your own lifetime having watched it.I really wanted to enjoy this, we'd gone to see it just after it had been nominated for BAFTA's and Oscar's so I thought 'Well this should be pretty good then!' Don't get me wrong, it IS an amazing movie, the special effects are amazing, the acting is amazing and the storyline was amazing. But as I've said, the length totally ruined it for me.Sorry",5,1,5,16 May 2009
La La Land," A love letter to Hollywood with a modern twist
","The first half and last scene of this film are simply, outrageously gorgeous. Amazing music, clap-your-hands-with-delight-dancing with quite the cast. It brings tears to your eyes, goosebumps to the back of your neck and a nostalgia even this 26-year-old can appreciate. The middle third/half of the film brings the modern twist to this film; it shows the audience that the optimism of youth sometimes has to give way to practicalities of life; that sometimes means that you might have to 'cash-in' to fulfil the dreams of your younger self. This I think, is a great narrative to live by, especially for the generations after mine who seek fame for fame's sake rather than attempting to be the best at something first. Now, I know some people say that there is a lot of 'mansplaining' in this film; that's for other people to decide. Since I'm a white male, I can't really comment on that. Another criticism that I had was the opening scene - as brilliant as it was - needed more......WOW factor; it's the opening of a musical, you can ramp up the volume, make things brighter and happier. Whilst it is amazing and awe-inspiring, you were straining to hear what was being said and - after the hype of this scene - you felt a bit.....meh.Another criticism has been the last scene, personally, I loved it. It's a classic 'what could have been' that everyone feels at some point in their life. The idealised view that life could have been happier and racier. However, they have gotten to where they want to be and would they have managed that whilst being together? Who knows.As the title says, this movie is a love song to classic Hollywood whilst poking fun at itself and having a liberal sprinkling of modern touches. I loved it though I do acknowledge the criticisms, some of which I accept, some I don't quite buy.",9,2,8,20 January 2017
Titanic," Simply amazing
","I am, I think, one of the few people in the world who has never seen this film in the full before today.My sister and I went to go and see the film in 3D today. I have to admit, I was looking forward as well as a bit nervous about this film. There has been so much hype, the most expensive film ever (at the time), the 11 Oscar's, THE song, etc. I just hoped to god that I wouldn't be disappointed.To those of you who haven't seen it, you MUST go and see it! From start to finish the film is amazing. At the beginning when you see the- now- famous footage of the Titanic in it's watery grave to the very end when Rose dies (?), ever single moment of the film is timeless, classic and truly amazing.I'm sure the film looked absolutely amazing when it first came out but James Cameron's painstaking remastering into HD and then the 3D added just make everything look amazing. From the start where you see the Titanic in all it's spender as the hopeful passengers wave their loved ones goodbye, to the splendid 1st class suites and til the very bitter end where you see the Titanic crash under the waves to her watery depth's. Every single scene and every single image was so crystal clear it felt like you were there. Even after 15 years, the directing of James Cameron is just superb. Yes some scenes are amazingly cheesy, but you soon forget these moments and replace them with the true emotion of the final half hour. The old couple who hug each other tightly as the water slowly rises toward them, the mother tucking their children into bed and giving them their last bedtime story and of the course the moment Rose lets Jack go whispering 'I'll never let you go'Throughout the whole first half of the film you are swept up with the happiness and pure delight on Rose and Jack's faces, you watch them from good friends to falling in love, a warm feeling surges through your body. However you always have that small, tiny niggle in your head, knowing that it wont last, the moment we see Jack, eyes closed and at peace, slips down into the darkness of the ocean is constantly in your head.This story isn't just about love found and love lost. It's about relationships, throughout the film you see different relationships. fiancÃ©, best friends, mother/daughter, father/son, parent/children, rich toff/servant. Each one, unique in it's own way, each one is precious to the two people involved. This film tugs at the heart strings because of the transformation of the happy times, all the way to the saddest and most terrible times imaginable. Combine that with James Cameron's amazing directing and the timeless score that creates goosebumps and sticks in the mind for hours after, and you have a truly remarkable film.",10,3,7,9 April 2012
