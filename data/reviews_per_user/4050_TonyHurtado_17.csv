Scarface," Al Pacino's Best!
","I finally had enough time to sit down to watch the icon Al Pacino at his best in the movie Scarface. The best mob movie I ever seen. I always thought it was one of those overrated films that only stupid Italians liked but this turned out to be one of the greatest films I have watched next to GoodFellas. Probably Al Pacino's best performance next to the Godfather. The story of this film was very well constructed, the director Brian DePalma got great shots for certain scenes throughout the film. It's basically one man who was at the bottom at the food chain of the mob rose to the top due to one job he did perfectly, then he let the power go to his head and became very successful in the mob. Allot of people and critics like those type of Movie Stories.",10,4,9,23 May 2010
Iron Man 2," Iron Man 2 Rocked the House Down!
","Many things to comment on about this epic movie. Iron Man 2 is sure to be one of the best comic films ever. It definitely was way better than The Dark Knight. The one thing that I especially liked is that they replaced the character Rhodes with Don Ceadle who is a great actor who also acted in Ocean's 11. The fight scenes were great and this wasn't one of those movies where there are way to much special effects that it makes the movie bad like Transformers 2. Mickey Rourke and Robert Downey Jr. both equally give great performances. Jon Faverou makes one of the best sequels ever. I also like that they put War Machine in the movie, which was a original character in Iron Man comic book series. 5 out of 5 for this great film.",5,3,6,23 May 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Prince of Persia, entertaining, but not the best.
","Ya know it's a little confusing with the Prince of Persia franchise. Well here's the timeline of the franchise. First they made the first Prince of Persia video game in 2003 was 'Prince of Persia the Sands of Time' which is now the movie above. So after that game they made 3 more sequels. Now in 2010 the new movie has come out. Now they took the poster of the movie and made it the cover for the new prince of Persia video game. So it's a little confusing. Now heres my review of the movie, Jake Gyllenhaal has made another great performance but it isn't as great as 'Jarhead' or 'Brothers'. I was very skeptical of this movie because many video game movies are very bad. Like the 'teenage mutant ninja turtles' movie, that was the worst, but this movie was good for a video game movie. Although the princess in the movie (Gemma Arterton) was not great in this movie, I think hey could have picked a better actress. The effects and storyline of this movie was what I thought the best and key factors of this film. If I had to give a rating on this film out of five stars I would give it a solid 6 star rating.",6,0,1,5 December 2010
The Expendables," The Expendables, is worth every penny.
","Let me just say this first, any movie with Bruce Willis from (Die Hard) Sylvester Stallone from (Rambo) and Arnold Schwarzenegger from (The Terminator) all in one room means that this will not be no frickin pussy movie. This movie was no stop action, and when I say that I mean there was not one moment of the film that did not have action.You know I really thought this movie would not do good be good because there were to many well known actors but it turned out to be one great Summer action flick. Also on one particular note, this was Terry Crews' best film in my eyes, because he has been in some bullshit Tyler Perry crap but I think after this film he is going to get some great props for his role.Also another plus for me was that this film had the best UFC fighter, Randy Couture, and one of the best WWE wrestlers Stone Cold Steve Austin in one film. I got a kick out of this when they both went at it, it was WWE v.s. UFC basically. Two other things I like was that Jason Statham and Jet Li were friends and not foes, because of one of their previous films 'WAR'. The second was that Sylvester Stallone was teammates with Dolph Lungren, because they were also foes in another film Rocky VI.This movie was a great film mixed with allot of action, adventure, suspense, thrills, and laughs. I was also impressed that Sylvester Stallone did a great job directing this film, and staring in it at the same time. I also give him props that he finished the movie after breaking his neck in one scene where Steve Austin had to push him into a wall, so props to Sylvester for accomplishing all this at once in just one frickin movie, I would give this film a 8 and star review.",4,2,5,5 December 2010
The Town," The Town, Great Movie!
","You know not allot of people say that they are excited to see a movie, but I was extremely excited for this movie to come out, since the get -go. I thought I would ruin the film for me if I continued to watch trailers and behind the scenes, but honestly it didn' reveal anything to me. I was excited for many reason's, one because my second favorite actor Jeremy Renner is in this film, I haven't seen Ben Affleck for a while, and it was from the producers of 'The Departed.'The Town is an instant classic in my book. There were no mistakes through out the progression of the film. John Hamm was perfect in his role as FBI Agent Adam Frawley. There was some comedy in the film that I enjoyed, and the good thing is that the comedy did not ruin the film. There are also some many twists and turns in the film that you have to pay attention to the film. The film has many genres, love, deceit, action, drama, and adventure.The basic gist of the story is Ben Afflecks character, Doug MacRay is trying to get out of the robbing business, he had been grown up with because of his father Stephen MacRay (Chris Cooper). Although he wants to get out he has to face many obstacles, like family, friends, FBI, and fellow robbers. James Coughlin (James Renner) is the major factor in preventing Doug from leaving the mob. He is the loose cannon, who just wants to rob rob rob.I loved this film, I truly believe it is one of the best films made in 2010. I would rate this with a solid 10 out of 10 stars for all the effort put into the film. One last thing I want to comment on is the gun fight towards the end. It was great because they included no music to make the fight seem more realistic, which I thought was a great idea. Now allot of people will say the just wanted to copy the gun fight in the movie Heat. I think they didn't, but if they did, they did a hell of a better job than Heat did so yeah I loved this film.",10,3,7,5 December 2010
Shutter Island," Shutter Island, will have you at the edge of your seat.
","This movie was indeed another classic in the Martin Scorsese legacy. Although this movie cannot compare to Casino, or GoodFellas, or the Departed it still a very well thought out a very well directed movie. Leonardo DiCaprio as yet again proved himself worthy in Shutter Island. Although this movie is very good, it is also very confusing as the movie progresses. But if you really pay attention with out looking at your phone or going to the bathroom you will understand the story completely I guarantee that.The plot goes like this, Leonardo DiCaprio is a Marshall, sent to Shutter Island with his new assistant, to find a missing prisoner, in Shutter Island, but he goes through many plot twists, turns, and unbelievable clues, in helping him figure out this case.Oh yeah if you want to know if there is anything after the credits there isn't anything.",8,0,1,5 December 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Bourne Ultimatum, best Bourne installment.
","My favorite Bourne movie in the series. The Bourne Ultimatum was awesome, it topped all the other Bourne movies. It has so much action, more action then the other two. This was very fast-paced, I think they probably filled in all the unsolved answers from Supremacy. I hope they didn't answer all the questions because I would very much like Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon make another film. They also brought back actors like Joan Allen and Julia Stiles but they brought in David Strathairn as Noah Vosen.The plot goes as this, Bourne tries to find a journalist who continues to write stories about Bourne's past including Marie's death. He tries to track him down but the journalist was also wanted by the CIA in New York, so the CIA sees Bourne with him so Bourne is yet again tracked down by the CIA. The only reason Bourne was after the journalist because he wanted answers on who started Bourne's assassin ways. So while looking for answers he also has to deal with CIA.Now in my Supremacy blog, I said I would discuss the same conversation in both films. At the end of Supremacy there is a conversation between Bourne and Pam, this conversation also happened in the middle of Ultimatum. This conversation was the way that they were able to continue with Ultimatum. So the 1st half of Ultimatum is a quarter of material of Supremacy they wanted to use in Ultimatum instead of Supremacy. So basically the conversation is a lead into Ultimatum. I thought it was a clever move. 5 out of 5 stars again for The Bourne Ultimatum. To leave off if Paul or Damon sees this blog I hope they will listen to a die hard Jason Bourne fan to make another film because I really want to see a fourth film.",10,3,4,5 December 2010
The Bourne Identity," The Bourne Identity, my favorite film of all time.
","As you can tell I am a huge fan of The Bourne series because of the fact that Matt Damon is my favorite actor and that I own the movies on DVD and Blu Ray, now on with the review. Allot of people thought at first that this was going to be a rip off of James Bond but they were sadly mistaken. It turned out to be one of the greatest films of 2002. It was rated #8 out of the Top 10 films of 2002. This was a great movie, to say the least every opportunity was taken which made it very successful. I say that this film made Matt Damon's career, not to say he didn't have great movies before that, but this movie was his best in my eyes. Him playing the character Jason Bourne made his career.The story was brilliant too because it had not been used so far in any other movie that I know of. I am not going to spoil the movie but I will just give a little summary. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is highly trained spy who loses his memory, but just because his memory is lost doesn't mean the agency that hired him forgot about him. So he is put through many obstacles because his agency tries to terminate him because of a failed mission. This movie is filled with action and adventure, it also had a great cast. Besides Matt Damon they had Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles.My favorite scene in the entire film would have to be The Mini Cooper chase. I thought it was well edited and well directed by Doug Liman. The action was perfect in this scene, when I was younger I would constantly watch that scene, I would fast forward all the way to that scene and just watch that scene. It completely obvious how many stars I give this film and that would be 10 out of 10 stars.",10,2,2,5 December 2010
Salt," Salt, is great like pepper.
","Another great Summer blockbuster. The funny thing about this movie is that this movie came out during when the whole Russian Spy's in America were captured in real life. Anyways besides that funny fact, this movie was simply awesome. It was truly Jolie's comeback, even though she really didn't take a break from acting, I'm just saying it is her comeback to a leading role in an action flick. The movies focus was on the feud and history between Russia and America, which is a topic people still talk about. It is one of those movies that sort of explains how Russia feels about America. It also deals with nuclear power, and what would go on in a situation of that power.It is quite a confusing movie, but you start to understand as the movie progresses. This movie is a type of movie where you think one thing is going to happen but something else occurs. It is also in a certain way a who done type deal. The characters can also confuse you. The one character that you don't know what they are thinking is definitely Jolie's character. You can't tell whether she is a spy or not, she does one thing that makes her seem evil, but then it turns into a good thing.This movie reminded me a whole lot like the Bourne movies because of the action and suspense and a mix of the actual feud between America and Russians. Anyways 4 out of 5 stars for this summer blockbuster.",7,1,3,28 January 2011
District 9," District 9, gets a 9 out of 10.
","Finally I had enough time to sit down and watch this movie that has been on my most anticipated films list. It was one of the greatest films ever made. It is like a better version of Cloverfield. Although instead of placing the film in a famous city it is in Johannesburg, and instead of just a monster this movie deals with aliens. It stars of as a fictional documentary of how the aliens came about and then the movie switches into the aliens and the humans sides of the story, which I thought was brilliant. The computer animations were insane. Also just want to point out to anyone who is grossed out easily that you should not watch this film because there are some pretty hardcore gross scenes throughout the film. Any ways 9 out of 10 stars for this film.",8,3,7,5 December 2010
Inception," Inception, will blow your mind.
","This was without a doubt a perfect film. Christopher Nolan is on a roll, first The Dark Knight and now Inception. This is another movie where you can't talk, text or go to the bathroom during the progression of the film. This movie was simply mind-blowing, I knew that this was going to be a excellent film by just looking at the poster. This was also an all-star cast, with some heavy hitters like Leonardo Dicaprio and Michael Caine, and some great up-coming actors like Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Joseph caught me by a major surprise, his acting was superb. Also I was surprised that the movie would end out in a 'Cliff Hanger', I'm not going to say what happens in the film because I don't want to ruin for you guys because the movie is to good to just read the spoilers. Anyways 10 out of 10 stars.",7,0,5,5 December 2010
Despicable Me," Despicable Me, cutest movie of 2010
","Possibly the cutest movie I ever seen. I always just thought this was just going to be another animated comedy but, it was a terrific movie. With Steve Carell leading a team of other great actors like Will Arnet, Miranda Cosgrove, Jason Segal, and Russel Brand really put the movie in a great spot to become a close to perfect movie. The character that I think that will capture every one's heart is Agnes played by Elsie Fisher. Another thing that was a key factor in the film was the little yellow minions, they are also pretty cool. Steve Carell is also the main factor because without him this movie wouldn't have come about. So just to give a rating out of 10 I would give it a 8.",8,0,1,5 December 2010
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3, is the best animated film ever!
","I have waited 10 years for this to finally come, finally Pixar has concluded the Toy Story franchise with Toy Story 3. Although Toy Story 3 was funny at times the movie was also very touching especially at the end. The end was the saddest part of the whole movie, I admit I shed a slight tear because it reminded me that growing up has it's perks but also it's downs. One of it's downs is that you start to miss the good old days where you felt like you can do anything and that you cant enjoy your toys like you used to. Anyways besides the sadness Toy Story 3 is an instant classic. Probably the best movie of the year and best movie of the summer of 2010. I would give it 10 out of 10 tars for the excellence in the story, the animation and just the movie itself. This movie will probably be considered one of the best films ever created as time progresses.",9,1,3,28 January 2011
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Nightmare on Elm Street, classic Horror film.
","A classic film to watch on Halloween night, 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'. The classic film directed by Wes Craven, the classic Horror director. This film was always a fun thing for me to watch, me and my friends love to watch it during Halloween night. Robert Englund will always and forever be the best Freddy Krueger.Although this movie may seam terrible now, it was a sure classic in the 8O's, and it still is for die hard Elm street fans. The story wasn't great I have to admit it was a little rough around the edges. I believe the remake had a better story than the original, but the original was still better in other ways.Basically the story is that all these kids on Elm Street are having the same dream of Freddy trying to kill these teenagers, for no reason. In many ways the kills were awesome especially Johnny Depp's character's death, I won't say what it is for people who haven't seen it. I give this film a 7 out of 10 star review. Continue reading my posts this countdown for more Halloween action.",8,0,1,5 December 2010
Get Him to the Greek," Get To The Greek, and make us laugh.
","Another comedy classic. They took two of the most promising comedic actors and put them together to make one great film. The one thing that I was not expecting was P Diddy being that great of a comedian. P Diddy was hilarious and laugh out loud funny, I had a hard time controlling my laughter to all his jokes and segments. Russel Brand also makes another great performance by bringing back his character Aldous Snow who was also in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Jonah Hill however, yet he was funny he lacked in the field of jokes. All of the top jokes, go to P Diddy and Russel. I thought that he could be a little more funny. I'm not saying he was terrible he was just OK. Anyways I suggest seeing this movie soon because it is sure to be a classic. 6 out of 10.",6,0,3,5 December 2010
The Social Network," The Social Network, was a great network of success.
","You know many people are always skeptical when there is a movie where it involves a website or a certain or based on something involving this society we live in. The reason people don't think this movie could work is because it is based on the global phenomenon facebook.I in all honestly don't become skeptical towards these types of films. I personally believed that this film has a huge chance at winning at least one Oscar this year. Either for best picture, best actor, or best supporting actor.Jesse Eisenburg was spectacular at portraying the genius and or just a crazy kid willing to do anything to do what he thinks is right. Justin Timberlake was also good, this was probably his best film. Unlike his other films Justin was serious and top notch at his role as the creator of Napster (Sean Parker), but the actor who was absolutely perfect was Andrew Garfield.Garfield was amazing he really set the stone for this film his acting I believe is what boosted this movie even more than it already was. The story itself is unbelievable because it shows you how FaceBook, came about, and shows how Mark Zuckerberg was what some people would say an evil genius, I personally believe that Mark was just a misunderstood kid who wanted to prove he was better and capable than anyone else in his field of expertise.Although I did catch one mistake in the film, there was a reference to Snooki from the 'Jersey Shore'. The thing is the reference was made during the timeline in the movie which was at least either 2006 or 2007 at the point of the reference. 2006-2007 there wasn't even a thought of Jersey Shore because it wasn't created back then. If they didn't make the mistake so obvious I would have given the movie a 10 out of 10 star review, but I dropped it to a 9 stars out of 10 star review. Overall it was a pretty good movie.",10,1,2,29 January 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Supremacy, a sequel that worked.
","This wasn't my favorite film and or installment in the Bourne movies but it was still great. The BourneSupremacy answers some questions left unanswered in the first film. Although you won't know everything till you watch the third film. This film I think wasn't more on the action/adventure side and had more drama so the story could continue properly and as smooth as possible. The film I think was well shot, and even though Doug Liman did A great job on the first film I think Paul Greengrass the director of this film and Ultimatum. Paul has also directed Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Green Zone. Paul got the opportunity to direct thee film because Liman left the project as director and became a producer for this film.This film also had another great car chase scene, which I thought was also the best scene in the film. Besides these car chases I love how faster, smarter, and more slick in this film after regaining some of his memory. The plot goes as this, after the first film, Bourne intends to leave his past of an assassin and lead a new life but, Ward Abbot (Brian Cox) frames Bourne for a murder so there would be no leads to him as an accomplice of TreadStone. After being framed and losing his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) he decides to hunt down anyone involved in framing him. He then runs into some new and past people like Nicky (Julia Stiles) and Pam Landey (Joan Allen) who thinks at first Bourne is the enemy but looks more into it to discover he isn't.There was one scene that they use also in The Bourne Ultimatum, same conversation and everything but, I'll get into to that in my next review. This movie really enticed people for Ultimatum to come out because, it is a semi cliff hanger, I'm not saying what it is you will have to watch it to find out. This movie was very creative and well written in a way that really makes you feel your in the movie. I also give this film a 10 out of 10 stars.",10,1,2,5 December 2010
