The Hangover," I simply loved it!!!!!
","I wasn't sure whether i really wanted to see this movie, but after loads of pushing I saw this with my friends... and i loved it. The story is too good and the comedy along with the timing is awesome. Well it is all boys out comedy and I think every man on this earth would love watching this comedy. All four main characters are well casted and the acting is superb. the direction is cool too... and most of the story and the screenplay... one has to laud these factors ... because along with the laughters it brings a strong story which grips the audience completely... so grab ur best friends and have a bash with this film...",9,12,22,21 July 2009
