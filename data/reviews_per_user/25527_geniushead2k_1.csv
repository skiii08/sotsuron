Requiem for a Dream," Let me be speechless
","When I finished this movie, I was literally out of breath.  I sat still, in my bed, trying to understand what had just happened as the credits scrolled by to an eerie silence.  It took me half the credits to regain my wits. This film absolutely shocked me, riveted me, cut a line straight through my cinematic knowledge and theory and directly into my heart.  Not many films can truly touch me, but this I was completely lost in this one.  I had to pop in Showgirls to clear my mind and try to get to sleep.  And oh, Ellen Burstyn-- why she did not win Best Actress, I don't know.  Nothing against Julia Roberts, but Erin Brockovich was nowhere near as complex or personal a character as Sara Goldfarb, and she played it so well, so chillingly well, OH MY GOD!!!!On the plus side, I will never ever do drugs.  Ever.  EVER.  Especially coke, heroin, and speed.",10,0,0,15 August 2001
