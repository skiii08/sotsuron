Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Second part of as three plus hour movie.
","Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) was the second half of a three hour plus movie that was directed by Quentin Tarantino (the action scenes were directed by Yuen Woo-Ping). Since nobody wanted to watch a nearly four hour grind house movie, the producers decided to split the movie in half and put all the left over footage in part two. In doing so the movie feels very bloated and the film tends to drag in many places.The Bride is nearing the end of her long road to vengeance. With only the last two members of the DiVas hit squad left to dispatch (Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen) complications arise during the trip. She still has certain feelings for her former mentor. Can she push them aside and finish her mission?Extremely disappointing second half of the Kill Bill saga. Instead of continuing the total comic book carnage of the first film, Quentin Tarantino caved into pressure from the critics and made a pseudo chick flick masquerading as an action/revenge film. Whatever momentum he built whilst making the first film died on the vine in this pretentious film. Too bad because part one was actually quite good. But when this tripe hit the streets (it took forever with Q.T. constantly tinkering with the finished product) it just sat their and stunk. Highly disappointing.",3,3,8,5 March 2005
Scarface," Revenge of the 80's: The remakes
","Scarface (1983) as everyone already knows is a part of American popculture.  This remake of the great film noir/gangster picture has'modernized' the original plot and pumped up the violence and at the time set the record for obscenity in a major Hollywood production.  Instead ofbeing an Italian immigrant, this time Tony his a refugee from Cuba, insteadof Beer it's Cocaine (during this time period American was in the midst of amajor cocaine hangover that spread from the late 70's and into the 80's).The film overall is basically the same as the original but not as good and it's extremely bloated (i.e the film is almost three hours in length).  That doesn't mean the film is not entertaining or interesting.Highly recommended for camp value and sheer violence.A",8,0,1,12 June 2004
Gremlins," Revenge of the 80's: Gremlins!! A Joe Dante Film.
","Gremlins (1984) was a strange fantasy film from Roger Corman protégé Joe Dante. He creates a film that pays homage to the science-fiction films of the fifties. The film was so successful, it spawned a line of merchandise, a couple of video games and a highly successful sequel. A middle aged inventor (Hoyt Axton) is searching for a perfect Christmas present for his son. One day he comes across an Asian curio shop. He falls for the store owner's unique pet. After an unsuccessful business deal with the shop's owner (Keye Luke) his young assistant sells the pet to him. Before parting he tells him the rules of the 'Mogwai'. Never get him wet, keep him out of light and NEVER feed him after midnight. Delighted, he takes the pet home. His kid (Zach Galligan) falls in love with his new pet. But being a stupid kid, following set rules is not as easy as it seems. Co-stars Phoebe Cates (wow) and Roger Corman stock player Dick Miller.A fun film for all ages. But keep the real young ones away. Several scenes will scare them silly. Followed by an equally as entertaining sequel.Highly recommended.",8,1,3,22 August 2005
Ali," Overrated and flawed remake of 'The Greatest'.
","Ali (2001) was an overrated film by Michael Mann. Will Smith was not right for the role of Ali, despite what people say. He just didn't have the aura of 'The Greatest'. I don't think that they should make bio-pics on people who are still alive. You have to cater to certain crowds, try not to offend the living and tip toe around facts and issues. With that said, I felt that the real star of this movie was Jamie Foxx. He should real acting talent in this movie as the infamous Drew 'Bundini' Brown. His performance alone is worth a glimpse at this other wise overrated film. I'd recommend THE GREATEST instead of this movie. At least you get to see Muhammed Ali and his real circle of friends act their parts instead of this revisionist tripe.Mediocre, worth a viewing though. I have one questioned I would like to have answered. What ever happened to Ali's brother. If you watched a lot of his interviews and footage of him in public, his brother is always with him. He's rarely shown in this movie. That's not right. Another flaw that I would like to point out.",5,1,3,20 August 2005
The Ring," You will die of brain rot after you see THE RING!!!
","Cheap thrills. That's a summary of the entire film. The Ring (2002) is a dumbed down Hollywood version of the Japanese horror film Ringu (1999). The Ring is actually two movies in one, it combines both elements of Ringu and Ringu 2. Instead of making a straight horror ghost story like the Japanese version, The Ring suffers from the old scheme of trying too hard. Yes, it tries to be scary, hip and an instant classic. The movie fails on all three levels. The subliminal scenes are of old hat nature, adding elements to this film that were not in the original damage the film's chill factor and the liberal amounts of cheap scares land this movie right in the middle of Cheeseville.Naomi Watts is several years older than the character is suppose to be and by literally transposing scenes from the Japanese version will not make any sense to most of the audience giving Ms. Watts the aura of being a bad parent. The child in the movie is too cold for his own good and the father character is bad. I did not enjoy the film when I first saw it and after viewing it recently I still don't. Why mess with a good thing? Why did they have to add the t&a factor into the picture? Not only is the film bad but cheap as well. Not recommended.",3,1,3,26 November 2003
Spartacus," The World of Stanley Kubrick: Director for hire.
","Spartacus (1960) was a director for hire gig for Stanley Kubrick. Kirk Douglas was in a pinch for his next film project. He was making an epic film about a slave in the roman republic who rebels against his masters. Anthony Mann stepped down from the director's chair and Mr. Douglas needed someone to take over. Enters Stanley Kubrick. Although he has little creative input (i.e. script and story wise) he manages to make a compelling movie with his keen eye and directorial abilities.Filmed in a grand scope and in such great detail, Spartacus is eye candy for fans of epic film making. I can only imagine what the film would have been like if he had total control over the project. Kirk Douglas is the man as Spartacus, Tony Curtis is quite good as his sidekick, Charles Laughton is wise and witty as the elder senator, Peter Ustinov is a hoot in his role as the poor victim of fortunate (and unfortunate) circumstance and Sir Laurence Olivier shows why he was the premier actor of his day as Crassus.Highly recommended for Kirk Douglas fans and Stanley Kubrick philes.",8,55,79,30 July 2005
Inglourious Basterds," A mediocre effort from Tarantino. Nothing but a pastiche of films and silly sitcom dialog
","I saw Inglourious Basterds at a midnight screening and I was unimpressed with the movie. Seems like Tarantino has run out of ideas and sharp dialog. He promised a war movie in the style of an Italian western. All I saw was a pastiche of Italian westerns, bad humor and long drawn out dialog that lacked any of his previous films unique wit. Being a fan of pop culture Tarantino peppers the script with a lot of it from the 30's and 40's (yes it seems really forced). If you have seen a lot of Italian westerns, then you'll know what you're in for. Long panning camera shots, close ups of eyes and even longer wide shots. The actions scenes are few and scattered throughout the film. What I really didn't like about the film itself was that it's too helter skelter. One minute it's serious and the second it's silly with a lot of inane dialog and boring chatter that took over ten years to write (according to QT)..The characters were not that interesting. Shoshana (played by Melanie Laurent) is the main character and the film centers around her involvement in the underground. She come off cold and not all that interesting. Colonel Landa (Christoph Waltz) is the 'Jew Hunter' but he comes off like a Teutonic Columbo (I kid you not) and really mugs and overacts for the camera. The Basterds (led by Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine) are marketed as being the central characters of the film. But their appearances are too few and far between. Pitt's character's accent and personality comes off cartoonish and it really doesn't work. Eli Roth is not a very good actor and his character 'The Bear Jew'is very wooden. He's a good filmmaker who should stay behind the camera. Mike Myers guest role as a British officer is pretty bad and the audience was laughing along every time he spoke.I wish the movie was made as a farce but I don't think that was Tarantino's intentions. He tried to make a 'spaghetti western war movie'. But it comes off like a real pedestrian effort that's caters to an audience that's not his. This film felt like his first ever mainstream movie. I was really stunned by how bad this movie is. The lighting is real annoying. I know Robert Richardson loves the whole 'halo light' thing but it can be very distracting. The QT fan boys will fall all over themselves for this one because when he says jump they always say 'how high?' I don't know how well this movie will do at he box office but what I do know is that he needs a hit big time to re coop the money lost for Grindhouse (which I really enjoyed). Tarantino used to fire on all cylinders, even in his so-so movies (Kill Bill Vol.2) but this one has my scratching my head going 'what the hell did I just watch?'Several of Tarantino's trademarks appear in this film such as 'The Mexican Stand-Off', pop culture references (albeit 30's and 40's), a bare foot scene (QT has a well known foot fetish) and the n-bomb is dropped a few times in the film (don't ask how they managed to work that into the movie).",5,42,90,21 August 2009
Kickboxer," Revenge of the 80's: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Superstar.
","Kickboxer (1989) was another in a long line of star vehicles for the 'Muscles from Brussels'. In this picture J.C.V.D. plays the younger brother of a unbeaten American kick boxer who lusts for some real competition. So he decides to go to the home of Muay Thai kick boxing, Thailand. There he realizes that he doesn't know squat about the true art of kick boxing. He learns a painful lesson. His younger brother decides to learn Muay Thai and avenge his brother's honor.Not a bad movie. Entertaining and a good time waster. But for some reason the producers decided to franchise out this series. The rest of the films are a mixed bag at best. The more they made the least interesting they became until the final results were unwatchable. As always with these films the first film is usually the best of the bunch. Jean-Claude plays his character with a thick euro-accent (I forgot how they explained it). He's physically impressive so it's kind of hard to swallow his naiveté about fighting and what not. Or well. Fun for all.Recommended.",7,33,39,11 October 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Remake Mania: Dawn of the Dead
","Dawn of the Dead (2004) was pretty good. I was very surprised when I saw this movie on V.C.D. a few months back. I have to say that I was very impressed. The script by James Gunn and the direction was on par with the original. Ving Rhames was the man. He played his role quite well and was creditable as the tough cop. The set pieces were up to snuff and the gore effects were excellent.A strange mutation has quickly spread across the land. It hit so fast and so hard that nobody was prepared for what was to come. Society collapsed along with the military and the government's ability to try and contain the situation. Thousands of the living dead roam the streets and what's left of the survivors are either squabbling, bickering or killing each other off. A local mall as become a magnet not only for survivors but for the hungry and ever growing horde of the living dead. A nurse, cop, a family man and a young couple seek refuge in the mall that's under the control of three security guards who are still 'on duty'. Can any of them make it through the 'dawn' so they can survive another 'day'?Like I said before hand. A very good remake of the original. Instead of trying to do a scene for scene remake or an 'inspired' by version, the film makers wisely incorporated both elements to create this release. I haven't seen the new director's cut yet but from what I have already watched I have to say that I'm very impressed. Impressed indeed!Highly recommended!AKeep an eye out for three stars from the original film. A nice treat fro fans of the original film.",8,0,0,31 October 2004

After the severe beating he took from Drago in Part IV (any normal human would've perished from acute trauma of the brain). Rocky now must face life outside the glamorous lifestyle of being a rich and successful boxer. He must also come to terms with several things one of them happens to be the sudden growth spurt of his son. As usual the deck is stacked up against Rocky. Will he be able to overcome adversity?

Hostel," Sick and twisted release from Eli Roth
","Hostel (2005) is the first part of the surprise horror hit Hostel series. Made on a relatively small budget, Hostel is one of the many 'torture horror' films that were made following the success of the Saw series. he movie follows a trio of young guys looking for fun and pleasure in Europe. After a stop in Holland, the guys meet a ratty looking Eastern European dude who suggest that they go and party in Slovakia. Taking the weird dude's suggest, they head off to a weekend they'll never forget.I wasn't a big fan of Eli Roth's first film so I was very hesitant about seeing this one. But I was very pleased after seeing it. Hardcore horror is back.Recommended for horror fans",8,1,2,8 March 2009
Blade," The Blade Franchise: The first film!
","Blade (1998) was the first film of the Blade franchise. Loosley based upon a character that appeared in Tomb of Dracula. Blade (Wesley Snipes) is the son of a vampire. Half human and half vampire, he's what you would call a day walker. But he needs to feed on blood in order to survive. The movie follows Blade as he prepares to wage war on the vampires. Within the vampire organized society, there's a struggle for power. Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) wants to become the new leader. Dragonetti (Udo Kier) doesn't want to relinquish his title so easily. Will Blade destroy the living dead blood suckers? How does Deacon convince Dragonetti to give up his title? Do they change a lot of Blade's original character? To find out you have to watch BLADE!!An interesting loosely based on the Marvel Comic Book character. This movie was successful enough to renew interest in making Marvel Comic superheroes into silver screen giants! Followed by the superior BLADE II.Recommended for horror comic book fans.",7,1,16,23 August 2005
Alexander," The Cinema of Oliver Stone: Alexander.
","Alexander (2004) was a near perfect dramatic recreation of the life Alexander the Great of Macedonia. Oliver Stone spent a lot of time, money and effort to bring a somewhat accurate depiction of the life and times of one of the greatest military minds of all time. This is not GLADITOR or TROY. Keep this in mind. People have slammed this movie for wasting money and no making it back when it was released in the United States. Obviously the money was well spent. The scenery, sets and costumes reflect that in great detail. I also loved the way the marble statues were painted (just like in real life) and how realistic Alexander's body armor looks so much like the way it does in his mosaics.Colin Farrell stars as Alexander, a complex and conflicted individual who's torn between trying to win his father's respect and his mother's love. Val Kilmer was perfect as King Philip of Macedonia but Angelina Jolie was questionable (but still hot) as Alexander's mother. Jared Leto co-stars as Farrell's best friend and lover. Rosario Dawson (filled out and looking lovely) as his Asiatic bride. The film is bookended by Anthony Hopkins who guest starred as Ptolemy the elder. Filled with two great battle scenes and a lot of drama and excess. You want to know more about Alexander the Great and watch a very good bio-pic? Grab a copy of Alexander today!Despite a few liberties with reality and some actors miscasts in their roles, this is a great movie. I don't know why people have problems with the homosexual overtones. Hey, it's part of the man's life. Oliver Stone sought out the best historians who could find to work on this production. An epic film filled with beautiful imagery, realistic battle scenes and great direction.Highly recommended.",9,2,10,28 August 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The World of Stanley Kubrick: Doctor Strangelove...
","Doctor Strangelove (1964) was another dark black and white comedy that Kubrick directed. Filmed and produced right after Lolita, Kubrick decided to work with the enigmatic actor Peter Sellers. This time he plays three different characters (an R.A.F. officer, President Muffley and Doctor Stranglove). George C. Scott co-stars as a manic gum chewing general, Slim Pickens as the S.A.C. bomber pilot (playing the role as straight as an arrow) Sterling Hayden playing the crazed airbase commander Jack D. Ripper, and a early appearance from James Earl Jones as a bomber air man.The story is about an airbase commander who snaps and thinks the communists have infiltrated the U.S. by poisoning the drinking water and seals of the base and sends it's S.A.C. bombers on a mission to destroy the U.S.S.R. This emergency leads to an international incident when the president of the United States is notified by the premier of the Soviet Union and their ambassador about a self defense mechanism that they have developed. Once a nuclear weapon has detonated in their airspace it will go off setting a chain reaction of thermonuclear destruction. Can the U.S. government stop this rogue general? Can they knock the bomber out of commission? How does Peter Sellers handle all three roles? You'll have to find out for yourself by watching Doctor Strangelove.I have to give this movie one of my highest recommendation possible award. one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen. Knowledge about the Cold War will make it even funnier! 'We'll meet again.....'",10,1,3,30 July 2005
Scary Movie 2," A rushed into production sequel: Scary Movie 2.
","Scary Movie 2 (2001) was obviously rushed into production. The humor was nothing more than a bunch of dated jokes and references. It's a shame really because the story had promise. They should have waited until Marlon Brando was well enough to perform the part of the Exorcist Priest. His presence alone could have saved this movie. The part was written for him. When an out of place James Woods took over the role, the movie was doomed from the start.The film makers should have just waited for a little longer to release this sequel. I heard of striking while the iron is hot but this was ridiculous. But this movie is a classic compared to the horrible third film (that the Wayan Brothers wanted no part of).Mediocre effort, worth a look.",6,0,5,18 August 2005
Blade II," The Blade Franchise: Blade II
","Blade II (2002) was better than the first film. The perfect sequel that's filled with blood, gore and kinetic graphic violence. Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the day walking vampire slayer. This time around, a new threat is emerging that can destroy everyone (including vampires). After a rough night of slaying the undead, a group of the largest Vampire Clan wants a meeting with the man. They give him an offer that if he refuses will spell the end of life as we know it. Factoring in Blade' hated for the undead this'll be a tough decision for him to make. What will he do?Blade II was a wild film that was keenly directed by Spanish film maker Guliermo Del Toro. Add fight director and actor Donnie Yen into the mix, you have a movie that far surpasses the first film. Followed by the disappointing and useless BLADE III.Highly recommended.",9,0,13,28 August 2005
Alien," One of the scariest films I have ever seen!
","Alien (1979) was one of the first films to take a horror elements and successfully place it within a sci-fi picture!  A space cargo ship is out in the middle of space searching for salvage and what nots picks a distress signal from another ship.  The alien ship has crashed landed on some good forsaken rock in the dead of space.  When they land upon the desolate planet, the crew picks up a very unwelcomed visitor.Great stuff and highly recommended.  Like most popular genre films this one started a movie franchise and a number of knock-offs. Sci-fi movies were never the same after this was released.  An essential film for any true horror movie buff or sci-fi junkie.  This movie launched the career of Sigourney Weaver and director Ridley Scott.  A psuedo-remake of the seminal sci-fi film It! The Terror Beyond Space.  Elements from Dark Star (also written by the screenwriter) appear in this one as well.A+'In space, no one can hear you scream!'",8,0,1,21 June 2004
Battleship Potemkin," A true Masterpiece from Eisentstein
","Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid masterpiece. The direction ofEisenstein is truly a sight. The film chronicles a ship of disgruntledsailors who are tired of being mistreated by their superior officers.Eventually, the sailors finally have enough of the abuse and send theofficers packing. During this time period, there was a shortage of filmstock in the Soviet Union. The goverment wanted to get their messageout to the people so they started a National Film Company and one ofthe members was Sergei Eisenstein. The films were shot on minisculebudgets and the shortage of film stock forced Eisentein to be carefuland selective with the footage that he shot. In the end, Eisenstein hadto reuse footage in order to make a feature length picture.The most famous of the action set pieces in this film is the muchtalked about massacre on the steps. This scene was spoofed in Bananas and most recently in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables. If you want tolearn film-making, I strongly advise you to watch Battleship Potemkin.It's one of the essentials.A+",10,41,62,5 October 2003
Taxi Driver," The films of Martin Scorsese: Taxi Driver.
","Taxi Driver (1976) was a very controversial film from the team of Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader. The movie shows the decay of the inner boroughs of Manhattan and the decline of a disturbed individual's mind. A former Viet-Nam vet turned cab driver (Robert De Niro) is roaming the streets watching the world go to pot. The line between fantasy and reality is ever blurring because of his mental status. Slowly over time he imagines that society needs someone who will clean the streets and get rid of the vermin that runs rampant. After having a falling out at an attempt to have a normal relationship with a w.a.s.p.y woman (Cybil Shepard), he decides to become a young prostitute's savior (Jodie Foster) and bump off her sleazy pimp (Harvey Keitel). After trying to impress his ex-girlfriend by nearly killing her political employer, the cabbie decides to go out in a blaze of glory whilst confronting the pimp and the prostitute's client in a nearby flop house. Instead of being locked up in a loony bin, he's proclaimed a hero.A strange film from Scorsese. It was made during the last phase of his innovative career. After this film, he went on to direct more subtle fair. Paul Schrader would become Hollywood's next wunderkind and have a brilliant (but short) career himself. Even today, this movie is still rife with controversy. The inflammatory racial content and views of mental illness still ruffle people's feathers.Highly recommended!",9,0,0,10 August 2005
Over the Top," Nope, this is not a movie about Motorhead.
","Over The Top (1987) is a awful movie about a dumb-as-a-bag-of-rocks trucker who also happens to be an arm wrestler. This film was made during the short lived arm wrestling craze that lasted during the mid-80's. Stallone learns that while he's on the road heading towards the big wrasslin' tournament that his estranged ex-wife is ill and she wants their child (a snotty little kid)to bond with daddy. Nothing to recommend in this picture. Besides being a real bad movie, there's nothing worth mentioning. Another 'winner' from Cannon Films.D-",4,1,6,19 November 2003
Barry Lyndon," The World of Stanley Kubrick: A young rapscallion makes good in 18th century Europe.
","Barry Lyndon (1975) has to be Stanley Kubrick's most realized project that he has ever taken. A big task for the maverick director. For a film like this to be made during the free wheeling seventies had to take some big stones. One must admire Mr. Kubrick for even trying to produce and direct such a complex and expensive film that had all the ear markings of a financial and personal disaster. Not only did Kubrick manage to out do his last epic '2001' but he has created a movie that not only showcases the untapped acting abilities of Ryan O'Neil, but a beautifully lensed film that uses minimal lighting , gorgeous sets, perfect balance, positioning and meticulous timing. I have never seen such a magnificent film such as this one. Every shot and frame plays out like an eighteenth century oil painting.A young Irish man of lower class has the strangest quirk of luck. After participating in an illegal duel, young Barry is forced to flee from his home village. After being accosted by some gentlemanly highway robbers, Barry winds up cross country and becomes a conscripted soldier. Rising in rank, Barry is sent to fight in the Seven's Year War. Whilst in battle he watches his friends and fellow soldiers being slaughtered in combat due to poor tactics and leadership. Having enough of this life of hardship and struggle, Barry uses his god given talents to do what he has to do in order to survive and become a man of proper social standing.I was very impressed with this movie. I've put off watching this film until recently. Some have told me how long and boring this movie was. Others have said it was pretty self serving and not worth watching. But after seeing part of it on T.C.M., I just had to find a copy of my own. The film is over three hours in length but they go by very quickly because Barry's story is so captivating. Kubrick poured his heart and soul into this film. The results are on the screen. He's clearly a master film maker. His reputation is cemented forever with this movie. Ryan O'Neil impressed the hell out me with his role as Barry Lyndon. He gives the character some dignity and depth that no other actor could have possibly given to the title role.Overall I would have to give this film one of my highest recommendations. This is one of my top ten films of all time. If people tell you not to watch this masterpiece ignore them. I advise you to get a copy and enjoy. For a film like this you need to set aside a weekend afternoon to fully appreciate a film such as this. Believe me you will not regret it.Highest recommendation possible.It doesn't matter whether you watch it on D.V.D. or V.C.D. because the transfers are excellent on either format.",10,209,264,3 November 2004
Full Metal Jacket," The World of Stanley Kubrick; Full Metal Jacket.
","Full Metal Jacket (1987) was Stanley Kubrick's entry into the Vietnam War movie sweepstakes that occurred during the eighties. But to be fair to Stanley Kubrick he planned out this film many moons before the others. But due to his infamous lengthy pre-production schedules, this one took forever to be released. The entire film was shot in England (his new home)and all the sets were built from scratch. Because of the subject matter, he received no military assistance from Uncle Sam. The movie was based upon the shocking novel The Short-timers (a brilliant read I might add that was even more darker and brutal than Full Metal Jacket).The movie was filmed in two parts. The first half takes place in basic training. We follow the lives of a bunch of new marine recruits that are broken down and dehumanized into soldiers. Doctors and Sergents weed out the people who'll either snap or breaks down (those that can't cut the mustard). Part two deals with a soldier's life during the Tet Offensive and the Battle for Hue City. Take a look folks because this will probably the last time you'll see a movie about war (made in the U.S.A. and backed by a major film company) to show war as gritty, nasty and vile. With all of the Patriotism/Nationalism going on today, the lines of free speech and censorship are ever so blurred. Stanley Kubrick pulled another one out of his hat by making an anti-war film that shows the brutality of not only warfare but the dehumanization process that recruits go through. Kubrick's gritty film style and hand held camera work was basically copied and stolen by many film makers today (i.e. Steven Spielberg). It's gotten to the point were you can't even enjoy war films anymore because they're all the same (direction, filming and editing wise).Kudos to Kubrick for taking a chance and making such a non-commercial film. Too bad his cinematic input wasn't more prolific.Highly recommended.",10,1,1,30 July 2005
Top Secret!," The comedy team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker.
","Top Secret! (1984) was a funny parody of spy movies and World War II movies. The movie takes place in Eastern Europe. A lot of the humor in this movie is dated but it's still funny. Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an American Pop Star who's caught in a web of intrigue. Can Nick save his neck and the free world? Is this movie really that funny? Watch it and find out for yourself! Peter Cushing makes a cameo appearance speaking 'Swedish' as well as film great Omar Shariff. Another funny film from Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker.The humor is fast and so is the pace of the movie. Val Kilmer does his own singing and he's pretty funny in this movie. I have to recommend it.",8,1,2,7 August 2005
The Thing," Revenge of the 80's meet The Cinema of John Carpenter: The Thing.
","The Thing (1982) was another one of those classic horror films that was being remade during the eighties. But this time hot director John Carpenter was given the green light to re-invent the film. Carpenter decided wisely to remain faithful to the original story line and created a dark and depressing movie about alien mutations and co-habitation within humans. He also create an atmosphere of hopelessness with no light at the end of the tunnel. This film is also the first part of his Apocalyptic Trilogy.A group of scientist and technicians are living inside a U.S. research base in the middle of Antarctica. Nothing but the cold and cabin fever accompanies them. One day they get a taste of excitement when a helicopter from a nearby Norwegian research base is chasing a dog. They fail to kill the dog and die in the process. The guys were left wondering why they wanted to kill that husky so bad. unfortunately they do find out but by then it's too late. A mutating copy cat alien is living within the base. One by one it kills off the crew refusing to show itself. Paranoia and madness soon sets in and no one trusts anyone. By the end of the film, the men destroy their own refuge. The last two survivors sit in the ruins not trusting one another and die in the cold Antarctic wastelands with weapons in hand waiting for the other to show their true self.Another great film from John Carpenter. Too bad he couldn't keep the streak going. His next film was a unwise choice. Due to the lack of box office drawing power, Carpenter was forced to jump on the Stephen King band wagon and adapt one of his works for the silver screen. It was a failure as well, but nowhere as cool as THE THING.Highly recommended.",9,3,7,19 August 2005
American Psycho," Being crazy has never looked so cool.
","American Psycho (2000) was a remarkable film. Not only did Christian Bale do a fantastic job at mimicking Tom Cruise and re-inventing him as an eighties psycho yuppie, but it launched the unmanly metro-sexual fad that has caused many dudes to have lose their man card. The second feature film from Mary Harron (her debut was the fantastic I SHOT ANDY WARHOL). She does a very good job of adapting the controversial novel of the same name.Christian Bale stars as a reserved rich kid who's has a do nothing job in his father's company. He spends his days doodling and hanging with his co-workers. His nights are spent expressing his unusual dark side. Just how whacked and crazy does he get? That would be too telling.

The Shining," The World of Stanley Kubrick: The Shining.
","The Shining (1980) was Stanley Kubrick's attempt to make a bona fide horror film. Despite the fact that he has never really directed one, he was infatuated with the project. He read the novel by Stephen King and set out to recreate the novel, his own way. What we get is a cold ans sterile film that resembles the original source material some what. We get a maniacal and crazed Jack Nicholson, a doormat Shelly Duvall and a minor actor/performer Scatman Crothers a shot a some big time acting. The actors were 'motivated' by the director's work but it just didn't work out as one might felt it should have.Technically, the film was good (despite the many takes the film is filled with a multitude of errors and goofs). A film maker who doesn't understand the genre shouldn't try to implement their ideas when making such a film. The movie itself was a disappointment to die hard Stephen King fans but it gave Jack Nicholson an even greater level of success as an cult actor and made the line 'Here's Johnny' even more popular than it has ever been. A lot of the dialog involving Jack Nicholson was improvised (the documentary shot by Vivian Kubrick shows him working himself up into character!) A nerve racking shoot filled with a lot of tension and nervousness.Overall I would have to say that the film was a brilliant failure. A flop as a horror film but brilliant on every other level. In order for a film like this to work properly you need either a top notch horror film maker or heavy involvement and input from the writer. If you want to see why Jack Nicholson fans rave over this movie then you need to see him in action. This is the film! I would have to recommend this film with caution for non-Kubrick fans and horror fanatics in general.Recommended.",9,1,2,30 July 2005
Duck Soup," Marx Brothers Mania (Chico, Groucho , Zeppo & Harpo)
","Duck Soup (1933) has to be the best Marx Brothers film. Not only do you have all four of the brothers in action, but the humor is sharp, witty and relevant in this day and age. Groucho spits out the one-liners, Harpo and Chico do all of the sight gags and pratfalls whilst Zeppo plays the straight man. I wish all four of them continued to make more movies (Zeppo would soon leave the group). What I like about this film is the musical numbers are few (and when they do occur they're quite funny instead of mere filler).The movie takes place in the country of Freedonia. They're in a border rival with Sylvania. The president of Freedonia (Groucho) is facing a nationwide debut and a sluggish economy. Groucho woos a rich dowager in an effort to solve his country's financial woes. But the representative of Sylvania keeps on blocking his advances towards the dowager. With his pride insulted, Groucho hires two double agents to spy on Sylvania. Can Groucho win the dowager's hands? Will Chico and Harpo be unmasked as double agents? Will the two countries go to war? There's only one way to find out. Watch Duck Soup! You wont regret it!I loved this movie. It has to be my favorite comedy of all time. You can't go wrong with this one. I found it to be highly amusing and a non-stop laugh riot. I have to give this movie my highest recommendation!",10,1,2,6 August 2005
The Battle of Algiers," A phenomenal film about the struggle for independence in Algeria. Similar to current events!
","The Battle of Algeria (1965) was a great film documenting the story of the struggle of freedom fighters who jump started the road to independence for the native people of Algeria. For years, Algerians were denied their own self identity under French colonial rule. The people were impoverished and lacked self confidence. A group of underground rebels wanted to change all that so they waged a guerrilla war against the French occupiers. Although the rebels were eventually crushed and wiped out, the people never forgot their bravery. A few years later, the French eventually left Algeria for good.The movie is not about the success of the freedom fighters. Sure they were crushed but their spirit live on. The oppressed natives rose and drove the French out. Many directors have copied from this film either style wise or certain scenes (check out the eighties flick RED DAWN, the later half of that movie was lifted from BATTLE OF ALGERIA.) The director shot this movie as a docu-drama. You'll feel for the street thug turned freedom fighter. At first glance he seems like a ordinary punk trying to save his own skin. But you get to see his transformation on screen. You'll also feel for the French general, he sympathizes with the enemy because he too was partisan during W.W.II (a theme also found in RED DAWN). The politics of this movie are pretty much left of center. People have criticized this film for glorifying a group a radical extremist Muslims turn there country into a back word country. But you must realize the director is more concerned about the idea of freedom and self identity. Repression is no fun. People should not be colonized by those who perceive themselves to be 'saviors' or enlighten persons of the cloth. There was no reason why France held on to Algeria for so long. First Viet-Nam then Algeria. The empire of Napoleon III was slowly eroding away.If you love films by Costa-Gavras, Oliver Stone or Peter Watkins then you'll want to do yourself a favor and watch this brilliant movie. You wont regret it!",10,1,4,18 August 2005
Rocky IV," Brain dead sequel featuring a near brainless pugilist padded out with musical montages.
","Rocky, on the verge of stupidity (which he achieves in the next film) over comes adversity (yet again) to fight a muscled bounded, steroid fueled monster Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). The big question in this movie is why does Rocky risk his health and the few brain cells he has left to try and challenge a genetic freak like Drago. By this time in the franchise Rocky has more guts than brains (a lot more). If I was Rocky's wife I would've put him in a sanatorium (didn't he see what Drago did to his friend and punchy buddy Apollo Creed?)Recommended for a few laughs if nothing else.B-P.S. Where in the hell did Michael Pataki get that crazy accent? I wonder how many episodes of Rocky and Bullwinkel did he watch before he got that Boris accent down pat?",6,3,6,12 November 2003
Face_Off," The Cinema of John Woo.
","Face Off (1997) would mark the last time John Woo would show flashes of his former self in a mainstream Action film (I don't care what people say, Black Jack was quite interesting). The movie reunites John Travolta and John Woo in another action flick. This time he acts opposite of Nicolas Cage (Coppola) in a tale about dopplegangers, hidden sides and secrets. The action scenes are filmed quite well but they lack something that I can't explain and the stunt work is too obvious. John Woo also digs deep into his past work to re-use a lot of his older action set pieces. But is the film watchable?Two rivals ,one an Fedeal Agent(John Travolta) and the other a Worldwide wanted criminal(Nicolas Cage) have a blood feud that has reached it's limits. When the two finally have it out in a high impact fire fight outside an airport, one is captured whilst the is showered with praises. But it doesn't end just there. What happens next has to be seen to be believed. Not a true classic like his earlier films, but this will be the best it'll ever get for mainstream John Woo. Without an action director to direct the scenes, Woo's films are nothing more than a shell of his former self. Maybe he should spend a few shekels and hire him for future film projects. Until then we'll just have to settle for rehashed action scenes from a director who just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Maybe he should go back to making comedies or learned more form his mentor Chang Cheh.Recommended for fans of John Woo's Hollywood work.",7,3,6,21 February 2005
Cross of Iron," Underrated Anti-War classic from Sam Peckinpah.
","Cross of Iron (1977) was a low budget masterpiece from ace director Sam Peckinpah. After having a falling out from Hollywood, Peckinpah went to Europe to direct this W.W.II. anti-war film. The film centers around Sergent Steiner, a battle weary veteran who leads his company into battle everyday for the past three years. Unlike others his only concern is the survival of his men and the fact that he's a live to live another day. One day an officer of Prussian descent (Maximillian Schnell) decides to make his and everyone beneath him lives miserable. James Mason plays the battle hardened Colonel whilst David Warner co-stars as his cynical aide de camp.Using the limited time and budget to it's fullest extent, Peckinpah created a very stylish and action packed film. The bullets fly, shells pound the earth and the blood flows. The editing is brilliant and the cinematography perfectly captures the action. The battles are very well staged and the acting is executed very well. James Coburn earned his stripes with this film. He's the man! Senta Berger a Peckinpah veteran from Major Dundee) has a small role as a German nurse who briefly becomes involved with Sergent Steiner. What I liked about this movie was the fact that Coburn, Warner and Mason didn't bother to use fake Teutonic accents.If you're a viewer of war films or a Peckinpah fan, this has to be on top of your list. This is one hell of an action film. War will never look the same again after watching this film. Sadly the domestic D.V.D. release is not only expensive but of poor quality. Try and find and alternate way of watching this neglected masterpiece. I have to give this film a very high rating.Highest recommendation possible.",10,123,143,16 October 2004
Aliens," Not as brilliant as the first one but just as entertaining!
","Aliens (1986) was the follow up to the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is in trouble. Not only is the corporation's multi-million dollar spaceship is gone but so is the crew. To add to her worries, she's missed a lot of time during her last trip. With no one willing to listen to her ramblings and a whole lot of explaining to do, Ripley is stuck between a rock and a hard place. That is until the corporation gives her an offer she cannot refuse.All though it's not as well directed or written as Alien (1979), the sequel Aliens is quite entertaining. This time Ripley get's some payback for all the grief those acid dripping insectoids brought down upon her in the past. This time around James Cameron takes over the directorial reins in this typical 80's gung-ho and pseudo-patriotic sci-fi/horror film. Despite all the macho posing and tough guy posturing, this one's worth a couple of replays. Several of the Cameron players appear in this one as well.Recommended.B+",Null,0,0,21 June 2004
The Exorcist," Classic Horror Films Series.
","The Exorcist (1973) was one of the greatest horror films ever made. It scared the nation and the people wanted more! The movie made a lot of money and it launched William Friedkin's career beyond the stratosphere (he was already a big name thanks to the French Connection). William Peter Blatty's novel was already a big seller when it was optioned for a silver screen adaptation. The conflicts between the two over how it would be presented as a film could make a movie by it's own right. There was as much action behind the scenes as there was in front of the camera.The story is about a priest who's at an ancient Sumerian archaeological excavation site. Father Merrin has been following the presence of an ancient evil deity named Pazul. He confronted it some time ago and is still haunted by it. At the same time, a young adolescent Georgetown resident is communicating with someone named Captain Howdy. Is their a connection? Meanwhile a middle aged priest is having disturbing dreams and doubts about his chosen profession of living a life of poverty as a priest. Are all these stories in some way connected? One must find out when watching The Exorcist!I am a fan of this classic. The behind the scenes tensions made this movie. The cast was excellent and William Friedkin was on the ball (Unlike most of his films after this one). The creepy 'Tubular Bells' was an appropriate choice for the film's soundtrack. The Exorcist revived the career of Max Von Sydow and made a star out of Linda Blair. Watch it and you'll find out why it scared so many and stirred up a lot of emotions from the religious right and the moral majority. A true classic!Highly recommended!Like all successful films that came out of Hollywood, the Italians and a lot of lower tier American studios couldn't resist and cloned this movie to death. Some are good and others are pretty atrocious. The Italian film industry was saved by making knockoffs and parodies of this movie. I guess the so called 'spaghetti westerns' were dead.",10,6,11,26 October 2004
Saw III," The third installment of the Saw series
","Saw III (2006) is the third part of the ever popular Saw series. Jigsaw is gravely ill, but he is determined to finish the game that he has started. Now with an apprentice, Jigsaw has a new player and we learn more about his past and hints to what motivates him to continue in his quest to show how valuable life is.... or does he? Saw III is a step down from the first two films and a lot more twisted. More screen time is focused on bloody and at times a bit sadistic set pieces But if you love the series, then you'll have to really pay attention to some of the hidden clues that'll be further expanded upon in the next film. Even though it's not as strong as the first two films, I would not miss this one.Highly recommended.",8,0,0,6 September 2008
Die Hard 2," Revenge of the 80's: The Sequel.
",Die Hard 2 (1990) was a terrible and meaningless sequel. The situations were inane and filled with nonsensical logic and it was stupid all around. I don't know why they even bothered to make this movie. Everything about is just plain rubbish. All of the elements that made the first film interesting were either over done or never utilized. The bad guys wern't cool and the performances seemed forced. They should have left well enough alone. But I guess the lure of filthy lucre and endless sequels won out over logic and sanity.The movie takes place at an airport during the holidays. This time John's (Bruce Willis) wife (Bonnie Bedelia McCulkin) is flying to the east coast. But the threat of terrorists and violence towards the innocence put another hold on their holiday plans. Can John save the day once again? Will there be another lame plot twist? How will show up from the previous movie? To find out you'll have to watch DIE HARD 2: The Sequel!!!!A rubbish sequel.

Resident Evil," Disappointed, highly disappointed.
","Resident Evil (2002) is a movie that's loosely based on the zombie killing video game series. If you're going to make a movie based upon a video game at least play it before you decide to write and direct a movie based on it. I've seen several Japanese zombie flicks that are not based on the game that are more truer to the original source than this movie. Leave it up to Paul W. Anderson to take a brilliant concept and ruin it by making a movie that is so unlike the game. By itself it's a decent movie. You can take Resident Evil out of the title and it wouldn't make a difference. This movie wasn't that very good to be labeled Resident Evil. The brain dead suits at Capcom made a huge mistake when they let George A. Romero go and hired someone who's never made a zombie flick. Oh well, that's their problem.Back to the movie. How can you make a zombie movie with sparse views of head shots? I don't know but the makers of this movie manage to. The only thing worth while about this film are the first appearance of the zombies, the music and Milla Jovovich. Other than that it's a complete waste of time. Go out and watch Junk, Stacy or Wild Zero. At least you'll have some fun.For Zombie completest only.",4,0,1,22 April 2004
The Pianist," The Cinema of Roman Polanski; A survivor's tale.
","The Pianist (2002) was Roman Polanski's most personal film to date and an acting tour de force for Adrian Brody. The movie takes place during World War II. A brilliant pianist is forced to live like an animal during the war. Since he's of Jewish heritage, his family and others that have been 'branded' with the star of David are forced to life in concentration camps and ghettos. But this film is not about this topic, that has been beaten to death already. The PIanist is about surviving and keeping one's head together just so they could live another day. Adrian Brody was quite impressive as the Pianist. He conveyed emotion and acting on a level that I never thought he could have ever attained. Roman Polanski's direction was razor sharp and he creates an environment that felt so authentic and real.In many ways the Pianist also reflects upon the life of Roman Polanski. He has been in the same situations before and has experienced life in the ghettos and camps. Just like the title character, Roman Polanski is a survivor and he can still make films with the best of them.Highest recommendation possible.",10,2,5,30 July 2005
The Transporter," Jason Statham action star.
","The Transporter (2002) was a fun action film that was directed by Jet Li's fight director Corey Yuen and it starred Jason Statham. Jason stars as Frank Martin. He's a hired gin who does driving jobs for a hefty fee. For his services he'll use his superb driving skills to get his paying customers out of a jam. He asks no questions and needs precise instruction in order to perfectly time his getaways. His number one rule is to never ask questions. One day he takes a gig from a sleazy and shady man named Betancourt (Matt Schulze). Instead of delivering the goods, he breaks his number one rule and peeks inside the package...A fun action film filled with bone breaking action and wild stunts. People have unfairly slammed this movie for being unrealistic. What do you expect? The action scenes are performed to flamboyant ans stylized you have to suspend belief. It's one of those movies that doesn't throw in realism all of a sudden to make the movie more interesting. Jason Statham is pretty cool as well as the Transporter and he seems legit, not another tough guy phony. HE looks like he can knock the tar out of you in a real fight. Co-stars Shu Qi (she learned to speak English phonetically for her role in this movie).Highly recommended.",8,58,77,27 August 2005
The Mist," Stephen King's film adaptations: The Mist
","The Mist (2007) is a very entertaining film from Frank Darabont. I was surprised by how well this film was. Because Frank Darabont directed it, I thought it would be another weepy flick like The Green Mile or The Shawshank Redemption. Boy was I wrong. I would rank this at the top of Stephen King's movie adaptations. It not only stayed very true to the original source material, but it improved on several things (Mrs. Carmody was hot instead of a being an old crone being one). The story is one of survival horror, a strange mist comes into town bringing with it something wicked and terrifying.I wished the theatrical release was shot in black and white (When Stephen King wrote The Mist he always pictured it being shot in Cinemascope and in black and white). Darabont also felt the same way but shot the film in color for commercial reasons (but the two disc DVD has a black in white version!) A very awesome flick that's a scary, creepy and a whole lot of fun.Highly recommended",8,1,2,4 March 2009
Back to the Future Part III," The third and final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy
","Back to the Future Part III (1990) is the final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy which began in 1985. Due to the same freak lighting storm that sent Marty McFly (Michael J.

With the fate of the space/time continuum and the lives of Marty and Doc weigh in the balance of the events that will transpire in the wild west version of the city of Hill Valley and their ancestors. Can Marty McFly and Doc Brown put everything back in balance or will the universe collapse from within itself?The final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy is a fun watch but a big drop off from part II. They were both shot back-to-back utilizing most of the cast from the previous films. The writing and direction of Robert Zemeckis along with the acting of Michael J. Fox hold this film together. Christopher Lloyd held his own as the eccentric Doc Brown along with the lovable and talented Mary Steenburgen as the new schoolmarm Clara Clayton.Fans of the series will appreciate the ending of the film and storyline.",7,1,1,13 July 2015
Rules of Engagement," The Decline and Fall of Hurricane Billy: Rules of Engagement.
","Rules of Engagement (2000) was a blah movie. I can not believe this movie was directed by the same man who made The Exorcist and The Sorcerer. A lot of film makers fall out of grace. Then there are those who try to receive penance by making pay check films (for either television or major studios). But William Friedkin has done but and they're so lame and tame that this once innovative film maker has been reduced to produced overproduced schlock.The movie is about a soldier who must confront his past to deal with the present (how many times has this been done to death?). Throw in some gratuitous violence, soap opera court room theatrics and a lot of xenophobic attitudes and you have this movie. I wont bore you with details and spoil the movie for you.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," I was impressed, sort of.
","Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) was a lot better than I expected. I was disappointed by the first film. It was kind of cool because it's been awhile since I seen a zombie movie on the big screen but the end results were mediocre at best. The sequel was far more entertaining and more like a video game movie. The only thing that would keep this movie from getting a higher rating is the fact that there is very little blood or gore. Besides a couple of scenes there really isn't much. The actionset pieces were pretty good whilst the pacing is just right for a movie of this type.Taking place right after the events that have transpired in the first film, Racoon City has been overruned with zombies! The Umbrella corporation (doing what all big companies would do) remove all key important members of their company from the city and seal off the exits in hope of trying to contain their little accident. The city is sealed off from the rest of the world. It's residents are cut off and are basically left to fend for themselves whilstthe virus runs it's course. But a few people inside don't want to become a zombie's midnight snack. So it's up to Claire and Alice plus a few other survivors to try and survive. But a wrench is thrown into their plans. Umbrella wants to try out their latest and most expensive project to date. Fans of the video game series know whom I'm talking about!A fun film that'll entertain genre fans. Just don't expect a lot from a movie like this. You have to rate films like this differently than other genres (such as Dramas and Epics). This is the kind of movie you'll just have to leave your thinking caps at the door.Recommended.B",Null,5,11,14 October 2004

A group of collegekids go fooling around in some old cabin and discover the Necronomicon. Yes, they find the book that H.P. Lovecraft used to love to write about. A book made from human skin and contains a bizarre language and horrific images.  Evil Dead was the movie that raised the bar on shock and gore.Not only did this movie launch the career of Sam Raimi but it made BruceCampbell a B-movie legend.   Made on the cheap but it brought in a lot ofmoney and in the process became one of the most talked about horror filmsof all time.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Part one of a three plus hour film.
","Kill Bill: Volume One (2003) was the first part of a three and a half hour film. Instead of putting out a three and a half hour grind house picture, the directed split it in half and got two movies out of the production. Quentin Tarentino knew better than to try and direct the action scenes himself so he hired Yuen Woo-Ping to direct the action. When you combine The Bride Wore Black, From Bombay to Nagoya and Lady Snow Blood you get one of the most interesting films of 2003.The movie is about a woman simply known as the Bride (Uma Thurman). She was a member of an elite team of assassins known as the DiVAS (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox). All of it's members had code names of poisonous snakes. Well, she wanted to leave but it ain't so easy to leave the business.

The road to revenge is filled with a lot of obstacles. Can The Bride achieve her goals and eliminate the DiVAs or will they be able to stop her dead in her tracks?I didn't like the American release but I saw the movie again on a Japanese import D.V.D. and I was quite impressed by the uncut version.

The Last Emperor," A western look at the fall of the Manchurian Dynasty and the life of a true survivor.
","The Last Emperor (1987) was a western look at the fall of the Manchurian Dynasty, the last piece if ancient China. The Manchu's emperor would later become a prisoner of his own environment. In the latter years of his life, he would remain ignorant of the warlord period and his corruption of 'power' when he would become a glorified puppet of the Japanese Empire. After the end of World War II, the Emperor Pu Yi would later become a prisoner of war in a Chinese 're-education' center. He would have to answer for his crimes and be reformed so he could live in a new society.Pu Yi is the ultimate survivor and has managed to escape with his life on several times. He has watched those around him die and sacrifice themselves just so he could live another day. Eventually, Pu Yi learns to live with others and renounce his privilege life and become a comrade of brothers within Mao's China. One thing that I didn't like about this movie (besides playing around with the facts) was most of the actors spoke in thick accents and broken English. To make it as realistic as possible they should have used sub-titles and have the actors speak in their native tongues. A film of extraordinary magnitude. I would also like to recommend the Hong Kong production of Yoshiro Kawashima. She was the last crowned Princess of Manchuria who's life evolved around the activities of Pu Yi. But she wasn't as lucky as Emperor Pu Yi (or was she?).Highly recommended (despite it's flaws).",8,1,1,20 August 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Stanley Kubrick's vision of the future!
","2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a breath taking look at a possible future through the eyes of Arthur C. Clarke and under the direction of Stanley Kubrick. The movie itself is more of a visual work of art than anything else. All of Kubrick's future (no pun intended) trademarks can be found in this film (cold sterile sets and the Kubrick 'stare' to name a few). The two made an awesome team. A shame that they never worked with each other again. Imagine the possibilities.The movie follows the stages of man's evolution under the watchful of the ominous monolith. Who or what exactly the monolith is or what it represents is up to the viewer to decide. I have an opinion but I'll keep it to myself. Beginning with the dawn of man and civilization, the evolved simian and to the year 2001. Man has reached the stars but will they enjoy what they discover? From Earth to the Moon to Jupiter, man has traveled hither and yonder. But they still don't grasp the basic understanding of life in general and it's continued evolution Does the discovery of the monolith on the moon have anything to do with it? Will Dr. Heywood Floyd and his men learn the meaning of it? What about Dave Bowman and his crew that orbit Jupiter? You'll have to find out when you watch this classic science fiction flick.I enjoyed this movie ever since I was a child. I have never seen anything like this before. The visuals and the music are extremely haunting. Kubrick has made a masterpiece (only to be topped by his brilliant film Barry Lyndon). A cinematic enigma that's has so many possibilities.Followed a few years later with a direct sequel. Not as brilliant as this one but satisfactory for die hard fans of the novels.Highly recommended.",10,4,9,5 February 2005

The film had those but they were used very well. The direction and acting were all up to par. The film starts off with two guys in a barren wash room, decay is present everywhere. The two fellows have no idea why they're chained to some corroded pipes. During this time, a crazed killer is on the loose preying upon a select group of individuals. Their tormentor communicates to the two through a hidden speaker and telephone. What unspeakable horror awaits them?I don't want to tell you any more. The best thing about this film is the surprises that awaits the viewers. To give it would ruin this movie. All I can say is that I highly recommend this film.

The movie updates the 1950's classic giving it an 80's feel and utilizing some of the most vile effects to date. The Fly remake is more of a product of it's time than a true remake. Only a few of the elements from the original film can be found in this one. Cronenberg also takes advantage of the high-tech gore effects and a 'liberal' R-rating in this film.Jeff Goldblum stars as the scientist Seth Brundle (this is the buff Goldblum, he doesn't look too much like the walking stickthat he was during the late 70's). He invents a device that can transport matter from one place to another. Geena Davis (looking good) co-stars as Seth's love interest. Whilst the transporter can be a miracle of science, it has some negative effects on genetic tissue. Can the two lovers make it through this picture? One has to find out for themselves.Cronenebreg reinvents the original film with some creepy results. This depressing film is a must for Cronenberg fans and horror film buffs. The effects are a sight to behold and the direction and acting are on par. I saw this movie when I was in Junior High School and it blew my mind. I have to recommend this movie.A",9,0,1,13 October 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," The World of Stanley Kubrick: Eyes Wide Shut.
","Eyes Wide Shut (1999) was Stanley Kubrick's final film. This movie probably killed him in the end. He never even got the chance to present a final cut of this film. The production on this film was very lengthy. Reshoots and hundreds of takes were never enough for the man, he wanted perfection (that's what happens when a photographer becomes a film maker). The movie was a very non-commercial one and a lot of post production tinkering was made to get this movie some mainstream acceptance. Kidman and Cruise are brilliant in this film. Fellow director Sidney Pollack shows that he can act as well as direct. Too bad the film was tinkered with in the editing room (get the Hong Kong V.C.D.). Not the movie that I wanted to see Kubrick make before he died (what ever happened to the Aryan Papers and the Napoleon project?)but I guess it'll have to do (like I have a choice). In a way it is fitting for him, making a mainstream movie after all of these years.Recommended for Kubrick fans only.",8,0,2,30 July 2005
Zombieland," A teen comedy disguised as a 'zombie' movie that has more bore and snore than gore.
","Zombieland is a mediocre movie filled with flat humor and dialog that sounds as if it was written by an 8th grader. The only thing that saves this movie from being a straight out stinker is Woody Harrelson but other than that it's just a dud. I didn't care for the protagonist, the so called 'zombies', the silly 'rules' or the two female characters. They're so annoying that I was wishing that the infected would kill them. The filmmakers tried too hard to be funny and when that happens it always end up pear shaped. I was expecting something entertaining, maybe in the vein of Brain-Dead or Shaun of the Dead. Perhaps I was asking too much. I have seen DTV movies that work a lot better than this. I just wasn't buying into anything the director was selling. The movie didn't work as either a horror film or a comedy.The dialog was bad. I mean an adolescent must have wrote it. I didn't care for the pop culture references and the 'hipness' of it. The overuse of movie titles, rehashing dumb clichés and the forcefulness of the situations was too clunky for me. The movie was obviously aimed for the late teen crowd because they're the only ones who will buy into this mediocre film and will think it's 'cool'. Real fans of zombie movies will not be amused by it. What I really can't stand are the 'zombies'. These are not the classic kind but the ones from Demons or 28 Days Later. They can run (I guess being infected gives you superhuman endurance and speed) and leap obstacles in a single bound.The direction was flat. I didn't like the way the scenes flowed or the way the action moved along. One minutes it's like a music video and the next it plods around slooowly.... The big action set pieces seem like a pastiche of action movies. I know logic has no place in a horror movie but Wichita gets off like two dozen rounds out of her shotgun but doesn't reload once and when she's in a real pinch, she's OUT of shells. Another scene that sticks out is when Tallahassee is shooting through the grate that surrounds that carny stand. There is no way he can shoot out through it without killing or severely maiming himself.Last but not least is the big 'cameo'. It's no surprise if you have seen the credit list. Bill Murray playing himself hiding out in his 'mansion' out in Beverly Hills. Bill hasn't had a hit in years and I doubt he's still living the life (maybe the 'high' life) like the way he did during his heyday in the 80's. He appears 'wearing' zombie makeup and blending in with the rest of the dead. But truth be told if you read the celebrity blogs, he looks like that after hanging out at one frat party too many (that's another story). He really does play himself, hung over and shuffling around in a daze.Overall, I wouldn't pay to watch this movie. Maybe when it hits CineMax in a few months or when you can rent it for a dollar at RedBox. If you love Shaun of the Dead (Yes I am comparing it to this movie because that's how the studio is marketing it) then you will not care for this one. But if you love the teen comedy crap that Hollywood seems to be churning out then you'll definitely want to see it. Light on gore but heavy on bore and snore.",2,25,55,2 October 2009
Die Hard," The first and best film of the series.
","Die Hard (1988) was an good and entertaining film that made a star out of Bruce Willis and gave Alan Rickman's career a shot in the arm as a screen villain. Despite many flaws and any lack of credibility, it's still a fun and watchable movie. The real star of this film is Alan Rickman. He makes a creepy and entertaining villain who acts circles around the cast. A visiting New York cop (Bruce Willis) is inside a high rise building trying to see his ex-wife (Bonnie Bedelia Mc Culken). His timing is bad because he walks right into an armed heist. The leader of the thugs (Alan Rickman) claims to be an international terrorist who wont stop at nothing to free his brother in arms. What is a cop on holiday going to do? Can he rescue the innocent people and save his wife? How will this affect his Christmas plans? Is the leader of this armed gang really what he claims to be? you'll have to find out when you watch DIE HARD.Like I said, it's not the classic people make it out to be. It's an entertaining popcorn movie. The film makers rushed out and made a sequel that makes this one look realistic.Recommended.",7,2,5,15 August 2005
Psycho," Alfred Hitchcock Classics: Psycho.
","Psycho (1960) is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. The movie is loosely based upon the novel by Robert Bloch and it was adapted by Joseph Stefano. Psycho made stars out of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (sadly it also sent the two to typecasting hell in the process). Hitchcock proved that he could adapt to the changing styles of Hollywood and make a true horror classic. He wisely shot the movie in black and white (giving the film an even creepier aura)and used a lot of great camera angles and trick photography. Anthony Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, a young man who's life has been ruined by his overbearing mother. Janet Leigh is perfect as the young woman with the shady past trying to find a new life.Psycho was not only the pinnacle in Alfred Hitchcock's film career as a director but it also changed the face of horror. Just when film makers such as himself where being phased out by Hollywood, Mr. Hitchcock redefined not only as a director but in the process changed the face of horror forever.The success of this movie spawned three direct sequels, a pilot for a t.v. series (Bates Motel) and a badly made remake (Although I have to say the cinematography was beautiful). It has also been parodied to death and referenced in many horror films and comedies. Psycho has not only achieved worldwide fame but it's also a part of Americana as well. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it already. Truly a one of a kind film.Highest recommendation possible.",9,0,1,9 October 2004
Rosemary's Baby," The Cinema of Roman Polanski
","Rosemary's Baby (1968) was a film that's based upon a best selling novel written by Ira Levin. Unlike most novels that were made into movies, this film follows the book very closely. They're very similar except Roman Polaski adds an aura of paranoia and isolation to the film. Mia Farrow stars as a young bride who's dealing with her marriage and her husband (an aspiring actor played by John Cassavetes) who's looking for the right apartment for the young couple. They find the right place in an old complex that caters to older couples. John falls in love with the odd elderly neighbors and becomes friends whilst Mia is a little leery at first but becomes friends with them as well. But when a series of strange occurrences that seem to benefit John and the weird homemade brew the neighbor women bring Mia to drink when they learn about her pregnancy gives her second thoughts about the new apartment and their ever so friendly elderly neighbors.When Mia begins to hear strange sounds and waking up during a very bad dream drives her to the brink of madness. The isolation she feels because of the age differences of her neighbors, the pregnancy and John's new attitude towards religion and life in general pushes her further and further. Soon she learns about the awful truth about the tenants in her building from an old friend (who's illness and death drives Mia batty). She tries to leave the circle of her husband and neighbors but she realizes no matter where she goes they always manage to find her. By the end of the film she's too far gone and can do nothing more but accept her fate and learn to live with it. Classic horror. Paranoia and the occult has never been captured like this before. Roman Polanski redefined the genre with this movie and it's success has catapult him even further up the Hollywood charts. That is until personal tragedy brings him back down to reality.Highly recommended.",9,0,2,10 February 2005
The Cannonball Run," Golden Harvest bankrolled this picture? Part one.
","Cannonball Run (1981) was one of those road race movie genres that was reborn during the mid 70's. The first of them was released by New World Pictures and it was the entertaining Cannonball, starring David Carradine and the Roger Corman players.  A few years later Hollywood and Golden Harvest teamed together to make a washed up Hollwood stars road film about the mythical cross country race called The Cannonball Run. Yes, this film has more wash-ups and has been than you can shake a stick at.  It looks like a who's who of former and future stars of Hollywood Squares. Golden Harvest produced half the film and they used their stroke to put in the company's two biggest stars Jackie Chan and Michael Hui.  The problem is they play Japanese race car drivers. Japanese race car drivers who speak cantonese?!
But the ring leader of this motley crew is old Burt Reynolds.  Yes, him and Hal Needham made this film to please his Smokey and the Bandit crowd.  Needham should stick with directing stunt scenes and leave film-making to the professionals.Not as bad as the later films in this series but not quite that entertaining.  Stick with Cannonball for some funstuff. If you must watch every single out of work or fading star in Hollywood ham up the screen then this one's your cup oftea, others beware!Average.C-",Null,2,4,20 June 2004
Halloween," Carpenter's giallo picture and the beginning of a franchise.
","Halloween (1978) was John Carpenter's homage to Dario Argento andMario Bava.  A horror/thriller uses mood, music and lighting instead ofrelying on buckets of red paint and cheap scares.  This movie also was thestart of a movie franchise and has spawned hundreds of knock-offs andrip-offs.  Halloween is also responsible for the 'teenage girl' in peril films. It's also responsible for the called 'slasher' films that become the staple of 80's horror flicks and a tired cliche in latter day movies.The film spans a twenty year period.  A young boy has whacked his sisterand is placed in the funny farm.  His shrink (Donald Pleasence) is afraid ofthe boy and it seems he didn't do a very good job of treating him for hispsychosis. Now he doesn't want him to ever see the light of day, and forgood reason.  The man is a bonafide monster.

Paths of Glory," The World of Stanley Kubrick: The Paths of Glory.
","Pathes of Glory (1957) has to be one of the greatest anti-war films ever made. The cast is excellent, everyone from Kirk Douglas to Timothy Carey Jr. (who steals the show). Stanley Kubrick solidifies his film career with this film. Their would be no turning back for this young and head strong film maker.During World War I, the French are losing ground to the Germans. The pompous French generals only care about glory and the pride of victory. But they are oblivious to the new age of warfare. After taking another serious defeat, they decide to do something about it. They want to make an example of their soldiers by doing something so cruel and drastic. Can humans be so cruel to each other? What are these trumped up charges? Is Stanely Kubrick really a master director? To find out the answers to these questions you'll have to watch Paths of Glory.I highly recommend this film. Over the years, Kubrick's style of film making will only improve. His highest achievement has still yet to materialize!",9,0,0,30 July 2005
Back to the Future Part II," Revenge of the 80's: The Franchise
","Back to the Future Part II (1989) was green lighted after the success of the first film. The film follows the further adventures of Marty and Doc Brown. This film and the third installment were filmed back to back. However the complexity of the storyline turned off many of the fans of the original. But this is what I enjoyed about this movie. Instead of being the same old run-of-the-mill by the numbers sequel, the film makers decided to do something different and make this a brain twister film. The beauty of this movie is that you have to pay close attention to it.The film takes place right after the events of part one. Doc Brown comes back from the future to help Marty get his kid out of trouble. Instead of leaving well enough alone, all three of them head off to the future to try and change events. They managed to pull it off but unfortunately they tore a fabric in time due to Marty being greedy and the nosy efforts of Doc Brown. Can Doc and Marty safely restore the space and time continuum before the universe collapses upon itself?A fun sequel with a few cast changes (Elizabeth Shue now portrays Marty's girlfriend whilst Crispin Glover is no longer with in the film except in stock footage). Most of the original players return to reprise their original roles. Michael J. Fox stretches his acting abilities by playing his son and daughter as well as his older self. If you enjoyed the first film then you'll really want to watch this one (if you haven't already).Highly recommended.",9,47,60,5 February 2005
Carrie," From the works of Stephen King. A film by Brian De Palma.
","Carrie (1976) was Stephen King's first published novel (under his own name) and it would be the first in a long line of book-to-film adaptations. As long as Mr. King continues to right, someone will always try to adapt his novels or stories for either the silver or small screen. This film not only made King's career but it launched a plethora of knock-offs. While Brian De Palma can re-live the glory of making this over-hyped adaptation, it made stars out of 'teen' actors Sissy Spacek, John Travolta, Nancy Allen, William Katt, Amy Irving and P.J. Soles.The is the ultimate revenge movie. A wall flower and social outcast (Sissy Spacek) discovers that she has supernatural powers. These powers have been gestating within her ever since her birth. But slowly over time, her rage has slowly been building within her, waiting for the right time to explode on those who have wronged and crossed her. When will that time be? Who will pay the price for years of making her a pariah to the community at large?Another over-hyped Stephen King adaptation (see also Stand By Me). Read the book instead, but if you don't think reading is 'hip' then this movie will be suffice.",5,0,4,7 August 2005
The Producers," Mel Brooks' directorial debut!
","The Producers (1968) was the first film that Mel Brooks directed. It was a critical smash as well. Gene Wilder stars as a accountant to a Broadway producer (Zero Mostel). Whilst going over his books, he noticed that his productions that bombed actually made money instead of the successful ones. Mostel has an idea, what if he makes a Broadway play that is such a disaster that it only receives one run. He needs two things in order for this plan to go into effect. One, he has to sway Wilder to his side and two, he needs to have a huge amount of investors.Whilst Wilder fixes the numbers, Mostel goes out to all of his elderly female clients whom he swoons with his charm as they write out checks for him to invest in his play. He over sells shares into the play, so when it bombs he doesn't have to pay them back and pockets the money. Now only one question remains, what kind of production will they do that'll be so awful that it'll play once and never again? How will these 'Producers' be able to pull off this ingenious scheme? To find out you'll just have to watch THE PRODUCERS!!! Co-stars Kenneth Mars and Dick Shawn as Lionel Saint Du Bois (L.S.D.).Highly recommended.",9,4,5,27 August 2005

Years later, he's back from the dead terrorizing the children of the parents who murdered him.  He's become a real life monster invading the dreams of his victims.

Can she stop this supernatural fiend before it's too late?Like I said before.  This seminal film is the best in the series.  Wes Craven struck pay dirt with this surprise hit of 1984. Not only did this film kick start the most successful horror film franchise in movie history but it sent it's production company New Line Cinema into the stratosphere making it a big player in Hollywood.  This was the film that made Freddy Krueger a permanent fixture in American pop culture and it become a worldwide phenomenon.Highly recommended.",8,2,2,17 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Cool when I was a kid but lame as an adult.
","Star Wars (1977) was one of those films that I totally marked out for when I was a child. But viewing it today it's just not the same. Have I grown up? Am I not a sci-fi geek like all the other fanatics? Ahh, one of the mysterious of life. I was a huge Darth Vader fan, he was so cool. I mean he'd choke people from across the room and punked out everyone he met (except Peter Cushing). I never liked the good guys such as Luke (whinny young punk) Han Solo (loud mouth wind bag) Princess Leia (ugly with danishes on the side of her head) C-3P0 and R-2 D-2 ( ultimate lavender duo). The Empire was cool and they had better looking uniforms and weaponry. The toys and the models were great (i always like the Empire's Star Cruisers.Today it's just a another sci-fi movie. That rotund money bag keeps on tinkering with his films. The more he fools around with his films the less I care.

Sin City," Awesome Comic Book adaptation!
","Sin City (2005) was a complete surprise for me. When I went to go see this movie I thought it would be okay. I was in for a shock! The film-noir style and the sporadic uses of the primary colors was true eye candy. If video and computers are to be used in film making then this is what they're for! Film makers Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller should be given the glad hand for successfully bringing their visions to the silver screen. But the real star of the show is Mickey Rouke, his performance was so powerful that he almost wins back his cool points that he won (and lost) during the 80's.The all star cast really put in some effort into this production. No disappointments here (except the middle story dragged in places). I can't wait until the next film hits the theaters!Highly recommended!",10,1,4,30 April 2005
Windtalkers," Sergent Enders and the Silver Star.
","Windtalkers (2002) was an expensive egg that John Woo laid at the box office. When it finally hatched, it was rotten. A lot of money was poured into this lame movie. Like I have said in the past, John Woo is a product of his environment. When he was in Hong Kong, he was put on a financial leash. Since he didn't have an obscene budget and a strict ratings system, he had to work with what he had. Now that he's in the U.S. and had a couple of box office success, he was given carte blanche. Now that he produced a couple of money pits, Hollywood is having second thoughts.This poor excuse of an 'epic' is a very bad film. Despite the aforementioned title, this movie has very little to do with the wind talkers. The film pays the subject lip service whilst it mainly focuses on Sgt. Enders (Nicholas Cage). Full of clichés and bad acting, the movie never gets past go. People expecting a flick like Cross of Iron need to look elsewhere. This film tries to be like it but fails miserably.Cross of Iron is a masterpiece about the horrors of war. This film is just another bad Hollywood movie trying to be something that it's not. If you're going to pour almost two hundred million dollars into a film you better deliver an awesome picture. But since this is a mainstream film, you'll know what the end results are. I have to give this movie a very poor rating. I advise you to watch Cross of Iron. That film is a ballet of bullets, slow motion editing and blood soaked montages. Comparing the two is like eating a nice tender steak or a frozen Salisbury steak t.v. dinner.Not recommended.",2,1,3,16 October 2004
Gladiator," A Ridley Scott Film.
","Gladiator (2000) is an overrated nightmare. Whoever wrote this did not research their history very well. The acting was mediocre and it was filled with numerous flaws and wholesale gaps of logic. I hate when film makers do this. Why not make it a farce. People would have accepted it as such if they did. If you're going to do a report or a research paper on the Roman Empire, you will fail if you copy from this movie. But, I was impressed with the games in the Roman Colosseum.Russell Crowe stars as Maximus, a roman centurion who's cushy life one day is changed forever. He discovers that he has to live a new life and tries to adjust to it the best way possible Joaquin Phoenix co-stars as Commodus along with Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou and the late greats Richard Harris and Oliver Reed.

Back to the Future," Revenge of the 80's: Michael J. Fox Superstar
","Back to the Future (1985) was the film that launched Michael J. Fox's career into the stratosphere. This film not only made him into an eighties superstar but it also made Back to the Future a part of Americana and a slight fixture upon Hollywood for a few years there after. This film was so successful that it was made into a trilogy.The film follows a high school student Marty Mc Fly (Michael J. Fox) who's not pleased with the way his life has been going. He always feels that there's more to his life than what there appears to be. When he's not spending time with his girlfriend or his band, Marty is best friends with an eccentric inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc Brown is on the verge of breaking through his latest discovery. Marty watches his family and notice's how broken down they are. But when he see's that the family car is wrecked he loses it. There goes his date! This dilemma isn't nothing compared to what Doc Brown has in store for him!This film is the perfect example of an eighties film. The fashion and style is in your face. Crispin Glover (who plays the Marty father) steals the show with his neurotic style of acting. He portrays Marty with an underlining manic presence. Michael J. Fox makes a somewhat believable teenager and Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc Brown (another character who's a borderline basket case), Eighties stars Lea Thompson, Casey Simezsko, Courtney Gaines and future star Billy Zane appear in this one as well.I happen to enjoy this film. The sequel was entertaining as well. But the final chapter was a weak effort by all. If you like Michael J.
