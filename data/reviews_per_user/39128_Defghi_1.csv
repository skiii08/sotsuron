Vertigo," Best Hitchcock ever
","This movie kept me guessing all the way until the fantastic ending. Its so good, truly a masterpiece. The music is hauntingly beautiful, the acting is great, fantastic photography, everything masterful directed. To say something about the plot would spoil it. If you havnt seen it, see it now!",10,2,4,22 September 2001
