Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," why is everyone saying this was a bad movie!?
","This movie was a very good movie.  You may complain of recycled scenes, unoriginality, or that it is much more complex than the originals.  The truth of the matter is that although this movie may not be much like the original trilogy, It is still an excellent movie.  There are magnificent special effects, wonderful drawn out scenes, Beautiful settings, and creative characters.  When people talk about how this might be the worst movie of all time I think...wow they must not have seen very many movies. What is the point of a movie?  To entertain right?  Well just because it wasnt particularly on par with the others doesn't mean it isn't entertaining.  I found it to be a great movie.  For those people who dare to go on and say that this was the worst movie ever, I would hate to see what you had to say about movies such as Jurassic Park, The Rock, etc.  In my opinion people need to give this movie a break.  It was over-hyped (much like pearl Harbor) and It was not enough to fill the hype, however It certainly served its purpose. That is why I give the movie an 8/10",Null,1,2,13 November 2001
