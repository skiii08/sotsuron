Skyfall," The best 007 movie to date
","I have seen every Bond movie made through Craig. Connery was my favorite Bond, and Moore was my least favorite. Was a very big fan of Dalton in the role and Brosnan did a fine job. Craig is now hands down for me the best Bond casted and Skyfall is the best movie. With the sad exception of character deaths this was a moving, churning, story with an outstanding cast. Dench is a wonderful M, stoic stalwart and duty duty duty. I like the new take on Q. The plot was good throughout and Bardem was a fine villain portraying a character different than he is usually associated with. Craig's Bond is a believable bad ass, if his hair was longer it would get mussed, he seems destined to work without a multitude of gadgets which I particularly enjoy. Page Eight proved that a spy flick can be very human. If you have never watched a Bond movie this is a great stand alone that will get you rolling in the current incarnation of a character that has been iconic one hell of a long time. More than worth the time to watch.",9,1,8,26 November 2013
Star Trek," Saw the original Star Trek first run and I LOVE this movie
","This movie is an example of people taking the time to perfectly cast well known and well-loved characters. This new James Kirk, while not doing the fit and start speaking of old, has Shatners walk onto the bridge like I own and command the universe perfectly. The young man playing Spock is almost scary he is so so good. I am particularly fond of Karl Urban's Bones portrayal. He has the speaking cadence and the sense of Deforest Kelly's original pat with the benefit of today's sensibilities to allow us to see what we knew was in the 60's version. I won't keep going thru the cast but I am pleased with them all. I like some of the tact's that have been taken this time around. The origin of Bones name rather than as a Doctor name which would be typical but from his personal history. I like the way Kirk and Spock end up in star fleet. Look it is a great watch. No it isn't a faithful rerun of the original; hell William Shatner didn't even remain perfectly faithful to it either in his movies. Give it a go with an open mind to a NEW movie.",10,0,1,21 March 2013
The Holiday," How did anyone notice goofs?
","I watched this movie about three times now. I have seen the list of goofs, read some reviews and what I wonder at this point is does anyone just watch a movie? Pay attention to the characters? Eli Wallach still has an amazingly expressive face and uses it to great effect. At his dinner with Kate Winslet he gives a look to her reason for coming to LA that left no doubt he knew she was full of dung. The guy is still amazing after 60 years. The cast was perfectly picked (I read it was written with these folks in mind) the movie has a number of those great moments or lines that stick. It deals with the human condition regarding relations differently and without seeming driven to educate us, rather is entertains. Well worth your time.",8,0,2,20 January 2013
