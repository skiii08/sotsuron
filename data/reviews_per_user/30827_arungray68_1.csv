Despicable Me 2," Hilarious family film!
","Despicable Me 2 by Walt Disney Movies is great for so many reasons. It is pretty much viewable to anyone aged from 3 to 103 and they would enjoy Despicable Me 2 especially in the cinema, on the big screen. People mostly will love the minions' riot of anarchic slapstick with their antics and their strange delighted helium-induced jabbering's which are really the heart of this Disney movie. Best of all, the minions are mostly sweet and innocent, and represent so much the joy and exuberance of living in the moment that it's impossible for anyone to watch this film or give a film review and not be happy or give a positive review. I'm pretty sure that they will get their own movie at some point by obtaining DVD releases. The new DVD releases of the Despicable Me 2 movie is a must see after Despicable Me (part 1). Walt Disney did an outstanding job as usual and added the perfect touch Despicable Me so that Despicable Me 2 could be even better on DVD release.",9,1,1,3 January 2014
