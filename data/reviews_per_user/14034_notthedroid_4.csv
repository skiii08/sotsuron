Casablanca," Obviously a classic, and for good reason
","I could quote more lines from this movie than many others without having seen it because of its popularity and importance to popular culture. Yet having seen it a second time I was drawn in more and appreciated the acting and cinematography of the film. I was particularly taken with Humphrey Bogart and the nonchalant Rick, such an American as most of the world sees us! Rains' Renault was also a treat, not to mention Sam. The superimposition of maps was a nice touch, and the contrasting darkness of most of the action in Casablanca against the idyllic glimpse we are given of Paris makes their love despite the short time together convincing. I was told a back story about the time this was made and how it tied to the US involvement in the war before watching the film, and this made the anthems scene quite poignant. Needless to say, it's clear why this is a classic.",Null,1,2,10 May 2013
Taxi Driver," Wow
","New York City on summer nights has a certain feel to it, and 'Taxi Driver' managed to capture the intensity of its atmosphere. De Niro does an amazing job as the disturbed Bickle, who acts irrationally and in ways which may escape the audience, but this is suitable to his character, his mindset. The perspective of being in the cab, seeing his point of view, adds to this and draws you further into the scummy side of the city. The problems Foster's character faces are still all too relevant today forty years later, and this movie is great in turning a murder into a heroic act and revealing the trafficking and exploitation of young people as the crime. Even after such an iconic movie focusing on the subject it is an issue largely ignored. Calling Bickle a hero is questionable, not only because of his actions but because of his mental state as well. He is constantly lonely and sinking into psychosis throughout, with the dark photography and despicable New York as the perfect backdrop.",Null,0,0,10 May 2013
Annie Hall," It's Woody Allen, of course
","Woody Allen seems to be a 'Love it or Hate it' sort of director, and I would definitely lean to the former, but somehow I'd never seen this movie before taking a film class. Glad I finally did! The use of asides and delineated plot-line are both brilliant, and Allen comes across as, well, Woody Allen, as always. I thought he was hilarious, though of course incredibly neurotic. This is a great look at American city life in the 1970's as well as a chronicle of romance. It gives a glimpse into intimate moments both pleasant and otherwise, while also taking chances to break the fourth wall and keep the audience engaged one-on-one with the main character. I also loved how even though it was realistic in many ways there were other moments that were unexpected in their impossibilityâ€”if only I could pull out my favorite directors or authors when someone was making a bad point about their work!",Null,0,0,10 May 2013
The Graduate," SPOILERS—great acting, not so sure, though...
","I really enjoyed this movie for the acting and cinematography, but found the storyline to be unsettling. Not only did Mrs. Robinson accuse Ben of raping her after seducing him into an affair, but his way of solving it was then to stalk Elaine in hopes of winning her back. Even at the end, the realization of what has happened sinks in and there is a feeling of uncertainty—which I liked, as that tends to happen when we take big leaps of faith or follow the heart—but he again just stole away a married woman! One who maybe shouldn't have been, but still, it echoes of what he did with her mother all summer long. I loved Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of such an uncertain time in a young person's life, the different emotions and latching onto something taking away care for all else, things for which we need to look out.",Null,0,0,10 May 2013
