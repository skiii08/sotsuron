The Blair Witch Project," The only appeal this film afforded me was it's concept.
","The best thing I can possibly say about The Blair Witch Project is that I didn't HATE a MAXIMUM  of thirty minutes of the movie.  Of those thirty minutes, twenty-two of those could have possibly been turned into an effective made for t.v. Halloween special.  {I have yet to see the film's companion piece which aired on the Sci-Fi Channel.  Perhaps they were able to salvage something redeeming from the sedative I sat through)Regarding the film's elements, had you cut out every utterance along the lines of {'What the F*** is goin' on here, man?', followed by an ever impressive 'I don't F***in' know, man!'}, the movie would be maybe 55 minutes long (a generous estimate).  Cut out the frequent and equally uninspired banter about their map, you are down to 35 minutes (seemingly).While watching this movie, I found myself amazed (at times perplexed and insulted) at this group's lack of common sense.  For instance; if you are lost in the woods and come across a running stream, follow the water downstream.  Odds are you will stumble upon signs of civilization sooner or later.  Some more good advice is to never part from camp in search of a comrade BEFORE daybreak, lest ye become lost yourself.I have noticed that people who like this movie say that people like myself (antagonists) have no imagination.  That those disappointed by Blair Witch were uneducated, searching for 'Freddy and Jason' to jump out and slay all. Not so.  It is my belief that Blair Witch suffered from 'Phantom Menace syndrome'.  Which simply means I was unable to empathize with any of these characters.  Whether they were running for their lives or desperately lost and wandering aimlessly through the woods.  Nothing.Yes, I understand that this was an 'indie' flick.  Filmed in only eight days using improve and costing only $25,000.  But to call it the freshest thing to grace the silver screen is irresponsible and completely false.I'm sorry but this film did nothing but make me mad.  My final observation (the last time I waste cranial function on 'the Blair Witch Project') is this; there is only one instance in this movie (two of them converse after one is lost.) where if you get up to retrieve a beverage, you will miss the only two minutes in the film spent on character development.  As for the rest of the film, I have seen more passion in a turnip.Anyway 'I want my money back.'  Do not waste your time.",Null,0,1,8 November 1999
Dark City," If your idea of a 'deep' movie is 'Smoky and the Bandit', you won't like Dark City.
","I personally was first drawn in by this film's warped appearance.  Yet as I began to watch, I realized that the movie was completely different than its advertisments had led me to expect (Admittedly, in a good way.)  But by the time Connelly's character appeared, singing a sultry version of Dean Martin's 'Sway' (crooned here by singer Anita Kelsey,) I was spellbound (by both the song and the girl.)Though Dark City was nothing I had suspected it would be, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  An extra special treat for those of us who are fans of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', was getting to hear Richard O'Brien reprise the voice of 'Riff Raff' embodied this time by the alien 'Mr. Hand.'",Null,0,1,31 October 1999
Toy Story 2," It was good, but I liked 'A Bug's Life' better.
","All I had heard about this movie was 'best of the year' and 'better than the first'.  What everybody failed to mention was that while it was a slight improvement over the origional, it was not beter than the last Pixar Pic, 'A Bug's Life'.  I will be more anxious to see the sequel to that one. 
I guess that my only disapointment was that they did not show more collectable toys at the collectors apartment.  (You would think that since the guy owned a toy store and that Pixar used to be a 'Lucas' company, that there would have been Star Wars action figure cameos.  But the only collectables you see are 'Woody's possie')One of my favorite parts of the movie though, was the 'walk on' done by 'Geri', (the old man from the short which proceeded 'Bug's Life'.) 
Aside from minor disappointments, 'Toy Story 2' is a solid movie, and about just as good as the first. (the story is almost as good, but the advanced graphics somewhat make up for it)",8,0,1,28 November 1999
Signs," Mixed bag of nuts, er . . . feelings.
","In THE WIZARD OF OZ, Dorothy and her 'posse' are mightily impressed by 'the great, all powerful Oz' until just before the end.  . . . 'Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.' . . . As I emerged from the theater after seeing SIGNS, I felt rather like Dorothy did upon her learning the truth behind the awesome hype of Oz.I really like THE SIXTH SENSE and (I'm in the minority here) I love UNBREAKABLE even more.  Unfortunately, too many elsewise amazing movies are deflated by a poor or mishandled denouement.  SIGNS is an explosive, well done film up until the last firework, which feels more like one of those white paper snappers you throw at the ground to make a popping noise. 
I can't, however, ignore the rest of the movie. MEL GIBSON et al deliver spectacular performances throughout.  Even M NIGHT himself does pretty good. If you want to see some wonderful film making, I recommend you see this movie, but . . .** Truely MINOR SPOILER below, be wary. **If you don't want to leave the theater frustrated, then at the point where JOAQUIN PHOENIX (Merrill) opens the door to leave the cellar, that is my cue for you to leave the theater and DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSION.",7,0,1,4 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," favorite moments from book to screen (nothing plot revealing)
","(minor spoilers, but only if you haven't read the book.)some of the more awe inspiring moments for me were The Rohirim riding into battle at Gondor, Faramir leading his troops into Osgillioth against impossible odds, the moment Pippin becomes a man (so to speak), and the whole of Minas Tirith bowing down to four halflings, who might earlier have been dismissed as insignificant... it's moments like these that allow you to forgive the hollywood showboating of Orlando Bloom on the battlefield, and other such excesses.",10,0,0,10 January 2004
