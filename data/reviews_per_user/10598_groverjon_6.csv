First Man," An 8 for Gosling and Foy, cinematographic style and gravitas, a 5 for the soundtrack and overall effect
","In a nutshell....Armstrong wasn't much fun, he had some tough breaks, he's very dour. Space exploration is scary , loud and it's amazing they ever got to the moon.Neil isnt particularly exciting to watch for nearly 2.5hrs but I suppose that's what he was like and was picked as he could keep his cool under any pressure. But does it make for an interesting film- yes as its 'different' and 'no'.Think some of the 'here's me looking thoughtful again' scenes could've been trimmed.Gosling and Foy were great - but again i didn't really feel that much watching them as they don't interact that much even on screen as Armstrong is so withdrawn at times. Does he deserve an oscar nomination for this- mmmm my personal opinion is no. An oscar nomination for moping on screen for hours...no.The space/test flight scenes and cinematography were excellent and had me on the edge of my seat- no faulting them- just incredible.The soundtrack was a bit too 'documentary' style and loud at times but i understand this is what they were possibly going for....ploddy.",6,0,0,7 November 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Choked by Jokes, Thor- Fishing for Funny Gags - Beginners Gude
",If you like goofball comedies it's great.If you like big shiny CGI and blustering action sequences and fights its great.If you like high campery and pantomime villains -ITS AMAZING.If you like endless jokes at the expense of any real character or story development in place of any type of gravitas and epicness-ITS PERFECT.I personally don't like much of the above....You'll see it and forget about it 30mins later but tell all your friends how funny it was....One redeeming feature- it felt like a zany comic book made into a film and wasn't mopey and angsty like recent X-men MCU offerings.,1,500,944,31 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star wars - The Rise of The Jedisney! Star Wars stripped of elegance, beauty and story..It all felt FORCED :-(
","Star Wars is sadly no longer set 'a long time ago in a galaxy, far, far away'.It has been ripped apart by Disney and Rian Johnson's modernisation / Disneyfication that leaves the hollow ring of 21st century western culture and dialogue ringing throughout.For all JJ Abrams unoriginality in TFA's he managed to be reverent to old and new and fuse the two elegantly together - like there was balance in the force. I fear that balance has now been lost.Critics have applauded the bold moves taken in this film- but I disagree that they are many really positive bold moves at all.Can everyone remember everyone what Star Wars is/was ? (it doesn't matter if you are talking the originals, the prequels or the new films). It was somewhat larger than life, epic, a story of simple elements in conflict, sometimes dark , sometimes beautiful and wholly exciting - kids and adults yearned to live in that world -as it was fantasy and set apart. This film was like seeing a film of 'Star Wars trying to be like Guardians of The Galaxy , trying to be Star Wars' but with some quasi 21st century moral high ground thrown in....There's nothing wrong with 21st century thinking I applaud it- but there are a million other films that integrate it and comedy elements less heavy handed-ly. Rian Johnson failed with this in my opinion.It is therefore not bold to undermine the foundations of a much loved and well know saga with its own myth and legend and replace it with the common everyday way of doing things and nothing else -just cos one person feels like it.This is again my overriding issue - Disney and the director have now made most of the heros and plot devices in star wars every day things- i'm all for inclusion for all and liberalist non-elitism (i'm a minority member myself) but it doesn't work well in a world of fantasy and epic other worldliness.No wonder half the audience possibly despise it.For me the dialogue and plot of neither the prequels nor the originals ever reminded me of living in the 70s , 80s or 90s or 00s.This film reeked of today...! it stank of it.Remember it's supposed to be in ' a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away' !!!!!!!!!!! NOT TODAY.I can see people shooting me down already- the reason it doesn't work is two fold:-1.) it has some of the most banal set of l storylines in Star Wars -and even they were handled terribly. The ideas of Star Wars were treated condescendingly and crassly by the director in his (to be applauded) attempt to modernise the saga.In TLJ the trite explanation of 21st century vibes and attitudes to storytelling and film making is thrown in your face it distracts from the already non existent story....it's great to be progressive - but did it help the film be exciting? Did you feel like you were in another galaxy? Was the space chase exciting for you? where did it actually take you as an audience member? Where was the space Gas station when you needed it? Did we actually need it to be like a Marvel or other Disney film just cos that's what all the other films out there are like now?It was like Disney screamed 'we've got to get all this all inclusive stuff in here no matter what'. Shame as if these lessons weren't rammed in the audience's face it would ve come across nicely- then the Star Wars World would modernised- but not become obsessed with it suddenly.Examples .....
Rose and Finn - middle of war , less than 12hrs to find a solution- only worth the carnage of Canto Bight- cos they let the animals free. If they had let the animals free and Rose hadn't pointedly exclaimed ' now it's worth it ' that would've been cute, we 'd have got it... Instead it was puke worthy and rammed down your throat. Admiral Holdo -saves everyone by a suicide run with a huge ship - that's fine yep Disney are cool with that - no ship left no Holdo left....Then Finn tries to do suicide run 10mins later on a tiny ship to again (snore ) save the resistance- Disney not cool - cos someone he met 15 hrs ago (*Rose) decides it's wrong and says she loves him? whatever your view on this it's STUPID storytelling on face value in some way or another. And the whole bombing run suicide run thing had been used twice already!Yep Love is great and should win out - but in the middle of the battle field when you're all just about to die and you're fighting in a rebellion and love the greater good than yourself , saved by someone you hardly know and given a talk down?? (again- WTF? NOT THE RIGHT TIME!) Now Luke is dead too. Thanks Rose.We only needed some crystal critters to escape after all that ( I roll my eyes)Are the street children of Canto Bight going to sing Kum-By-Yah to the First Order and hope for the best in Episode 9?I could honestly see Episode 9 turning into a musical if Disney were anymore obviously intrusive and Ren running an orphanage of street urchins who sing along to songs from Mary Poppins.The plotlines only exist so the characters have something to do in this film - they don't actually really lead the characters anywhere important... 
There's a hundred more other things in this film that are designed to get a rise out of you as an audience member. A 5 year old could've imagined a better and less convoluted story.Possible reason why some people are upset:- It is a truth and a fact that Star wars has been at the pinnacle of popular sci fi / space operas since it exploded onto our screens. It is universal and is well loved.TLJ was like trying to dress up someone of the wrong age in new trendy fashionable clothes and failing. It is possble to succeed- but It has to be done sensitively , it can feel right and great , but you really have to get it right.  Rian Johnson didn't and you know that- you're still having to think about why it didn t feel epic and grand like ALL The other films.... In a nutshell what Disney and Rian have done is make it a sanitised version of 21st century 'living'....with lots of hyperspace suicide run and fuel issues!Ask yourself - is that what you want from a fantasy film set somewhere millions of galaxy's away? So for those who do like it and say yes -that is what I want.SWars is eventually going to be come tedious for you. It'll be like SWars Harry Potter but you don't even have to have a Hogwarts or magic training and everyone can have a Force Badge.... yippee! everyone happy - but less and less exciting. They'll be more stories that are there just to allow certain set pieces to happen but nothing else- but go buy more merchandise and forget the rest,:- you'll be happy when you see people always doing what's right on 21st century earth : - ** Star Wars The First Jedisney ' In a galaxy yesterday , near you'*For those who say no - who don't like the new order :- The Force is something you can now sweep the streets with, everyone talks like they are 20 somethings from middle class Californian families, everyone jokes like we do in the modern day. It is an all inclusive vision of star wars - (applause for Disney) -but it also undermines the very reason's why Star Wars works - it is too exemplary of our times and has removed the magic and 'special' powers that make Star Wars interesting as it is no longer pure escapism. It is a badly constructed 21st century Disney franchise product forever more.I can go and watch Star Trek for socio-political lessons with people stuck on spaceships with low fuel issues - but the genius of star wars was that you didn't have to worry about that, - you sensed its morals but not drowned in them - but most importantly you left this world behind and enjoyed the ride.TLJ is full of contrived technicalities and twists to get a rise our of the audience and undermine one of the most universally loved sci fi worlds in history. They do not serve the actors well, the characters well, the SW universe well or the audience. The SW universe Disney-fication will see future films become parallels of all other sci fi comedy and Disney films.
People say enjoy the film - it was fun and they've torn up the rule book too.You have to write a good story to do that, that both young and old fans can believe in the transition.I cannot remember watching ANY other SW film and thinking ' this is going to date so badly'... cos it's so obviously of our time and Disney schlock ideas.As audience members TLJ told us how what to do and how to feel about Star Wars and the choices it's character's made. That again is poor storytelling.Be flippant about Luke, be sweet about the animals living on Canto Bight and their lot in life, include badly costumed Victorian street children looking bleary eyed at the stars - but make sure it has resounding purpose and emotion and feels naturally part of that wold and universe.You also have to be able to suspend disbelief in any space opera/sci-fi/ fantasy film and everyone has their natural limit .You have to believe what is happening would possibly occur in any reasonable shape or form (regardless of physics etc). This film was non-sensical by half way through, the characters making unbelievable decisions at every turn.Will the next film be called 'Star Peace - The rise of the Jedisneys' ????I do hope so - as all the people who loved the new vibe will be happy and this review will be wholly justified - (whether you liked TLJ or not!)",1,4,7,11 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A bit of an obvious multicoloured trudge through the galaxy this time around
","The nice touches, camp golden Sovereign race who were exccellent on screen, (not so witty) wittybanter as the first film and lack of any real dynamic plot development let this film down from being a rollocking roller-coaster ride to a stately but colourful fairground carousel of a film.Pretty looking , pleasant , enjoyable, predictable in its own way- but not ever THAT exciting.It felt like a rainbow coloured candy store overload of sets and CGI effects. They just didn't make up for this obvious and dumbed down story.Mantis's character also seemed like a plot device just to allow the guardians to make Ego fall asleep at the showdown!She was lovely, sweet, funny but not really any reason for her to be in it as such -v little backstory.... But the story line of sitting on one planet, hanging around trying to work out who your real family are:- For me that didn't really suit the dynamic of the Guardians themselves.The plot line was a little obvious and instead of the heroic, resourcefulness of the team in the first film that added to the tension of the situation, there is little interesting interaction in the sequel aside from the arguments and the jokes that went with them .Do'nt get me wrong -they are some great things about this film but for me it lost itself in the eye popping but empty visuals that take over a lot of the scenes.The guardians need to find their own purpose again and some inspiration in the next offering...Still an enjoyable romp and some truly emotional and clever , spectacular moments and good banter..... chugging along on quite a slow, static storyline that didn't let the cast shine as much as the original.",5,6,13,2 May 2017
Alien: Covenant," The only question you'll now want answered about the Alien franchise is why they screwed it up so badly? Alien Snorathon.
","There are many viewpoints on Prometheus but for all its terribly stupid crew decisions and lack of 'horror' it opened up an almost endless seam of possibilities to take the mythology of Alien and I'd be very surprised if it didn't make 95% of the audience question something in the series , where what , why. Poorly executed but nice concept.Alien Covenant is basically Alien made for the millennials.... ' we must try and explain everything' we must make it easily digestible, we must get away from any open ended questions - today's society doesn't like open ended questions - it wants to know everything and it wants to know now! Hence this awfully obvious and drab film that takes away any myth or mystery we were getting into in the Prometheus.It's fine to make a space horror film - look at Alien ! it was amazing...But all of this film was just exposition and explanation - NOTHING INTERESTING left over.... bar possibly what David will do next and will Tenesee and whoever her name is in the cryotubes survive at all? But as Ridley Scott (surely under huge financial and other pressures from the Studio) does what we know what now to be true over and over - he'll kill off any continuation with any character you might have interest in....cos if ideas get complicated or edgy its just too much for most cinema goers. (blame the studios for this!) The Alien franchise just had a massive dumbing down regards the mythology of it all -and again the movie on screen was massively dumb in so many areas.Ridley said he thought it would be more interesting If David made the aliens (or helped create one /his own version of them) rather than those Engineers people.Who thinks this was big mistake? Uhhh duhhhhh!!! Even if you don't agree with me the alien is now just a hysterical lunatic walking human toaster gone wrong's experiment.Where's there terror in that ?where do we go from here? The films are coming out all wrong.Snore. Snore . Alien Snorathon.",2,7,16,28 May 2017
V for Vendetta," The people's vote is yes - the UK critics' is no!
","I did not know what to expect from this film and was unfamiliar with the story and characters of Alan Moore's graphic novel.But as I was soon to find out that did not really matter....I now feel extremely lucky to have experienced an amazingly gripping film that ...a) entertains in the most intelligent 'blockbuster' style possible, shot and directed with a good balance and measure of action , reflection, darkness , twists and turns with an awesomely topical storyline.b) tackles a variety of issues that affect us all, yes all of us!! c) has scenes and moments that ignite every emotion ..and most importantly of all, a film that makes us all aware of the need to take responsibility ,ourselves, for how we look at the world and those who have any influence on our everyday lives and the lives of others... and that from different perspectives the world is a vastly changed place.many films of a political persuasion these days weigh themselves down with telling you how to think. V for Vendetta just wants you to stop and think! That is all.Ironically enough the film's stance towards the USA is belligerent and acidly condemning, but most US based critics have embraced the film's refreshing stimulation of the average movie goers brain!However British critics say its not 'strong enough', and that it portrays england under a fascist regime as a land of people watching TV , going peacefully about their lives -a mediocre vision of the future that is pointless to analyse. They say it should have been set in America to make it more 'controversial' and hit home harder by tellin geveryone to be more anarchic...Its a film dealing with the idea of anarchy and extremism -not them itself!!!And tell me where a man dressed as Guy Fawkes, and how the centuries of politics in the UK could have been translated to the USA ....without changing the characters, timelines and style completely...I hate to say it but give the film makers a break!Lets not forget that the world in which main character V lives is a world where any minorities and dissidents have been removed- leaving only herds of 'average' middle class apathetic people who conform to all the rules and believe all they read and see in the press...more or less most of us today....And if you see the film :- remember you don't need to know 'everything' about the characters -because the film wants you to decide if they are good/bad/crazy/sane, form their attitudes , action and ideas -NOT from who they were, which side they fight for or where they came from! (Most UK critics complain that the characters are superficially dealt with.. in terms of depth of character and background)So go decide whether you want to become another member of the herd and enjoy the ride in the meantime. I did! A staggering film- a film for our times.",10,2,5,25 March 2006
