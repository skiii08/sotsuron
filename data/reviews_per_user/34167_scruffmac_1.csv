Iron Man 3," Shane Black puts his stamp on it!
","Shane Black is going to be a very busy man once the box office draw comes in on Ironman 3. If you've seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from 2005 you'll know that Shane Black knows how to make a well balanced original movie. Ironman 3 continues that habit. Expect to see a lot more Shane Black directed movies. Downey Jr. seems to be enjoying himself more than ever as Tony Stark. Probably because he Tony Stark isn't slowly dying of blood poisoning like in the second film. All the supporting cast are great. Particularly Guy Pearse and Ben Kingsley.Best points of the film;1. Downey Jr. is at his very best.2. A very well written, witty script helps keep the humor flowing, and not just from Downey. Everybody gets to have fun, and be funny in this flick.3. Well paced and a great balance between plot, action, drama and humour.4. Surprising and original. (nothing goes the way you think it will)It's now my favourite Ironman movie. Possibly better than The Avengers. It's a great start to the Blockbuster season!",9,6,16,25 April 2013
