The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not so good like the previous 2
","The film has not really a lead-in. It starts in the middle of the action. And it stops also there. It's like the film wants to say 'I'm a sequel and I will have a sequel too.'There's less action than in 'Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' because Katniss and Peeta don't participate in the Hunger Games this time. Because of that there's also not so much tension. During some phases the film is a bit boring.The actors did a good job. Jennifer Lawrence is not as good as usual, but Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson are great. Liam Hemsworth was a positive surprise. His appearance in Expendables 2 was horrible, but this time he was quite good. Maybe he's not so much less talented than his brother Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth. Natalie Dormer from Game of Thrones was nice. It was good to see Philip Seymour Hoffman. After he died I thought somebody else would play Plutarch, but obviously they finished the films before Seymour Hoffman died.The visual effects of the first 2 films were much better, but this one has also some nice scenes. Like the liberation of Peeta which looks a bit like Operation Neptune's Spear.The biggest strength of the film is the topic of the medial war and psy ops. The rebels and the government are fighting much more in the media than on the battlefield. I liked the way how the film treats this topic.",7,12,25,6 December 2014
John Wick," Nice Action Film
","People who like films like the Punisher, Taken, Man on Fire and similar films...films about men with bad destinies who go out to take their revenge...well people who like this kind of films will also like John Wick. The film is not really deep or something (compared to Taken or 96 Hours for example) but there's a lot of action and it's really entertaining. After Matrix I thought for a long time, that Reeves started to act in all his roles too cool, without a lot of mimics and gestures. As John Wick that would have been totally okay, because he plays a cold-blooded hit-man. But no, Reeves acts very well. I really had to laugh in the scene where Iosef, aka Alfie Allen aka Theon Greyjoy appears for the first time. In the same moment Wick puts the gas pump into the tank. I'm not sure if the directors have realized the hidden symbolic and the joke...but yeah, people who watch Game of Thrones will know what I'm talking about. It was funny.",8,1,6,21 January 2015
American Sniper," That film will split the audience
","American Sniper will split the audience in two (or maybe more) groups. Pacifist will see it totally different than people who were in a war or at least aren't totally against it. A biography of a young man, a sniper...he has to kill mothers and children...he becomes a father by himself and can't kill a kid that easy anymore...he wasn't able to protect all his fellow soldiers...he has to fight against a guilty conscience...against post-traumatic stress disorder. The film is often like the mission of a sniper. It happens nothing for a long time and you just wait for something...for some action. And then, all of a sudden you get more action than you can handle. Coincidence? If yes it's a weakness of the movie, because there are really boring parts...but if that's no coincidence, if they wanted to make a film about a sniper which is like the mission of a sniper...well, they did and it's brilliant.",8,31,61,20 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Not so bad
","It's not so easy to watch a film and write a review when you have seen so many bad reviews before. In the most cases written by people who have reed the book 'the hobbit'. I didn't read 'the Hobbit' and I didn't read the 'Lord of the Rings'-trilogy. But yes, you can see the difference in the two film trilogies clearly. One is based on three books and the films are full of action and really long...the other one is based on one book and they tried really hard to fill the gaps...but the films are shorter, less actions, sometimes boring. Nevertheless, I enjoyed 'The Battle of Five Armies'. It's entertaining and you don't have the feeling that it won't end like 'The Return of the King'. If I would have read the books I would be angry too because of characters like Legolas who doesn't appear in the book. But if you want to see a film and be entertained, you can watch 'The Battle of Five Armies' and enjoy it. It's possible.",6,1,7,20 January 2015
