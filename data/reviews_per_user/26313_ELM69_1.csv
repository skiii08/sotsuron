The Blair Witch Project," A great end to a great movie
","I have read some reviews, and alot of people say they didn't like the ending.  But I feel that the ending was the most horrifying 10 mins. ever put on to film!!  I loved that there was no explanation.  And since it was just thier footage being shown, there would be anyway to explane.  I just can't get that image of Mike in the corner of the room out of my head.  I live in the country, so the woods by my bedroom always have noise.  But now it gets to me.  And I didn't sleep the first night after I saw it.  I greatly applaud the filmakers for there origanl idea.",10,1,3,5 August 1999
