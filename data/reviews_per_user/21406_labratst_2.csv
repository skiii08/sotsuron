Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't watch this movie through rose colored glasses
","The most common complaint about this movie seems to be that it didn't live up to the original.  I get the impression that a lot of these comments come from people who first saw them on video and had the benefit of being able to watch the trilogy back to back.  I remember when Star Wars (nobody called it 'A New Hope') first came out. Everybody I knew thought Luke was a whiny little pipsqueak.  Chewie annoyed us.  Lea was hot.  Han was cool.  Vader scared the poo-doo out of us.  C-3PO and R2-D2 were funny.  Before 'Empire' came out, rumors were flying that Luke and Han would be killed on Hoth.  We all thought that would be sad, but would run with it.  Not to wax too 'back in my day', but when we saw a movie, someone was telling us a story.  Now everyone wants a say in the story.  I'm no fan of Jar-Jar but I can appreciate his place in the story.  My biggest gripe is that his dialogue was written by Mike Myers for Waynes World ie. 'esqueeze me'. I thought Phantom Menace was a great Sci-Fi fantasy movie and it gives a lot of insight into some of the stock characters from the first trilogy. I've lived my life as a huge Star Wars buff.  But I will admit that most of the acting and writing in the first three films sucks if you watch it like you're watching The Godfather.  These are fun, fantasy, comic book style movies.  And as far as the CGI characters, how stupid would people in battle droid costumes looked?  Or the Gungans for that matter?  At least now, all the aliens don't have to look like humans with bigger heads and mouths",Null,1,2,23 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," No, this was not a mistake....
","First of all........LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!   Instead of a regular review, Ijust want to make a point about something in this movie that hasconfused a lot of people.  In the world of Star Wars, the technologythey have has existed a lot longer than it has on Earth.  The reasonthe ships and stuff look 'cooler' in the prequels is because we areseeing a thriving society at the height of it's development.  In the'original trilogy', we are seeing a galaxy torn apart by years ofwarfare.  The rebellion will be using, for the most part,  throwntogether equipment that has to be maintained on the fly byvolunteers and such.  The Empire will have destroyed much of thefacilities that existed and will also using what they can producethemselves.     Imagine if a global nuclear war happened here in the next 5years.  50 years from now, we wouldn't be flying around in neatohoverships and watching nifty 3-D holographic television.  Wewould still be rebuilding.      Just wanted to clear this up for the people who have a hard timewrapping their brains around logic.",Null,0,1,5 May 2003
