Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," SEE IT AT LEAST TWICE!
","If, like me you were born around the time of the third Star Wars movie, which was the original(Huh?), I don't think it is then fair for you to make a judgement until you see it again, and again, and again. We grew up on these movies, we would've been to young at the time to form any opinion, and so any opinion we(or at least I) have is from repeated viewings. I grew to love the first ones. I'm sure I will feel the same with this one. Besides, It's still better than any other movie since possibly 'Braveheart'. Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd are absolutely wonderful, as is the rest of the cast...even Jar Jar grew on me. As to the racist 'accents' and stereotypes; I noticed more than just asian accents thank you very much, why must all alien species speak with American, English, or Australian accents anyway?To think everyone speaks in the same tongue is ludicrous, but I suppose more subtitles might've been better. Before I go, make sure you look at the young Greedo in the Pod Race scene, it's very amusing. SO STOP YOUR WHINING",10,0,0,4 June 1999
Romeo + Juliet," Lurhmann goes John Woo in this terribly over-the-top film. Watch the classic '67 version instead.
","Leo, as Romeo seems like he's at a recital and the others aren't much better(he can act- see Gilbert Grape). The Franco Zefferelli version walks all over this disaster. It was never a good idea. The actors are not convincing, and the language is not convincing in this setting. Luhrmann and Craig Pearce obviously thought they were being smart by using Shakesperean language in a modern setting, but it comes  off pretentious and unintentionally hilarious. The characters of Mercucio, Tybalt(the surprisingly solid John Leguizamo) and Friar Lawrence(unde- rrated Pete Postlethwaite) are OK, but Paul Sorvino and Brian Dennehy are wasted, and most of the dialogue is shouted (particularly the opening scene) making much of it incoherent when not downright stupid. Leo is awful(girls don't e-mail me with your hate mail!-Unless you're good lookin'!), but Claire Danes is almost passable (she's no match for Olivia Hussey). Too much flash and noise.",Null,1,2,10 January 1999
Forrest Gump," The greatest film of all time
","You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll just have a darn good time. Tom Hanks gives the performance of his career, one year after his other brilliant performance in Jonathan Demme's masterpiece Philadelphia. The supporting cast is flawless, and the soundtrack would have to be right up there with the Star Wars soundtrack as the best ever, including my personal favourite Creedence Clearwater Revival. Anyone who says this film only won Oscars because, like Rain Man it was about an idiot, has no idea what they are talking about. Citizen Kane may be the greatest film of all time on a technical level, and I do love it, but is it as magical as this film?I think not.",10,2,4,12 September 1998
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A rarity in hollywood. Better than the original.
","It starts out much the same as the 1984 original(which I must confess I hated as a kid), but this time James Cameron and co. have managed to improve on that film in every aspect, particularly the mind blowing FX and a strong performance from Linda Hamilton. One of the all-time greats, as is its predecessor(I'm full of contradictions so don't think I don't know what you're thinking).",10,2,2,12 September 1998
Face_Off," 'ConAir' had more brains than this garbage. It was funnier too.
","I hate John Travolta and Nic Cage(Please don't e-mail me with your hate mail). They have both been in good movies('Look Who's Talking', 'ConAir', 'Get Shorty', and even 'Phenomenon' and 'Guarding Tess') but Cage turned in the worst performance ever by an actor in the little-seen Coppola project 'Deadfall', and was also awful in the remake of 'Kiss of Death'(Sam Jackson rules!). He goes over-the-top as a baddie, and came across as slightly irritating as a good guy in OK films like 'Honeymoon in Vegas'(Love that Sarah Jessica Parker')and lesser ones like 'It Could Happen to You', 'Trapped in Paradise' et al. Travolta was in the godawful, unintentionally funny 'Saturday Night Fever', he was overrated in the overrated, unnecessarily yucky 'Pulp Fiction'(Sam Jackson still rules!), was pathetic as a baddie in 'Broken Arrow', and he dances too much.I can't believe the critics love this so much. The plot is dumber than a 'police Academy' flick. It's too flashy(I like standard 'Commando' or 'T-2' actioners)and stylish(The next time I see slow motion, or a guy holding two guns in a John Woo movie, I am going to shoot myself!!!) and the actors are awful when playing baddies(they swap faces or something). It's true, they're not too bad when they are playing the John Travolta federal agent character, and the ending is nice, but this flick is too long, too over-the-top, too dumb, and I HATE Nic Cage and John Travolta!(They seem nice in real life, though). Gets a C+(average) simply because I don't want hordes of teenage girls beating the bejesus out of me. Actually, yes I do, but that's another story...",1,6,15,17 September 1998
Good Will Hunting," I don't wish to sound patronising, but this is a good first try.
","Excellent performances from most of the cast, realistic dialogue, solid direction(From Gus Van Sant who has worked on 'My Own Private Idaho' and 'Drugstore Cowboy'), and some powerful moments make this 1997 Oscar winner(for Screenplay) watchable. The screenplay, for my mind was the problem. It's a good debut, but it's too familiar(eg. 'Educating Rita' and the novel 'Maestro' By Peter Goldsworthy'). It's your typical teacher-student film. My brother would like it to be known that I was wrong about the ending, but I wasn't totally wrong, Damon and Ben Affleck are rock solid, and Robin Williams richly deserved his Oscar for another nicely subdued performance(it's a pity he's always playing doctor types). Stellan Skarsgaard and particularly Minnie Driver(sporting her real english accent, which sounds more superficial than her irish or american) are irritating, however. Driver gets a huge laugh though in one scene. Ben and his brother Casey Affleck also have funny moments, as does Matt Damon(a bit egotistical to put himself in the lead, though). Nice, but we've seen it all before.",Null,0,1,4 January 1999
Pulp Fiction," I love violence and language but this is an excessively crude film from a show-off video store clerk turned director.
","'Pulp Fiction' has two things going for it; Sam Jackson(robbed at the Oscars) and Christopher Walken(who has the film's funniest sequence. But that's all. The Tim Roth/Amanda Plummer scenes are irritating and too profane(swearing's great, but not like this). The Bruce Willis 'Gimp' scene is memorable but a little sicko, and The Uma Thurman sequence(you know the one) is absolutely unbearable. She and Travolta(too fat to dance and never a terrific actor) almost ruin this 1994 Tarantino film single handedly. But no, it is Tarantino himself that ruins the film; everyone is nasty, it's excessive, the way the three stories are told is confusing, and...that's about it. Some of it is funny, and Ving Rhames is good as Marsellus Wallace, but this is too much for me. I know many like Tarantino, but I think he's a show-off in the grand tradition of John Woo(one of his heroes apparently).",1,40,92,4 January 1999
Titanic," Why pay 9 bucks to see a three hour film you know the ending to?
","I must've been drunk. The acting is wooden, the character development almost non-existent and the music irritating(I HATE Celine Dion). The FX are great, but who cares?. Of the cast, Leo has one good moment at the end, but it drags on. Kate looks terrible in her costumes, but it's nice to see she's not a twig. Pity she can't act. Billy Zane has seldom shown restraint, and this film is no exception. Oscar winner Kathy Bates, however is solid as an iceberg...er...rock as the 'unsinkable' Molly Brown, but she can't save it. Jim Cameron has been responsible for many screen classics, but this isn't one of 'em. The dialogue is extremely funny. To give you an indication of how much I luuurrvved this film, the Federal election was on at the same time, and I decided to watch a bit of that!Would I have enjoyed it more on the big screen?Dialogue and characterisation is no different at the cinemas. The worst academy award nominated film of the year, but that's not saying much.",1,7,17,3 January 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," My best friend Antony knows every line in this classic movie. What is it about this movie that attracts the nutters?
","This 1974 flick is one of the all time greats. You either love it or loathe it, much like the other Python flicks. Many like 'The Life of Brian' more than this, but despite 'Bigus Dickus', it's nowhere near as funny as this bloody tale of Arthur, King of the Britons('King of the WHO?'), and his knights of the Round Table; Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Bedevere, Sir Robin the-not-so-brave as Sir Lancelot, and Sir-not appearing in this film. In their quest for the holy grail, they encounter Tim the Enchanter, the Knights who say Ni, a ferocious bunny rabbit('With big great pointy teeth'), and a horde of foul temptress virgins. Not to mention the Black Knight. Classic stuff...just don't tell anyone you like it, or they'll think you're a nerd...oops, too late. Cast includes John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael'The Nice One'Palin, Eric Idle, Neil Innes, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Carol Cleveland etc.",10,0,0,19 September 1998
