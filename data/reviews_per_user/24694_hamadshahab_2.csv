Requiem for a Dream," Not just a movie about drugs!
","The film is depressing , but it has a great meaning. The movie gives you a dose of hope, not a lot of movies did it bsfore . The movie deserves to be watched every time. The movie wants to tell you a great meaning, but in a harsh style. Everyone has a dream you have to make an effort to achieve it, but if you don't your dream will die. This fatigue literally means effort, hardship, and sweat. You have to be at the end to achieve your dream. This is the meaning of the movie. It warns you with the utmost directness, do not underestimate the stage of your trouble or wash your brain that you are passing this stage with minimal losses. All this will be understood if you see the movie through the characters and their dreams. The way of directing in this movie is fantastic , which you will not see in many movies, for example a film shot is that two characters are together at the same time and place, but the screen is divided, and this has a very great meaning, and that you are separated from your dream. Music is more famous than the movie itself, so I will not say anything about it. The performance of the actors: What was required of them is not very high performance, but they were required to perform a variety, beginning with a dream with joy, the period of drug use, loss and remorse. All of them performed well except for Sara Goldfarb . She performed above the splendid between the mother's tenderness in the beginning and then being happy in her dream, and in the end the case of madness that reached her at the end, and to any actress that could have come out of the tragic performance of the comic comedy. Simple hair and will separate the two performances, but she stood with all greatness on the edge of tragic performance. If the movie was bad in the beginning and the end is beautiful and great, the whole movie remains great. Imagine the whole movie is great and the end is greater than what you imagine. This is what Darren Aronofsky did when the events reached the end. All this in order to receive all suffering on your chest and feel it.
A rare, great, fantastic movie!",10,0,0,3 May 2020
Gone Girl," When Devil is dressed as an angel
","This movie reminds me of the movie ,,The Hunt''.
Its the same perspective which is the victim is the Devil himself.
