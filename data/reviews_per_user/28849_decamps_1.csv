Raiders of the Lost Ark," Typical stupid American film
","The 'raiders of the ark' is probably a genre by itself.It is not an action film. You should not expect more than a couple of gunfires and some whisp tricks. Is it realistic? Not at all, except if you consider that a man can move a pyramid's hone to escape from the pyramid.It is not humoristic, either (is there a single play on words?). Actually, it is rather completely stupid. A typical scene is the guy who sees a skeleton and howls like a fool for five seconds.The scenario is very boring. There is not a single second of suspense.Ironically, what makes the film watchable is the soundtrack. No, actually, it is not sufficient, I stopped watching near the end.Really, I don't understand how many people can consider this crap deserves to be watched. How can it be in the top 250 ?",3,42,103,15 September 2004
