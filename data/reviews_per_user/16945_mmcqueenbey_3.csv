Scarface," The world is always yours if you want it
","Scarface is by far one of my favorite movies to ever come out. I seen this movie at a young age but it always stuck with me because of the reality of the storyline and what it can teach you. Al pachino was definitely the best actor for this movie and u couldn't see any other actor playing this. It's like he lived this role day in and day out. It all starts in Cuba, where AL pachino is sent to and he then gets his card to come to America and does so. He realizes that Cuba and America is completely different and you have to make a new living if you want money, power, and respect. So he finds a couple of connects and works his way up to the top with power by any means necessary. This includes murder and a numerous of other crimes. He kills his boss and starts working with a new boss who gets him lots of money. They realized he was changing but he didn't care because of the power he had so he used drugs and the movie gets better as it goes on.",10,2,5,30 March 2016
Deadpool," A very hilarious movie
","Deadpool is a vigilante that has well earned his own movie. We all began to gain respect for him and ask for him in his first appearance in X men. From that day forwards we knew deadpool would become a wonderful character. This movie did way better than what people actually thought it would do. They chose the perfect actor (Ryan Reynolds) to do this hilarious movie. It give you everything that you want in a movie from action to comedy to a nice little love story. If these are your guidelines for a movie and your a marvel comic book fan, you definitely should go and view this movie for yourself. Or if your just trying to have a Romantic date with your loved one then you can do this too. The best thing to do is give the movie a chance and see what everyone has been raving about.",9,3,16,29 February 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformers never fails
","Transformers is by far a classic. Every little kid growing up wanted to own a car that could transform in to a robot/super awesome car. If you never grew up watching transformers, you should take a step back in time and relive your childhood. When they made a real movie I was more than excited, I wanted to go to the movie and watch them all day because my childhood heroes finally became realistic. The first 2 movies was definitely a bang and I anticipated this movie just as much and maybe even more than the others. Once it came out I went to the movie theater just like I did with the first 2 and once again Michael bay and Shia Lebouf never fails. The animation and graphics for this movie is just out of this world. All of his story lines was always on point and you just learn more and more every movie. Optimus prime will always be number 1 and he just takes over each movie. His supporting autobots get better and better each year. As they transform you get more and more details. I love this movie so much. If no one hasn't watched it, turn your TV on and proceed in searching for this movie.",9,5,5,23 May 2016
