Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the most overhyped films EVER! PERIOD!
","Hands up anyone who thinks that George Lucas should be shot for ruining a great series of films. Okay, so he did direct Episode IV which is in many peoples views one of the greatest films ever, fair enough, but that doesn't excuse him from the travesty he has now created. It seems that he has lost the plot a wee bit when it comes to telling a story. In this day and age, special effects are now advancing to a point where in some cases they are overshadowing the story. This certainly seems to be the case with Episode I. There is a plot there, the only problem is that you have fight your way through loads of special effects, as good as they are, to get to it. Even the acting is abysmal. It's about as wooden as what you'd find in a Z-grade soap opera. What a waste of talented actors such Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson hey. Lucas is technical director not an actors one and it shows.It would have been a wise choice to let his mate, fellow Beard, Steven Speilberg to have a bash at directing an episode to show how incompetent Lucas really is when it comes to telling a story. Even Peter 'Bad Taste' Jackson would be more than an ample choice at helming an episode as he has definitely proved his worth with the first two Lord of the Rings installments.A word of advice George, give it up while you're still in front. Episodes IV - VI are great films and that's what they'll be remembered for, not some money making scheme that the new films appear to be.",2,0,1,31 January 2003
The Ring," Once you've read this, you will die in seven days.
","As far as remake's go, Gore Verbinski's version of the Japanese horror film Ringu is one of the rarities that are as good as the original.Based on the same premise as it's predecessor, The Ring is about a mysterious video tape that when viewed, causes the watcher to die in seven days. Reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) catches wind of said tape after her niece dies under mysterious circumstances after reportedly viewing such a tape. She then tracks down the tape and views it for herself. Then what follows is a race against time as not just to save her own life, but the life of her son who accidentally watches it.What makes The Ring stand out is it relies on genuine scares and psychological terror to strike fear into the audience. Whereas most films use the 'it's-only-a-cat' routine, there is nothing in the movie that leaves the audience screaming at something ludicrous.In terms of acting, it is of high quality, especially from the Haley Joel Osment type sprog who has a sixth sense type of ability (that's being able to see dead people for those who haven't been initiated to the genre).Verbinski has proved himself a worthy director and the movie could stand him in good stead for future blockbuster's. It will also make you think twice about going down to the local video shop to hire out the latest titles. You never know, you may get a phone call saying you will die in seven days after watching it.",8,1,1,13 March 2003
Constantine," Good movie that has been to hell and back.
","O.k., Keanu Reeves is hardly Oscar winning material but somehow always manages to land some top roles ie The Matrix, Speed and now Constantine. Here he plays the title character from the Hellblazer comics John Constantine who has the ability to see angels and demons that roam the Earth in human form. It's his job to rid the world of all the demons in the hope that the man upstairs will give him redemption so he can get into Heaven. However there is a slight glitch in his plan in the fact that he is a 30 a day smoker since the age of 15, drinks heavily and only cares about number one. When he was a child, he committed suicide to escape the ability that he has but was revived after being declared clinically dead for two minutes. During that time he went down to Hell. All this adds to Constantines' character. Plot wise, Constantine is fairly easy to understand with Rachel Weisz playing a cop who's investigating her twin sisters' death. She asks Constantine for help as he is the only one who can give her the answers that she needs. While this is going on, there is a far a greater evil lurking which may be tied in with all this.As with all comic book, or any kind of literary adaptation, there will always be differences between the two mediums. This is something that will add annoyance to fans of the comic as there is bound to be alterations no matter how small, but this is the movies and things will be changed for whatever reason. It would be unfair to totally slate this movie as, from someone who is not a comic book reader, this is a decent enough movie, even if some of the performances are not exactly award winning.The special effects are of a good quality even if things do appear a bit ropey at times. Constantine flows through smoothly and even though it doesn't live up to the hype generated by the trailers it's a fun a couple of hours.",8,0,3,1 April 2005
Aliens," This time it's not just war, it's a kick a**e follow on to an all time classic!
","How often does a sequel live up to, or even surpass its predecessor. The answer is quite simply, rare and Aliens is one of those rarities.Set 57 years after Ripley's original encounter with cinema's most notorious intergalactic beastie, she is awoken from hyper-sleep to do battle with not just one, but an entire horde of intergalactic beasties. This time she is sent with a bunch of marines to the planet where she first unwittingly picked up the original alien as contact with a colonial crew based there has been lost. When they arrive, there appears to be no one there so they have to search the entire complex. They eventually come across a little girl called Newt (Carrie Henn). After a while they locate some of the crew. This then sets the ball rolling as they discover that there are not alone.Aliens is a completely different film from Ridley Scott's original. It is essentially a war film with humans invading the aliens home turf as it were and they are fighting back. It has the elements of sci-fi and horror too. Scott's film is essentially a haunted house in space and focuses more on the horror aspects. It would be unfair to say which one is better as both directors have different visions and these two films are totally different from each other. It's down to personal preference as to which one is someone's favourite as both Scott and James Cameron have their own fan base.Aliens is best seen in its special edition form as it elaborates more on the relationship between Ripley and Newt. It gives more of a back story to the two characters as well.This film is definitely well worth an inclusion in any film buffs catalogue of great films.",9,0,0,14 February 2005
The Exorcist," Captain Howdy made me do it.
","Way back in 1973, one Oscar winning director was asked to adapt a top selling novel by William Peter Blatty. This director being Wiliam Friedkin, who has made probably the best known horror movie of all time,The Exorcist.A 12-year-old girl inadvertently becomes possessed by a demon called Pazuzu after playing with an Ouija board. The doctors think that she has something wrong inside her head, but her mother soon comes to think otherwise. The only way that she can be saved is to be exorcised.Based on a supposedly true event, The Exorcist was THE most shocking movie of its' time. In this day and age it may not shock as it did then but can still pack a powerful punch for those who believe in the power of possession and God and the Devil.Acting is top notch with Ellen Burstyn knocking in an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a leading role. The Version You've Never Seen is for hardcore fans only and movie purists, the spider-walk being the most talked about scene and the one fans wanted to see most.Overall a good movie but not great but definitely influential.",9,0,1,3 April 2005
Men in Black II," Two great actors in one disappointing sequel.
","Set five years (why is it always five?) after the first Men In Black, Agent J (Will Smith) has now been working in New York helping to keep the aliens under control. He is also getting through partners at lighting speed. However, he soon gets a chance to work with an old partner again in the form of Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). Unfortunately, he is now working as a postal worker who has no memory that he was once working for the highly secretive organization known as the Men In Black. It is down to J to get K back to the MIB HQ and to get his memory back as he is the only person who has the key to save the Earth from the new alien threat.It is common belief that if a formula works to repeat that formula. Trouble is, when it has been done once it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to work as well the second time round. This seems to be the case for MIB II. There are some familiar faces from the first film who have much more deserved screen time. Remember the pawn shop owner who had his head blown off, or how about the worms and Frank the Pug. Only trouble is there is nothing really new about the film in the fact it is just basically a repeat of the first with a few extensions on things that we've already seen.Men In Black II is a disappointing shame as it wastes two superb actors in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith who look plain bored and just want to get it out of the way. On a more technical note, the film is superb with some great special effects on display which keeps you watching to see what those wonderful boys at George Lucas' ILM (Industrial Light + Magic) are going to come up with next.To finish off on a brighter note, the film does have its' funny moments and will put a smile on your face with the Frank the Pug stealing the show.",5,0,0,7 August 2002
The Evil Dead," One of the finest horror debuts ever.
","Sam Raimi's directorial debut is a gore filled beauty of a film. It may not have award winning acting, but hey, who cares, it's still a load of fun to watch. Filmed on a micro-budget, 'The Evil Dead' is about five teenagers who are on vacation in a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. While there, they discover a book with ancient texts and a tape recorder which contains translations of said texts. Unwittingly, they play back the tape and unleash a horde of evil spirits that are lying dormant within the woods. What follows is a rollercoaster ride of mayhem and scares with a touch of humour. Director Raimi has created a cult classic and this is one movie that will be remembered throughout the annals of horror movie history. There are clear elements of inspiration in the film. Tobe Hooper's 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and George A. Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' are to name but two, which then only adds to the ferocity of the film. This is for hardened horror fans and will no doubt attract future fans to the genre. 'The Evil Dead' is a one hell of a ride.",10,0,0,27 July 2002
Groundhog Day," Stuck in the same day over and over again? Then it must be GROUNDHOG DAY.
","Imagine what it would be like to repeat the worst day of your life over and over again. This is the dilemma for weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) who is stuck in the one day of the year he hates the most, Groundhog Day.Set in a small town called Punxatawny, there is an annual event in which a groundhog 'predicts' wether there will be another six weeks of winter or an early spring. Phil Connors has covered this event for three years and is hoping this will be his last but fate seems to have other ideas. Once the festivities are over Connors, cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot) and producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) start to make their way back to Pittsburgh when they are suddenly hit by a blizzard that Phil had wrongly predicted would pass over them. With the long distance phone lines down and no way out of Punxatawny, Phil is at his wits end as he wants to leave as soon as he possibly can. When he thinks things couldn't get any worse, they do and Phil wakes up to find that he has woken up on February 2nd, Groundhog Day.Directed by Harold Ramis (Stripes, Caddyshack) Groundhog Day is undoubtedly one of the finest comedies to grace the silver screen. With a screenplay that was co-written by Ramis alongside Danny Rubin, the movie never lets up. At first, Connors thinks that he must be in his own personal hell but soon realises that when he wakes up on the third day he can do whatever he wants without any consequences. Even committing suicide doesn't make any difference. Once he finds out that he can't die he turns his attentions to his producer Rita to try and win over her affections.Each day is met with a new twist and turn and for a movie with a concept such as simple as this then someone with a mind for ideas only need apply. There is always something new going on but it only works if you have some great talent working not only behind the camera but in front of it too and that's where Bill Murray comes in. There is not one moment that is dull or boring when Murray is on screen. Every scene turns to gold when he is on screen and there is an immediate chemistry between him and Andie MacDowell.
Ramis has done an absolutely magnificent job in turning such a simple idea into a work of cinematic art. Bill Murray has once again proved he is a comedic talent to be reckoned with and will remain that way for generations to come.",9,0,0,23 September 2002
War of the Worlds," Not one of Speilbergs best.
","!!!!!POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!!! As the saying goes, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. It can easily be said about this. War of the Worlds sticks to the basic premise of the original but it also has the traditional Spielberg trademark stamped all over it. This being the essence of a broken family or strained relationships that occur within a family and the struggle to bring them together. The common day everyman that becomes a hero from saving the moment from unfamiliar or more powerful obstacles.This is what differs the most from the original. In the original, now there is only a vague explanation in the new one, the aliens come from Mars because there planet has become uninhabitable and an explanation as to why they have chosen our planet and not the others in our solar system. The remake doesn't explore this to any extent and only gives the explanation that they placed machines under ground before humans inhabited the Earth, and when the time was right they arrived in bolts of lightning and started to claim the Earth for their own. There is no real explanation as to where they came from and why. It doesn't concentrate on the threat, it becomes second hand to what is happening with Tom Cruise's family.War of the Worlds, as with numerous Spielberg films, it is divided into two halves. It is similar to A.I. in the sense the first half is quite bright and sets up the film, while the second half is dark and focuses on the threats and a lot of the dangers that the family has to face, as with Haley Joel Osment's character in A.I.This is bit of a disappointment as the movie seems to be aimed more at the popcorn crowd and it doesn't do the original justice which is a shame because Spielberg is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, storyteller of our time and has brought us some the greatest films ever. It's not a bad film as it is well put together, it's just you're typical summer movie blockbuster. The film does have its moments but fans of the original might feel let down as that is one of the true great sci-fi classics and will stand the test of time and be remembered for a long time. Unfortunately, this one won't be and will not be remembered as one of Speilbergs greatest efforts either.",6,0,2,1 July 2005
Jaws," One big fish, one big cast, one MASSIVE movie!
","Even though the shark may be fake looking, Mr. Director, the almighty Steven Speilberg, used that to his advantage and left it unseen for the best part of the film. With an opening scene (the now legendary 'First Attack') that rides high up in the ranks alongside the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Speilberg, like the monster Great White in the movie, has proved himself a powerful force to be reckoned with. Apart from spawning three sequels (number two was okay, three and four, well lets not get into that shall we) Jaws is the ultimate monster movie which would only have its' perfect veneer tarnished if someone was to do a remake (Gus Van Sant's Psycho anyone?). The basic plot is that Satan's goldfish is snacking on the locals of Amity Island and it could cause a few problems as it is getting very close to the summer season and the tourists will be flocking in their droves to the island. It then comes down to three guys, Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider),  Icthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a Captain Ahab style shark fisherman called Quint (Robert Shaw) to try to kill the beast. Speilberg uses the camera alongside John Williams' simple but classic haunting score to show the power of the Great White with exhilerating effect. While Quint's monologue of the events of what happened to the crew on the Indianapolis had audiences mesmerised, a couple of well positioned jolts in the movie had people leaping out of their seats with fear, Jaws has created what we have come to expect every year and that's the summer blockbuster. We only have Mr. Speilberg to thank for giving us this now annual event.",9,1,3,30 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best one of the new trilogy, but still not a patch on the originals
","This is one movie that a lot of people have been waiting for for a long time, mainly because we get to see Anakin Skywalker become Darth Vader. In this final episode of the new trilogy we find out that Padme is pregnant but Anakin has been having nightmares that she will die giving birth. Anakin finds out that there might be a way to save her from this possible fate. Emperor Palptaine has been discovered to be the last of the Sith Lords and has been learning the dark side of the Force which has given him greater powers than the Jedi. As Palpatine and Anakin have become close friends, Palpatine takes Skywalker under his wing and turns him to the dark side and into Darth Vader.Visually the film looks great but again relies too much on CGI effects. The characters aren't worth caring about generally because there is no three dimensional aspect given to them. This is supposedly due to the fact that George Lucas is a technical director which is a shame given there is some talent involved with Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson. The fight scenes are well choreographed but again this only on a technical level. Those who were brought up on the trilogy and the die hard fans might however find a few minor inconsistencies between this episode and A New Hope.Overall not a bad effort but could've been so much better. Stick to the original trilogy as they are worthy cinematic classics.",5,1,2,12 June 2005
The Matrix," The Matrix has you and there is no escape.
","After success with the low budget movie Bound, the Wachowski brothers followed up with this behemoth of a movie. Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss, The Matrix is a sci-fi blockbuster of monstrous proportions.What if you wasn't in control of your life and that fate has things planned out for you? But what if you didn't believe in fate and that you don't like the idea that you are not in control of your life? This is the dilemma for computer programmer and hacker Thomas A. Anderson/Neo (Reeves). It seems that there is more going on than it seems as Neo has been looking for answers to a question that has been rattling around inside his noggin for quite some time. He is contacted by a man calling himself Morpheus (Fishburne) who claims to have the answers. Why are mysterious government type men in shades and suits chasing him? Does he know things that these men don't? And what the hell is the Matrix?
As the film boasted a 'What is the Matrix?' tagline, it would be all too easy to give away the big revelation as there are still people out there who have still yet to see the film. However, it can be said that that this movie does make you question a lot of things about reality, our future as to where we really are going in terms of the advancing wonders (if you can call it a wonder) of technology.Obviously filmed with a mega sized budget, Andy and Larry (Wachowski) have used every last penny to great effect using (at the time) up to date special effects that had never been seen before. They've also got their heads screwed on by not letting the effects overshadow the narrative which can so obviously ruin a film.Another thing that makes The Matrix such an amazing film is the action and fight sequences. In this day and age, musclebound heroics of the '80's are out of the window and a new slimline look is needed. It has set the benchmark for the new millenium for sci-fi/action, as what Die Hard did for the action movie in the late '80's. The martial arts sequences are given an eastern style and gun battles are brought to us in superb slow motion making it more in-your-face.One thing that also helps the movie along is the actors ability to pull off such an elaborate script. Okay, so Keanu Reeves maybe not be the best actor in the world but give credit where credit's due, he pulls his character off enough to make it believable. Laurence Fishburne is superb as Morpheus and the rest of the cast carry off their characters with style.
Unfortunately there is a down side to all of this and that it has to end at some point but that doesn't stop a repeat viewing or ten. Some people might find that the movie is a bit too intelligent at times for their liking but hell, beggars can't be choosers. The Matrix has to be seen at least twice to get the general plot as there is a lot to take in. Some might even get it it after just the initial viewing but there is so much going on that more than one viewing is essential.Overall, The Matrix is a superb movie that taxes the grey matter to its' limits without overloading it and assaults the senses with style.",10,0,1,14 August 2002
Donnie Darko," Is it the end of the universe or of the tangent universe?
","The world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. Our trip into the strange world of Donnie Darko begins with the title character (played brilliantly by Jake Gyllenhall) waking up in the middle of the road, on top of a mountain. Great start huh, but oh boy does it get better. Due to the fact that the troubled Donnie sees a shrink on a regular basis, sleepwalks and is visited by a 6 foot evil looking bunny rabbit telling him that the world will end doesn't always make for your ideal viewing experience. Once watched though, never forgotten.Director Richard Kelly has created a modern masterpiece with his debut picture. The science fiction of the story is given credibility and the possibilities of the structure of time and the universe are all brought together very well. Some people might find this film hard to understand or difficult to follow but when you actually think about whats going on and what's being said it's not all that difficult. It just takes more than one viewing to get everything but it will hopefully make you question a lot of things and keep you awake for hours pondering life, the existence of God and if life is predecided.This is one film that has rightly deserved its cult status.",10,0,2,4 February 2005
