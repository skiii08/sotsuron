Gremlins," Entertaining mess
","'Gremlins' is one of the wildest, most incoherent films ever to become a hit, but the style that sometimes makes the movie difficult to follow fits the subject--we in the audience literally don't know what to expect once the title gremlins are spawned and get loose (as we know they will). The beginning of the film cleverly sets up a super-bland Typical American Town out of Frank Capra; we get to know the local eccentrics (Hopeless Inventor, Spunky Housewife, Dense Sheriff, Miserable Old Rich Bitch) and the generic teenage dreamer Billy, who is presented on his birthday with Gizmo, an ultra-cute Furby-like creature who communicates in monosyllabic squeaks. Gizmo has a dark side, though; he accidentally spawns a breed of evil lizard-like monsters who invade the town on Christmas Eve and subject it to a destructive jamboree, like a miniature street gang on a sugar high. They're cartoon characters run wild--the movie shows how nightmarish it would be if animated cartoons turned evil and invaded the real world. Classic sequences abound; Billy's mother (Frances Lee McCain) battling the demons in her kitchen with the aid of a blender and a microwave; town harpy Mrs. Deagle (Polly Holliday) getting hers via a malfunctioning stair climber; Phoebe Cates' anti-Santa speech (I wonder if actresses ever used that monologue in auditions?) and a climactic battle scene set in a movie theatre playing 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.' The movie gives the impression of a brainstorm, or a jazz session--not all of the ideas work, but there's so much going on it is impossible to be bored for a second.",8,2,4,25 March 2012
The Hunger Games," Left me a little hungry
","Suzanne Collins' bestselling young-adult novel is given a competent yet disappointing film adaptation, but that hardly matters; the film is a conversation piece to put alongside the book, and as such it serves its purpose. What has happened here is that the director and the scenarists have approached the book so literally--in the fear that stylishness or imagination might repel teenage fans--that the result has the reverential tone of the first two Chris Columbus-directed Harry Potter movies. This also means that the book's main flaw is duplicated in the movie; namely, that the intriguing setup is more compelling than the games themselves.The first, briefly sketched scenes are good and tense and build up a suitable sense of dread; the reaping scene, with families lining up silently in an open field as if they were attending Shirley Jackson's lottery (in a sense, they are); the sudden arrival of manic Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), who looks like an airport gift-shop doll painted by someone on LSD; the initial scenes in the Capitol with its prancing, primping residents who could be extras from 'Alice in Wonderland' wandering through the 'Logan's Run' sets. Jennifer Lawrence grounds these sequences; her sculpted face, which can turn steely or vulnerable at will, seems to have everything extra burned out of it except the sheer will to survive. Once the games begin, though, the blood drains out (in more ways than one.) The shaky-cam is a disastrous choice; we're all used to it by now, and it's all too transparent as a way to camouflage the underage violence. If the first shot of the tributes leaving their posts were shot smoothly at some distance, the contrast between the pastoral setting and the animalistic battles would be truly terrifying. As it is, the filmmakers have shown so little interest in the other tributes that we barely react when the camera drifts over the bodies of those lost in that first deadly rush. Are Ross and company afraid that if they gave the other players 'too much' personality we'd stop sympathizing with Katniss when she fights them? They needn't have bothered, because the author has let her heroine out of any truly challenging moral decisions. She only kills in self-defense, or when someone is attacking a 'good' character. When she teams up with spritely little Rue (Amanda Stenberg), we're meant to feel torn, but then Rue is murdered by another tribute, whom Katniss then shoots dead. The scene is affecting (without pushing it) but we can't help noticing that now Katniss won't have to face the question of when (or whether) to kill Rue. What would have happened if Rue, Katniss, and Peeta had ended up in the final three? Structurally, the movie is thuddingly obvious; we know damned well Peeta and Katniss will survive to the end (so there can be a big 'conflicted' last scene). And we periodically waste time with scenes of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) loitering lovingly over his perfect rose garden as he drops bits of totalitarian wisdom to a reluctant subordinate (Wes Bentley); these serve no purpose except to be 'sinister', and Sutherland has reached the point where he can't be anything else. (The film stops just short of giving him a white cat to stroke.) There is one genuine accomplishment, however--Jennifer Lawrence spends nearly the whole movie running through the forest from her would-be killers--and she never once trips and falls full-length. As far as I know, that's a movie first.",5,4,8,6 April 2012
Face_Off," An 'art' movie in the worst sense
","'Face Off' has an irresistible premise, a marvelous cast, a painstaking director with a distinctive, risky style, and nonstop action. Yet I found it abominable.The ludicrous plot devices have been enumerated by many; they could be excused in a silly, trashy action movie in which a sense of parody is already built in. What happens here is some kind of first; John Woo's care and attention--his 'art', some would say--does nothing but point up the inauthenticity of every scene. There isn't a moment that rings true, or that rings false in an entertaining manner. Everyone is familiar by now with the mass-shootout scene in which the hero enters a villain's lair with a single machine gun, dispatches dozens of armed enemies, and emerges unscathed; it's become a new convention. Here, said scene is shot in slo-mo and underscored with a rapturous soprano version of 'Over the Rainbow'. Woo is saying (pretentiously) that there can be no real beauty in the world anymore; everything is tainted and corrupt. And he lingers so lovingly on the multi-angle shots of evil thugs' bodies being pulverized that we start to feel like Malcolm McDowell in 'Clockwork Orange', strapped to a chair with our eyes stapled open. We aren't entertained OR elevated, as Woo hopes; we're just being pushed around.The movie opens with what in most action films would be a finale; John Travolta's haunted police detective, whose son has been murdered by a sadistic sicko (Nicholas Cage), chases him down at an airport hangar. There are so many flying stunts, crashing stuntmen, and noise that the movie has nowhere to go (without blowing up the audience). Eventually the face-switching premise kicks in, and the movie makes its first REAL mistake--it introduces that force-of-nature actress CCH Pounder (whose voice and temperament are reminiscent of an African-American Colleen Dewhurst), and asks us to believe that she could be overpowered and murdered by Nicholas Cage!!!! She would crumple him into a Brillo pad and use him to do the windows! If the movie had let her survive and serve as Travolta's sidekick, we might have had something to ground us. Instead, we're stuck with a movie full of John Travolta acting like Nicholas Cage and Nicholas Cage acting like John Travolta (just what I always wanted for Christmas) and stuffed with Woo's trademark overdirected destruction orgies, which critics and action fans have dutifully lauded with all the usual adjectives--'dazzling', 'hyperkinetic', and, of course, 'balletic.' (ick is right). A climactic shootout in a church featuring heavily symbolic doves made me rather ill; this should have ended the movie, but we're thrown into yet another (by this time) yawn-inducing chase involving a powerboat. Can anyone guess the outcome? This may be the most exhausting movie ever made; it's all set pieces--it's like watching a musical with nothing but production numbers. Afterward, you just want to lie down and listen to elevator music for several days.",3,1,2,3 April 2012
Flashdance," Irresistible Trash
","I saw this movie as a child and knew it was terrible then, yet I couldn't take my eyes off it for a second. This is the rare movie that is so bad it is unforgettable; elements from it instantly entered the pop mythology of the 1980s. An entire generation (whether they saw the movie or not) became familiar with the welder-by-day/dancer-by-night conceit, the creative-bra-removal scene, the 'Maniac' running-in-place dance workout, and (of course) the interpretive dance involving gallons of water. Film critics may not have been enchanted, but you don't get such scenes in every movie.Every so often, a low-budget 'sleeper' movie comes out and becomes a runaway hit; generally, such movies are blue-collar musicals. They are about the ways in which struggling lower-class people use song and dance to break away from their squalid lives. (Examples--'Saturday Night Fever', 'Grease', 'Dirty Dancing', 'Full Monty', 'Billy Elliot'). This movie could be a parody of that genre, but it is played (and was taken) straight. A dewy-eyed female welder, Alex (whose hair, makeup, and wardrobe are always impeccable) finds artistic release at night through her performances in the oddest nightclub in movie history; the dancers thrash around and gyrate under strobe lights while never removing so much as a sock--yet the place stays in business despite competition from a 'real' strip club up the street (whose sleazy promoter keeps trying to poach away Alex and her friends). Yet Alex isn't fulfilled by this--she longs to study classical ballet and be taken 'seriously'. To that end, she keeps almost-applying to a local dance academy, urged on by an elderly former ballerina (Lilia Skala)--this unlikely friendship is actually one of the most likable and believable elements in the movie. It's less a movie than an extended rock video--everything is soaked in 1980s 'atmosphere' and scored to Giorgio Moroder hits. Strange, I know, but not all movie love is explicable.",8,2,5,25 March 2012
1941," Make up your own mind, okay?
","One of the funniest movies of all time. A gigantic screwball comedy that just keeps getting zanier and more outrageous as it goes--just when you think the comic invention is all used up, something else springs out of left field and surprises you. Don't listen to the snobby 'academic' critics--Pauline Kael, the greatest (and, for my money, the only) movie critic of all time gave this movie the praise it deserved. If the Marx Brothers had made a comedy about World War II, this would be it. Some of the performers--John Belushi, Treat Williams, and Wendie Jo Sperber, in particular--have never been better, and the USO chase sequence is GENIUS choreography. What's not to like?",10,0,5,28 May 2011
Mystic River," Most Overrated Movie of All Time
","This is one of the most dreadful, pretentious movies I have ever seen. I was shaking with anger as I walked home afterward. Eastwood has taken his lifelong 'you can't win', sour, nihilistic vision of life to ludicrous extremes in this contrived melodrama.To be fair, the novel by Dennis Lehane is hopelessly flawed to begin with. Lehane likes to use big themes (the Holocaust in 'Shutter Island', child molestation here) to give false importance to conventional, uninspired murder mysteries. This movie is NOT a serious examination of child molestation; it uses that horrific crime merely as an excuse to supply the story with a character (Dave) who can behave in wild, irrational ways and serve as an all-too-obvious suspect in the murder that takes place. Dave's actions have no psychological rationale; watch the scene where he's interrogated by the police (Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne) and he goes from hopelessly terrified to calculating in a few seconds, for no reason.Eastwood compounds this by shooting everything in a slooooow, gray, somber, humorless style. He's so busy making a 'statement' about how hopeless and unfair life is that he doesn't notice how unbelievable most of the devices are--like a a symbolic hulking teenager with an over-sized hockey stick, who would have been considered hokey in a silent movie. And I'm tired of hearing about all the 'great acting'. Eastwood sabotages his hardworking actors (especially Penn and Robbins) with sealed-off, overlong closeups (as if he were pre-selecting their Oscar clips). Poor Marcia Gay Harden, as Robbins' wife, is saddled with a scene where she has to walk, step-by-step, up a long staircase while staring 'in horror' at Robbins in the hall below--and LIGHTNING STRIKES OUTSIDE! (What is this, 'Dark Shadows'?) The best performances are the least acclaimed--Bacon and Fishburne's tough, unsentimental cops, and the great Laura Linney as Penn's wife (although even she is destroyed by a last minute, 180-degree turnaround Lady Macbeth scene which no one could pull off.) I suspect a lot of people feel the same way--this movie never really became a big hit, despite the overmarketing and Oscar hype. See a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical instead--it'll be a lot more believable.",1,2,5,10 January 2011
