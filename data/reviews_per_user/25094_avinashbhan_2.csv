The Avengers," Liked it!!
","Just came back from the screening of the Avengers and I liked it! One of the two things I was scared of is if the movie would give equal importance to all the characters(since this one has a lot of characters)meaning some characters get under played and others get more time on the screen but that never happened. The movie was well paced as well.Another thing that I was skeptical about is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, I was kind of hoping that Ed Norton would do the character but that did not happen. Never the less Mark did do a good job.So for me it was a 7.5 but I cannot give a 7.5 on rating so since the movie was good I gave it 8.You for sure can go and see the movie.",8,3,9,27 April 2012
The Dark Knight," The Best Super Hero MOVIE EVER!!!!! The BEST movie of the year 2008!!
","The Best Super Hero MOVIE EVER!!!!! The BEST movie of the year 2008!! Before I talk about the movie let me tell you about my perception of Batman till the time I saw Dark Knight I thought it would be the same old kid movie (the BOOM!!! BAM!!! PUFF!!! Like effects that we used to see earlier), but then some of my friends who had seen Batman Begins said that Dark Knight it should be good. So I saw the movie apart from the fact that it is a master piece the other thing that struck me was it was not that old style Batman that we were used to see when we were kids, but it was a Dark, serious and intense movie and secondly for the first time I wanted to see the prequel to a movie (which mind you never happened to me till date and I guess it rarely happens to any one) with such eagerness. And even Batman Begins was at par with its sequel.As far as the movie goes it a master piece and every one has done a fantastic job (even the support cast) , although the Batman is the hero but here Joker is real hero for the movie(You might realize that after you see the movie) I mean he is has outdone every one in terms of acting, character and dialog delivery!!!(WHY SO SERIOUS!!!!).I just realized today that Heath Ledger had passes away in Jan. of 2008 which makes me very sad, we have lost a good actor.... RIP Heath LedgerFOR ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN BATMAN BEGINS JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK IT WAS NOT WORTH IT. I SAY IT IS WORTH EVERY MINUTE YOU SIT AND WATCH THE MOVIE.AND AFTER YOU SEE BATMAN BEGINS I BET YOU CANT RESIST YOUR SELF FROM WATCHING DARK KNIGHT!!!!",10,7,15,22 August 2008
