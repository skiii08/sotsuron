The Avengers," The Avengers is okay, but not worth the hype.
","When i sat down to watch the Avengers i had little if not any hope that i would enjoy it. But i was wrong, what happened when the film started was a collection of events that changed my 'little hope' attitude into something much different. After the opening scene i was, to say the least, entertained. But, when i tasked myself with the painfully easy job of rating this film, all this film is...is entertainment. In a time of dazzling CGI and insanely fun action sequences, The Avengers lives up to the hype. But in a world of intriguing plot, immersing performances and emotional roller coaster rides, The Avengers is nothing but another Transformers movie. Let me elaborate. Fans of the Marvel Comics will love this movie, because it does what it says on the tin, it effectively brings the heroes (not all of them, but some) together in a fist fight with a destructive foe. To a Marvel fan, this is gold. To a 'film' fan, however, this movie is little more than a popcorn flick. People enjoying this movie is not my issue, i want people to enjoy movies, but when it comes to the rating systems on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes (etc) people have, wrongly, rated the Avengers near to the highest of all ratings. Films like the Godfather, ALIEN, Shane, Vertigo, Psycho, Blade Runner, Goodfellas, Jaws and many, many more films deserve the high rating because these are cinematic masterpieces. These are films which changed cinema, and have set the benchmark for all genres of today's films. But when i see The Avengers at the top of the ratings with them, it disgusts me. It should be rated fairly, on an accurate basis of how the film is crafted and the impact it makes, and for me it is a 4. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie. But, it is not a classic, nor by far a masterpiece, which renders most fans reviews redundant. People can love this movie, hell it can be there favorite movie of them all, but they need to understand it is nowhere near the Giants of cinema. Its not worth all the hype, but its fun. Its not a clever film (the themes have been done to death, and the twists are terrible) but its entertainment.So, i bid you farewell.",4,6,13,3 November 2013
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years A Slave...The Masterpiece
","'12 years a slave' was an amazing, gripping, and emotional drama, with a potent script and powerhouse performances from every single actor in the movie. It's horrifying how that actually happened, and the way it was brought to life by Steve McQueen was brutal and harsh, but had moments of beauty in it also. Certainly a film that will stand the test of time. A masterpiece? Most definitely, and if the film downs receive the best actor Oscar, best director Oscar and best supporting actor Oscar I will be hugely shocked. Even the soundtrack added beauty to the film, Hans Zimmer has done it yet again! I said about American Hustle that it would be hard for a film to beat that this year, but 12 years a slave just has, and I think it will be regarded as film of the year amongst many. Absolutely mesmerizing! I recommend it to everyone, it truly is an emotional journey. Worth every penny of the cinema ticket. WOW.",10,3,5,13 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," And here we have ANOTHER masterpiece from Scorsese
","The Wolf Of Wall Street...hmm...WOW! Not sure where to start, in fact no matter how much rambling I do there is no way to show how amazing this movie is without you seeing it for yourself at the cinema...it's just pure brilliance. It's witty and sometimes dark humor is matched evenly by its brutality and cinematic excellence, which makes for quite possibly one of the best movies you'll see. Martin Scorsese has, well, done it again! By all accounts this is amongst his top work. Leonardo DiCaprio is just incredible, a very engaging performance. It's safe to say he has nailed it, he definitely deserves the Oscar finally! Jonah Hill is the best I've ever seen him, and well so is everyone else. The script is solid and absolutely amazing, and so is the direction. I've seen three amazing films so far this year, American Hustle, 12 Years A Slave and this...and, I have to say...this film edges it to top spot out of all of them. Incredible. A must see!",10,1,6,20 January 2014
