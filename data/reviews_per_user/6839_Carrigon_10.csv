The Blair Witch Project," I was never so Bored in my life! (SPOILERS)
","This contains spoilers!I just rented this film and I feel like I wasted the money on it.  Maybe if I hadn't known it was a movie and had thought it was real, I might have gotten into it alittle more, but even then, it would still have bored me to tears.  All that happens is three people get lost in the woods, cry alot, say the F word after every single word and a few other four letter words just to add dialogue.  They find some laughable scarecrow stick figures in the woods, big deal.  One of them wanders off, big deal.  The remaining two cry some more and whine alot.  They find a pile of sticks with a weird bloody thing in it, a little strange, but not really scary.  They find a falling apart house, think they hear the missing guy calling to them.  They run all around the house with the camera, screaming alot.  Finally go in the basement and......nothing.  End of film.  Boring, boring, boring!  I can't even imagine a more boring film.  If you want to see three people yell at each other, whine and cry alot for over an hour, this is your film. Otherwise, don't even bother to pick this one up.  It's an overhyped piece of junk.  The only good thing about the film is the concept itself.  The idea of making a documentary (mockumentary) about the Blair Witch and that the film crew disappears was very good.  But the movie itself, sucked.  I'm sure people who copy the concept will do a much better job of actually scaring us.",Null,0,0,26 October 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Nice costumes and sets, so-so plot
","Well, I liked the costumes and the sets.  You could tell they spent alot of money making this movie.  The skeletons were fun.  But as far as the plot goes, half the time it just felt like this confusing mess.  And while I loved how Jonny Depp looked in this film, I didn't like the way his character was written.  I felt like I was watching Richard Simmons in a pirate costume!  I think I would have liked this movie better had it been more of a horror film instead of an adventure movie.  I think it would have worked scary.  I would have liked Depp's character to have been tougher.  I guess this movie is okay if you like pirate films, but it just wasn't what I wanted.  I would love to see it redone with alot of horror, but I know I'm dreaming.  So, see it for the costumes, but don't expect it to be a great film.",4,2,5,20 July 2003
The Mummy," Great Fun Adventure!
","I really liked this movie.  It managed to keep me entertained throughout, which is a very hard task lately.  I was never bored.  I liked all the action scenes and the special effects.  The only drawback is that the movie could have used alittle more character development.  I really would have liked to have known more about some of the characters.  But other than that, it was a great movie with good acting, fun locations, and very good effects. I'd give it about an 8 or 9 on a scale of one to ten.  If it had the characterization it was missing, I would have given it the full ten.  This movie is worth seeing.",Null,0,0,17 October 1999
Spider-Man 3," Sadman: The Movie
","SPOILERS in POST: This movie was so depressing. Everyone was crying in just about every other scene. Everyone was miserable. Spiderman/Peter spent most of the movie either being a selfish, self-centered, egotistical jerk, or he was moping around miserable that MJ wasn't returning his calls. And MJ spent the entire movie feeling sorry for herself since she got kicked out of the play and now has to work in a small jazz club. She should be glad she even got another job that fast. Most people can't.They killed off all the good characters. Harry was the only really likable character in the movie. And Venom got less screen time and story than the engagement ring. The ring got tons of story and airtime.There were some really bad scenes in this movie. Just plain bad writing. Like right in the middle of the film, it suddenly turns into Saturday Night Fever 2007 as Peter does a poor imitation of John Travolta's strut down the street. And the Sandman scenes were just horrible. Why are we suddenly supposed to feel sorry for this guy? He's a villain. I don't want to care about him, I want him squashed.But the saddest part of all was that by the time the final fight scene comes in, Peter/Spiderman is so deserving of a beatdown that you are actually rooting for the bad guys as they pound the stuffing out of him.Bad writing all around. It's not an entirely unwatchable movie, but it's not a happy movie, and it doesn't really leave you feeling like you'd want to see it again or really want a part four. You're kind of relieved it's over.Maybe they should use all that money they're making off the film to give these characters some Prozac and good Counseling.",4,4,7,6 May 2007
The Thing," Almost 20 Years Later And This Is Still One Of The Best!
","I can't believe it's been almost 20 years since I first saw this movie.  The Thing is truly one of the best horror films I have ever seen.  You are truly scared.  I have wanted a good sequel to this film for a long time.  But it's such a classic it really doesn't need one.  The ending is so perfect.  My only gripe about the film is that it was an all male cast, not one single female.  Other than that, the movie is perfect, classic horror.  Truly one of John Carpenter's best ever.",10,0,1,30 November 1999
Cold Mountain," Most Depressing Movie of the Year
","This was probably the most depressing movie I've seen in years.  I don't understand how anyone can actually like this film.  It's all dark and everyone's getting killed or tortured.  And not to spoil the ending, but it's so depressingly awful.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's not even a tearjerker in a good way, it's just plain depressing.  If you like Civil War movies, there are better ones out there, and there are plenty of better love stories out there that actually have happy endings, unlike this awful film.  I've seen horror movies with happier endings than this!",1,11,22,5 January 2004
Resident Evil," Almost as Good as the Game!
","I really liked this movie.  I'm usually a horror movie snob and hate anything new.  But this one was very good.  Milla was great, I would love to see her in more roles like this one.  I thought the script stayed very true to alot of the gameplot.  And the movie definitely had some creepy moments. I was very sorry they didn't show more of the mansion, I would have loved to have seen more of it.  It's an amazing property.  And while the makeup wasn't like Tom Savini's work, it was still very good.  When I heard Romero wasn't going to be doing this project, I really was prepared to hate it, but I think Paul Anderson did a wonderful job on it.  And he set up the ending very well for the sequel, which I think will be even better.  If you're a fan of the games, this movie is worth watching.  I was never bored, it kept up a nice pace.",8,0,0,25 May 2002
28 Days Later...," The Film that makes you go, 'huh???'
","I watched this weird movie today. It's one of those movies that just makes you go 'huh?'. It's not a great horror movie and it's not a great psychological thriller. You just sit there going, 'what is it?'. This movie had the potential to be great. The fast moving 'infected' are really scary, but you see them so seldom in the film. It needed tons of them. The only reason I was freaked out was because the main characters don't have any guns and don't seem interested in getting any. I would think, since you're trapped in a city infested with rabid zombies, that you might possibly want a better weapon than a baseball bat and large knife?? And you might not want to be walking around out in the open. Like why not stick a sign on your butt 'dinner here!'. This movie seemed to want to be a horror film, but it just didn't quite make it. And the main characters just weren't that sympathetic. Like I had a hard time caring about them at all. Toward the end of the film, things get a bit violent and freaky but not enough really. Or it's just too little too late. Then the ending itself was really lame. About the only thing I thought was really good was that they did a great job of making England look deserted. It's hard for me to recommend this film. The only really scary thing was the no gun thing. And walking around out in the open with no real weapon. I wouldn't give this film a really low rating, but I wouldn't give it a high one either. Somewhere in between.  It's a shame, really.  The potential was there.  The beginning idea was great.  Animal activists try to rescue some chimps and end up getting bitten and infected with a rabid zombie virus that takes over most of the world.  And we're given the story of a small handful of survivors.  But it just wasn't what it should have been.  Too little zombie stuff.  And somehow, alot of the film was boring.",Null,0,0,30 June 2003
I Am Legend," Stinks Worse Than My Cat's Litter Box
","This movie is so bad, I don't even know where to begin. It has a boring beginning. There is nothing scary or campy or much of anything. It's just boring. They barely show us any infected at all. And the lack of a soundtrack only makes it that much worse. The script is horrible, the direction is just as bad. And it makes Will Smith look like a weak lead. They botched this story so badly that it doesn't even deserve the I am Legend title. We don't get vampires, and what we do get really sux. What little we get to see of them, that is. I will be amazed if people don't walk out of the theaters all over the world on this movie. Stick to Last Man on Earth and Omega Man, you'll be much happier for it. This movie is a turd.",1,11,22,15 December 2007
The Descent," LionsGate Delivers
","One of the best horror films I've seen in a very long time. I had almost given up on the genre completely. The Descent proves there are still great horror stories to be told.This movie works on a lot of levels. The story is pretty realistic and it takes you through a group of friends out for an afternoon of cave exploration. One of the cave tunnels collapses, trapping them and they are forced to go deeper, much farther down. And then they discover they are being hunted by creatures that live down there.The movie takes some time at the beginning to develop the women's characters, some might feel it's too slow at the beginning, but I felt it added realism. I liked all the scenes of rock climbing in the caves, everything felt real. And the creatures were believable to a degree because they were based more on nature's odd developments.It's a great horror movie. Don't skip this one, it's really worth seeing.",10,3,7,24 July 2006
