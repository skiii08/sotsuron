Minority Report," I See Potential Dead People
","Reportedly, at some stage of its life, 'Minority Report', based on a Philip K. Dick short story of the same name, was being developed by Paul Verhoeven as 'Total Recall 2', which would connect the pre-cogs of 'Report' with the psychic Martian mutants of 'Recall'.  Spielberg's is a better movie than that one would have been, but still fails to be quite as good as its potential.It's 2054, and the notoriously lawless District of Columbia has become a tranquil place, largely through the efforts of the Precrime Division of the D.C. Metropolitan Police (which, to judge from the sleek Precrime HQ, got a major funding increase at some point).  The cops of Precrime, led by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise),  intervene in murders before they happen. They can do this courtesy of the pre-cogs, a trio of clairvoyant savants who spend their days sedated in a pool of nutri-muck, receiving images of future violent deaths, along with the names of the victims and perpetrators (the pre-cogs are named, in a cute but obvious touch, Arthur, Dashiell, and Agatha).  The cops analyze the images to determine where the killing will happen, then zip to the scene in a hovercraft that looks like a cross between Boba Fett's Slave-1 and a malevolent seashell, nabbing the killer before the victim's blood is shed.  The offender is then locked up (there's no trial; after all, the pre-cogs are never wrong) in a suspended-animation prison.Precrime has been such a success that there is interest in expanding it nationwide (how they will do this with only three pre-cogs is never clear), and Anderton and his mentor (Max Von Sydow) are visited by an unctuous federal agent (a creepy but charismatic Colin Farrell) who is examining the Precrime program for flaws that might compromise public trust.  And soon, Anderton has serious problems of his own: the pre-cogs finger him, for the murder of a man he has never met.  He makes a run for it, trying to dodge his colleagues and find out what's going on.  Someone has set him up and he doesn't know why, but it may have to do with an old Precrime case that keeps turning up like a bad penny.Visually, the movie is stunning. Spielberg fills his future world with fascinating stuff, alternately awe-inspiring and unsettling: roads are choked with aerodynamic cars that drive up the sides of buildings. Passive retinal scanners in public places identify you as you walk by, generating slick commercials that call out to you by name (public ID checkers and their effects on fugitives also cropped up in last spring's 'Impostor', itself based on a Dick story), while a shopping center's walls teem with ghostly animated ads.  In another memorable sequence, the residents of a government housing block stop whatever they are doing to submit to the attentions of 'spiders', tiny self-guiding retinal scanners on spindly legs, which almost become characters in their own right (one, for instance, seems to be a bit smarter than the others).Unfortunately, Spielberg is unable to contain his puckishness, and the action scenes are staged with a liberal dose of slapstick humor.  It's nice that Spielberg doesn't take himself too seriously (there was a whiff of that in 'A.I.') but it doesn't fit with the solemn tone of the proceedings. It's as if Tom Hanks had, in the midst of 'Saving Private Ryan', pulled out a bullwhip and hitched a ride on a Wehrmacht truck.  'Minority Report' raises a lot of heavy Orwellian questions, but it's far more eager to play than think.Tom Cruise is probably the only Hollywood leading man to get this far in his career without ever playing a cop.  It's sort of strange: with his clean-cut, chiseled features and clipped line deliveries, he's a natural for it.  He plays Anderton with believable, brisk competence, and he looks appropriately like the Brave Man of the Shiny New Future, but we don't really get from Cruise the inner turmoil that others describe in Anderton. When he has a moment of unhinged emotion, we sort of wonder where it came from.  It would have been interesting to see what someone like Ed Harris would have done with this role.Anderton grabs a pre-cog (the female, natch) to help him find the truth. Samantha Morton's Agatha is a haunting and delicate presence as that sci-fi staple, the innocent with great power (the religious overtones of the pre-cogs are hinted at repeatedly, especially in the funny reaction of a sleazy virtual-memory dealer upon meeting Agatha).  When Morton gives voice to her visions, and pleads fruitlessly not to see them fulfilled, we have the sense of someone with an awesome and terrible gift.  Still, I think it's safe to say that Sinead O'Connor has pretty much killed the buzz-cut look for women.Other bright spots in the cast: Tim Blake Nelson has a quirky turn as Gideon, the warden and sole staff member of the coma-prison (itself an oddly beautiful Kubrickian creation).  And the always welcome Lois Smith scores as the reclusive doctor responsible for the pre-cogs, though her scene degenerates into pointless weirdness.The story is well-paced and interestingly twisty, but it sacrifices more and more credibility as it goes.  'Minority Report' is almost, but not quite, good enough to coast smoothly over its logical potholes.  It's smart, but not quite as smart as it pretends.  Philosophically, it sets up an extreme position and then argues against it.  Sure, locking people up without trial for things they haven't actually done (yet) is a Bad Thing, but the movie inadvertently sabotages its point with a montage of living, breathing victims who would otherwise have been raped, shot, and slaughtered.  It's shown in passing, but it sticks with you.The movie's good, but it's good when it could have been phenomenal, and that's bad.",8,0,0,21 August 2002
Underworld," A-Vamping We Will Go
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but a good while ago, vampires stopped being hideous corpse-rats and aloof Mitteleuropean aristocrats with funny accents.  In many cases, they even stopped being bad guys.  Your average vampire these days is slick, sexy, and angst-ridden, living an eternal Gothic bacchanal.  What, precisely, is so inherently sexy about a reanimated corpse has always escaped me.  I blame Anne Rice.  Or maybe that Keifer Sutherland movie.  Anyway, that particular strain of vampire fiction has always impressed me very little; nothing wearies my patience quite like some pretentious navel- gazing twit done up in black, pausing to murder a cute starlet before whining about the dreariness of existence.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody hand me a wooden stake.That said, I have to admit that `Underworld' is a pretty decent movie.  It treats its vampires vs. werewolves war scenario with a trifle too much seriousness, and borrows heavily from other movies in its visual vocabulary, but it throws enough talent at the problem on both sides of the camera that it pulls through. Besides, it can't help but be better than the leaden, preening `Interview With the Vampire'.Our bloodsucking heroine is Selene (Kate Beckinsale, very fetching in a patent- leather bodysuit), who is a `Deathdealer', one of the leather-trenchcoated button men of the vampire world.  The Vamps, we learn, have been duking it out for centuries with the Lycans (a fancy name for your garden-variety werewolf). Throughout, the human race has been oblivious to the fighting, which apparently means ignoring a couple of gory firefights a week.  The exact casus belli here is unclear for much of the movie, and even the characters don't really know since, as Selene tells us, researching history is forbidden.  Boy, that's never a good sign.  The war is as much a conflict of dueling fashion sense as anything else: the Vampires are sleek dilettantes who loll around on vintage furniture in grandiose mansions, sipping blood from crystal goblets and exchanging sardonic smirks, while the Lycans are hairy and unkempt rowdies who live in the sewer and amuse themselves by beating the snot out of each other.  The Vamps dress in fancy evening gowns and tailored leather; the Lycans' idea of high fashion is an old Bundeswehr jacket and no shirt. The Vampires have guns with lots of polished chrome compensators and electronic doodads stuck all over them (they do target practice on Renaissance busts); the Lycans are fond of AKs and oversized Desert Eagles.  Interestingly, the Lycans all appear to be male.  Can't imagine why. Anyway, while out snuffing a couple of Lycans, Selene notices that they seem to be following Michael (Scott Speedman), a medical intern at a local hospital, and also discovers that the sneaky wolves have developed special vampire-piercing bullets made with irradiated liquid sunshine.  She decides to check into Michael more closely, over the opposition of her vampire colleagues, and discovers not only the roots of the war, but also that everything she has believed all of her undead life is, er, inaccurate.The movie is set in a Stygian and rainy City With No Name, located somewhere in eastern Europe (`Underworld' was shot in Budapest and Prague). DirectorLen Wiseman films the place with a lot of gray filter and shadow, which gives all the characters the wan, ashen appearance of the walking dead.  The atmosphere is a definite plus for the movie, though it's hardly original. If vampires were real, this is where they'd live - they wouldn't stand out for not having a tan. Kate Beckinsale gives a subtle and effective performance as Selene, though I'm not sure if it is the one intended.  She seems to be written as a steely warrior, but Beckinsale comes off too delicate and waifish for that.  Frequently in her combat scenes, she looks disconcerted, uncomfortable, and a little scared.  She's competent but not confident, and seems like something of a shyly charismatic tomboy who's a vampire but isn't really into it.  When she walks through the grand hall of the vampire hangout, the in-crowd vampires just stare at her with what might be disdain, and she doesn't give them the time of day (well, night I guess).  Selene is, essentially, an orphan a couple of times over, and Beckinsale's performance gives a definite sense of the vulnerability this entails. Frankly, I thought all this made her a more interesting and appealing character, whose courage comes from control of fear, not absence of it, but I'm not sure it's what the creators had in mind.  And you do sort of keep expecting other characters to put their arms around her and say, `There, there, Sweetie, werewolves aren't really real, they're just make-believe.' Wiseman selected quite a good cast for the movie, even in small roles, and this helps immensely in making `Underworld' entertaining.  Speedman is fine in his secondary role, though he and Beckinsale's inevitable romantic bonding is a little unconvincing.  As the Lycan boss, Michael Sheen creates a compelling portrait of ferocity that becomes oddly sympathetic, particularly when his grievance against the vampires is given an airing.  The only weak spot in the cast is Shane Brolly, who plays the cowardly but devious vampire chieftain Kraven (the legendary vampire warrior-king he is playing Prince John for is called `Viktor'.  Such is `Underworld's idea of symbolism).  The fact that Kraven is something of a sissified drama king does not excuse Brolly's hyperventilating all his lines like he's climbing Everest or something.  Viktor, incidentally, is revived as a desiccated mummy in the course of the story, and Bill Nighy plays him with eerie, amoral dignity even through many layers of prosthetics.The ending leaves room for a sequel, as is increasingly common among action movies, all of whom have decided to at least leave the option of creating a franchise.  I mean, pretty much everything gets a sequel these days.  And you could do worse, I guess.  After all, how many books did Anne Rice write?",7,1,2,7 November 2003
We Were Soldiers," Choppering into the Little Big Horn
","If LtCol Harold Moore did not actually exist, it would be necessary for Hollywood to invent him.  A tough-talking, straightforward leader of men, equal parts swagger and heart, he loves his troops like his own children, refuses to leave the combat zone while his boys are in the sharp end, and sheds tears for the fallen in between barking orders into a radio handset and shooting charging enemies through the head.  The crazy thing about Moore, and about 'We Were Soldiers' in general, is not how much is Hollywood hokum, but how much seems to be but isn't.  Moore is a real person and he was by all accounts (including, but not limited to, his own) a tough soldier, a shrewd commander, and the kind of crazy SOB who would be the first to go in and the last to leave.'We Were Soldiers' is the story of Moore and his 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry (Custer's old unit) in the Ia Drang valley, the first major confrontation between American and Vietnamese troops.  This alternately brilliant and exasperating movie is based on a book by Moore and UPI reporter Joe Galloway, with the cumbersome but oddly poetic title 'We Were Soldiers Once...and Young'.  It begins with Moore's assignment to the Army's first dedicated air cavalry unit, which is among the first US combat troops sent to Vietnam.  What starts as a mission to destroy an enemy force that attacked an American base becomes a brutal siege as the Cav are surrounded and trapped, 395 men pitted against nearly two thousand of the enemy.Moore is played by Mel Gibson, who adeptly portrays both the paternal kindness of a decent man and the manic glint so common in good infantry officers.  Unfortunately, the movie focuses so much on him that it loses some of its big-picture scope.  After a while it begins to seem that Gibson is everywhere; no firefight can commence unless he fires the opening volley, no act of valor passes without a shot of Gibson's eyes welling up with pained pride at the sacrifice of his soldiers.  A little of this is good, too much of it is bad.  Moore probably was larger than life, but Gibson's Moore almost threatens to be larger than the movie.The supporting cast is led by Sam Elliott, whose Sergeant Major Plumley is destined to take his place among the greatest flinty NCO portrayals in film history.  Barry Pepper plays Galloway, and delivers the movie's intro and epilogue, though he doesn't appear until late in the movie.  The movie parallels the story of the battle with that of the officers' wives, led by Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore.  The wives' story is given some short shrift (and some very clumsy scenes), though it is in parts so wrenching it is almost a relief to return to the war zone.One memorable passage in Moore's book likens the sound of a bullet hitting flesh to that of a canoe paddle slapping wet mud, an image that is at once comical and horrifying.  We have come to expect graphic carnage from our war movies these days.  However, instead of the rapid-fire speed-lapse photography seen in 'Saving Private Ryan's' unforgettable Normandy sequence, writer/director Randall Wallace offers more straightforward depictions of the businesslike horrors of close combat: he doesn't use a lot of camera tricks to communicate the concept of chaotic violence, he just fills the screen with chaotic violence and lets us watch it in its unflinching fury. And call me an air-show junkie, but he has some beautiful sequences of Hueys diving over hilltops, flying in through smoke, etc.Most latter-day war movies give a nod to the enemy, making him human, not a faceless monster.  For all this movie's flag-waving sentimentality, it's actually better in this regard than most.  The Vietnamese are not fearless stoics; we see a young NVA infantryman panting and wide-eyed with fear as he charges the equally afraid Americans (something even anti-American screeds like 'Platoon' never showed).  It's also instructive to watch Moore and his opposite number (Don Duong) moving among their troops doing similar things: offering encouragement, making stirring speeches, and plotting the demise of the other.This is a battle picture, a movie that exhaustively analyzes a single big-picture event in a war.  While movies of this type have been made for years, this is one of the very few to come out of Vietnam.  The pantheon of great (and not-so-great) Vietnam movies all have one thing in common: they portray specific events that did not, strictly speaking, actually take place.  Those movies are more about Vietnam as a general phenomenon than about anything that quantifiably happened there.  In this way, 'We Were Soldiers' represents something quite daring: Wallace has made an early-40s WWII movie about the Vietnam War.And that's part of the problem: the movie has far too many places where it goes for overblown sentiment and emotional manipulation, often hokey to the point of embarrassment.  The fact that many of the cliches are true and many of the corny Hollywood moments are based in fact does not excuse slathering them in high melodrama.  This is doubly a shame because these scenes overshadow some stunning moments that work better for being small: none of the shots of Moore's eyes misting at the loss of his men can match the power of a scene that shows him standing by himself, his back to the camera as his shoulders shake with his unseen sobs.  This is a good movie, but it misses its chance to be a great movie because it doesn't trust us in the folding seats to adequately grasp the point.When 'We Were Soldiers' goes wrong, it makes you want to roll your eyes. But when it gets it right, it cuts straight through to you with a sound like a canoe paddle slapping wet mud.",7,5,9,3 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," There is (Still) No Spoon
","Here is wisdom:  Everything that has a beginning has an end.  A long, plodding, painfully drawn-out end.  Here is more wisdom: Some things are better left to the imagination.  There is no spoon.The Matrix trilogy limps to an less-than-satisfying conclusion in The Matrix Revolutions, which makes a lot of the same mistakes that made Reloaded such a disappointment.  How did this happen?  The first movie was so cool, so exhilarating.  It nodded politely to all its blended sources, before pouring them all together and creating its own intriguing story, with layers of reality stacked helter-skelter.  It created a sensation, defined moviemaking for a generation, and inspired musings by fans ranging from obscure ramblings on websites (um, hi there) to doctoral theses.  Forget The Phantom Menace - The Matrix was the real successor to Star Wars. And that, I think, is the problem. The Matrix series has become so intent on itself as post-modern myth that it forgets to be fun.  Both sequels ratcheted up the mumbo-jumbo while discarding the endearingly loopy pseudo-religiosity that gave the first movie its charm. They increase complexity and reduce joy.  There is no reason whatsoever why the sequels should turn out to be more talky than the first one, which had to set up the whole scenario in the first place, but that's exactly what happened.I won't bother too much with plot summary, especially since it's so convoluted and strange, expanding on the revelations in Reloaded about the nature and history of the Matrix.  Anyway, the Bad Guys are still on their way to trash Zion, and Agent Smith is still replicating like a crazed Xerox machine in a bid to take over the Matrix.Revolutions, like Reloaded, errs in setting comparatively little action inside the Matrix itself.  The Matrix, and the heroes' ability to distort its reality to their advantage, was the element that made the original stand out, and gave it the wow factor that made it a modern classic.  It's the series' best card, but they seem reluctant to play it.  It was far more dramatically effective to dream of Zion than to see it, and that was before we knew that it looked like some kind of industrial-park hippie commune.  There is too much of Zion in Revolutions, too much of its unwashed squalor, its strange caveman fetish, and the stuffy school board that runs it (including Cornel West, whose acting skills suggest he should stick to extorting money from Harvard, or Princeton, or whatever school he's milking now).But Reloaded gave us a nifty car-chase set piece to partially redeem itself for being so dull and earnest.  Revolutions instead gives us a slug-match at the rusty gates of Zion between invading robo-squids and the goofily impractical weaponry of Zion's defense forces.  I need to talk about these for a sec - they have these giant robot frames with machine guns in each hand, but with no targeting system or any kind of shielding for the operator.  Who designed these things?  Undertakers?  The fight scene itself is big and loud, and not without visual dazzle, but it's nothing you haven't already seen, and better.  The in- Matrix theatrics are limited to a floor-to-ceiling shootout in the basement of a nightclub, and the final fistfight showdown between Neo and Agent Smith. They are amazing scenes of technical artistry, but then they're over.The Matrix series provided the perfect vehicle for Keanu Reeves, who is, to put it kindly, not a deep actor.  Reeves has made the most of his spacey quality, and turns his flatness into an impressive sort of Zen charisma.  There's really no other actor who could have pulled it off as well.  And though she is more talented, he and Carrie-Anne Moss do have a certain quiet chemistry together. The real disappointment in Revolutions is Laurence Fishburne.  He was perfectly cast as the inscrutable master, communicating wisdom and self- possession, with just the right leavening of humor.  In Reloaded, he had that awful scene where he bellowed that weird speech on the rock in Zion -Morpheus should never have to raise his voice - but his freeway sword battle was thrilling.  By Revolutions Fishburne looks pudgy and spent, and doesn't get any good scenes.  It's as if Morpheus is so far past his prime that they only keep him around out of pity.There's still Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.  Weaving's unmistakable stilted line deliveries have become part of film lore, perfectly capturing the sense that something about the world was slightly. . .off, and one of the subtle signs that the machines' understanding of humanity was incomplete.  In Revolutions Smith is working solo, and becoming a threat to human and machine alike.  He has an entourage of clones, though the effect is more comic than chilling.Revolutions also sees the return of the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his chilly consort (Monica Bellucci).  I never understood these characters' purpose, and still don't.  Their presence in the second movie seemed like an unnecessary detour, but one imagined they were being introduced because they would become significant by series' end.  They don't - they actually get less screen time in the final chapter than the second.  This is probably just as well, since whenever they were on screen in Reloaded, it stopped the movie dead.The ending is obtuse, and leaves you going, `Well, NOW what?'  If the Wachowskis hadn't announced that the trilogy was ended, I would think they were leaving themselves open for a fourth movie (`The Matrix Obfuscations', perhaps).This review ended up being little more than a litany of complaint.  But mulling over the movie, one thing was clear: I wish they had just left the first movie alone.  A bad sequel is a kind of betrayal, as any fan of `Robocop' or `The Hidden' will tell you. Oh, well, while I'm at it, here's a prediction off the top of my head: the next Star Wars movie, when it finally comes out, is gonna suck too.  You're welcome.",4,0,0,7 November 2003
Resident Evil," All Work & No PlayStation
","Making movies out of video games is tough work.  After all, video games typically feature shallow, simplistic plots, dialogue that is corny, head-scratchingly obtuse or unintentionally hilarious, and acting that is by turns monotonous and overwrought.Actually, come to think of it, that pretty well describes the typical Hollywood early-spring release.The 'Resident Evil' series of survival-horror games is essentially a hodgepodge of various horror movies, and so the movie based on it is, if you can imagine, a hodgepodge of various horror movies.  The plot concerns dark doings in 'the Hive', a secret underground lab run by the sinister Umbrella Corporation, a bio-stuff manufacturer that is what Pfizer would be if Victor Frankenstein were on the board of directors.  An experimental zombie-creating virus is released in the Hive, prompting a response by its overseer, a smarty-pants computer with a child's persona and a number of gleefully sadistic security systems (anyone with a fear of elevators should skip the first couple scenes).  A team of corporate commandos moves in, with a number of comically elaborate weapons but few names (their medic's nametag reads, 'Medic'.) They are to secure the lab (under the circumstances, they might have better sent a crack squad of expert morticians) and shut down the computer.  Along the way, they seize a couple living in the house that provides cover for the Hive entrance, as well as a cop who was sneaking around, and, for reasons that aren't quite clear, take them along into the Hive.  The couple is suffering memory loss due to nerve-gas exposure, and no one is what they seem.  But you knew that already.  From there 'Resident Evil' turns into a zombie-killing haunted house war movie, as the heroes have to battle not only the computer, but a hellish host of undead creatures.  And it's pretty fun.The director is Paul Anderson, who also made 'Mortal Kombat', and like that movie, 'Resident Evil' is better than it really has any right to be. Anderson has a sure hand for creepy technological spaces.  He is economical with light, and manages to make the Hive both shadowy and harshly lit, with its flattening florescent lighting that make the heroes look half dead themselves.  This sense of place is very important: among the hallmarks of the 'Resident Evil' games are their effectively creepy atmospherics. Playing often finds you strolling through the eerily quiet scene of some past carnage, while unsettling ethereal music plays in the background. Anderson does not incorporate specific places from the games (as he has dispensed with the games' familiar characters), but there are echoes of them in the darkened hallways and flooded labs of the Hive.  The movie also retains the games' problem-solving sensibilities, and there is a great deal of shutting off/restoring the power, opening coded locks, etc.The acting is good, if a bit underdeveloped.  This is a relief, since the 'Resident Evil' video games seem to prize sub-competent voice acting.  Milla Jovovich plays the main character, Alice (Get it?  Alice goes down the rabbit hole?  'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'?  Oh, never mind.), and her performance starts flat and inflates slowly over the course of the movie.  I get that it's supposed to convey her memory loss, but it's still a bit uneven.  Jovovich works better when she doesn't speak, displaying a quiet, cornered-animal defiance that works well in this type of setting.  Plus her other, um, visual qualities.  As commando Rain, Michelle Rodriguez seems to be channelling Jenette Goldstein's immortal Pvt. Vasquez from 'Aliens', and setting herself up for a long line of sneering toughgirl roles.  The weak link is Eric Mabius, unconvincing as the cop, whose resume supposedly boasts Quantico and the NSA, but is largely useless when the Bad Things come (though he does oddly resemble game hero Chris Redfield).  A better performance comes from Martin Crewes as a high-strung commando, who gets to do a gratifying twist on the old 'I'm surrounded, but at least I've got one bullet left' scene.The visual style and fast pace of 'Resident Evil' largely overcome its sometimes faulty internal logic:  the transmission of the virus seems more rooted in script convenience than anything else, and the computer, while supposedly coldly logical, comes off nuttier than trail mix.  There is also an unintentionally funny twist as the heroes are stressing over how to kill the bullet-sponge zombies.  They need the computer to explain to them what anyone with even passing knowledge of horror-movie physiology already knows: the zombies' weakness is massive trauma to the cerebral cortex, i.e. shoot them in the head.  Really, what's wrong with these people?  Haven't they ever seen a George Romero movie?",8,0,0,16 March 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Too Much Avant, Not Enough Garde
","I am not the target audience for this movie.  I'm not even anywhere downrange.  I think I realized this when Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang a duet that incorporated a gamut of musical soundbites from Elton John to Whitney Houston, without once touching on a song that I don't personally loathe.  The rather odd and jokey placement of modern catchphrases and lyrics in 1900 Paris was actually not as annoying as I had feared; it was often fun to try and catch all the references.  But eventually, it degenerated into a tired gimmick.  And if 'Your Song' ever comes on my car radio again, I'll have to change the station quick or swerve into a tree or something.The anachronistic song placement is minor compared to the other sins of 'Moulin Rouge', which is basically just a Concept masquerading as a movie. There's the story to consider, which seems as if Baz Luhrmann and his accomplice screenwriter just took every cliche they could find (plus a 'Smooth 70's' compilation CD) and put them in a blender set on 'frappe', then threw the mixture against the wall, in the vain hope that something might stick.  It would have been helpful to have some kind of meta-subtitles to help us through the story (ATTENTION: For the next few minutes, this film will be channelling 'Camille'.  Please stand by.)  When the story hits a standstill, the movie just repeats its mantras (some yada-yada about Truth and Beauty, and Learning to Love and Be Loved, or something like that) as a way to jump-start the narrative and wake the audience.Luhrmann's directing style is non-stop frenetic and exhausting, with all the subtlety and nuance of a stainless steel rolling pin.  It doesn't work with this material.  He did the same thing with 'Romeo + Juliet', but at least there he had a better screenwriter.  The showy visuals and strange angles don't so much inform the story as try to distract you from it.  The Concept is everything here, and it rules 'Moulin Rouge' with an iron fist.  When a few of the scenes actually threaten to develop cinematic merit on some level, the Concept quickly batters them into submission, and the result is an unholy mess.  If incoherence were bullets, this would be a John Woo movie.The acting is terrible as well.  The two leads manage relatively well (Kidman's version of 'Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' won't make anyone forget Monroe, but it's a treat anyhow), but the rest of the cast is content to chew the scenery, spit it up, and chew it some more.  John Leguizamo is a particular disappointment.  The man has talent, and when he's on, he's the smartass Peter Lorre of his generation.  When he's not, he just yells a lot. Some actors have made a career out of being the best thing in bad movies; Leguizamo seems content to go down with the ship.You can practically see the sweat stains on this movie as Luhrmann strives to pack as much crap onscreen as possible.  The last time anyone was trying this hard in a movie, it was Jude Law crossing the Volga over the objections of homicidal Stukas in 'Enemy at the Gates'.  When it comes to pitiless annihilation, Stukas ain't got nothing on Art.Ah, well, we'll always have Paris.",3,0,1,7 July 2001
Black Hawk Down," Brilliant, unsparing war story
","A city is the worst possible place to fight a war.  The distances are short, the fields of view restricted, and the presence of high windows and rooftops means that an attack can come from any direction with no warning.  Your long-range fire-support options are limited severely by the terrain, the main guns on your tanks are all but useless, and your armored vehicles are vulnerable to ambush in the tight, narrow streets, where an enemy can rain fire down on their weakest points.  Cities are also full of people who don't want anything to do with the war, whom you have to be careful not to kill, even if your enemy displays no such compunction.Ridley Scott's visceral, intense movie 'Black Hawk Down' gives us a ground and air view of the worst urban fighting encountered by American troops since Hue City.  As the movie begins, U.S. Army troops in Somalia are attempting to crash a party and grab Mohammed Farah Aidid, the warlord who ruled the port city of Mogadishu (called 'the Mog' or 'the 'Dish' by American grunts, who nickname everything as a matter of course, including each other).  What is supposed to be a quick mission turns into a desperate battle that lasts through the night, as two Blackhawk helicopters are shot down and the security elements are surrounded by Aidid's street-gang-cum-militia, laden with AKs, RPGs, and a supply of the narcotic leaf 'khat.'The movie is first and foremost a battle picture, and Scott has pared down most other details.  Policy wonks are sure to be disappointed, as there is little discussion of the politics of the U.S. intervention in Somalia, or of the decisions affecting and affected by the outcome of the battle.  There is no pondering about whether the mission was right or wrong, or what could have been done about Somalia.  What info we get on the Somali civil war is relayed in a few short screen blurbs at the beginning.  There is only a brief reference to the decision by Clinton's then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin not to authorize the use of armored forces in support.  If that is the sort of thing you like, read Mark Bowden's book.  The movie is more concerned with covering fire, roadblocks, and hot brass sliding down the collar of your flak jacket.And that is all to the better.  What Scott has done in foregoing big-picture issues is deliver a focused and relentless depiction of combat, complete and convincing in its details: rifle slings jury-rigged with tape and 550 cord, spray-painted sniper rigs, sweat, blood, and agony.  The picture is full of small memorable moments, too many to count, and what philosophical points it makes (mostly about the sometimes heartbreaking ingenuousness of American GIs) are subtle and easily missed.  There aren't a lot of director's tricks (not that you notice anyhow), including, oddly, less of the sped-up action sequences Scott loved so much in 'Gladiator'.There are inherent difficulties associated with war movies; it can be difficult to tell the characters apart, or know exactly what each group is trying to accomplish, but Scott manages this aspect surprisingly well (for viewers, being ex-military or reading the book will help a great deal). The movie's look works to its advantage as well, making the city (Rabat, Morocco, in the role of Mogadishu) look dangerous in grim, spooky night and harsh, merciless daylight.  The movie also contains some of the most eerily beautiful shots of helicopters in formation since 'Apocalypse Now.'Battle movies tend to focus on a great many small stories.  Josh Hartnett's Sgt. Eversmann is the nominal protagonist, but we do not follow him all the time, or even most of the time.  As a result, we do not get a lot of insight into the particular characters.  In early scenes, they are sketched rather than drawn: there's the untested kid, the office hack who wants to prove himself, tension between the straight-laced brass (Jason Isaacs, last seen as the sadistic British Dragoon in 'The Patriot') and the free-wheeling special operators, etc.  The characters are given brief moments in which to establish themselves, and we're off.  Some of these work better than others; Hartnett's dialogue establishing him as an 'idealist' is especially clumsy and unconvincing.  The actors are no slouches, and there are capable performances all around, but the event is the real story here.You could knock this movie for its lack of larger context, for not examining bigger issues, for not having deeper dialogue, but these criticisms are not exactly fair.  'Black Hawk Down' is intended to give us a glimpse of something that happened, something horrible and heroic, and to give us some idea of what it was like to live through it (or not live through it).  All most people remember of the battle of Mogadishu was the dead stripped American pilot, dragged by a truck while the people we thought we were helping spit on him.  This movie shows us the insides of an event we thought we understood well enough, and shows us that there can be great valor even in defeat.  When I was in infantry school, I knew a guy who was former Army, a member of the same Ranger unit that got trapped in Mogadishu.  He was ribbed once about 'losing the fight', and he exploded.  Nobody understood what happened, he said.  Nobody knew the real story.Here's to you, Wickstrom.  They know now.",10,0,0,11 February 2002
From Hell," Saucy Jacky's Bloody Good Time
","'From Hell' is not really a horror movie, though it has some gruesome and disturbing moments, but rather a modern serial-killer movie given an unusual setting, delving into our fascination with the first truly famous serial killer in history.One of the nice things about making a Jack the Ripper movie is that it is a historical story, which lends it a certain gravitas and a built-in interest factor, but since history doesn't know for sure who the guy really was, you get to make up your own ending.  'From Hell' seizes on one of the more far-out (and frankly, historically implausible) conspiracy theories surrounding the mysterious stalker of Whitechapel.  Still, in Ripper lore there is plenty of 'evidence' that can be construed to support just about any theory you can think of, and while the movie takes a few liberties with the historical record, a great many details are rooted in established fact. While I wouldn't view this movie as a conclusive examination of the case, it gives the story enough credibility that it functions quite well as a thriller.The story follows Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp), the detective charged with catching the killer (oddly, they consistently refer to him as 'Jack the Ripper', even while the movie acknowledges that the letter bearing that name was probably a fake), while he navigates the seamy alleys of the East End, trying to protect the streetwalkers that seem to attract homicidal wrath (among them Heather Graham, as 'Black Mary' Kelly; interesting casting choice, that) and contending with the interference of Scotland Yard's shadowy and muscular Special Branch.One irritating thing about the movie is in the character of Abberline. Understandably, the movie makes him younger and sleeker so he can be played by Johnny Depp (the real-life Abberline was forty-five and married with children while investigating the Ripper case), but it also subscribes to the annoying convention of mythologizing the 'profiler'.  I swear if I see one more psychic detective who gets otherworldly 'vibes' about a case, I'm going to hurl my copy of 'Journey into Darkness' through the screen.  Hollywood seems uncomfortable dealing with profilers for what they are: experienced detectives who are able to detect patterns in a crime and extrapolate what kind of person they are looking for.  Isn't that impressive enough? Abberline was, by most accounts, a dedicated and methodical investigator, but here he is a slightly dissolute dope fiend who gets flashes of the future and 'sees' the Ripper's future victims while in an absinthe or opium-induced daze.  Often, the 'psychic detective' thing is used as a cheap springboard for a lazy screenwriter to avoid having to think about how the pieces of a puzzle might fit together; in this movie the 'visions' are not only distracting, they're really unnecessary: they reveal little that a sharp guy like Abberline couldn't figure out from available evidence.  They must have been interesting to film, though; I guess that's why they're in the movie.Twin directors Albert and Allen Hughes made their mark in the 90s with the acclaimed 'Menace II Society', one of the raft of inner-city neo-gangster opuses that were in vogue at the time.  It seems the Hugheses made a deliberate attempt to make a movie as different from that as they could, and it would seem a shrewd move.  After all, it took John Singleton a couple of movies to escape from the 'hood; and, remember what happened to Matty Rich? Yeah, me neither.  Though 'From Hell' is a story of another blighted urban landscape, there's not a drive-by in sight.  Well, maybe by hansom cab.The Hugheses make good use of the fetid, dire streets of 1880s London (actually, the movie was filmed primarily in the Czech Republic; apparently, London just ain't seedy enough anymore).  They play with light in interesting ways, silhouetting the spires of London's palaces and cathedrals against a roiling red sky, suggesting that if we aren't actually in Hell, we're at least in a pretty close suburb with bus service there.  The Ripper's hansom cab has twin lanterns that sputter with bilious green light; it looks like a primordial monster slithering through the night, which is a neat visual (useful, too; hansom cabs all look pretty much alike otherwise).The cast is good, although more so in supporting roles than lead ones.  Depp is fine, though his accent is weird.  Heather Graham is better than I expected her to be, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it wouldn't have been too hard to find a better actress (probably for less money).  Ian Holm does well as a retired surgeon who advises Abberline on the investigation, an old man with an infirm arm and a few too many secrets to keep.  Also standing out is Robbie Coltrane, as Abberline's loyal, over-literate sergeant.  Fans of 'The Elephant Man' will take special interest in a certain historical cameo.The movie is well-paced, well-filmed, and delivers the thriller goods in fine style.  It doesn't hold up to too much scrutiny, especially among those familiar with the real case, unless they're willing to be good sports. There are a few spots where, eager to fit in as many authentic details as possible, the characters do things that don't make much sense, and the exact motivations for some of the Ripper's actions are not made clear.  I suppose you shouldn't expect too much clarity form a movie about an unsolved case. Ripperologists and aspiring forensic historians should not so much suspend their disbelief as zip it in a bag and leave it at the box office for a claim stub; you can pick it up when you leave.",9,0,1,31 October 2001
Blow," Coke and a Smile
","It is 'Blow''s misfortune that it came out the same year as 'Traffic', another movie about the American drug trade, one lauded by critics, showered with awards and praise, and even credited with changes in drug policy dialogue.  Of course, it's doubly 'Blow''s misfortune that it's not a very good movie.'Blow' tells the story of George Jung, a likable Bostonian who was one of the central figures in the explosion of cocaine in the 80s.  It's a criminal biopic, sort of.  It's an exploration of a national phenomenon, kind of. It's a story about a man watching as everything he holds dear slips inexorably away from him, in a way.  It covers a lot of ground.  In this way, it resembles 'GoodFellas', but has none of that film's spark, attitude, or vivid slices-of-life.Part of the problem, I think, is in the source material.  The movie is based on a book co-written by Jung, and in many ways it is a self-serving narrative.  Unlike 'GoodFellas', (adapted from 'Wiseguy') 'Blow' doesn't look too far past its protagonist's worldview, and this skews the story badly.  We watch as he Forrest Gumps his way to the top of the cocaine trade.  Jung is not particularly interesting.  He is not a criminal mastermind, not a charismatic leader of men, not a sharp businessman, not a ruthless operator.  He's like a criminal version of Peter Sellers in 'Being There'.  He just shows up.  It's a credit to Johnny Depp's performance that we care about this guy even a little.Jung's fall comes about because everyone in his life betrays him.  They have various reasons (mostly greed, naturally), but the movie doesn't elucidate them.  We are left with the impression that everyone was just unreasoningly hostile to poor Georgie, and pathologically bent on his destruction. George doesn't seem to understand why all this is happening to him, but neither does the movie.The casting is all good news/bad news.  Ray Liotta is sadly affecting as George's gentle father who, if he has any judgments about his son's lifestyle, generally keeps them to himself.  We don't get enough of him, though.  On the other hand, we get way too much of horribly miscast Rachel Griffiths, in a shrill, grating turn as his mother.  Penelope Cruz junkies should note that despite her high billing, she is not in very much of the movie, and in much of that she's a harpy.  Franka Potente fares even worse. There is a striking performance, however, by the girl who plays Jung's daughter, and his devotion to her is one of the few things in the movie that rings right.The movie itself is not that well made.  It fails as a criminal biography, and it isn't detailed enough to be a compelling examination of the cocaine phenomenon.  Pablo Escobar, the once and future king of illicit pharmacology, makes an extremely brief appearance, just long enough to remove his sunglasses and have someone shot (Escobar here cuts something of a dashing figure; one wonders if he wouldn't have made a better subject for the movie.  Never mind.)  The general presentation of Jung's accomplishments is dubious (in one scene, he offers to tutor a roomful of cons in the fine art of drug moving, impressing them with his declaration that he 'was caught in Chicago with 660 pounds of grass.'  Somehow, the fact that he was CAUGHT with it isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of his smuggling skills).  Many scenes are silly, such as when Cruz and Depp get hot-and-heavy right after engaging in the most banal flirting this side of a frat party ('What are you smiling at?' 'What are YOU smiling at?' 'I don't know.')  In addition, there is a running narration by Jung that doesn't add anything to the movie except clumsy exposition.  The movie is also about two montages shy of becoming a slide show.  In theory, this is a visual metaphor for the fast, surreal world of drugs.  In practice, you can't see what's going on and get annoyed. There are, admittedly, a couple of wrenching scenes at the very end, but they're too little, and they come too late.In the end, 'Blow' leaves us with a few lessons:  1. Cocaine is pretty bad for you.  2. Trusting people (especially if they're Colombian) is REALLY bad for you.  3. George Jung, when you get down to it, was kind of a loser.",Null,0,0,13 April 2001
Vanilla Sky," How the Other Half Half-Lives (possible spoilers)
","'Vanilla Sky' is Cameron Crowe's remake of 'Abre los Ojos', a surrealist Spanish movie, which, like so many surrealist Spanish movies, I didn't see.The remake takes place in New York, and, as required by federal law, opens with a helicopter shot of Manhattan that passes directly over the buildings until midtown resembles a grid of concrete layer cakes.  David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a cocky young magnate who runs a Maxim-oid magazine which he inherited from his father.  Surrounding him are Julie (Cameron Diaz), a singer with whom he engages in (for him) recreational sex; Brian (Jason Lee), his cool-geek novelist sidekick; and Sofia (Penelope Cruz), a mysterious ballerina that his buddy brings to a party.  Sparks fly between Cruz and Cruise, causing jealousy all around, leading to something I guess you would call a romantic parallellogram, ending in a car wreck that disfigures Cruise's face and cripples his cockiness.  He has to rebuild his life, while struggling against 'The Board', seven sourpuss executives determined to steal his company.This is told in flashback: Cruise is in custody for murder, talking absently with a police psychologist (Kurt Russell), monitored by an ill-tempered guard who is itching for an excuse to throttle Cruise silly (maybe he saw 'Cocktail').  The story shifts between reality and dreams frequently, which is alarming to Cruise.  He doesn't know when he's dreaming or not, what is real, and what happened or what he only thinks happened.  One minute he's sharing a cozy moment with Cruz, the next he's with Diaz (one wonders how, exactly, that constitutes a problem).  Is he going crazy?  Is he dreaming? After a while of this, I was in agreement with the dyspeptic guard: gimme five minutes in a room with the screenwriter and a rubber hose; I'll get this narrative-structure thing straightened out.We spend too long early on observing Cruise's party lifestyle, watching pretty people flirt blandly with one another.  The scenes are shallow, the dialogue cutesy, until the movie threatens to become yet another dull, talky, New York-set relationship comedy (I kept expecting Edward Burns to wander into a shot).  By the time it takes a serious turn with Cruise's disfigurement, we have little invested in the characters.  Cruise's plight seems less about profound crisis than vanity: his face is messed up, but it's not THAT bad.  He's still Tom Cruise, for Pete's sake.  He no longer has stunning women throwing themselves at him every three frames or so, but then, some of us have to live with that reality every day.The acting is effective and involving, if familiar.  Cruz played this role in the original; she's on friendly territory.  And she's not alone; 'Vanilla Sky' sometimes feels like a weekend retreat for characters from other movies: Tom Cruise from 'Jerry Maguire' meets Cameron Diaz from 'A Life Less Ordinary' meets Jason Lee from 'Mallrats' meets Kurt Russell from 'Unlawful Entry'.  While Cruise has played parts like this before, there's a reason: he's good at it.  His David, post-wreck, is not always sympathetic or readable (especially while behind a 'Halloween'-style therapeutic mask), but he's never uninteresting.  What credibility David's problems have stems entirely from Cruise's performance, and it's a lot to shoulder.  The characters do develop, it just takes most of them a long time to get around to it.I should come clean, too, that I am an inveterate Cameron Diaz junkie (proof: I made it through 'Keys to Tulsa' AND 'Very Bad Things'.  My AMPAS Medal of Valor is pending.)  So I'll skip some hagiography and say she's good in a relatively small role.  Her confrontation with Cruise is deranged, disjointed, a little degrading, and heartbreaking.  Julie's nuts, but she's also a girl in love, who has been treated rather callously, and we find ourselves wanting to kick Cruise in the head (at least I did; but I get like that).  Diaz is also the first to invest her character with any kind of inner life, any signs of something under the surface.  Cruise doesn't manage that until the second reel, Cruz even later; Jason Lee never gets far beyond amiable goofiness.The movie is visually powerful, and that goes a long way.  Crowe infuses it with dreamy imagery and well-chosen music that smoothes over some of the clunky, predictable moments in the script.  The ending reveals a nifty premise well brought off (though you'll likely see it coming), and the last scenes have a weird Zen beauty to them, though they list a bit under the weight of some New Age silliness.  Unfortunately, even though we appreciate the well-crafted conclusion, there's still all the UPN-grade dramaturgy we had to slog through first.'Vanilla Sky' aims for highbrow surrealism, but the movie it most called to mind was 'Total Recall', which explored many of the same themes (granted, with more stuff blowing up).  However, its attempt with 'The Board' to inject paranoia into the story doesn't take.  Good paranoia movies work because they weave a just-plausible layer of conspiracy into real life. Because 'Vanilla Sky' is so unreal already, there's not much to be paranoid about.  How is 'The Board' supposed to dictate the reality in Cruise's head? How is anybody?I don't exactly counsel against seeing 'Vanilla Sky'.  There is enough talent wrapped up in it to make it slightly more than the sum of its flawed parts.  And, hey, anything for Cameron Diaz.",6,0,0,16 December 2001
