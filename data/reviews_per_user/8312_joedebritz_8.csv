Casablanca," Stuck in Morrocco, Refugees Seek Desperately for Passage to America
","This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Everything about it is absolutely perfect. The story is so rich with social meaning and significance. It portrays the absolute terror that was occurring during WWII without being grotesque or violent. It shows how desperate people were to keep their heads above water, and out of Nazi control. The acting is phenomenal. Humphrey Bogart is effortlessly cool, and translates the idea of the isolationist mentality of Americans at the time before the war. Ingrid Bergman is so pure and honest, her character comes across through the incredible emotion she is able to express on screen. All of this aside, the thing that absolutely sets this movie apart from others like it is the writing. The script is amazing. It might be the best script ever. Every line is carefully thought out. No line is a waste everything anyone says has meaning. Please go watch this movie. It will change how you look at film in America.",10,2,3,11 March 2015
Chinatown," Chinatown
","This film is perfect. I cannot find any flaws in this movie whatsoever. This is Jack Nicholson at his best he is completely engulfed in the role, and in a way there could not be a J.J. Gittes without Nicholson. Faye Dunaway is no exception, she is just as precise as Nicholson, and the two compliment each other throughout the film continually. Polanski is a brilliant director. The mise-en-scene of this film is really unmatched. Everything comes together to give the audience the amazing experience of the movie. The scenery of the desert is perfect for this film. Everything about this movie leads up to the final scene, where you realize that even if you do everything right, and try as hard as you can to do the right thing it does not work out. This film is sometimes categorized as a neo-noir, and the ending satisfies that classification.",10,4,7,13 May 2015
Citizen Kane," A Epic Chronicle of the Life of Charles Foster Kane
","This is an absolutely breathtaking masterpiece. It is masterfully crafted, culminating to a magnificently heart wrenching end. The acting in this film is absolutely amazing. Orson Welles transforms just as Kane does throughout the film. Every shot means something, there is nothing wasted, and no filler whatsoever. The dialogue is dramatic and meaningful. In other films that attempt to do the same thing that this film does fall flat in several categories. There tends to be overacting, long, boring dramatic shots, and overpowering soundtracks. Citizen Kane falls to none of these ailments. The shots are beautiful, the actors do not over do it, while still being completely dedicated to their roles. There are long shots, but the editing it tight and fluid. This is a must see if you have not seen it. One of the best films ever.",9,2,4,13 May 2015
Annie Hall," A Perfect Romantic Comedy
","This is Woody Allen at his best. This film is hilarious, thoughtful, and beautiful. It is the best romantic comedy I have ever scene. For some reason this genre is saturated with terrible, formulaic films. Annie Hall is not one them. This film has some of the most clever writing of any movie I have ever seen. Unlike most comedies, this film does not go for cheap laughs. Every line is very well thought out. There are many references to literature and film that make the film all the more rich with different levels of comedy. The factor that puts this film over the top from great to amazing is that chemistry between Diane Keaton and Woody Allen. They were in a relationship at one point around the time the film was made and it is clear that some of the emotion in the film comes from real feeling.",8,0,0,13 May 2015
The Graduate," Graduate Finding a Way to Spend his Summer
","This is an excellent film. It is written exceptionally well. The dialogue is funny as well as dramatic when it needs to be. The acting in the is film is particularity impressive. Dustin Hoffman is excellent as Benjamin. He portrays a young man unsure of how things will turn out perfectly. He also does a great job of playing a man who is hopelessly in love. The editing in this film is probably the most original part. There are some really amazing shots that fade perfectly into others. The famous scene of Ben jumping in the pool with his new scuba gear is purely innovative. I recommend this film to anyone, one of my all time favorites.",9,1,1,13 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," A Brilliantly Crafted Musical.
","I am not a fan of musicals. I never have been, and I would not choose to watch one over any other genre (within reason). But, Singing in the Rain is the exception to the rule. It is by far the most watchable musical I have ever seen. The acting is excellent, the songs are catchy, and it has a generally heart-warming charm to it. This film is beautiful to look at. The shot composition is artistic, as well as the rich, colorful costumes and backgrounds. This film is shot with technicolor, and it is clear. The color is vibrant and crisp, it really adds to the mise-en-scene of the film. I recommend this film to anyone, even a hater of musicals.",8,0,2,13 May 2015
Pulp Fiction," Story of Confusion
","This is an excellent film and one of Tarentino's best. It has a powerful feeling to it that really captures you. This is one the most original movies I have ever seen. It is not told in chronological order at all, and therefore leaves you guessing on what is going to happen. The acting in this film is very well done, Travolta, Jackson, and Willis make a great combination of the rag tag criminals that make up this film. The thing about this film that really stands out is the cinematography and the editing. There are some very original shots in this movie that make it hard to turn away from. I recommend this film to anyone.",7,0,1,13 May 2015
Psycho," Hitchcock at his best
","This is a brilliant film. It takes a little bit of getting used to, it can come off as a little corny at first, but once you get sucked into it, the movie is amazing. I believe that is pretty much paved the way for every single horror movie after it. It is a testament to the genius of Alfred Hitchcock. He really understood suspense and how it effects the audience. The Shots in the is film are brilliantly planned out. They make you think exactly what you are supposed to think, until you learn what is really happening. I already knew what was going to happen when I saw this movie, yet it was still shocking. that is what makes it so great.",8,1,2,13 May 2015
