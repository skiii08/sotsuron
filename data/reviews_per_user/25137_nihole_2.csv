The Blair Witch Project," Not that scary
","I finally went to see this movie and let me say I was somewhat disappointed. Yes the concept behind the movie was absolutely fabulous, however, the movie only became scary at the end, and that was it!!!  The movie is good at presenting the conflicts between characters subjected to isolation in the middle of the woods.  The characters emotions were so genuine the 'documentary' felt very real.  A scary movie, no.  A well thought out and very intriguing story, yes!!",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
American Beauty," OVERRATED
","This movie has to be one of the most overrated movies of all time!  Yes the story was interesting but the movie eventually climaxed to nothing.  You already knew what would happen to Lester it was just a matter of how.  And when you did find out what really happened it was, to say the least, underwhelming.  This is just your run of the mill All American drama that does not deserve the acclaim it is receiving although Annette Benning is terrific!!",5,0,0,24 January 2000
