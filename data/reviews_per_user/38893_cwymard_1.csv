Gremlins," Gremlins isn't a comedy
","This film contains graphics that are not supposed to be seen by children of any age no matter what age you are. When I first saw the film, I was repulsed. A gremlin choking the mother with Christmas lights, a dog hung up in Christmas lights ( surprised the ASPCA didn't get involved ). A gremlin firing an arrow into the hero's arm. Gremlins eating a Santa Claus, Gremlins sending Flo from the show Alice out of a window, no matter how mean she was in the film,  she didn't deserve killing, no matter how she was killed.Yes,I can see that the film shows to follow the rules but still there is a limit of how much torture you can see on screen. I also spotted something else about the film. Don't you think that with all the killing they do in the film, that film also shows them having a caring, warm, gentleness of them when they are watching Snow White. I think that was a big mistake. First have them kill the citizens of the town then have them sing Hi Ho from Snow White, that's ridiculous.",Null,0,1,24 August 2003
