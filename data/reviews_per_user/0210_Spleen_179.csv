The Rock," Who was dill enough to hand such good material to Michael Bay?
","I won't say the script is perfect.  Some of the dialogue clunks - that corny speech the president gives!  I mean, really:  `How does one weigh eighty lives against five million?'  One counts.  -Or my favourite (no doubt I paraphrase a little): `We can't risk letting him loose.  He's an escape artist.'  It's funnier than `You can't fight in here, it's the war room,' but I suspect the humour was unintentional.  And however over the top the action may have been, it all seems much sillier when we're casually informed that John Mason knows all of the FBI's secrets: `The alien ship at Roswell, who really shot J.F.K. ...'; I was surprised they didn't add, `... and the truth about the Cottingley fairies.'  These clunky lines eat away at the script's solid foundation like acid.  It's particularly bad to watch how keen the film seems to be to undermine its two main characters, Mason and Goodspeed.  Sean Connery (Mason), and to an even greater extent, Nicholas Cage (Goodspeed) are frequently called upon to drop out of character in order to deliver some tough-guy sarcastic comment; it's never worth it.  The most jarring moment comes when Connery says, `Your BEST?  Losers always whine about doing their best.  Winners go home and hump the prom queen.' (Actually, he used a different verb; but - and I strongly disapprove of this censorship regulation - the IMDb won't permit me to reproduce it here.)  Not only is this not the kind of thing Mason would say; nobody from outside the United States would ever, in any context, utter the phrase `prom queen'.But these departures from character at least show us that Mason and Goodspeed had characters to depart FROM.  This is something, surely.  In fact it's a good deal.  The characters actually survive the corrosive process the writers have put them through.  There are a lot of ideas - plot and character ideas, I mean - in `The Rock', and they're mostly rather good ideas.  (Okay, ONE of the ideas is, `terrorist threatens to destroy city unless his rather silly demands are met' - an oldie, but a goodie.)  The story is well built and it feels satisfying however much the fascist military sentimentalism sours the palate, however many of Michael Bay's damned music video montages we have to sit through, however the rapid cutting tends to confuse rather than enlighten us as to exactly what's going on during the action sequences.  A good story triumphs - at least to some degree - over poor execution.NB:  Not once but twice a character sticks a syringe into his own heart.  I find this kind of thing MUCH more disturbing to watch than most of the things people complain about seeing in the cinema; I suspect I'm not alone, and I feel it's my duty to warn others.  Notwithstanding this, or anything else I've said, it's an enjoyable movie.",6,1,1,2 May 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Dull incompetence wrapped up in false advertising
","It's either a documentary or a work of fiction.  If it's a documentary it's a fraudulent one.  (It's not even a clever fraud.  I wouldn't have thought that such grotesquely inept camera-jiggling could have fooled anyone; but apparently it did.)  If it's a documentary then it's none of MY business to condemn it - I should simply report the scam to the police, the broadcasting tribunal, etc. and hope that someone will have the nerve to prosecute.Taken as a work of fiction `The Blair Witch Project' is possibly the most wretched that has ever come to my attention.  I'm serious.  I can think of works of fiction that are worse in some positive way - books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, for instance - and I can't be expected to keep every single forgettable old book or television show lodged in my memory - still, I know of no other work so thoroughly lacklustre.  We don't even get the bare minimum of competent camera work we demand as a matter of course in other lame, incompetent endeavours.  The camera wobbles stupidly and does NOTHING else.  It doesn't even give us information.  The characters TELL us everything that's going on, in their long-winded way; they then offer us the camera footage as a kind of proof that they're not lying.  What's true of the images is true of the sound, too.  Heather and crew hear some `scary' noises at night; but do WE get a chance to listen to them properly, to decide for ourselves if they're scary or not?  Nope: instead we get an earfull of everyone panicking and DESCRIBING the sounds that I'm surprised they can still hear over the gabble of their own voices.How could something so bad as `The Blair Witch Project' turn a profit?  How could it show, not just a profit, but the greatest return on investment of any film in history; how could it, despite all the people who walked out of the cinema or wished that they had, produce a few testimonials from people who said that they were duly scared - even that they LIKED it?  I think I have an answer.  The film disguised itself as a documentary.  The dullest footage of the most banal murder has its attractions, provided it's genuine. Fictional murders have to work, so to speak, to be interesting: real murders automatically are.  A simple lie can transform eighty minutes of utter rubbish into box office gold.But you wouldn't want to tell an open lie too blatantly or too consistently. The law still has SOME teeth.  A better tactic is to persuade people to pretend - not imagine, but PRETEND - that they're watching a documentary. If we can't really believe that this is a documentary, they'd like us to come as close to really believing as possible.  Fiction is all about `suspending disbelief', right?Well, no, it isn't.  A good work of fiction can frighten us, thrill us, fill us with aching longing and/or keen interest, etc. without asking us to be so feeble-witted as to suspend disbelief.  `The Blair Witch Project' can't.P.S.:  Some say we should be merciful because the film only cost $30 000 to make.  But what does this have to do with us?  It's not as if they reduced admission prices in consequence.",1,1,4,19 May 2000
The Mask," How to cast Jim Carrey
","It's hard to use Jim Carrey in a movie.  He's very good at his rapid-fire mimicry routine, but how can it ever be anything other than a diversion from both character and story?  (Very rarely is it a pleasant diversion.  `Ace Ventura' was unendurable.)  And yet, what else can you do with him?The `Mask' solves the problem so neatly it almost cheats.  The story is ABOUT someone with a double life - so by day, Carrey does all the character and story stuff, and by night, wearing the mask, he does his stand-up schtick.  The two are as integrated as they need to be.  It's pulled off with such an air of innocence I can't possibly complain.  SOME of the clichés (those to do with the police especially) are so very worn out that even the most thorough of movie-goers is surprised to find them still alive; but the writer seems to have been honestly unaware that they were clichés, so that's okay.I was told that the film is saturated with animation in-jokes.  I couldn't spot very many.  Stanley-with-the-mask has the soul of a Tex Avery cartoon character: I suspect that's all there is to it.  The computer animation, or the computer-enhancement of Carrey's animation, is tastefully done.  It never looks pasted over the top of the footage the way so much computer animation does.  (`The Mask' failed to win an Oscar in the special effects category - like so many other more deserving films, it was beaten by `Forrest Gump'.)  The Cuban dance numbers are irresistible, as is Stanley's pet dog.  Sure, `The Mask' is no masterpiece, but it's a clever, charming film that richly deserved its runaway success.",8,66,88,19 December 1999
Vertigo," DUM-dum-dum DEE-dee-dee, DUM-dum-dum DEE-dee-dee
","`Vertigo' is Hitchcock's first deeply odd film.  There would be two more: `The Birds' (1963) and `Marnie' (1964).  After that he returned to the straight-forward, sane plots of his youth.  (`Frenzy' (1972), for instance, is yet another version - by my count, the fifth - of `The 39 Steps'.)`Rope' was filmed all in one continuous shot, and `Spellbound' had dream sequences designed by Salvador Dali, but that's not the kind of thing I mean.  It's the moral outlook of `Vertigo' that's odd.  `OF COURSE Scottie will behave in this fashion,' Hitchcock seems to be saying.  `Who wouldn't?' I don't know why I'm so willing to play along: maybe it's the surreal way San Fancisco is shot so that it appears to be a city not of this Earth, maybe the score by Bernard Herrmann.  (It's easily and beyond doubt Herrmann's best Hitchcock score).  Part of the reason I so enjoy following a film that is, objectively speaking, so slow, surely has to do with the fact that Scottie's motivation is explained, but it's never explained in advance. An air of suspense permeates the picture without being concentrated in any one part.I find it hard to understand the people who prefer `North by Northwest'.  IF you're a fan of the American Hitchcock - I'm an Anglophile, myself - then this is surely the apotheosis, the perfect expression of everything Hitchcock had been reaching towards in America.  This is a film GROWN in America, not a transplant from foreign soil the way `North by Northwest' is. (Yes, I know it's based on something French, but that's beside the point: it's the place where Hitchcock first makes the transfer to celluloid that's important.)  Preferring `Rear Window' or `Psycho', on the other hand: THAT I could understand.To conclude with a gauche display of star-worship, Kim Novak is surely Hitchcock's most attractive ever female lead - and she plays an interesting character, too, which is more than can be said for most of Hitchcock's actresses.  If Scottie must become obsessed to the point of madness with anyone, let it be her.  Sorry, Midge, but that's what you're up against.",9,2,3,17 December 1999
Requiem for a Dream," Well, THAT was a waste of a good title.
","You need a strong stomach for this film, just as you need a strong stomach to drink seawater.  In both cases, what's the point?  Watching Aronofsky's film isn't so much like drinking seawater as being rubbed all over with sandpaper - a treatment painful beyond belief, yet superficial.  No doubt Aronofsky STARTED with the intention of saying something about the Oprah Winfrey 'follow your dream' mentality, but that idea was lost or buried in the early planning stages; all that he successfully demonstrates is how bad heroin and those colourful little weight loss tablets are.  For most people it's not worth finding out.  We already knew THAT they were bad.  If a few souls are dissuaded from taking these substances I suppose that will justify the film, more than compensating for my suffering and for the fact that it's a rotten work of art.In 'Pi' (which wasn't a rotten work of art) Aronofsky showed that he didn't know how to use black and white; here he shows he doesn't know how to use colour, either.  I didn't know it was possible to get that sewage-filtered look on film - I thought you needed digital tape.  And if Aronofsky wants miserable overcast lighting, that's fine, I really have no quarrel, but he should wait for the sun to stop shining before trying to get it.  It's that modern auteur's disease, the desire to achieve all visual effects by manipulating the camera, without trying first to manipulate what's in front of the camera.  Hence also that jarring split screen effect.  At one point Aronofsky even splits the screen to get both his actors in the same frame, when they're lying together in the same bed.  A director with any sense would have tried asking them to lie closer together.The terrible thing is that Aronofsky is talented.  The difference between his technique and, say, Oliver Stone's, is the difference between thought and bombast; you know where Aronofsky's going with his visual gimmicks, even if there's usually a better way he could have got there.  This is more true in 'Requiem' than in 'Pi'.  Aronofsky is getting better at making worse movies.  It's frightening to think how bad his next one will be, if he improves any more.",2,5,10,5 August 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Let's stop playing games - bad is bad
","The main line of defence seems to be: lighten up, it's just entertainment / just a kid's movie / just a special effects flick.  Pausing awhile to note that people who run this line of defence have all but conceded that the film is, in fact, bad, let's take these points one by one - shall we?As entertainment it's poor.  Dialogue is flat and perfunctory (don't expect to be dazzled by repartee); the story lacks the beauty of the first Star Wars film and the tension of the second ... and then there's the magical `character development' everyone complains about.  We must distinguish character development from character delineation.  The former is nice, but the latter is absolutely essential, and it's the latter that's missing from `The Phantom Menace'.  Jar Jar, the young Obi Wan, Darth Maul, Armidala, Annakin - all are scarcely characters at all, and are very difficult to get enthused about.  Jar Jar in particular is a collection of mannerisms, nothing more.  This lack of character doesn't just prevent the film from becoming the darling of the intellectuals - it makes it dull.  There are hundreds more entertaining films.  Only those people who entered the cinema carrying plastic light sabers, grimly determined to enjoy themselves, failed to notice this.It's a kid's movie.  Well, yes, in a sense - but not a good sense.  Good children's movies form a proper subset of good movies - simply because adults have access to all childhood emotions and desires, but not vice versa.  So in one sense a `kid's movie' is just a movie that can be understood and apperaciated by children (as well as adults).  Is this a kid's movie in that sense?  Maybe.  But it's also a kid's movie in the bad sense: it's deeply witless, and inexperienced children might - I say, MIGHT - fail to notice just how witless it is.  Children may - I say, MAY - ignore the fact that Jar Jar Binks is a deeply irritating non-character because he is all colour and movement and he speaks funny.  Is this really all we want?Special effects.  These aren't so hot, either.  George Lucas has fallen in love with computers and failed to notice that his digital animals don't move at all in the way that real animals move - worse still, they don't move like any kind of physical object at all.  Nor do most of the alleged physical objects.  Compare the trundling white juggernaut at the start of `Star Wars' - a convincingly solid model - with the insubstantial collection of pixels that darts past us at the start of `The Phantom Menace'.  The special effects have actually deteriorated, and to make matters worse, there are more of them.So the defence that `The Phantom Menace' is allowed to be a poor movie because it really wasn't trying to be something great in the first place, just won't wash.  Especially so, given the ludicrous claims George Lucas has arrogantly made, again and again.  So Jar Jar Binks is the first digitally created main character?  Rubbish - the dragon in `Dragonheart' predates it (and, one might add, is at the very least a genuine character).  So George Lucas is pioneering a new kind of filming-making, more like painting and less like photography, than the old?  Absolute twaddle - Walt Disney did THAT in the 1930s.  I'll tell you what IS new.  Never before has there been so much sizzle, and so little sausage.",4,296,497,6 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," On the whole, worse than the worst reports
","A standard critical comment is, 'The special effects were fine; but the script ...'  Well, the special effects weren't fine.  They were an embarrassing failure.  They were never as convincing as those of the first two movies (and, on the whole, they fell short of the third as well). Very little looks or feels or moves as if it were solid.  Lucas gets around this problem by switching camera angles at random so as to never let us get a clear view of anything.  It must have worked.  Legions of fans were willing to walk out of cinemas saying dutifully how good the special effects were; and those who disliked the film as a whole found other bones of contention and so were willing to concede the point.Jar Jar isn't the only thing wrong with 'The Phantom Menace', but he's illustrative of almost everything wrong.  He follows the central characters around like a mosquito but usually has no particular reason for being on screen.  His motivations are obscure.  He looks so phoney you wouldn't believe even when he stands still: and the more he moves, the phonier he looks.  His dialogue is horrible - but so is everyone else's.Incompetence is the verdict one must carry away from this film - a strange thing, given the number of manifestly competent people who worked on it. I am by no means willing to write off episodes 2 and 3.  But we must now write off episode 1.  The pretence that this is anything other than a turkey-shaped blot on the Star Wars series, must stop.",4,6,11,8 June 1999
The Sound of Music," I love `The Sound of Music' - but I understand why some don't
","What Rodgers may lack of pure style, / He makes up for - well, once in a while - / By the way he can bluster / From the depths of lacklustre / To the almost transcendently vile.Apologies to John Ciardi, who composed a version of this limerick in honour of someone else - but it exactly sums up my attitude towards Richard Rodgers and, to a lesser extent, Oscar Hammerstein.  Rodgers was never much of a musician.  His spectacular box-office success makes little sense when you consider that his contemporaries included (at different times) George Gershwin, Kurt Weill and Leonard Bernstein - all composers who could blow him out of the water and who all, incidentally, wrote better songs.  Rodgers and Hammerstein specialised in middlebrow inoffensiveness.  But every so often they would leave this realm and enter that of the positively bad: `Surrey with a Fringe on Top', `A Gal Who Can't Say No', `Clam Bake', `I'm Gonna to Wash that Man Right out of My Hair' and `State Fair' are all songs with a pungent stink.`The Sound of Music' is their best work.  It never stinks, it's heartfelt, and at any rate it avoids the air of calculated innovation and phoney bigness that pervades most of their other musicals.  And this is a glorious transfer to the screen, it really is.  (Note that Robert Wise was also responsible for the screen version of `West Side Story'.)  Its weaknesses stem from weaknesses in the original.  For instance:Too many songs occur in performances for the benefit of other characters - it's the old let's-put-on-a-show problem.  By the end of `Lonely Goatherd' we are fidgeting and wondering when we'll ever be done with the impromptu theatrical productions, and if the story will ever be allowed to proceed. The lyrics for `Something Good' were written by Rodgers himself and they demonstrate that Hammerstein's job was much harder than it looked.  `So Long, Farewell' is just too slight in every way to be worth staging - and it's staged TWICE, no less.  And some dialogue that might work on stage plays cheezily on the screen.On the other hand, the Rodgers and Hammerstein style for once truly suits its subject.  Many of the songs are children's songs, nursery songs (`My Favourite Things'), beginner's songs (`Do Re Me'), or simple patriotic folksongs (`Edelweiss').  Even more musically sophisticated things like the title song come off well.  Yes, this musical isn't at all innovative, but then Rodgers was never GOOD at innovation - that kind of thing was better left to Gerwshin, Weill, Bernstein, et al.It's a pity that `The Sound of Music' is the only `epic' musical that many people see - `West Side Story' and `Fiddler on the Roof' are better examples of the genre, and at any rate give a more balanced view of what it's capable of.  But I must side with those who say that it's nonetheless a great movie. The script is (mostly) sharp, the languid direction is appropriate and engrossing, and it simply LOOKS good.  Besides, like everyone else, I've seen it more times than I can count.  Does that mean anything?",10,3,12,30 August 1999
Ali," A fine work, more well-proportioned than it's given credit for being
","The short cut to being counted as a genuine auteur is to use one utterly bizarre, unjustifiable device in each film.  Here, it's the interpolation of digital footage.  Every so often, in the middle of what is otherwise a real film, we'll get some muddy shots that were taken with a digital camera, sometimes shots of the very same kind of thing we'd just seen in 35mm.  It doesn't happen very often (thank goodness).  Why does it happen at all?Let's pretend it doesn't.  All in all what's striking is how WELL the movie has been shot - yea, even with the shaky camerawork, which ruined 'The Insider' but somehow makes us feel as though we're watching history itself here; besides which, it looks damned good, which is the main thing.I loathe boxing.  I would be delighted to see it vanish off the face of the Earth.  I have to strain to make myself believe that people actually paid to see the fights we see here - quite apart from anything else, how long do they last, half an hour? less? -And yet, I found myself seeing something of what other people see in the sport, as I watched the opening fight sequence and saw, actually SAW, that there IS more to it than two men punching each other until one of them falls over.  (Television footage of actual boxing had never had any such effect on me.)The film sticks to a ten-year segment of Mohammed Ali's life and doesn't step outside it.  'We see virtually nothing about how he was raised,' says one writer here, 'what his parents were like, what kind of values they instilled in him, what motivated him to become a boxer and, most importantly, what drew him so passionately to the creed espoused by the Nation of Islam.'  I chose this quote at random; hundreds of other people have said much the same thing, but unlike them, and unlike the person I've quoted, I see this as the film's primary strength, not a weakness at all. Attempts to tell 'the story' of so-and-so's life rarely come to anything much.  The sin is always to try to include too much (and likely as not, fail).  Here, we see events which we sense have a cause (they don't feel manufactured), even though we never see what the cause is, and if we don't always know what Ali is thinking or exactly what he is feeling, well, what of it?  We're given enough to go on to make educated guesses.  As with the superb 'Topsy-Turvy', we're given a SEGMENT of history, which feels as though it's still connected to the pieces of history on either side of it, which nonetheless, when held up to the light like this, turns out to have a satisfying shape of its own.",8,1,2,1 August 2002
The Ring," A pretty good film, but...
","I'm tempted to be as harsh as possible, on principle. This film cost $US45 million to make. The cost of striking, say, 3,000 subtitled prints of the original Japanese 'Ringu', which had already been made and paid for, would have been, effectively, nothing, since distribution costs aren't included in that $45 million figure anyway. It would have made as much sense to have paid $45 million in salaries to the hundreds of people who served on the cast and crew making them shuffle around in aimless circles for three months.I'm not saying this because 'The Ring' happens to be a remake. There's nothing wrong with that. I don't think Francis Ford Coppola should have been deterred from making his 1992 'Dracula' by the existence of John Badham's 1979 'Dracula'. Clearly, Coppola felt that he had his own approach to the material, and he was right. It was, admittedly, a stupid approach, and he bungled it even so, but you can't blame a man for trying. The 1979 'Dracula' was itself an nth-generation remake, and IT was an effectively different movie from ITS predecessors ... and in at least some cases, a better one.But a mere four years separate the Nakata's 'Ringu' from Verbinski's 'The Ring' (less, if you count from when the original was released to when the remake commenced pre-production), which is hardly likely to be enough time to come up with a distinct viewpoint - and Verbinski seems to have one out of his way to avoid doing this. Even the locations seem to have been chosen so as to duplicate the original Japanese locations as precisely as possible; they've also been shot in almost exactly the same manner. When we get our first glimpse of Anna Morgan it came as a shock to me that she white, not Asian. What was I expecting? I don know, but I probably forgot, for the moment, which movie I was watching. (By the way, the fact that the villainess isn't Japanese is actually a problem. The thick veil of black hair that covers her face - this, too, Verbinski has slavishly copied - looks far more like the work of make-up artists trying too hard.)Since it's been slavishly and competently copied from a brilliant original, there's no denying that 'The Ring' is a good movie. Everything that worked in the original also works (to some degree) here; it probably also worked in the Korean remake, and if the film's ever made in Germany, it will probably work there, too. But a director who binds his fingers in this fashion and forces them to trace the outlines of someone else's work is highly unlikely to be able to command as much power. The most extreme example of this effect is Gus Van Sant's remake of 'Psycho', scene-for-scene identical to a masterpiece yet bordering on being downright bad. And when Van Sant DID have the nerve to change something and strike his own path, the result was, to put it kindly, unmotivated; to put it more accurately, breathtakingly moronic. The same happens to a lesser degree here. Nakata's 'Ringu' had an admirable simplicity. Verbinski, aware that he's contributing nothing of substance, can't help gilding the lily here and there, which does only mild harm, but cetainly no good. For example, there's too much STUFF on that cursed videotape. The heroine in this version has at least a dozen different premonitions of her impending demise - nosebleeds, horses, water, dreams, scars, coughed-up wires, ladders, blurred photographs - where two or three would have been more than enough. And the added digital effects serve no purpose other than to let us know that there are digital effects.In this fashion Verbinski ruins Nakata's scariest scene.Spoilers follow... The scariest scene in the original was the one in which the villainess crawled out of the well in the videotape... and then proceeded to crawl out of the television, and across the room, as well. This took place in a small, closed, sparsely furnished apartment, in the dark, and we saw it in a single, unblinking, front-on camera shot. Verbinski sets the sene in a a more open place with plenty of windows and he keeps CUTTING: showing Samara crawling out of the television from the front, then from the side (in the kind of effects shot designed to make the trickery of the special effects people look more imressive, at the expense of everything else), then from a long shot, all the while jumping back and forth between this and action taking place elsewhere.I could forgive Verbinski these missteps on the grounds that he has, after all, made a decent, involving, atmospheric, and mildly terrifying film. But it really is the original all over again. The only difference is that it's not as good.",Null,0,1,14 March 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Hurrah!
","Here's a sordid confession - when I was twelve or so, I preferred 'Indianna Jones and the Temple of Doom'.  A few years later, when 'Last Crusade' was released, I thought that IT was the best in the trilogy.  Yes, that's the kind of fool I was.  I even thought that sections of 'Raiders' were just a trifle dull.  THAT'S the kind of fool I was.But I grew up, and, as you would expect, my admiration for the first Indianna Jones film has done nothing but increase; it's now clear as day to me that it's the best thing Spielberg has ever done.  (Not quite clear as day.  In order to be sure I'd have to see 'The Sugarland Express'.)  For this film alone Spielberg deserves a place at the High Table with the great directors.  It's one of the most purely pleasurable cinematic outings of all time.  Perhaps we can't credit Spielberg for the perfectly cantilevered script (what a pity it was to spoil its perfection, by making other Indianna Jones films, good though the second one was), or for the tub-thumpingly terrific musical score.  How lucky Spielberg was to find John Williams, a composer not afraid to write actual music, as opposed to mood noises; nor afraid to take everything seriously, even as he underlined the humour.  Like Spielberg himself.  And I suppose Spielberg was lucky to make the film in 1981.  Made today, it would be arch and hip and flippant, it would showcase inferior special effects, and the soundtrack would be poorly recorded.But good fortune is a tiny part of the story.  This is CLEARLY a film made by a director with eagle-eyed quality control: it contains not a weak shot, nor a dead scene, nor an uncommitted performance, nor a dud line.  (Whatever happened to that director?)  You may START, as I did, thinking of it as a slightly-too-slow-but-still-fun adventure yarn ... but as you watch it again and again (and you will), you'll come to realise that it's a cinematic masterpiece.",10,1,2,12 October 2001
Spartacus," Sincere, optimistic Roman epic
","Yes, I know I shouldn't comment on other people's comments, however silly they may be; but sometimes they may represent commonly held falsehoods.  So let me state: (1) No, it is NOT worth killing thousands of people in a civil war in order to free one woman and a child, and (2) The film never claims that it is.  `Spartacus' is, indeed, an optimistic film; with an ending of neither unrelieved gloom nor unleavened triumph; but what MAKES it an optimistic film has nothing to do with the way it ends.Instead the optimism derives from the following ...  The ancient world was a brutal and uncongenial place, and a modern human rights activist, the sort that your average Hollywood director would so glibly plonk in amongst the togas, would be crushed within a week - and it would only take that long because of the lack of attention he would get.  `Spartacus' is a plausible story of how noble aspirations might grow and even flower out of such unpromising ground.  That Spartacus could achieve anything at all is a kind of a triumph.  Of course, it's not enough for the movie to SAY this; it also has to build the world carefully, so that the message I mentioned doesn't seem like a post hoc attempt to wring some hope from the mud - and it doesn't.It's also a grand old epic, obeying all the rules of the genre.  It looks as if it had as many extras as the Romans themselves had.  It has battle scenes.  It has more great actors than you can poke a stick at ... among them Peter Ustinov, who gave his best performance: a caricature of a slave owner, but a realistic and insightful caricature.  It has great photography. (Kubrick couldn't use a camera clumsily if he tried.)  It covers a great deal of ground, with two or three apparently disparate plot strands turning out to belong together, without coinciding too neatly.  It creates its own world.  In every respect (musical score excepted) it towers over every other ancient world epic.",10,1,3,1 September 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," If I sound bitter, it's because I loved this film when it first came out..
","I would have been nine or so.  It just goes to show that you should be deeply sceptical of the aesthetic judgements of a nine-year-old - even if that nine-year-old is yourself.  What a let-down it was to watch the film later and realise I'd been had!Not completely had: John Williams's score, one of his very best, is still stunning (the only part of the film that doesn't show its age, in fact); Spielberg moves from scene to scene with great assurance, hiding from a trusting audience the fact that he's telling a story that makes little sense; and I must admit that the two key children, Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore, have both charm and talent.
There's also a great bicycle chase scene.  We need more bicycle chases - this one is easily the highlight of the film.But couldn't Spielberg have spent his resources on a story that didn't fall apart when exposed to bright light?  For a start this shouldn't have been a science fiction story.  Pure fantasy would have worked better.  (Impure fantasy, which is what this is, always feels awkward.)  We have a supposedly intelligent alien race, capable of mounting a sophisticated interstellar expedition - or, in other words, sneaking into the outskirts of Los Angeles at night for an hour or so only to scuttle off in fear when, surprise, surprise, humans appear.  What did they expect?  Oh - and they fail to notice that one of their number isn't aboard when they take off.  How smart are these aliens, exactly?  Judging from ET himself (there's some reason to think of it as a he), brighter than dogs, not so clever as chimps.  And then there's the way the stranded ET alerts the other ETs that he's missing - with a ploy that comes straight out of `Gilligan's Island'.  Nope: the trappings of science fiction don't suit this story at all.Not that removing them would remove any non sequiturs from the script.  Why does ET suddenly recover?  Why must he be hidden from NASA?  Why must he be hidden from Elliot's mother?  And is there ANY explanation for the behaviour of the aliens as a whole?  I'm not unearthing irrelevancies here: all these things drive the plot.But who cares, you can hear the director thinking, the kids won't notice any of this until they're older.  He's probably right.  Children can be manipulated into consuming any old rubbish - but sometimes, when they're older, they resent having been so manipulated.  At any rate, they ought to.",9,2,4,6 November 1999
Casablanca," The best of a kind
","Spoilers ahead.I didn't understand the film properly until I read Danny Peary's essay on it in the first of his three 'Cult Movies' books (which, by the way, you MUST read, although you should be aware that Peary's complaints about 'The Red Shoes' aren't even near the mark).  The key (and, in retrospect, obvious) insight is this: all along, Captain Renault WANTED Rick to become a hero again.  As long as Rick was content to adopt a cynical, self-serving attitude, Renault, a man made of lesser material, had an excuse to do the same - and he wanted that excuse to be denied him.  When it WAS denied him he was delighted.  THAT'S he joined the side of the angels, without even hesitating.  (It's also why he spent so much time earlier poking fun of Rick's former idealism, in an attempt to get Rick to defend it.)  This probably strikes many people as obvious; I regret to say I had to have it pointed out to me.I don't have to argue that this is a great film.  We all know it is.  Peary calls it the ONLY film that's everything the old-style studio films were trying to be, and he's probably right.  This doesn't, of course, mean that it's the BEST film of the 1940s; better still are the bolder, more ambitious productions made by more inspired directors: 'Citizen Kane', 'The Red Shoes', 'Fantasia', and so forth.  But 'Casablanca' is probably as high as it is possible to fly without making a Philistine studio executive reach for his heart tablets.  This is higher praise than it sounds.  And if you think it IS the best film of the 1940s, after all ... well, I can see your point of view.",9,7,9,16 April 2002
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Great moment in cinema, weak lead rabbit and all
","I loved it, but I'm going to nit-pick for a few moments.  Do you mind?It was set in 1941, yet you'll notice the appearance of one or two characters (notably Droopy) who were unknown at that time.  (Of course, 'unknown' doesn't mean 'non-existent'.)  The Goofy cartoon we see in the cinema wasn't made until 1949.  (I looked it up: but I didn't have to look it up to know it was later than 1941.)  Jessica Rabbit was a good femme fatale caricature, but somehow just wasn't sexy.  And Roger Rabbit is (as subsequent shorts have shown) a terrible cartoon character - how he could possibly have sustained a career even without a scandal looming over his head is beyond me.Ah, well.  The film was MADE for nit-pickers, or at least for those people who eagerly watch for glimpses of the elusive toon life of 1941.  And creating a short cartoon leading character on demand, as many have said, just can't be done - especially when the art is dead.  Roger Rabbit somehow manages to transcend his limitations and become a good foil for this particular film.Look, it was great. The implications of the living toons were for the most part thought through clearly (contradictions neatly and brazenly ignored). The special effects were fantastic - among the best of all time, up there with '2001', 'Star Wars', 'Jurassic Park'.  And who could turn down the duet between Daffy Duck and Donald Duck?  It clearly ought to have been longer. If need be they could have made time by cutting out the dutiful homage to Mickey Mouse (who had little more to live for in 1941) and Bugs Bunny (who was never very good).  Damn, I'm nit-picking again.  Ignore me.",10,2,4,14 July 1999
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," A new look
","A large part of Disney's triumph cannot be detected by the naked eye.  His last animated film had been `Sleeping Beauty', which was the most extravagant and spectacular animated film of all time (excluding `Fantasia').  It wasn't a financial success.  `101 Dalmatians', much less extravagant, was.  In the two years between `Sleeping Beauty' and its successor there had been a revolution.  The entire army of inkers who had carefully translated animators' pencil drawings into smooth, flowing lines were replaced by a machine that simply photocopied.  This changed the character of animation so much that `Dalmatians' is almost the precise opposite of `Beauty'.  Outlines are rough and black; the entire film looks decidedly drawn rather than painted, even the bits that are in fact painted; and the rich variety of colour of Disney's earlier films has been replaced with the stark white-with-black-spots coat of a dalmatian, with the occasional splash of startling red.  The art directors were as determined to get the most out of the new technology as they had been to get the most out of the old technology. And it has its own quiet extravagance.  A title promising over one hundred spotted dogs was (probably still is) the kind of thing liable to make animators feel faint.  It couldn't have been done without the photocopier; and even so, getting spots to stay in the right place on a featureless white background is a huge headache.  None of this leaps out an audience.  We simply see a hundred adorable dogs.The story is simple, clean, civilised, and warm.  It moves slowly but this doesn't matter.  Preventing the film from becoming lethargic is Cruella de Vil.  She can drive like a maniac through the snow, smoke a cigarette through a holder the length of a sword, wave her arms like a windmill ... yet she handles quiet determination and gritted teeth equally well. Character animation doesn't get any better than this.",8,58,62,15 February 2000
Minority Report," One of the rare, great science fiction movies
","It's an open secret: the Oscar is jinxed.  Spielberg's triumph with 'Schindler's List' was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which was broken with ... 'Jurassic Park II', a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie he's ever directed ('Hook' had its moments).  His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad ('Amistad'), the second bad but not anonymous ('Saving Private Ryan'), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after 'Schindler's List' that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with 'A.I.' in 2001).But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy.  I've even learned to welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance.  I didn't like the voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich, are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better).  Yet, in the end, big deal.  The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future rich, dazzling and believable.  Spielberg is to be particularly congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of 'Blade Runner'.  The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.Here's a measure of how good the movie is: in an interview, Spielberg revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories - and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product. Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to prevent terrorist attacks, for instance).  This is interpretation is strained.  Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue here.  When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, 'It's best not to think of them as human', I was surprised to find myself nodding in agreement.  The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three - just three - individuals.  Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody is asked to give up any freedom at all.  (Except, of course, the freedom to commit murder.  But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder, and a good thing too.)The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the futility of revenge.  After people who would otherwise have committed murder are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they deserve.  But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose.  It's exacting revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is why the future is a realistic one.  (Apart from the precognition, that is.) Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never more admirable than when he realises his mistake.  (THAT was a great scene; it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why.  Suffice it to say that when we think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up in order to obscure the rest of it.)The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances. They're all good.  Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that 'Minority Report' was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to life.",10,138,229,20 June 2002
G.I. Jane," No surprise.
","Ridley Scott is cinema's biggest puzzle since Brian DePalma.  When he makes a bad film critics all voice their disappointment - but what were they expecting?  ALL his films (although I've yet to see 'Gladiator') are bad. They ALL suggest that his best work lies elsewhere, which doesn't make any sense.  Perhaps there's a secret cache of Scott films which only Freemasons know about.So 'G.I. Jane' is precisely what one would expect from the director of the criminally over-rated 'Alien', the tediously worthy 'Blade Runner', the pretty but hollow 'Legend', the lifeless 'Black Rain', the exploitative 'Thelma and Louise' ... I could go on.  There is one difference.  As another viewer has commented all of his other films have some sort of visual sense; 'Legend', for instance, looks spectacular; and even when the cinematography and art direction yield nothing of interest (as in 'Blade Runner'), there's a strong indication that someone was at least TRYING.  The only such indication we get in 'G.I. Jane' is the confused, confusing, positively DEMENTED, editing and camerawork in the final battle.It's a little hard to pick on 'G.I. Jane' for its fascist sentimentality. With but a few exceptions, EVERY American film dealing with the military is like this.  Still, that's no reason to let Scott off the hook; and anyway, his film is worse than most.  The new recruits are so pointlessly tortured, the drill sergeant bellows such complete rubbish, there are so many yes SIR!s, that we might think it's a comedy ... but no, we can tell that Scott's eyes are moist, and he has a catch in his voice.  If the film had been called 'Triumph of the Will', who would have noticed the irony?  There is none.",2,6,12,25 June 2000
Training Day," Good material squandered
","Spoilers follow.We're presented with a choice, between a policeman who's pure but ineffectual, and one who's corrupt but (as the cliché has it) 'gets results'.  I hope everyone will prefer the former.  (I hope, also, that everyone will realise that in real life, the choice is otherwise, and that the most corrupt police forces are also the most inefficient and useless.)Unfortunately, Ethan Hawke's woefully under-described and thin character (the actor does what he can) doesn't have the guts to be pure.  TWICE his superior, who might as well have horns growing out of his forehead, offers him the chance to walk back to his old, honourable, by no means unpleasant job, at no cost or risk, without losing face before any third party - and the fool refuses, for no reason at all that we can see.  We can only presume he doesn't want to appear naïve.  It would only be possible to warm to a man this spineless if we knew something about him.But the key choice he's offered is a bit less obvious.  Only a bit.  Anyone ought to be able to see that everything the narcotics squad does counts for nothing - for less than nothing.  For every drug dealer, large or small, that they put away, another will leap up to take his place.  But the market forces that make this the case do not apply in the case of, say, rape: and when Jake saw a rape about to take place, he had the chance to actually do some good, by dropping whatever shadowy nothingwork Alonzo wanted him to be getting on with and intervene.  He chose to intervene.  (Successfully  - but for some reason he doesn't actually arrest the rapists.  Why not?  Did he require the co-operation of his superior?  Was he merely caving in, once again, to moral pressure?  Are we meant to be able to work this out?)  And it's fitting that his one good deed turns out to be what saved his life - in fact, to have been almost the only thing that COULD have saved his life, given that he didn't have the sense to walk away from the narcotics squad altogether.I liked this touch.  A pity everything that happens after the key scene with the bathtub is just standard revenge rampage wrap-up (so muddled that perhaps I'm being generous in using a word like 'revenge', which implies a goal).  And a pity that everything leading up to the trap in which Jake is caught is just so flat.  Fluid, bold photography, a good sense of rhythm and strong performances can't breathe life into the opening third or the conclusion.  Nor can guns.  But there's real promise and fire in the middle bit.",Null,3,14,16 April 2002
Mulan," Truly great except for ONE thing ...
","The depth of talent at Disney is frightening.  It's interesting the character animation here with that in 'The Prince of Egypt' - no contest at all.  Every character in 'Mulan' is well, brilliantly, perfectly animated, and many great animators at Disney didn't even touch the project.  A writer here who said that the animation 'lacks detail' merely betrays his (her?) ignorance.  One must distinguish between character design and animation: the former is what a still drawing of a character displays, the latter is the art of moving a character around.  The animation was full of detail.  I felt that every one of the 24-per-second frames conveyed something of value. The character design, on the other hand, *was* deliberately simplified, but I don't see how anyone could deny that this approach was both beautiful and fitting; and since everything (backgrounds and effects animation) had the same stylistic simplicity, the characters were more solidly in place than they usually are in animation.(The effects animation was creative and also streets ahead of 'The Prince of Egypt'.  As was the use of computers.  Watch the Great Wall scene closely: you might be able to *deduce* that computers were involved, but you certainly won't feel that they were.  Computer imagery has been misused with ghastly results in everything from 'Aladdin' to 'The Phantom Menace'. Finally someone has it right.)I won't comment on the story - I'm still moved by it, but then I'm a sucker for that kind of thing.  I'll get to my one complaint.  It's not the music. Yes, the music was ultra-1980s with the odd pentatonic scale; but that's not intrinsically worse than being ultra-1990s with the odd pentatonic scale, and it has the advantage that we know immediately the worst about how dated it will sound (less dated than you'd expect).  No: my problem is Eddie Murphy.  He is painfully unfunny and his introduction made me sigh wearily. He doesn't belong here.  I don't have anything against comic relief, but Disney should have trusted their animators to provide it.  When Mushu is funny, it's the animators' doing - and on those occasions the humour is not at odds with the story.That one criticism pains me to make.  Swallowing 'Mulan' whole, Eddie Murphy and all, it's still a fine movie and a reason for optimism about the future of hand-drawn animation.",9,4,6,1 July 1999
Unbreakable," Unbreakable
","At first you get the impression that the artistic success of 'The Sixth Sense' has gone to Shyamalan's head - for the first quarter-hour or more every other shot is pointlessly arty.  The scene on the train is terribly done: camera peering through a gap in the seats, shifting from side to side because it can't get a good view.  Then there's that moment when Elijah is given his first comic, and the camera moves overhead until it is shooting directly down, then swivels 540 degrees in a comic-synchronous position. The very first scene is shot through a mirror for no reason at all.  The pointlessness of these gestures wouldn't matter if they were at all pleasant to look at, but they're not - neither pleasant nor unpleasant, merely pretentious.But when all the scene-setting is out of the way, just when we're near despair, Shyamalan decides to settle down into, and trust, his story, which is a good one.  His earnest cinematic style becomes functional and attractive, just as it was in 'The Sixth Sense' (if not quite to the same degree).  Perhaps this earnest style is the very best thing about the film. Few modern writers and directors are as courageous as Shyamalan: most would be too timid to take their material as seriously as this.If anything it's more cleverly constructed than 'The Sixth Sense'.  The only thing making it an inferior film (apart from the clumsy artiness of the opening) is the fact that the fantasy scenario isn't as interesting or emotionally powerful this time - not that this is anything to be ashamed of. Neither joky, cynical, self-referential nor self-effacing in its desire to entertain... it's a pleasure to watch.",8,0,1,13 July 2001
Fight Club," Hang in there
","I find it incredible how many times I've heard the following comment - and from professional reviewers! -: it begins well, but loses its way in the second half in a welter of violence ...Is it possible to be more wrong?  It's a very good film, but you'd never know it from the beginning.  Opening credits (and first shot): pointlessly hip computer-aided graphics that contribute nothing to story, mood, etc. Music: rock schlock drivel that makes you wonder why they bothered to commission a score at all.  Worst of all, the opening is stuffed to the gills with tacky first-person narration; and after waiting half an hour for the narration to end and the movie to begin, we find that it won't.  The narration won't end, that is.  The movie DOES get underway, but we must first suffer music, editing, the pretentious rubbish spouted by the narrator, and ... well, I suspect that Fincher has defeated his purpose by overloading the screen with gore, because most of us will look away and not see it.Take heart.  The story is a good one, after all, and the film's second half justifies most (but not quite all) of what we had to endure at the beginning.  Reviewers are wrong: there's LESS gratuitous violence towards the end; that is to say, less GRATUITOUS violence, - I wasn't actually counting blows.  How can I put this ...?  The film takes off and soars despite its flaws, and I should know, because I'm well aware of the flaws. It's a pity I can't say any more without spoiling things.Oh, and in case you were worried ... this is no glorification of Tyler Durden, or of any aspect of his character, or of Fight Club.  It's a condemnation.  The film is not to blame if so many people fail to see this.",7,0,2,21 February 2000
Citizen Kane," Certainly ONE of the best
","`Citizen Kane' would be more widely loved, perhaps, if it did not begin with a lengthy newsreel account of Kane's life.  (Actually, it begins with the death scene, and I know there are some who find THIS bizarre and off-putting.  But I doubt that's what turns people off.)  While this is the only part of the film that could be described as dull, I suspect that some viewers don't bother to watch any further, expecting more of the same dated vulgarity.  But a newsreel is a newsreel.  Everyone knew they were vulgar and intolerably pompous, even when they were being made - ESPECIALLY when they were being made - and it's just this vulgarity and pomposity that the rest of the film undermines, in the lively account that follows of what Kane's life was REALLY like.  After the newsreel it's one great scene after another.  `Citizen Kane' is anything but worthy stodge.But presenting us with the newsreel, mind you, was a good tactic.  Forget the `Rosebud' thing.  The real story is that of the reporter who researches above and beyond the call of duty, cross-examining witness after witness, in search of enough `human interest' detail to make more sense of Kane's life than the newsreel did - and he can never find quite enough.  The amazing thing is that Welles plays perfectly fair.  He hides from us the identity of `Rosebud', but nothing else; and in playing Kane he makes no effort to conceal what Kane is thinks or feels.  Yet we share the reporter's perplexity at the end.  Welles performed one of the world's great conjuring tricks when he told us every important detail EXCEPT the identity of `Rosebud', and then sprung that information on us, as well, to see if it made a difference.  See for yourself if it does.",10,6,9,27 August 1999
The Birth of a Nation," Historical interest is the next thing to a yawn
","Judged on the basis of this film alone - which would not, of course, be fair - D.W. Griffith shows no signs of being a great director.  He may have been a pioneering director, but that's not the same thing.The techniques on display in 'Birth of a Nation' don't show a lot of promise, anyway.  The one modern audiences will immediately notice is tinting (battle scenes are red, domestic scenes are sepia, etc.).  But although monochrome remained the industry default for about thirty years after the first appearance of three-strip technicolor (in 1932), tinting had completely vanished by 1930 or so - because, however fashionable it may have once been, it's a lousy technique.  Griffith's trick of drawing our attention to something by blacking out the rest of the screen - destroying the sense of frame on which cinema depends - also deservedly vanished from the common repertoire.  (Not that it was used to much effect.)  And while Griffith may have 'invented' the close-up (between you and me, he didn't), his meagre use of them in this particular film doesn't prevent the work from being uncomfortably stagy.I stress again that it would be unfair to judge Griffith from this film alone.  I haven't seen his later work; no doubt he improved.  But it would be ridiculous to give him a reputation by making allowances for the fact that he lacked the technical and cultural resources that were around a generation or so later.  You might as well call W.S. Gilbert a great director, or Charles Dickens - very likely they, too, could have made good films if they'd had the resources.  Let's keep the debate above board and judge by actual results. ...My remarks above refer to part one, which wasn't, exactly, BADLY made, and at least pleasant to watch.  But part two makes up for this.  Yes, I know a work can be morally evil and aesthetically great, and racism needn't be an artistic flaw.  But sometimes it IS an artistic flaw - for instance, here.  Does the blatant racism of the second half weaken the characterisation?  YES.  Does it make the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys seem hopelessly contrived?  Yes.  Do we get the curious feeling that we're watching cartoon blacks pasted on top of a photo-realistic painting?  Yes again.  This is all quite apart from the fact that Griffith (unlike Tolkein in 'The Lord of the Rings', who exhibits artistically justified racism towards orcs) purports to tell a more-or-less true story about the real world.There's a difference between learning to respect conventions that are different from later ones, and learning to respect conventions that are inferior to later ones.  'The Birth of a Nation' demands that we do the latter - with regard to both moral AND cinematic conventions.  We can only regard it as a great work of art by being dishonest with ourselves.  An epic like 'Metropolis' belongs in cinemas; 'The Birth of a Nation' belongs in a museum.",6,1,5,29 November 2001
Memento," Nothing much to say - I just want to add another voice to the general chorus of praise.
","The year 2000 produced, so far as I can tell, just three flawless gems; this is one of them.  The narrative device is the kind of flashy gimmick writers dream about being able to use properly: the story is divided into lots and lots of very very small chapters - each chapter connecting directly to the next - and we are given these chapters backwards, last to first.  (Yes, I know it's not as classically simple as that - there's also the black-and-white footage.  But this serves the function of expository narrative; it isn't a chapter in its own right.)  It's amazing that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the umpteen transitions back in time works dramatically, and that the story makes far more sense this way, and is easier to follow, than it would told chronologically.  So perfectly cast is the narrative that it's impossible to tell which idea came first, the technical challenge of telling the story backwards, or the exceedingly clever story that justifies this conceit.We open watching a killing in an abandoned building and the puzzle is how we got there.  That's ALL the puzzle is.  The film won't even tell us, until the end (beginning) whether this is a whodunnit, a Thorndyke-like police procedural, a gestalt-shift exercise, or something else.  The protagonist, who has no long-term memory, is precisely as lost as we are; the only thread that feels secure to him when he tugs on it is the knowledge that he's out to avenge the death of his wife - and he seeks revenge mainly because he's left himself little notes he's left for telling him to.  So good to see a Hollywood movie willing to make fun of the very idea of revenge, although this is a minor virtue of a very rich work.",9,0,2,20 November 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Let down badly by the words, enriched by the images
","Alfred Hitchcock used to say that the sight of people in Paris (or Moscow, or Kefallonia) talking amongst themselves in English, was all by itself enough to ruin a movie.  Okay, so Hitchcock was a bit loopy.  But such things can happen.  The way everyone in 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' speaks English - the Greeks with a Greek accent, the Italians with an Italian accent, the Germans with a German accent, the BBC newsman with a BBC accent - seriously undermines the credibility of every scene, and brings outright idiocies in its wake.  It's fair enough, sometimes, to let English stand in for some other language.  But EVERY other language?  Details are obscured: is Captain Corelli bilingual, trilingual (he converses with Germans, but in what tongue? this is an important issue), or can he only speak Italian?  How many languages can the average islander speak?  How many languages can the average Italian private speak?  Is there an accepted lingua franca on the island, and if so, what is it?  It's as if everyone is speaking not Italian or Greek or German but European, a language with slightly different regional variants.  Every single person we see speaks this English-as-a-second-language with precisely the same degree of  proficiency - although Nicholas Cage will every so often utter a word like 'signora' or 'bella', to confuse matters further.So the absence of subtitled Greek, Italian etc. is a real problem, accounting for all that is seriously wrong with the film - ALL that is seriously wrong, mind you, which is why I resent people talking about the film as though it were a disaster (those who have acquired an irrational hatred of Miramax are especially fond of doing so), when it is at worst a pleasant outing, with much to recommend it.  Cinematography is gorgeous. The island is gorgeous.  People look as though they really live there. (John Tool's photography is EXACTLY the kind of thing Peter Jackson ought to have tried for when he made 'The Fellowship of the Ring'.  The fact that the latter was showered with praise and awards while the former merely got a few half-hearted compliments shows just how little respect Tolkeinesque fantasy is accorded.  People EXPECT a World War Two story set on a Greek island to look superb.  With fantasy, we're delighted if only it fails to look embarrassingly bad, sometimes even if it doesn't.  But I digress.)  There are one or two - okay, considerably more than one or two - lines that are just too obvious and pat, but usually contained within scenes that are somehow strong enough to bear them.  The story as a whole is an engaging one.  The bit with the sea mine is surely worthwhile.No worse than mediocre in other respects, it's worth seeing simply because it's worth SEEING.",8,3,6,30 April 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Sigh. About the Oscar...
","Obviously it would have been more just to give the Best Picture award to 'Life is Beautiful', but I'm in two minds as to whether or not this would have been a good thing.  Foreign language films have always been implicitly disqualified from being declared Best Picture, so much so that they have their own special category - so why not be honest and disqualify them explicitly?So let's rule 'Life is Beautiful' out.  GIVEN the remaining nominees ('Elizabeth', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Thin Red Line'), I don't see how anyone could deny that 'Shakespeare in Love' was at least a plausible choice.  Some people are understandably upset that Miramax 'bought' the award, by advertising heavily, but this has been going on for decades - and at least Miramax had the grace to keep its advertising out of the film itself, unlike certain other entrants I could mention.  This is a film that was made first and entered into competition afterwards.  There's not a trace of pomposity about it, not a single character pointing out to us, for the benefit of the judges, that the script is profound.  Grandiloquent posturing has often won in the past ('Dances with Wolves', 'Unforgiven', 'Forrest Gump'), and I'm rather pleased that, at least this once, it didn't.  I'm also pleased that the award went to, loosely speaking, a comedy.  THAT hadn't happened for 21 years, and I'm not sure it will ever happen again.Anyway, I don't see how it could be that there are people who actually RESENT a film so beautiful, charming, and intelligent.  Granted, it tells us nothing about how Shakespeare created his plays, but how could it?  And would it be cinematically interesting even if it could?  I doubt it. 'Topsy-Turvy' (possibly the best picture of 1999, by the way, and not even nominated) went into the nuts and bolts of staging a theatrical work in greater and more loving detail than any other film I've seen, but on the topic of primary creation - how Gilbert came up with his words, how Sullivan came up with his notes - it was silent.  What was there to say?'Shakespeare in Love' is more concerned with what Shakespeare has in common with everyone else, and also what he has in common with other artists - even the untalented ones.  That it's not a serious historical account is established by the working title it offers of 'Romeo and Juliet' - 'Romeo and Ethyl, the Pirate's Daughter'.  (It's a joke straight out of 'Blackadder'.)  The point is that we see a plausible picture of a genius living and breathing, which he does the same way everyone else does.By the way, if you want to see Geoffrey Rush at his best, in his best role, this is it.  He's perfect in his small role of eccentric theatre manager (although he fails to steal any scenes from more capable performers like Judi Dench, Joseph Fiennes, Colin Firth...).  He should stick to this kind of thing.  There is, as everyone has noticed, a distinct shortage of good character actors.",10,0,1,15 December 2001
12 Monkeys," Consistent time travel!
","Consistent AND clever.  All too often a writer or film-maker will make it over the first hurdle only to crash into the second.  But consistency in a time travel story is rare enough, and I remember the delighted purring made by people I knew who saw the film and found that it didn't take them for fools.I haven't seen `La Jetée', so I can't say how much brilliance `Twelve Monkeys' owes to the earlier, shorter work.  There are conflicting accounts. Presumably Gilliam's version adds SOMETHING to the tale.  It's much longer, and none of the time is wasted.If you've heard that this is the story of a time traveller who reports that he comes from the future and is locked away in an asylum as a result, and if this makes you sigh wearily and reach for something else - I know exactly how you feel.  But you've got it all wrong.  The action does NOT get bogged down in the loony bin; the story is NOT your standard `I'm sane, I tell you - saaane!' chestnut; indeed, the film cracks the chestnut to give a satisfying surprise to everyone like me who hates that sort of thing.Don't be put off, either, if you're one of those people who finds Gilliam's visual ticks (beneath-the-nostrils close-ups, stupid tilting camera) irritating.  Again, I do too, but there aren't so many of them in `Twelve Monkeys'; and anyway, they aren't a problem.  The film looks great.  Visual imagination lifts rather than detracts from the story.  And it really is such a neat story.There's more to praise but other writers can handle that.  If there's a better science fiction film from the 1990s I've yet to see it - which isn't saying THAT much, since there's a fair few I haven't seen; but it's saying something.",10,1,2,13 February 2000
Mississippi Burning," Vile, but not for the reasons its detractors advance
","Well, 'Mississippi Burning' can be acquitted on one charge, at least - it doesn't glorify the FBI, which, as an organisation, did all it could to hamper the civil rights movement.  The heroes are two agents assigned to cover a particular case.  They may or may not be in sympathy with the organisation to which they belong; my guess is that they aren't.  There's certainly something curious about making the heroes of this particular story white FBI agents, but this isn't in itself objectionable - at least, not under the circumstances.But the film is still morally repulsive, for reasons that it worries me that no-one has pointed out.  When Anderson and Ward travel to Mississippi to investigate the murder of civil rights activists, they run into a stone wall.  Whites are too bigoted to talk to them and blacks are too terrified of reprisals.  If they charge a white man with a crime of violence they know that no local jury will convict and no local judge will sentence.  What can they do?They try for prosecution in a federal court, obviously - so far, so good. And to make absolutely certain that their charges stick they play dirty: they recruit thugs and extract information under torture and the threat of extreme violence.  If there's a single character whose actions we're meant to approve of, it's Anderson (invested with all the charm Gene Hackman has to offer) - and we see him wielding a razor blade, threatening to slash someone's throat.  He's not, in this scene, seriously attempting to find anything out, or even trying to coerce his victim into cooperating.  It's a mere display of strength and will.  When I first saw 'Mississippi Burning' I was so infuriated by the racism that I managed to persuade myself (reluctantly, I hope) to cheer him on.  I was nearly sixteen.  I'm glad I don't have to admit to having been any older.  Looking at the movie today, the fascist nastiness which I had talked myself into overlooking turns out to be the dominant element.",5,7,13,4 April 2002
The 13th Warrior," A qualified success
","I have two nice things to say.  Possibly more.(1)  I loved every minute of the Norse atmospherics.  We really get a sense of ... well, everything we're meant to get a sense of: damp greenness, a village barely clinging on to existence on the very edge of the civilised world, pure cold wilderness on every side, clear air, rustic grandeur, and an immense amount of wood.  Location shooting is rarely this good.  I gather we're looking at Canada rather than Scandinavia, but (a) who cares, it's the result that counts, and (b) it's obvious that a lot of work, and thought, and of course wood, went into the creation of the village: it might as well be the real thing.(2)  Only once or twice have I seen sheer physical courage so convincingly portrayed.  It's clear that each Viking is willing to risk his life - or, even more impressively, extreme pain - without hesitating for a moment, and without fear making a difference one way or the other; and this comes across as genuine bravery, rather than cartoon heroics.  It's not easy to make characters so remarkably brave without giving the impression that the laws of human motivation have been suspended, and that therefore they're not brave at all.  'The Thirteenth Warrior' certainly succeeds.(1) and (2) are reason enough to see the movie, and to prevent it, whatever flaws it may have, from being bad.  The story isn't bad, either.  (The most that can be said against it is that it's simple and unremarkable.)  Yet the film as a whole is less than a complete success.  I'm not sure why.  Others criticise the editing, and indeed it is a bit over-chopped, but much less so than, say, 'Gladiator'.  Maybe we don't get enough of a look at any one character.  The Arab would be an obvious one to sketch in greater detail.  I think the soft-focus, soft-light look of the opening scenes was a fairly serious mistake.  Remember, the story is told from the Arab's point of view; and Arabia is, so far as he is concerned, the MOST solid and detailed and real place in the universe.  It simply doesn't make sense to show us his homeland through a dreamlike haze.And I feel another serious mistake has been made in depicting the evil that threatens the Northern village.  When we find out more about it, it becomes far too science-fictiony; the wonderful flavour is lost.  This, rather than poor editing or under-characterisation, is what makes the conclusion less than satisfying.Still, this matters less than you might suppose, in the face of (1) and (2).",8,2,3,4 February 2001
12 Angry Men," Gets everything right that matters
","Here's an illustration of the difference between theatre and cinema.  This is the definitive cinematic 'performance' of Reginald Rose's play; the one or two trivial flaws are of no consequence whatever.  On the stage, they WOULD be of consequence.  As E.G. Marshall performs the role, Juror nr. 4 is so humourless and anal that you start to wonder if he's really all that bright (and the story requires that he really IS all that bright).  And Henry Fonda tends to play Juror nr. 8 from moment to moment, in effect contradicting himself (if you find yourself failing to warm to him as much as you should, this is the reason).  THE two key performances, in short, are weak.  On stage this would be fatal.  On the other hand, with STRONG performances all round, '12 Angry Men' on the stage could not possibly go wrong, however much the director takes it upon himself to stuff things up - just as the stage director of 'Don Giovanni' can make a donkey of himself by setting the action in present-day Darlinghurst, if he likes, and, with sufficiently good musical performances, the opera will not be harmed.If you exclude Ed Wood movies and the like, '12 Angry Men' was shot with as much economy as any other film in history, with roughly HALF of the exposed footage making it into the final cut (I find this hard to believe, too, but it's what the director says, and it's not inherently impossible).  No doubt accounts for the odd touch of unpolished acting here and there.  What's amazing is how perfectly Lumet has paced the action, how RIGHT each shot is.Lumet conveys the confined space all the more effectively by including thirty seconds, perhaps a minute of footage of the outside: the opening shot where we track into the jury room, and the closing shot in the open air outside.  These moments - which established there was a wider world while cutting the jury room off from it - were crucial.",9,0,1,1 July 2002
Beauty and the Beast," Gorgeous, moving film
","When Walt Disney chose as a fairytale the subject for his first animated feature: `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.  The result was first screened in 1937.  He revisited fairytales with `Cinderella', in 1950, and `Sleeping Beauty', in 1959.  He never made another.  Nor did his studio, until the release of `Beauty and the Beast', in 1991.It's odd: because the fairytales Disney chose are poor ones, and the films I just mentioned are of value mainly because of the valiant way they overcome the limits imposed by their subject matter - and they don't always do so. The story of Beauty and the Beast, on the other hand, is one of the most beautiful folktales around.  Somehow the studio managed to avoid it for fifty-four years.  Perhaps it's a good thing they waited.  `Beauty and the Beast' is a triumph, almost on the same level as the great films made in Disney's heyday (up to 1942), and considerably better than `Snow White'.It's hard to say what makes it so good.  It's just a touching love story with neither cloying sentimentality nor jarring irony.  The animation is mostly very good - and the animation (and character design) of the Beast, the most important character, is inspired.  Trousdale and Wise pace and shape the story in exactly the right way, adding detail to the original where necessary, leaving the heart of it unaltered.  The occasional clumsiness is more than made up for by sheer sincerity.  For the most part it's anything but clumsy.",10,1,1,23 August 1999
Bloody Sunday," Bloody good, and made me bloody angry, despite the bloody awful cinematography
","You apprehend an armed man, who admits to being a professional bank robber, outside a bank. Inside the bank three people lie badly wounded on the floor. The bank robber blames the victims for their injuries, and (perhaps as an afterthought) also blames others standing in the queue; he says they started the violence. The victims blame the bank robber. Only if you were so feeble-minded as to have no ability to process evidence at all would you subject the two claims to an equal amount of scepticism. Anyone interested in arriving at the truth would be biased against the bank robber. Yes, it's not impossible that he's telling the truth; it's possible that the victims ARE to blame for their own injuries. But the burden of proof rests with him, with the man who walked into the bank carrying a rifle.The following is public knowledge, known to people who weren't there and not denied even by the British army: The organisers of the march urged the people taking part not to resort to violence, however much provoked. They certainly didn't arm the marchers themselves. The officers of the army DID arm its soldiers, with powerful rifles, tear gas cannisters, heavy artillery and tanks. Moreover they did NOT forswear violence, even in the statements they made for the benefit of the press: on the contrary, they announced their willingness to use their weapons in retaliation; not just in self-defence, mind you, but in retaliation. That journalists could sit through a press conference in which Major-General Ford says, as a message to the organisers of the march: 'Any violence that may result rests squarely on your shoulders,' without snorting derisively, is surprising however much mainstream coverage you've seen of the recent attack on Iraq.Greengrass has made a fictional recreation of an actual event and obviously he's had to fill in details. (Obviously, no outsider could possibly know for sure what Cooper said to his girlfriend in the privacy of his own home the morning before the march, etc.) But he's been exraordinarily careful, so far as I can tell, to fill in details in the most plausible way he can; only two or three times does anyone so much as utter a single line of dialogue that strikes me as unlikely (a line that sounds as though it may have been inserted for the purpose of exposition), and even then, not much. Not often, but sometimes, Greengrass has to choose between two conflictng accounts of what happened. If he doesn't do so he doesn't have a film. So he chooses whichever is most likely, which of course makes him biased; that is to say, a rational creature, and not a kind of walking dictaphone incapable of distinguishing between truth and falsehood.Obviously I wouldn't be going to so much trouble to defend the film on this one point if I didn't also think it was good. It's a powerful and convincing account of a day gone wrong... a single day, with a couple of days' background, which is why people who accuse it of being a one-sided account of the conflict in Northern Ireland are also wrong: you either know or you don't why the protestors are marching, and the film doesn't include any forced exposition to try to cue in people who don't know. And while the film hints at what's likely to happen next, as a result of the violence, it doesn't include or pretend to include that story, either. I like a film that knows what it's about and what it's not about.The cinematography is, alas, awful. What is Greengrass trying to do with all this needless, eye-watering camera-shaking - forge documentary footage? Only if he's a bigger fool than he could possibly be given the script he's written. He shows private domestic scenes no cameraman would be allowed to film, then wobbles the camera as though to remind us that there is a cameraman present, and an inept one, too, when in the world of the fiction, there isn't; and even outside the world of the fiction, one hopes that the cameraman isn't really as inept as he's pretending to be, although there's no direct visual evidence to the contrary. There's no excuse for such riding-over-a-cattle-grid photography. Nor is there an excuse for such horrible, dour, bluish-grey colour processing, the kind that announces to the audience, 'I wanted to shoot in black and white, but they wouldn't let me.'Don't suppose for a minute that any of this HELPS the film. But the script, and Greengrasss sureity of purpose, are enough to ensure that it does little or no harm. We're taken completely inside the story despite (certainly not because of) the photography, and given the nature of what we watch... well, anger directed at the guy behind the camera seems misplaced.",Null,3,14,6 June 2003
The Fifth Element," The kind of tripe that passes for a feast these days
","So this is what the art of visual spectacle has come to.  'Fantasia' (1940), 'Black Narcissus' (1947), '2001' (1968), 'Star Wars' (1977) - I could add many other examples - were all thrilling in various ways.  'The Fifth Element' merely induces a headache.  I'll give Besson his due for having the right kind of general idea.  He wants to give us a guided tour of the rainbow, and he has a good deal of success, in individual scenes.  He knows that computers alone won't do the trick.  The perfect lighting combines with set and costume design to serve up some lovely colour-cocktails: president's purple throne room, the villain standing in a corridor of weed-tinted green, the blue soprano singing in front of a dark indigo arches framing a ripe blue planet.  But it doesn't always work.  Sometimes Besson's sense of colour fails him and the result is a mess.  And apart from his sense of colour he has nothing to fall back on.  The design of the future - it's all visual design - is mostly a compendium of clichés, mixed in with a souped-up vision of the 1990s: an empty, hip, MTV flashiness.  Some of the computer images work, but most of them - the traffic shots in particular - feature the kind of cheesy rendering and animation that will forever be the industry standard, if we're not careful.Hipness - that's Besson's guiding star.  He doesn't even care what his film looks like so long as he can convince us that he's up-to-the-minute and with it.  I suppose that's why the action sequences are all underscored (and undercut) by ghastly techno-trash for which, as is so often the case, Eric Serra is to blame.Apart from the look and the feel there's nothing to talk about without being overcome by deep weariness.  The plot isn't hard to understand.  At least, it's as easy to understand on the first viewing as it's ever going to get. It will never make any sense.  Here's the central idea: once every five thousand years comes a great evil that will destroy all life, ALL life, if a magic ceremony isn't performed.  The villain wants to stop the ceremony from being performed.  The phrase 'obscure motivation' doesn't even begin to describe this situation.  Does the villain want to die?  No.  Is he acting in ignorance?  No.  Is there ANY way of making sense of his psychology? No.If Besson had been content with a simple high-wire act of implausibility, if he'd been willing to let his central conceit rest unexplained, it MIGHT have worked.  But he tries to explain things and makes matters worse.  He can't even come up with some decent sophistry.  Watch the first confrontation between the priest and the villain while bearing in mind that both players know that the future of all life is at stake.  The advanced student who can salvage some kind of point from this scene should then turn his attention to the mysterious actions performed by the priest (a different priest) in the opening scene.  It's no use: there's no making sense of any of it.So far I've been kind.  It's despicable as well as bad.  Anything so soulless, that tries so hard to be hip and cynical, has no RIGHT to attempt such blatant emotional manipulation at the end.",6,2,4,13 February 2000
The Great Dictator," The comments, for what they're worth, of one who has not seen Chaplin's silent films
","Charlie Chaplin and Adolf Hitler, for reasons best known to themselves, DID elect to wear the same paintbrush moustache, and it was only a matter of time before someone made use of this coincidence somehow.  Luckily it was Chaplin himself.Oddly enough, Chaplin plays a Jew who happens to have the same moustache as the Great Dictator, and it's only a matter of time before someone makes use of this coincidence somehow ...The story gets put on hold every so often with comic set pieces that make it clear why Chaplin was so highly regarded.  The penny-swallowing scene and the bit set to Brahms's fourth Hungarian Dance are hilarious and more than hilarious - agile and beautiful as well.  (On the other hand, the globe scene, which I'm surprised to see people rave about, goes on forever.)  Yet the story - or at any rate the basic situation - is still interesting enough to hold things together.  The central character is the most reluctant of reluctant heroes.  In a word, he's a coward.  He HAS no hidden reserves of courage to draw upon when he needs them.  But somehow he rises to the occasion anyway.As a satire of Nazi Germany it's inevitably lacking, constrained in a hundred ways by the political conditions of, and lack of hindsight available in, the year in which it was made.  The speech at the end is all very well but the content doesn't seem quite right today.  (It would be more fittingly directed against Stalin than Hitler.)  A partial misfire - but triumphantly great in places.",9,1,3,7 August 1999
The Mummy," May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the computers of ILM
","Okay, so it wasn't a horror movie.  GOOD.  Why would anyone want to inspire horror?  Lust, pity, fear, joy, excitement, fascination, anxiety ... I can see the point of arousing THOSE psychological states, but what's so great about nausea and repulsion?  Horror, indeed.I must admit `The Mummy' doesn't arouse much lust, pity, fear, et cetera, either; moreover, it's stupid, which is more of a problem when the early scenes promise a minimal level of intelligence that the rest of the film fails to deliver.  (I have little patience with the turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy crowd.  Anyone who would voluntarily turn off his brain deserves the consequences, including not remembering to turn it on again afterwards.)How stupid is it?  Well ...  The desert between Hamunaptra and Cairo is crossed several times, sometimes with camels, sometimes without - and, of course, Sommers forgets which side of the desert he left the camels on. Hamunaptra was built so that the Pharaoh, by pulling a lever, could pull the entire city underground.  But why is the lever smack bang in the MIDDLE of the city?  What good was it to anyone there?And so on.All the same, I recommend it.  It's not as stupid as it looks.  Before the mummy awakes it's reasonably consistent, reasonably well written, and, most importantly in this kind of desert-fermented cheese, it looks and feels good.  There's sand, there's Egyptian stuff all over the place, there's burnished gold, there's high priests ... it all satisfies a deep human need. We don't see nearly enough of the paraphernalia of the Ancient World on the screen.  Even Rome went out of fashion decades ago.  (Why, I wonder?)  So all in all I'm glad `The Mummy' exists.  It's not the best of its kind, but at least it's there.  And it's not just the content of the imagery.  The sunny wide-screen photography really is first class.That is, until some fool steps in and plasters computer-generated images over the top.  By Thoth they look awful.  A computer-generated plague of flies is no improvement at all on sprinkling pepper over the negatives; the decaying mummies themselves seem to be knitted out of a kind of featureless grey wool; the scarabs look like they escaped from `Toy Story'; and that quicksilver (or whatever it was) is such a hoary and ineffective old computer effect that a group of friends can spend an entertaining couple of hours compiling a list of all the movies that feature it.  What is it with these computer-generated effects?  Are directors these days even ALLOWED to make movies without them?  Is there a law I don't know about?Grump, grump, grump.  Anyway, even taking THIS into account, I enjoyed the movie.  I liked it so very much that I wish I could have respected it as well.",8,1,2,1 November 1999
The Others," A superb ghost story
","SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD.  If you haven't seen the film don't read so much as a single word below. ...As with 'The Sixth Sense', I believe you're MEANT to guess halfway through. When Grace meets her husband it's a 'Vertigo' gesture: we now know the central truth that's eluding the main characters, they don't, and the tension comes from us waiting for them to find out.  Anyway, it's not as if the series of broad hints we are dropped during Grace's walk in the woods reveal ALL secrets, or clear up all mysteries.  We weren't told at that point that the caretakers are also dead, or that Grace murdered her own children, although the film plays fair with us and tells us all we need to know to work these things out.The list of clues I failed to see the significance of at once is an embarrassingly long one (although the chagrin was pleasant): the undelivered letter, the mysterious departure of the servants, the day that 'mummy went mad', the fact that Lydia underwent some trauma that rendered her mute... But in addition to all these clues there's one EXTERNAL to the narrative, a matter of technique, which I failed to read correctly even though I saw it mentioned before I saw the film, and noted it while watching.It was in a review by New York critic Godfrey Cheshire.  It wasn't favourable.  An essential component of the haunted-house story, Cheshire argues, is 'daylight reality', which means that in order for the spookiness to work we MUST see the people who are about to be haunted doing ordinary things in broad, unthreatening daylight.  And he's right: 'daylight reality' IS an essential component of any story of this kind.So when the film opens with Grace emerging from a nightmare, breathless with terror, in a dark house surrounded by fog, it DOES appear to be a stylistic defect.  But it isn't.  Grace, it will eventually turn out, is a ghost, a haunter rather than a hauntee.  'Very well,' I thought to myself when I discovered this, 'but what about the caretakers?  Why don't we see THEIR daylight reality?'  The answer to this question is the same: because they, too, are ghosts (you think by this stage I'd have got it).  Not until the very end, when we meet the 'others', does the sun come out.  This hard-won 'daylight reality' is no less effective a part of the ghost story for coming last rather than first.",9,0,0,12 March 2002
Dead Poets Society," Why this movie is NOT another bad Robin Williams showcase
","Robin Williams has played a doctor, another doctor, a disk jockey, a toymaker, a loony scientist, and so on through a long list - each character somehow different from everyone else in his profession, each with a certain something that makes everyone else adore him, each obviously in possession of a huge ego, each given an opportunity to do some Robin Williams schtick, each determined to steal the movie at all costs.  He's like that here, too. So what's the difference?It's fourfold:(1)  Peter Weir is far from being my favourite director - he's capable of pretentious turkeys like 'Picnic at Hanging Rock', for one thing - but he's not a hack.  Weir makes it worth watching in a number of ways other than those mentioned below.(2)  If you see through the Cult of Williams and notice things which escape its adherents (Keating really IS a poor English teacher; the chapter he urges his students to tear out of their books is saying perfectly sensible things and at any rate, it's a strange thing to tell them to do under the guise of getting them to 'think for themselves'; the hero-worship the students indulge in IS disturbing and unhealthy), it doesn't matter.  The central story concerns the student Neil and how he acquires moral courage. It works as a story whatever attitude we take or ought to take towards Mr. Keating.  The film is NOT just , 'Why Robin Williams is right and everyone else is wrong.'(3)  The villains ... actually, there aren't really any villains, and of the teachers who oppose Mr. Keating, one, at least, is both sensible and sympathetic.  Robin Williams has true counterweights.(4)  Robin Williams does not sweep all before him in a wave of triumph. What triumph there is muted and limited in scope.  Trust me: that's exactly what you want in this movie.  The last thing you want to see is the Cult of Keating taking over the world.'Dead Poets Society' is a fine movie so long as not too much is claimed for it.  To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw: if you're under sixteen when you first see this movie and you don't feel that it will change your life, you have no heart; if you're over sixteen when you see it and you still feel that it will change your life, you have no head.I was sixteen exactly.  That lets me off the hook.",7,0,1,9 August 1999
Chicken Run," Clever, warm, and, despite the involvement of Dreamworks, Yorkshirish
","I must admit, my heart sank for a few seconds when Rocky opened his mouth and punctured the North English atmosphere with his American accent.  Was it true, after all?  Had Aardman traded its soul for an American audience?No, it hadn't.  The film got better, not worse, after Rocky's entrance (neither because nor in spite of him, I think); it became more, not less, true to itself.  It's probably the best Aardman work so far; better even than 'A Close Shave', which it somewhat resembles - it's better because it's longer and more ambitious, yet scarcely puts a foot wrong.  The understated, lovably daft characters are similar to those of the Wallace-and-Gromit world, but they're more than mere copies.  The rat duo was an inspired creation; and Ginger is an endearing chicken indeed.Every aspect of the art direction is excellent.  If you've made allowances for the story's perfect construction, and the wit, and you still think the film is more exhilarating than it ought to be, you've probably forgotten the cumulative effect of such flawless visual world-spinning.  Why does anyone bother making computer-animated films, when this kind of thing is possible? Taken together, 'Chicken Run' and 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' - very different in style - form a decisive refutation of computer animation.  The world of 'Toy Story', to which the computer style is ideally suited, doesn't have half the richness or solidity of 'Chicken Run' or 'Nightmare'; and one can't help thinking how much better 'A Bug's Life' would have been if it had been made in stop-motion.  -It couldn't have been as good as this, though.",10,0,0,28 December 2000
The Hustler," Another rave
","Part of me thought that black and white Cinemascope was a good idea - in general it's not a BAD idea, given Cinemascope - and part of me thought that Robert Rossen needed his head examined.  The film is about a POOL hustler. All those coloured balls moving around at key moments, and he goes and shoot in black and white!  Not that the camera ever really focuses on the pool table; and, to be sure, the camera's casual attitude to the game itself feels surprisingly apt.  Anyway, it's a bit rich MY complaining.  I didn't do my homework.  I know only vaguely the difference between pool and billiards - although I'm still not sure what constitutes success in the latter - and I wouldn't have a clue how either of them differs from snooker. For all I know pool IS snooker, under another name.  I don't think my ignorance was a problem.  'The Hustler' offers a satisfying story told at a satisfying length: two and a quarter hours spent on a simple fable, yet the narrative looks and feels pared to the bone.  It's amazing what some people can draw with a minimum of line.  Take the scene where Eddie meets Sarah for the first time (although I could have chosen almost any scene) - so little is said and yet the lines are perfectly placed just so, giving us a sketch full of detail.  With this kind of perfection it's impossible to know whether to credit the acting, the script, the direction, or all three - not that it matters.",9,3,4,2 August 2000
The Jungle Book," Superb character animation
","The tiger, the panther, the snake and the orang-utan may be the best animated animals the screen has seen - and the bear isn't bad, either.  In a way it's the last great fling of Disney's old veteran animators.  (Most of them were still some distance from retirement, but never again did they fire so magnificently, all at once.)  Anyone who appreciates fine character animation HAS to see this.  Despite the rough outlines favoured by Wolfgang Reitherman (he presided over some extreme cheese-paring after Walt Disney's death), there's also a sumptuous feel to this film, at least while they stay in the jungle.The lack of a story is a problem.  'Flabby' is the word that comes to mind. It's really just the story of Baloo and Mowgli bumming around in the jungle. Now and then something happens.  At one point Mowgli is pinched by some monkeys, and taken to some old ruins, just so that the orang-utan can stage a musical number.  It's a pretty good musical number - did I mention that the orang-utan is skillfully animated? - but that doesn't disguise the fact that it's unmotivated.  After enough running time has passed the incidents stop and the film ends.It's enjoyable enough, and worth seeing for visual reasons, but be warned.",7,3,7,19 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," For a bad film, very good indeed
","It's better for a film to have good art direction than a good cast.  Not that I want to begin by complaining about the cast.  It's always a delight to lay eyes on Christina Ricci, all the old codgers of the town are very well done, and Johnny Depp is more or less tolerable role that appears to have been written with Rowan Atkinson in mind (it's a pity he wasn't available).  But a good cast can't rescue a bad script, whereas good art direction, to some degree, can.  And, to some degree, it does.  This is a gorgeous, amazingly CONSISTENT looking film.  Sleepy Hollow is not so much a town as a world.  And the woods outside, and New York itself, belong to the very same world.  There are one or two neat cinematic ideas: the two girls with the twigs, Christina Ricci's ambiguous white cloak ... actually, that's just two, but I wasn't taking notes.But, too be honest, the visual ideas aren't THAT great.  Look at this work next to a REAL masterwork of design and the difference is at once apparent. Many of Burton's images don't even justify themselves, let alone the narrative digressions they necessitate - such as the laboured, overwrought and irrelevant whodunnit.  There's a limit, after all, to how many people can die in the attempt to prevent further deaths before it all becomes just too ridiculous, and that point is passed after an hour or so, with half the village still to die.  I don't think I've ever seen so many corpses in a detective story.  Furthermore the explanation given for Ichabod's so-called obsessions is the usual kind of childhood-rooted psycho-analytical rubbish, put in because the writers read somewhere that characters need `motivation' and didn't realise that THIS kind of motivation reduces a flesh-and-blood character to the status of a simple wind-up toy.  All that guff about the poverty of reason which WE must endure because of Ichabod's childhood trauma is predicably trite.  Basically this a confused film, at war with itself in too many ways for me to tell you them all.  Let a single instance suffice. After all of Burton's effort and guile has given us a good Headless Horseman, he becomes just another guy on a horse in the chase scene towards the end.  Ichabod actually pinches his horse! and a black denizen of Hell suddenly becomes as alarming as a spare bicycle.I wasn't kidding earlier when I said that the poor script is - to a degree - rescued by art direction.  It's refreshing to see a really-well crafted fantasy world, one that isn't just our own world in disguise.  Of course it matters that what HAPPENS in this world isn't worth recounting, but strangely it doesn't matter as much as you might think.",7,0,0,28 May 2000
We Were Soldiers," If you're watching this movie with someone, and his or her eyes start to mist over, edge away slowly
","This is a Coca-Cola ad of a film.  It's about nothing, it affirms nothing, it denies nothing, it scarcely even hints at anything; the pointlessness of all the footage, considered as a whole, is as mystifying as the footage of a skydiver jumping out of a plane on a surfboard and then drinking Coca-Cola when he lands.  Yet one is somehow left with the distinct impression that an attempt has been made to persuade one of something.  Meaningless Coca-Cola ads are obviously - don't ask me what makes them so, or why it's obvious - 'for' rather than against Coca-Cola; this apparently pointless film is clearly 'for' rather than against the American armed forces.  Perhaps it's the air of leaden reverence.  Perhaps it's the rat-a-tat-a-tat drums.  Don't ask me what it is, and don't try to deny it, either.Here's what happens.  It's 1965.  The American forces land, are pointed towards a segment of the Vietnamese army and ordered to destroy it - i.e., kill as many of the people in it as possible.  The Vietnamese army seems (we're never told in detail) to have exactly the opposite goal: to avoid being killed, and to kill as many of the invaders as possible.  That's it. That's ALL the context we're given.  It's like watching the world's largest game of Skirmish, but without any rules.  To be sure, soldiers on both sides appear to be meeting with some success: a great many people die; the Vietnamese whose country is being invaded, cleanly and off-screen and with a minimum of fuss; the US soldiers, in all manner of creatively gory ways (the makeup and special effects artists seem to have had the time of their lives, finding new ways to show people dying).  By the end of the battle we've seen so much War Movie Stuff - trite platitudes, bone-headed 'inspirational' speeches, gore, bullets, bombs, mawkish death scenes, Goddammits - that we could easily fail to notice that we're never told what happened overall, let alone why.Before and after and in between all this senseless battle we see women on the home front; in one memorably bad scene, everyone sits around in a big circle looking uncomfortable, as though nobody can remember which actress is supposed to be playing which character, and acutely aware that it doesn't matter.  These women have little to do with the rest of the movie.  They're there as if because of 'equal time' legislation.  The same could be said of the cut-aways to the Vietnamese (who ought, by rights, to have been the centre-stage heroes), whom Wallace trots before the camera as though discharging a poorly understood duty that he'd like to get out of the way quickly.The ostensible hero, Colonel Moore, comes across as a grade-A prat; never in his entire screen career has Mel Gibson been so devoid of charm or discernible intelligence.  Perhaps his most buffoonish hour comes when he delivers the inspirational speech to the poor soldiers who are about to head off to a bloodbath on the other side of the world, where they'll kill and be killed in the service of... Well, he can't say what it's in the service of, so he says something unrelated which he imagines is stirring: 'Some of you will die.  I can't promise you that you'll make it back alive.  But I can promise this: I will leave no-one behind.  Dead or alive, we will all come back.'  This doesn't happen, of course, which is just as well.  (Imagine if Moore REALLY had to retrieve all the dead bodies, including those which fell into enemy-controlled ravines and those which nobody could locate.)  But the insult lies in offering this as something a condemned man would want to hear.  Surely some of the soldiers were standing there thinking: If I get killed in battle, BIG DEAL if my corpse has a seat reserved on the flight back.",4,1,4,15 August 2002
Snatch," One of the best of its kind in a crowded market
","We all know there are too many 'stylish' gangster films out there, but this is one of the good ones.  It's easy enough to spot the bad ones:(1)  A bad gangster film has insipid characters who are supposed to be interesting simply because they break the law - like the boring guy at a party who natters away endlessly about his magazine distribution company, who thinks the subject will become fascinating when he adds that he's worked out how to avoid paying tax.(2)  A bad gangster film is terrified, utterly terrified, that its lawbreaking characters won't look cool enough.  It doesn't dare let them do anything that might come across as dorky.  Look at 'The Limey' or the recent 'Shaft', and tell me that this fear of being uncool isn't stifling.  (By contrast, the gangsters in 'Pulp Fiction' are given the chance to make complete fools of themselves ... and maybe, in some people's eyes, they do; but at least they don't come across as insufferable posers.)The gangsters in 'Snatch' are varied, fascinating, and (in most cases) positively goofy.  Some of them are cartoons, but with a substratum of reality, and Ritchie, like Charles Dickens, wisely arranges things so that the cartoonish aspects of different characters are not allowed to get in each other's way.  These are INSPIRED cartoons - Brad Pitt's incomprehenisble, cunning-as-a-rat gypsy being the most inspired of all.",8,0,1,23 November 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Brilliant, just brilliant
","The film opens with a simple printed disclaimer: `The US army claims to have safeguards in place which render the following events impossible', or words to that effect.  Well, I'm willing to believe that.  Besides, that was 1964. Things have changed since, and the chances of an accidental nuclear exchange - between the United States and Russia, at any rate - have dropped considerably.  But `Strangelove' STILL gives me a small thrill of panic. Kubrick plays on our nerves masterfully.  At one moment it seems as if the forces of sanity are going to win, the next minute it seems as though they don't stand a chance: I won't reveal all the cleverly constructed reversals of fortune, but part of me is itching to.Peter Sellers's performances (all four of them) are gleeful fun to watch. It was a stroke of genius NOT making the president a buffoon.  In fact he's a decent and intelligent man, by no means a weak leader, and his relationship with Dmitri (the Russian general secretary) is almost touching - not that any of this helps him very much.I've noticed that a number of people who say they aren't fond of Kubrick in general make an exception for this film.  I can see why - even though I AM fond of Kubrick in general.",10,3,4,16 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Has anyone else noticed a certain trend ...
","`Star Wars' ended with Luke Skywalker's assault on the Death Star.  We followed Luke and Luke alone.  `The Empire Strikes Back' split the action at the end into two streams: we saw Leia and Han fighting for their freedom, and Luke Skywalker confronting Vader.  `Return of the Jedi' split things three ways: Endor, Death Star, rebel fleet.  And what do you know, `The Phantom Menace' divides the final action into FOUR streams.  If this trend continues things will start to get silly.  They already have.It's tempting to view `Return of the Jedi' as a sour omen of things to come. Lucas hired Richard `'whatever you say, George'' Marquand to direct his third Star Wars movie, which accounts for the general sluggishness.  He threw in pointlessly cuddly Ewoks.  Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher abandon the more adult romance of the previous film in order to play unconvincing second fiddles to all these furry things.  While John Williams's score retains its power, his source music is pretty weak.  Compared to the first two movies the dialogue is bland.  (It would get much blander come 1999.)  The story is an unimaginative re-hash of earlier work, except for Lucas's idea that bigger is better.  If the rebels have to do THREE things at once to travel INSIDE the EVEN BIGGER, DEADLIER Death Star with MORE SHIPS THAN EVER BEFORE in order to achieve an EVEN GREATER victory, it will surely make things more exciting - right?  Whatever you say, George.Special effects are particularly disappointing.  They're actually weaker than in the first two movies, with unbelievable - and I mean, literally unbelievable - muppets strewn all over the landscape.  (The blue vinyl elephant thing in Jabba's court gets my vote for most ridiculous alien.) Oddly enough the digital adjustments of 1997 only made matters worse.  The computer-generated pop singer Lucas created looks every bit as fake as that stupid animal with the big lips it replaced - it merely looks fake in a different way; and, furthermore, the presence of the computer creatures makes the puppets look more fake than they would otherwise look, and vice versa.  Perhaps it doesn't matter very much.  The special effects, creature effects, costumes AND art direction, had all deteriorated, with or without digital vandalism.Yet despite all this the release of `The Phantom Menace' makes `Return of the Jedi' look better than ever.  The chief difference between the two is that the latter, unlike the former, has a reason for being made in the first place.  The story begun in the first two movies needed a conclusion.  It DIDN'T need a prologue.  If the conclusion stumbles a bit, well, we must take the rough with the smooth: obviously the story had to end SOME way.  In any event, `Return of the Jedi' isn't a bad movie.  It coasts on the energy of the early movies, but it gets where it's going.  If you've just watched the earlier films this one still brings a lump to the throat.  Yes, it could have been much better.  Be thankful it wasn't worse.",8,3,6,9 September 1999
Taxi Driver," Good? Of course. Great? Erm...
","The comments I sent in recently were removed almost immediately after being accepted - for no explicable reason, unless the problem was that they were too long-winded, in which case the IMDb did have a point. I'll try to be concise this time.No doubt the talent that went into this film, and ended up on screen, is enormous. Well written, well designed, well directed, well edited, well scored, well acted; dialogue crisp, rhythms strong, illusion complete. What could possibly be missing?A lot, as it turns out. Imagine a series of diary entries written by the best prose stylist in the world, and imagine that this master stylist really believes in the thoughts he or she is expressing ... but that these thoughts are monotonous, trivial and of no concievable interest to anyone else. The world of Travis Bickle is well realised and we are completely drawn into it, but it's a world consisting of next to nothing. Travis is a narcissist. Nothing is real to him but himself and his own subjective impressions. That's all he sees and that's all we see. We get no sense of the world - the external world, that is - that this person inhabits (is New York really the jungle he sees it as being? who knows?); nor do we even get much sense of his psychology, his inner world. Just a series of subjective impressions. (The fact that the last ones are so ugly and violent, and unredeemed by any REASON for their being so ugly and violent, also detracts from the film.) It's done well, but one doesn't much care whether it's done at all.I'm not saying anything positive against 'Taxi Driver', you understand. A superbly crafted film is still a superbly crafted film. But those who say that it's one of the greatest film of all time (or some such rash claim) simply don't understand what greatness consists of.",5,5,13,20 December 2002
Taxi Driver," Perfect (perhaps), but minor
","Spoilers follow...I don't get the ending. And I'm not alone. Some find it so disjointed that they doubt it's even really part of the story; perhaps it's just Travis's fantasy, or a literal representation of the kind of 'redemption' Travis really wants (and does not get because he in fact dies shortly after the shoot-out), or some such.Roger Ebert rightly dismisses such worries, but in the wrong way. 'Whether Travis gains [what he wants] in reality or only in his mind is not the point; throughout the film, his mental state has shaped his reality, and at last, in some way, it has brought him a kind of peace.' Forget that Ebert doesn't realise that the ending is a miserable one however we take it: is he really, seriously saying that it doesn't matter whether this is a story about a man who really does by some fluke come to be accepted and loved and admired, or a story about a man who merely fantasises about being accepted and loved and admired when he isn't really? How could this crucial question not matter?I'm not sure, but I think the ending ISN'T real; whether it's a dream Travis actually experiences as he dies, or a screen depiction (made by Scorsese, for our benefit) of the kind of outcome Travis had been hoping for, is something I'm even less sure about. That I don't know is not surprising, given how few hints Scorsese is willing to drop. But why don't I even care? Why do I feel that Ebert has a point, and that none of this DOES matter?The trouble with this exceptionally well-made film is that it's every bit as narcissistic as Travis is. To the narcissist, nothing in the external world is quite real; to the film, and us watching the film, all of New York  feels as though it has no existence apart from Travis's highly coloured impressions of it. Is the place REALLY full of 'scum'? Are things really as bad as they appear to Travis? Who knows? The film, as I said, is exceptionally well made. The editing is arresting; the music and cinematography are flawless. But there's little point, and no soul. The world into which we're drawn consists of the subjective impressions of one very limited person; nothing else. Director (Scorsese), writer (Schrader) and actor (De Niro), all three at the height of their powers, concentrate their efforts on drawing us into the world of a man who concentrates HIS energy on pushing people away  us included.That 'Taxi Driver' is the best possible example of the very kind of film its creators intended it to be does NOT make it the great film so many people think it is. I'm not saying a word against it. I can find no positive fault. The film is not flawed; it merely lacks those virtues that true masterpieces have. It's not that it's more poorly made than (to take the film that *I* think is the finest made in the 1970s) 'Barry Lyndon'; it's just that 'Barry Lyndon' is a nobler kind of thing altogether.",5,2,6,15 December 2002
Barry Lyndon," I can't believe that there are people who find this dull.
","In fact it's one of Kubrick's most gripping pictures, with a narrative drive second only to that of 'Dr. Strangelove' (and it's unquestionably a more glorious creation than, say, anything he made in the 1950s).  English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into 'the trap of the picturesque', but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world.  Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don't have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.THIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen.  Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it's cut altogether - you won't catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in.  The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it's about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don't.  (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.)  And as always, Kubrick's musical sense is unerring.  My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles.  I was more or less right.  But then I noticed Schubert's name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I'd been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.It's a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this.  Look at the ones he's responsible for: 'Spartacus' (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) '2001' (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and 'Barry Lyndon'.  The last of the three is by no means a poor cousin.",10,272,321,11 March 2002
Empire of the Sun," Unfairly neglected and despised - not least by me
","I adored 'Empire of the Sun' when I first saw it.  I was seventeen; I had only recently discovered how some movies could grow, looking richer and better on repeated viewings, and I fully expected this one to, as well.So naturally I was disappointed when, instead of growing, it shrunk.  The streetwise American proved to be a fairly stale character - he began to look as if Spielberg was simultaneously reaching for the cynical American in 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', and Han Solo, and failing to grasp either.  And the central character, I noticed, undergoes a hell of a lot: war breaks out over his head, he loses his parents during an outbreak of mass panic, he nearly starves, he's imprisoned by the Japanese and rescued by the Americans - and what, then, is the moral of it all?  That people change.  The story is a good deal less interesting than I first took it to be.Well, I now realise, so what.  It's not the film's fault that I first saw it when I was seventeen.  The whole may be less than the sum of the parts, but the sum of the parts is a pretty big sum.  There's that wonderful extended sequence, which lasts from when Jim loses his parents until he (and I admit that this part is a turn for the worse) meets the American: for a while it looks as if Spielberg cannot set a foot wrong.  The way he returns to his old house and haunts it like a ghost.  The way one of his old Chinese servants stops packing, methodically walks over to him, slaps him across the face, and then resumes her packing.  It was the most economical way of getting through to the boy, it needed to be done, she'd wanted to do it for a while - and having done it ONCE, she could now move on to other things. The latter stretch of the movie, while disappointing, continued to serve up moments like these.  The cinematography is a delight throughout, and not just because these are pretty pictures.  Spielberg uses flawless images and cold, starry music to distance us from the scenes of war and privation and death and this is, I think his finest achievement: the whole film takes on the quality of vivid memories of things that cannot now be altered.Apparently David Lean tried and failed to turn J.G. Ballard's book into a film - and indeed it looks as if Spielberg, too, tried and failed to make a David Lean film.  But Lean soars so high there's plenty of room for others to fly beneath him without crashing.  It may be the influence of Lean that makes the best film Spielberg made between 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Schindler's List'.  It's a far better study in war than 'Saving Private Ryan'.  That film is as cheap and unsubtle as can be: it shocks us with blood and guts, then wears us down with inane spoken platitudes.  'Empire of the Sun' lets us conclude the nature of the horror, and draw lessons, for ourselves.",7,21,39,16 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not so bad as all that - except, perhaps, in the effect it will have
","Spoilers follow.Unlike 'The Phantom Menace', this one contains scenes that COULD have been great.  The scene on the ocean planet in which the long skinny aliens calmly tell Obi Wan that the army of clones he ordered (and has no knowledge of) is coming along nicely - that had something going for it, surely.  (I'd even go so far as to say that it's the stuff of great cinema.)  Or the scene in which Annakin exacts revenge on an entire tribe.  Remember, for instance, how chilling, how painfully constricting to our sense of hope, another such scene was in 'Lawrence of Arabia'?  And if THIS is the explanation of why Annakin became evil, it actually makes sense.  Most of the psychobabble we'd heard from Yoda over the course of the past three pictures was as cretinous as it sounded, but that using the powers that set one above one's fellow creatures for the specific purposes of revenge is particularly dangerous; now THAT we can believe.And, to be blunt, there's nothing wrong with the story. Nothing.Nor is George Lucas's direction nearly as bumbling and ill-judged as it was in the previous film.  Nor is this film nearly as bad as the previous one.And yet...While the story's not bad, the script is terrible: there would be far too much expository dialogue even if it were written with the slightest sense of wit or style, which it isn't.  If there are even more lines that fall leadenly on the ground than in 'The Phantom Menace', this is simply because there are more lines - but the reason doesn't matter; there ARE more lines that fall leadenly on the ground.  None of the actors know how to make them do anything else.  This time I AM inclined to blame the actors, to some degree; I know that few people could do much with the wretched material Natalie Portman was given, but many other actresses could at least have done something.  Look how well Christopher Lee acquitted himself; as, half of the time, did Ewan McGregor.  And when I said that the explanation given for Annakin's fall into evil was plausible, I spoke loosely.  There's no one explanation.  More than half a dozen are given.  He thirsts for revenge, he thirsts for power, he resents Obi Wan's leadership, he is in love and must hide the fact, he blames the Old Order for the fact that he couldn't save his mother, he trusts the wrong people, he admires the efficiency of dictatorships, he wants to cheat death ... it's as if George Lucas doesn't quite trust any one of these theories, and so he half-mumbles as many of them as possible, whenever a break in the action allows it - and the result, of course, is that none of them ends up sounding very convincing. (Another result: Annakin was actually more sympathetic as Darth Vader than as the bratty teenager he is here.)  And while George Lucas's direction is no longer terrible, it's still flat.  He hasn't regained his sense of when to cut, and he still compensates by editing his footage into shreds.  We don't get a good look at ANYTHING.  That's what really kills the scenes (and there are more than just two of them) that could have been great.Perhaps there were contributing causes of death as well.  Chief among them is the LOOK of the movie.  This is the first serious all-digital production in history.  Oh, there've been odd movies like 'Dancer in the Dark', but they've all had such grey, indistinct, watery, ugly images that I presume they weren't even TRYING to compete with film; 'Attack of the Clones' clearly is, with curious results.  In some ways it's much more real. Although some of the effects (in particular, the creatures, which are very badly animated indeed) are just as bad as before, there's no longer a clash in appearance between the CGI and the real footage; EVERYTHING has the same not-quite-there pastel look.  And when I left the cinema and started to look at real objects again it struck me that the experience of looking at the real world is much, much more like looking at digitally recorded images (when the level of resolution is high enough) than it is like looking at film.That's what I dislike.  It's the freshness of the film image, the fact that everything looks just as it does in real life and yet different, sometimes magically transformed, that's half the joy of looking at the screen. Digital pictures are just no fun to look at.  After two hours, I was longing to lay eyes on just one rich, saturated colour.  (What's worse: when I stepped outside, into a gorgeous autumn afternoon, I found that the digital images had temporarily robbed me of the ability to spot such colours even there.  Silver nitrate images, by contrast, SHARPEN our ability to see rich colours in the real world.)  Perhaps digital photography is best suited to black and white.Whether or not digital photography will remain inherently inferior, as it is now, remains to be seen.  What I fear most is that the deadening experience of looking at digital photography as it is now will prevent us from being able to improve on it - perhaps even prevent us from WANTING to improve on it.  If, as is frequently said, 'Star Wars' changed cinema forever, and for the worst, I can readily forgive it; 'Star Wars' is a good film.  A great film.  But if a mediocre non-film like 'Attack of the Clones' ends up destroying cinema altogether ... that, I cannot forgive.",6,2,5,17 May 2002
Romeo + Juliet," Please don't let any more films like this get made. Somebody draft a law.
","`Romeo and Juliet', but with gangs.  How audacious.  How cleverly handled. I refer, of course, to `West Side Story', which didn't pretend to adapt Shakespeare, but rather adapted the same basic story that Shakespeare himself adapted when he wrote the play.  For you can't have it both ways. You can cut yourself adrift from Shakespeare, force yourself to tell the story from scratch, and take a genuine risk; or you can create another performance of the play itself, in which case you will have to pay more than cursory attention to it.  For instance, if Luhrmann had re-read the play, he would have noticed that it is set not in modern day Florida but in Renaissance Italy.  Oops!This modern fashion for being counter-suggestible is now very old and more tiresome than it ever was.  Can you really imagine Shakespeare sitting down and saying, `I've written this rather neat tragedy about two people called Romeo and Juliet, but I can't decide on a setting.  Modern-day England? That's not a bad idea.  The moon?  That, too, is feasible ... Ah, what the hell, I'll use Italy, but that's just my preference: do what you want.' More offensive still is a Shakespeare with this frame of mind: `Having written Romeo and Juliet, I notice that I've set it in the past.  THAT was a foolish mistake.  Young people these days are much too stupid to understand anything set in the past - but they'll surely watch the play if I make a big deal about how hip and trendy I am, and if my characters are dressed in the latest fashions. So, with just a few trivial changes ...'This is an outrage.  Everyone does it these days, and has for decades, but that doesn't make it any less of an outrage.  It just makes the pretence of originality harder to take.P.S.: I really ought to disclose the fact that I haven't seen this film; and, of course, I never will.  Some might say this is a reason not to comment on it.  I agree in general.  But if a movie is a bad one, then surely there is SOME way of finding out about this, other than by watching it?",5,3,6,20 July 1999
Forrest Gump," Good if you're looking for something to set your teeth on edge
","The other nominees for Best Picture of 1994 were `Pulp Fiction', `Four Weddings and a Funeral', `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Quiz Show'.  ANY ONE of these would have been a deserving winner (my personal favourite was probably `Quiz Show').  Yet, of course, the award went to `Forrest Gump'.  I took this as a deep personal affront.  I took every undeserved success and wreath of flowers laid at the door of this miserable film as a personal affront.  It was a standing insult to my belief that `Forrest Gump' was just too stupid to succeed for very long.  Ah, well.  Life imitates art.Make no mistake: `Forrest Gump' is not just stupid but a hymn to stupidity, an extended celebration of stupidity as a virtue.  Gump is as innocent as they come and we're clearly meant to think that this is a good thing.  The trouble is that Gump has purchased his sainthood too cheaply.  He does not, for instance, display any real courage in the Vietnam War: he gives the appearance of courage only because he's too dumb to work out what's going on.  (If only a bomb had landed on his foot.  It would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.)The film is just one big, long appeal to the Pope to have Forrest Gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with.`Forrest Gump' is one hundred and forty-two minutes long.",2,30,70,30 September 1999
"Monsters, Inc."," The best computer animated film of them all, and the most adult
","Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation.  All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly ('Antz', 'Shrek', 'Final Fantasy'), and even the single unqualified success ('Toy Story 2') provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  'Toy Story 2' had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in 'Tarzan' (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match 'Fantasia' or 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'.  And I thought that 'Toy Story 2' was as good as the art was ever going to get.I was wrong.  This is far better.  And what's more, there's no sense whatever that the script (an unusually rich and uninhibited script) is bumping up against the limits of what the medium will allow.  It's now been proven that computer animation CAN be just as good as any other kind. Whether it will be allowed to be in future is another question, but for now, I'm hopeful.  What we have here is computer animation's first ENTIRELY unalloyed artistic delight, with every character gracefully and characteristically animated, every virtual set just right and pleasing to look at, and an eye-tickling mastery of colour, light and shade that I thought would forever elude CGI artists.It's not fair to judge anything good as 'Monsters, Inc.' as though it were a children's movie, but I can't resist comparing it with 'Shrek' - which emphatically IS a children's movie.  'Monsters, inc.' is admittedly ABOUT children, in a sort of a way.  The inhabitants of Monstropolis rely on children's screams for their energy, and the central story is kicked off when one of the monsters accidentally brings a small child (which he calls 'Boo') into the city.  But we never see things from her point of view.  We see things from the point of view of the monsters, who are all adults - and who, like most adults, see children as frightening, almost incomprehensible members of another species.  And they ARE.  To be sure, Wazowski comes to feel strong affection for Boo, but she never becomes more than a humanoid pet (which is not to demean the relationship).  This is a story about adults looking at childhood from the outside.'Shrek', of course, is a children's movie through and through.  Its attention span is short, it has an unthinking mean streak, and children will have a whale of a time watching the central characters (the bigger they are, the more fun it is) act childishly and make poo-poo jokes.  'Monsters, Inc.' has too much genuine wit, characters too rich, a world with too much depth, and a story at once too coherent and too complicated, to be PRIMARILY a film for children.  This is not to say children won't like it.  Maybe they will. (Who can say?)  Here's the bonus: if they DO like it, it will (unlike 'Shrek') actually have a beneficial effect.  It will make them less frightened of the dark.",10,63,80,2 January 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," It's not just charming - I insist it's charming
","With certain bad movies - 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' is a famous extreme example - you start to wonder if there's something wrong with people who don't realise that they're bad.  I'm not saying that if someone LIKES 'Plan 9' then his or her brain probably needs to be repaired; the suspicious, unhealthy thing is not LIKING the film, but being of the opinion that it's good.  (Many people have a soft spot for it precisely BECAUSE they realise how bad it is.  In this way it differs from something like 'Timecode', where either liking the film OR having a high opinion of it is something to be embarrassed about.)  And something similar applies to, say, 'Citizen Kane'. Disliking it makes sense; thinking it's a bad film does not.But there's another kind of film that tempts me to be even more presumptuous.  'Dumbo' is the best example I can think of at the moment.  I can see why one might (mistakenly) have a low opinion of 'Dumbo': some of the footage IS mere padding, the triumph at the end is too swift, the charge has been laid (falsely, but not ludicrously) that the crows are racist caricatures ... and so forth.  But surely even the people who think 'Dumbo' is a bad film must still manage to like it.  If they don't, THEN I'm suspicious.I feel this way, to a greater or lesser degree, about a number of light comedies, and this is one of them.  I can't honestly say that I revere or adore 'Bridget Jones's Diary' (N.B.: I'm male), but all the same, I can't help thinking that people who take an active dislike to it have something wrong with them.  This applies not just to the film as a whole but to Bridget Jones, the central character, in particular.  What has she done to merit dislike?  She's beautiful (as beautiful as Renée Zellweger has ever been on screen), honest and kind-hearted.  The diary she keeps certainly reveals her many flaws, but none is particularly pronounced, most are purely negative and anyway, she shares them all with the rest of us - so don't pretend you're not like this, too.This is an amiable, well-written and fresh romantic comedy with, for ONCE, an attractive female protagonist.  It's far from being the greatest film ever made and there may be grounds for attacking it which I haven't touched upon (I suppose there always are), and so all in all I'll understand your not thinking as much of it as I do, but, dammit, you'd better LIKE it.",Null,62,90,13 April 2002
The Godfather: Part II," No, no: it's a sequel like any other
","'The only sequel better than its predecessor.'  Come now, the ONLY sequel? How can you tell?  I can think of several such examples - and this isn't one of them.  The Godfather films (I presume we may ignore the third) are now a quarter of a century old, and if you haven't seen them, chances are that two snippets of information will leap into your mind when you think of them: they are about the Mafia, and the sequel is as good as the original.  This latter line has been repeated so many times, always with the same air of surprise, that it has entered popular mythology.  It is my sad duty to report that it's not true.'The Godfather' was a story about the corruption of a soul.  It was a good such story, since the person who suffered such corruption did so from the noblest of motives, or at any rate from motives it would have been hard to question.  But, of course, once the process of corruption is complete, the story's over.  'The Godfather Part II' is afflicted with the same blight that afflicts most of the other sequels we dislike.  It's just more of the same doodling at the end of the script, prompted by a desire to know what happens next after the point has been reached where we don't need to know - and, worse, it childishly gives in to the impulse to tell the same story AGAIN rather than think of a new one.  When the original story concerned itself with the corruption of a good man this is just impossible to pull off.Stylishly made, plenty of good bits, but heavily over-valued.",9,14,28,14 July 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Ten things I hate about Ten Things I Hate About You
","... Actually, I won't bother to count to make sure that I've got ten. Indeed, the film as a whole I rather like.  The crucial thing is this: Julia Stiles plays a likeable character, and so does Heath Ledger.  (I see they're letting Australian actors retain their accents.  Excellent!)  I was surprised to see that, MOST of the time, the script managed to treat the characters with respect.  A love story involving these two is worth watching.  If the backbone of the film is sound then the makers can afford to muff some of the inessentials.  To proceed:*  One of the characters is a fan of Shakespeare and Shakespeare is the subject of one of the classes.  Why doesn't someone NOTICE all the parallels?  `West Side Story', after all, kept the fact that Shakespeare had written a play on this very subject tactfully out of sight, and that's the way it should be.* The English teacher should be fired.  If not for his campaign of harassment against the only talented member of his class, then certainly for performing a rap version of Shakespeare's poetry to make it look `hip' and `relevant'.  Indeed, performing rap AT ALL would be misdemeanour warranting a small fine in any enlightened state.  So many other villains get their come-uppance in this film - why not him?* Speaking of which, why is it considered necessary for films set in high schools to have a score consisting entirely of songs?  Is it to remind us how many people out there are allergic to music without words?*  There's too much gratuitous pairing at the end.  Really, there's ONE couple whose fate is worth following - the rest can go hang.*  Why does the climax always have to be an end-of-year dance?Gee, that's only five.  Oh well.  I mean, this film is no masterpiece, but it's decent enough - there's no reason to be too harsh.",8,0,1,24 November 1999
Fargo," Triumph of parts over whole
","There are many incidental pleasures in 'Fargo', but where's the structure? I recall reading a definition in one of those concepts-for-which-we-have-no-words dictionaries: 'a book in which everything is clear except the author's purpose in writing it'.  Here is the cinematic equivalent.For those who want to excuse the film's messiness as the result of being based on a true story ... well, guys, I don't know how to say this: it isn't.  That 'the events you are about to see' opening statement is a simple lie.  They made it all up.  I don't know about you, but I'm not inclined to just shrug my shoulders and say, 'oh, well'; this is AT BEST the Coen brothers' shameful way of manipulating us into doing their work for them. They should use craft to make us accept their stories, not deceit.  No doubt they can pass it all off easily enough as a postmodern joke, but to tell the truth, I'd thought the Coen brothers were above postmodern jokes - and they are.  'Barton Fink' was one of the best films of the 1990s.  'Fargo', thanks to its shapelessness, fails to live up to the other three Coen works I've seen.  (In case you're interested, the remaining two are 'Miller's Crossing' and 'The Hudsucker Proxy'.)And yet, and yet ... Particular plot elements, individual scenes, certain characters and aspects of people's characters, are so fascinating, so artfully drawn ... it's frustrating.  Lundegaard is a wonderful character. He's the kind of man who stumbles from one weak act to the next and would probably hate himself if he stopped to think about his actions at all.  It was very clever of the Coens to begin his story in the middle.  We're never told exactly what fraud he's trying to cover up by kidnapping his wife; but we know, we just KNOW, that he committed THAT to cover up some lesser fraud, and the lesser fraud was in turn a way of saving face after he'd done some other thing, and that when we trace the chain of events back to its source we'll find ... in all likelihood, nothing.  Marge Gunderson is also a wonderful character.  She's proof that someone can be deeply, deeply good without being dull, or getting on our nerves.  Take the superb scene where she meets her old school friend in a restaurant ... but I'm reminded of what's wrong with 'Fargo', for what's THAT scene doing in THIS movie?  I can't make it out.  'Fargo' really baffles me.  So many good parts, a curiously unsatisfying whole; great throughout, good overall.",9,1,2,6 August 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A miserable montage of drab images, pretending to be an epic
","No doubt I'll be accused of setting my expectations too high.  In a sense, I did.  I honestly expected a good film, even though the other works of Peter Jackson I'd seen ('Meet the Feebles' and 'Heavenly Creatures') gave me little reason to expect one.  But in the end, so what?  The film is not bad because it failed to live up to Tolkein's book, or to my expectations, or to my hopes, or other to other people's expectations and hopes, or to anything external to itself.  It's bad because it's bad.  It would be bad even if Tolkein, and all his readers, had never existed.I don't mind in the least that the images of Middle Earth are different from my own private ones.  In itself, this would please me.  It's always so much more of a delight to be presented with unexpected beauty - with illustrations we feel we couldn't or wouldn't have come up with ourselves. The trouble with these images is that they're NOT particularly beautiful. And that's not all that's wrong with them...This is a story in which it's heartbreaking when so much as a single tree is felled, because the trees are so beautiful, and so rich in detail - except that they aren't.  Jackson's trees and landscapes are shot on grainy, unsaturated film (there's so little colour one wonders why he didn't  shoot in black and white - in fact, I found myself wishing he had), with a camera that can't keep still long enough for us to get a clear look at anything (when he bothers to venture out of doors at all; this is a horribly studio-bound production).  The story tells us that Middle Earth can't possibly be one tenth as drab as Jackson's images say it is.  For that matter, the countryside around Wellington isn't one tenth as drab as Jackson's images say it is.  As usual, the cheesy digital effects only serve to make everything look even more ordinary - but I'm sure the damage was done long before the CGI people even saw the footage.Given the fact that I'd read the book, and so had a sense of the wondrousness of Middle Earth that stood a chance of surviving Jackson's lousy camerawork, editing and effects, I might have been able to ignore all this - if the script hadn't been, in a word, dreadful.  To see what's wrong with it it's best (although not necessary) to look at how Tolkein paced the story in his book.Tolkein is careful to deny us information for as long as he can.  Judging from the first chapter, 'The Lord of the Rings' might well turn out to be a comedy of manners about hobbits in the vein of Jane Austen; only at the start of the second do we start to feel the static electricity that precedes a storm, and only AFTER we've become thoroughly engrossed in the characters and the stagnant world of the Shire does Tolkein even start to clear away the mystery he has created.  The quest begins slowly and it looks (to the characters, if not to us) as though it is almost over before we have a firm understanding of what was going on.  A film version of the story can be as cavalier as it likes with regard to detail so long as it preserves the slow pacing of the opening chapters, the mystery, and the GRADUALLY building threat.So what does Jackson do?  He tells us everything at once; he spends the first two-thirds of his film on rushed, unimaginative exposition; he fast-forwards through any scenes that might have been able to generate atmosphere or magic in order to concentrate on action scenes that (in the book) only have any effect at all because of what surrounds them.  An inordinate amount of time is spent in the mines of Moria.  This is absurd: the Moria sequence does not lie at the heart of the story, it's not (apart from one detail, which could have been far better handled) important in itself - and it all takes pace in near-perfect darkness.  That's the central flaw, but there are a hundred others.  Notice how we're shown the scene where Sam says goodbye to his pony, even though we never saw the part of the story where he acquired the pony - indeed, we never even knew that the pony existed until we saw the 'sad' farewell?  This may be the result of careless editing, but unfortunately, the entire script looks as though it might have come about as the result of careless editing.If Jackson's complete lack of visual skill adds insult to injury, Howard Shore's music adds insult to insult.  Tolkein's epic - in fact, ANY epic - deserves something better than this tuneless, pseudo-Celtic drivel.",5,6,18,30 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An insult to the book AND to the art of cinema
","Predictably, the film's apologists are saying things like, 'Well, books and films are separate media, changes have to be made, etc.'  OF COURSE you have to make changes when you film a book.  Everyone knows that.  My complaint is that Jackson made THESE changes rather than other ones.  Most of his choices have no justification other than laziness.  The result is a bad, flat,  lazy film ... and you don't have to read the book in order to realise how bad, flat and lazy it is (although it helps).I'm not the first to complain of the fact that we see Sauron almost immediately.  'But it's a MOVIE,' others have explained patiently in response.  'We HAVE to see the villain early on...'  It's people who say THIS that betray how little they understand film, not those who complain of infidelity to the book.  In 'The Usual Suspects' the master villain Kaiser Soze dominated almost every scene - as an unseen threat.  (Clarification: after a while there are hints that Soze MIGHT be one of the characters we've already seen, but this is inessential to the sense of menace.)  I hasten to add that I don't think much of 'The Usual Suspects', but at least the unseen villain aspect worked, if nothing else did.  I'm not convinced we need to see the villain at all (arguably we don't in 'The Exorcist'), but even if we must, we needn't see him so soon.  Think also of 'The Third Man', 'Jaws', the EFFECTIVE screen versions of 'Dracula' (not Coppola's), 'Ladyhawke'... The odd thing about Jackson's film is that we see the villain BEFORE we see the heroes; even 'Star Wars' did it the other way around.  And a lame and unimpressive villain it is too.  Darth Vader was twelve times more scary.The fact that Jackson's Sauron looks like a plastic samurai reminds me: there IS a successful film that adopts Jackson's strategy of showing us the villain(s) at the start, before cutting to the story of the good guys: Kurosawa's 'The Seven Samurai'.  I'm not saying the technique can't work, merely that it needn't be used (and anyway, it doesn't work here).  Any ONE of Kurosawa's samurai is more menacing than Jackson's Sauron, including the one played by Mifune - and the Samurai are the heroes.The point is that Jackson completely ignored the tension, the sense of stability gradually being eroded, in the book, in favour of an info-packed, voice over montage.  Does anyone seriously think this is a good CINEMATIC device?  It's simply the easy way out for a director who lacks either the courage or the skill or the good sense to do anything else.  Jackson is giving us information so that we'll know what's going on later; we get the feeling we should be taking notes.  In the book, Tolkein USED his information, holding it back until the right moment, so that when it was revealed, it had a dramatic and emotional effect.  Tolkein's is the better literary device; it's also the better cinematic device.  ('Star Wars', for instance, favours Tolkein's method.)If Jackson must have had a prologue, why not just a very short one - Bilbo finding the ring 61 years earlier?  Its significance would not be immediately obvious, but it would become clear soon enough, and clearer still as the narrative progressed.  Now THAT would have been good cinema. It would also have required careful work, though, which is why Jackson took the easy way out and just gave us all of the back story in one hit.And he makes the mistake of telling us everything at once again and again. There's no mystery to Frodo's flight from the Shire, since we know where the Black Riders are (and WHAT they are), where Gandalf is, etc., before Frodo does.  I can understand a director's reluctance to use an extended flashback, but they CAN work, IF handled with skill, which is no doubt why Jackson took the path of safe mediocrity.  ('The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' and 'Citizen Kane' both use extended flashbacks, so don't tell me the device can't work.)  The reason we are free to sit and listen for a long time in Tolkein's Council of Elrond is that it's a natural pedal point in the narrative; after a long and desperate flight, the heroes are at last safe, and it's time to relax and take stock.  This could have been just as true of the film as it is true of the book, IF Jackson had paced the action correctly ... or indeed, at all.In my earlier remarks I complained about how ugly and grim Jackson has made Middle Earth look; I won't belabour the point here.  But if THIS change from the book (in which get a true feeling of how lovely everything is) isn't a cinematic crime, I don't know what is.  As is the fact that the characters look as if they have been digitally pasted into the settings (even when they haven't been).  If you want to see more beautifully filmed landscapes to which the characters are more meaningfully related you needn't look far: try 'Lawrence of Arabia' (1962) (or anything by David Lean from the 1950s on), 'Himalaya' (1999), 'The Widow of Saint Pierre' (2000) - and these are just a few of the colour productions; 'A Canterbury Tale' (1944), 'The Seven Samurai' (1954), 'The World of Apu' (1959), 'Andrei Rublyov' (1969) and other films by the directors of these show how often it has been done in black and white.  Jackson uses colour so poorly I found myself wishing he HAD used black and white.  Indeed, his film is so bad that even a random change would probably be for the best.",5,2,4,14 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One final observation
","I sat through it again to see if it improved on acquaintance.  It doesn't. I noticed something new, though: Boromir's repeated use of the phrase 'my people'.  The peace that the rest of Middle Earth enjoys is paid for 'with the blood of my people'; all that he asks for, in the end, is 'the strength to defend my people'.  He's not the only character to use the phrase, either.Those who have read and understood 'The Lord of the Rings' will immediately spot the problem here.  Tolkein's characters would not, in these contexts, say 'my people'; they would instead say 'my country'.  (Even if they used an expression like 'the men of Gondor' they would MEAN something much closer to 'my country' than to 'my people'.)  The distinction is crucial.  'My people' is the language of an elected representative pushing the interests of her constituency or by a nomadic chieftain bartering for the interests of his tribe - but what the central characters in 'The Lord of the Rings' love and are fighting to save is something far greater than a collection of members of the group to which they happen to belong.  Hobbits love other hobbits, yes; but they also love, just as strongly, the Shire as a whole: the land, the trees, the streams, the customs, the place.  Boromir is not just a thug with a gang but the inhabitant and servant of a kingdom: he loves its capital city, its mountains, its language.  Characters in 'The Lord of the Rings' have roots in a particular place.  Remove the sense of rootedness, the love of and respect for nature, the terribly sad possibility of exile or loss of home, and the generally accepted feeling that some causes are larger than the people whose interests they happen to serve - in short, remove everything that's implied by 'my country' that isn't implied by 'my people' - and there's really not much left.That's why the phrase 'my people' sounded so jarring every time I heard it - and I think it jarred on me even the first time I saw the film, although I didn't stop to think why.  The fact that neither the writers nor the director noticed the jarring effect is evidence that they didn't know what they were doing, and is perhaps the most direct symptom of a failure of vision that explains almost every other flaw: the fact that Elrond has turned into a narrow-minded politician, the jumbled use of unrelated locations, the excessive (and unconvincing, and unattractive) CGI, the scenes which should occur during the day taking place at night, the insufficient time devoted to the opening chapters.Those who haven't read the book won't notice what particular elements are missing.  But it's hard not to notice the absence of a soul.",5,1,2,24 May 2002
Grease," Inexplicable
","Why THIS? Why is THIS, of all musicals, so popular?And why was THIS film re-released all over the world - in mainstream cinemas that were unwilling to touch even 'Apocaypse Now Redux', no less - rather than some other musical of the 1970s? (I presume 'Grease' appeals primarily to people for whom cinematic history begins in the 1970s, otherwise the question of why not some other musical becomes even more perplexing.)  Why not 'Scrooge'? 'Fiddler on the Roof'? 'Jesus Christ Superstar'? 'The Slipper and the Rose'? I'll admit I haven't seen those last two, but that's partly the point - I'd LIKE to see them, whereas 'Grease' is the kind of thing I watch either because of a compulsive behaviour disorder or out of duty, to see if this time around I'll get to find out what makes it so popular.No luck so far. I'll admit it's mediocre, no worse, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth. In the course of the whole we-made-it-up-as-we-went-along narrative none of the characters, with the possible exception of two of the Pink Ladies, demonstrates that he or she has a soul, or any of the standard mechanics that make up a human being: beliefs, desires, passions, and so forth. The shallowness goes beyond the fact that the characters are shallow. The characters aren't even really THERE; the film comes across as a circus, a revue, something to enable the songs to be strung together. Each song, considered by itself, sounds as though it's expressing something (which is why the early songs, particularly 'Summer Love', work best), but this usually turns out to have been an illusion. The unpleasant undercurrent of cruelty is probably accidental. The aggressive barrage of sexual references (it might have come across as playful, but it doesn't) probably isn't, although I'm amused at all the people who pride themselves on being able to play Freud with 'Greased Lightning', almost the only five-minute sequence that ISN'T sexual.Someone here said, of 'Grease', that it dates from the era when people knew how to make musicals, when the song-and-dance routines exhibited real performing talent and energy. And so it does; but it comes from the very end of that era. It's the dying gasp. Vey often we can see THAT the performers are energetic, but a sustained display never quite makes it onto the screen. Part of the problem is sonic. The songs, never the best, have been shockingly recorded; listen to 'Sandra Dee' with your eyes shut, and you can't fail to notice that the words sound thin and the music even thinner, and the voices in 'Greased Lightning' (which has been ineptly staged) vanish into no particular musical texture even if you keep your eyes open and TRY not to notice.",6,1,6,7 February 2003
Cast Away," The good side of mediocre
","In contrast to most people I found the quality even and unremarkable throughout.  Would someone explain to me, for instance, what was so great about the plane crash?  Yes, the moment when the cabin de-pressurises comes as a real jolt, but shock tactics are easy.  It's like the moment in horror movies when a skeleton hand suddenly shoots up out of a grave.  It's startling, not frightening.  All in all the crash/storm sequence is humdrum and badly shot.  What was the point of those intermittent blackouts? They're irritating; besides, Zemeckis has it backwards: a storm isn't light punctuated by darkness, it's darkness punctuated by light.  If anything the plane crash was a low point.That's the movie as a whole: decent but lacking, marred by poor craft throughout.  Among the questionable decisions: computer generated whales (straight out of 'Fantasia 2000'), FedEx (they could so easily have used a made up brand name), and too much editing on the island.  The last really destroyed our sense of the passage of time, and with it any idea we may have had of how well the Tom Hanks character was faring.  How long did he go before finding enough water to live on?  I don't know, but I suspect it's longer than Zemeckis tried to lead us to believe, with his frequent cuts. All the small sequences before the `four years later' caption (itself a cop-out), good though they may have been individually, collectively come across as mere montage rather than a sustained assault on the problem of survival.-On the other hand, what was so bad about the third act?  'Cast Away' is at heart a gently optimistic story of survival: its message is that mere survival - MERE survival - isn't really so bad as all that when you get to know it.  Some people wanted Tom Hanks to feel utterly bleak, to fall to pieces, when confronted with civilisation again.  Why would he?  Living in a city again after four years would be like re-adopting a half-forgotten habit - riding a bicycle for the first time in a decade.  The truth is, there's nothing much to say about what happens when he rejoins the larger world.  I found the concluding section the most honest part of the film, if a little aimless.All in all, not bad.  I remember a reviewer writing that the Oscar Zemeckis won for 'Forrest Gump' would destroy him as an artist.  I remember thinking at the time: 'Well, how could it not?  He's just been rewarded for creating something terrible.'  And, it must be noted, 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' was Zemeckis's only masterpiece.  But it was also an unrepeatable accident.  The kind of zaniness it exemplifies so easily turns sour in his hands (as in 'Death Becomes Her' or the entire Back to the Future trilogy); on the other hand, if he keeps plugging away in an attempt to create something grand, he may one day succeed.",7,0,1,26 June 2001
Lilo & Stitch," As good as animation ever gets
","If we're STILL hearing idiotic comments about the Disney 'formula' after this, I think I'll scream. Just so I'll know, which Disney cartoon, exactly, is representative of the formula which the rest allegedly follow? Certainly not the last, say, five, which show an astonishing amount of daring and have nothing whatever in common with one another: 'Tarzan', 'Fantasia 2000', 'The Emperor's New Groove', 'Atlantis', 'Lilo and Stitch'. True, two of those five ('Fantasia 2000' and 'Atlantis') are total misfires, but two others are of transcendent quality: 'The Emperor's New Groove' and 'Lilo and Stitch'. And 'Lilo and Stitch' turned out, to my surprise, to be even better than 'The Emperor's New Groove' - and what's more, even funnier. (It's even more surprising because the prologue before the main title, a meeting of the Alien High Council, suggests something generic and ordinary - but thereafter, every single moment is solid gold.) At least half of the humour, as it should, comes from the animation: the way Stitch is drawn, the way he moves, the strength of the characters' attitudes and, ultimately, the depth of their emotions.The animation is (after the disappointing 'Atlantis') of the highest Disney standard; the art direction is fresh and lovely (the backgrounds are in watercolour, for the first time in decades); and the minimal computer animation is used tastefully and correctly - there is NOT ONE garish mismatch between, say, a CGI spaceship and a pencil-animated human. The characters feel unique and even the child, Lilo - ESPECIALLY the child, Lilo - is endearing. The strong sentiment towards the end is not manipulative or false, but grows naturally out of the comic premise.  There can be no doubt: this is a GREAT movie.One thing I will hear occasionally that will also make me want to scream is the critical kiss-of-death: 'Lilo and Stitch' is 'good for children'. This is perhaps the most misleading thing a reviewer can say. It's GOOD, period. I don't know what particular demographics - children, adults, Hawaiians - will most admire the film, and I don't care.",10,4,5,20 September 2002
Armageddon," Apocalypse Lite
","What does it mean to say that an asteroid is 'the size of Texas'?  Is the asteroid Texas-shaped?  Is its diameter that of Texas north-south, or east-west?  Or is it that the asteroid has the same volume as a sphere with a diameter the same as that of a circle with the same surface area as Texas? That seems to me to be the most charitable reading.This is the kind of inane discussion the characters in 'Armageddon' might as well be having, for all the concern they show over the imminent end of all life.  They discuss the matter as if they're talking about the annual tax return deadline.  To be honest, I think taxation worries them more than death - which is exactly the mean-spirited attitude you'd expect from a loud, over-edited, the-stupid-shall-inherit-the-Earth Bruckheimer parable. If this were a book, it would be a paperback, it would be sold in newsagents, its title would be in silver letters, and each paragraph would be one sentence long.  Possibly two.One worthwhile thing, though: we get to see what a good actor Bruce Willis is.  Objectively speaking his character is insufferable.  He gets his jollies by whacking golf balls onto the heads of Greenpeace protesters.  His over-the-top protective attitude towards his daughter, while I'm sure it's meant to be cute, is only just this side of perverted.  In short, he's a jerk.  If we nonetheless like him - or at worst, fail to dislike him - this is entirely due to Bruce Willis.  He can make any character charming.  Part of the secret is knowing how much charm too use; too much charm is as bad as too little, and Willis knows never to turn the `charm' knob higher than necessary.  In `Armaggedon', it's set at maximum.",5,1,3,18 January 2001
North by Northwest," I rank it as Hitchcock's 19th best, myself
","Let's get one thing straight: this film is tremendous fun.  Don't lose sight of this fact because of anything I say.  It's fun ALL THE WAY THROUGH, even when it creaks.  Moreover I can see some of the things that lead people to the ridiculous conclusion that it's a masterpiece.  Several scenes are classics in miniature - I can't really say which ones, but I suppose you already know about the crop duster sequence - then there's the priceless line Cary Grant delivers as he runs to the aeroplane on the slopes of Mt. Rushmore, so carefully led up to - and Bernard Herrmann's score is brilliant.And yet ...That damned Eve Kendall: SHE'S the McGuffin, not the 'government secrets' the baddies are trying to smuggle out of the country.  (Clearly the film wants us to think she's so much more important than they are; but if it refuses to tell us what the villains want and why, how are we in any position to make a comparison?  Hitchcock's McGuffin theory led him astray here, I fear.)  The heroine of 'North by Northwest' can't hold a candle to her vibrant counterpart in the original cross-country Hitchcock, 'The 39 Steps' (1935).  Watch the original to see what's missing from the remake. The later film has a tendency, just a tendency, to fall asleep on its feet: it needed more poetry in its quest, more humanity in its hero, more vigour in its man hunt, less tedium in its exposition.  If I didn't know better - if I hadn't seen 'Vertigo', released the previous year, or 'Psycho', from the subsequent one - I'd say Hitch had ossified.",7,1,4,6 August 2000
Doctor Zhivago," Flawless beauty - the fact that it's not Lean's best is beside the point
","David Lean had just directed two of the greatest films ever made ('The Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'), the more recent of which was easily the greater.  As you'd expect 'Doctor Zhivago' isn't as good.  But this isn't to say that it's flawed in any way; there is, in fact, NOTHING wrong with it.Of course, the previous two films had exceptionally strong stories; this one, while rich in incident, has almost no story - which would not be interpreted as a defect.  The point of the film is to sketch a historical epoch by showing us the thin life-lines of a handful of people who lived through it.  It's like looking at a stretch of a vast river and seeing the illuminated pathways of half a dozen or so minute particles.  If there seems to be an undue amount of coincidence in the way these pathways repeatedly intersect ... well, we had the whole river to choose from.It was fashionable to criticise Maurice Jarre's score at the time, but, in addition to being undeniably attractive and catchy, it comes across as a model of intelligent and tasteful scoring today.  Bolt's script is based on less promising material than 'Lawrence of Arabia' so is less inspired, but still flawlessly crafted.  Particularly good are the gaps in the narrative. Some things we simply don't see: anything of Yevgraf's life before he enters the story, anything that happens to Pasha when he isn't in the vicinity of Zhivago ... but we have the material available to infer, and as it happens, it's the fact that we infer rather than see that makes the story feel so convincingly large.Most of all, this is a beautiful film, with some of the most breathtaking location footage (it doesn't matter that it's Spain and Finland standing in for Russia) ever shot.  As always, the real test is whether the characters look like they're really there (Moscow, the distant Russian countryside), their feet really touching the ground and leaving footprints.  If 'Doctor Zhivago' had done nothing but convey this impression so well it would still be a masterpiece.",10,58,76,12 April 2002
The Shining," Good, sound horrific fantasy
","I watched a documentary about Stephen King recently.  One of the critics interviewed (a critic favourable to King - there was no other kind present) gave us an old line: King uses brand names, makes references to popular television, and has his characters eat at McDonalds, in order to bring horror out of the musty old castle and into the streets of the very suburbs in which his readers live.The interviewer didn't actually say, in so many words, that this was a good thing.  He didn't have to.  It's almost impossible to say something like this without it sounding like praise.  But I consider it damning criticism. I LIKED the musty old castle.  Why I should I rejoice when it gets demolished to make way for some fast food outlet?  McDonalds has managed to invade our cities, our countryside, our airwaves and our sporting events; I don't see why it should be allowed to invade our fiction as well.Sure, our imaginative has been enriched by artists who have managed to find beauty where none had been previously thought to reside.  But it's not possible to find beauty just ANYWHERE.  McDonalds (for instance) is so squalidly banal, so dully horrible, that it would defeat ANYONE'S attempt to find something attractive or even picturesque about it.  Some things can't be romanticised.  Not, I suspect, that King would romanticise McDonalds even if he could: he seems to have been infected with the modern idea that one must never romanticise one's subject, that romanticism is a kind of a sin, or at best a 19th-century toy which we have now outgrown.  King, remember, is a writer of fantasy.  How can he write good fantasy WITHOUT romanticising one's subject?  He can't.  No one can.At this point I should mention I haven't read `The Shining', but I have seen the 1997 miniseries which King wrote and produced, and the pattern holds: the hotel is, you know, just this place.  But KUBRICK is a romantic.  (Look at anything he's made in colour and try, if you can, to dispute this.)  HIS hotel doesn't have Big Mac wrappers in the driveway and used chewing gum under the seats to invest it with a boring plausibility; instead it's the kind of grand place, the very archetype of a haunted hotel, which anyone with a soul will WANT to visit.  Fictionally speaking.Each of the four principle actors is perfect, even the kid (I'll concede that Nicholson looks a bit too familiar, but that's a problem generated by other films, not this one) - they certainly beat the insipid, T-shirt-wearing nonentities in the miniseries.  Many of the complaints you'll hear about the acting are foolish ones.  Nicholson does not overact. Maybe real madness should be understated; but this is fantastic, supernatural madness - what did you EXPECT it to be like?  And Shelly Duvall is there to gain our sympathy, not impersonate Sigourney Weaver.",10,0,2,24 May 2000
American Beauty," Some notes on how it ends
","I discussed this with a friend and she, too, didn't like the ending; her quarrels was quite different from mine, and I think we were both right.  I would advise you not to read on if you haven't seen the film.  Yes, I know it's announced right at the start that Lester will shortly be dead; that isn't what I'm about to reveal.MY problems were as follows.  The film tells us about Lester's imminent demise TWICE at the start.  It struck me at the time as unnecessary; I later found it was done so as to manipulate us into a silly game of guessing and second-guessing towards the end.  Which one of the suspects before us will commit the fatal act?  Will it be (a) the daughter, acting in concert with her lover?  Or (b), the daughter's lover, acting alone?  Or (c), the frustrated wife, smarting with shame?  Or (d), the fascist-minded neighbour? In fact, we start by thinking we know that the answer is (a), but this is a trick of presentation that amounts to simple cheating.  By presenting a not particularly crucial scene TWICE Mendes makes it seem important.  But in any case, what's the point of this cat-and-mouse game with the viewer?  Suddenly the picture becomes conventional and just a little stale.Well, as everyone still reading knows, the answer is (d), which brings me to my second problem.  The neighbour is driven to murder only because he's led to believe, falsely, that Lester is gay.  How does he come to believe this? Sheer, flimsy chance.  Had a window frame not conveniently occluded his view, had he not happened to watch a few 'incriminating' minutes of videotape out of the hundreds of HOURS stored in his son's room, the tragedy would never have occurred.  It's almost an eighteenth-century farce.  Lester is not in any sense 'doomed to die' at the start of the film; nor does he play with fire; his eventual death is as meaningless as, 'and then he was hit by a falling piano', except that - and this is what makes it worse than the falling piano scenario - we are made to examine the fatal chain of events at ridiculous length.Here are my friend's concerns.  She thought a sudden death at the end was simply gratuitous; a tacked-on piece of pessimism to a story the logical conclusion of which would be happy.  The death is (my friend pointed out) a good deal unhappier than I'd noticed.  There's no indication that the neighbour will even be suspected of the murder; there's every indication that Jane and Ricky WILL be suspected.  The videotape we saw twice will also be seen by the police.  The two lovers cannot now flee to New York, both of them are likely to be imprisoned, and, to add insult to injury, Lester (like the film as a whole) ignores their fate entirely in his blissful ruminations on life that are meant to sum up the story.  It's one thing to concentrate primarily on Lester to the exclusion of everyone else.  It's quite another to tell us Jane's story as well, showing us incidents that don't concern him and which he will never even find out about - and then, in the end, leave his daughter in the lurch by simply forgetting about her.  If Mendes wants to bring Lester's daughter into the story at all he can jolly well treat her with respect.My long complaint may give a false impression.  As it happens a sour conclusion is not nearly enough to sour the film as a whole: it's just so GOOD throughout.  Simple, beautiful, moving scenes - the moment when Carolyn cries after degrading herself in front of potential customers, or the dinner-time argument after Lester quits work - are presented with an almost arrogant freshness; I was all the more disappointed with the conclusion because I had been lulled into believing that the film-makers were so skilled they couldn't possibly let me down.  (And - think what you will of me for saying this - the sight of Thora Birch undressing and standing there topless would be worth sitting through a bad movie to see, let alone this one.)  Taken all in all I'm very glad 'American Beauty' was made.",6,1,2,31 July 2000
Apocalypse Now," Nearly a sham, nearly a great movie
","'Apocalypse Now' shows that something can be a great film and pretentious drivel at the same time. That is to say, it demonstrates the possibility of being both, without itself quite being either. There are some magnificently realised scenes, such as could be PART of a masterpiece, but in the end - when Coppola has run out of river, so to speak - the movie goes nowhere, because it has nowhere to go. And let's face it: the man, for all his virtues as a director, in the 1970s at least, can't generate more than the minimal amount of tension needed to keep his film going, to save his life.Spoilers follow...There are two mysteries regarding Colonel Kurtz: one, why he went insane, and two, why - given that the other commanders in Vietnam are guilty of bloody atrocities, too, and that the whole POINT of the war is to destroy - the higher-ups want to have him killed. The answer to the first question is clear enough. If we hadn't got it already, it's answered in the last really strong scene, when we see the patrol boat stop a civilian river boat and machine-guns the occupants (who, it turns out, are NOT smuggling weapons downriver at all). The wounds sustained by the woman on the boat are not fatal and when the shooting's over the pilot of the patrol boat starts talking about handing her over to the nearest group of 'friendly' civilians for medical aid. Captain Willard is frustrated with the hypocrisy and simply shoots the woman. This is WHY Kurtz went insane (and it's clear enough why Willard would react to the same situation in much the same way; he works, remember, for the CIA). But why do his superiors care? Why do his superiors want him out of the way, when he's after all doing what they're doing and what they seem to want him to do? Maybe there's a good answer - maybe, for instance, they want Kurtz to die DURING the war, so that he won't be an embarrassment afterwards. But this is just a guess based on no particular evidence presented to us during the movie; and I don't like this answer much, anyway. (What's one embarrassment among many?) The point is, when a film sets something up as an intriguing mystery, it should at least have an answer in mind.The main trouble with Kurtz as a character and plot device is that he's simply a swamp at the end of the river, something for the narrative to get mired in and never emerge. Even so, it was a pity about Marlon Brando. Coppola should certainly have cast a more convincing actor, one who wouldn't, in Danny Peary's words, 'contemplate the universe before delivering each line', but it was an added misfortune that Brando simply refused to co-operate, and that Coppola had to edit the footage to remove as much of Brando's presence as he decently could.Two of Coppola's technological choices deserve comment. He was absolutely right to shoot in Technicolor; indeed, every single aspect of the way the film was shot, was absolutely right. The vivid colours and endlessly rich detail, even the luscious beauty, only make the horror more horrifying. But he was absolutely wrong to use synthesisers to play the musical score. The music undoes a small part of the cinematography's good work (in addition to dating the movie badly). They should have used real instruments - ANY real instruments. The only use of music that really works is when a recording of Wagner cuts through the rest of the soundtrack, just before American helicopters raid and strafe a Vietnamese village.",6,6,14,21 September 2002
Being John Malkovich," Good stuff - only just misses out on being first-rate
","The story could easily have been published in `The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction', or (this is less of a compliment but certainly not a criticism) `Asimov's'.  Anyone who liked the movie should certainly look through these publications, and others like them.  Both magazines are still very much alive and it's a pity they're not read more.  But for maximum pleasure, do try to find some copies of `Fantasy and Science Fiction' from its glory days of the 1950s and 1960s.  (Please don't do this if you live in Australia, because I'm trying to track down old copies myself.)Indeed, the story would probably have reached its ideal type in literary form, so it's a pity Kaufman DIDN'T submit it to the magazines - they wouldn't have paid as much, but he could always have made a screenplay out of the idea later.  Some aspects (like the thirteenth-and-a-halfth floor, and the puppetry) are well suited to cinema, but the central conceit would be better served by the written word.  How does one SHOW, visually, that Craig is receiving all the sensory information that John Malkovich is receiving?  I don't thing Kaufman and Jonze quite solve this problem.There are people out there who think that good plots, intelligent dialogue, consistency and cleverness are all purely literary virtues, of no particular value in the cinema.  This is a silly view.  Any work of art that has a plot can be judged according to the quality of its plot; any work of art capable of manifesting intelligence can be judged according to how intelligent it is.  Speaking of which, I do have one quibble ...As everyone knows, there's this tunnel; and when one gets to the end of the tunnel, one experiences whatever John Malkovich is experiencing.  What happens when John Malkovich himself enters the tunnel?  The film offers an answer, and it's pretty lame.  Not that I know myself what would happen.  I guess it's under-determined.  But here's a thought: suppose there's a time-delay, so that a person in the tunnel experiences whatever Malkovich experienced, say, 0.01 seconds earlier.  THEN John Malkovich entering the tunnel would experience 0.01 seconds of John Malkovich entering the tunnel, again and again, and maybe each copy of the experience would be more degraded than the last.I can't think of anything wrong with the details of the story.  It's because of the story that `Being John Malkovich' is so good, if not the masterpiece everyone seems to think it is.  The cinematic prose could do with a bit of a re-write.",6,1,2,5 January 2000
Face_Off," Butchered Handel and facial tissue
","Early on the villain utters the line, 'You even make that HACK composer Handel sound good.'Well OF COURSE Handel will seem like a hack, if you judge him by this edited-to-within-an-inch-of-its-life version of the Hallelujah chorus plucked from some thirty-second Mitsubishi ad.  What is this - the Good Bits Messiah for Cretins?  But then, all of 'Face/Off' is similarly mangled and over-edited.The basic conceit is silly, not that it's the silliness I object to - Sean Archer (played by John Travolta and Nicholas Cage) swaps faces with Castor Troy (played by Nicholas Cage and John Travolta).  I mean, literally. Archer and Troy don't just disguise themselves as one another; they literally SWAP FACES.  Imagine a film predating heart transplants, in which the hero and villain (again, literally) swap hearts.  Is that gross, or what?  Well, this is grosser.  I wouldn't have minded in the least if the face-swapping had been non-literal, and accomplished by supernatural means, but it isn't: we actually SEE the gruesome medical procedure, and thereafter it's hard to look at either actor's face without shuddering.Ugh.I find it hard to believe that Woo believed in what he was doing in this film - while the almost-as-silly 'Mission: Impossible 2' had visual poetry, 'Face/Off' just has visual gimmickry, and, I swear, twice as many edits. (Should I see Woo's earlier, Hong Kong work?  No doubt I should.  I'm ashamed to admit I haven't.)  -But bear in mind that, although I'm usually a fairly charitable viewer, I sat through most of 'Face/Off' in a sour mood. That Handel massacre at the start is enough to put anyone in a sour mood.",3,2,5,27 January 2001
Spider-Man," A mostly successful throwback
","At first it looks as though the title sequence lets us know what we're in for: the kind of hyperkinetic visual display you'd expect from a fourteen-year-old boy who'd just been handed a cheap (but nonetheless overpriced) computer animation program and who was determined to use every misbegotten one of its features at once. I thought I was watching the end result of an arms race in which studios vied to combine maximum glossiness with minimum creativity.Not at all, as it turns out. 'Spider-Man' is the kind of fantasy we haven't seen since the 1980s: sweet, sincere, straightforward, and thrilling  or at least, if and when it fails to be thrilling, it at least makes an honest attempt.The movie works even though Raimi gets more wrong than he gets right. The main problem is that there's little real zing. But in addition: the dialogue is often awful, too many characters (the aunt in particular) are under-written, under-described clichés, and the montage Raimi throws at us as Peter Parker comes up with his spider suit design is just too goofy for words. What's more, when we get within fifteen minutes of the end it becomes clear that everyone stopped paying attention to the movie they were making and started thinking about the money to be made from a sequel. I won't say what happens Okay, I WILL say what happens, so stop reading if you must. Peter gives up Mary Jane  fails to tell her identity even though the entire narrative is structured around, is crying out for the moment in which she finds out - for no better reason than to facilitate a sequel. (Thus the most likable character in the film, on whom so much time had been spent, is given nothing to do, no real role to play in the story.) The misunderstanding over the identity of Norman Osborn's killer has been crudely pasted into the film for much the same reason. Is there any reason why Harry had to happen to see Spider-Man standing over his father's body, and then jump to an obviously wrong conclusion? None whatever, but it DOES provide him with a sudden overpowering 'motivation' which will, alas, result in all manner of tedious plot complications in the sequel, perhaps even  who knows?  the sequel's sequel.The final image, by the way, is every bit as bad as the opening ones. It just goes to show that nobody has ever made a movie better by including a shot of the American flag, in any context whatever.But don't forget what I said earlier, about this being a sweet, sincere, simple  and for the most part competent  fantasy. Kirsten Dunst is charming.",Null,0,1,12 November 2002
The Fast and the Furious," I blame the sound
","Too loud.  Any time there's a car (or motorbike) moving anywhere in the frame, we have to listen to a teeth-splintering metallic roar which doesn't get any louder or quieter - it just is.  Like the people who provided the hideous music and rap chanting that makes up the soundtrack most of the rest of the time, the sound effects guys don't seem to understand that the value of dynamic contrast: if the roar of acceleration is preceded by silence, we FEEL the acceleration.  If it's always that loud we just feel a mild throbbing pain around the ears.Most of the speeding footage (there are one or two visual conceits that come off, and that final, utterly unmotivated chase towards the end is, I'll admit, exhilarating) is also all wrong.  It's the modern vice: cut, cut, cut.  If only the director had been willing to see just one of his shots through to the end.  The computer-generated footage of car engines doesn't help, either.-Oh, and the story is one of the most ludicrous I've ever encountered (sample: the roadsters who rob trucks, when they operate at night, are covered from head to toe so that they won't be recognised; when breaking the law in broad daylight, they scarcely wear anything, presumably because they want to be recognised by the audience) ... and I wanted to like the story, I really did.  I even thought the basic situation was promising - as was the look and feel of the world in which the hero found himself.  (Cinematography is excellent.)  But the plotting is irredeemably silly, and what's worse, it gets in the way of the racing and the hotrod ambience and the views of Michelle Rodriguez and whatever else we were supposed to be looking at - just as they get in the way of the plotting.",Null,1,2,1 March 2002
The Exorcist," Who cares about milestones in the history of horror? This is a damned good film.
","I saw the new version a week or two ago.  To be honest, I had to look up later which bits were added for the (ahem) director's cut and which had been there all along; it seems to me that the additions have more or less no effect, apart from making the film longer - and since 'The Exorcist' is such a strong, absorbing film, the longer the better.Whether it's THE classic horror movie - whether it's a horror movie at all - is something I couldn't care less about.  It bears no resemblance to slasher flicks.  I'm not even sure what about it (if anything) makes it frightening. I recall being the teensiest bit frightened when I saw it on video in the mid-afternoon many years ago; just recently, in the cinema, I was not frightened in the least.  But who cares.  'The Exorcist' succeeds as work of fiction, rather than a mere heartbeat stimulator, because of its humanity. The priests are all human.  So much so that I felt positive affection for the Catholic Church, without ever being manipulated into so feeling - odd, but there you are.  Regan is portrayed in the early scenes as a genuinely nice child, someone you instinctively warm towards, and so we continue to care about her however many unspeakable acts her possessed body may later perform.  The point is this : the film cares about its characters - ALL its characters - and despite the grim goings-on, it isn't particularly cruel to them when it comes time to decide their fates.Satan, of course, is not a human character, but even he has been intelligently portrayed.  Those who have read the depiction of satanic possession in C.S. Lewis's 'Perelandra' will recognise this as the very same Prince of Darkness - not so much a being of infinite evil as one of infinite, childish spite.  (Why does Satan bother to take control of human bodies?  What's in it for him?  'Spite' is really the only answer that makes sense, so spite it is.)  The difference between 'Perelandra' and 'The Exorcist' (well, one of them) is that the latter doesn't console either the audience or its characters by repeating several dozen times in big bold underlined letters that there IS a loving god who is omnipotent and who will win out over Satan in the end, etc.  But surely this is a strength.One tiny weakness is the fact that the actual exorcism - if you got your stopwatch out, I suspect you would be surprised how little of the film's time it takes up - isn't as interesting as everything leading up to it. How, exactly, can these two priests force a demon out of this child's body? Be honest now: what does all this splashing of holy water actually achieve? How can we see the first few minutes of the ritual as going anywhere when we are told that the last exorcism Father Merrin performed lasted over a month? The film seems to stall.  And the sudden conclusion is - well, sudden. Still, it's not the cop-out it may appear to be at first.  Indeed, it's rather subtle, in the way it neatly rounds off Father Karras's story.",9,2,4,11 April 2001
American History X," Let's not get carried away over this mediocre film
","This is the story of a white supremacist who changes his ways when someone points out to him that all his campaigning only served to make his life even worse than it had been before.  Well, yes.  He's in prison.  Other people at other times have been put in prison for waging battles they believed to be just; sometimes, the battles WERE just.  We wouldn't have wanted Hitler's opponents, for instance, to give up and go with the flow, just because that would have made their lives easier - would we?Moreover, Danny's racism had intellectual grounds.  When he goes into his rants he offers reasons - honest to goodness reasons - why others should believe what he believes.  Does anyone ever offer him or us opposing reasons?  Not that I noticed; instead, they look at him as they'd look at someone who spoke out of turn in church.  Those who agree with Danny will feel cheated, with reason; those who disagree will (or ought) feel even more cheated, with even greater reason.I haven't given you the full story.  While he's in prison, Danny actually MEETS a black man, for the first time in his life.  He changes his mind partly because he learns something, which is what prevents the film from being infuriating.  As drama, it's distinctly so so.  The characters are worth knowing, listening to, and following - even if the conclusion is an unmotivated cheat.Smack in the middle of Ordinary Road, that's where this film is.  I suspect it found its way onto the IMDb top 250 list not because anyone really loved it, but because nobody really disliked it.",5,7,18,9 September 2001
Ocean's Eleven," It turns out Soderbergh IS an artist, after all
","As in 'The Limey' and 'Traffic' Soderbergh will now and then (in the earlier films he did it all the time) use a visual gimmick that's pointless and ill-advised - like the useless, split-second split screen he introduces and then immediately drops during one casino sequence (why during THAT sequence, and not another?), or the jerky, stroboscopic motion of Danny and Linus running into one another on the train.  It's a pity.  Visually, 'The Limey' and 'Traffic' were ALL hollow gimmickry, which meant that no particular Jean-Luc Godard touch (like Godard, Soderbergh uses 'experimental' devices as though he's trying to patent them) did much harm - but the photography in 'Ocean's Eleven' is, at heart, simply wonderful: tinsel colours, beguiling bright lights, tight framing.It's not just the visuals.  Soderbergh's three previous films (the only other three I've seen) come across as mere exercises.  'The Limey' (the worst) appears to be a classroom assignment that accidentally saw the light of day; 'Erin Brokovich' is a formulaic commercial exercise; 'Traffic' is a propaganda exercise.  Soderbergh has said that in making 'Ocean's Eleven' he wanted to make a purely entertaining film, and the way he said made me think that he viewed it, too, as just another exercise, but it entertains so well and with such intelligence and grace that the artistry must be regarded as real.There's so much that's right that could not have been got right simply by accident.  The thieves are all civilised: the co-operate, and when they disagree, they disagree in a civilised fashion.  So many other directors would have made the tensions between them the point and driving force of the film - to give the film 'depth', perhaps.  But Soderbergh realises that it's eleven versus the casinos, and that factional warfare would neither complicate, nor deepen, nor enliven the picture.  These thieves really are cool and intelligent.  When Danny meets his ex-wife, he admits that his advice on her love life is neither disinterested nor unbiased, and then adds, '...but that doesn't mean that I'm wrong.'  He simply SAYS this, and Tess actually digests the comment and admits its force without being one over by it, and my God, can it be, is this an actual CONVERSATION taking place on screen?  Scenes that other films would have played up as contests or clashes of passion, this one milks for their value as dialectic.  It's almost a first.  THAT'S why the dialogue (which by and large isn't, alas, as clever as it should be) sparkles.And the heist itself is pleasingly clever.  It's a charming film.Spoiler ahead!Yet, as I said, the remaining flaws somehow gnawed at me.  The ending in particular.  Danny and Tess shouldn't have got back together - reaching an amicable understanding would have been better for both them and the audience.  And we shouldn't have seen them being tailed without, at the very least, being told whether or not they knew they were being tailed.  Trust Soderbergh to make two opposing mistakes at once: weakening the intelligence of the ending for the sake of sweetness, without actually making the ending any sweeter; then taking away the sweetness for the sake (I presume) of logic, without making the ending any more intelligent.",8,0,0,28 May 2002
Spirited Away," I defy you not to be enchanted
","I was surprised when 'Sprited Away' turned out to be every bit as wonderful as everyone said it was  one of the world's rare 'worth queueing for' films  because 'Princess Mononoke' decidedly wasn't. Yet behold! And my partner, who's somewhat harsher than me in referring to Miyazaki's previous film as 'Princess Monotony', was as enchanted as I was.I don't know how Miyazaki did it, exactly. He's created an altogether fresh fantasy world that doesn't come across merely as an all-too-laboured attempt to create an altogether fresh fantasy world. Describe it in words, and it sounds self-consciously quirky enough to put anyone off: it's a bath house for the spirits on the site of what appears to be a disused amusement park, presided over by an eccentric, mean-spirited old wizardess who's mother to a brat of an infant ten times larger than herself, the fires of which (the bath house, I mean) are stoked by a many-armed spider of a man who animates the soot particles to work for him ... and so on. It sounds like too much, too forced; but it unfolds on the screen naturally and magically, as though the world had simply been lying there, waiting to be discovered. And we discover it in exactly the right way (Miyazaki is a master story-teller, although I'd never thought so until now), through exactly the right protagonist: a girl who grows believably from a timid and clumsy outsider entirely reliant on the help and goodwill of others, to a confident (but still, no doubt, frightened) insider, able to help others in turn.Since this seems to be an issue, I should say that it was the dubbed version I saw. But I don't see why this should be an issue. I think that all the anime fans, in whose eyes Disney can do nothing right, who moan incessantly about how awful the dubbed version is, are having us all on. Don't get me wrong: I loathe dubbing. I think that, in general, subtitles are much to be preferred. But I also know that none of the arguments against dubbing, good though they are in general, happen to apply here. Dubbing is bad because it prevents the actors from really acting, from projecting their own words with their own bodies and vocal chords; but this can't happen in a cartoon in any case. Dubbing is bad because the match of mouth movements to words is never quite good enough; but this isn't live action, and it isn't even a Disney-style cartoon, with every sibilant, every quiver of the lip, lovingly captured by the animators in 24-drawings-per-second detail: Japanese animation is not and was never meant to be detailed in that kind of way, and I'll wager that the English soundtrack matches the lip movements about as well as the Japanese soundtrack ever did. Dubbing is sometimes bad because it's possible to dub something into a language that just doesn't fit, which MIGHT have happened here had it been an important part of the story that it take place in, say, Tokyo; but in fact it's set in an uncertainly located, almost surreal fantasy bath house; under the circumstances it doesn't matter in the least what language everyone is speaking. In short: just this once, you can go with the dubbed version (which, I might add, has been dubbed with both love and skill), and you needn't feel embarrassed about doing so.",10,4,8,29 April 2003
Pearl Harbor," The blockbuster disaster movie dumbed down. -Yes, exactly.
","What I liked especially was not the attack on Pearl Harbour but the Battle of Britain footage - confusing, as one would expect from Michael Bay, but it at least made aerial combat look three-dimensional, in a way I'd never seen it look before.But of course nobody involved in this film cared in the least little bit about the Battle of Britain.  'We need it for the plot, we might as well show it...' - the attitude was obvious and it made the footage lifeless. Everything preceding the attack on Pearl Harbour was just killing time. Well, I'd heard as much in advance.Imagine my surprise when it turned out that the Pearl Harbour attack was just as lifeless, and had just as much the quality of killing time, as everything that had gone before.  What's more, it seemed to last just as long.  Why were we watching bodies and things then more bodies and more things being blown to bits, again and again - for well over half an hour? More than once I wondered what was going on.  Not once does the camera pull far enough away from the digital pyrotechnics to show us how much damage the Japanese were doing, how they were doing it, what they were doing it to, etc.And that's the whole film in a nutshell.  It tells us NOTHING.  You could watch the movie from beginning to end and not realise, for instance, that Japan was ALREADY at war when the story opened.  It had invaded China and declared war on Britain (and all British colonies and members of the British Commonwealth). The US could reasonably hope to stay neutral, perhaps, but 'peace in the Pacific', which a few characters talked about, was past praying for.(There's a curious attitude to the Japanese here.  Obviously, they are the villain, because they WERE the villain - but we're never told why.  When we see actual Japanese people they look like brass monuments only recently granted the gifts of speech and movement, joyless in victory and they never saying anything that isn't in the form of a sententious proverb.  I see this as a conciliatory gesture towards the modern Japanese, although not a very subtle one.)Such things as why Japan wanted a war at all, or what they wanted OUT of war (not the same thing), or how they planned the attack and what they meant to do next, or for that matter what ANY nation was doing, are given the briefest mention, if any.  I know that this film isn't about military strategy, and it isn't about politics.  Fair enough.  But what IS it about? Surely not about how the war effects individuals.  The Ben Affleck has an almighty military raid fall directly on his head and it makes the barest perceptible dent in his self-absorbed resentment; he is exactly the same after Pearl Harbour as before.  So is everyone else, for that matter (excluding those who die).  When we watch the raid, does the camera linger in one place long enough for us to get a glimpse of any kind of personal reaction?  Never!  Maybe once or twice in the hospital, but to compensate the cutting is even more frenetic there than it is outside.  Unless you can weave it into a personal story or a political one, the attack on Pearl Harbour is completely devoid of drama.  The Japanese come, they bomb, they leave.So the ENTIRE FILM becomes a kind of a music video montage - pretty shot after pretty shot, Hans Zimmer's score indulging in a kind of pompous mourning over the top of them all, paying no attention to whether the people on screen are kissing or chatting or arguing or killing one another.  Even the conversations between characters are montages.  Listen closely.  The people in this film don't respond to one another, they navigate from one posture to the next.Ultimately the attack is over.  Michael Bay makes one desperate attempt to turn his collage of cinematic calendar shots into an actual film, by tacking on a phoney 'resolution'.  We see a raid on Tokyo (a raid that looks suspiciously like a pointless act of revenge, since nobody can clearly explain what it's meant to achieve).  Bay wanted a triumph at the end, however contrived - had the war not ended with something as chilling as atomic bombs falling on populated cities, I believe Bay would have fast-forwarded to 1945.  The raid is the occasion of some of the most mindless jingoism I've ever seen.  The Russians mastered the art of producing propaganda that seemed to have an effect on its intended audience even though it made no sense; 'Pearl Harbour' can't compete with that kind of thing, but the glowing eulogies at the end come dangerously close to collapsing into gibberish.SPOILER FOLLOWS...I must also register a protest about that display of competitive heroism on mainland China.  No doubt the pilots were brave, but their actions struck me as being of dubious legality.  First, they surrender; then, because they don't like the manner in which they're being made prisoners - admittedly with reason - they shoot their captors.  They would themselves have been shot had their captors not believed them when they announced that they were laying down arms.  The pilot's actions are difficult to admire, even if the scene was too ludicrous and choppy to have a moral viewpoint.he scene was too ludicrous and choppy to have a moral viewpoint.",Null,1,2,5 October 2001
The Usual Suspects," **** is ****, the **** who ****s **** because ????
","Hands up everyone who thought that the solution to `Murder on the Orient Express' was clever, fair and satisfying.  I see.  Two of you.  Hands up everyone who thought it was an outrageous cheat.  (The author raises his hand.)  Well, people in the first camp MIGHT think that `The Usual Suspects' is clever, fair and satisfying, even though it's even more of an outrageous cheat.  If you want a good twist, stick to old Agatha, or to those of her works that play fair - `Witness for the Prosecution' (1957) and `Endless Night' (1971) are particularly good screen versions - or try ... I don't know, any number of things.  `The Spanish Prisoner' (1997), for instance. It not only plays fair: it also paces itself correctly.  For that's the other problem with `The Usual Suspects' - we are fed no intriguing information whatever as we go along.  Even referring to the few surprises as `twists' is generous.  The film opens with a confrontation, followed by an explosion, on a boat, and from then on we listen to one of the characters narrating events leading up to this explosion - and he takes FOREVER.  It feels as if he's saying, `And then we had to kill a bit more time before we got to the boat exploding, so we robbed a bank.  Then we went to the beach.' If we weren't so busy glancing at our watches while waiting for the denouement, we'd be bored stiff.The ending had BETTER be worth it, we think - and it turns out to be one of the weakest (and did I mention it's a cheat?) in the history of cinema. Usually, after the killer revelation, our minds are abuzz.  `Of course!' we think.  `THAT'S why the ring was on her left hand - because if she hadn't been to France, where else could they hide the microfilm?'  But `The Usual Suspects' leaves one feeling flat.  There's nothing to think about.  While it's impossible to work out what happened, it's all too easy to come up with consistent theories about what happened, and any one of these theories is about as good as the rest of them.Damn it - I really want to play the Grinch who stole Christmas and TELL you what happens at the end, just so that you'll know I'm right.One final point - the title is an allusion to a line from `Casblanca'.  We can spot the allusion pretty early on.  Pay no attention to it.  It is NOT, as you might expect, a subtle hint to the audience; nor is it cunning misdirection.  It's just an attempt to be smart.",2,4,10,4 September 1999
Resident Evil," How bad does a movie have to be before the average horror fan notices it's bad?
","Like Anderson's previous work of science fiction horror ('Event Horizon'), 'Resident Evil' is overloaded with gore, even more overloaded with noise (Anderson seems to think you can't frighten people without deafening them), and doesn't try to make sense on any level whatever.  But there are some differences.  'Resident Evil' has art direction which deserves more than just pointedly looking the other way, and one (alas, no more than one) likeable character - although, it could just be that I find Michelle Rodriguez attractive, or that the character she plays is never given enough rope to hang herself.  On the debit side, there's a computer-animated monster which looks like a cartoon crudely pasted into live-action footage.The whole movie is a series of miscalculations, but one in particular stood out.  (Spoilers ahead...)  The gimmick is a thing called 'the T-virus', capable of re-animating corpses - in effect, creating zombies, which are almost impossible to kill and which behave so as to infect living individuals and create further zombies.  The T-virus was engineered in an underground research facility, and the instant the virus escapes, the central computer ('The Red Queen') seals of all exits and kills everybody, so as to contain the plague.  But since it didn't bother to tell anyone on the surface what happened (why not? Search me), half a dozen investigators find themselves underground, surrounded by flesh-eating zombies, one of their number infected with the T-virus, and trapped by the Red Queen, who refuses to let them escape.Here's the problem: I didn't want them to escape.  What's more, they shouldn't have wanted themselves to escape.  They were carrying a dangerous plague capable of destroying the world.  One reason I felt more sympathy for Michelle Rodriguez's character was that she was the only one willing to lay down her life - in a situation in which they were probably all going to die anyway, whatever happened - for the common good.  Nobody else so much as CONSIDERED laying down their lives for the common good.  The thought never entered their heads.  How can we be expected to sympathise with such selfish people?  I suppose it would have been easy enough, if we'd ever got to know any of them, but since we never did - since they were no more than vaguely unsavoury action movie stick figures - what little sympathy we have is entirely on the side of the unseen several million inhabitants of the city above.  That's where the movie's loyalties should have been, too.",Null,0,0,30 July 2002
Independence Day," We have only ourselves to blame
","I paid to see this in a cinema, too.  In my own small way I  contributed to its financial success.  Forgive me.  Forgive all of us.  This is the kind of movie we, the audience, have created.  Certainly I can't detect any creativity on the part of the writers.Parts are symptomatic of the whole: so I will practise restraint and mention just ONE glaring stupidity.  Just one.  Longer (but incomplete) lists of idiocies may be found elsewhere - the last time I looked there was a decent list on the IMDb itself.  Okay, here it is:The aliens take over our satellites and no-one knows why.  With the same creative reasoning he displayed in 'Jurassic Park' when he deduced a revolt of the dinosaurs from the movement of a water droplet, Jeff Goldblum works out that the aliens are using our satellites to communicate with each other so that they will be able to co-ordinate their attack.  'That's IT!' everyone shouts.  One wonders how the Allies managed in the Second World War.  Did they use German satellites - or did they simply synchronise their watches?  Here's a hot piece of technology we can sell to the aliens: the WATCH!  It's a little device that enables one to TELL THE TIME!  Everyone can have ONE EACH and then EVERYONE will know what time it is!My point is not that this is a stupid weakness in the plot.  I mean, it is, but that's not my point.  My point is that we REALISE just how stupid this is, almost before the words have left Goldblum's lips.  We aren't given a chance to be charitable about it.  A hundred weaknesses will make themselves apparent while you watch, however low you set the relevant dials in your brain (some people can go as low as 'dribbling moron', but most of us can't).  The movie just stumbles from stupidity to stupidity via bridge passages of stupidity.  There's a bit of purported excitement here and there to distract us from all the stupidity but it's so perfunctorily done that it just doesn't work.  Aliens taking over the Earth: it's a grand theme, but there's little grandeur in the treatment.  There is, however, an awful lot of stupidity.To make matters worse there's some offensive nationalism.  The aliens are threatening the ENTIRE EARTH - patriotism under the circumstances is a good thing, but it's the Earth (or humanity) as a whole that the tub-thumping ought to serve; not the USA in particular.  I've heard a rumour - probably false - I don't want to alarm anyone - that there will be a sequel.  What will they call it?  Bastille Day?",6,0,1,30 July 1999
Gone with the Wind," It's fun to see once ...
","... but that's the most I'll allow.  -OK, maybe it's possible to get some pleasure out of it a second time, or even a third.  It must be possible to do so: people have.  Many bad movies are like that.  We can debate how enjoyable this one was - it's always hard to tell, bleary-eyed, after four hours' viewing - but one fact beyond dispute, is that this is a bad movie.When it was first released the American Civil War was - just - within living memory of some of the audience.  It obviously spoke to United States audiences of the day. (What exactly it said, I have no idea.)  The universe is arranged so that whenever a movie does well in North America it does well everywhere else, and the same capricious forces of history that lifted 'Jaws' from the level success to the level of freakish statistical anomaly did much the same thing to 'Gone with the Wind'.  No other film in history can touch it.  No-one knows why.The truth is it was cranked out in a hurry.  The artists responsible were skilled and a few of them achieved great things, so it's not as ineptly put together as many other bloated successes; but there was little time for reflection; and no-one had the time to stand back and ask themselves just what the movie was meant to be about, anyway.  The best way of describing the plot is this: a lot of stuff happens to Scarlet O'Hara.  The illusion can be maintained in the first two hours or so that it's all going somewhere.  It isn't.  More and still more stuff happens until we drown in it.  The concluding scene, I feel, is only contingently the concluding scene; half a dozen or so earlier scenes would have done just as well.  A point was reached where no real ending was possible.  Any conclusion would look like a conclusion only by implicitly dismissing most of the previous footage as irrelevant.Apart from length and colours that make my eyes hurt there's no intrinsic quality that could have stunned the audiences of 1939 into submission. (It MUST have been the memory of the Civil War.)  The acting is surprisingly bad in places - the early barbecue scene, and indeed most scenes lacking Clark Gable, are neither stylish nor convincing; and, in most moods, hard to sit through.  Set design and art direction - all that type of thing - is good in places but inconsistent.  The music soars but it too shows signs of being cranked out here and there. (And was it ever: Max Steiner had to dope himself in order to stay awake for the weeks it took to compose.)  All in all the memorable moments are exactly as many as the workings of chance would lead you to expect - no more.",8,2,6,10 July 1999
Days of Thunder," Just this side of risible, but okay
","I don't know why I'm so kindly disposed towards this movie.  Maybe it's because Nicole Kidman was allowed to keep her Australian accent.  Maybe it's my reaction to injustice: this was much better than the god-awful `Top Gun', and yet the public clasped the latter to its bosom, and let the former die. Maybe the sheer volume of 1980s kitsch disarms me.  Maybe I'm just in a genial mood.Well, anyway: here's how it's better than `Top Gun'.  There's a story. Maybe you can see not only the ending but every aspect of it from much more than a mile away - considering the speed at which these guys are racing, I'd say from about 90 miles away - but it's a bona fide, reasonably good story nonetheless.  It's more mature than `Top Gun', for what that's worth.  Tom Cruise is less of an irresponsible hoon when he's simply risking his own life and a few thousand dollars of sponsorship money, than when he's risking his own life, several million dollars of public money, and the fate of nations.  Moreover there's a decent explanation for WHY he's an irresponsible hoon that makes us (me, anyway) actually like him.Now here's what's wrong.  The sport that all but one of the characters dedicate their lives to is `stock car racing', so called because each racer gets a stock car, pretty much identical to all the other cars.  There: now you know as much as I do, and I've SEEN the movie.  Nothing is as intrinsically dull as watching cars race each other - unless it's watching fighter jets move around - so the least they could have done was explain to us what's going on.  I notice that part-way through each race a car may stop to be serviced.  How does that work?  What kind of race is it where a driver can stop part way through and still win?  During the final race they casually let slip that Cruise has 45 seconds more he is allowed to spend at the pit stop before he's out of the race.  What's this time limit?  Where does it come from?  WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON?Clear exposition isn't helped by the photography, which makes a race track look much less ugly than it otherwise would, and even generates nice images, but obscures the narrative.  Scott, Simpson and Bruckheimer give us their beloved graduated tobacco filter shots whenever the sky would otherwise appear - does anyone else get tired of that?  But much worse is the CONSTANT use of telephoto lenses.  In almost every shot it looks as if the camera is on the other side of the stadium and not ONCE do we get an image of good explanatory value.  Still, as I say, they're nice images.  It's a nice enough movie.  But I won't go any further than that.",7,5,9,27 August 1999
Remember the Titans," Makes little sense, and yet...
","I've never seen a sports film where I understood the sports footage less. How are points scored in this kind of football?  Are there goals?  Are there goalposts?  (I didn't see any, but the action was all in extreme close up; I didn't see anything much.)  Does one score by simply placing the ball on the other side of one of those lines?  Must one PLACE it over the line?  Is throwing allowed?  Is kicking?  What's the difference between those who play 'offence' and those how play 'defence'?  And as for tackling - when is it allowed, when is it forbidden?  What does it achieve, anyway?  Are there penalties for fouls?  What form do they take?  Who's winning?  How can you tell?  What the HELL is going on?And you know, it's truly amazing how little my ignorance mattered.  They may as well have been playing some now lost Babylonian game - although such a game would probably be more comprehensible to the average modern viewer - for all the sense it made, but for once I didn't care.  This is the kind of film that gives slickly made, manipulative, fascist sentimentality a good name.  I loved it - even though I meant it when I said 'fascist'.  If the football camp failed to look like something Mussolini might have designed, that's just because the Italians were much more laid back.  (I suspect even the Hitler Youth were more laid back.)  But, well, you know ... there was all that stuff about crossing racial barriers, so somehow the nastier elements of the story didn't seem to matter such a great deal.  I suppose it's because the film, more than most of its kind, was willing to acknowledge the underside.  Boone got his job by unfair means.  He was brutal and arrogant.  He won the adolescents to his side by methods that could easily, in another context, have made our blood run cold.  Yet because the film made no great effort to deny any of this, or to hide it, it didn't leave the sour taste it might have.  We were free to concentrate on Boone's one redeeming virtue: he was the only character who was unracist from the very beginning.  (Actually, he's much less of an actual character than half a dozen other people in the movie - he's more a symbol, a mechanism of change.  This is just as well.  I suspect it's another reason why his virtue weighs so heavily with us.)'Cool Runnings' is a far superior Disney sports film (more humane, less mechanical), but this one somehow leaves just as warm a glow.",8,1,2,19 July 2001
Man on the Moon," Enigma, my foot
","Andy Kaufman's motivation isn't at all hard to understand.  We've all had the desire to play practical jokes.  We've all had the urge to say and do things that are, objectively speaking, funny, even though, and often because, we know that the humour will be invisible to everyone but ourselves.  And it's obvious us all what a good practical joke requires: it requires that we shut up and let others work out for themselves what the joke is, whatever the cost of our silence.  Andy Kaufman - the character portrayed in this film, at any rate - was simply someone who loved a certain kind of humour more than anything else in the world.  You've heard stories about people who love, say, music, more than anything else in the world...? Well, this is no different; certainly no more mysterious.Remember the moment when his agent says, 'You have to ask yourself this question: who are you trying to entertain?  The audience, or yourself?' Andy doesn't answer.  But the answer he would have given, had he been in a mood to be honest, would have been, 'Neither.  I'm interested in creating situations that are, objectively speaking, amusing - even if audiences are unable to laugh at them - even if I MYSELF am unable to laugh at them.'That's why it was worthwhile for Milos Forman to come along, after the dust had settled, and make Kaufman's life into a movie.  Some of the jokes are only visible to a God's-eye view.I walked into the film pretty much prepared to loathe Kaufman (whose stuff I've never seen).  Okay, the man probably had talent.  He was a skilled artist, of a kind.  Still: a skilled artist of almost any other kind would be more worthy of admiration.  But Forman keeps his distance, and simply asks us to see a genuinely tragic story of a human being who is somehow easy to like and - to us, if not to the other characters in the film - perfectly transparent.  (So much so that we have to wonder how it was possible for Kaufman's contemporary audiences not to know what was going on.  Are Americans REALLY as dense as legend says they are?  Maybe not; and anyway, Forman's frequent cut-away shots to the audience show a variety of different responses.)I could have done without that postscript with Tony Clifton; but the Philippines stint, and the funeral sequence it dissolved into, were marvellous.  Forman's best work since 'Amadeus'.",8,2,4,23 September 2000
The Princess Bride," Ah, yes ... The Princess Bride ...
","A dazzling tale of a princess, a peasant, swordplay, revenge, good and evil - so why does William Goldman feel it needs a frame story?  The frame story he uses in the novel is intrusive and, to be frank, pungently offensive; here he uses the more conventional device of having an old man tell the story to his grandson, which may be hackneyed but is nonetheless a distinct improvement.  At any rate it helps me understand why the frame story is there.  It's Goldman's way of announcing that he has a real corker of a story to tell - a story so superb that it's simply impossible not to be enthralled by it.  Goldman is daring us to find fault.  `My main story is SO GOOD,' he says, `that I can afford to encumber it with this irritating framing device, and it will STILL make your heart pound.  I can dare you to be indifferent and you'll STILL care.'And he's right.So are you ready for it?  Can you handle what Goldman is presenting as the Ultimate Story?  Then proceed - and I'd advise you to proceed with the film, rather than the book.",9,2,3,27 July 1999
The Transporter," The images say 'cinema'; the music says 'television'
","Style over substance? Not really. That's what happens when the director can't resist the temptation to include what he takes to be a cool-looking shot and in so doing makes nonsense of his own story or characters or themes. What we have here is style WITHOUT substance. There's no reason, all things considered, why the characters couldn't have been more involving as characters: there's nothing in the slick, zippy pacing, or the lovely golden photography, or the stylish French setting, or the cleverly conceived and choreographed fight scenes (for once, the word 'edgy' actually applies; there's something exhilerating about the way the editing is ALMOST too fast to defeat its own purpose, but not quite) ... there's nothing in all of this that COMPELS the characters to be ciphers.Partly for this reason it doesn't even matter very much that they are. The film's construction, down to the very rivets, is solid, so while a keener sense of everyone's motivation would be nice, the film doesn't really need this much to hold itself up. Remember, it does go beyond the call of duty in other respects. It opens with an exceptional car chase sequence, and the oil-wrestling scene (one of those things which everyone who's seen the movie is likely to talk about) shows how it's possible for the hero to plausibly defeat several bad guys at once in a novel way.My main problem (which also doesn't matter very much in retrospect) was with the music. 'The Transporter' may look and feel like a real movie, it may BE a real movie, but the music kicks in it sounds like a dodgy, charmless television cop show. This is not just an association of ideas. Music like this is inherently wrong for the big screen.",Null,0,1,14 March 2003
Lawrence of Arabia," I've never seen anything like this before ...
","I mean, wow.  Of the 72 films to have won a Best Picture Oscar, David Lean has directed two; and I suspect (but I'll let you know when I've seen them all) that his are the best two.  The other one is 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.  This is almost Kwai's companion piece.  In some ways Colonel Nicholson and Lawrence could scarcely be more different: the former is completely transparent, the latter utterly opaque.  But both films are studies in wartime leaders with unusual codes of honour.  Although both films are tragedies, 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a far greater tragedy: it's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' with all the optimism drained out.  It is terrible, sad, bleak, exquisitely depressing.  So why does it leave audiences feeling so exhilarated?  Why does one find oneself walking on air out of the cinema?  Simply, I think, because it's so very, very good.  Like Beethoven's music, it will thrill you even if it's in a minor key; possibly it will thrill you and sadden you at the same time; but certainly it will thrill you.The photography is so perfectly adapted to the wide screen that it couldn't possibly make sense on television.  Any network executive who screens this film has committed a crime.  I'm amazed how real everything looks: almost every shot is so convincing one thinks it couldn't possibly have been planned, yet so perfect, it must have been.  -But once I begin to praise the elements of the film one by one I will never stop.",10,0,2,15 June 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," These days people don't even bother to disguise the fact that they're just making the sequel for the money
","I can understand if they wanted to make another movie about dinosaurs, but why all those tedious links to Jurassic Park?  Why BOTHER resurrecting four of the old characters - the two kids, I note, make a three-minute appearance, cash their cheques, then vanish without a trace - just to let us know that this film takes place in the same universe as the previous one? It's not we were the slightest bit curious at the end of 'Jurassic Park' what would happen next to any of the old characters.  It's not even as if they're worth meeting a second time.  -Well, perhaps I could have lived through another outing with Sam Neill's palaeontologist, but nooo, instead I have to put up with Jeff Goldblum's unconvincing, insufferable, sunglass-wearing mathematician.  (Why him, Lord?  Why him?)  And the title - 'The Lost World' - adds insult to injury, for it suggests a far better dinosaur movie that might have been, based on Arthur Conan Doyle's book. Trust me: if they had made a dinosaur movie out of THAT 'Lost World' rather than Crichton's, it may still have been bad, but it couldn't possibly have been THIS bad.  (P.S.: Crichton had no right to pinch Conan Doyle's title.)Even allowing for Crichton and Spielberg their initial mistake the first half hour was poorly conceived.  Talk about leaden exposition.  Every character is given several paragraphs' worth of pointless, computer-generated back story.  Kelly - Dr. Ian Malcolm's daughter - feels as if Ian is neglecting his duties as a father, while Ian fools himself into believing that the important thing is to grant Kelly as much freedom as possible; similarly, in his relationship with Sarah, blah, blah, blah.  I DON'T CARE.  This is a story about the struggle between man and dinosaur. As soon as the razor-toothed beasties begin to stomp around all of these soap opera hand-me-downs will be forgotten anyway; during that ENDLESS first act they simply clog the film's arteries.  -When will people learn?  In a Human vs. Dinosaur story you reveal the humans' feelings towards one AFTER the dinosaurs strike; you let the external struggle illuminate the characters' inner lives AS THE PLOT PROGRESSES.  -I mean, there's nothing aesthetically shameful about external, physical struggles.  You don't need to import any of this human relationship stuff to make your film respectable.  But if you MUST do so, INTEGRATE IT! ... I can't say I was very impressed with the dinosaur bits, either.  Too many people on the island, too much random stupidity and movement ... and, as you will have heard, the action somehow shifts to San Francisco for the finale.  (San Francisco!  ...and it really does just SHIFT: it's not as if anything new happens.  In mid-dramatic-sentence, they pack up everything, including a tyrannosaurus, cart it all several thousand kilometres, then pick up where they left off.)  I must admit that the greater use of computer-generated creature footage, regrettable per se, was in keeping with the film's aesthetic: computer footage is cold and sterile, but I guess Spielberg wanted his dinosaurs to be no more than soulless killing machines.",3,1,9,4 November 2000
The Little Mermaid," Among the best fantasy films of all time
","The mermaid herself is charming.  She is animated with real passion - and voiced with real passion too, by Jodi Benson, who provides a powerful argument that whoever provides the speaking voice should also provide the singing voice.  She is an innocent heroine but by no means a colourless one. That the prince should fall in love with her, on just seeing her and hearing her voice, is entirely credible.The same could not be said for Andersen's original mermaid, who is a very cold fish indeed, solely concerned with grabbing immortality, considering the prince as no more than a handy means to it.  It's this (and the high value placed on Christianity at the expense of decency) that makes Andersen's ending so insufferable.  Obviously, another ending had to be found; and while it must be said that the big ending Musker and Clements came up with is a weak one, it must also be said that it's an improvement.Musker and Clements still have a problem with their finales (witness `Aladdin' and `Hercules'), but they have countervailing strengths, and those strengths are most apparent here.  The songs are all exceptionally staged (the well-known `Under the Sea' actually being the least effective), the comedy is sharp and well-timed, and - more obviously here than anywhere else - they really believe in what they're doing.  They give credit to Howard Ashman for this and they could be right; whatever the reason, an air of innocence and sincerity pervades `The Little Mermaid' which makes it - and her - utterly irresistible.",10,53,69,23 August 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Good - probably seems better than it is because we are so desperate for quality these days
","I appreciate the beauty of Lee's film.  I also appreciate the way he can keep his characters defying gravity, throughout the film, without the effect ever becoming stale.  Break the film down into its components and all seems good: photography, acting, music, story ... so why does it not even come close to the mythic loveliness of, say, 'Star Wars'?  I don't know.  Two things bothered me towards the end... ... which means that I'm about to reveal something... ... spoilers ahead...(1)  Li ought not to have died.  If Yu Jen had arrived in time to save his life, she would have succeeded in undoing some of the harm she had caused, and her repentance would have been less empty: she would have been able, by making a concrete gesture, to join the side of the angels.  Instead she does no good at all and merely feels remorse.  As a result everything after Li's death is anticlimax.  Yu Jen performs what I take to be the Eastern equivalent of becoming a nun, by running away to Wudan mountain, meeting a former lover who no longer matters to us any more than he does to her, then renouncing the world by leaping into a chasm.  Maybe Ang Lee's retreat into mystic tragedy would have worked if he had been sincere about.  Somehow it felt forced.(2)  This is not so much a problem with the ending as something Ang Lee ought to have cleared up at some point or other.  Jade Fox had some kind of grievance against the house of Wudan.  What was it?  We're told in a single line of dialogue that she was annoyed because Li's master had refused to train her, but this seems thin to me, especially since his decision was so clearly justified: training Jade Fox in the martial arts would be like handing an axe to a mentally unstable religious fanatic; besides, I presume that nobody is ENTITLED to be trained.  How much richer the film would have been had the house of Wudan REALLY wronged Jade Fox in the distant past, so that although her subsequent actions were completely unjustified, they were at least provoked by an initial wrong committed by someone other than herself.  -At any rate, I wanted to hear more about the nature of Fox's grievance, and whether it was justified. ...I don't want to sound sour.  It's still a beautiful film, the only thing wrong with it being that it doesn't reach the heights it is so clearly reaching for, most likely because Lee just isn't suited to epics.  'Eat Man Drink Woman' and 'The Ice Storm' - that's the kind of thing he does well.",5,2,3,25 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The earlier film was a disgrace; this one is even more of a disgrace.
","One hears a lot about the overwhelming majority of people who think otherwise (as if overwhelming majorities cannot be wrong), but I don't believe that this majority exists. Many of the people I talk to know full well how bad Jackson's films are, and most of the rest are ambivalent; moreover, as I watch the people walking out of 'The Two Towers', few are genuinely excited. Most of them look as though they've been bludgeoned into submission by crude overkill and sheer boredom. I'm sure many of these poor souls come to THINK they liked the film, but I think they're wrong even on this point.Before I launch into my attack (the film itself did nothing but attack ME for three hours; now it's my turn to attack IT), I'm obliged to point out that it does improve on 'The Fellowship of the Ring' in some respects. It looks better. Rohan really looks like Rohan, or if not like Rohan, at least like some place in particular (in the original, Jackson mixed unrelated and mostly unattractive locations with wild abandon), the CGI is marginally less offensive, and there is one (1) effective use of imagery: the bit in which Frodo's elven cloak makes him look like a rock. This is not to say that the film is on balance a visual success. The camera still swoops around too much (reminding one of a British Airways ad, and composer Howard Shore has obligingly written music to complete the effect), and the endless hordes of Nintendo creatures in the interminable battle scenes fail to look one tenth as thrilling as a real shot of a handful of real people standing on a real hill (when the camera stays still enough to let us get a good look at either, which isn't often).But let's look at some of the changes Jackson has made to the story and the characters. I'd like to make it clear: I don't object to changes per se. The day I say 'The Two Towers' I also saw 'Treasure Planet', which (disappointment though it was) was a far more intelligent adaptation of an original work  it moved the entire sequence of events centuries ahead and into outer space, yes, but it neither made complete nonsense of nor wilfully misunderstood its own story. It's the NATURE of Jackson's changes, not the mere fact that changes were made, that show us just how inept a film-maker he really is. Consider (spoilers ahead)(1) Faramir in the book finds out about the ring in a private conference between himself, Frodo, and Sam, and has the wisdom to let it be then and there; Faramir in the film decides to pounce on the ring immediately as extras run around behind, in front of and between the various parties, and he even binds the hobbits and drags them to Gondorso that we are forced to sit through YET ANOTHER tedious 'action' sequence before he changes his mind. One wonders: what's the point in even hiring two actors to play Boromir and Faramir, rather than one, if their characters are identical? And why not have Tolkein's quiet moment of truth in private, when we've already sat through more than enough sword-clashing? Not content by this blunder, Jackson compounds it, by letting us know that not just Faramir, not just the underlings he carelessly discusses state secrets in front of, but everyone of any consequence in Gondor, knows all about the ring. We're told that Faramir is LEGALLY BOUND to seize that ring, and that his life will be forfeit if he does not. 'Then it's forfeit,' he says, thrusting out his chest and waiting for the curtain to fall. No doubt these words sound very fine to thirteen-year-old Dungeons and Dragons players, but if Boromir was merely obeying the law on pain of death when he tried to take the ring, doesn't this make COMPLETE NONSENSE of all the earlier characterisation, such as it was (and destroy any sense we may have of the way in which the Ring corrupts genuine goodness)? Indeed it does.(2) The Ents, we are told, are 'not hasty' (and the film is concerned to make sure that this trait is played for cheap laughs). They deliberate at great length before deciding to remain neutral. Then  at the sight of destruction they knew about anyway  it takes them FIVE SECONDS to change their mind and go to war. (Five seconds is the time it takes all of them, collectively, to mount an invasion. Individual minds switch track more quickly still.) Does Jackson have the SLIGHTEST CLUE what he is doing?I could multiply examples easily: the contrived suspense of Aragorn's 'death', the intrusion of elves into those parts of the story where their intrusion makes no sense, the fact that the elves look like the kind of stormtroopers that vampires would have used if vampires had invented fascism, the bickering between Frodo and Sam and between Theoden and everyone. But it's not just the idiocy of these changes individually that worries me, but their effect collectively. Jackson says that his version of 'The Two Towers' is 'darker' than Tolkein's; for 'darker', read bloodthirstier, more cynical, more redolent of right-wing nastiness, less variegated. HIS world is one in which people squabble constantly, in which nobody has an unprompted noble thought or impulse, in which the forces of good have little left worth saving and in which power has little left worth the trouble of corrupting. It's the small-minded and mean-spirited work of a director who (as we know from a thousand flat-footed errors) is unable to handle a large canvas  whose mind is unable to encompass a large world containing more than one kind of thing.It's a disgrace.",3,1,5,2 January 2003
Schindler's List," Appreciate it - but do so for the right reasons
","Steven Spielberg was wrong about the subject matter of his own film.  It's no more `about' the holocaust than it's `about' Eastern Europe.  It's about Oscar Schindler.  More to the point: it's about an amoral small-time capitalist with neither more nor less compassion than most other people, who finds himself as surprised as anyone when cruel and unusual circumstances mould him into a hero.  It's about a man led to the path of morality as much by his belly as by his heart.  It's a study in the banality of goodness.  I don't know how many other people have used that phrase, but there's no better way of putting it.It's the job of documentaries, not fiction, to teach us about the past. `Schindler's List' is not a lesson about the what happened to European Jews under Nazi rule - at any rate, it's not a particularly good lesson.  It's fiction.  I'm not, of course, saying that it's false - I gather most of it is true.  Nor am I saying that it can't teach us a lesson of another kind. When Superman saves a thousand people we can always say, `That's all very well, but I can't leap tall buildings in a single bound; and anyway, Superman is supernaturally virtuous.'  When someone as flawed as Oscar Schindler saves a thousand people it's not so easy to make excuses.There's a good story here.  Many people do some of their best work in telling it.  I don't think that Neeson, Fiennes or Spielberg have ever performed better than they do here, and John Williams writes fine music in an understated style he hasn't used for a while.  But it's really the story that makes the movie.  Spielberg, in thinking that he's making a kind of documentary, sometimes lets the story down - every single use of colour is an intrusion, and anyone who's read the book will find that sections have been transferred flatly, with a palette knife, to the screen.  Probably this film has been praised a little more than it deserves.  Oh, well.  Excess praise will be washed away with time.One minor point: when the book was first published in Australia, it was called `Schindler's Ark'.  `Schindler's List' is the (inferior) American title.  Sadly, after the success of the film the book was called `Schindler's List' even here.  Spielberg could have called his film `Schindler's Monocle' - or anything at all - and publishers would have dutifully re-named the book.  It's a pity he didn't use his power to restore the original title.",10,9,13,7 September 1999
Amadeus," All biopics about creative artists are virtually identical - this one excepted
","Thank heavens there's none of that tortured genius stuff.  You know the line: X is a great composer, but what makes him great is that he pours out the innermost secrets of his soul when he sits down to write music, music which burns with blah, blah, blah.  Mozart here is a professional musician of abnormal talent, but his talent is no more a part of his soul than, say, his political beliefs are, and his character has neither more nor less depth than Salieri's does.  When Mozart suffers it's for the same mundane reasons that everyone else suffers.  This allows Forman and Shaffer, for once in history, to tell a different story about a composer.The legend of Mozart and Salieri is an old one now and this movie is really the story of the legend.  Considered purely as a legend it's one of the best stories I know of.  (Considered as fact it's false.  This makes no difference to the aesthetic worth of 'Amadeus'.  A legend is a legend.) Salieri is a mediocrity who ascends to some measure of success by dint of hard work and perhaps a little bluff.  Mozart is a genius who composes better music than Salieri ever could, without any effort.  Salieri's unique torture is that he is the only person who can see this - indeed, Salieri is in all respects the only clear-sighted person in the entire film.  Salieri is SO clear-sighted that when he later expresses the belief that divine intervention was responsible for some of the things that happened, I am inclined to believe him (in the film, that is; not in real life).  'I'm a vulgar man,' says Mozart at one point.  'But I assure you, my music is not.' Mozart really is intolerably gauche, but all in all no-one understands him so well as Salieri does.Many of the events seem like padding in retrospect but a particular kind of atmosphere has been so carefully built up that I'm reluctant to suggest that any particular scene was unnecessary.  One thing I think ought to have been omitted was the section detailing Mozart's 'vaudeville' compositions.  All it does is reinforce the most ridiculous and irrelevant of Shaffer's themes. Mozart's worth, Shaffer is saying, was best suited to and best appreciated by the lower orders of society, by the Common People.  Aristocrats just didn't have a clue and preferred to listen to stodge.  This (a) is a tiresome cliché, (b) is the complete reverse of the truth and (c) undercuts the pure beauty of the Mozart and Salieri legend to some degree (since it's essential that Salieri be the only person who realises Mozart's worth while Mozart is alive).This is a minor quibble.  Forman and Shaffer have so adroitly avoided the dreadfully hammy postures of classical music movies that I can forgive this inconsequential slip.  They've even avoided the temptation to simply quote all the best bits of Mozart's music.  Music is instead chosen for its dramatic effectiveness and appropriateness.  Compare 'Amadeus' to 'Immortal Beloved' in this respect.  'Immortal Beloved' merely has a better soundtrack.  'Amadeus' is by far the better film.",10,3,7,10 August 1999
The Game," If you can, see it for the second time, not the first.
","Or you can read on and let me give away the movie's secrets.  I don't really advise this.  I suspect you can't watch 'The Game' as if for the second time unless you really are watching it for the second time; reading about it in advance probably isn't good enough.  Anyway, in some sense or other, there are serious spoilers ahead.  You have been warned.The real secret, saved for the very end, is this: it really IS all a game, every minute of it.  CRS is exactly what it presents itself as being at the start.  Corollary: Nicholas is never more deeply deceived than when he thinks he's penetrated the illusion and discovered the true purpose behind the game.  The secret behind the game is that there is no secret behind the game.  It's all just a game.All very clever, but it makes for a deeply unsatisfying set of 'twists'. The real twist is that there ARE no real twists - and deep down, we sense as much.  There are only ever two possibilities before us: that things are as they appear to be to Nicholas at that time, or that it's all just a game; and since we're introduced to the possibility that it's all just a game right at the start, we can never really let go of that possibility, and consequently we can never feel particularly surprised at any particular revelation or supposed revelation - least of all the revelation that it's all just a game.  If we'd been given access to information Nicholas HADN'T been given access to, information which let us KNOW that it was all a game, the cleverness of the deceit would have been far more enjoyable.  And the movie's key moment would have come across far stronger.  If we'd been half-identifying with the illusionists at CRS all along, then when Claire (if that's her real name) stared in alarm at Nick's pistol, and says, 'You're not meant to have a real gun', this would alarm us deeply.  The moment would feel more like the climax it's meant to be rather than hurried exposition.  And - for just a moment - Fincher would have completely fooled us.  COMPLETELY fooled us.This doesn't happen, but as for the rest of the movie, see it for the second time and it's almost identical to the masterpiece it could have been the first time.  Which means that it damned near IS a masterpiece (it's certainly, without any contest whatever, David Fincher's best film), however invisible this fact may be to first-time viewers.",9,1,3,6 August 2002
Ghostbusters," Some things ARE as good as you remembered them being. Some are even better. This is neither.
","Were you roughly as old as I was (eleven; or let's say, no older than sixteen) when 'Ghostbusters' first came out?  Did you enjoy it then?  Has it been a decade or so since you last saw it?  If so, time for a revisit: you'll be surprised how bad it is.Such weak writing!  The humour is all in the wisecracks, but not one of them is memorable or (in itself) funny or in any way witty.  If we are fooled into thinking otherwise, it's due to Bill Murray.  It happens in every film he appears in (that is, those that aren't antecedently funny).  His character is cynical in the most innocent way, his delivery is impeccable, we really want his words to be amusing as well - so much so that we're prepared to pretend.The premise of 'Ghostbusters' is cool, too.  We want to be transported into a world in which there are ghostbusters of this kind, so much so that we're prepared to overlook the fact that we're watching fumbled comedy rather than successful fantasy.  Again, Bill Murray helps.  His I'm-game-for-anything character is the only one who seems to belong.Surprisingly good is Elmer Bernstein's score.  Strange how I hadn't noticed the general decline of film scores over the past seventeen years.  If it weren't for Bernstein and Murray, I doubt anyone would have taken 'Ghostbusters' seriously enough to even mistake it for a comedy.",5,13,27,22 January 2001
Coyote Ugly," Glossy - unfortunately, so are the women
","Had this been produced twenty years earlier, we would have seen bare breasts, the flesh would have looked more like flesh, the women would have looked less alike so that at least ONE of them would have been more attractive - perhaps she would have had a body as well as a face - and what we've lost in explicit detail and natural fleshiness, we have NOT gained in erotic presentation, although I admit that adolescent sex teasers of twenty years ago were by and large pretty poorly produced.  Decisions of who to cast and how much skin to show are now determined to the millimetre, it seems, by simple, cold algorithms.  There's no spontaneity whatever.  I'm aware how silly I sound in saying this, but if you must watch 'Coyote Ugly', don't do so for the chicks - watch it for the story.  It's another slickly produced, enjoyably formulaic tale from the Bruckheimer factory, and since the selling point is this time ersatz sexiness rather than ersatz violence, it's a good deal less offensive than most.  I was happy enough to cheer Violet on in her quest to break into the music business.  Why not?  But don't construe this as a recommendation.",7,0,1,14 March 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," Would have done better if it had had a different title
","I was going to make a few pedestrian complaints: you know, about the fake Russian accents, and the somewhat bald exposition and dialogue at the start... and also, and I think I really will complain about this, the silly title. Titles shouldn't have colons. Call your film 'K-19', or call it 'The Widowmaker'; don't try to have it both ways.But such concerns are washed away by what happens when the voyage is underway. Before it's over we're made to watch disturbing footage of sailors working away inside the bit of the reactor where ten minutes' exposure might not have been fatal if they'd been wearing radiation suits, which they weren't; we're also made to endure the sight of their their blistered flesh afterwards. It's hard going watching this. But here's the thing: at no point did I resent being shown this. We needed to see it, really, for the characters to have been treated with the proper amount of respect. Showing us the horrible nuclear scars is not gratuitous nastiness, not manipulation, but just a way of making sure that we get our taste of the natural consequences of the situation, too.I was forced to the conclusion that this is a film with very little in the way of false heroics. For the most part it's the real thing. Cold-war Russia, like the USA, was isolated from the world at large; the armed forces of both countries were (and are) isolated still further; and, as if more isolation is even possible, these sailors were effectively imprisoned on a secret submarine in the middle of nowhere. They're torn between fear of the immediate physical dangers facing them, fear of what the state could do to them even if they survive, and fear of nuclear war. No wonder their hands are inclined to shake. Bigelow gets all of this across and, more importantly, doesn't forget any of it just for the sake of getting a plot point or one-liner across.At least, she doesn't do so while the sub is at sea. If you were to start the film with the ship setting out and end it with ... well, the end of the voyage (I won't say how it ends), you'd have a faultless film. Alas, there's an epilogue. It's such a stupid one it's hard even to connect it with what has gone before.It ends with the same poisonous message of such standard modern-day hymns to the military as 'Black Hawk Down' and 'We Were Soldiers'. It's the 'we don't fight for cause or country, we fight for each other' spiel. I've heard this echoed so often by people who serve in the US armed forces (or claim to) it makes my blood run cold. A group of people are handed (in this case) a submarine capable of launching nuclear missiles, and we're asked to accept that it's a GOOD THING that the only obligation these people feel they have is to one another? The army is an instrument designed to kill people, and we actually want to LET it think that it's the only thing that matters? That it's above not only the law but morality as well?The preceding film makes nonsense of this. The crew of K-19 elect to submerge their ship and risk their lives rather than risk an accident which might see the United States retaliate against Moscow precisely because they DO have other things on their mind. These people, luckily, are human beings first and sailors second. So why is the prologue - which really begins with the military trial the officers face upon their return - even there? Why is it allowed to have precisely the same revolting flavour (watered down, thank goodness) that films subsidised and vetted by the Pentagon invariably have?I suspect so much of this drivel is being produced that it now finds its way into perfectly good films, like this one, by accident.",Null,0,1,23 March 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Baz, it's okay if a shot lasts for more than half a second - really, it's okay
","It's also okay if we hear more than sixteen uninterrupted consecutive bars of the one song.I don't want to give the impression that 'Moulin Rouge' is a bad movie, or even that I didn't enjoy it.  Of course I enjoyed it.  It's impossible not to.  But it's an entertaining trifle rather than ... I don't know, rather than whatever it was trying to be.  Luhrmann's earlier 'Strictly Ballroom' is probably more the thing 'Moulin Rouge' was reaching towards.  It has the same unbridled cinematic hedonism, but with more depth, more coherence, certainly more sincerity.  We're told more than once that this is a story of 'truth, beauty, freedom, and above all, love'.  But the film has little to say about freedom and nothing whatever to say about truth and beauty - those three were thrown in simply to make up the numbers.  Besides, what does the slogan MEAN?  When the Bohemians announce that 'truth' is one of their ideals, are they saying that one ought to tell the truth, or discover the truth, or face the truth, or are they speaking aesthetics, and saying something about art being true to life?  Your guess is as good as mine.As for the editing - did Luhrmann HAVE to disfigure his fine creative work so much?  A lot of the art direction is fantastic, but we can only find out that it's fantastic by a process akin to forensic science.  We never get an uninterrupted look at anything.  And even WITHIN the rare uncut shots, there's the appearance too much frantic cut-and-paste.  This is exactly what people feared would happen when editors started to use laptops rather than scissors.  With many movies it doesn't matter, but in this case Luhrmann could have made something special, if he hadn't put it through a blender.Don't let me dissuade you from seeing it (as if I could).  You're bound to have fun.  You'll be introduced to a lovely fantasy world (albeit one that feels only just large enough to hold the story Luhrmann tells), and there's no denying that the cast strain every muscle, nor that Luhrmann is inventive - and what's more, ambitious.  The film wouldn't be as good as it is were it not for his admirable desire to make a lavish masterpiece along the lines of, and worthy of being placed alongside, such films as 'The Children of Paradise' and 'The Red Shoes'.  But has he succeeded?  Not even close.",4,0,1,8 September 2001
Back to the Future Part III," THE STORY SO FAR ...
","Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels with his wacky inventor friend thirty years into the past, where he changes his father from the doormat he was in 1985 into a strong and assertive man, except he makes it the case that his father was never a doormat in 1985, so the first part of the film didn't really happen, except that it did.  That accomplished, he goes back to 1985 and his wacky inventor visits the 21st century.In the 21st century, the wacky inventor learns that something terrible will befall Marty's son (Michael J. Fox) and his daughter (Michael J. Fox), so he recruits Marty's help to make sure that it doesn't happen, so the wacky inventor can't hear about it, and therefore can't prevent it.  He also casually mentions that if too many more impossible things happen then perhaps the whole universe (Michael J. Fox) will explode.  Luckily, it doesn't.  With pluck and daring, Marty succeeds in preventing the future tragedy that caused him to prevent it, but inadvertently changes the past so that the events of the entire first movie didn't happen, except that they did.  When they discover what has happened, except that it hasn't, Marty's wacky inventor friend comes up with a theory that might make sense of it, except that it doesn't.  But with pluck and daring, they set everything back the way it was, except that it's also the way things have always been.But now the wacky inventor is stranded in the 19th century.  All pretence of consistency abandoned, Marty must use pluck and daring to prevent his ancestor (Michael J. Fox) from making it the case that his future self...Ah, forget it.",8,1,8,14 December 1999
Men in Black II," I love the opening credits.
","Where did they find that font? I want it. In white, sprawling generously over shots of stuff happening in outer space, it's more than attractive; it's positively intriguing. I'll go so far as to say that the opening credits sequence could well be the handsomest of any released in the year 2002.It ought to be. It's clearly where all the effort went. The film itself has us glancing at our watches and saying, 'Yeah, whatever,' almost before the first line of dialogue is spoken.Tommy Lee Jones's character has been pulled out of retirement on some phoney pretext, and he too looks bored (certainly he goes well beyond deadpan). He virtually yawns as he delivers the final 'revalation'. It's as though he's simply making it up with the camera rolling, not caring much what he says, but knowing that whatever he says, everyone else will be forced to play along, and then it will be over, and we can all go home.I must admit I've never fully understood the appeal of the first film, but it's clear that Barry Sonnenfeld understands it even less. It has something to do, you can hear him thinking to himself, with Tommy Lee Jones looking deadpan, Will Smith wearing sunglasses, and aliens. Very well then: three times as much of each for the sequel. Cram them gimmicks in. Never mind that whatever appealed to us about Jones and Smith's characters has been lost  EVERYTHING about their characters has, in fact, been lost  and that the aliens, underneath their brash, zany schtick, are all crushing bores.Rosario Dawson is as lovely as she was in the vastly superior 'Josie and the Pussycats'. She's easily the best thing to happen to the film. She tries to make us feel that it's more than a big goof-off, and while the attempt comes across as just one more cynical ploy, SHE does not. I'm in love.",Null,0,1,21 January 2003
Rules of Engagement," Morally disgusting, fundamentally confused, poorly constructed, blatantly manipulative.
","Let's take those points in turn.(1)  Okay, killing 83 civilians and injuring 100 more is something that can happen to anyone; what's amazing is that Terry Childers feels neither remorse nor regret.  He's surprised that he's even being tried.  (He's not, it must be said, the brightest of men.)  His defence?  When he deigns to justify his actions to people who haven't themselves killed anyone, all he can say - although he says it with an amazing tone of wounded moral outrage - is, 'They killed ... THREE ... MARINES!'  Oh, well, in THAT case ... I mean, it's not as if the 83 Yemenites were MARINES.  (By the way, I wish the Americans would drop that ridiculous word, 'marine'.  It makes it sound as of some of their soldiers have gills.)  It's obvious that the film shares Childers's attitude.(2)  And yet, and yet ... Friedkin doesn't hesitate to give us lingering shots of all the dead and wounded civilians.  What is he saying?  'Yes, this is tragic, but...'  But what?  He doesn't have anything to say after the 'but'.  It's as if he thinks he can show the people of Yemen respect by offering them screen time - the more screen time, the more respect.  -And another thing: if Friedkin has any idea what he thinks the trial was ABOUT, I wish he'd let us know.  Does he think that Childers is technically innocent on all three charges?  I'm glad someone is in a position to tell; we're certainly not, since we never find out in enough detail what the legal issues are (what kind of conduct IS 'conduct unbecoming a marine'?), and anyway, this is one of those grandstanding trials in which neither side makes a coherent case, or wants to.(3)  Do we care what happened 28 years earlier in Vietnam?  Do we have reason to care?  Of course not.  This lengthy prologue is there simply to make the film seem twice as ridiculous (Tommy Lee Jones looks, if anything, older in 1968 than in 1996; the statement 'If you call off your men, you can go free; you have my word.  If you don't, I swear I'll kill you where you stand!' gets translated into just five syllables of Vietnamese), and to give characters 'a past', as if any old past will do.  The trial begins at precisely the wrong time: just when our exhaustion with all the setting-up has led us to believe that the end of the film can't be far off, but early enough so that it feels in retrospect as if the film is all trial.  It would be better if it really were.(4)  As for 'blatantly manipulative', where do I begin?  With the soundtrack?  You know the kind - muted snare drums, more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger solo trumpets ...it never varies from one piece of American military sentimentalism to the next.  (This particular score is due to Mark Isham, but I can't blame him.  I'm sure he had no choice.)  Or how about the ambassador, who we see snapping petulantly into the phone, hiding under the table, and - gasp! - forgetting to take the American flag with him when he leaves.  Gee, I wonder if he'll turn out to be a coward?  And what about his son, who steals screen time solely in order to look up with his big puppydog eyes and ask some, faux naïve, mummy-why-are-those-people-shouting-at-us questions?  Then there's the trial, with a charm-laden Tommy Lee Jones defending and some bug-eyed weevil prosecuting....  How much more effective this trial would have been if the prosecutor had had, at the very least, silkiness - if he hadn't been someone who could be counted upon to lose the case simply by rubbing the jury the wrong way.  Bah.",4,13,20,27 March 2001
Event Horizon," There's a difference between darkness and blackness.
","Darkness is frightening, because we don't know what it contains.  Blackness isn't frightening - it's just ugly and off putting, like the flourescent greens that also figure so heavily in the colour scheme, like the sudden loud noises and the lascerated flesh.  'Event Horizon' doesn't know the difference between scary, startling, and sickening.But what makes the film really bad is the complete absence of characterisation.  How many people were aboard the rescue ship to begin with?  Five?  Ten?  If only I'd counted.  There's the ship's hubristic scientist - so utterly lifeless a hubristic scientist that I bet if you were to tap him on the shoulder and ask, 'Why did you do what you just did?' he would look puzzled and reply, 'Because I'm the hubristic scientist.' Similar remarks apply to the jivin' black guy, and to the tough but capable captain (although he, out of everyone, comes closest to being an actual character).  Everyone else on board is utterly unmemorable.  Is this better, or worse?  Hard to tell.  I think Laurence Fishburne's captain is easier to take than the average faceless crew member; Sam Neill's scientist is much harder.Don't think for a minute that I'm blaming the actors.  It's the script.  No more than half of the lines CAN be delivered with conviction, so no more than half are.  The cast spends most of its time shouting at one another, explaining things (in a sort of a way) to the audience, and wandering off suddenly to investigate this or that without telling anyone only to come back having forgotten whatever it was they had been doing before they left. It becomes tiring after a while, watching conversations you know won't lead anywhere because they'll be forgotten as soon as the camera turns to something else.P.S.: I can't help noticing that an earlier reviewer tells us that if we don't want something scary and suspenseful we should watch 'Bambi' instead. He can't have seen 'Bambi' recently.  Concede for the sake of argument that 'Event Horizon' is scary; still, 'Bambi' is far more suspenseful.  One cares whether or not Bambi survives.",1,9,19,10 August 2001
The Nightmare Before Christmas," The triumph of stop motion
","There's life in stop motion yet.  Burton and Selick's film is a fine retort to `Toy Story'; or at least it would have been if `Toy Story' had been made first.  Fluid, three-dimensional animation in a completely designed world - that's what the two films have in common, but `The Nightmare Before Christmas' looks undeniably better.  Partly it's the more imaginative art direction.  Partly, also, it's just the fact that there's something enervating about digital effects, and something special about using real, physical artwork, and photographing it.  I don't know how well the world of Halloween will stand up over the years, but no-one will forget what it looks like.The plot alarmingly resembles that of a Rankin/Bass TV special, but with more teeth.  Jack Skellington, ruler of the land of Halloween, falls in love with the land of Christmas, and decides to conquer it.  The difference between `Nightmare' and its dismal TV cousins is that the land of Halloween really is a grisly place.  (Gorgeous, but grisly.)  Jack Skellington is a gentle ruler with an imperfect hold on power.  (Santa Claus, by contrast, is not quite the innocent he appears to be.)  It all ends a little too soon: I would have liked to see more attention paid to the story after all the fun scene-setting.  Still, it's a delicious movie.",10,7,10,30 July 1999
Mulholland Drive," A promisory note for an explanation scarcely worth the effort of looking up
","I was among those whose first reaction was 'What the HELL was that all about?'  But I didn't stop there.  I cheated.  I looked up the answers. Believe me, you don't want to know what I found out; the solution to all the riddles is remarkably dull.  The only reason I couldn't have worked them out by myself, I think, is that I would have found it difficult to stoop so low as to come up with such a banal, catch-all explanation.But for form's sake: beware, spoilers ahead.The key is this: it's more or less all a dream.  Yes, I know: people say that about 'Lost Highway', too, yet anyone who has seen that movie and seriously thought about it knows they're wrong.  The 'alternate version' of the protagonist in 'Lost Highway' is best thought of not as part of a randomly meandering dream, but as something real: a psychic projection of the hero's evil nature, or a doppleganger, or some such.  (My money's on the first option, but whatever.)  The horror in 'Lost Highway' is that when the hero 'turns into someone else' he really DOES turn into someone else; but here, the heroine merely 'turns into someone else', i.e., fantasises about it.  Big deal.Nor is there any interesting explanation as to why these particular events form part of her dream, rather than other events.  This second failing is just as serious as the first.  Even if the vast central section of 'Lost Highway' WAS all a mere dream, which it wasn't, there's still a cogent reason why any particular part of the dream is the way it is, determined by the parts of the story that AREN'T dreamt.  Not so here.  Why is the cowboy, someone Diane glimpses briefly at a party, such a sinister and powerful figure in the dream?  No reason; he might just as easily not have appeared in the dream at all, and the role he played in the dream might just as easily have been played by some other randomly chosen person, or not played at all by anyone.  Why is the blue box so important?  No reason; it might just as well have been a blue elephant, or a toenail clipper.  What's the significance of the face behind Winkie's who's 'controlling everything'? None; he's just some homeless guy; even in the dream, he's a red herring.Even leaving all this aside it's clear that this is a thin and flat film, a surprisingly bad and badly made work from someone whose previous two efforts ('Lost Highway' and 'The Straight Story') had both been superb.  Nothing stands out.  It's as if Lynch is chewing used gum - and the reason for this, I think, is that the movie is all about Hollywood.  'Lost Highway' awakened real fears.  'Mulholland Drive' is something remote from any interesting human experience or human fantasy, full of actors and directors and agents, whom Lynch (being too close too) can't bring himself to be honest about, and people outside Hollywood can't recognise.  Lynch is a strong enough director to make such material okay, marginally above average, sort of worth watching if you're in a charitable mood, but that's all he can do.",7,1,5,10 August 2002
8 Mile," We have a new winner.
","'8 Mile' has recently won the most questionable Oscar of all time.The worst that can be said of previous Oscar decisions is that they've been aesthetically misguided: 'Hamlet' (1948) being awarded Best Picture despite being inferior to 'The Red Shoes'; 'Forrest Gump' winning the same award despite being no good at all; that type of thing. There have also been one or two doubtful procedural decisions. Denzel Washington won Best Lead Actor even though he wasn't, in fact, the lead actor of the film he won the award for - but whether or not he was the lead is itself an aesthetic judgment, of sorts, and anyway, it's ARGUABLE that he was the lead, at least to the extent it's arguable that the musical score of 'Chariots of Fire' is superior to that of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.But declaring 'Lose Yourself' to be the best song is to make a simple mistake of classification. 'Lose Yourself' is not a song. I'm not saying anything against it here. I'm sure it's a very fine piece of rap (and I'm not saying this in a patronising way - I really AM sure it's a fine piece of rap, and what's more, I find myself liking it), just as I'm sure that 'Kubla Khan' is a fine poem. But anyone who calls either work a song has failed to grasp the meaning of the word. Songs are sung. Rap is rapped. To rap is not to sing.If I loathed rap in an exaggerated way before seeing '8 Mile' it was probably because it had been sold to me as music, and while some (but not all) rap may in fact be music (in a borderline kind of way), its virtues are not musical virtues; and even the most musical rap comes nowhere near to being a form of song. '8 Mile' wisely leaves the music side entirely out of it. The impression we get of Detroit here is of a city alive with an artform unlike any other, one combining verbal and vocal dexterity, timing, rhythm, and the ability to cultivate a kind of false truculence. And Rabbit does it differently again. For most of the film he comes across as being inferior to many of those around him. His friends and enemies alike have smoother, more relaxed, in almost every way more impressive delivery; Rabbit comes off as being detatched and studied, so much so that he's almost embarrassingly awkward at first, although his style shows its strengths towards the end.At least one reviewer claims that '8 Mile' shows Eminem not to be honestly expressive after all, and he's right. That's what's refreshing about it. The idea that art should be expressive of the artist, or that the best art is on average more expressive than the worst, or that more expressive art is on average better than less expressive art... well, some of these claims MAY be true, but we'd need to conduct a cunning statistical survey in order to find out. It was the claim that it was 'expressive' that helped turned me off rap in he first place. I thought I was being told to like bad music on the grounds that (like an anguished scream) it expressed something. '8 Mile' shows me that some rap is not so much bad music as good something-else, but rap as a genre probably includes a lot of bad something-else, too, and that stuff is no doubt expressive, too. I like the fact that Eminem's closing song says 'lose yourself', not 'express yourself'.I still feel it's something of a waste of a film to give us this vision of Detroit, sketch out for us the virtues and nature of rap, and then mold the material into no particular form, not even that of a struggling artist eventually making it. The story progresses from the point at which Rabbit has stage fright to the point at which he no longer has stage fright. That's it. A lot of other story strands must go nowhere in order for so much good film-making to come to, compared to what's promised, so little.Despite what you may have heard there's nothing wrong with Eminem's performance. It may be that this is the only role he can play at all, but so long as he plays it well, what business is this of ours?",Null,1,2,24 March 2003
Jerry Maguire," Down with chick flicks
","I thought this was supposed to be about a sports agent.  What's Renée Zellweger doing there?  What's that unendurable kid doing there?  I can just HEAR the cynical clanking of gears in the writer's mind.  `Okay - so the average member of the audience will simply fall asleep when we show it the story of an ethical quest.  Look how Quiz Show' fared.  So we'll write this quote, love story, unquote, one that has NOTHING WHATEVER to do with the basic plot, and we'll make the hero go through both the love story and the real story simultaneously.'Only it's worse than that.  Jerry Maguire undergoes his change of heart too early in the film - all we find out about him beforehand is that he's the kind of person with a conscience on the point of rebellion, and then - surprise! - his conscience rebels.  We don't see how he became corrupted in the first place or how he escaped corruption in the end.  Well, maybe we'll see some more of this corruption-in-the-sports-agency theme later.`Well sorry,' says the writer, `screen time is limited, maybe I can spare half an hour from my contrived and sappy romance, but I tell you what: I'll let you watch Cuba Gooding, Jr. bellowing at people in a zany fashion. That's vaguely to do with sport, isn't it?  After all, he's a -' (consults notes) `- football player.'Finally - SPOILER AHEAD - I have one more question for the writer.  I don't know much about American football (apart from the fact that it's STUPID), but when Jerry urges Rod to play in such away that he swings through the air and lands smack on his bare skull ... how is that any different from what he does to the bedridden footballer, at the start of the movie?  I mean, he makes the bedridden footballer risk concussion in the pursuit of money, and Rod risk concussion for the love of the game, but in either case the result is concussion.  And what is Rod's reward?  He gets to make a zany-antics ad for one of those reptilian sports shoe companies, in exchange for a fat cheque.  Nope - no naked greed there.",4,12,32,14 December 1999
Mission: Impossible II," A curious mix of good and bad. Good wins.
","I know the criticism I'm about to make is not a deep one, but really: it would have cost them NOTHING to make the medical science more plausible, so why didn't they?  Inaccuracies range from those research would have cleared up (viruses use RNA, not DNA), through those a moment's thought would have cleared up (how can a virus which is fatal in less than two days, and almost impossible to transmit, cause an epidemic?), to those which are just loopy (how can there be a disease which becomes incurable after EXACTLY twenty hours, to the MINUTE, whatever the sex, size, age or initial state of health of the person infected?).Anyway: it's still amazing stuff.  All that heart-stopping rock climbing at the beginning and slow motion photography - PROPER slow-motion photography, which never feels as if it's dragging its heels. At once exhilarating and suspenseful.  My only previous exposure to Woo had been the execrable 'Face/Off'.  It goes without saying that this film is a hundred times better.  (It IS a mystery to me why people were so excited about it in advance: as I said, Woo's previous Hollywood effort had shown no grounds for hope at all, and it's not as if anyone liked the original 'Mission: Impossible'.  I guess it's one of those hype things I'll never understand.) -Sure, the token woman was very hard to take: an unlovable drifter of no fixed abode or accent, and if she was REALLY in love with Ethan Hunt, I renounce any claim to being able to read anyone's state of mind.  And some of the lines ... dear oh dear.  I don't think the gliding, enfolding cinematography EXCUSES these faults, but it's more than enough to make the film worth watching.",7,1,2,4 November 2000
Black Hawk Down," The hypocrisy...!
","Not just of the movie, but also of its defenders.'Save your political commentary for another website,' says one reviewer, who goes on to add, 'Don't dishonor the memory of those who fought and died in an attempt to stop bloodshed and starvation among the Somalis' and 'the personnel of our armed forces secure our freedom day in and day out' and 'I'm grateful to our soldiers that have sacrificed for our nation so that I can type these words'.  (I presume this last reference is to the US soldiers who fought in the Second World War, rather than the ones who fought in Somalia, but you never can tell with someone who believes with apparent sincerity that the United States army is securing 'our' freedom 'day in and day out'.)Actually, political commentary (yes, even the sort of stuff quoted above) IS appropriate here.  This is a movie that opens with the words 'based on an actual event' followed by a series of statements that purport to give an accurate history of what had been going on in Somalia at the time of the events the movie depicts.  It closes with a statement of fact and a list of names.  It's a hybrid work, NOT pure fiction, and not automatically immune to charges of inaccuracy in the way that pure works of fiction (like 'Star Wars') are.  Some charges of inaccuracy (or confirmations of accuracy) will take the form of 'political commentary'.  There is just no way around this.One can't even say, in defence of the film, that we should ignore its documentary pretensions and enjoy it as if it were a work of pure fiction. It can't be so enjoyed.  Almost all of the footage is in the form of a music video montage of gore, explosions and rushings to and fro; if this were a movie about an imaginary war between two made-up countries, nobody would give it the time of day.  (Contrast this with something like 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', which is further removed from reality, but less likely to deceive - and in addition, thoughtful, imaginative, even-handed, suspenseful, well crafted, etc.)By the way, my impression is that the majority of people here who object to the film on the grounds that it's deceitful have not only read the book, they object to the film BECAUSE they've read the book.  That's because the book was written in an honest attempt to enlighten its readers and tell the truth, while the film was a flimsy excuse for two hours of cool-looking (in a Ridley-Scottish kind of way) war porn.Also by the way: if speaking the truth about America's involvement in Somalia involves 'dishonouring' American soldiers who fought there - not that I have a clear idea what this word means - well, tough luck; we should speak the truth anyway.",2,13,25,30 July 2002
Black Hawk Down," Two-thirds glamourised carnage, one-third whitewash
","'It tells the story from the soldier's point of view'; 'It shows us what it was like to be there' ... at least, that's what we hear from people who want to excuse Ridley Scott's myopia and shallowness.  Not so.We aren't told the story 'from the soldier's point of view', because we aren't told the story, period.  Nor do we really get the soldier's point of view.  Scott shows us ample footage from the point of view of the odd Somalian sniper, and from the point of view of command central, and (albeit rarely) from the point of view of a civilian, and from no particular point of view at all; he focuses just as much on what the soldiers aren't looking at as he does on what they are looking at.  There's an unmistakable attempt to pull off a god's-eye perspective.  It doesn't succeed.  Actually, it's more as though Scott found himself in the middle of a REALLY COOL war, and he photographed all the REALLY COOL stuff around him as though he were shooting a beer commercial, making a mental note to edit it all later.  Then he edited it as though it were a beer commercial.  And who's surprised? That's how he makes all his movies.That's why the movie fails on the second count, too - showing us what it was like to be there.  There's no 'what it was like' anywhere in this film. Actual soldiers who fight side by side can, at least when staring one another in the eyes at a distance of half a metre, recognise one another, which is more than we can do without straining our eyes and struggling to remember if this is the guy who makes coffee or the one who made that phone call earlier, you know, the one next to the pin-up - assuming the coffee guy and the pinup guy were distinct, which isn't certain.  Besides, ANY real life event has a continuity missing here.  Maybe the soldiers were as confused as I was about what was going on, but they couldn't have been as confused as I was about what (at any one point) they were trying to do.  The early parts of the mission, in which everyone knew what was going on and what they were doing, are shot in precisely the same bewildering, arty, choppy fashion as the later bits, in which the bewildering, choppy artiness is allegedly meant to convey the soldiers' own confusion.  I don't buy it.Moreover, there's clearly an attempt to provide some political context at the beginning - or more accurately, a pretence.  Now, I don't demand political context.  A good film could be made - possibly in the vein of Kafka's 'The Trial' - in which we don't know what the war is about or how it started or what the soldiers were doing there.  But if you're going to TRY to tell us the story, or ACT as though you're telling us the story, then it's as well to get it RIGHT.  The half-a-dozen sentences of context at the beginning are completely unhelpful.  And misleading, if not actually false. The Americans weren't there to provide famine relief.  They weren't, as the film obliquely suggests, obstructed in any way by UN troops - in fact, the chutzpah of the Pentagon, who had control over the script, claiming such a thing, blows me away.  Twenty-two countries obediently pooled their forces under United Nations command, but the United States, as always, refused to do any such thing - partly to leave the US army free to indulge in whatever war crimes it pleased.One or two moments are unintentionally revealing.  A fresh soldier arrives and innocently refers to 'Mogadishu', but an older hand immediately corrects him: 'Firstly, it's 'The Mog'.  Nobody calls it 'Mogadishu'.'  No, nobody, except perhaps the people who live there.  If troops from a foreign power were to walk around my country as though they owned it, terrorising the locals (accidentally, according to the film, although there's ample evidence that much of it was deliberate), I would still find it an added insult if they were to contemptuously refer to our capital city as 'The Can' and to other cities as 'The Syd' and 'The Melb' - unless they were inspired to do so by local practises, which, something tells me, wasn't the case here.Then there's the note at the end.  It says: '...over 1000 Somalis were killed and 19 Americans lost their lives.'  (That's a ratio of 53 to one.) The Somalis were 'killed', the Americans 'lost their lives'; Scott doesn't even have the grace to say something even-handed like, '1000 Somalis and 19 Americans were killed.'  In case the double standard weren't obvious enough, we see a LIST of the 19 dead Americans (but not, of course, the Somalis). For a second I suspected that Scott was being subtle for the first time in his life, and that this sick joke was deliberate.  Then I remembered the rest of the film and thought: no, probably not.",2,11,23,25 July 2002
A Bug's Life," 'An epic of miniature proportions' ... that's the problem
","So far as appearances are concerned, 'A Bug's Life' is superb.  The art direction stylises the world of rural insects subtly but surely; and, although I can't help thinking it was a mistake to include any evidence of HUMAN civilisation, that was beautifully done, too. And I applaud the courageous decision to avoid pointless sophistication when designing the insects themselves: they have exactly the robotic design one would expect of creatures with exoskeletons, they move with a minimum of squash and stretch, yet they are not at all lacking in humanity.  Any aspect of the visuals I have forgotten to mention probably deserves praise, too. (With the possible exception of the ladybug design.)That aside, this is a ninety-six minute film that wants to be three hours in length. Compression has wrenched it out of shape.  It's a mess; and the computer-generated equivalent of fine camera-work and competent performances can't save it.  With a film that tries to do so many contradictory things with its allotted time it's difficult to know where to begin.Take Flik, the social misfit who makes good. Many of the crimes for which the colony rejects him are, in fact, serious ones: he DOES lie to them, he DOES wreak real havoc, he IS dangerous. This shouldn't stop him from being a sympathetic hero, of course. But it ought to give us pause. If his failings are real, which they are, and integral to the plot, which they are, they ought to have more than a few seconds of screen time devoted to them. Ideally, they ought to be resolved.Or take the civilisation-versus-barbarians theme, which the film's climax retrospectively underlines, but which is hardly even mentioned beforehand. Or take the relationship between Flik and the princess, which is never defined, which changes from scene to scene, but which, we are led to believe, is a central part of the story. What IS the story, anyway? It's hard to see for all the sub-plots. Or for all the characters. I don't object to crowding the world with so many characters and then paying attention to each of them in turn, but it takes a lot more than 96 minutes to do this kind of thing properly.Despite trying to do too many things at once and doing none of them well, 'A Bug's Life' has some thrilling moments.  It's because of them that I'm reluctant to dismiss the film as a turkey -- well, let's be fair, a chicken -- in peacock's feathers. It's not that the film is positively BAD: it's just that it fails (visuals aside) to be positively good, as it's so obviously trying to be.One last note: I know people liked the 'bloopers' at the end, but having seen 'Toy Story 2', I think they were a mistake.  The gag suited the Toy Story world better. Toys are MEANT to be part of games of make-believe: they are 'acting' almost all the time, so treating them as actors in the end credits doesn't jar. It sure jars in 'A Bug's Life', though.",7,0,3,1 January 2000
Quiz Show," A study in ethics
","Although `Quiz Show' is entirely concerned with morality and the nature of moral choices, I can't think of a single moment when it isn't obvious whether or not a character is doing the right thing.  There are no moral dilemmas whatever.  And a good thing too - thorny ethical issues would only turn it into an episode of `Star Trek'.  If you think a film needs to be confused about right and wrong in order to be interesting, watch `Quiz Show' and realise your error.Here's most of the ethics in a nutshell: the star contestants of a popular quiz show are cheating, with the connivance of the producers, the sponsor, and the network.  That they shouldn't be cheating is never in dispute.  The interesting questions are:  Why are they cheating?  and, What is it like for them, and how do they maintain dignity, when they're found out?  Of course, in an intelligent character study like this there are plenty of other questions.  I won't ruin your pleasure by giving away any of the answers. The best scenes, probably, are the ones in which a character must admit to someone or some group of people that he has cheated.  All these scenes are very good and each is handled in a different way.  But they're just cherries in a rich fruitcake.  `Quiz Show' is one of my personal favourites.  It was nominated for Best Picture of 1994 - an unusually fertile year - although the award went instead to some big dumb propaganda piece.",10,49,65,17 October 1999
"Girl, Interrupted"," Hard not to be won over
","Maybe it's time for me to take another look at 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' - I don't remember it being particularly good, certainly not as good as this.  Forman may be a better director than Mangold, but there's little evidence he can tell good material from bad.  (Sometimes he stumbles across good material by accident, and the result is an 'Amadeus'.)  'Girl, Interrupted' is a film that actually cares about making US care about the inmates.  I found myself growing very fond of Susanna and Lisa despite taking an intense initial dislike to both - how much more agreeable the company of the mad but intelligent is to that of the sane but stupid, I found myself thinking - and in no time at all I was hooked, and moved.  And unless my memory plays me false this is also a SMARTER film than 'Cuckoo', as well as being a more touching one.Okay, Mangold does have his weaknesses.  Anyone who has to resort to a song montage might as well hold up a title card saying 'I don't know how to portray the passage of time'; the last fifteen minutes appears to consist of five consecutive endings (Forman ended HIS film cleanly, I'll give him that); and while we may have needed Susanna's first-person narration to lead us into the story, we certainly didn't need it to lead us out.  It's easy to forgive all of this.  Besides, Mangold has positive virtues to compensate: he knows how to pace, and, as I said before, he knows how to make us love the characters.I should mention few incidental pleasures.  One of them, surprisingly, is Whoopi Goldberg.  Who would have thought it, but she actually portrays a character that isn't her usual arch, smug one, in a role in which it would have been easy to lapse into arch smugness - and she does it well.  Also, you'll have to admit, 'Girl, Interrupted' is a great title.  How could anyone NOT bear good will to a film with a title like that?  Moreover, 'Downtown' is a great song; I don't care who knows I think so.",8,0,0,3 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," The only film in history worth seeing for the special effects alone
","... And it ALSO has an intelligent script.  Conventional wisdom has it that no film needs both at once.The special effects have never been surpassed.  Remember this: unlike their digital counterparts, those gracefully sliding model spaceships look better, the bigger the screen.  I gather that Kubrick was still holding out against the digital tide at the very end of his life, insisting on animatronics rather than animation in his unfilmed `AI'.  Good for him.There IS one flaw - or at least, it appears to be a flaw at first.  It's the lighting.  The parts of the spacecraft in shadow ought to have been all but pitch black, since they are never exposed to anything stronger than Earthlight, and sometimes not even that.  Instead the shadows are the pale blue ones we'd expect to see at mid-afternoon on Earth.  Kubrick surely knew this was a mistake.  I suspect he simply wanted a very bright sunlit look that inky shadows precluded: and since we certainly feel the how pitilessly harsh and pure sunlight is in outer space, he probably made the right decision.What else can Kubrick do, apart from design the world's best special effects?  He's one of the few people who can use classical music in the score without making a fool of himself; and the only one, so far as I can tell, who can use Ligeti in the score at all.  He can deliver moments of pure dispassionate terror.  Most important of all in this kind of epic, he can make us feel that we're watching history itself.  I admit you may find it next to impossible to work out what happens at the end.  Not that it matters.  I gather it can be done: and you can always cheat and look up the answer in Arthur C. Clarke's book.  You'll probably be glad Kubrick was so elliptical.Did I mention the importance of a big screen?  Well, I'll mention it again. Travel to another city, if you have to, in order to see `2001' in a cinema.",10,2,4,7 November 1999
Toy Story," Decent enough but no milestone
","Think of momentous years in Hollywood's history like 1927 (the year of the first talkie), 1932 (the first use of three-colour technicolor), 1935 (the first feature in full colour), and 1937 (the first animated feature).  I kept telling myself, in 1995, that I was witnessing something equally ground-breaking and historically important.  And who knows, maybe I was. The four historic films I alluded to above were `The Jazz Singer', `Flowers and Trees', `Becky Sharp' and `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', only the last of which has any claim to being a classic.  `Toy Story' has no great claim, either.  In retrospect it was nothing new, just another instance of Hollywood's current infatuation with computer-generated images: pleasant, light and unremarkable.Computer animation is really a soulless device and, although I found it enjoyable, this is a soulless movie.  To begin with the animation wasn't quite ripe.  Toys, I suppose, are easy to animate: but when the flesh-and-blood children start to look as if they're also made of plastic, when the whole world seems to be made of plastic, the eye longs in vain for something else.Perhaps including children at all was a mistake.  A Hans Andersen toy story, a story that concerned toys and only toys, would have been more fun (and more moving).  The film betrays itself when it starts to think of the children.  The two central characters, after all, are BAD toys - horribly gimmicky devices that children very sensibly lose interest in after not so sensibly getting their parents to buy them some other worthless gimcrack. When Woody gave his speech about how important they really were in servicing a child's dreams and wishes and whatnot ... did anyone really fall for it? It would have been much more honest if he'd said, every toy for himself, kids be damned.I'm sorry if I sound overly critical - as I said, I liked it, so for me at least the slightly sour taste wasn't strong enough to ruin the film.  John Lasseter deserves credit for taking a formulaic buddy tale and breathing genuine life into it.  (All the more credit with a medium as unyielding as computer animation.)  `Toy Story' is pleasant and fun.  But frankly, every single traditionally animated film Disney has made from 1989 on, with the possible exception of `The Hunchback of Notre Dame', is better.  And - sorry to close with a carp - did Randy Newman really have to break into song so often?  Wasn't it enough for him to write the score, without croaking his songs out over it?",7,3,13,25 September 1999
Singin' in the Rain," It's the vitality of its parts, as well as of the whole, that does it
","That 'Singin' in the Rain' is a great film you can learn from more erudite and closely argued reviews than mine (and from more enthusiastic reviews, too, although I love the film as much as anyone and could be just as enthusiastic if I chose).I'd just like to mention one thing: the films within the film. Donen and Kelly deserve especial credit for not slacking off here. The swashbuckling silent picture that introduces us to Lockwood and Lamont actually comes across as a well-made crowd-pleaser (it is admittedly more compressed than a real film of the era would have been, but we can forgive the compression), and since Gene Kelly isn't afraid to give Lockwood his own charm, energy and physical skill, it's no strain at all to believe that he's a popular actor, or that the film could be a box-office success. (I wouldn't mind seeing it myself.) And the first and last sound Lockwood-and-Lamont vehicle is equally persuasive (in its earlier incarnation as a dire piece of petrified staginess AND later, when it's a perfectly decent early stab at a screen musical).Kelly claims that the 'Broadway Melody' section grew and grew from a tiny diversion to a huge, long, lavish diversion; and this, too, tells us something: that side references of this kind, to projects which the various characters happen to be or have been working on, have a life of their own, which means that the projects themselves have a life of their own. This is a GOOD thing. The musical numbers that are part of the story fit the story perfectly well, and as everyone knows the title song could not be a more natural or apt expression of Lockwood's feelings than it is in context. The musical numbers that are NOT part of the story are bound by no such rules of integration. Nor should they be.The final film-within-the-film  Lockwood and Selden's first project together, the film they're looking at a billboard advertisement for in the final shot  is also entitled 'Singin' in the Rain'. Some people think that the film they make is more or less the film we see. But of course it isn't. 'Singin' in the Rain'  neither the film we see, nor any film that Lockwood and Selden would have made together  is not some exercise in twee, unimaginative, academic self-reference. These people have talent. It's clear from the other samples of their craft that they're capable of CREATING stuff (in fact, they could scarcely prevent themselves from doing so), and they don't need to bottle their own autobiographies and pass it off as art. If you want some clue as to what the film-within-a-film version of 'Singin' in the Rain' is like, look to the opening credits, in which we see Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds singing in the rain together. I believe that this is a conceptual sketch (just as the version of 'Broadway Melody' we see is a conceptual sketch) of the musical number as it will appear in Lockwood and Selden's film. It's clear the film they make is something entirely removed from the story of how they came to make it.",10,4,7,26 November 2002
Toy Story 2," Computer animation finally comes of age
","All I can say is, the Hollywood convention for naming sequels is unfortunate.  You don't see so many numerals in literature.  What would have happened if `The Lord of the Rings' had been called `The Hobbit 2'?  No-one would have taken it seriously.  If only someone could have found an alternate name for `Toy Story 2', I wouldn't have such a hard time convincing people that it's the second film that's the real triumph - the delightful masterpiece `Toy Story' was trying to be.It's funnier; the animation - well, the art direction, anyway - is better, less concerned with ersatz photo-realism; the musical score is immeasurably more stirring; and the songs actually fit.  Most importantly, the rules of the Toy Story universe are clearly described - and adhered to.  It's an ironclad rule that a toy NEVER moves while being observed by a human.  In the original, as you'll recall, one of the main obstacles is overcome by breaking this rule - which trivialises the whole story, since there are a hundred occasions in both movies where it would be useful for the toys to be able to move while being watched.  To see the sequel is to see things done RIGHT.Furthermore, `Toy Story 2' obeys another golden rule the first film breaks: NEVER deliver a sentimental moral when (a) the sentiment is hard to take seriously, and (b) the success of the story depends upon it being taken seriously.  The original is all about how important toys are to children. In the case of Woody and Buzz, I'm sceptical about this; and in any event, who cares, since it's the toys, not the children, who are the main characters.  The sequel is all about how important children are to toys. That's why the sequel is so much richer.Yet I feel safe in recommending the film to everyone who loved the first `Toy Story', since I'm sure everything lovable about the first is still there.  Buzz and Woody are much the same (but somehow deeper).  And the three-eyed alien dolls are back - with more screen time!Maybe it's a mistake to even think about the original, though, because the sequel is magnificent not by comparison, nor by association - it's simply magnificent.  I'll content myself with mentioning just one more thing: the `bloopers' we see over the end credits.  (I gather `A Bug's Life' did the same thing; but since `Toy Story 2' is almost certainly the superior film, this is of no moment.)  A number of live-action movies have adopted the loathesome practise of showing out-takes and discarded footage over the end credits.  It's good to see it so cuttingly satirised.",9,4,6,3 December 1999
Chariots of Fire," Personally, I'm on the side of the aristocrats.
","A young English runner is reviled by The Establishment because he hires a professional trainer.  The Establishment feels that this is setting a dangerous precedent.  Too many more concessions like this, they think, and the amateur spirit will be lost.They're absolutely right.  Look at the Olympics nowadays: a hive of corruption and even the ping pong players are in it for the money. Moreover the athletes - ESPECIALLY in sports like running - have been trained to the eyeballs to the point where they become specialised machines who consult both coach and sponsor before deciding what shoes to wear.  Good on the aristocrats who used to run the games.  If only they'd held out longer.Perhaps I'm straying a little from the point.  I suppose the point is this. When you see a group of runners lined up at the start of a race, the positions is symmetrical.  A win for one is a loss for everyone else. Exactly one person will win, whatever happens - so why should we want one person in particular to win?  We need some fact to break the symmetry: this athlete has overcome overwhelming odds; that athlete is the only one who isn't cheating; this other athlete is such a nice chap.  So what are we given in 'Chariots of Fire'?  An athlete who is trying to steal a march on his competitors by starting a training arms race, and another athlete who has changed events because he has a superstition about the day of the week on which he's been scheduled.  I tempts me to root for one of the unknowns.This doesn't matter if the film is well enough staged.  And sure enough, people tell me it's been filmed in such an inspiring way.  Maybe they're right.  I don't see it myself.  I know I've seen races that have made my pulse quicken much more - quite apart from the fact that I was offered little reason to want the two stars to win, in the first place.",7,10,17,23 July 1999
Life Is Beautiful," 'Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.' (Oscar Wilde, preface to 'The Picture of Dorian Gray')
","This film is a beautiful thing.Okay, perhaps that's cheating.  I don't really like responding to people who carp at 'Life is Beautiful', mainly because I don't see how they could fail to have the required reactions.  How could anyone not find Guido charming? Yes, he's a pathological confabulator, but that's the point.  This is the story of someone whose way of life consists of enchanting the world around him with white lies (most of them are white) and manipulative genius.  He tries to continue living in the same way as the civilised world around him collapses; arguably, he succeeds, but he ends up paying a heavy price.  How could anyone not like this fable?And how could anyone not find both halves of the film - particularly the first, of course - funny?  It's the kind of humour where it doesn't matter if you laugh or not; either way, you can still enjoy the wit, and marvel at Guido's folkloric cleverness.  And on subsequent viewings it becomes more and more clear how the two halves set each other off perfectly.  Toccata and fugue. ...I understand the viewpoint of those who think that Benigni shouldn't have made a comedy about the Holocaust.  I can see how Holocaust survivors (and perhaps those close to them) might be genuinely offended.  But this doesn't make 'Life is Beautiful' a bad film; it simply means, at most, that making it was an impolitic act.  I've heard interviews with Holocaust survivors who thought 'Schindler's List' was a similarly impolitic act.  (And note that 'Schindler's List', however good it may be, is clearly inferior as a work of art.)  If anything is wrong, it's the act of using the Holocaust as part of the subject matter of ANY work of art.  Benigni's particular way of handling the subject is as good as any other, provided he succeeds, which he does.",10,3,6,30 January 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Deserves to be an icon
","This is the one moment in Kubrick's career when he overdid the `found' music thing.  He makes the most liberal use of Beethoven, Elgar, Purcell, Rossini, Dvorak, Rimsky-Korsakov ... have I left anyone out?  -although I must say that his use of music is often as cunning as ever: at its first appearance the use of Rimsky-Korsakov's `Scheherezade' struck me as being a cheap device, but it turned out a moment later to offer a sly remark on Alex's fantasy.  But `Pomp and Circumstance'?  Too obvious.That's my quibble out of the way.  When I saw it `A Clockwork Orange' did everything to justify its reputation as a masterpiece, although, curiously, very little to justify its reputation as a sick excursion into the old ultra-violence.  In fact it struck me as the product of a more civilised age.  (Whether or not it WAS the product of a more civilised age, I wouldn't know: I wasn't alive back then.)  Note how we are asked, as if it's no big deal, to feel sorry for Alex.  After committing terrible crimes he is altered so as to be physically incapable of committing any more, but this isn't enough for the people whom Alex has wronged.  They want to see him suffer.  Not to any particular end; they simply want suffering for its own sake.  I wonder how many people these days would notice that there's anything wrong with this.  We're starting to think, once again, that the purpose of the criminal courts is to exact revenge - just look at all the `vitcim's rights' activists about.Not that Kubrick's film has a message to offer them, or anyone else.  In many scenes every character present has a point and nobody is exactly right. Look at the scene where Alex is being paraded before the press as a triumph of the Ludivico technique, and the priest objects that all that has happened is that Alex has been robbed of his free will (just as he was when he was locked up).  The priest is almost right, just as the minister is almost right when he responds that hit doesn't matter, so long as the crime rate drops; but you'll notice that the reason the priest advances is a silly one: that Alex is behaving himself now only in response to a crude system of reward and punishment.  The claim that Alex has no power to make decisions, and the claim that he acts out of a fear of immediate punishment, can't BOTH be right; besides, the irony invisible to the priest, but obvious to us, is that his own fire-and-brimstone preaching is no more than an earlier version of the Ludivico technique, with this difference - it doesn't work.  Still, although we think little of the priest, and although he's wrong, we know he's on to something.  So is the prison guard whose reactions we see throughout the scene.  He doesn't take to the new technology at first, but when he sees that Alex is subject to fits of naseau - when he sees that his native cruelty will be indulged after all - he's all for it.No doubt about it - a film of marvellous complexity, and, two or three shocks of violence aside, it's a delight to watch.",10,2,4,16 April 2000
The Legend of 1900," This is a film I wish everyone would see -
","<ul><li>the more people see it, the more people there are to help me work out what to make of it.  It's hard not to like, and the central conceit, the fantasy story of someone whose entire life is spent crossing and re-crossing the Atlantic, is just delicious - yet there's always something that prevents it from working as it should.  There's too much narration.  Narration aside, there are too many words.  Just before 1900 and the narrator part ways the former explains himself, to some degree, in a longish speech.  The speech was necessary: we needed to hear his reasons from his own lips.  But once it had been given the scene should have ended.  Instead the two characters keep adding postscripts as they walk away from one another - and they're standard, maudlin things which are at odds with what 1900 had been saying a moment ago.  Again and again, there are words where there shouldn't be.</li></ul>But then, it may be that the title character was given too FEW words - at least at first.  Because it's so long before we first hear 1900 express his thoughts verbally (and because in the absence of other information about his character we are unwilling to pass judgment on him until he does) it takes too long for us to warm to him.  In fact we never warm to him as much as we should.And yet there are scenes - the piano duel, the girl in the rain - that are just fantastic, that make me reluctant to criticise anything at all.  Any film containing moments like those can afford to lose its way at times.P.S.  Of course, a film about a pianist born on the first day of the Twentieth Century ought to be called 'The Legend of 1901', which if you asks me sounds better anyway.",8,39,58,4 November 2001
From Hell," Now where have I seen this kind of thing before...
","I didn't know at the time that 'From Hell' is based on a comic book, but in retrospect, it's obvious.  It's imbued throughout with what I call 'comicbook darkness'.You know the kind of thing I mean.  Whenever you pick up a modern comic book (which, admittedly, isn't often in my case) it turns out to have been written by someone obsessed with trying to capture the same rich characterisations one encounters in literature and cinema.  But rich characters are only possible in literature because of such things as internal monologues, and because the author is free to simply TELL us - taking as much time about it as he needs to - whatever it is he wants us to know.  Rich characters are possible in cinema because we get to see actual actors with actual human faces, and because directors have almost continuous control over the degree to which any given detail may be stressed.These devices aren't available to comic book artists, who, as it happens, CAN'T create rich characters, by ANY means.  It's just one of the limitations of their craft.  It's a limitation they share with oral storytellers, librettists, animators, composers and choreographers, so there's no reason whatever for them to be ashamed of it - but for some reason, they ARE ashamed, and so while they continue to draw clear, flat, action characters, they make a ghastly attempt to ape Dostoyevsky by having these characters brood all the time.  In an attempt to create 'depth' they give their heroes artificial flaws and cover their world with artificial grime.That's what we have here.  The hero is addicted to opium not because he would be but because it's the kind of comicbook detail designed to let us know that the authors are being all adult and sophisticated.  Characters are cynical not because it's in their nature but because it's not - because when a character acts or speaks against his or her nature, it is (so the theory goes) 'layered'.  I'll admit I'm having a hard time coming up with instances.  You've either noticed the kind of phoney, unearned darkness of modern comic books, or you haven't.  If you've noticed it you'll find the film is saturated with it.  But it's in the spirit in which the story is told rather than in any particular detail.No complaints about the plot, and in the final half hour or so, it actually starts to work as a film.  The trouble is it hadn't done so AT ALL until then.",Null,1,2,3 July 2002
Groundhog Day," Some answers (maybe)
","Spoilers follow.Two questions might trouble the curious: (1) Why is Phil trapped in Groundhog Day in the first place, and (2) Why (or how) does he eventually escape? We're never told, and rightly so. The answer to the first question cannot possibly matter, unless perhaps it's part of an answer to the second; but while watching the film for the first time the second question, in the form of 'What can Phil do in order to escape?', preoccupied me, and I thought he was on the right track several times: when he kidnapped and killed the groundhog, when he persuaded Rita to stay with him for the crucial hour, when he tried to save the life of the old tramp (who might, for all I knew, have been Father Time).I think there IS an answer, to both questions, and it is this: Phil is trapped on the 2nd of February FOR NO REASON WHATEVER, and consequently there is no reason whatever for his escape. But let me consider the competing theories first.(1) Phil is reliving the same day again and again until he gets it right. If this is so he may very well have to repeat February 3 a few times, too.(2) Phil is trapped in order to become a better person, and so he is released when he has 'made up for lost time' and done with Groundhog Day precisely as much as he ought to have done with the previous portion of his life.(3) Phil is reliving the same day until he exhausts all the possibilities, either of the day itself or of the position he is in.  This third hypothesis is a good description of what the film itself is doing - which is why it's such a great film. The FILM does what it can to exhaust the possibilities before it ends, and we feel that it has done so. Of course, it hasn't - it can't have - but perhaps Phil, in the many moments when we weren't looking, has.(4) The same cruel demon which imprisoned Phil in a town he loathes on a day he loathes, sets him free just when he has made a permanent peace with the situation.I like all of these theories, and I will not insist upon mine. (If mine is right, though, two things follow which feel right to me: there was no need for Phil to have escaped at all, and the fact that he ends up with the not-particularly-interesting-or-lovable Rita in his arms was pure accident... even if he lives the rest of his life as though it wasn't.) Why is this a great movie? Not because, in the end, it fails to tell us which of the five main competing possibilities is right, but because it so artlessly (and humourously) suggests all five at once.",10,9,17,23 September 2002
The Red Violin," The curious power of violins
","It's amazing how easy it is to care for musical instruments.  It's not giving much away to say that the red violin is imperilled more than once; and I was sitting in my seat, mentally screaming to the director: 'Kill off some of the characters if you want, maim and injure them, but for God's sake, don't hurt the violin!'  I don't think I could stand to watch even an ordinary violin damaged.  As for a surpassingly beautiful and sonorous violin, centuries old and perhaps with centuries yet to live ... well, it's no stretch at all to say that such an instrument would be more important than most of us, certainly more important than I.  So why shouldn't it be a central character?  Fictional characters simply have to (a) have things happen to them, and (b) make us care what happens to them.  They needn't do anything else.This is an amazing film.  The violin 'comes to life', so to speak, in five different eras (and countries), and every one of them is perfectly realised - it's a joy just to watch the temporal scenery.  (Perhaps the third of the five eras, early Edwardian England, is a little harder to swallow than the rest, with its aristocratic violinist who extemporises great music while having sex.  Really!  As if the resulting compositions would have the slightest value.)  It's interesting that the evocation of time and place is NOT accomplished by musical means.  Almost all the music we hear was composed by John Corigliano, and he makes his music as hard to pin down to any one age as he can.  This was an excellent idea.  It gives the violin a character, and makes it seem more powerful than any of the forces temporarily besetting it.  It also suits the story in a way I'm not at liberty to reveal.Although it's easy to be absorbed in 'The Red Violin', be warned that the human interest in each of the five eras is subservient to the violin interest.  If you are one of those people who can't easily care about a musical instrument much of the film will be lost on you.",10,1,1,21 June 2000
Shine," 'Good God, man! You can't let him play Rachmaninov's Third! He'll be killed! KILLED, I tell you! No-one has ever ...' etc.
","Tortured genius, domineering father, piano music, blah, blah, et cetera. 'Shine' may be a good movie, but its best friends couldn't call it special.The script isn't at all strong and Hicks tries to make up the deficit with creative presentation of one kind or another.  David is obsessed - at any rate, the film is obsessed, it's not clear to what extent David is - with Rachmaninov's third piano concerto (implausibly referred to as the 'Rach 3'), the first movement in particular.  We never quite hear this movement. We hear in the background on an old gramophone (throbbing dotted notes in the bass entirely inaudible); its themes are woven into the film's score; and in the big climactic scene where David plays it in public for the first time, sound effects are distorted so that we hear almost everything EXCEPT Rachmaninov's music as it really is.  And clearly a lot of work went into arranging the shots in that climactic scene.  The result is a much more creatively presented 'moment of truth' than is usual in this kind of film.If the presentation isn't threadbare clichÃ©, though, much of the content is. 'Shine' does all the standard scenes very well - moments of triumph here, moments of despair there - but lacks an overall story that might make some sense of them.  (This is particularly odd given that Scott Hicks felt not at all concerned with sticking to the facts of Helfgott's life, or even getting it vaguely right.)  In the end it feels like an exceptionally well made nothing very much.  Watch it for the performances - those of Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush in particular.",6,4,8,11 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Compared to '2001' ...
","I was reminded of '2001: A Space Odyssey' in a number of ways.  Both it and 'Eyes Wide Shut' are indescribably, wallowingly, gloriously slow.  But whereas '2001' made an immediate impact, and all but clubbed me over the head while I was watching it, I felt as if 'Eyes Wide Shut' gently tapped me on the shoulder - and THEN clubbed me on the head, an hour or two after I left the cinema.  Maybe it's the movie, maybe my reflexes have decayed. Whatever: my opinion of the movie has been steadily rising since I finished watching it.I'm going to run with the comparison for a bit.  In both films it's ambiguous - or it appears to be ambiguous at first - exactly what happens. But whereas '2001' has a 'what the hell just happened?' kind of ambiguity, there are exactly two obvious ways of interpreting what happened in 'Eyes Wide Shut', one of which, I think, is determinately right, and the other wrong.  It all hinges on how seriously you take the title, 'Eyes Wide Shut'. (There.  Let anyone who hasn't seen the movie try to get some meaning out of THAT.)Both films have a key moment of terror.  The moment in '2001' occurs when something goes alarmingly wrong way out beyond the orbit of Mars.  The feel of 'Eyes Wide Shut', the sense we get that the central character is miles away from society and beyond all help, is quite similar.  Somehow the terror is much greater in '2001'.  But terror gives way to something else in '2001', whereas here Kubrick manages to keep up the quiet fear in subsequent, seemingly innocent, scenes.In both films Kubrick's use of music is something else again to that of people who plaster bits of Sibelius or Beethoven or Puccini or whoever over scenes in their films because they think it sounds good.  'Eyes Wide Shut' made me hum Shostakovich to myself on the way home, but that's not what I mean.  More importantly I get the impression that Kubrick has looked at every piece of music ever written and chosen exactly the right one to fit in with his story, whatever musical territory he had to explore in order to get it.  (Normally I wouldn't listen to Ligeti in a pink fit - but try to imagine '2001' or 'Eyes Wide Shut' without him.)I do side with those people who describe the opening scenes as too slow. Sort of, anyway.  Kubrick is merely adopting the pace - surely it's the right pace - he will stick to throughout; so it's not sloth that's the problem.  Rather, we're not being fed enough of immediate interest in 'Eyes Wide Shut' (this is in stark contrast to '2001') to get us through the scenes the first time round.  I think this IS a defect.  (Of a sort.)I can understand that there are people who dislike 'Eyes Wide Shut', but it's futile to deny that it's very good.  We haven't been given very many Kubrick films since about 1960, and this is the last.  If you miss this one you'll probably regret it.",10,0,2,11 August 1999
Titanic," A North Atlantic carp
","First of all, `Titanic' was, on the whole and all things considered, a good movie.  There have been much sillier Best Picture awards handed out over the years.  I'll go through the basic drill as quickly as possible ...  Yes, the Titanic was HUGE - Titanic, as they say - and astounding to watch; yes, the musical score was intolerable, synthesised, neo-Celtic syrup; yes, Kate Winslet was gorgeous and, at one point, naked; yes, the story was pleasant, but pretty thin for three hours.  Have I covered everything?  Probably not, but I want to move on to complain about the very end.  The final few minutes contain footage that is just so manifestly stupid, so completely unnecessary, so obviously witless, that even if it's not enough to ruin the movie, James Cameron ought never be allowed to hear the end of it.  The trouble is that I can't lodge my complaint without giving some stuff away. So I feel obliged to issue aWARNINGto those people, wherever they may be, who have not yet seen `Titanic' - which I hope they will ignore.  Go on.  Have a peek.  It can't REALLY hurt you to know what you're in for.  It's not me, but James Cameron, who wants to lull you into quiescence for three hours and then hit you over the head with a big stupid mackerel.  -That said, I'll issue aSECOND WARNINGbefore getting down to business.My complaint is in two parts:(1)  A good deal of interest was supplied as we watched the diamond change hands throughout the movie, wondering where it would end up when the ship finally sank.  Well, it ends up - this is your last chance to stop reading - in Rose's hands.  She keeps it.  In fact she has it on her person seventy-something years later when she heads out into the Atlantic to meet the salvagers.  Then she wanders out to the railing one night and tosses it into the ocean.  WHY toss it into the ocean?  If she doesn't need the money, then the poor sods who invested heavily in order to find the diamond probably do - why not give THEM the diamond?  And what RIGHT does she have to effectively destroy this historical heirloom, former property of Louis XIV?  Clearly Cameron thought that, having made such heavy weather of the diamond early on, he needed to do something with it at the end, and he thought that throwing it into the sea would be very fine and dramatic. Dramatic fiddlesticks.(2)  Rose finally dies at a ripe old age and goes to a kind of heavenly Titanic where she is re-united with her true love, Jack.  But hang on. She's been married for several DECADES to some other bloke, who presumably has SOME claim on her affections in the afterlife.  I bet there'll be an awkward moment on the HMS Celestial Titanic when HE shows up.  But over-glorifying her (no doubt genuine) love for Jack is the least of it. Why the sudden dive into the supernatural?  One minute, we're in the material universe with the rest of the human race; the next, we're up in the sky somewhere.  I'm surprised they didn't give us a shot of Cal Hockley stoking the boilers in Hell.  (I've heard some people run the defence that this is all just a dream.  This strikes me as a strained interpretation; and even if it's the right interpretation, it's a poor defence.  Dreams are dramatically irrelevant.  At least, this one is.)These two complaints aren't trivial: they're illustrative of a more general problem.  The wondrous spectacle of `Titanic' is more than twice undercut by Cameron's facile theatrics.  Still - big ship, adolescent love, Kate Winslet, lots of water, and all that.",7,1,2,6 September 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The kind of film you get when standards are exacting but not high
","What a lifeless film.  It's not exactly that Chris Columbus is too faithful to the book - although he fails to make changes that ought to have been made, like removing (or better still, drastically altering) that end-of-term dinner scene at the end, with its vulgar celebration of cheap success -; rather, he transfers material from page to screen with no clear idea of why he's doing so.  The entire film comes across as a cut-and-paste job.I did wonder, at first, if the lack of screen tension was due to the fact that I'd read the book.  (Everyone else I know who read the book and then saw the film wondered the same thing.)  But I'm reasonably sure that reading the book has nothing to do with it.  Lifelessness, the 'cut-and-paste' feeling, needless detail presented flatly rather than alluded to artfully - these are things intrinsic to the film; we'd notice them even if the books had never been written.  The only difference is that if the book hadn't been written it would be more of a mystery WHY the film was at once mildly entertaining and flat.  As it is, we know.  The director wanted to transfer (and 'transfer' is the right word) as much as possible of the book to the screen because (a) he had no clear idea WHY he was transferring any of it, (b) the world's most powerful author and the world's largest media company were either breathing down his neck, or in a position to start breathing down his neck if they wanted to, and (c) the film would be harshly judged by a huge fan base consisting in large part of children - who are the worst possible judges of literary adaptions.(I know this is beside the point, but what IS the deal with the Potter books?  I mean, I enjoy them, and I'll eagerly read the next, but surely it's obvious that they can't hold a candle to other fantasy works which children can or used to be able to appreciate: Lewis's Narnia books, Tolkein's 'The Hobbit', Ende's 'The Neverending Story' and 'Momo' ... and others too, I'm sure.  Only by knowing little about fantasy is it possibly to feel strongly about Rowling either way.)Mind you, I'm not letting Columbus off the hook.  He really is an execrable director.  ALL his films fall flat; it says a lot that 'Mrs. Doubtfire' is easily the best of them.  And he has the unique ability to draw weak, dramatically ineffective scores from composer John Williams ('Home Alone', 'Home Alone 2', 'Stepmom').  This time, in this regard, he failed.  Williams has written one of his lesser scores, but it's still enchanting - well, to some degree -; it's one of the things that keep the film more or less chugging along.  Then there's the fact that, to be fair, Rowling's world DOES have its pleasing aspects; and also Alan Rickman's performance as Snape, and the LOOK in certain places - the colours captured under overcast English skies are rich and gorgeous.  The subtler computer effects (used to create, say, the animated photographs) demonstrate all that's good about modern effects technology.  The computer-GENERATED image, on the other hand (like the astroturf-green quidditch arena, or the cutesy three-headed dog, or the wall leading into Diagon Alley), demonstrate all that's bad.  They're as lousy as any similar effects anywhere else.",Null,0,2,13 December 2001
The Untouchables," Full of itself
","Brian De Palma indulges in his usual forced artiness.  He wants to show us Al Capone at the opera; so he casts around for the least obvious camera angle and places us within side-spittle-reach of the lead tenor, giving us a shot of Capone through his lips (although our ears tell us that the tenor is across the hall).  Yes, very pretty.  Very clever.  Bah.  Then there's a climactic confrontation at a rail station; so De Palma decides to present every excruciating second of it in treacle-speed slow motion, half of the time hanging from the ceiling.  Bah.Note to De Palma: it IS possible to be considered a great director, if that's what you're worried about, without all this gimmickry.  Really, it is!I give up.  I can't see the point of any of it.  I guess it's a film for people who like to feel tough.  The gangsters are tough; the people who fight the gangsters are tough; Robert De Niro gets to do his tough schtick, so that we may all feel tough.  Bah.",5,2,8,22 August 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," Brilliant but hamstrung
","There are only two things wrong with 'It's a Wonderful Life' - unfortunately, they are the beginning and the ending.  (I don't reveal what happens at the end, but I do reveal something about the feel of the ending, and those who wish to come to the film cold may wish to read no further.)To begin with the beginning ...  This is the story of a man's life AND of the way the town would have been had he never existed; but the device whereby we are shown that counterfactual is the most ham-fisted and grating one Capra could have chosen.  It involves a bumbling angel named Clarence who has yet to get his wings (and, if I were in charge of Heaven, never would).  Heaven (or perhaps God - it's hard to tell) appears to be the Crab Nebula and it flashes whenever it utters an accented syllable.  Clarence is a half-witted interstellar firefly.  I'm not making fun of the special effects: I'm questioning the fact that the deus ex machina had to be made into a character at all, let alone such an annoying one.But the ending is worse.  It's clearly MEANT to be a happy ending: the trouble is that it's no continuation whatever of the preceding story. Difficulties are vanquished by being ignored.  It's as if Capra visualised the scene he wanted at the end, and when he discovered it didn't fit, filmed it anyway.  A genuinely happy ending would have been great - even a tragic ending would have been less painful, and depressing, to watch.Now for the good news.  Between the faltering beginning and the sour conclusion it's sustained magic - one brilliant scene after another, to the point where it's difficult to believe that so many good bits found their way into the same film.  And I don't just mean that individual scenes play well, but to no purpose: there really is a fine and complex story supporting them. The ending is a genuine shame, but if you can get past it, good luck to you.",9,3,7,3 August 1999
Enemy at the Gates," Uh, guys, there's a war on
","No doubt the title is an indication of what the film would LIKE to be about. The Germans forces were indeed 'at the gates' - they are on the verge of capturing Stalingrad, they would lay siege to Leningrad, and at one point even Moscow appeared to be in danger.  The situation was desperate.  But after we're told all this, the position of the German army turns out to have no more to do with the story than the position of the sun in the zodiac. After a bitter, violent battle over - well, we're never told - nothing of a military nature happens again.  Not even offstage.  (Until the end, when, after a brief 'offensive' of unfathomable significance, an epilogue tells us that the Germans were repelled from after all.)  All the action in Stalingrad freezes so that we can watch a protracted duel between a Russian and a German sniper.Now I'm prepared to believe that snipers played a valuable role in this kind of warfare - I wouldn't know - but Vassili's primary value, we must assume in the absence of information to the contrary, is as propaganda - a means of keeping up the morale of the local troops.  But there's something circular here.  The snipers are the only people we see doing any actual fighting, and by the end of the film they seem to be devoting all their efforts to shooting a German sniper who is in turn doing nothing but trying to shoot Vassili.  What does ANY of this have to do with, you know, the invasion?The fact that the troops of a hostile foreign power are on Russian soil (they haven't yet been defeated, and it looks to be only a matter of time before even Moscow would be overrun) doesn't seem to motivate the characters to do much.  Nobody makes a single decision for the good of the war effort as a whole.  Danilov builds up the Vassili legend because of personal feelings and is ready to tear it down later for other personal reasons; Tania wants to kill Germans - kill them herself, by hand, rather than help her fellow soldiers as best she can by working in intelligence - because they killed her parents; Danilov tries to transfer her to a safer job not because that's where she should be (it's a mere coincidence that that IS where she should be), but because he's hitting on to her; Vassili's heart isn't in the duel with the German sniper until he has a casual acquaintance's death to avenge.  When Sacha's mother is told that her son is a traitor (now serving the forces who have bombed the city she grew up in to rubble), her only reaction is, 'Perhaps he'll be safer with them than with us.'  Wherever we look, we see dreary personal concerns.  Did any of these people notice that the enemy IS at the gates?If Anaud was trying to make his characters more plausible by making them pettier, he failed.  When Sacha tells a third party what we supposedly already know - that Tania is in love with Vassili - it came as news to me. I hadn't seen any insipient love anywhere.  I suppose I ought to have worked it out, by assuming that the single female character must be there to fall in love with someone and using a process of elimination to work out who it was (she plainly didn't care for one of the two candidates, therefore she must be head over heels with the other one), but really, even in a movie as dull as this, I have better things to do.",Null,1,1,31 May 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Ron Howard finally makes it
","Some spoilers follow.To judge from his previous films, Ron Howard doesn't like smart people much, doesn't trust intelligence as a trait and thinks little of thinking as an activity.  How did he come to present a sympathetic account of the career of a genius? However he did it, he did it; and for the first time in his career he's made a genuinely good film.On the surface this is ideal material for the old Ron Howard, the director of 'Parenthood' and 'Apollo 13' and 'EdTV' who longs for opportunities to sink the boot into intellectuals and urge his audience to be at least moderately stupid. Nash is mentally brilliant, yes, but that (according to a superficial analysis of what happens) is his very undoing: he suffers from schizophrenia, and is prone to both paranoid fantasies and vivid hallucinations. That's what comes of having a beautiful mind. Far better to have a dull, unattractive one. ...Only that's not what the film is saying. Nash finds away around his difficulties not because he agrees to be stupid, but because he's able to remain clever; he works out (by thinking about it) that certain of the people he sees do not in fact exist, and thinks of effective ways of ignoring them. And anyway, ARE the hallucinations and the paranoia merely manifestations of the very same mental states that allow Nash to have his mathematical insights? Not at all. Some of the other mathematicians we see are, say, half as clever as Nash, but they're not half as schizophrenic; indeed, so far as we can tell, they're not schizophrenic at all. We're also told that Nash's main problem was that his condition wasn't diagnosed until too late and that this was because he grew up and lived in an environment that ENCOURAGED paranoid delusions. If Nash had a genuinely mental failing it wasn't that he was too clever, but that in certain respects he wasn't clever enough - wasn't able to see through the flimsy Cold War propaganda which many of his contemporaries DID see through; but of course, these people were stupid in THEIR own way, as we all are.But whatever the precise message, it's a good film.  (Let's pretend that the epilogue in which Nash wins the Nobel Prize wasn't included, as it shouldn't have been; it's a glaring irrelevance on the face of a movie that otherwise clearly knows what it's about.) I particularly like the rug-pulling halfway through. We know immediately that the cloak-and-dagger spycraft story isn't real; the details are just too ridiculous, and the situation is just too obviously a response to Nash's unfulfilled desire to fight communism. But the obviousness of this illusion simply helps mask the subtlety of the other one: Nash's imaginary roommate. We ought to have suspected him, for a variety of reasons. But we didn't. At least, I didn't.I wish the movie hadn't dumbed down its characters' ideas so much, but it gets away with doing so because it concentrates its real attention elsewhere, and it does what it REALLY wants to do very well indeed.",8,0,2,20 August 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Obviously not a great fantasy film, but surprisingly, a good one
","This is undeniably a better film than the last one, which is odd, since it's also undeniable that the second book is the weakest in the series. But perhaps it's not so odd. The first book, after all, is at its best in the opening chapters, in which we, more or less along with Harry, discover that there's a whole world of wizards and witches, that Harry is both talented in magic and an inadvertant celebrity, etc. It was these opening chapters that Coloumbus most thoroughly muffed when he made the screen version. In the first book, nothing that happens at Hogwarts can live up to the promise of the opening; in the first film, the arrival at Hogwarts is a relief after all the dutiful but tedious exposition.Here, Columbus doesn't even bother trying to do that which he cannot do well in any case, brings Harry to Hogwarts by the shortest route possible, and plunges into the Hogwarts story - which is, it must be admitted, a far better story than the last one. Both films conclude with Harry and companions sneaking into a kind of underground 'chamber of secrets', but this quest has far less the nature of an arbitrary obstacle course; indeed, the last film had so much the nature of an arbitrary obstacle course that it might as well have been a game show.Pretty much everything is better the second time round. The creature effects are on average better (the basilisk actually WORKS), the art direction is better, the CGI is still a bit uneven but at its worst (i.e. on the Quidditch pitch) isn't quite so purely dreadful as it was last time, and John Williams's musical score is apter and more enchanting. (His music was the best thing in the film last time, and it is again, but this time it's richer and has been applied with a good deal more taste.) Kenneth Branagh makes a marvellous Gilderoy Lockhart. A pity he's under-utilised (as is everyone, to some degree); there's nobody else with comparable energy or charm in either film. Once again John Cleese has been dragged onto the set in order to appear on screen for a minute or so and to utter perhaps ten words in total.Columbus is still a pretty uninspired director, of course, and his dumbing down, his telling us everything twice and with words if possible so that even the slowest audience members get it, still earths the electricity we might otherwise have felt. (No doubt he dumbs down because he is making the film for children, but dumbing down for children has even less to be said for it than dumbing down for adults. If children fail to understand something, we can assume that they will grow smarter with age, and get it one day; whereas the adults too thick to get something are precisely those people who don't grow smarter with age and will never get it unless it IS dumbed down.) But all the same the direction is sharper and more assured than last time round. Columbus adheres less slavishly to the letter of Rowling's novel and the film is all the fresher for it. It's still true that more changes still should have been made. I wish Dobby had been written out of the script altogether, but given that he's there, I couldn't help longing for Columbus to summon up the courage to have him guillotined in the course of the film. I longed in vain.",Null,14,31,28 November 2002
Psycho," Please be careful
","Robert Louis Stevenson's masterful novella 'The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde' takes the form of a mystery: at the start we're told that Jekyll and Hyde share a secret, but it's a while before we find out what that secret is.  These days, almost everyone already knows what the secret is, and NOT because they've read the story - rather, they've listened to some blabbermouth, who, BECAUSE 'everyone already knows', feels himself licensed to spoil things for the few remaining people who don't.  Well, that blabbermouth won't be me.  And I'm not going to give away the surprises in 'Psycho', either.Nor should you, if you know what they are.  This is a plea for people to be more circumspect with such information, even if such circumspection seems futile in the current climate.P.S.  Psycho is a great movie - possibly Hitchock's best, although there are four other contenders for that title.  But this much everyone really DOES know already.P.P.S.:  And if you think Hitchcock couldn't possibly have missed with this material, take a look at Gus Van Sant's almost ludicrously incompetent scene-for-scene remake.",10,1,1,1 December 2001
Rosemary's Baby," Reassuring to fine it's every bit as good as its staunchest champions would have you believe
","Why aren't the horror directors of today as careful with their scripts as Polanski was?  Not that this is really horror.  Horror as we know it came into being with the slasher flicks of the late 1970s and early 1980s; 'Rosemary's Baby' is rather the kind of thing that the term 'dark fantasy' was coined to describe, by people of taste who noticed that the word 'horror' promised audiences something distinctly unpleasant and nasty.The film's construction is marvellous.  Things start slow - one beat, so to speak, to a bar - and gradually pick up speed so that by the end we are nervously tapping out semiquavers with our feet.  Polanski also understands the gentle art of hint-dropping.  Many events are filed away as tiny puzzles to be solved later, and they ARE solved later; others we don't attach any particular significance to at the time Polanski invites us to re-interpret in retrospect, AND chooses the right moment to let us do so.  And then, at the end, AFTER we've worked everything out, he presents us with a surprise - a delightful, gratuitous twist which nothing had prepared us for, which we couldn't have guessed, yet which doesn't cancel out the story as we'd understood it.  (Alas, many people know what this surprise is in advance. I, for one.  Yet this foreknowledge did nothing to spoil my enjoyment: a sure sign of superb construction.)All in all, a film that tempts you to rank it with the best ever made - which is more, but not much more, than it deserves - simply because it's perfect.  Everything went right.  Rosemary is a wonderfully sympathetic heroine, powerless without being passive, largely ignorant of what's going on around her without being at all stupid, and Mia Farrow makes you care deeply about her.  The cinematography is pellucid; the art direction is subtly right; there's also a fine, odd yet tuneful, musical score.  I can't believe I waited so long to see this.",10,178,218,21 April 2001
When Harry Met Sally...," When Harry Met Someone
","This is Billy Crystal's show.  He has an understated, ordinary, humble screen presence.  It's not the case that every single line HAS to be funny in order for us to like him - with Crystal, a joke can fall flat and somehow it doesn't make him personally look bad.  But here every line IS funny, so he has charm to burn.I know people like Meg Ryan - I guess I do, too, in this particular film - and I know that there are people who find her `orgasm' scene amusing, but Sally is really just someone for Harry to meet and ultimately fall in love with.  She's completely clueless.  Most of the jokes are at her expense rather than his.  The genuine wit, the power of observation, the theoretical insight, all lie with Harry.  Is this a problem?  Not in the least.  Unlike most romantic comedies this is not some kind of duel - it's the more realistic study of many, many separate encounters.Also unlike most romantic comedies, this one is funny.  I think I mentioned that.The film benefits from its second rank support: good performances by Carrie Fischer and that guy whose name doesn't matter, locations someone actually went to some trouble to look for, and a song-score that is doesn't intrude and hit us repeatedly over the head.  Allegedly `When Harry Met Sally' has been imitated by later productions, but I can't think of a case where the imitation is accurate enough to even be recognisable.",9,49,70,16 December 1999
Hercules," Pretty damned good - but there is this ONE problem ...
","The Ancient Greeks and Romans were twisting the Hercules legend out of shape long before Disney got hold of it.  So I'll skip the usual complaints about Hercules being Hera's son, there being a demon named `Panic' and so on.  I can understand people objecting on these grounds; I think such objections are often justified, but misguided in this particular case; but there are arguments on both sides I would need to present if I were to discuss the case here - and so I won't.  Let me just stipulate that fiddling around with classical mythology does not, in this case, matter.  If you disagree - well, you disagree.Alan Menken's music is hugely disappointing.  So is Musker and Clement's handling of it - they once showed a great flair for staging songs, but here they seem, for the most part, uncertain as to how to work the material in. (A notable exception is `One Last Hope'.)  On the plus side, animation has never been better.    Disney hasn't had a villain so well animated since 1967, possibly 1961.  (Look up the relevant villains, if you want.) Computer-rendering the hydra was I think a mistake, as computer rendering usually is, but that was a good scene, so I'll waive the objection.  -Oh, yes: I should also put in a word for the general look imparted by Gerald Scarfe.The story, really, was a strong one.  I have to say `really' because it's easy to come away with the impression that it was not, because of one tiny element: the big battle at the end.  Hercules defeated the bad guys with ludicrous ease in a weak and perfunctory scene - it lasts just seconds. This is a serious problem in the work of Musker and Clements.  If you look at `The Little Mermaid', `Aladdin' and `Hercules' you'll note that they all have a ridiculously large-scale set piece at the end which tends to prompt the reaction, `Yeah, yeah.'  They'll HAVE to do something about this.  For the story, was, as I say - look at it objectively and ignore the concluding battle - strong.  And AFTER the battle, when Hercules ...  Let's just say I found this smaller drama to be much more exciting, and certainly more creative.So it wasn't quite what it could have been.  Nonetheless I predict that `Hercules' will wear its years lightly; already, it is looking stronger, more muscular, and more likely to be immortal, than `Aladdin' ever did.",9,13,25,19 July 1999
Ice Age," Wonderful visuals ... and not bad in other respects, either
","I went to see this because I wanted a real cartoon - you know, the kind animated by pencil rather than keyboard - and it was the only plausible substitute available.  It's a far better substitute than I'd dared hope.The title says it all: it's an ice age.  We watch animals migrate away from the ice.  That's the point to the film; there is no other.  There IS, admittedly, also a story, and don't believe anyone who tells you it's not a good story; if there's a problem with it, it lies not with its inherent quality but with the fact that it feels at times like an intrusion - something which takes valuable time away from the character-based vignettes about odd-looking mammals travelling through the frozen landscape.  But not so much time that we have any grounds for being impatient.All the animals (the humans being a trivial exception) are animated well, simply but convincingly.  Essentially they're the three-dimensional counterparts of the Coyote and the Roadrunner, the various beasts developed by Jack Hannah in the inspired cartoons he directed at Disney ... and more recent animals, too, like the raccoon in 'Pocahontas' or the enchanted llama in 'The Emperor's New Groove'.  The computer animators have really learnt something from their pen-and-paper colleagues.  About time!  Or maybe this film was animated by people who USED to animate by hand but left what they took to be a sinking ship, in which case the gain comes at too high a price.'Ice Age' has the best art direction of the ten computer animated film ever released, better even than 'Monsters, Inc.'  At first I though it was just the ice, that the mere fact that everything HAD to be the colour of snow made it virtually impossible to duplicate the ugly, garish, cluttered mishmash of 'Shrek' (or 'Jimmy Neutron', a film I'm admittedly judging from the trailer - but doesn't it look like the ghastliest things ever made?). But this is uncharitable.  Many scenes take place on land on which snow has not yet fallen, and the art direction is STILL superb; everything MATCHES the snow, stylised in the same artful way.  And the creatures match the background.  It's not just that they're 'drawn' similarly; the main point is that they all look and move and are framed relative to other things as though they belong here.  Only three computer-animated features have art direction that's even worth mentioning (except perhaps to complain about): 'Toy Story 2', 'Monsters, Inc.' and now 'Ice Age'.  Each is visually better than the last.  'Ice Age' may not be as inspired overall - it's certainly not as deep - as the two Pixar movies, and perhaps some of the jokes in the first half fall flat.  'Monsters, Inc.' was a masterpiece; so (to take a recent example of something traditionally animated) was 'The Emperor's New Groove'.  'Ice Age' isn't.  But it's still the real deal; a good, sincere movie with something real to offer.  It's not a 'substitute' anything.",Null,0,0,29 March 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Ageless and all but perfect
","Of all war movies this is the one with the best idea behind it.  Think how easy it is to make a bad war movie.  A group of people must blow up a bridge, and this is the story of their quest ...  Actually, that DID serve as the premise for a film: it was called `Force Ten from Navarone', and it was dire.  Or how about this one: we see close up the brutalities of war. (Then we see them again.  Then we see some more of the brutalities of war. Then we see the credits.)  Or how about this: a humble American soldier, with the pragmatism native to his breed, rejects his superiors' highfalutin talk of honour and glory and asserts his basic humanity in trying to stay alive.  Or this one: we see English prisoners of war maintain their dignity in the face of Japanese brutality.They're all present, in a sort of a way: but ALSO present is a magnificent, long, suspenseful, tight story, around which these apparent clichés wrap naturally.  If the clichés don't wrap naturally then they, not the story, are bent out of shape.  Just when we think that the American pragmatist will turn out to be the hero, we see him cut a rather shabby figure, and it seems that there really WAS something to that highfalutin talk of honour and glory, after all.  But then we discover that he has standards of his own, and they appear to be better ones.  But THEN it seems that ...  I could go on indefinitely, since there are many people here with something to be said for them, and it requires some thought to see who has the most to be said for him in the end.There's almost no need to mention the excellent performances, photography and music.  The only thing one might have qualms about is historical accuracy.  Nothing like this ever happened.  Still, that makes the movie much less dishonest than those that base themselves on historical events, and then proceed to get them all wrong.  You can only be misled by `The Bridge on the River Kwai' if you don't know that it's pure fiction.  Well - you know now.",10,65,92,6 September 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Francis Ford Coppola's `Dracula' - Bram Stoker is not to blame
","There's no particular reason why a film should be faithful to its source; indeed, the best screen version of `Dracula', the John Badham version of 1979, is not based directly on the novel at all, but on the Edwardian stage play.  And a good thing too.  `Dracula', the novel, consists entirely of primary documents - diary entries, letters, newspaper reports, and the like - arranged in chronological sequence.  This kind of novel REQUIRES surgery when a script is being written.  But Coppola, possibly with an eye to his place in the history books, includes scenes, like the introductory ones in Dracula's castle, that only work in literary form.Apart from including a handful of previously unfilmed scenes - for no very good reason - Coppola's film is remarkably unfaithful to the book.  Yes, this is no sin in itself.  But if Coppola is so foolish as to call his film `Bram Stoker's Dracula' he can hardly complain when critics say, `Well, no, it isn't.'  What riles me is that every change is not only for the worse, but also completely witless.  There are scenes of warfare in the Middle Ages, adding a plot element so utterly at odds with the central story, and so completely out of nowhere, as to render the film ridiculous in the first few seconds.Indeed, Coppola has gone out of his way to make his film ridiculous.  (And yet somehow he seems to take it all so seriously.)  The sometimes-praised LOOK of the film is absurd: not natural, not nineteenth-century, not attractive, not anything.  Dracula has a blob-black shadow that moves with a life of its own.  Why?  It doesn't even yield striking images.  Transylvania is bathed in a ruby-red light that is otherwise only seen in Italian Hercules films.  There are pointless visual references to the fact that the story takes place during the first years of motion picture technology.  Why, yes: the story is also set around same time as the Boer War, but so what?And the acting - oh, the acting.  Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves bellow at each other in unidentified accents as if vying with each other to see who can make the biggest fool of herself. Winona Rider is cast adrift by the script, but I admit she does what she can.  All of Gary Oldman's talent is devoted to transmitting at least SOME sense of character from beneath his ludicrous make-up and Princess Leia hair-do.  This film is not some minor mishap.  It is a major disaster: an enormous bellyflop that drenches us all in stupidity.",3,8,14,28 October 1999
The Green Mile," If this is Christian allegory, I'll eat my mitre
","Everyone remember the story about Christ and the public stoning?  Well, to the extent that 'The Green Mile' is Christian allegory, Christ said something like this: `Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.  -Oh wait, I'M without sin!'  THUNK!Why does everyone assume that this story even takes place in a Christian universe?  Is it because so many of the characters are Christian?  But this is 1930s American South.  What did you expect?  When a character with supernatural powers of healing lumbers up, OF COURSE everyone assumes the powers are God-given; they assume his perfectly ordinary eyebrows are God-given, too; but the script gives us no reason to suppose that they're right.  Rather the reverse.  There's something random and essentially pointless about Coffey's abilities and actions, something that suits an atheist or pagan universe in which all sorts of oddities just turn up, something which doesn't justify the atmosphere of reverential ponderousness adopted by Frank Darabont and his cast.  (What IS that brown dust that Coffey spews out periodically?  Is it now OBLIGATORY for directors to run the rough footage through a computer and make it worse somehow?)  But it's a very modern sort of paganism.  There's nothing at all beautiful about the magic, which is a telling flaw.Look: it's not as bad as I thought it would be.  I THOUGHT that Darabont would have let the extravagant praise heaped upon 'The Shawshank Redemption' (a good film, by the way) go to his head, and produce a slow, lingering, pompous version of a less interesting story.  Sort of true, but it has its moments (although, as more than one critic I've read has added, 'perhaps by chance').  I thought Tom Hanks would be unendurable.  Surprisingly, he does a good job, all things considered.  I thought the racism would get on my nerves.  It's not really racist.  Coffey is a simpleton, but not because of the rule that blacks must be simpletons; rather, the rule is that good people must be simpletons.  (Coffey is so good he can barely form sentences.)  I thought that the bookends would waste my time and weaken the film's structure.  They do.Objectively speaking, a bad film; but, although my interest waxed and waned, it was easy to stay involved through to the end.",6,3,7,22 June 2000
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," And I suppose `The Pickwick Papers' was Charles Dickens's best novel
","What was the first X-rated animated film?  Most people who have any kind of clue at all would say `Fritz the Cat', but they'd be wrong.  It's `Snow White'! - which received the equivalent of an X-rating in South Africa. (Parts of it ARE grisly, even if the Grimm brothers' story was more grisly still: in the story, the Queen asked for Snow White's lungs and liver - with the intention of eating them.)  This should dispel anyone's idea that the film is all cloying sentimentality.Here's another one: `Gone with the Wind' was the biggest box office hit of the 1930s, but what was the second biggest?  Oh, well, I guess everyone here knows the answer to that one.  It must be said that the second-biggest hit deserved its success far more than the first.`Snow White' can boast other things, too.  But let's not get carried away and say that in addition it's the BEST film of the 1930s, or the best animated film of all time, or Disney's supreme masterpiece, or something silly of that kind.  It clearly isn't any of these things.  Let's distinguish between `good considering that it's a first effort' and good simpliciter, and see how `Snow White' rates.Many things are good simpliciter.  Although the visual spectacle is dwarfed by that of `Pinocchio' and `Fantasia' - to name but two - it's still visual spectacle, and it still works.  Some of the special effects can still startle us.  (I have absolutely no idea how they managed to get that shot of Snow White's reflection in well, for instance.)  The art direction vividly creates a world of cosy dwellings surrounded by choking forest.  The use of colour is as marvellous and subtle as anything the studio produced after 1942 (if not quite up to the standards set by `Fantasia' or `Bambi').  In fact, every single feature after `101 Dalmations' (1961) fails to measure up to `Snow White' so far as colour is concerned.  A muted, watercolour effect (achieved WITHOUT actual watercolours) is enlivened by the rare splash of brilliance on the Queen's cape or on the poisoned apple, but there's more to it than that.  Note how we're not shown a wide palette of colours until the dwarfs appear, when it seems that every hue under the sun makes its way onto the screen.  The dwarfs are the only rounded characters, representing, between them, all aspects of humanity.  (Brilliantly animated, by the way.) It's surprising, or perhaps it isn't, that in an age in which computers allow art directors to fiddle around with the colour balance as much as they like, no-one seems to be able to use colour nearly so effectively.But there are also signs that the art wasn't yet ripe.  The most obvious one is the limited range: `Snow White' never does anything more than a particularly good pantomime might do (which is more than you might think), and while this isn't even a flaw, it does mean that the film simply can't compare with the broader masterpieces Disney produced immediately afterwards (`Pinocchio', `Fantasia', `Dumbo', `Bambi').  In 1937, Disney (and Hand and everyone else at the studio) still didn't know what to do to make a well-proportioned cartoon over an hour in length.  After the dwarfs have been around for a while the film starts to lose its way.  It even has to resort to title-card narration, indicating that while the first part of the story had been thought through properly, the rest hadn't been.  And there are minor technical difficulties throughout, with awkward animation of Snow White here, a clumsy use of the multiplane camera there.Don't get me wrong.  It's a lovely film, among the better ones the studio has produced.  We do it no service when we exaggerate its virtues.",8,4,6,4 January 2000
The Lion King," Simple, effective African panorama
","When this first came out I thought it was a disappointing follow-up to `Aladdin'.  Shows how much *I* know.Perhaps I simply found it hard to classify - it's not a fairytale, it's not (whatever they tell you) a cousin to `Hamlet' - in a way it's not a human story of any kind.  It's moving only in the way in which a nature documentary is moving (although it's certainly not a nature documentary). Our attachment to Simba is the kind of attachment we'd have to any young animal followed around by the camera - we wouldn't be nearly so attached if he were a human rather than a lion.But what the film lacks in humanity it makes up in grandeur, so that's okay. The artwork is spectacular.  I've never seen an animated film so convincingly sunlit: without giving us photo-realistic lighting, it makes us feel the bright African sun on our skin.  Character animation is as good as you'd expect and needs no praise from me.  (The lions are actually among the least smoothly moving creatures on display, but that's what you'd expect from members of the ruling class.)  And note the clever way the film's realistic style is cross-bred with a child's colouring book style in the `Can't Wait to Be King' sequence - it's just so very well done that we couldn't care less if the sequence is a touch contrived.  If the Disney studio has done anything recently to capture the verve of the Pink Elephants sequence in `Dumbo', this is it.I'm not those who think this is Disney's best animated film (it's in the top ten, for whatever that may be worth), and I STILL find it hard to classify, but it's a perfect example of whatever it is.",10,1,4,29 September 1999
Bring It On," Or, as they say, 'bring it'
","One of the chants goes as follows: 'Brr / It's cold in here / There must be some [insert team name] in the at-mos-phere / I said, Brr... etc.'  -What does this MEAN?  Is it possible to work it out, without an extensive knowledge of current Californian slang?Not an unpleasant movie, but the aftertaste is sour.  There was no need at all for Torrance to exhibit moral weakness once (continuing to use the her predecessor's chants when she knew them to be stolen), let alone twice (hiring a shady professional choreographer).  By the time of the final showdown the waters have become so muddied that it's impossible to enjoy ANY possible result.  And is it just me, or did everyone look alarmingly skinny? The choreographer orders one of the girls on a diet after making a wisecrack about her enormous backside, which we see,  and while it would be nice if she DID have an enormous backside, the widest angle lens the cameraman dare use can't hide the fact that this supposedly curvy girl is as thin as the rest of them - i.e., flirting with anorexia.I liked it while watching, largely because its heart's in the right place, and it isn't as idiotic a teen movie as most others.  But on reflection it's seriously misshapen.",7,1,2,3 May 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," If other people would rave about it less, I'd rave about it more
","The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound.  And he wasn't.  This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws.  These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results.  I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong.  A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind.  Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great.  It's a very good story very well told.  Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ...  Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role.  (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.)  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can.  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but I don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it works so well.",8,8,14,7 March 2000
Paths of Glory," Kubrick is master of his craft, but the overall result is second-rate, especially by his standards
","Spoilers below.Apparently it was Kubrick who, during production, suggested sparing the lives of the three scapegoats, and Kirk Douglas who angrily vetoed the idea. You can see why in each case.  Neither ending really works.  There's no way of getting the men off that doesn't feel phoney - but how IS it to end? Three times in a row, that's how.First, there's the execution.  Horrific?  Not really: we'd seen it coming, indeed we'd almost seen it HAPPEN, during earlier scenes which had implied it, in the courtroom and the prisoners' cell.Then, there's the scene at the villa in which Dax lashes out at his superiors.  British critic Robin Wood complained that this was just a cheap way of allowing audiences to vicariously 'tell off' the bad guys.  I'm loath to admit this, given that the claim was made in a poorly argued, spiteful and often embarrassingly foolish book about Alfred Hitchcock, but on this particular occasion, he has a point.  It's a hollow climax.  The fact that Dax's heatedness is partly due to guilt only makes the moment still less convincing.  Oh well.  Again there's the problem: what WOULD work?  It's hard to say.Finally, there's the coda, with the captured German girl singing for the French troops.  Now THAT'S the real stuff.  Nothing anywhere in the narrative prepares us for or plausibly leads into this scene, at once so delightful and so disturbing; if only Kubrick had been less single-minded, and allowed himself more moments like this earlier, we wouldn't feel so cheated when the film ends abruptly at this point, fading out just as it starts to get fired up.  And indeed, all subsequent Kubrick films would be considerably longer than 'Paths of Glory', and contain less padding.  This would be the last occasion on which Kubrick had more technique than he new what to do with.  That technique is already fully formed, in almost every frame from the opening tracking shot to the execution; one doesn't know whether to applaud the technique or lament the lack of overall effect.",7,0,6,13 March 2002
Raging Bull," A more restrained, less full-throated bull than I'd expected
","Here, in a nutshell, is why 'Raging Bull' must renounce its claim to being a great movie: Jake's monologue at the end.  It was lifted word for word from 'On the Waterfront'.  It's not plagiarism: Jake is quoting, and we know he's meant to be quoting, from a movie he's seen, but that's the problem - those quotation marks.  Had they been FAKE quotation marks, had Jake been quoting some non-existent movie, all might have been well.  Had there been NO quotation marks, all might have been well.  (It's not Scorsese's fault if the most fitting words Jake could possibly utter turn out to have already been used back in 1954; if the words fit seamlessly into his movie just as well as into the earlier one, he should simply steal them, and leave the attribution of credit for the fine print at the end.)  The trouble is that when it comes time for a moment of truth 'Raging Bull' is unable to speak for itself.  Its reach exceeds its grasp - it's as simple as that.There are things IMPRESSIVE about the film, like the brilliantly edited fight sequences, and De Niro's performance.  The extended scene in which Jake suspects his wife of having sex with his brother is electrifying.  But in context these aren't enough to sustain us.  The fight sequences are interludes: over quickly, the outcome obvious from the first second, they're one-sentence summaries of the true dramatic action, which take place outside the ring.  As they should be; but this means that they can't carry the film on their own however brilliant they may be (and they ARE brilliant).  And DeNiro's performance needs something solid to spark off, which neither the story nor the other characters provides.Another problem: it isn't really a black and white film.  It's TINTED monochrome.  (I can think of only one instance of Technicolor monochrome actually working: the afterlife sequences in 'A Matter of Life and Death'. There was no tinting.  I think there's a good reason why tinted monochrome vanished off the face of the Earth in the late 1920s, while films were still being ROUTINELY made in black and white in the 1960s.)  The title was in red, and some home movie sequences were in faded colour.  This half-hearted use of colour just looked weak.  Make up your mind: colour, black and white, or (if you're certain you know what you're doing) a combination of both. Not, for God's sake, a BLEND.I was let down when 'Raging Bull' turned out to be no more than an above average Scorsese potboiler, with some outstanding elements.  I really wanted it to be the great film so many people say it is.  A cinematic hero of mine, Michael Powell, greatly admired it, and to some degree inspired it.  I wish it were worthy of him.",4,10,25,20 July 2001
The Iron Giant," Well-meaning, partial success
","We all like happy endings, but this one is an insult.  It's so obviously a blight on an otherwise fine story that we can't even take pleasure in it. Why is it there?I said it's a fine STORY; as far as the telling of it goes, something is lacking.  I'm not sure animation was the right medium for it.  It's fashionable to decry Disney's reliance on such things as fairytales, fantasy, anthropomorphic animals and musical numbers - but these, after all, are the kind of thing that can indisputably be done WELL with animation, and there's nothing wrong, surely, with making sure that form matches content. But animated science fiction like 'The Iron Giant' never quite works.  (No, not even when it's done by the Japanese.)The giant itself is a masterpiece: the precise angles of every spring and hydraulic chamber have been calculated by a computer, then outlined so as to match the hand-drawn characters ... indeed, I get the feeling that the giant could not have been portrayed any other way, which, I'm afraid, means that the film was doomed, since when the humans are drawn and animated and characterised so as to match him, they don't have any life.It's a noble, honest attempt (apart from the ending), pleasing to look at and certainly worth seeing.  The extravagant praise heaped upon the film at the time of its release is probably due to the fact that it HAD just been released, and people hadn't had time to forget it.  Surprisingly little time is required.",7,0,1,24 April 2002
Shrek," It's not just bitter, retaliatory spite - it's CLUMSY, bitter, retaliatory spite
","I can't BELIEVE that this could even be MISTAKEN for good animation.  When I saw the trailer I squirmed in my seat, deeply embarrassed on the animators' behalf.  Could they have got at least SOMETHING right?  Could they have moved at least SOMETHING in a passably convincing fashion?The answer is a deafening no.  The animation is even worse than the cleverly edited trailer let on.  The king's subjects move like mannequins with performers standing behind them, jerking the limbs - which may be fair enough, given PDI's evident shortage of skilled character animators, but when one of the central characters (Princess Fiona) moves in the same fashion, it's time to throw up one's hands in despair.  (Shrek and the Donkey are the best animated of the lot, but even they twitch their facial muscles like people pulling expressions out of a catalogue, even they gesture as though they're posing for photographs, and even they run as though they're trying not to get anywhere.)So how DID this come to be mistaken for good animation?  I think - but this is just a guess - that the public looks for two things in an animated film: glossiness, and frame-by-frame detail.  All the surfaces in Shrek are finely detailed (in an ugly, repetitive, phoney kind of way), and the garishly clashing colours have all been brightly polished and coated with a hideously artificial plastic varnish ... and this, thinks the man in the street, must be what 'good animation' is.  Rubbish.  Good animation involves convincing, expressive MOVEMENT, which makes 'Shrek' the most thoroughly shoddy of the six (or seven, depending on how you count) computer-animated films that have so far been released.  Even apart from the poor animation the art direction is terrible.  Surfaces clash, colours clash, designs and styles and backgrounds clash.  Comic and dramatic timing is off.  And as if all this weren't bad enough, every single thing the animators have placed before our eyes is just god-damned UGLY.  It hurts to look at.  It really hurts.Not that the best art direction in the world could rescue this childish, spiteful, self-consciously flippant story.  Ten years ago the unexpected animated success of the year was 'Beauty and the Beast'; the animated smash hit ten years later is but a shallow mockery of Beauty-and-the-Beast folktales, complete with fart jokes, and the kind of plot complications one normally sees in Sherwood Schwartz sitcoms.  What kind of pea-brained senses of humour do they think we have?  (Hey, listen - they're playing modern rock songs, in a medieval fairytale.  Ha ha, an anachronism!)  I feel as though I've just been harangued by a comedian who thinks his jokes will become funny if he shouts them loud enough.  In reality I was haranged by two such comedians.  One is Mike Myers, who almost manages to pull off the gruff Scottish accent he's trying for; the other is Eddie Murphy, who seems to be under the delusion that the vocal performance he gave in 'Mulan' will be just as funny a second time.  It was only funny the first time because Disney's animators were able to supply the humour.  The PDI animators aren't.The sad thing is we've voted for this kind of loud, vulgar rubbish with our wallets, and now we're going to get more and still more of it until one of us, and it will probably be me, goes insane.  Do you realise that 'Shrek' is so far the biggest box office smash of the twenty-first century, and that it could very well KEEP that title - forever?  It's a depressing thought.",2,11,24,21 October 2001
Vanilla Sky," Made me long to see the original
","Without having seen it I'm tempted to say I like the original Spanish movie better.  Partly it's just induction.  Amenábar, to judge from 'The Others', is a good director; Crowe, to judge from 'Jerry Maguire' and 'Almost Famous', is a bad one: unprincipled, lifeless, addicted to painfully ineffective rock soundtracks, visually inept ... yes, 'Vanilla Sky' could hardly LOOK more enchanting, but this is surely due to cinematographer John Toll ('Captain Corelli's Mandolin'); the film consists of wonderful images clumsily put together.  Look at the very beginning, in which Toll's marvellous bird's-eye cityscape has been cut to ribbons in a - cough - 'clever' way.Look: I'm not complaining.  The story (Amenábar's story) is great.  (I was put off by reports that it's hard to understand.  It isn't.)  Dialogue is smart.  The photography, as I've mentioned, is gorgeous, shot through with fantasy, romance and lovely colours.  It's a good film.  If I didn't know it wasn't original you wouldn't hear me complaining.  But here, for what it's worth, are some reasons for suspecting that the original is better:(1)  'Open Your Eyes' is CLEARLY a better title - at least for this story. 'Vanilla Sky' is romantic but beside the point.(2)  Especially given the new title, Crowe cheats.  Vanilla is the colour of the sky in one of David's beloved Monet painting, and it's meant to be a clue that the skies we see after the 'splice' have the very same fairytale loveliness - but we never SEE the painting in question, so we're not in a position to tell.  It's as if Crowe is frightened we'll suspect something and so, instead of using intelligent sleight of hand, simply whisks the evidence by as quickly as he can.  The ideal mystery is both hard to unravel and retrospectively obvious, but if Crowe felt he couldn't satisfy both ideals at once, he should have sacrificed the first, not the second.(3)  Tom Cruise has too many facial expressions.  I'm not saying he's a bad actor.  Under the supervision of a REAL director - look at 'Eyes Wide Shut' or 'Magnolia' for evidence - he would have had no trouble whatever with the part.  But here, he doesn't just smile at Penélope Cruz: he smiles, then grimaces, then twitches, then smiles a different way, then frowns, and he hasn't even delivered his line yet.  This schtick sometimes works but here it just eats away at his character.  (Cruz is at once quirkier and more restrained - you can see why HE would fall in love with HER - but then, she's played this part before.)(4)  I've mentioned the appalling soundtrack.(5)  Ditto Crowe's general lifelessness.  The twist at the end is precisely what the film needed (yes, it tells us that it was mostly a dream, but what it really tells us is that it was LESS of a dream than it appeared to be); the complete lack of tension is due to Crowe's inability to handle things now that the obvious creepiness is over.  Too many encounters, too many consecutive 'meaningful' moments, no crispness, no overall viewpoint.  It's as if everyone was bored but unable to call it a day.  Yet the material itself is NOT boring.",Null,0,1,4 June 2002
Any Given Sunday," Congratulate me: I have made it through to the end of an Oliver Stone film.
","My headache will soon pass.Of course, I did survive, and survive with pleasure, 'Conan the Barbarian', but this doesn't count.  Stone only wrote the script to 'Conan'.  Since he didn't direct, he couldn't turn his script into a pompous balloon of a film, which is what he did to the script he co-wrote on this occasion.In retrospect I like 'Any Given Sunday' much more than I did at the time. (How could one not?  It's not nearly as painful to contemplate as it is to watch.)  Much of the writing was very good and, after eternity comes and goes, the story becomes involving.  But Jesus, I wish Stone would lay off the hard drugs.  You know what I mean: the slightly shaky, shallow-focus photography; the magazine-layout montages; the artificial drumbeat soundtrack; the sepia tinting, the CONSTANT cutting away to show us something else of no more interest than that which was cut away from; the irrelevant , cheaply 'symbolic' images (at one point we see the Earth from outer space - it's like Ed Wood and his buffalo ... and speaking of buffalo, it's as if the sound effect of footballers pounding into one another was achieved by dropping dead ones into an empty wheat silo).  At least we're spared shots of the American flag this time.  I guess Stone used up his quota of posturing flag imagery in 'Born on the Fourth of July' and 'JFK'. In the end what's most notable about Stone's range of mannerisms is how limited it is - and how limitING.  What could Stone ever DO with his self-conscious edginess except churn out, by the yard, more and more of this kind of thing?Another thing... Remember the scene where the team's owner has a conversation with Charlton Heston?  (Maybe Charlton Heston wasn't playing himself.  Hard to tell.)  Heston walks out after delivering what sound like veiled threats of some kind, and Cameron Diaz turns almost to camera and says, 'What the PHUCK just happened?'  ...Well, if anyone knows, drop me a line.Stone has real talent.  No mere hack could direct so badly.  It's possible - nay, likely - that there is a good film buried under Stone's visual rubble; and maybe even with the rubble it IS a good film, despite everything Stone does to ruin it.But for a better year-long, behind-the-scenes look at a down-on-its-luck football team, I recommend 'The Year of the Dogs'.  It's a documentary, but don't hold that against it - qua fiction it has much more value than 'Any Given Sunday'.  (The only thing Stone's work can claim on its behalf is that it uses higher resolution film.)  And don't worry if you're unfamiliar with Australian Rules.  I knew no more about Aussie Rules when I saw 'Year of the Dogs' than I did about gridiron when I saw 'Any Given Sunday', and in the former I could at least tell what was going on.",6,0,2,21 February 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Hurrah! Perfection.
","Hard to see why it wasn't a wildly popular mega-hit - I have two theories, one charitable, one not.  The charitable theory is that people were put off by the title.  MY heart certainly sank when I heard it.  I mean, just say it out loud - 'The Emperor's New Groove' - now how could a good movie POSSIBLY have a title like that?Yet now, I rather like the title.  It fits the story; it doesn't care if it's fashionable or not; it's just so pleasingly RIGHT - but in an almost indescribable way you'll have to watch the film to find out.  Maybe it WAS a marketing mistake.  Who cares?  I never took seriously the charge that Disney's artistic decisions were made by its marketing department, anyway.That was the charitable explanation for why it made considerably less, inflation adjusted, than every other one of Disney's animated features from 'Beauty and the Beast' on, and failed to even get nominated for a 'Best Picture' Oscar in a year in which they had difficulty coming up with half-plausible candidates.  The uncharitable explanation is probably closer to the truth.  People are idiots.  This is a classic - but it's also animated - by pencil on paper rather than finger on keyboard - so who will ever notice?Doubt me?  You won't once you've seen it.  Everyone to speak of who did reports that it's very, very funny, and they're right - and trust me, nothing is ever THIS funny unless it's clever and witty as well.  It goes without saying that their character animation is unmatched in its brilliance and ... I've already used the words 'humour' and 'wit'?  Well, I'll use them again.  In addition there's a charming dottiness that a merely hip film could never quite capture.  Art direction is perfectly judged and consistent throughout, with a pleasing absence of because-we-can computer effects.Here's just ONE example of what I'm talking about.  One side of the emperor's palace consists of this HUGE golden face, and we find out in a funny scene (but they're all funny) that all excess water is drained out through the nostrils.  But that's not all we see.  We see characters crawling out of the nostrils, we see someone dangling like a big booger on a rope out of one of the nostrils - one snot gag after another - yet no explicit camerawork ever draws our attention to them.  Not only do the characters deliver their lines perfectly deadpan, the camera delivers its images perfectly deadpan.  It's just perfect.Two more things I should mention.  Unlike Disney's other recent features, it never, not even for a second, feels as though the story has been unduly compressed - and at 78 minutes it's a trifle shorter than most.Also, despite the constant hilarity, it's rather touching.No movie I've seen in the past six months has filled me with such joy. Well, perhaps there have been a few others, but they were all made long ago.",10,140,157,29 March 2001
Blade Runner," Jeez, can't we just bury this one?
","Some things just don't age well: computer graphics, self-consciously hip visions of the future, and Vangelis.  (Whatever happened to him?)  'Blade Runner' has them all - indeed, it consists of scarcely anything else.  -It's not just that it's dated.  Even in 1982, it had portentous narration, moved at a snail's pace, and featured characters too world-weary to care about themselves, much less allow us to care about them.  In 1982 we could be forgiven for thinking that it was pretty but empty.  Now we know it's just empty.",4,9,24,16 July 1999
Mr. Holland's Opus," Brainless, and therefore unemotional
","Our society seems to care much more about sport than about music.  Compare the relative prestige of Mr. Dreyfuss and the football coach.  Hell will freeze over before the latter will be forced to suffer the indignities of the former.  But `Mr. Holland's Opus' is just one more indignity - yet another illustration of our lack of respect towards music.Mr. Holland's opus - titled `American Symphony', as if no American had ever written a symphony before - is a bare two minutes long.  It's also twaddle. Holland has reinforced an ordinary, unchallenging tune with schlocky drum beat as if he's afraid we won't be able to tell where the bar lines fall without help.  THIS is what he's been working on all his life?  Ten minutes, MINIMUM, is what we should have had to sit through - ten minutes of GOOD music - if the film was going to be at all serious about paying music the kind of respect we pay sport.It's for this reason we're glad that Mr. Holland gives up his pipe-dream of being a professional composer and in favour of a profession where he might actually do some good; the trouble is, he's not a very good teacher, either. Yes, people are inspired by him, but that's because the script is rigged. Observe:(1)  As his music reveals he has no quality control.  His supposedly enlightened appreciation of the Beatles, for instance, carries no weight at all, since he's one of those tiresome people who like everything.(2)  He's forever having stupid ideas.  He gives a concert for the deaf - BEFORE political correctness of this kind was fashionable enough to give him some kind of an excuse.  He wastes public money on a ludicrous screen of flashing coloured light bulbs that's meant to give deaf people some idea what they're missing ... I mean, really.(3)  He confuses Stravinsky with Shostakovich.(4)  He gives absurd - nay, incomprehensible - advice to students, asking a clarinettist to imagine a sunset and then `play the sunset'.  I can imagine the composer bounding into the room and bellowing, `I wrote a SONATA, not a damned sunset.'The entire movie is just a re-statement of the old chestnut about music being an expression of emotion.  Well, that's NOT what music is.  Music is an intellectual art.  Even the `simple' delight we take in a good tune - not that the film provides us with very many of those - is an intellectual pleasure.  And here's the rub: because we are never called upon to use our brains, because the film never shows us the complicated mechanics of REAL musical instruction or music, we can't understand Mr. Holland's emotional involvement to his craft, either.",3,5,15,21 October 1999
Ben-Hur," Grand if allowed to be grand
","I second the comments of the fellow who said that `Ben-Hur' must be seen on a big, wide screen.  Note (for instance) a particular shot in that scene near the end, where we see Miriam surrounded by darkness, staring in fear out at nothing in particular.  Wyler places her illuminated face at the furthermost left of the screen, with nothing but black to the right: it's very effective, especially after three hours of detailed panorama.  On TV this is just another dull close-up.  By a hundred subtle transformations of this kind is Wyler's breathtaking work turned into stodge.This is particularly fatal because Ben-Hur had some tendency towards stodge to begin with.  The portentous reminders of the divinity of Christ (`He says - he says he IS doing his father's work') are far too many and all of them stage-bound - and what do they REALLY have to do with the story of Ben-Hur, anyway?  Even without the Christianity, Wyler leads us through each scene rather as if the story were some kind of museum exhibit.Only on the big screen does it emerge that this latter feature is a virtue rather than a vice.  After all - at least it's a museum exhibit we're allowed time to contemplate.  Had the film been made today we would have been hustled through in half the time, a long queue of impatient patrons behind us, none of us getting a good look at anything and all of us feeling short-changed.  You have to be prepared to wallow in order to properly appreciate `Ben-Hur'; but if you ARE prepared to wallow, there IS something worth wallowing in.",10,2,5,19 August 1999
Space Jam," So whose stupid idea was this?
","The result of this unholy exhumation of Warner Brothers has-beens is even worse than could have been expected: one of the vilest films ever produced in the United States.  It's unique among bad films in the way it starts at the bottom and digs DOWN.  I mean, it's bad enough that it's a basketball movie - the one thing in the world worse than a baseball movie (although baseball finds its way into the plot as well).  It's bad enough that it's one big Michael Jordan publicity still.  Isn't Jordan just the greatest guy in the world! seems to be the only point behind the opening scenes, especially those honey-covered ones with his family.  (Not his real family.)But then we meet the cartoon characters ...  Whoever's responsible for the animation has evidently mistaken motion for life, because we have all the frenetic running around, squashing, stretching and camera-swerving of the world's most over-produced computer game - all in vain.  Consider `The Rabbit of Seville', with its staid camera work and underplayed Bugs Bunny. It had less than a third of the motion on display in `Space Jam' - and more than four times as much energy.But it gets worse.  Oh, believe me, does it get worse!  I don't know why they made Bugs Bunny the star - he is NOT the most successful creation of Warner Brothers, not by a long shot.  Indeed he's scarcely a character at all.  He's whatever a talented director makes of him.  There's the anarchic Bugs of Tex Avery; the innocent, childlike Bugs of Chuck Jones; the (it must be said) dull, vulgar Bugs of Friz Freleng; and the (sorry) just plain dull Bugs of Robert McKimson.  This Bugs is worse than any of them.  All the inconsistenies have been added together, and new ones added.  Remember what a signal failure the modern-day Mickey Mouse of Disney's `Runaway Brain' was?  You ain't seen nothing yet.I have not yet begun to describe what's wrong with the cartoon bits.  Every second of animation is manic but serves no purpose any of the writers might have had, economic motives aside.  The art direction is just terrible  It's all painfully unfunny.  And remember what happened when the Warner Brothers cartoons began to die in the first place, in the 1960s?  They were no longer fresh, and writers desperately tried to jolly things along by casting more and more characters alongside each other, with predictable results.  Too many zany characters cancel each other out.  Well, `Space Jam' combines EVERY SINGLE Warner Brothers character in the one work, and they all do their zany schtick at once - you can imagine how counter-productive this is. No, on second thoughts, you probably I can't.  It's worse than you can imagine.And it CONTINUES to get worse.  We're introduced to a new Warner Brothers star (star? hah!) - a `sexy' female rabbit, a feisty basketball player who blows back her ears and says, `Don't call me doll.'  Some rap music worms its way into the soundtrack.  The climactic basketball game is even more ineptly staged than the earlier scenes would have led us to expect. Possibly worst of all, the slender and soulless plot is laden with enough contrived sentiment to make us scream, `Oh, come ON!  No-one in the WORLD is so easily manipulated!'One final note - something that pleases me.  `Space Jam' received its first outing on Australian television only because a cricket game which the network had expected to take place, didn't.  THAT puts the movie in its place.  Basketball, too.",2,13,33,6 February 2000
Signs," The idea, the story, and the script, are all excellent - in principle.
","Shyamalan likes the kind of surprise that makes us reinterpret what we've just seen, but he does so in a different way here: he makes us re-evaluate what the film's fundamentally about.Spoilers follow, throughout my review:It's not about the crop circles, and it's not about aliens. It's about God. We think we'll be offered clues throughout, and we are; but they're not clues about what causes the crop circles (Shyamalan simply TELLS us what causes them, as soon as he can), nor are they clues about what the aliens are like, what their plan is, or anything like that (again, what Shyamalan thinks we need to know on this topic, which isn't much, he simply TELLS us, without bothering to drop hints first). They're clues which allow us to deduce (a) that there is a god, and (b) ITS plans and intentions. The twist at the end is that Graham's take on Christianity was right all along.Some people gagged at this point, as though theism was being forced down their throats. I don't think it was. Throughout his last three films Shyamalan has asked us to make-believe in ghosts, superheroes, and hostile aliens that prepare for their assault with crop circles; why can't gods simply be more of the same? The correct way to view 'Signs' is as an apparent work of science fiction that turns out to be supernatural fantasy.You'll note, by the way, that the God in this film is not so nice as all that. He looks out for this family, but in sly ways: he prevents the boy from inhaling poison gas, but by giving him asthma; he secures a supply of ready water all over the house, but by giving the girl a neurosis. And he looks out for THIS family. Why do they in particular get let off? I think it's because the father is a priest - a special servant. If he'd been a Hindu, or an atheist, or even (I suspect) a mere rank-and-file Judeo-Christian, that would have simply been tough luck.Anyway, I think it's a splendid idea. (And you must admit the title is a clever one.) So why doesn't it work?I hate to say it, but while Shyamalan's earnest approach to ghosts and superheroes enabled him to make these things plausible, he manifestly fails... not with God, but with the aliens; indeed, with everything preceding the final scene. But the aliens and crop circles were just red herrings, right? Yes, but for a red herring to divert our attention properly it must be diverting. I think most of us sensed, with the crop circles and aliens and impending invasion, that Shyamalan's heart wasn't in it; the bulk of the film was simply dull, and the alien story all too obviously wasn't going anywhere.The science fiction bit has to work AS SCIENCE FICTION; the rug has to be firmly woven beneath our feet before it can be pulled out from under us. Unfortunately the rug is threadbare. Nobody could watch 'Signs' without choking on the implausibility. The aliens dissolve when they come into contact with water. A single glass of the stuff can be deadly. This is silly enough, but then they come HERE, of all places. Forget the oceans, forget streams, forget little puddles in the ground (I'm sure at least one of their scouts must have stepped in one of these, or at the very least brushed against a plant covered with dew), forget the fact that they are visiting CROPS, which are irrigated; haven't they noticed that, on Earth, it RAINS? They must have been sitting in the sky (in the CLOUDY sky, as we see) plotting their invasion for the one three-day period in the entire history of humanity in which it didn't rain anywhere. And for what? To harvest animals that are primarily MADE of water.These aliens don't bring weapons, they do nothing to disrupt our electricity or communications; in fact, everything about them is laughable.And the humans aren't that much better. Maybe I'm over-estimating the English-speaking world's mass media, but surely a group of crop circles would not be treated as the kind of huge story that disrupts programs on all channels simultaneously, and even if it would be, how could the sight of bent stalks of corn possibly create mass panic? And even if this is what WOULD happen, it's not what I want to see. I want to see at least one of the main characters behaving intelligently. Is this too much to ask?Shyamalan is a first-rate director and the script must have looked good on paper. It must have seemed not to matter that so much of it was half-baked. It matters a lot.",Null,6,11,15 March 2003
Sweet and Lowdown," Proof that Allen still has it
","I didn't find out until afterwards that Woody Allen made it all up - that Emmet Ray didn't even exist.  Nor did my sister.  She thought the lack of accuracy took some of the shine off the film; I thought it made it an even greater creation.It would spoil the joke (well, it's not really a joke, nor a hoax; I don't know what word to use) for Woody Allen to let on that it's all made up, WITHIN the film, even during the opening or closing credits (although if you read the latter carefully you'll notice that 'Emmet Ray' is not credited with performing any of the music, even though Django Reinhardt is).  But the film is neither deceptive nor intended to deceive.  If you know in advance that it's pure fiction then so much the better.  Unlike 'Fargo' (which was good enough not to need to lie to us but did anyway), it never tells us it ISN'T fiction; unlike 'The Blair Witch Project', it has as strong an effect even if we're aware that it's fiction - and treat it as such.It is, in fact, one of Woody Allen's few flawless gems.  (Those of his pictures that aren't flawless gems are, of course, never less than likeable.)  This would be a perfectly constructed documentary if it WERE a documentary.  It's a perfectly constructed work of fiction given that it IS fiction.  Such a balancing act is harder than it looks.  But who cares? What matters is the unerringly apt art direction (nobody does 20th Century period pieces better than Allen), photography, acting and dialogue.  The story is slight but still carries a charge; even if it didn't, there's more than enough of a profusion of interesting narrative AROUND the story (never getting in the way) to carry the movie.",9,10,12,4 April 2002
Amélie," Surprisingly, pretty good
","Nothing - neither the hideous-looking trailer, not the favourable reviews, nor the unfavourable reviews, nor Jeunet's past work, nor Jeunet's expressed opinions, nor what I knew of the subject matter - gave me any reason to believe that 'Amélie' would be anything other than two hours of torture.  It turned out to be a pleasant, pretty damned good movie.  It's certainly better than 'City of Lost Children' (if not 'Delicatessen').  Without the contribution of Jeunet's former co-director (and inspired production designer) Marc Caro, it doesn't LOOK nearly as good as it ought: too many sets and effects are merely digital (the single worst digital effect: at one point, when Amélie is excited, we pan down to a revolting X-ray image of her beating heart), only a third of the cutaway gags have anything going for them, and every single shot has an unattractive yellow colour cast - doubtless an attempt to capture the warmth of old Technicolor prints, but all it does the film look sallow.  Still, the charm is real.In its way.  Most of the time Amélie is a lovable neurotic, but Audrey Tatou has but to look at the camera - or even GLANCE for a moment in the rough direction of the camera - and the character instantly becomes arch and knowing and insufferable.  It's as if she knows she's in a film starring herself.  Amélie (like most of the others) is only worth knowing so long as we can think to ourselves, 'My god, she's really like that'; the moment we suspect she's putting it on, she's lost us.Those who think this is one of the best movies ever made (or the best French movie of the past decade, or some such) can't be getting out much: it's a sweet trifle, no more, no less.  What surprises me is that nine out of ten of those who loathe the film, no less than those that adore it, do so for the wrong reasons.  Amélie's little schemes are NOT the work of an angel: they're not motivated by altruism, most cause at roughly as much misery as they do happiness, one comes to a bad end and another of them was just plain nasty.  That's the POINT.  The film's mostly happy ending is meant to come across like the happy ending to 'Emma' - good fortune rather than good management, and more than the heroine deserved.About the 'McDonalds' criticism: Yes, no doubt the real Montmarte has McDonalds outlets in it.  That's no reason at all to put such things in the movie.  They don't make Montmarte any better and they wouldn't make the movie any better.  This is an important point.  When we find ourselves tolerating the presence of McDonalds outlets even in our fantasies, the battle against them will have been lost: what we have trained ourselves to tolerate in fantasy we cannot help but tolerate in real life.",8,4,10,24 June 2002
The Sixth Sense," About the `surprise' ...
","... I'm afraid I got it almost immediately - that is to say, about a third of the way through.  I mean, Shyamalan drops us a pretty broad hint.  I wonder if he even intended to keep the secret hidden.  I have a suspicion...  I think that Shyamalan's intention was to reveal the secret at precisely the moment I worked it out, possibly by dropping an even broader hint.  But then someone at some preliminary screening failed to get the hint, and Shyamalan thought: `Well, if it's THAT easy to keep people in the dark ...'I'm reminded of `Vertigo', where Hitchcock does something similar: he makes his revelation less than half way through, as soon as he decently can (to the audience, of course; not to the central character).  It must be said that this makes `Vertigo' a better, tenser film.  An explicit revelation halfway through would have likewise made `The Sixth Sense' a better, tenser film; so I'm GLAD I worked things out early on - a friend of mine who didn't found the story a little humdrum, before the conclusion.I don't know that I would have had THAT reaction: even given Shyamalan's miscalculation, this is a beautifully told tale, supported by three perfectly judged performances (Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, who proves that it IS possible for an adult story to have a likeable child as a central character, and Toni Collette - but I'm always ready to rave about her, wherever she appears).  The criticism that the ghosts intrude on what could have been a good domestic drama is entirely misguided.  This is a story ABOUT ghosts intruding.  I found it refreshing to see a fantasy that takes its fantastic premise seriously, without using it as an excuse to cheapen the drama.The sober photography helps a good deal, without drawing attention to itself.  A pity that one of the shots was so obviously swiped from `Poltergeist'.  Not that I minded - this is a much better film than `Poltergeist', anyway.",8,0,0,26 March 2000
Cinderella," A success, on the whole
","People criticise Disney's animated features of the 1950s for being overly glossy, set in landscapes that are much too pristine.  That criticism is just.  And yet it can't be the whole story, because the two least glossy - 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Peter Pan' - are also the weakest. 'Cinderella', on the other hand, set in a world in which the very dirt sparkles, is clearly the best.It DOES look good.  The backgrounds are subtle and consistent; the colours are pure without being too bright.  The animation varies a bit.  I'll swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped - but then, the rotoscoped humans (including Cinderella herself) aren't full-blooded characters in the script, so this approach works well enough.  It's really the animals that make the movie.  I think the studio had never quite used animals in this way before, as totems rather than sidekicks.  The mice, for instance, are the creatures who draw us into the story; but they are really representatives or allies of the more colourless Cinderella.  The cat, Lucifer, is a kind of witch's familiar to the Wicked Stepmother.  (The cat is brilliantly conceived and animated - one of the best feline creations of all time.  The supervising animator was Ward Kimball and he modelled it on his own cat.  I wonder how he put up with the animal.)  This approach allows the animals to steal the show without drawing our attention from the main story.  Their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main story.Among the supporting cast the notable humans are the King and the Grand Duke.  The King is a one note character - he wants grandchildren and appears to have no other desires at all - but the note is struck in a pleasing fashion.  The Grand Duke is a put-upon character who deserves to be lifted out of his sphere as much as Cinderella does.  (Although he, of course, is richer.)'Cinderella' is Disney's return to features after an eight-year hiatus, and neither with it nor with any subsequent movie would he recapture the raw brilliance of his early years.  Moreover he made things hard for himself by picking 'Cinderella'.  She's a passive heroine and there's not much anyone can do about that.  (Maybe I'm wrong on this score - I haven't seen the recent 'Ever After'.)  Nonetheless it is remarkable how successful Disney was in bringing this unpromising story to life, without cutting across the grain of its spirit.",9,46,54,12 August 1999
Rear Window," A classic, but also an old favourite ...
","Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to his apartment for some weeks.  Lacking anything more interesting to do, spends his time watching all the people in the apartments across the courtyard, one of whom, he soon thinks, has murdered his wife ... and so on.  Everyone knows everything about this film already.  Everyone knows that every single shot is taken FROM Jeff's apartment.  There are no gratuitous close-ups of the people on the other side - except, of course, when Jeff gets out his telephoto lens.  So there's never any doubt what we're meant to know, or what we're meant to think that Jeff knows, or anything of that kind.It's soon obvious to most people that the open windows across the courtyard look exactly like movie screens.  Many consider this to be a comment on the voyeuristic nature of cinema.  Hitchcock himself thought as much (perhaps prompted by François Truffaut).  Well, it isn't.  It's clear that Jeff is looking at the lives of the people in other apartments AS IF they're movies, screened for his amusement; but the film is really saying, `Jeff is acting as if he's watching a movie'; rather than, `We, in watching the movie, are acting as if we're staring through other people's windows.'  That's if you MUST read anything at all into Hitchcock's neat visual idea.There's also an uneasy love story taking place between Jeff and a much richer woman, Lisa (Grace Kelly).  Personally, if I were Jeff, I'd forget about Lisa Whatsername and concentrate on Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy), somewhere to the upper right.  But even though the love story is beside the point the film wouldn't be nearly so good without it.  Jeff needs someone close enough to be an ally when the story requires it, not so close as to simply be on the same quest he's on.This is Hitchcock's most purely enjoyable film since he left Britain - which is to say, since `The Lady Vanishes' (1938).  It still works even when you know it all by heart.",10,2,5,13 December 1999
The Truman Show," Damned near perfect.
","My only gripe is the product placement gag, intended to be surreal, but in fact prosaic - as well as silly.  Surely the evil genius behind The Truman Show would have come up with a more creative source of funding...?But we're talking about, what, thirty seconds of footage?  Apart from this `The Truman Show' is a film so finely crafted it sings.  Lovely to look at and intelligent as well.  One of the two peaks of science fiction cinema of the 1990s (the other was `Twelve Monkeys'), but this rather understates the case.  Jim Carrey was inspired casting.  I don't care whether he's technically speaking a good actor or not - he might as well be, since he's perfect as the hothouse-produced Truman Burbank, who doesn't know he's performing in front of a huge audience but who's unconsciously adopted one or two mannerisms of someone who does.Amazingly, some critics have complained about the end, motivated, perhaps, by the vague feeling that no symphony should ever end on a sweet major chord.  Honestly!  Some people wouldn't know a good story if it fell out of the sky and hit them.  The entire film was concerned with the inside of Truman's dome.  We were told, of course, that there was an outside world, as there must be, and we even saw bits of it - but only those bits that were directly connected to the inside of the dome.  When Truman finally, after a GOOD story, dammit, emerges from his egg, the story simply must end: there's no other way to end it.  I hope all those people who wanted to know how Truman will cope with the outside world get their wish.  I hope there's a twee, tiresome, mind-numbingly tedious sequel which tells you everything you want to know.  Serve you right.  You can watch that; I'll watch the breathtaking original again.",10,0,0,18 February 2000
The Matrix," The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...
","... I don't know how long.  Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like 'Independence Day' and 'The Phantom Menace', and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.Much of what you will have heard about this film is false.  You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that.  You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither.  You will have heard the word 'cyberpunk' being used, with the odd allusion to films like 'The Ghost in the Shell' and 'Blade Runner'; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all.  It's really quite charming once you get to know it.  Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man.  Indeed he acts rather well.  Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well.  Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis.  When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched.  But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.Special effects are marvellous.  I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well.  A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in 'The Phantom Menace', that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place.  The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops.  Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes.  I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because 'The Matrix', unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.",8,7,14,5 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Triumphantly prevails against the best efforts of its creator
","Some apologists for 'The Phantom Menace' - not all - defend it by saying, 'Yes, it has its flaws; but it's just as good as the original Star Wars, which had the very same flaws.'After a while it's hard to avoid the suspicion that they're right.  Not about 'The Phantom Menace' being a good film - it's ridiculous to suppose that they could be right about THAT - but about 'Star Wars' being no better. Maybe we've been deluded these past decades.  Similar delusions have persisted for just as long - longer - in the past.  Could it be that 'Star Wars', too, was an unimaginative, flatly directed, kiddie movie?NO!  Most certainly, it was not.  One thing 'The Phantom Menace' reveals, though, is that 'Star Wars' was not fated to be as good as it was.  It became great partly by accident.Harrison Ford has genuine charm; Mark Hamill is perfect as the innocent adolescent with a tendency to whine; Alec Guinness managed to be at one and the old time an old sage and an ex-warrior; and no other female lead had the strength of Carrie Fischer - at least, not while playing a traditional princess.  Maybe this perfect cast was assembled by sheer chance.  (Lucas never replicated the feat, after all.)  But so what?  It's still a perfect cast.  They all created memorable characters; and moreover, as characters and actors, interacted successfully with each other.Mos Eisley's spaceport was also a fortuitous accident.  'Never will you find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy' - yet it managed to avoid being a thriving, respectable looking town largely because George Lucas didn't have the money to turn it into one.  And a good thing too.  It's possibly the most frightening place in the Star Wars universe: truly grimy, light years away from real civilisation, crawling with odd and touchy aliens.With art direction, special effects, and music, too, George Lucas struck gold.  Has a science fantasy world ever looked better?  Have special effects ever succeeded in making such a world look more real?  Arguably not - although this isn't what makes 'Star Wars' unique.  Nor is the music (although the music is part of what makes it unique).  No: there really is magic here.  It sounds a clichÃ©, but there IS something about the simple but honestly pursued story, or the world, or the score, or something, that lifts 'Star Wars' high above by-the-numbers space opera - the same indefinable element that makes 'Das Rheingold' more than a soap opera with occasional sorcery, and 'The Lord of the Rings' more than the first of five thousand episodic fantasy adventures.  This is the company 'Star Wars' belongs in.If the film isn't quite up to the standard of the opera or the book, well... maybe that's because it found its way into such company by accident. It belongs there all the same.",9,0,2,20 August 1999
Thirteen Days," A smart games-theory thriller
","There's not a lot wrong with this film, and what IS wrong is, so to speak, quarantined - it's all somehow connected to Kevin Costner.  It's Costner whose tin ear prevents him from adopting a convincing Boston accent.  (I didn't know it was meant to be a Boston accent - I had to ask an American - and I still don't have a clear idea of what a Boston accent is meant to sound like, but I know phoney when I hear it.)  It's Costner whose greeting-card musings about sunsets jar with the intelligence elsewhere. It's Costner whose family we're forced to watch.  The actors who play his wife and children faced a thankless task - they must have known that they were only accessories, to be paraded in front of the camera for no better reason than to let us know that Costner's character HAD a family ... what kind, who constituted it, what they felt about him and what he felt about them didn't matter; all that mattered was that the family be there, so we'd know that Costner wasn't one of those shifty single types.  I don't know what prompted the director to show us the family itself rather than a photograph of it.  An indefinable sense of duty, perhaps.The story of the Cuban missile crisis is as tense as almost any other, and, Costner-related lapses aside, the film sticks to the story and understands what it is that makes it tense and exciting.  (We even get a clear idea of the pressures that Kruschev would have felt, even though the action never leaves the Americas.)  So absorbing is 'Thirteen Days' that, although I saw it within 48 hours of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Towers (the shock waves were of course felt over here, too), I didn't think of current events once.  If I had I would have been struck by the differences. The Russians placing missiles in Cuba was, of itself, harmless: the danger lay in what the action MEANT.  The terrorist attack was of itself horrific, but it meaningless, which mean's there's no real story to tell (except perhaps the subsequent one of a president so dazzled by the idea of revenge that he was willing to turn an extradition dispute - an extradition dispute! - into a war).  Watching 'Thirteen Days' it seems as though the story was just THERE, waiting to be told ... that the people making the film might have ruined it if they'd been stupid enough but didn't have to do very much in order to tell it successfully.  This is probably false.  But the fact that we get this impression shows how successful the film is.",9,0,0,11 February 2002
Tarzan," Great animation, gorgeous jungle, fine myth, and ...
","'Hercules', 'Mulan', 'Tarzan'.  Three films in a row that are much better than they're generally supposed to be; but each is hobbled by a particularly damaging flaw.  What gives me hope is that it's a DIFFERENT flaw each time. Something wounds each film and leaves it still pretty good but in no danger of being a masterpiece, and it's always a different something.  You can look up my comments on the first two if you want to see what I think the problem is there.  I'll get to Tarzan's weakness in due course.I must admit I was apprehensive when I saw some of the character designs beforehand: the little gorilla Terk, the elephants, Archimedes Q. Porter (the very name makes me wince) - they all look like cutesy rejects from other Disney movies.  But the proof of animation is in the motion.  And the characterisation, as well as the animation, of Terk and Porter, is much more interesting than motionless drawings of them would suggest.  Then there's the marvellously understated tribe of gorillas.  And there's Tarzan himself: a man who thinks he's a gorilla who surfs through a world of branches and vines, and it couldn't look more natural.New computer techniques were used to render the jungle, and as the jungle was everywhere, so were the computers.  Does this make your blood run cold? Well, it ought to.  Computer animation has ruined many a film, animated and live action, before this, and will ruin many a film to come.  And the constant use of computers DOES generate the occasional awkwardness.  But that's the worst that can be said.  Actually, most of the images began life on paper, and the computers just turn them into a lush, three-dimensional world, into which Tarzan and the gorillas fit perfectly.  'Deep Canvas' would have been disastrous elsewhere but it isn't here.In starting with 'Tarzan of the Apes' Disney placed itself in an enviable position - they couldn't possibly produce something worse than the book. Not that I've read the book.  Edgar Rice Burroughs is almost unreadable. He is, quite possibly, the very worst writer to have made any kind of mark on the twentieth century, and that's saying a lot.  He made his mark not by being able to put a sentence together, but by creating myths - or rather, by taking myths that were in the air and putting just enough flesh on them for the public to notice them.  His illustrators really deserve as much credit as he does.  Whatever.  Disney has captured most of the beauty of the Tarzan myth and made a moving story out of it.So what's the catch?  It's the music.  More precisely, it's the baleful influence of MTV, in all its aspects.  Item: we open with a couple and their child aboard a scuttled ship, trying to make it to shore - and no sooner have we grasped this, than does Phil Collins intrude on our thoughts and sing about it.  That it's a terrible song is the least of my complaints. The real problem is that it's beyond all doubt, as clear as the glare of the sun, that the song has no business being there.  Look: if you want to have songs, be honest about it, and make the film a musical.  If you don't want to make a musical then leave out the songs.  It's as simple as that.  In a musical, singing is an extension of talking, and songs can arise naturally out of speech.  Voice-over rock songs of this kind can't.  (An attempt is made to do so in one case, and it falls flat.)  Nor can these rock songs arise out of, or be part of, the musical score.  All they can do is get in the way.  This is particularly glaring here because 'Tarzan' has the ambition and the capacity to be more than a bit of 'Flashdance' rubbish. It's MUCH more than a music video.  So why does it sometimes act like one? -Oh, yes, that's the other problem: some of the editing and camera movement belongs on a weekend top-of-the-pops television program, distracting us from the poverty of the music; not here, disfiguring the animation.These were my thoughts in the first few minutes.  In those minutes are the worst.  It gets much better, largely because the Phil Collins music video style simply can't be sustained.  'Tarzan' is still very good.  It's just that it would have been a lot better if it had been honestly a musical, or honestly not a musical.",8,2,3,2 September 1999
Apollo 13," Don't worry about the capsule - Tom Hanks is aboard
","Every other February an old debate is revived: how, people ask, can a movie POSSIBLY be nominated for Best Picture without its director being nominated for Best Director?`Apollo 13' shows how this can be so and rightly so.  It's good, to be sure, but what MAKES it good?  The story (amazingly, a true one) and the subject matter.  Neither of these were Ron Howard's doing.  He transferred the story and subject matter to the screen and created a good film which, given the potential, falls a bit flat.  Considering the grandeur of space and the unspeakable emotions of astronauts trapped in a flying sardine can, in constant contact with the human race but thousands of miles from the nearest atmosphere, it ought to have been a knockout.But the problem is that there's the usual Howard mannerisms: formula, graceless direction, no taste whatever in music, and, worst of all, an inane trust in brawn, leadership and the power of positive thinking.  This is a film in which engineers and scientists are made to look like ineffectual fools, where people can be made to do the impossible if - and only if - someone shouts at them loudly enough.  I don't want to press this point. `Apollo 13' is far from being the worst offender of its kind.  Most of the film's energy is concentrated where it should be: on the space capsule and the difficulties it faces.A more serious drawback is Tom Hanks.  Somehow it's always Tom Hanks who talks sense, Tom Hanks who settles disputes, Tom Hanks who manifests initiative, nobility, perfect health and good cheer.  The other two astronauts might as well be made of wood.  For a film about three people who share exactly the same fate and have exactly the same claim upon our sympathy, this looks suspiciously like a star vehicle.  I personally find this particularly hard to take, since the star in question gives a typically leathery performance.  More than anyone else he looks as if he never left Earth.Still, he hasn't given a better performance and Ron Howard certainly hasn't made a better film.  It COULD have been much better - but superb though the subject matter is, the film wasn't GUARANTEED to be engrossing - and yet it is.",7,3,5,23 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," It's NOT the darkest of the trilogy - it's the most mature
","`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.'  I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al.  Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish.  But somehow it doesn't matter.  The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway.  Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke.  The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia.  In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay.  It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point.  Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur.  That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER.  This was my favourite touch.  All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong.  The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force.  Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes.  You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V.  There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition.  Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction.  It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.",10,281,369,26 October 1999
Aladdin," One of Disney's weaker recent efforts
","`Aladdin' caused a few ripples of shock in animation circles.  It seemed that Disney had started to pick up some tricks from Warner Brothers, like the rapid-fire topical references and Hollywood-star-of-the-day caricature. Most people were pleased.  It's orthodoxy in animation circles that the Warner Brothers style is a great one, much more lively than Disney's.I beg to differ.  Warner Brothers cartoons are under-characterised, talky, brash WITHOUT being energetic, and they don't age well.  They fail to be comic despite the fact that every other virtue is sacrificed for comedy's sake.  I wish it to be said that none of this applies to the very fine efforts of Chuck Jones.  SOME of his cartoons are masterpieces.  But some - the Pepe Le Pew series, for example - are dreadful; and what has happened here, I think, is that he has been poisoned by the Warner Brothers style. So too has `Aladdin' been poisoned.  In another decade everyone will have forgotten why Robin Williams was meant to be so funny and we will watch the genie only for Eric Goldberg's animation - which is technically superb, but a bit too literal, and too willing to follow Williams's lead.There are a couple of other flaws in `Aladdin' that will become more obvious as the years roll.  For one thing, the computer generated images just don't fit the other images.  (The Cave of Wonders is a visual debacle, which is sad, considering how good the rest of the art direction is.)  More importantly, Aladdin isn't an appealing hero.  Get this for shallow: he refuses to free the genie from servitude in order to perpetuate a deceit practised on Jasmine because of a crisis of confidence that, so far as one can tell from the opening song, he doesn't really feel.Of course we all know the film was a huge success, and it's not hard to see why: it offered the best character animation in the world, expertly staged songs, an uncynical look at an old story - all of the usual things, with a luscious princess thrown in.  Like ALL of Disney's recent animated films it's easy to enjoy.  But consider the other two of these films worked on by the team of Musker and Clements: `The Little Mermaid' and `Hercules'. `Aladdin', as much fun as it is, clearly lacks the heart of the former and the energy and technical brilliance of the latter, without offering a value-for-money trade off.  But don't let this stop you watching it.",8,7,12,30 September 1999
Gladiator," Take 'Spartacus' and subtract: beauty, heroism, intelligence, competent editing ...
","I love ancient world epics.  Before seeing 'Gladiator' I didn't think it was possible to make one that isn't worth watching; and, indeed, Ridley Scott hasn't done so either, although he certainly seems to have tried, and his film certainly is bad.  For a film set in Rome at its most magnificent there's remarkably little spectacle (and what little there is is largely computer-generated - appallingly).  For a film so reliant on fighting the combat scenes are confusingly, ineptly, MORONICALLY, shot and edited. Scott's latest fascination is with triple-framing.  Every moment of combat looks as if it was lit by a stroboscopic lamp.  This, plus occluded angles of view, over-use of extreme telephoto lenses, and rapid, more or less random editing - all combine to make it next to impossible to tell what the hell's going on.  How I miss the clean, clear spectacle of 'Spartacus' or 'Ben-Hur'.  The other thing I miss is a score by Alex North or (better still) Miklós Rózsa.  Hans Zimmer's music (think of 'Crimson Tide', but more minimalist, more new-agey, less tuneful) is horribly out of place (and just not very good); it combines with the stupid camera-work to make the whole film play like a music video - or a 154-minute trailer for something else.Well, not entirely.  Every so often - not VERY often, mind you - some STORY coalesces out of the cinematic debris, and some grandeur rises above the digital fog.  As I said: is it even POSSIBLE to make an ancient world epic in which this never happens?  But such moments are rare, and usually undercut by some conceit of Scott's.  They never last very long.I'm amused (I know people tend to say they're amused when they're really annoyed; okay, perhaps I'm also annoyed) by those who say that this is a story of simple heroism, unsuited for cynics.  The reverse is true.  If you're more cynical than I am you'll probably like the film better.  Two instances:(1)  When Lucilla meets Maximus in his cell, the latter has suddenly become the most cynical, world-weary, why-bother person on the planet; he refuses to so much as lift a finger to help Rome despite the fact that he has nothing to lose, and despite the fact that quest Lucilla offers him neatly coincides with everything he's been dreaming of for the past year or so. Where did THAT come from?  I'm sure that one of the bullet points in 'Screenwriting for Dummies' is: 'make your hero a reluctant hero'; although I expect they go on to add, 'but not reluctant to the point of selfish petulance'.(2)  Commodus threatens to kill Lucius unless Lucilla betrays all the good guys.  Well and good.  But then we cut IMMEDIATELY to shots of the consequences of Lucilla's betrayal, and it becomes clear that we were meant to infer that Lucilla would, of course, turn traitor - Scott didn't think it worthwhile to show us what Lucilla's response was.  The possibility that she would make a sacrifice for the cause she knows to be right is not meant to even OCCUR to us.  (And it's not as if her character is so clearly defined that we have any idea how she, in particular, will act.  It's clearly meant to be a GENERAL LAW that nobody makes noble sacrifices.)The last point reminds me how poorly defined ALL the characters are.  Some blame the acting, or the dialogue, for this, but there's nothing wrong with either: in fact, most of the lines are stirring - 'corny', my foot - and impeccably delivered.  The problem lies deeper.  'Gladiator' has a disjointed, stitched-together script filmed by a director with no clear idea of what it was meant to be about.P.S.: Surprisingly many people, including professional critics who should know better, have exhumed the mouldering old chestnut about how bloody modern cinema is the modern equivalent of the Ancient World's bloody gladiatorial combat.  Some even think that when Maximus cries out, 'Are you not entertained?', he's talking to us.  Well, Scott's film is stupid in many ways, but this isn't one of them.  Cinema is FICTION: it wouldn't appeal to us if it weren't.  Gladiatorial combat was REAL: it wouldn't have appealed to the ancients if it weren't.  Modern sport, and modern documentaries, are much closer to being modern equivalents of gladiatorial combat; but why suppose there IS a modern equivalent?",5,0,1,13 August 2000
Pocahontas," Whenever I see this film it's always better than I'd remembered.
","So why don't I have a better memory?  I think it's because the flaws in `Pocahontas' are of the kind most likely to be noticed by lovers of fine animation like myself.  The following paragraph will read like nit-picking, but I must write it and get it out of the way.The canoes, the GARISHLY coloured bark on Mother Willow - almost all of the computer-generated bits and pieces just look ugly and ill at ease in this hand-drawn world.  Just because we CAN use 3-D software, doesn't mean we MUST ...  And Disney's fabled character animation is a bit of a let-down, too.  The general character mould is meant to evoke a kind of cheap wood-cut, which is fine, but the style doesn't appear to lend itself to fluid or convincing or appealing movement.  The English crew have little personality, and the Native Americans might as well have been carved as drawn.This does NOT apply to Pocahontas herself.  (Who is, incidentally, a gorgeous babe.  This is not important.  I just thought I'd mention it.) During the scene in which she and John Smith first meet face-to-face we're as mesmerised as they are: it looks as if they're just standing still; but, of course, if they WERE just standing still, it wouldn't work at all. THAT'S animation for ya.  Meeko, the comic relief raccoon, is another triumph.  I've always thought Disney's animals to be far funnier than, say, Warner Brothers', largely because the animators are expressing the animal's character with the drawings rather than pasting gags on top of the character: were I to argue this case at length, Meeko would be one of my star exhibits.My only real complaint about the story is that we're rushed through it a bit too quickly.  Twenty more minutes - fifteen - could have made all the difference.  When will the day come when animated films aren't all the same length?  But it's moving enough even so.  If animation still lives in a children's ghetto, we should blame not the creators - who lavish more imagination and feeling on their work than is ever lavished on stuff like `Ten Things I Hate About You', to far less critical reward - but the audience.",8,1,4,14 October 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I can't BELIEVE that anyone would think that this one is the best.
","I mean, there are people who think that `Raiders of the Lost Ark' is Spielberg's best film.  I'm not saying I agree with them - I don't - but I can see how such a case would be made.  Could anyone reasonably make this claim of the third Indianna Jones?  Hah!  The idea is absurd.The first two films have a single narrative thread.  Their before-the-credits establishing scene really does establish something (and both scenes are very well staged, unlike the analogous scene here); and thereafter it is one SINGLE roller-coaster ride (almost literally, in the second movie).  Here we have a series of merry-go-round spins.  I'm not saying that this doesn't have its moments.  It does, and I enjoyed them. But they've been stitched together in the most unconvincing fashion.  This means that when a scene falls flat - and be honest, it DOES happen - it REALLY falls flat.Furthermore, the music isn't quite as good the third time around.  Nor were the settings.  It's incredible that a paid scout searched all of Europe and came up with locations as drab as these.  I've already mentioned that the script was weaker than before.  But this is all tolerable; what REALLY lets the film down is the concluding sequence in that temple place.  I've seen game shows that had more class.  Some think that the inspiration for the series of inane riddles Indy must solve did indeed come from some tacky game show; but I know better.  I'm willing to bet that either George Lucas or Jeffrey Boam was once a dungeon master, used to leading characters like rats through a maze in precisely this fashion, with precisely this set of contrived puzzles and silly booby traps.  The cheesy fake rocks and fairy-floss cobwebs set it all off perfectly.And another thing: Indianna Jones is beginning to look like a bit of a dill. This is the third time he's started out sure that a fabled artefact wasn't really magical, only to find out that it was, after all.  (I don't know how many times this pattern repeats itself in the television specials.  I have more sense than to watch them.)  Doesn't he learn from experience?The third Indy film still puts up a good show, don't get me wrong, but it can't compete with its predecessors.  Spielberg and Lucas should quit while they're still ahead.Sorry.  I forgot those television specials again, and the proposed fourth movie ... should HAVE quit while they WERE still ahead.",7,0,4,28 February 2000
Princess Mononoke," I'm sure you're very good at what you do, Doctor Fell
","Disney animation has linear detail, economical drawing, and extremely sophisticated motion.  In a word, it's classical.  Japanese animation has vertical detail, heavily etched backdrops that verge on being overdesigned, but rudimentary motion.  Japanese animation is baroque.  (Disney cartoons tend to have better draftsmanship, but this is inessential to the difference in style.)  The styles could hardly be more fundamentally opposed, and you like either one or the other.  It's hard to have a strong taste for both. To lay my cards on the table, I like the Disney style: I consider it more subtle and versatile, and at its best it lives and breathes like no other kind of animated image.  Still, the Japanese style has its strengths.It's essentially a static art: silence and stillness are what it conveys best.  It's interesting to compare 'Mononoke' with 'The Emperor's New Groove'.  The latter film is unusual for Disney in that silence and stillness are used with surprising frequency, but the effect is always unstable: stillness is a kind of dissonance, something requiring resolution. The moments of silence and stillness in 'Mononoke' are consonant and complete in themselves.  There are some lovely static tableaux in which the dialogue - if there is any - has as much time as it needs to breathe.The Japanese style is also good at conveying a sense of place.  (Disney can do this also, but neither as quickly nor as economically.)  Usually it's an urban place.  Think of definitive anime, and most Westerners think of 'Akira' and 'Ghost in the Shell', which are very urban indeed.  (My personal favourite in the genre is 'The Crimson Pig', which, if not quite so urban, is heavily technological.)  'Mononoke' is different.  Most of the action takes place in the untamed, and I mean untamed, wilderness; now and then we enter a village.  Surprisingly, even these settings are solidly realised.  A single drop of water falls from a pine tree and lands on someone's face, and at once we feel that we are in the middle of a dense, damp, green forest.The story is deeply weird, in the best Japanese tradition - in particular, in the tradition of this particular director - and intensely sad.  The hero's quest is fulfilled, in a sort of a way, but the film does not end in triumph.  Instead of thinking 'good, X happened', we think, 'oh well, at least X happened'.  -I must admit I was surprisingly unmoved.  Something about 'Mononoke' distanced me; it may have been the facelessness of the central hero, it may have been the overall style; if the latter, it may have been entirely my fault, which is why I'm unwilling to commit myself to any kind of criticism.  All I know is that, much as I admired parts of 'Mononoke', I am unable to love it.",6,27,61,14 June 2001
Jurassic Park," I want to see Tertiary Park
","I'm amazed how badly this film has aged - it's only been six years.  I enjoyed it back in 1993, but on seeing it again last night all manner of uncharitable thoughts kept popping into my head, chief among them the impression that Spielberg, who had lavished so much effort on `Jaws', just wasn't trying.The dinosaur mystique is hard for me to understand.  Sure, they're fantastic beasties, but so are many other extinct animals; and if I had a choice I'd rather pay to see a mammoth, or a giant wombat, or a tiny Eocene horse.  But PART of the dinosaur mystique is bound up with the idea of a lost world. That's what really thrills people about `King Kong'.  The island Spielberg's dinosaurs occupy, by contrast, is prosaic and modern.  No doubt it was a deliberate artistic decision to combine dinosaurs with cars, electric fences, cafés and air vents, but it's hard to find two consecutive shots that don't remind us of the modern world in some way, most of the charm of the creatures is thereby lost.  This is the more inexcusable in a film that throws everything else to the winds - story, character, wit, plausibility - to concentrate on the strangely attractive flavour of dinosaurs.As for the dinosaurs ... Some time before `Jurassic Park' there was the Cambrian explosion, when all manner of special effects techniques proliferated; after `Jurassic Park' all, with the exception of computer animation, became extinct, or virtually extinct.  It's not the film's fault. Most of the dinosaurs on display did NOT originate in the belly of a computer; those that did look neither better nor worse than those that did not.  The computer animation is more than adequate but charmless, with something subtly but deeply wrong - exactly like all subsequent computer animation.  The art hasn't progressed.  `Jurassic Park' is still as good as it gets.So far, so bland: what's intolerable is the preaching.  This was the only thing that irritated me in 1993 and it irritates me more now.  The moral of the story, with which we are repeatedly bludgeoned, is twofold: (a) people who think they don't like children are either mistaken or villains, in either case in need of therapy; and (b) man should not play God - any attempt to develop some biological science will strike us down, because of chaos theory, or quantum mechanics, or some such.  This is all piffle.  But it's not the ridiculous messages that annoys me: it's the fact that I'm being preached to AT ALL, and so clumsily.  (Did you, too, develop a desire to throttle Jeff Goldblum in mid-speech?  I hope so.)  `Jaws' didn't pretend that it was a statement about how we will be struck down by divine anger if we arrogantly disregard nature and go swimming at the beach.",7,4,7,28 November 1999
Rock Star," The Fallacy of the Like-Minded Soundtrack
","Not bad, not great, not anything much, but it gets better as it progresses, and it ends up being more than the lump of bland nothingness that 'Almost Famous' is. Herek makes only one real mistake...I call it The Fallacy of the Like-Minded Soundtrack. This is the story of a musician from the 1980s: the 'Steel Dragon' songs he slavishly reproduces, strangled high note for strangled high note, and the songs of his own (well, one of them) which he ends up singing instead. So we hear a decent amount of 80s-style rock. But what of the moments when nobody is singing? What should the soundtrack consist of then? Why ... more 80s-style rock, right?Wrong. The actual songs, the songs that are being presented to us, come across as just another part of the musical wallpaper (which, for the first part of the movie, is just too darned relentlessly loud). You can't really HEAR when the songs that aren't part of the story end and the songs that are begin. And rock songs make poor soundtrack material even in the best of circumstances. While I'm aware that a traditional orchestral score might clash with the subject matter, and synthesised minimalist drivel is too bad in itself to be worth considering, there IS at least one other option: silence.",Null,1,3,17 September 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Gold
","At least the Coen brothers know how to use modern technology, if nobody else does.  That wonderful sun-drenched look is the result of an effects house digitally manipulating the original photographs to desaturate the greens - but at least there WERE original photographs.  Computer MANIPULATION of images need not be a great crime.  The manipulation here is at heart optical; they could, in principle, have used a film with an unusual colour response.  -It's computer-GENERATED images that are particularly evil, and the Coen brothers, bless them, have no truck with such things.  That wooden house we see at the end, for instance, is a model.  Maybe a few directors will notice how good that sequence looks; maybe it will even persuade them to stop reaching for the computer animators at the first sign of difficulty, like a hypochondriac reaching for the antibiotics.'O Brother, Where Art Thou' is the Coens' best work since 'Barton Fink', a constantly entertaining, visually beguiling, musically delicious film that I had great difficulty understanding.  Others had to explain it to me, and I still don't get everything.  I don't get the title, for instance.  It comes from 'Sullivan's Travels', and while I haven't seen that film, I know the story: film director Sullivan is tired of churning out shallow entertainment, and sets out to make a socially aware piece of moralism that will expose the plight of the poor; he plans to call it 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'.  -I get the reference, but I don't get the joke.  Would Sullivan's film really have looked anything like THIS?Of course not.  The Coens have succeeded in doing what others have merely attempted - they've turned a twentieth-century era into a mythical, prehistoric golden age.  They make it seem effortless, too, as though all they had to do to make the enchantment lying over the landscape visible was place a filter over their lens and turn it ninety degrees.",10,0,0,30 August 2001
The Godfather," Solid, classy, all but perfect yet not quite great
","What happened to the sure-footed director of this film?  How did his impeccable craftsmanship ever give rise to such things as the slipshod, overwrought 'Dracula'?SPOILERS FOLLOWIt's hard to say, but there IS that moment near the end, which some mistake for a climax or even a turning point:  Michael is in church, at the Christening ceremony of his sister's child; his henchmen are in various positions around the city (one in Nevada), poised to murder the Corleone family's most powerful enemies and rivals.  Coppola introduces a device he had hitherto studiously avoided: fast cross cutting.  'Do you, Michael Corleone, renounce Satan?' asks a priest.  Cut to some act of violence.  Cut back to Michael: 'I do.'  Cut to violence.  'And all his works?'  Cut: Blam! Michael: 'I do.'  Cut: another  stylishly staged shooting.  It's a wonder Francis Ford Coppola doesn't write the words 'Please note the irony' across the screen.I don't fault the decision to use rapid, gliding montage at this point, given that it ISN'T a key moment, merely one that plays out decisions we had seen made earlier, but there's no denying that in the way it's done Coppola both hits us over the head and goes over the top (some of the killings are too operatic for what is essentially a stealth operation) - although thankfully, less far over the top than he probably planned, since the gravitational pull of his carefully made world remains strong.I must stress that this excess doesn't matter HERE.  I mention it because it's perhaps the seed of something that would grow and grow and ultimately choke later Coppola films.  Just a thought.  'The Godfather' itself is perfectly crafted and shaded.  There's the well realised and well photographed settings, both 1940s New York and timeless Sicily; there's the believability and depth (when The Don is shot and thought to be dead, the tears look unforced and REAL, which I doubt you could say of those in any other gangster film); there's the sense that we know these people, culturally homogenous yet not at all the same.  There's Nino Rota's wonderful score.  I don't think this is a GREAT film, in the sense that so many other people seem to think it is.  It doesn't matter.Interestingly, the morning of the day I saw 'The Godfather' (I'd seen it before, but this was the first actual screening), someone wrote to me to protest that my harsh comments on Marlon Brando based on his performance in another film ('Viva Zapata!') were unfair.  What I'd said had struck me as obvious: that Brando's introspective style reveals his character far more to him than it does to us; that he acts without INTERacting, failing to mesh with the rest of the cast; that he mumbles too much.  In my reply I had to admit that I hadn't seen many Brando performances, and of the earlier ones, only Zapata.  I was almost going to admit that his performance in 'The Godfather' was faultless.  A good thing I didn't!  When I saw it again I realised that Brando may have sufficient grip on his character not to let the film down, but just barely; again, he introspects too much, interacts too little, and mumbles.Yet the acting in 'The Godfather' and the film overall are too strong for this to matter in the least.",10,16,33,17 April 2002
