The Blair Witch Project," Awful
","After hearing of the Hype around this movie I was prepared to go and see something SPECIAL.  Didn't know what to expect though, but SOMETHING.  Unfortunately that was exactly what I didn't get.  There are exactly two things nice about this movie: The fact that the movie was a commercial success despite that it only costed $100,000. And the idea of making a movie as-if it was made by amateurs and real.But that is probably the problem of this movie too, if you see it in a Sneak Preview - and you never heard anything of it before - you might think it's scary because it APPEARS real to you. But after hearing about the commercial success and the facts behind the movie (i.e., you know that it is NOT real) then all there is left is a terribly cheap, shaky, amateurish movie that doesn't scare at all.A big disappointment.",3,0,1,29 October 1999
Troy," One of the best movies I've ever seen.
","I saw this movie in 2004. So why write a review now, in 2018 you might ask? Well, because I suddenly realized that I was thinking in awe about this movie again, as I have done many times in the past. The sheer joy I feel, the adoration, the memory of experiencing the perfection of ... well, Brat Pitt. And no, I'm not in love with him that wouldn't be related to the movie. No, it is THIS movie and the performance he gives in this movie. The picture that is portrayed of the demi-God Achilles will always stay with me and I have to thanks Brat Pitt for doing that. What has stayed with me all those years are especially the fight scenes; the WAY he fights. The fact that he is so good at it that... well, no spoilers. I've always considered the requirements for a 10/10 to be: Everything has to be perfect: the story, the music, the special effects, the main character, hell - my requirements for a 10 has been that I need to fall in love with the main character, buy posters of the movie and go see it three times in a theatre; and I don't remember any of that... but if a movie manages it to make think about with strong emotions of thrill, still yearning for that same experience again as if it was a drug that I got addicted to after a single use FOURTEENS YEARS after I saw it... then it deserves a 10 too. Cheers Brat, you made it to my short list of 'immortal' people.",10,1,2,16 August 2018
Cloverfield," What a waste of time and money
","Shaky, sick making, blurry images... the WHOLE freaking movie long. This could have been such a good movie. Why did they have to spoil it completely? Man, my room is still spinning and I feel sick. I couldn't bare to watch the screen. Sorry, sometimes I like the funfair but NOT for 84 minutes on a row thank you. The story is OK, I guess; and the sound is normal too (that is, it's stereo and strangely enough doesn't rotate around like the camera constantly does; apparently this portable cam was equipped with two hifi stereo microphones with gyroscopes or something to keep them in the same position). Unless you really, really enjoyed watching the Blair witch project, no NOT go to see this movie. And if you go, you'd be insane to accept any other seat that one in the far back.",3,3,6,4 April 2008
Pitch Black," Unrealistic, incomplete movie that fails to be what it tries to be.
","SPOILERThe following contains information about the content of the movie.  From the tag line (fight evil with evil) we can get an idea of what was the idea behind the movie: A terrible dangerous killer, who later turns into a hero because only his 'talents' can save the survivors of a spaceship crash. The opening of the movie starts with picturing HOW dangerous the killer is in a way that seems to be stolen directly from movies like Con Air. However, then the rest of the movie fails completely in realizing that expectation: the killer turns out not to be dangerous at all and doesn't show any special gifts except being strong and (how convenient) being able to see in the dark. Finally the movie gets very unrealistic, while at first the dark creatures seem to be able to kill a heavily armed group of people in a steel bunker, later it turns out more and more to be possible to walk outside with just a flash light and only seeing a creature once every 10 minutes or so, where are the other billion creatures suddenly? The whole movie gave me the idea of being too little of a good book to get across what the original writer much have intended. Perhaps half of it should have left out so the rest could have been worked out better.",6,0,0,4 July 2000
Gladiator," Excellent movie, unfortunate that the General misses human emotions.
","This movie left me with the expression of just one man: The Gladiator.  The rest I forgot as soon as the credit titles began.  I was impressed and that says a lot for someone who sees about three movies every two weeks in the past years.  When I think about what impresses me about this character, who is actually just an ordinary hero, almost invincible, who can slaughter six man in a few seconds without blinking his eyes... what made this character so different, then I come to the conclusion: his modesty. Never before I have seen a Man this Great and yet so modest. And because THAT is what makes this movie so special, what leaves you with feelings of admiration for this Great General (`It's just a movie!', you keep telling yourself), the choice of Russell Crowe as actor seems excellent.  However, this movie could have been so much better, if only Crowe would have shown more humanity. What I miss is (emotional) pain: what this man did go through in his live should have left marks in his face, in his eyes that saw more then an ordinary man can bare. Unfortunately, in this respect his character is rather flat, emotion-less almost. That makes him not-so-human, and therefore touches the spectator less deep in his heart. Too bad; not perfect, but still excellent.",8,0,0,26 May 2000
