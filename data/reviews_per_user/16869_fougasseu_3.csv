Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Marx Brother
","A very funny movie using a classic comedic structure: disorienting word-play, getting the best of the bourgeois, zany and shocking - George S. Kaufmann (writer for the Marx Brothers) would be delighted. Sacha Baron Cohen is hysterical, and what a great moustache! But I prefer Charlie Kaufman. I think Carrey and Ferrell and Stiller are far more original and adventurous with their work, every bit as anarchic, and far less predictable. I found the hooker with a heart of gold especially disappointing. And I know films are now made to be ugly, but I can't resist the rant - Gondry makes beautiful images, Peter Sellers appreciated the artistry of what he was up to, and look at the Mr. Hulot films - very, very silly - yet stylish and masterfully shot. And then there's the magic of Chaplin and Keaton. Is this love of amateurish film-making just a fad, or is this all that American directors, inspired by HBO rather than theater, are capable of?",7,2,8,16 November 2006
Quiz Show," Paul Attanasio's masterpiece
","Paul Attanasio may be the best screenwriter alive. This movie's script challenges every actor, and each actor rises to it - particularly Paul Scofield. His story captures the corruption of the creative class by capitalism, or more precisely the damage done to the imagination by the artists of capitalism, the admakers, better than anything ever put on screen. The story takes place at the zenith of the power of the packaged goods marketers as they wrestle the networks into submission. You don't see the ads being made or any overt presentation of the marketers at work. But they're there, behind the scenes; you can feel the pressure on the programmers. I'd love to see how Attanasio and Redford would look at what they're now doing/trying to do with the internet.",10,3,5,6 November 2006
The Dark Knight," The jokes on us
","I may run out of words to end with 'less'. Mindless, witless, a view of the world that's hopeless. Horrible acting, writing, editing, lighting and music. I've seen it all before only done better. Nicholson's turn at Joker was far, far superior. Ledger? Mirthless, just a distracting concoction of tics. Bale? Who knows? His augmented voice and masked face made his 2-dimensional performance meaningless. Dent? What a horrible performance, something you'd see on 'Knot's Landing'. Where have we come as a society? Kubrick made 'A Clockwork Orange' in '71, a devilishly clever, mean and stylish film that pushed the limits when it came to on-screen violence. His young monster, Alex, played by the brilliant Malcolm MacDowell, was a thing to behold. Now we have families taking their kids to the '08 version of ultraviolence and yukking it up. The dark night of America film-making is more like it. Are we really this numb, are we really this nihilistic?",1,69,162,4 August 2008
