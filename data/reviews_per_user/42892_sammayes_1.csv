It," This could be one of the all time greatest failures
","There is no possible way that anyone could seriously rate this movie even close to the scores on this site. This movie is the first movie I have walked out of in 10 years. I am a huge fan of this genre and this to me was the ultimate disappointment. I actually cringed at a lot of the 'horror scenes', very very lame.At 45 minutes in I had to check my ticket to see how much longer I would have to endure the pain. After realising how much longer I had to go, a swift exit took place. I hope you read this review before wasting your time and money.",1,79,168,9 September 2017
