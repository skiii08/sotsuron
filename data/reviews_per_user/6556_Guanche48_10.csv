It," Not scary enough.. more and adventure between kids.
","Don't understand the high ratings. This film is only entertaining and well made, the scifi effects are great and also de little actors.;)

A Star Is Born," I was desapointed
","WHAT A HIPE WITH THIS MOVIE! Dont understand!!
Specially the music in A star is Born is great.
We already knew that Gaga is an artist.Sure. Cooper steals the show, he was awesome!
I also thought it was nice that this movie is not a chick flick romance, certainly not.But..all the drama .. the whole roller coaster feeling..good feeling bad feeling..super good bad again... pufff.
I prefer a real roller coaster in the amusement park.",6,1,3,11 April 2019
