Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Made total sense... and I didn't even see the first Kill Bill (slight spoiler)
","I heard this movie was really good, but was skeptical from the start because I hadn't seen he very first movie. Not to worry, the plot makes total sense and this movie fills in all the details you need to know. Further still, the acting was really good and so was the script. Probably the most disturbing thing about this film, I found, was the way Beatrice finishes off Ellen. It just looked so realisitc, painful and way too gory.  Very realistic indeed. I think the star of this film however, is Bill, the actor did a great job of portraying a villain with a sense of humor so well that it helped carry the movie when Uma Thurman's acting looked awkward. Speaking of Uma Thurman you can tell that she's not at all a very good fighter - she looks too awkward at moments and you cant tell some of the work has been done by a stunt double.I was also surprised at how graphic this movie is when you factor in the horror of Beatrice being buried alive. One minor gripe however is the way they show which chapter of the novel is playing, as well as that stupid actor that plays Pai Mei. I know him well. He stars in a lot of crappy chinese soap operas. Not only was it clear to me that he couldn't act at all but that they got the translations done all wrong. I understand Chinese perfectly and it only makes Uma Thurman sound stupid by giving simple answers to complex questions. Nonetheless, this movie is noteworthy.A",9,1,2,8 May 2004
Coraline," Surprisingly one dimensional...
","Let me frank here: I love Neil Gaiman (his work, that is), I love Henry Selick, and I love animation. Coraline was the first Gaiman novel I ever read, and when I found out they were making a movie, I literally leaped for joy! Then I saw the clip online and thought it was weird for Coraline to have blue hair -- okay, not bad. Then I heard she was going to be voiced by Dakota Fanning (Ew), that they rewrote the story so that some kid named Wybie would be in it, and that They Might Be Giants would supply the soundtrack. My hopes were fading...I'll sum it up for you right now: this movie has the BEST animation Henry Selick has ever done -- bar none! The visuals are breathtaking--no, spectacular! The music was catchy, the jokes were good, and the acting first class. The problem is that the pace of the story moves too quickly and none of the characters, except for Coraline, are given any kind of development.Coraline obviously proves to the most engaging character throughout the story, but everyone else feels sorely misplaced. Her parents are mean to her one minute, then nice to her the next; Wybie is zero one minute, a hero the next; and the cat goes from being a sarcastic freak of nature to being Coraline's best friend. What happened here? There is virtually no character development.And what about the plot holes? Yes, I'm sorry to say that even in a film as beautiful as this there are plot holes. Such as, why on earth did Wybie give Coraline the doll in the first place? Why didn't the Other Mother just give it to Coraline herself? Why isn't Coraline the least bit scared when she sees the Other Mother for the first time? Would she really be courageous enough to eat there after just having eaten in the real world? How come Coraline's parents can't remember what happened after they've been released from the snow globe? And why does Coraline act like nothing is wrong when the cat suddenly begins talking to her in the tunnel. Obviously, I'm over-analyzing things here, but many of the film's faults are glaringly on the surface.Overall, I have to say that The Nightmare Before Christmas still remains my favorite Selick film. Coraline is GOOD, but at least ALL the characters in Nightmare were one- dimensional, whereas Coraline is the only three-dimensional thing going.",6,6,15,7 February 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Barely made sense
","Honestly, it feels like watching King Kong all over again. In King Kong it took about an hour and a half for Kong himself to finally show up, here it was about the same, needing a full hour before the villain Davy Jones shows his big tentacled face. I won't repeat what other reviewers have said other than the fact that this movie could have been reduced by an hour and not have lost any of the drama and excitement it contained. Remember Hollywood: Less is more. Did we really need to have the whole cannibal tribe thing when it wasn't even part of the storyline? How about the whole Liar's dice scene which served absolutely no purpose at all. Is it so much to write a scene that has meaning to it? Finally, I didn't really like how this movie was a melting pot for combining all different sea legends together into one big conglomerate mess. But then again Disney never comes up with anything original anymore, does it?",6,1,3,13 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Yes it was a good movie but I just wasn't in to it. *SPOILERS*
","Well,I just came back from the theater and let me tell you, I am dead tired. The movie itself was well written and exciting but probably because it ran too long, that my brain feels asleep. I don't seem to remember a lot of the plot, though I know enough to tell you I liked it. You can always count on Disney to create a good family movie for all to enjoy, though I have to say this is a little bit beyond Disney with all the fighting and blood that was shown. I found those two blittering idiot pirates to be awful in providing comedy relief, to me they were just plain annoying. Johnny Depp seems like an ass to me, his performance was good but I just didn't get into his character. Just getting slapped by a bunch of women and then shooting Barbossa in the chest seemed unoriginal to me. Some parts to me thought that they should be serious and not funny but hey, everybody has their own opinion.It's definitely one of the better movies out there this summer. As far as story goes, this movie has more twists and turns than a water slide and water world. I recommend anyone watch it, if they are looking for a good summer flick. Hopefully you will have the patience to sit through this for 2 hours and a half hours.",Null,0,1,26 July 2003
Spider-Man 2," Best comic book movie ever! - (SLIGHT SPOILERS)
","When I first heard this movie was coming up, I thought: 'Why Bother? It's just going to be the same thing over and over again'. Good guy goes insane, captures Mary Jane and Spider-man saves the day. But boy was I in for a surprise.Probably the most surprising thing about this movie is how all the characters have matured into real people. Before they were all cardboard, now you get a feel of what they are like inside. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance of Spiderman who has to work extra hard to pretend that he doesn't love Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) and it's touching. However, I think the whole thing of creating sympathy for Parker was a bit over done. It's not bad enough that he loses the girl of his dreams, but he loses his health, his job, his home, etc. It almost becomes a comical joke and it's because they didn't have anything to build on from the first movie.The script was also far superior as well. They managed to raise the stakes emotionally, as well as the danger. Dr. Octopus was also a much freakier and stronger villain than the Green Goblin ever was because you knew he was mentally ill, insane and a powerful freak. I also liked how they adapted his arms to each have a mind of a own and to be able to see - which I think is really cool. Even better was the fight scenes and the webslinging was even better!.Now here's the spoiler!. Some people felt disappointed with the ending because they felt all the loose ends were tied up when Peter Parker and Mary Jane chose to be with one another. Well it's not and here's why. In the comic book itself much of the story is dealt with Mary Jane being Spiderman's sidekick. Though she has absolutely no powers at all, they make a great team couple and are supposed to throughout their lives. They're young, funny and go through a lot of mischief and adventure. It's also interesting because you get to see what it's like to be the wife of a super hero.The second dumb part is when the trains people see Spiderman with his mask off. One of them says, 'Don't worry Spiderman, we won't tell'. Yeah right, how can you ever trust a 7 year old kid.Last but not least, I thought it was STUPID to have the Green Goblin come back. Harry will now mostly become the new Green Goblin. That sucks because I want to see a new villain and not see them reuse the same ones over an over. Of course, there's no final word on whether or not Doc Oc  is dead - for I certainly like to see him back once again to fight Spidey. 
Despite it's flaws and the fact that it may have been a little too long. It's a worthy movie.9/10",Null,0,0,12 July 2004
Batman Returns," Strong characters, so-so script - spoilers possible
","I really like this movie. I really do. The movie stays true to dark, gothic theme which is Batman and they do a really good job of patching up Batman's past from the last movie, including why vicky Vale and Bruce never got together. The only thing I think they could have done better is add more justification to the villains and their motives. I mean how does an insane secretary all of a sudden know how to climb buildings, fight kung-fu style and do all those insane acrobatics?. And how is it, that penguin all of a sudden decides he wants to kill children, and join in a crusade to kill Batman just because they had only one brief encounter. Still, despite the flaws it a great movie. It's too bad the movie ended the way it did though, with Batman's love life gone ( once again) and Selina Kyle (Catwoman) down to only one life. I'm wondering why they don't bring her back, cause they should.",8,0,0,23 March 2003
Finding Nemo," A Worthy Movie (contains minor spoilers)
","After seeing the God awful Bug's Life, I never wanted to see another Disney film again. When the previews for Finding Nemo came out, I dismissed the film as being another lousy attempt for Disney and Pixar to make money. You see I grew up in the 90's era, where all the characters would fall in love at first sight and where all of a sudden characters would get up and dance, sing and would have stupid animals that would tell dumb ass jokes to get you to laugh... So therefore I thought this movie would suck.How wrong I was.It was great from beginning to finish. The story as you know is about a insecure Clownfish named Marlin, who because he lost his wife and all but one of his children, is overly concerned about his remaining son Nemo. One day Nemo gets captured and Marlin swims out to try and save him. Along the way he bumps into a fish named Dory, with very short term memory, and so the adventure is begun. I'll be honest in saying that this IS the BEST Disney movie I have EVER seen. It is the BEST written and has the best acting. The story, alas, is not original but it is considered fresh considering all of the other movies they've made in the past. It rocks! The acting is great, the musical score is beautiful and the animation in this one is awesome. Kudos to writers on this one.Apparently someone finally woke up and realized that some us, just don't like singing songs anymore and stupid annoying animals. They've finally been able to target a wider audience by making the story appeal to adults more while keeping the characters appealing to children. I love it.So be sure to see this movie, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it.

Juno," Like a breath of fresh air....sort of
","I saw this movie last week and thought it was excellent. Now I'm starting to wonder why I liked it so much.The premise of the story (as we all know) is this: 16-year-old Juno McGuff gets pregnant and gives the baby away. There really isn't that much plot to it. In fact, your average Spot book has more plot than there is to be found in this movie. What really makes Juno unique however, is the approach with which they deal with the subject matter.In the real world Juno would probably have been disowned, had an abortion, or committed suicide. But instead she is portrayed as a brash, disgusting, overconfident tomboy, with a Gung-ho attitude about everything. Her parents are surprisingly supportive and there are just a lot of cultural issues (such as abortion clinics, condoms, and drugs) to poke fun at.Here's what I didn't like about the movie: <ul><li>The joke with the boys in their short shorts got lame pretty quickly.</li></ul><ul><li>The Paulie Bleaker character doesn't do anything to own up for what he did to Juno. Sure, I know he doesn't have much confidence to begin with, but it sure makes for a weak and unlikeable character. Juno ends up having to do everything.</li></ul><ul><li>And that love song at the end destroyed my suspension of disbelief. In what was already a whimsical and zany world, I find it difficult to find two lovers (er, kids) singing love songs simultaneously to one another. Did we really have to sit through the full two minutes of it?</li></ul>Bottom line: This is probably the most original movie I have seen in a long while, offering one of the most memorable characters in ages. It's freshness is akin to eating a piece of moldy bread and liking it because of the flavor.",6,0,5,3 February 2008
Spider-Man 3," And I thought Catwoman was bad!!
","Catwoman may be a terrible movie ,but it is God compared to this load of crap...Let's get this straight, there are two things fundamentally wrong with this film: A shallow plot that is devoid of all logic and the fact that they tried to cram about two hundred comic books into one movie. For those of you who haven't seen Spiderman 3, it would be a good idea to park your brain at the door before stepping inside the theater. A lot of things simply make no sense and feel forced in order to get their point across. For example, I thought that Peter Parker and Mary Jane had already tied the knot given the way Spiderman 2 ended- at least it was implied that way. MJ leaves Harry standing at the altar in order to be with the man she truly loved - Peter- the dweeb she kept putting down until she realized it was him who was her Knight in Shining Armor all this time. But no, one innocent kiss on stage to another woman, causes MJ to throw a fit and suddenly they no longer love each other. Hello? Does that sound credible folks? Apparently Mary Jane feels very insecure, as him saving her LIFE twice in the previous films doesn't count as being loyal. Other examples of things not making sense, include Harry choosing to help Spiderman defeat Venom and Sandman after Peter nearly beat him to the brink of death. He threw a grenade at him that exploded one inch away from his face, permanently scarring him. Now for some reason he is still alive and easily forgives Pete, after his butler tells him that his father died by his own hand. Really? How did he figure that out? And if the old man figured it out then, why is he telling Harry now? Why wait until he starts killing people? Some people have tried to explain that the serum that Harry drank kept him alive, but if his father could easily die with two blades piercing his stomach, don't you think a grenade would have blown Harry's head to bits?The second problem, as I mentioned before is the problem of cramming too many comic books into one movie. A lot of things simply feel under developed and rushed. In the comic book, Peter Parker gets under Eddie Brock's skin a number of times, breaking him to a point where he can't take it anymore, forcing him to seek revenge with the aid of the suit. In this movie all Peter has to do is prove that Eddie's photograph if Spiderman is a fake and apparently Eddie was dumb enough to bring the evidence along with him and lay it out on the table for Peter to find. Eddie loses his job and loses everything in a minute. They also tried with little success to make the Sandman a very tragic character, almost every time you seem him he is looking at a picture of his daughter and shedding tears. But it is never explained what his daughter is sick from nor why it costs all millions of dollars to cure her. Perhaps, it would be better to force a surgeon to perform surgery on her instead.Finally, there is a lot of cheesy romance in this film that forces Peter and everyone else to cry every 10 minutes. The scene with Peter and Mary Jane crying at the bridge sent everyone in the theater roaring with laughter. It's so bad and felt so rushed that you have to see it to believe it.So was there anything good about this film? Well, sure, the cameo by Bruce Campbell. He was hilarious. Then again, they had to write a good part for him, otherwise he'd probably sue.",1,5,11,5 May 2007
Corpse Bride," Great animation, razor thin plot
","Tim Burton has to be one of my favorite directors of all time. It's not just his talent but his sick and twisted imagination that makes things interesting to watch. Things don't just come to life , they are elaborate and pop out at you, dragging you into the world he creates. Such is the case with Corpse Bride. It's a delight to watch but unfortunately, is only able to hold itself together with a razor thin plot that keeps the mess from falling apart - just like a real corpse.The plot holes in the movie are many and its only fair to list a few. For one, all the characters in the film are one-dimensional and its very difficult to sympathize or know any of them. Why is Emily so desperate to wed? Why is Victor such a wimp? What is his background? The characters might as well have been labeled character A and B, for the film never bothers to answer them. Then again, the film was too short anyway.Another big plot point that ruins the film is the love between Victor and Victoria. Funny how their names are similar isn't it? Both characters suffer from what I call the Titanic syndrome. I remember when the Titanic first came out in theaters, everyone cried when Leonardo Dicaprio's character died. I thought it was stupid because the two hadn't met for more than 3 days and nobody in the real world ever falls in love that quickly. It's the same thing with Victor and Victoria, both characters have NEVER met and yet in their first encounter they swear eternal love for each other. I don't know about you but I don't find prearranged marriages very romantic, nor can I understand why Victor falls for Victoria when he spends all of his screen time with Emily, the Corpse Bride.Still another point to be considered is the world of the dead which Emily comes from. For one, how is it that Victor is able to live for several days down there without food and water? I also don't get how Emily knows everyone down there, when she says she spent all of her time lying under a dead tree, waiting for her love to free her. So which is it? Is it her spirit that inhabits the underworld or her actual physical body? She can't be in two places at the same time!Now for some good points.The animation itself is probably the best I've seen for a stop-motion picture to date. It flows much more fluidly and natural than anything I've ever seen before. Even the colors are good. There are also a lot of heart-warming and funny moments, all carefully crafted, which make it an enjoyable movie. Even the musical scores by Danny Elfman are good (well, not all of them). For the most part it seemed like a convenient way to explain things that should have been part of the plot. 'So why are you dead Emily?', 'Good question Victor, let's sing about it!'All in all, I do recommend this movie and DID enjoy it despite it's flaw. It makes for a great flick for kids and adults for all ages. Just make sure to park your brain at the door when you watch it.B",7,0,0,8 October 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good when it could have been great... (Spoilers)
","*SPOILERS*
Unfortunately, I never did see both full length movies of T1 and T2, however I did see the ending when I tuned into the TV. I personally enjoyed this movie very much. It even made sense to the viewer who hadn't seen the original two made by James Cameron. The special effects were awesome as was the car chase scene. I also give kudos to the writers for making the TX feel more like a cold, cut throat mechanical object, than just a piece of eye candy and of course she had lots of fight in her. There was also plenty of comedy relief thoughout and it was good to see the film poking fun at itself and at the Terminator franchise.So, where does the film fall apart?. In my opinion, it fell at the ending. It all went down hill when Arnold aka T-850 fails to kill John Connor and just shuts down. That seemed a bit too easy for me, when it had potential to be a lot more. Also, when he boots back up he is back to normal without TX's malicious programing controlling his mind. Again too easy.There was also the final confrontation, where they try to escape to the air base. The TX just gets crushed by the helicopter and comes back out without her liquid metal on. What happened to that?. I guess, I'm not too much into saving the world type stuff and about big bombs about to go off. Maybe its because Hollywood endings always have people defuse the bomb at the last second or because I can't see it as happening when I'm sitting omfortably in my chair. The death scene between Arnold and the TX was good but in my opinion typical. And at the end John and that other girl are in the base. Safe from all the nuclear missles going on.It was great on one hand, because the Terminator was smart enough to change course and accomplish his mission when John threatened to kill himself, and yet it just feels so hollow, I mean you knew he was never meant to die and so what, he lives. Sure there's meaning to the ending, but it just ends so abruptly and is so pointless ,only setting itself up for another movie.",8,0,0,13 July 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Awesome sequel (spoilers)
","I saw terminator 3 recently and decided to backtrack to see what the other two movies were like. I have to say that I loved Terminator 2 and that it had a much better plot and overall feel to it than Terminator 3. That's not to say that Terminator 3 isn't any good it sure has the best thrill ride and special effects out of all of them.Terminator 2, really had brains. It was really a smart film.  Probably the best theing about thing movie was the feel of the characters, between John Connor and the Terminator. I particularly enjoyed the moral issues discussed between them, they just seem so innocent: ' You can't just go around killing people', says John, 'Why..' asks the Terminator and John can't come up with an answer. Or when John, after seeing the two kids play with pretend guns, asks him whether or not human kind will make it. The Terminator simply replies ' You humans have a tendency to enjoy destroying yourselfs', or something like it.The plot was well thought out and the story well linked. Although they never did mention why terminators assume human form or why this new terminator looks the same as the old one. This movie definitely deserves its spot as one of the top 50 or so ever made.By they way, I particularly enjoyed the way the terminator reloads his gun with simple turn of the wrist during the chase scene . Very cool.",9,0,0,19 July 2003
Spider-Man," Seemed to easy
","WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS . For those who've already seen the movie, read on.
I think there's something lacking whenever a comic book is converted into a movie, and that is the presence of smart villans AND heros.Personally, I think the transformation of Peter Parker into Spiderman was too easy. One minute I'm a weak, emaciated, like hamster cowering in the corner of my cage getting picked on, and the next minute I'm kicking your ass and liking it too. The transformation from wimp to hero seems to lack character growth.The producers decision to have Spidey have web shoot out of his glands instead of a gadget he makes, for the sake of saving all the smartsy stuff, also does damage to Spidey's character. In the comic books and cartoons, Spiderman is known to experiment, invent and even investigate. With him working at the Daily Bugle (or is that superman) don't you think he could - out of curiousity - do some research and find out who Green Goblin is?
By the way, I think Tobey Maguire looks nerdish even after his transformation into Spiderman. And another thing, since most people know the story of Spiderman why not start in medias res and have him flash back to the time of the spider bite. That way, it would've saved a heck of a lot of time.Now to move on to Mary Jane, they only meet up and chat one-one-one about 4 times in the movie and all of a sudden when the movie ends she's in love with Peter Parker. Why does love always seem like magic in movies? Figuring out he was Spiderman by a kiss was also lame. She always seems to get in trouble too. Who would want that kind of a girl?
The Green Goblin was dumb. They never went into detail as to why he chooses a goblin mask. The part when Spiderman is paralyzed, why didn't he just take off Spidey's mask and kill him on the spot if he said 'no' to his proposal. And why do all villans ask the good guys to join them? Finding out Spidey's identity by a cut was also too coincidental. Isn't the scene where the Goblin pretends to be a women screaming in the fire, painfully obvious?The part where Norman Osborne is talking to the Goblin mask is hilarious!'What should I do ' says Osborne'A good warrior, attacks neither body or mind'.'Then what should I do?''Attack the heart, Osborne ! The heart!'The end where the Goblin gets killed by his own glider was stupid. Didn't he know that Spiderman has a spider- sense and isn't a comment like 'God's be with you' a dead give away? Also, I can't keep getting over how Harry Osborne could not have known his dad was the Goblin, after all, hasn't he been acting weird lately?In short, I didn't think there was enough action to make it an action movie. Spiderman took thugs down too easily. It would've nice to see scenes of slapstick with Spidey webing a guy and repeatedly hitting him in the face, kinda like a yo-yo effect.The web slinging was great. That was the only plus.",1,5,12,18 May 2002
The Exorcist," I just don't see it (Spoilers)
","I just don't see what's so scary about this movie. I rented it, under the pretense that I would be scared to death since I had heard so many good things about it. I have to admit that it is a extremely disturbing and creepy film but there definitely wren't any scary moments.There are to me, also a lot of plot holes that I missed or didn't pick up on. Regan, for some reason gets posessed by the devil but its never mentioned why. In addition, we see a early picture of the Exorcist in his younger days during the early miners dig but I just don't see why that scene is important (I rented the unedited version by the way...)All in all, you see the doctors throughout the movie try to figure what's wrong with Reagan before taking her to see a psychiatrist. To me, this movie is part entertaining and silly. It pretty much looked as if little Reagan was actually high on drugs or something.. nah, they just had it the other way around.",Null,1,2,29 August 2003
Spirited Away," IF you really want to know if it's worth it....
","* YES, IT DOES CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERSSpirited Away is a story about Chihiro, a smart young girl who - thanks to her parents stupidity -  end up getting lost in a sacred forbidden city where spirits come to bath and relax. But you already knew that before reading.I can tell you up front that the story is pretty much a copycat version of Alice in Wonderland, only with a much darker plot. For example, in the preview you don't get to see Chhiro's parents mutating into pigs after eating the forbidden food there. Nor is the fact mentioned that the guy who turns into a dragon does so because he sold his life to witchcraft. Or is even mentioned that part of the scary old women's pets is three decapitated heads rolling and jumping around. So think twice, about it if you want to bring kids to this movie ( then again Disney probably cut all that out, or adlibed it differently to change the story). My little cousin, from what I hear ran out of the theatre scared as hell... but then went back in later on because he was curious to see how it would end.
So how about good points?. Well, I can tell you that the animation is superb. I mean really good. It's a mileu - where you get to wonder in awe of the scenery , rather than concentrate on the story. The music is also very well orchestrated, giving a great overall feel to the movie.
Now the bad points. The plot stinks. I mean it, there are literally so many holes and details that if you're not paying attention to the whole thing, you'll get confused very soon. The question, as to whether or not Chirhio is able save her parents is pretty obvious and as to why you would care is another question that never gets answered. Overall, after seeing the movie you'll feel it's pretty pointless.  Oh yes, and they also dubbed it - another bad thing. I can tell by watching the preview that the dialogue has changed. I watched the chinese version - and there is a difference. So , should things not make sense , just blame the translators.So what's my judgement?  YES - go and see it. The movie, I think is worth seeing at least once, especially on the big screen, and no more afterwards.",1,23,95,8 September 2002
Batman Begins," This movie ruined Batman for me
","Whether you like this version of Batman or not ultimately depends on how faithful you are to the classics. I am a huge fan of Batman the Animated series created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini, as well as Tim Burton's Gothic interpretations, not to mention the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.Batman to me has always been a tale of how good people fall into sin and how everyone has a dark side. The star of the show isn't Batman himself, but the supporting cast of villains, each committing acts of crime out of revenge or redemption. All of them had a heart and were once human, now trapped in a shell of a monster. The profound thing about it all, was that Batman himself was just as insane as the people he brought in, only he believed he was fighting on the right side of the law. You get none that here. All villains commit random acts of terror, determined to destroy Gotham because they think its a cesspool.But I think the thing that bugged me the most was how they fundamentally changed Bruce Wayne's character in this movie. In the animated series, he is indeed portrayed as tortured soul but he also comes across as being a highly intelligent and sophisticated man. He was able to take down guys like Superman in Dark Night Returns, simply because he was able to outsmart him and was very resourceful. A key point that they missed in this movie was the inner struggle Bruce Wayne has to want to give it all up and settle down with someone he loves. One of my favorite moments for example, is in Mask of the Phantasam where Bruce Wayne is at his parents grave in a thunder storm, begging them to release him of his vow. He is in love with Andrea and wants to spend the rest of his life with her. He cries and begs for a sign, in which Andrea then shows up and two begin crying in each others arms. Bruce was actually happy. It wasn't until Andrea left him that he accepted his fate as Batman. This Batman has none of the human qualities from above. He can't laugh at himself and is full of pure anger and rage. He's almost like Spawn. In fact, the parallels are dead similar with him scaring the crap out of his villains before taking them down. Spawn of course is cooler given that he actually gives the bad guys what they deserve by decapitating them limb by limb.Okay, so let's not compare animation and comics, let's just focus on the film instead. Does it surpass in Tim Burton's movies? Hell no. Sure, Tim Burton didn't have all of the special effects technology that we have today but his twisted imagination allowed him to create a world that was totally Gothic and true to me. I liked the idea of smiling clowns blowing fire from their mouths and monkeys armed with machine guns. The Batman of the past was actually fun to watch as he'd stuff the fiery baton down the jesters throat and pick up two mimes and knock them out by bashing their heads together. It was always the cutest of things doing the evilest of deeds, like the marching penguins in Batman Returns.Burton was also faithful to the love interests of Bruce Wayne as well. It was always set up like a Greek tragedy with the love of his life being the villain he tried to stop. I also like the old Batman costume, the old batmobile and the old batwing. Michael Keaton also played a much better Batman than Christian Bale in that he always looked cool and in control. In this movie, Bale sounds like he has a frog stuck in his throat whenever he tries to speak and the mask he wears makes his head look a bit too big.But I think the crushing blow came at the end, when they tried to reintroduce the Joker. I loved Tim Burton's version because the Joker's whole purpose in that movie was to harass Batman, being that he killed his parents and was the one villain who could outsmart him. I hated how they changed that because Batman in reality is just as responsible for putting villains in his own life as they are for fueling his drive for vengeance.Overall, I have to say that this movie was bad. The fights scenes made no sense whatsoever and were put together by a bunch of stunt men, made up of 60 different takes. It totally blew up everything I came to love and respect about the dark knight and lacked the emotion and humanity of the original series. We didn't need another movie explaining his past, Mask of the Phantasam did a much better job with a lower budget too.I understand that they want to remake Batman for the new generation of fans but if this is the best they can do, then I'm hopping of this train right now. In the meantime, I'll just stick to the classics to remember Batman in his glory days.",1,129,267,19 June 2005
Transformers," American Pie meets Transformers.
","This was one crappy movie and a pain to watch. Just hearing Optimus Prime utter 'Oops my bad', made me want to bolt for the door. Anyway, here is just a brief summary of all the good and bad this movie has to offer.The Good:<ul><li>The transformations- I'm surprised at how well they made the transformations work. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Megatron don't look half as bad as I thought they would. It's nice to see the parts warp and change instead of watching these big blocky characters that were in the cartoon.</li></ul>The Bad:On my, where do I start...<ul><li>The jokes were awful. For some reason they decided to make this movie as a crossover between American Pie and Transformers. Bumblee 'lubricating' the man and Sam masturbating, just wasn't funny. The only people who were laughing in the audience were little kids.</li></ul><ul><li>The humans stole the show. I thought Transformers was supposed to be about the Transformers themselves, who each had unique personalities with a little human action thrown in the background. Instead the tables are reversed, where we are FORCED to spend lengthy amounts of time with characters the audience truly doesn't give a rat's ass about. Who cares about Sam Whitwickey? Or that smart programming chick? Or that fat donut eater? Who honestly gives? This is a Transformers movie folks, not a love story with some dumb robots thrown in for kicks. Oh and Sam himself, was super, duper irritating and annoying.</li></ul><ul><li>The choreography was terrible. Some fight scenes were cool enough but the shaky camera movements and extreme closeups made it difficult to tell what was going on. The fight between Megatron and Optimus proved to be extremely disappointing, as we are only given a few shots of Optimus punching and tripping Megatron, while the army tries to destroy Blackout. </li></ul>-They completely destroyed the Transformers back story. Those even remotely interested in the Transformers will know that they came from Cybertron and that their ship crashed on Earth only to be revived centuries later. But here Cybertron is destroyed to pieces with no chance of it ever being revived. Well, I guess the Transformers are screwed folks ... but they already were when Michael Bay decided to direct.In short, if you were expecting to see a movie about the Transformers, you were sadly mistaken. Be prepared to spend hours focusing on Sam and his loser girlfriend instead. Also, why the hell did it take an hour and a half for Optimus Prime to show up in the first place- that to me, is a disgrace.",1,138,220,14 July 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Well I saw it...
","If you want to see heart wrenching emotion, please tune into CNN sometime to check out the latest Tsunami disaster updates. There you can hear stories that really will break your heart. Maybe it's just all the emotion of the new year ( along with the fact that someone so gladly spoiled the movie for me before I saw it) but I personally found this movie to be dull, manipulative and uninvolving.It reminds me of the time when I saw the Titanic and saw people around me crying, while I was glad that Leonard DiCaprio Died. I did cry when I saw Forrest Gump, but this, well it didn't leave me feeling anything, simply because there are too many plot holes.I can't review this fairly, without going into some of the SPOILERS so here's A WARNING NOWFirst off the acting was great, what more can you expect from Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood and Hiliary Swank.But there are a lot of things that just don't make sense.One. Frankie (Clint Eastwood) is having bad troubled relations with his daughter who never opens any of the letters he sends. AND YET the cause of the bad relationship is never explained. IT JUST IS. I thought that they might go into his psyche as to why he feels the way he does but the movie never really develops this.Second. AFTER the bell rings, Maggie goes back into her corner and then gets decked in the neck, paralyzing her from the neck down. Now, the problem was is that the dirty fighter was declared the winner! WTF. In real life, she would have been disqualified because the bell ALREADY RANG before the punch was thrown. Maggie would be declared the champ, even though, she could never defend it. But instead she loses.Third. Maggie decides she wants to die by way of Euthanasia. It is to be a 'peaceful death'. Okay, so first Frankie takes off her mask. She can't even breath without it, wouldn't it cause her to sputter, choke and die first. But instead she is happy. So he then pulls the plug, which would have caused all her body organs to die. And then, sticks the needle in her arm killing her. Seems like they should've got it the other way around. They should have stuck the needle in her and let her die, before unplugging the machine and pulling off the mask.Oh and Morgan Freeman is a dummy in this movie. He doesn't do much in the way of plot. He explains to the audience in these fancy montages that Maggie just keeps getting better. It would be nice to actually SEE her getting better instead of this quick change from waitress to champion.And then we're supposed to cry when she dies. I'm sorry, I'd rather watch Forrest Gump all over again.",Null,0,4,30 January 2005
The Dark Knight," This movie was a joke...
","C'mon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this.The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledger's last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker.To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that I've just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be.Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. This movie has no plot. 'The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham,' is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why can't Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a 'civilized' manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one.Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesn't give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes 'Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids,' and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean.Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolan's vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfman's theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out.",1,134,328,28 July 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Very profound, strong ending and quite funny... (SPOILERS)
","I can totally understand why Ken Kesley was so angry for changing the movie from Chief Brodman's perspective to McMurphy's. To me it was really the Chief who learned to change but the audience related more to McMurphy, as he was such a dynamic character.To me this movie is extremely profound, in that the men in the mental institute constituted a reflection of society which was being contolled by the beliefs fed by them by Nurse Rachett. She was trying to help them with her therapy but it only made things worse as they became more weak and needy as a result. The truth was that there was nothing at all wrong with any of them, some of them just didn't have the courage to live in the harsh reality called the world and some were just convinced that they couldn't do anything and so did't. McMurphy cures them by helping them to be free, by having fun and enjoying the wonders of life. In the end they become so much more better off from his treatment than from hers.I guess in real life we do the same don't we?. We listen to pop psychologist and gurus talk, while letting counselors and suppossed experts make all of our decisions for us. We then become dependent on their advice and lose confidence in our abilities.  Not to say that all of them don't have anything useful to offer but when you start to rely on them and instead stop relying on yourself then you're in trouble.There were some sucky things about this movie that I noticed.SPOILERS!  SPOILERS!I have very little sympathy for McMurphy for not escaping when he had the chance. The window of opportunity was wide open and yet he overslept  but then again this is part of his character.I did have a lot of sympathy however, when McMurphy got the lobtomy at the very end. It turns out that society won and that his reward for making life in the institute better for others, was to be degraded into being less than human when compared to the other patients.Finally, you realize that the it's Chief's story and that he learned from McMurphy's example. He then breaks loose from the chains of inferority and powerlessness and escapes. That was beautiful.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Even Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett couldn't save this one...
","For those Star Wars fans who don't know who Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett are, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Lawrence Kasdan was the screenplay writer who helped edit out most of Lucas's God awful dialog and Leigh Brackett, was the one who wrote the original screenplay Empire Strikes Back. Maybe they deserve more credit for making Star Wars the success that it is because, without them the franchise just sucks.Okay, so how about this movie? Well it had it's moments, especially when it came to the fight scenes. Yoda vs. Sith. Good. Obi-Wan vs Anakin. Good. How about General Greivous and Obi-Wan? Also good. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and saved the movie from being a terrible mess.If it's one thing that really ruined the whole movie it was the non-existent character development of Anakin Skywalker. It is here that Geroge Lucas tries to transform the pansy into the dark lord that we should all be afraid of. Lucas throws around plenty of 'motivation'. His wife is going to die; he is denied the rank of master; he must spy on his beloved mentor Palpatine and so forth. It just feels so rushed and delivered with no emotion whatsoever.'How dare they deny me the rank of master!' shouts Anakin. Apparently this is enough to become evil and suspicious of the Jedi. 'The Jedi are power hungry' says Palpatine. Then 'I must destroy them'. Then he lops of Mace Windu's arm and cries 'Oh no, what have I done?' He is traumatized for about...3 seconds and then vows eternal loyalty to Lord Sith. And all to save his wife. Apparently they are the perfect couple because they both deliver the same cheesy unemotional lines to each other. As one reviewer put it, they lust for each other, there is no genuine love.Also, it's hard to feel sympathy for Anakin who doesn't exhaust all his options before turning to the dark side. How about taking her to a doctor and watch every attempt to save her life fail before seeking the dark master. No! How about showing a little emotion after killing 50 kids with your light saber? No! All the Jedi's seem to be little pansies after being wiped out so easily.And the worst of all is having Padme die at the end of the movie. Despite being 100% healthy. She just lost the will to live because good IL' George just needed to get rid of her before the story ended. And what about the stupid idiotic lines of Anakin as the modern Dath Vader. It looked like it was ripped from Frankenstein.Overall, the action scenes and the special effects made this movie watchable. I wouldn't mind seeing more of them so long as the characters don't say anything.",5,2,4,26 May 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Beautifully written and executed... not quite as scary as thought
","I don't know why this ranks as one of the greatest horror films of all time, but it surely is one of the most thrilling suspense films put together in ages. There are enough twists and turns to make it interesting and Hannibal Lecter's (Anothony Hopkins) mind manipulation works wonders on the audience as well as that of Clarice Sterling (Jodie Foster). Just be sure to be fully awake when you watch this movie otherwise you, like me, might not understand the clues to the movie that makes it make sense.Hopefully, you also aren't afraid of realistic gore and violence because its everywhere. Just remember that its all an illusion anyway. I can't say that this is one of the best movies ever made because there have been so many spinoffs ever since this movie was made. The villain and prisoner helping to catch a bad guy has been done over and over numerous times.
Still its a great movie, one that I recommend to all.A",Null,0,0,5 October 2003
Space Jam," Succeeds at what its meant to be - a entertaining kids movie (possible spoilers)
","I don't see what all the bad press is about, this was simply meant to be a family movie and was done very decently. Okay, so it was targeted more towards kids but it still doesn't stop it from being a good movie. Michael Jordan finally puts all his acting experience he had with Bugs Bunny doing those Nike and Chevy commericials to work. The plot is preictable and the ending is too - guess who makes the game winning shot?. The animation is superb though and the overall storyline isn't bad - even though its not politically correct.",8,3,4,7 April 2003
X2: X-Men United," Yeah... I guess it was okay. Includes Spoilers
","So I've just finished watching this movie and all i have to say is that managed to cram an entirely large amount of information that took 25 years to develop into one film. The only major interesting part of the film was seeing Magento rip the iron out of the body guards blood stream and seeing if Professor Xavier would have the courage to kill all of us little people on earth. Glad i didn't feel any pain. Personally, I didn't really like the fight scene between Lady DeathStrike and Wolverine. In the comics and cartoon series, they were once lovers. But of course being this is the movie they just decided to kill her without her saying a word. The liquid Admantium thing was so lame, you knew from the screen shots that that somehow it was going to play a role in her demise. Filling her with admantium and just dying was lame. Rebecca Romijn (lettuce) Stamos makes yet another great cameo appearence as Mystique. This time she actually says and does stuff instead of becoming eye candy for the viewers. Good work. I didn't like the ending though, the fact that Jean Grey died because she was trying to save the X-men. The most hiliarious part was seeing her whisper good bye through Charles Xavier in a sexy tone to Cyclops before being wiped out. Will she return?. Is she dead?.Duuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh........  She'll be back for X-3 as Dark Pheonix, hopefully this time they'll do something interesting. As for Halle Berry, I hope she does come back to play Storm. It may not be fun having a lame character who doesn't get much screen time but I just can't think of anyone to replace her.I personally wonder what its like for all those grown adults to be playing guns and robbers in this whole mutant fanfare. Can you imagine how silly it must have looked in rehearsal without the special effects and makeup. It's a kindergarden for ageless.",Null,0,0,11 May 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Good but not great... Spoilers included.
","SPOILERSI had heard a lot about this movie and decided to give it a try. I personally thought it was a very innovative and creative movie for its time but it certainly didn't scare the pants off me at all. The acting in my opinion wasn't exactly great and the overall story was sub par at best. I do like the concept of a killer who wears his victims out by sleep deprivation and then terrorizes and kills them in their dreams. The ending was probably the best with Nancy being terrorized in the supposed 'good' ending - it simply shows that sometimes you just can't tell between a nightmare and real life. Or is the life you live now a nightmare, with dreamland being your only savior?. Interesting, don't you think?.4/5",Null,0,0,22 August 2003
Sin City," Best comic book movie ever!
","I am new to the world of Frank Miller and his work but I did read his Dark Night Return's book which I thought was extremely well written at the time. This movie literally blows away any comic book movie I've seen before both plot wise and artistically. Personally I'm sick of superheros that wear masks and fight some retard bad guy that also has some corny super power.Sin City is much more satisfying for me due to the fact that its based on a story of vengeance and payback where the enemy deserves to die and the audience roots when justice is delivered. There is a lot of violence and gore to this movie but the good thing is that it all fits in with the storyline and you don't get a feel that its overdone. The acting was great and the movie was ten times better than that of Sky Captain.So if you want to see a great action/ thriller than this is a must. But be sure to leave the kids at home. Never mind, I saw them in the audience anyway.",10,0,4,3 April 2005
