Despicable Me 2," A disappointment
","Sigh!I don't get to watch too many movies, and even fewer on the big screen. So after watching Despicable Me (the original) numerous times at home - and loving it to death, this movie was a big disappointment for me and my daughters at the movie theater. It's been hard for me to put a finger on exactly what was missing, but I think it is mostly the lack of clever, witty dialog that filled the first movie. There are many fun moments in this movie, but they are predominantly sight-gags and one-liners. And sadly, the space between those moments was just not too intriguing. FYI, my girls (10 and 7) were also underwhelmed - though my younger one asked to get it on DVD or iPad, so she could replay the few parts she really liked.I thought this sequel had a lot of potential - especially in the Lucy character, but most of that potential was just squandered. The villain is portrayed with a very stereotyped and non-PC caricature, and unlike Vector (the villain from the first movie), didn't seem to have any motive. The evil plot was actually kind of scary instead of being funny, and the characters seem to spend a lot of time doing things that were just not that interesting and saying things that were just not that funny.All in all, a real let-down for our once-in-a-blue-moon trip to the movie theater.",4,30,53,29 July 2013
Pride & Prejudice," Wonderful adaptation
","I must admit, I don't understand why there are so many scathing reviews. Are these just purists being petty? So what if Elizabeth's sleeves are wrong.I'm not a Jane Austen fanatic, but I am a fan. I've read all of her novels and certain ones like Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility on more than one occasion. I've also seen the 1995 BBC version.In fact, I had just finished re-reading P&P directly before seeing this movie for the first time (back when it came out) and I was impressed that a 2 hour movie could do justice to the novel and really incorporate all the important scenes. They did have to cut a few corners, but not much (Wickham is not fleshed out enough - but he isn't in the 6 hour BBC version either). A truly remarkable achievement. The acting is good and the cinematography gorgeous. This is the comfort food, go-to movie for my wife (who's also read all of Austen's novels and seen the BBC version).Unless you're a nit-picking purist, you'll love this movie.",10,3,5,8 November 2010
