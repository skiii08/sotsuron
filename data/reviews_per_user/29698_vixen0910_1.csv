The Expendables 2," Better than the First
",This movie was awesome!!! Almost everything I had hoped for. I only didn't like the fighting scene at the end between Van Dam and Stallone. Van Dam only got in like 3 or 4 hits. I don't think that was realistic. Van Dam did play a good bad guy. I was excited to see all the 'old men' get together in a movie. I swear Chuck Norris does not age. He didn't really fight but it was cool to see him in the movie. I like the way the 'old men' characters were described in the movie by old characters. I was very upset to see Jet Li leave at the beginning of the movie and they replace him with some Asian GIRL. All in all I did love and enjoyed the movie. I definitely recommend going to see it. And all the other Expendables were kicking ass. Especially Jason Stathom. He was on point!!!,9,2,5,22 August 2012
