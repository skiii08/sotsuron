Howl's Moving Castle," Opaque, Incoherent, Meaningless Drivel
","This should have been titled Dageurotype. It is nothing but a series of images, though even dageurotype was more than that. To make matters worse, many of the images seem to have come off the cutting room floor of Sen to Chihiro. I haven't read the book, but the derivative nature of the images makes it hard to believe this is really based on someone else's book.Derivative didn't we see Chihiro and Haku run through a field of flowers? Wait, Sofi and Hauru do it too.Didn't Haku turn into a snarling dragon and suffer multiple bloody wounds? Wait, Hauru turns into a snarling bird of prey and suffers multiple bloody wounds.Don't I remember a scene where Haku's scales fly off him one-at-atime as he turns from a dragon. Wait, Hauru's bird shows the same effect.Wasn't there some cute, strange little character following Sen around? Wait, now it's a dog.Wasn't there an obese bad witch and an obese pretty nice witch in Sen to Chihiro? Wait, now there's an obese bad witch who turns into an obese pretty nice witch.Weren't there blob men in Sen to Chihiro? Here they are again. These guys never stop working.The list goes on & on.Opaque & Incoherent So, what is up with this witch liking to chew on hearts? And, why was it Hauru ran off with her & then ran away? I mean, she's a hot ticket, but was it a one-night stand or what? NO indication. So, Sofi really wants to break her spell & the way to do it is to break the contract between Hauru & Calcifer. So, why does she spend NO time over the next hour trying to decipher the contract? And, why does she tell Calcifer that 'Suliman told me Hauru gave you something', when Suliman said nothing of the kind? Wassup wid dat? Who are these 2 countries? Why are they at war? Who cares? We're just supposed to be so disgusted at the bloodshed that we ignore the bloodless story. Where the heck did Markl come from? Does he need to be home for dinner? Is he one of the 'lost boys'?Amazingly enough, the ending is worse than the rest.",2,16,37,4 July 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Great success! I was going to vote '7'
","until I read all the narrow-minded PC bull from the usual haters. Do NOT believe them. For example, one hater calls it 'Cruel and exploitative' and points us to a salon.com article that digs into how much of it was staged versus impromptu. This hater claims (OK, lies) about the article he/she just pointed us to. Why would someone do that? Here is the article http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2006/11/10/guide_to_borat/ The hater says the article 'reveals almost none of the gags were staged'. Actually, it reveals that at least WERE staged. Hater calls 2 scenes 'memorably cruel' and 'vicious' ... the Jewish B&B and the southern dinner party. Read the salon.com article. In neither case do the, ahem, 'victims' agree with the words 'cruel' or 'vicious'. So much for victimization. So, I give the movie a 7 on its own and add 3 points for its ability to out the hypocrisy of the cult of victimization. All PC, all the time.",10,0,13,6 May 2007
Deja Vu," best time-travel movie of all time?????
","Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. B&T also had a more consistent and thought-provoking view of the recursivity conundrum of time-travel. Now this movie is a conundrum. I agree with most everything the headline comment (a 9 rating) by Max Million says. Aside from the time-travel hoariness, the movie is well-done and enjoyable. Denzel does not disappoint. I also agree with most everything said by the last few commenters, who downgrade it for the time-travel and plot holes. Full disclosure, except for Bill & Ted, I really really dislike most time-travel movies. When I rented this, I didn't know about the time-travel aspect. (Maybe I've got to get out more. Nah!) When I realized it was turning into a time-travel movie, I reflexively reached for the remote to turn it off. But, I didn't because I was enjoying it to that point. So, for those thinking of watching it ... go ahead, just forgive it the maybe-below-average time-travel difficulties. Look past that and it is enjoyable. Party on, dudes!",7,0,1,23 July 2007
Akira," Is your head hurting? An acting disaster protocol ...
","The truest words spoken in Akira are when Kaneda screams (Kaneda does nothing but scream) 'Where the hell am I friggin going?'. By that time this thing has gone off the deep end. I have to give it a few points for the fine animation and for having influenced other, future, better movies. But, beyond that, geeeeez. This thing consists of violence, screaming, violence, swearing, violence, some Blade Runneresque neighborhoods, violence, and more screaming. When the lead characters are punks with inferiority complexes who ride around trying to smack people on the head with lead pipes, well, who gives a ($*@$*#($!! It really does need some kind of theoretical physical framework, because all systems are definitely not nominal in Akira.",4,16,37,11 September 2007
The Prestige," Not in any way a 'Top 100' movie
","Too full of the current fashion: flash-backs, flash-forwards, twists, and turns. The main point of them in this case seems to be to confuse people. Well, guess what, I was confused, but that didn't stop me from figuring out the BIG SURPRISE that Borden had a twin about halfway thru the movie. here's an example of those giving it a '10': 'Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman give out powerful performances. I can imagine no other actors to portray these characters.' Whenever someone says that about actors in a movie, you know they cannot think outside the cranium, never mind outside the box. And here is more 'The film also features a solid performance of David Bowie, playing an expert in electricity.' Whoa. This film expert never even heard of Nikola Tesla. Hey film school dropout, he is a real person. Whether he built the first transporter/cloner/whatever, well, we'll leave you to think about that. What? Don't they offer 'Physics for Dumbies' in film school?",5,16,37,26 June 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," All in all, at least it is better than Sin City.
","Another one of those anointed films that people have to make junk up about to rationalize their obsession. Bottom line is: lots of people these days love to watch films that are about little more than CRUELTY ... slasher films, supposed psychological thrillers, and others. At the end of the day, they're just an excuse to sell tickets via showing cruelty. So, this film takes that path but adds a fairly good story and some good acting and some a strange interaction between a 20th century civil war and fairy tale darkness. Contrary to the opinions of some here, no those two worlds did not blend well. That is one of the fundamental problems with the film. We can spend hours finding ways the two worlds may intersect, ways the two themes speak to universal truths, but, hey, why don't you just go back to flippin burgers. In this film, they clash, not blend. Discord, not harmony.At least, unlike others who were disappointed, I didn't have 'unsurmountable expectations'. Even so, I was disappointed. I agree that it feels half-baked and the fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Contrary to the opinions of some here, the pale creature is not 'devastatingly creepy'. He is interesting. He is well done. He is in the film for about 2 minutes. In those 2 minutes, he does nothing really creepy.Another fundamental problem is that, other than the girl, nobody is really likable. You know, it would have helped if we could have liked the mother, at least. Or, if Mercedes wasn't so stupid that she didn't kill the Captain. Really. Who with half a brain says, 'You won't be the first pig I've gutted!' to someone lying helpless on the floor, and then turns around and runs away ... with little hope of escaping and no real idea that running away sooner really makes escape more likely. Just dumb writing. I won't bother with other holes.",3,12,27,10 June 2007
Lost in Translation," For people with a soul, not smart people
","OK, I gave it a 10. I spent a lot of time in Japan as a gaijin. I loved the soundtrack, which contains a few rarities that I just happen to love. So, if you've never spent time alone in Japan, you might say its only a 9. If you've never spent time alone in any place as foreign as Japan, give it a 8. If the music isn't for you, give it a 7. But, to put it down sarcastically as a movie for only 'smart people' is foolish. It is a movie for people with a soul. If you don't get it, you need to find a soul. What happens? Lots of things happen, and they do so without F/X or CGI. Imagine that. What is it about? Get a soul, then ask. One hint; when you find yourself alone in a very foreign place, say like Little Rock, in a place when everyone has preconceived notions about you, good & bad, just because of how you look, that really helps you figure out who you really are.I do agree with the criticism of the female lead as more whiny spoiled brat than neglected wife. Not to say her acting isn't fine, just weak writing in that regard.",10,3,5,14 May 2006
Spirited Away," This rating & reviews are too funny
","Hey. It IS a well-done piece of social commentary. This is Animal Farm for Japanese environmentalists. Saying this is a 'kid's movie' is like saying ANimal Farm is a kid's book. Well, maybe they could finish it, but they can't understand 2% of the intent.The issue: how can anyone who isn't Japanese or have a detailed knowledge of Japanese culture & mythology give this anything above a 5? Without that knowledge, it is impenetrable. I've lived in Japan, but except for the fact that my wife, Japanese with a degree from perhaps their #1 liberal arts college, could help me with reference's, I would've been scratching my head. People, without the background, who rate this highly are just jumping on the bandwagon. Go ahead, discuss Animal Farm without talking politics. Same thing.",6,21,47,24 November 2005
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Its a car-wash ladies & gentlemen.
","Laugh-out-loud, look-around-to-see-who-saw-what-you're-laughing-at FUNNY. I feel so optimistic. I was expecting a gender-bending Spinal Tap, but its more like a twisted Purple Rain fogging the windows of a Polish bathhouse. It even has a 'the-artist-formerly ...' joke but alas, not Prince's musical talent. Maybe, a philosophically serious Rocky Horror. So, its not absolute pleasure I can give myself over. Still, to be free, one must give up a little part of oneself & I know just the doctor to take it.Very high marks for the concept of the botched sex-change, pseudo-transsexual, glam rocker to explore the Greek (Aristopholes, I guess) theory on men & women being 2 parts of one whole, muskrat-love, etc, etc. Very creative concept. ALso, great acting, great sets, great costumes, etc. Take that Hollywood. Why don't you take the whole bag. Thats the very business we call show... and the jobs we call blow.I can't take the whole bag. The music isn't as good as Rocky Horror. some of it is really weak, but they clearly focused on telling the story via the lyrics, not writing memorable hits. 6 inches forward & 5 inches back.Not as funny as Spinal Tap. No Prince. So, no 10. Prince may be micromanaging but I love his work. And besides, Anne Murray was a Canadian working in the American idiom.I'm sure those who don't like it prefer blander, less complicated confections and a giant-sized sugardaddy named Luther. Either that, or they wanted music on par with Rocky Horror or Purple Rain. Well, Sugardaddy, Hansel needs some sugar in his bowl ... and the colored girls sing ...The Germans are a patient people and good things come to those who wait. Will you give them the apple? Have a nice salad.",8,1,3,11 July 2006
Big Fish," I guess 'feel good' is worth an extra 6 points
","And in a way that's OK. But really, 27% of people give this a 10?? Come on, if this is a 10, then what is Forrest Gump, a 20? Please, somebody who voted 10 tell me how this is a better movie than Forrest Gump. Please.The acting is great, esp A. Finney & J. Lange, as is Tim Burton's cinematography & the power-of-positive-thinking philosophy feels good. The idea that a son would dislike his father and not talk to him for 3 years just because he tells tall tales gets the whole thing off on a very bad foot, from which it never really recovers. But really, to vote a 10 for a movie that espouses the way to leave a legacy is to make stuff up, you would have to not only have voted for Bush & Cheney, you would have to believe their stuff.I won't bother explaining the story. The 10 voters do that much better.",2,6,17,24 March 2006
The Departed," THIS won an Oscar? Any Oscar?
","I wasn't surprised when it won. The 'oh, he/she has never won, so we've got to give it to he/she' has been VERY busy the last few years. Plus, I hadn't seen it. I was really looking forward to it. WOW!! This was bad in a number of ways, but mainly because this has to be the worst screenplay EVER to win any Oscar, never mind a best pic. How else was it bad? Casting Nicholson as a tough guy that would scare everyone else has always been a laugh. Nicholson is a little pisant. He wouldn't last a year in South Boston, never mind decades. Nicholson's games with hookers were pointless and just distracting. The woman shrink, whatever her name was, sleeping with both Damon and DiCaprio was ridiculous. Wahlberg (was that him? I hadn't known he was in the pic, and for a few minutes I thought Damon was playing two characters.), looked and sounded like a local village idiot in Charlestown. Truly, the entire police force, local, state and FBI couldn't have lit a 100 watt bulb. The idea that Nicholson's character wouldn't have fingered and killed DiCaprio's character quickly is also ridiculous. Let's see. Nicholson has, oh, a half-dozen henchmen, all of whom have been with him for YEARS, all of whom have KILLED for him. Then DiCaprio shows up. He is an EX-COP! Hicholson takes him in. About a year later, it becomes clear there is a rat in the group. Gee, who do we suspect? Now here is one that gets a little tricky. I noticed the guy told DiCaprio to go to #314 instead of #344. The guy noticed that DiCaprio still showed up at #344. Now, we aren't sure if that guy was an undercover cop or not. The TV said he was. Nicholson doubted it. If the guy wasn't a rat, why didn't he tell his cohorts that DiCaprio was, ahem, suspicious. Gee you think?Another reason it is so ridiculous he hadn't killed DiCaprio by then. When the TV fingers one of his guys as a rat, Nicholson won't believe it, though he knows there is one. This is like a 'which one doesn't belong in this group' game for a 2 year old, but Nicholson failed it!There were a few more crazy plot holes and foolish setups. It was hard to keep up with them. As for the almost everybody-gets-shot-in-the-head ending, don't get me started. There are too many inanities there to begin. At least Wahlberg's village idiot knows how to put on foot covers. Was that to hide the fact that he didn't know how to tie his shoes?All in all, I understand why MS got the Oscar. The direction and acting was pretty good. But, giving this a Best Pic or voting it anything over a 6 is ridiculous.",1,42,68,26 March 2007
War of the Worlds," just plain weak, lousy, lazy, etc.
","Just saw it on DVD. What the .....? People praise this? Someone says 'this is what it could be like if we were indeed invaded by extraterrestrials'? I sure hope so. I sure hope my family becomes unbreakable, my son runs onto a hillside that goes up in a conflagration, but he survives, I'm able to drive my minivan around for miles (Hours? who can tell?) unimpeded even though all other cars are dead on the road, I fall 100 feet to the ground in a steel cage & walk away fine, war machines will be prancing thru Boston but my in-laws' entire NEIGHBORHOOD in the Back Bay will suffer only from a lack of leaf raking ... well, maybe I don't hope so much for that last one. Of course, Cruise wasn't unscathed, his watch broke. But the guy next to him had a working camcorder, so why worry? And who was this woman he meets near the ferry and what was that supposed to add? So, the first half is about random people running in random directions. The 2nd half is about wondering when it will end. ps: the aliens died of embarrassment.",2,3,5,24 November 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Forest plays fat cannibal wearing kilt. Cool.
","Just kidding. But really, this is another one of those flicks that has (A) almost no likable characters and (B) plot snafus/ characters continually doing really dumb stuff. Now, I haven't read the book, and I do not know how much of this is actually true. But, 98% of Garrigan's actions are either (A) just plain stupid or (B) totally unbelievable. You tell me. Either way, that is a big hurdle for a fat guy in a kilt to leap. So, lets see. I go to Africa. I treat a guy for syphilis. I then proceed to sleep with the same women he sleeps with! Oh by the way, the guy is a psychopathic killer. What?!?!? How stupid is Garrigan supposed to be? As for plot snafus, I think the editing just stunk. For example, just after Garrigan gets it on with Kay, every runs around saying 'Amin wants everyone down by the lake ... Hurry up.' So, everyone runs to the lake & Amin is playing a tune, and ... nothing happens. Did I fall asleep? What was that? Did they edit out a scene and forget to edit out the one leading up to the one they edited out? That is not the only such instance, but why bother ... it is only a 4.",4,6,9,19 July 2007
Munich," Very well done, with only minor flaws
","I can almost forgive Spielberg for the waste of War of the Worlds. I would say the only flaws I see may be due to the source material. i don't know because I have not read the book. I know it is politically correct to feel bad about killing people, even if you'r'e an assassin, but hearing them whine about it all the time was pretty annoying. And the way Avner reacted to Israelis when it was over. Why would he be so upset with everyone? Why in the world would he accuse them of trying to kill him? I guess the point of the story is that if you go around killing people, and you didn't start out crazy, you'll go crazy. I guess, but that isn't exactly a universally significant insight. By the end, I got so tired of this aspect that I truly cannot even remember how it ended.",8,1,3,15 March 2007
Sin City," exactly what is wrong with modern society
","No redeeming feature or value other than style. The style is impressive. It is not especially unique. Other than that ... nothing. OK, lots of inane violence. OK, one or two funny lines. Yet, people, most people who bother to vote it seems, give it a 10. It brings to mind Natural Born Killers, but at least that had characters and character development and a point of view and some redeeming features.And generally, the best compliment they can give it is 'true to the comic'. Reminds me of the saying 'Garbage In, Garbage Out.'Do you people vote in elections too? Is that how we keep getting these presidents?",1,86,169,29 December 2005
