The Blair Witch Project," what's up with this flick?
","yeah, so it's shot with a camcorder and a 16mm (whatever that is) - how novel, but it certainly doesn't make for great or even good film-making in my books.  now don't get me wrong, i'm certainly no film-school graduate or new york times movie critic but i do have taste and sensibilities.  all my senses told me about this film was that the reason for my uneasiness and even nausea was attributable primarily to the terrors of that *!@#$ shaky camera rather than to those of any blair witch.  believe me, i forgot about this movie as soon as it was over.  but not to seem completely sour-assed, i will say that it was a marginally creepy film.  but, again, the keyword here is novelty.",2,0,1,22 August 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Stylistic opulence at the expense of heart and soul
","this film is first and foremost about style.  the director  pulls out all the stops (perhaps excessively) to make for a visually striking, but also highly contrived, movie experience. the story and characters take second place to coppola's masterful stylistic manipulations as director. the costumes and set pieces are gorgeous.   the film's gothic atmosphere is highly charged with dark eroticism and sensuality, most obviously manifest in the character of lucy, played with slutty mischievousness by sadie frost.  keanu reeves is rarely a good choice for any part and here he is particularly ill-cast.  winona ryder, as delicately luminous and porcelain-skinned as she may be, also fails to give her character any real edge or depth. in the case of both young actors their silly english accents only emphasize their shortcomings in their respective roles.  anthony hopkins takes his usual place by pompously posturing as the brilliant but creepy weirdo.  gary oldman in the key role, however, is marvelously convincing as the tormented yet magnetic count dracula.  his performance is genuinely good.  but even dracula is secondary to the real point of this film: the showcasing of coppola's prodigious skills as a stylist, which alone is reason enough to watch",7,0,1,16 July 2000
