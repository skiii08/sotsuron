The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Best Hunger Games So Far
","Although this installment of the final chapter of the Hunger Games movie did not entirely pick up where it left off and just gave an idea of what happened instead, I think this is by far the best of all the previous installment of the film. There were some dead moments and although I still can't get over the Big Brother scenes where serious moments would have to be captured on tape for the Capitol and other districts to watch, I still think, Jennifer's reputation in Hollywood helped pull more audience than before. Julianne Moore as Madam president is so beautiful she is distracting in a good way. The story on how a heroic heart of an ordinary girl with compassion to her fellowmen and how it inspires many to stand up against abuse of power and dictatorship is inspiring in itself. The effects were better than the previous ones, the characters are more engaged and the story just kept getting better. The cut towards the final installment of the film is a bit of a cliffhanger but was cut just right..",7,4,20,25 November 2014
The Maze Runner," Misleading Trailer Makes You Expect
","Gave it a 4 because the trailer presented a completely different idea than that of the actual story of the film. You would think in the trailer that the story would revolve around the maze and how there kids would find their way around it or surpass obstacles and stuff. But I felt like the story actually revolved around the camp where they were trapped and how they can find their way out through the maze only to find out they were part of some experiment to prepare them on a fight against some alien invasion of some sort. The story lacked direction in the plot. I think there has been too many insertion of unnecessary scened especially at end of the film where it felt like there were just squeezed in there together to make some sort of a lame twist. Oh, and the cliffhanger, ugh....",4,1,3,25 November 2014
Interstellar," The Mark Of A Whole New Understanding Of The Unknown
","This is one hell of a movie that will make mathematicians, physicists and scientists alike drop jaw. The whole idea about space-time continuum, law of singularity, multiple unverrses, time-travel and all that are put in to this one hell of a masterpiece. Although many might find the idea so alienating, I think the way the movie was shot and how these theories were presented in the film gives us all an idea of how complicated the realm of the unknown really is. If this movie has some scientific basis, then this marks a new dawn of science and its understanding in time-travel or let alone the human race. the breath-taking visuals that put to life the fabric of space and time was so simple yet so complicated. But in the back of a scientific mind, will say, 'hey this makes perfect sense' How the past and the future were made to tie together in the story is just astounding.Maybe we are not in the present right now, maybe this is the past, and a version of us is already taking advanced steps somewhere in the parallel universe. Maybe things that we really can not explain through science is actually something much more advanced that what we could possibly fathom. Or maybe presence of superior power exists beyond space and time. This movie will twist your mind in to thinking a lot of crazy stuff.How would the future of human race look like if we took a huge leap from the traditional scientific beliefs? Get a glimpse of it yourself and see this movie..",8,1,4,25 November 2014
Man of Steel," A Refreshing Reboot
","I have always been a fan of Superman since I was a kid. This reboot made me feel connected not only that it seems to somehow catch up with where the TV series 'smallville' left off in its final season, but on how the story of Clark Kent was tailored to somehow fit the scientific realm. How and why his powers came to be, what happened to his home planet before he was sent here to earth and how the Lois and Clark actually began. Although I gotta admit that I still crave for the Lana Lang moments that were hugely part of the Smallville Series.Henry Cavil made a perfect superman for me for he possess the qualities of that superhero we've always known. The touch of family and drama in the movie makes it more interesting and the come back of some veteran actors in the film such as Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Russell Crowe just satisfy the audiences' craving for new faces in the big screen yet this time it came like a blast in the past.The storyline is just carefully thought of and makes us believe this reboot of superman is the real story after all- no offense to our Original Christopher Reeve.",8,2,5,25 November 2014
