The New World," a great piece of art
","i rented this thinking it would be another one of those OK action-romance films that are kinda fun to watch, but its a lot more than that...its an amazing piece of art,the cinematography was amazing, i cant believe it didn't win that Oscar, the acting is good, especially the newcomer who plays pocahontas and so is colin farrell, and the rest of the cast, yes its kinda long and i guess i kinda understand why people think its a little boring, people who say that probably went to it expecting it to be non stop action, but it isn't, its art, and to weird for their stupid brains to grasp it might be historically incorrect or whatever but its still an amazing accomplishment, and maybe not for some people, but i loved it",9,2,5,13 June 2006
United 93," The Best Film of 2006!
","like i said its the best film of 2006, a true gem, worthy of remembrance for along time, and should most definitely win an Oscar......it was shot wonderfully,and cleverly, it makes you feel like you were there, and makes you uncomfortable, the actors are so good, it almost doesn't seem like their acting at all, it better win at least a couple Oscars, it is much better than the recent movie world trade center, which is total crap, the last 10-15 minutes are very difficult to watch, and almost everybody in the theater has tears in there eyes( i admit! so did i) when they overpower those worthless mother f***in terrorists is the hardest to watch, especially when the they show out the window and the plane gets closer and closer to the ground, and the it goes blank, they couldn't have done those few minutes better............i strongly recommend you see this and not the world trade center",9,1,3,12 August 2006
Barry Lyndon," Very Long, But Never Boring, A True Masterpiece
","another masterpiece from one of the greatest directors of all time, the one and only Stanley Kubrick(1928-1999), the first 20-30 of the minutes aren't that good, and i didn't think it would be that good, but it just got better and better and better, Ryan o'Neal is amazing as Barry Lyndon, and so are all the other actors, and even though Philip stone wasn't in it a whole lot i thought he was really good(hes also been two other Kubrick films the shinning and a clockwork orange), who i think is underrated, it was wonderfully filmed and written, it is pretty long but it is never at all boring, definitely one of my favorite movies ever, so if you haven't seen this, i strongly recommend you do",10,15,19,2 May 2006
The Shining," One Of The Greates Horror Movies Of All Time
","i think this is definitely one of the best horror movies of all time, thanks to Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence, which i think is one of the creepiest and best performance of all time, all the other acting is great too, except Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance isn't all that good, but shes pretty good in the famous scene where jack sticks is head through the door and says, 'here's johnny!', the kid Danny Torrance(Danny Lloyd) is also very good and Philip Stone, in is 3rd Kubrick movie, is very creepy as Delbert Grady who was once the caretaker, but went crazy and killed his wife and children and then himself, i also liked Joe Turkel as the bartender, the movie was very strange and creepy, one of the creepiest movies ever, and was also shot very well, jack ends up try to kill his own family but doesn't succeed and freezes to death, and then a strange ending, if you haven't seen this movie i recommend you do!!!!!!!!!",10,1,1,2 May 2006
City of God," The Best Movie I've Seen For A Long Time!
","like i said its definitely the best movie I've seen for awhile, and i have it on my top 100, its disturbing but still very very good.........it was shot very very good and cleverly, the acting was amazing!!! some of the best I've seen for along time, and every other thing was just as greatits about city of god, a housing project, that became one of the most dangerous places in Rio De Janeiro, that tells the story about a lot of different people, mostly very young, growing up in a very very violent place where children kill children, adults kill adults, children kill adults, and adults kill children.....very disturbing, but maybe not disturbing enough, but still very good, so go watch it now, if u don't mind a little blood",10,1,3,16 June 2006
The Number 23," Awful Film...
","First off, do not watch this film under any circumstances. Let me elaborate... Okay, well I just watched this. And I absolutely hated it.It sounded good when I heard about it, or at least fun to watch at a theater with friends or. But it wasn't even fun to watch, just annoying. Even the great cast: JimCarrey, Virginia Madsen, and John Noble, were terrible, or not right for the role. I really don't think this was the right role for Jim Carrey. I thought he was terrible. Plus it's far to serious. How could anyone take this seriously? The story and plot are at most times, really dumb, with stupid and silly twists, that are all over the place and messy. Messy film-making. The only really positive thing about this movie is the visual, it did have quite amazing visuals. But that's the problem with most movies these days(mainly horror films). There's far too much stylish movies, with no substance. And this movie is a shallow, empty, emotionless pit. There's no substance to it at all. Especially Carrey's performance, it was totally empty. It's weird that someone like Joel Schumacher could make such a bad film like this, when he's made pretty good films such as Falling Down, Phone Booth, and A Time To Kill. But then again he did make Batman & Robin(1997). I mean come on, batman with nipples, are you f ucking kidding me? He made batman less of a superhero and more of a faggot. Do not watch this film.",4,4,7,25 July 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Absolutely Terrible, Total $h!t
","like i said this movie is terrible, one of the worst of the year, and i cannot get why it has such a high rating.................................its predictable, horribly made, it probably could have been good if it was made by Bryan Singer like all the other x-men movies, but instead this total dumb @$$, who hasn't made one good movie in his pathetic, useless career, the acting is absolutely terrible, especially Berry, the only good thing about this movie is the effects and action, which is the only thing people pay attention to anymore, so as long as their is tons of action, blood, guts,good effects, its a master piece, if the rating ever goes over 6.5-7.0 i will trash my computer if you want tons of stupid action, full of cheesy tag lines, that i guess are supposed to be funny, go ahead and watch this movie, i don't even feel right calling it a movie",5,2,3,12 August 2006
Amadeus," another masterpiece from milos forman
","i just rented it, i thought it was awesome, tom hulce's performance was great, and so was f. murray abraham and one of my favorite actors, jeffrey jones, and so was the rest of the excellent cast, at time though f. murray overacted as an old man, but still good, like right after i watched it i put it on my top 101 favorite movie list, and i think it deserved all the academy awards and any other awards, because everything was amazing in the film, and if you haven't seen this movie, i strongly recommend you go out and rent it and watch, i don't now how anyone couldn't like it,unless they like hate classical music, which i don't really like, but loved the movie, its a masterpiece!!",8,2,4,2 April 2006
World Trade Center," It Was a Good Try
","like i said it was a good try from oliver stone, worthy of remembrance, but man this movie bites!! it was shot pretty well, and Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena were great, especially Pena, those two performances were the only real highlights of the movie, everybody else pretty much sucked(except for Maggie Gyllenhaal), it had some talent but it was all wasted, even Maria Bello wasn't all that great, and that kid, Anthony Piccininni, was absolutely terrible, he almost destroyed the whole movie, do us a favor a just stop your career here, be like a lawyer or doctor instead, I'm sure in time this movie will probably have like a 7.8 rating or some other bull $*!@ rating that it doesn't deserve, and maybe an Oscar, probably because what its about,9/11, and how important i guess it is, and that its about two very courageous men, but its pretty much is just a romance like every other dumb movie lately, if u wanna watch a movie about 9/11 thats good, watch united 93, which is probably the best film of the year!! this bull $h@! film is about a few cops who go in to rescue people from the twin towers, and some of the building collapses, killing them all but two, John McLoughlin(Cage) and William J. Jimeno(Pena), who are trapped under rubble for hours, but then are saved........................so it was a good try from Oliver Stone, but just really wasn't a good movie at all, so i don't recommend this movie",5,2,8,11 August 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A Strange But Great Movie
","its strange but very very very good.......................................a great movie, superbly acted, definitely Jim carrey's and Kate winslet'sbest performances ever!!and everybody else was good too, including, Elijah woods,Kirsten dunst,mark ruffalo........,with great story,great photography, and a great perspective of things, but if Jim carrey wasn't in this i probably wouldn't like it as much.................its about a couple who to take a procedure to erase all of their memories of each other and their relationship, but it isn't that simple...............great movie and if you like carrey go get it now, i strongly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,2,16 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Wait A Minute, So What Is So Good About This Movie
","this is a terrible movie and most definitely does not deserve a high rating or to be on the top 250 it has a lot of action and effects, but everything else is flawed, the acting is terrible, probably the worst of that year that I've seen, with a bunch of other flaws, this movie totally ruins, the whole trilogy, and is a huge huge huge disappointment to me, and i can not see what is so good about it............................................i do not recommend this movie at all, well only if you want to see tons of action, which is the only thing people go by anymore, if it has tons of action and great effects, its a masterpiece, i just don't get it!!!",5,1,3,12 August 2006
The Truman Show," One of My Favorites!!
","One of my favorites, just an excellent, thought provoking movie, with some flaws, but still good.........One of the first movies where Jim Carrey proves he can act, very well. Most of the cast is good, highlights include ed Harris as the Truman show creator and laura linney as Truman's wife. Visually stunning, and very very very fun to watch. Its a good thing Peter Weir directed it, because something like this takes a lot of creativity. It was also shot very well and the cameras barely move. The movie has some other flaws but is still a masterpiece, it doesn't matter what kind of movies you like, this one is fun to watch for everybody!!! Watch it!!!Two thumbs up!!",10,0,0,16 June 2006
Cube," Its Watchable
","its a very watchable movie, it has its moments, every once and awhile.....the story is great, and visually the movie is amazing, but the movie suffers from underdevelopment, the acting, which is OK but not that good, surprisingly Wayne Robson is good for this kind of role as the fugitive, and its just too stupid sometimes, and unbelievable but i guess overall its pretty good.....................................so if you are like a die hard science fiction fan or whatever i guess i would recommend this film...............................................but otherwise i don't now if i would recommend this for other people",7,0,2,16 June 2006
Cinderella Man," Not As Good As People Say It Is
","like i said its not as good as people say it is, it really isn't that good at all it has no originality, its just like every other movie about courageous stories, people, etc., the acting is okay, but most definitely nothing special, or Oscar-worthy, everything else is flawed, and it really just doesn't have anything good about it, except that it has a good message, and costumes, and it is fairly realistic to that time period, but otherwise it shouldn't have such a high rating or be on the top 250, its all just overrated garbage, which is what Ron Howard has been making lately, I've seen one too many of his bad movies, and i just don't think ill go to any of his other movies anymore i guess i recommend this though, because it is an OK family-like movie",6,6,11,14 August 2006
