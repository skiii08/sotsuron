The Avengers," Marvel Masterpiece
","Since that final clip with Nick Fury and Tony Stark in Iron Man, there was hope that maybe Marvel could really be doing an Avengers movie. 4 years later and 4 movies later (Iron Man 2, Hulk, Thor, Captain America) and we have Joss Wheddon's Avengers. What makes The Avengers so Engaging and Intriguing is the dialogue between the superheroes. Joss Wheddon should be awarded with an Oscar for the writing and directing of The Avengers. Everyone blended in so naturally and their back and fourth banter made for some good comedy. Everyone felt equal from Hawkeye to Hulk. It is so difficult to balance these personalities on screen and I don't think any other director besides Joss would've been able to pull it off the way he did.The Action scenes in the Avengers is as Epic as it gets. The last hour is like a marathon of awesomeness. Every action sequence in this movie was perfectly executed and each character had their significant moments. The cast was phenomenal as usual, but the show-stealer is definitely Mark Ruffalo. His portrayal of the incredible hulk was spot on. He was wildly entertaining and I couldn't help but cheer him on when he smashed sh!t. I think what made the Hulk work was because he was used sparingly.Lo-Ki as the villain was great. I felt he was developed a lot better here than in Thor. He was witty and had an evil aura about him especially when he was interacting with the 'mortals'.Never have I enjoyed a movie so much as the Avengers. The 2 hour plus runtime flew by easily and I was left wanting more once it ended. Once in a while a masterpiece of a film comes along, and after the hilarious closing scene after the credits, it was clear that this was Marvel's Masterpiece. Back to the Future and Terminator 2 have always been my go- to favourite movies. After this gem, I believe I can the Avengers to that list. 10/10",10,7,14,4 September 2012
Iron Man 2," A Great Sequel
","Iron Man caught me by surprise when It hit theatres back in 2008. Heading in I was thinking how the hell are they going to pull this off. Iron Man ended up being one of the best comic book movies ever, and it was only a matter of time for a sequel.Iron Man 2 is not as good as the original, but it is still a great film and should stand on it's own. We get to see a different side of Tony Stark as he spiral's out of control. We also get to see more interaction between himself and Nick Fury who made an appearance after the credits of the original.The action sequences in Iron Man 2 are spectacular and are a work of art. I was really impressed with the special effect's used especially in the final scenes. The camera angles during the flying sequences were handled very well. Robert Downy's portrayal of Tony Stark is one of a kind and awesome. I don't think anyone could've been able to play Tony Stark as well as Robert Downy which is impressive. Mickey Rourke had me convinced he was really Russian. His performance as Ivan Vanko was Great. He had a creepy vibe going for his character which really added to the plot. Scarlett Johansson blended in really well as 'the Black Widow'. Her fight scenes were pretty damn good. Sam Rockwell in my opinion stole the show. He was hilarious throughout as Tony Stark's rival 'Justin Hammer'. He had some good one liners and his interaction with Ivan were awkward and funny. I was hoping for Terence Howard to reprise his role as colonel Rhodes but Don Cheadle did a great job as a replacement, so that did not bother me as much.The original Iron Man will be hard to beat as the bar was set so high, however for a sequel, Iron Man 2 is a great follow up. I felt that the action sequences were a lot better compared to the original, It's weakness was the storyline and plot which at times seemed clustered and can confuse you. Still, those little problems did not hinder my enjoyment and I thought Iron Man 2 was solid followup to the original.7.0/10",7,2,4,4 September 2012
500 Days of Summer," Fresh... Beautiful piece of art
","This film was a breath of fresh air. Its your typical Boy meets Girl film but the way it is presented makes it beautiful.What i enjoyed was how time was plotted. It would Flash forward and back effortlessly. This idea could have easily backfired but it worked to perfection.My hat goes off to Joseph Gordon-Levitt. His portrayal of a 'fragile' Tom was right on the mark. Long gone are the days of 3rd Rock from the Sun (i did enjoy that show). You can really see his maturity in 500 Days Of Summer. Zooey as Summer also did an excellent job.There some laughs here and there, but it feels more like a Romantic/Drama/Comedy. It is probably one of the best if not the BEST Romantic Comedy/Drama to come out in 5 years. A breath of fresh air.8.5/10",8,1,5,17 December 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," Great Mix of Drama and Action
","My only negatives with Captain America were the annoying montage's. I understood the purpose behind them, but I thought one would be enough, not three.With that said, I thought Captain America was an Excellent movie. It balanced drama and action really well. I felt that the pacing of the story and how it evolved was really well done. It allowed me to invest into Steve Rogers a.k.a Captain America (Chris Evans). I loved the vulnerability he portrayed in the opening act's and how it remained consistent throughout.The cast was excellent and were phenomenal in their performances. Tommy Lee Jones who played The Colonel was exceptional and provided some good comic relief. Hayley Atwell did an fantastic job playing Peggy, who was Captain America's love interest. She portrayed her as an equal to Steve Rogers especially in the earlier moments. Joe Johnston (director) did a good job of setting up the future sequels and tying up some of the past tie's in the Avenger's universe. The integration of Tony Stark's (Ironman) father, Howard Stark, was handled perfectly. You can see the immediate resemblance between Tony and Howard, 'Like Father Like Son' I suppose. Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull was awesome. Wish i could've seen more of him on screen, and be more menacing. Still though, i felt that he delivered. The action sequences were incredible. I liked how they were spaced apart. It really added to the tension. The final action sequence's were spectacular. Apart from the montage's, Captain America was a great watch. There were a few flaws, but they are minor in the grand scheme. I was entertained and engaged for the majority of the film. Can not wait for the sequel.7.5/10",7,2,4,4 September 2012
2012," Enjoyable....
","2012 in my opinion was enjoyable. The first couple sequences however were not so. The acting in the first scenes were terrible and just over the top cheesy. Despite this though, they made up for it with a strong second half. I was very impressed with Woody Harrelson. He fitted in well with his role as the crazy guy who wanted to see the world end.The special effects in this film are spectacular. You can see where the budget went. Destruction is a signature in Emmerich's work and he is on his A game in '2012'. The explosions are just 'effing' awesome. My favorite scene has to be the Yellowstone Volcano eruption. The explosion was awesome, but what made this scene was Woody's facial expression. Very authentic.My gripes with the film is the cheesy dialogue and acting. There was a lack of depth in some of the characters. When it was time for them to die you didn't care that much. Also the length of the film. It was a little bit too long just under three hours.I did enjoy 2012 though. I recommend watching with an open mind. Its a good popcorn film.",6,1,2,17 December 2009
Avatar," Breathtaking!!!
","Just awesome. I was fortunate enough to see it in 3D, 'most of the 3D theaters were sold out'. Let me just say that Avatar is by far, hands down the best movie to come out this year and ranks in my top 15 of all time.The story is simple but effective. Cinematography is outstanding. But the special effects is just jaw dropping. The night sequences are breathtaking as the dark is illuminated by the glow of the leaves. Watching this in 3D, you cant help but look around and admire the landscape. The alien like insects, the purple sky, or how the ground lights up green when it vibrates (like m.j's Billie jean video).Avatar by far is the best movie out this year and one of the best this decade, and IS THE FUTURE of cinema. You have to see it to believe it. Its almost 3 hours long and it when it ends you would've felt it was short. I recommend seeing this in 3D to get the full experience. Either way, 2D or 3D, Avatar is Freaking Awesome.9.3/10",9,29,52,16 December 2009
Thor," Perfect blend of Fantasy and Action
","Of all the movies leading into the Avengers, Thor was perhaps the film i was least looking forward to. Whenever I think of Marvel's superheroes, I think of Spiderman, Fantastic 4, IronMan, Hulk etc. The last guy that comes to mind is Thor, who is 'the god of lightening'. After watching this film however, he's right up there. I enjoyed the blend of fantasy, Shakespearean folklore and modern action. Everything seemed to flow through easily. The transitions from the planet Asguard and Earth were seamless and very well done. The special effects were decent and not too overbearing. The buildup to the Avenger's movie is in full effect in Thor with regular appearances of Agent Coulson representing S.H.I.E.L.D. Thor was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Chris Hemsworth performance as Thor was great. He was a natural fit for the character and showed a great range of emotion. He can be menacing and funny in one scene. He can also be serious and mellow as well which is impressive. His interaction with Jane (Natalie Portman) seemed authentic which would've been difficult to do with the story behind Thor. All in all this movie kept me engaged and I bought into the Thor Mythology. I was entertained through out the film. There was a good balance of comedy/drama/action in Thor. Looking forward to the next phase in the next Thor movie.7.5/10",7,2,4,4 September 2012
Halloween," The epitome of Horror
","Halloween will always be my favourite horror movie. Don't know what it is that makes it so special, but everything just gel's together so perfectly from the plot to the haunting piano keys in the iconic theme to the emotionless mask of Michael Myers.The story is pretty straightforward, which is what makes it so frightening because it's relatable and is not outside of the realm of possibility. I can see myself reading about this in an article online about a boy stabbing his family to death after a night out trick or treating, spending the majority of his life in a mental institution, escaping and going back to finish off the job.The scene that haunted me when I first saw this film (8 Years Old) is where Michael obliterates the closet door and the light flickers on and off while Laurie screams for her life and tries to fight her brother off with whatever she could find, and why????? Because I had the exact same looking closet in my bedroom at the time and I could see myself in Lauries situation. And that's where the horror lies. It's being able to relate to the characters and putting yourself in their shoes. You feel for Laurie, and you want her to live, you care about what will happen to her because your invested in the character thats portrayed. So many horror films of today rely on cheap jump scares and gore, I wish horror directors/writers would look and study Carpenter's Halloween.What tie's all the horror together is the music. When I first heard the Halloween theme, It stuck in my head for weeks and I slept with the light on with talk-back radio turned up. The key strokes are simple, its only 4 notes, but it does the job, and it sums up everything about this film. It's simplicity is what makes it a terrifying thrill ride. Halloween came out at the perfect time, 1978, it's 2015 and still stands the test of time.",10,0,1,9 April 2015
Back to the Future," Timeless Classic
","Back To The Future is perhaps my favorite movie of all time. When i first saw Back To The Future i was 8 years old. Since then I've been fascinated with the possibilities in time travel (worm hole anyone), Delorean's, Pine Trees, and of cause the 50s culture.What i love about Back To The Future is the whole vibe. Its first Sci Fi/Family/ then Comedy/Action/. It has everything.The story is a gem. Marty (Michael J Fox) is stuck in the year 1955 after escaping from a group of terrorists who were out for revenge after their plutonium had been stolen by Doctor Emmett Brown for his new invention, a time machine. Marty in 1955, is without plutonium and has to figure out how to get back. Fortunately for him, he 'knows' his history and devises a plan with the doc from 1955 to get back to 1985. Oh, did i mention his parents. That is another story in itself.It doesn't get anymore original than that. The writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale did an incredible job. This is one of few films i can never get tired of watching. If you haven't seen it, then something is seriously wrong with you. Punch yourself in the face for not doing so.10/10.",10,4,5,17 December 2009
