Alien 3," Can't state this emphatically enough... see the Special Edition
","The producers of Alien3 should be ashamed of themselves and they owe David Fincher a serious apology and compensation. They caused so much hassle and stuck their noses in places they didn't belong that the theatrical release(TR) of Alien3 was watered down compared to the masterpiece David Fincher produced in the Special Edition(SE). The theatrical version deserves the lowish rating it has received, but the Director's cut is outstanding and in my opinion is the best of all the Alien movies in the franchise to date!!! In this day and age of much longer movies, it doesn't make sense to see in hindsight the editorial debauchery David Fincher's Alien3 was witness too. The TR was bad. Large sections of the plot were stripped, they replaced the pivotal alien host, and in general the sections that set the scene were all missing. One Simple and essential must... SEE THE SPECIAL EDITION !!!!The characters are disturbingly great and portray a very credible motley band of backwater planet prisoners. Charles Dance is brilliant but unfortunately isn't on screen for as long as I wished. Maybe that in itself is a testament to the brilliance and another reason why some people scored Alien3 lowly- their sensibilities were hurt with a fantastic character killed quickly!!. Charles Dutton is a mean and believable 'top dog' and the contribution of the reliable Pete Postlethwaite was a treat. The interaction between prisoners, authorities and visitors was always evident and very well handled. Alien3 further highlighted the expendability of human life for corporate greed.The Alien is one nasty critter. Different to the other Alien movies, the camera angles of the alien's sight and movement are well executed. It is clear the creators wished to return to that claustrophobic and technological defunct world of the first Alien movie, and while it is very different, I believe it worked extremely well.Alien3 has an incredibly beautiful and stirring musical score. It is haunting in parts and from all the 'Alien' movies, I believe most people would have this tune in their head. In the scheme of the Alien saga, I believe Alien3 -Special Edition to be the best. Without giving away serious spoilers, the SE reinstates massive sections that transcend Alien3 from a lowly rated movie to a thoroughly deserved masterpiece. It is a pity David Fincher wasn't more experienced and time under his belt to tell and force the producers to 'My way or the highway'.SPECIAL EDITION ONLY TO BE SEEN!!!!!!",9,50,78,21 January 2006
Minority Report," In our not too distant future, most of this could be real...
","This would have to be one of the most under-rated movies around. I love the premise and execution. Love the spiders, sick-sticks, all the vehicles, the character interactions etc The setting looked actually all too real and a distinct possibility if technology was there. I know some people have issues with Tom Cruise, but I think he was awesome in this movie. Special Kudos to the doctor (quack quack).... can you imagine biting into that sandwich and drinking that milk? how many of you thought or shouted 'Ewwww... no no!' Overall a fine and realistic Sc-fi that with a little push in modern technology, could be our future.",9,0,0,8 February 2013
Alien: Resurrection," Oh dear... what a mess !!!
","Budget constraints were a major issue at the beginning, throughout and in post-production- and it shows. As an avid admirer of the Alien saga, I am thoroughly disappointed with Alien4. And there are two major reasons; one they did a very poor effort in explaining Ripley's presence and Sigourney Weaver struggled to promote credibility to the resurrection. And two, and most importantly, the image, the sound and presence of the 'alien' was so removed from the past three movies it was atrocious.The general idea of how hosts for the queen were obtained were interesting as was the 'biological weapon' angle. Apart from that I could almost weep when comparing this trash to the first three. 6/10 in hindsight is extremely generous and is more to do with the love of the franchise than any true indication of this movie's worth.The last half of this movie is so bad I am embarrassed for the producers. The new alien is terrible and diminishes the power and chill of the alien. The supposed claustrophobic feel they were looking for was not realised, the aliens seemed pathetic in their tenacity to destroy human life and was opposite to what was established.The producers tried to be too clever and ended up not being clever enough.",6,61,100,21 January 2006
The Fifth Element," A Big-bada-boom of a movie -- Green?
","This movie is so funky on so many levels. I absolutely love Luc Besson's work. The setting is fabulous with the nuances taken for granted in that day and age and are a brilliant eclectic mix of past, present and future; The vehicles, fashion, McDonald's, Military, Opera etc etc Milla Jovovich was sublime, there is no superlatives that are adequate to describe her performance. She Brought the absolutely adorable character of Leeloo to life.Similarly Bruce Willis was excellent with all his usual mannerisms and quirky attitudes. Gary Oldman just hit Zorg on the head and finally kudos to Chris Tucker, he was just hilariously brilliant - 'Green?' With a funky industrial soundtrack the Fifth Element is a fast paced and genuinely good fun movie.Oh.... and he we go for the fans; Leeloominaï Lekatariba Lamina-Tchaï Ekbat De Sebat :)",9,3,6,11 February 2013
Alien," The benchmark of not only a sci-fi horror, but any movie... period.
","Even after 25 years plus of other movies of this genre being made, Alien does not feel dated. That in itself for sci-fi is an amazing achievement. There are many examples of aliens in movies, and many more of horror and sci-fi. However very few, if any, have amalgamated all successfully and I doubt any would stand the test of time the way Alien has.The cast is phenomenal and there is no weak link. Each giving an optimal performance that leaves the audience believing them, feeling for them and relating to them. Obviously Sigourney Weaver shines as Ripley, but it would be unfair to single her out as all were impeccable.The level of technology was believable for a deep-space cargo vessel. It is refreshing to see a piece of junk flying patched up with sticky tape and not let the technology star. It actually lent to character development and add to the overall atmosphere of commercial miners in way over their head, in a place they are not supposed to be, in a situation they are not trained or prepared for. It was all very human and so credible.The storyline is so simple and Ridley Scott does not try to over complicate aspects of the plot. Instead he concentrates on wringing out atmosphere from every shot whether it is establishing character quirks or the suspense of terror. In my opinion Alien would have to be in the top two Scott's projects to date.The evolution and cycle of the alien itself is so terrifying it caused me nightmares growing up. Its anatomy, birthing and invincibility coupled with its supreme efficiency in killing is terrifying. It truly is one of the (if not THE) most excellent monster/aliens ever to grace the screen. In this day and age 25 plus years later, the 'Alien' is still nastier than any vampire, werewolf, extra-terrestrial, monster or villain that has come after.As part of the 'Alien' franchise, this first installment sets the scene perfectly better than any other saga. Alien is not the first of an never-ending straw grasping 'sequals' but the first part of an continuing story (ergo Lord of the Rings 1-3). Alien set the benchmark for sci-fi horror and in 25 years since its first release, it continues to be the example of how not only aliens, horror and sci-fi are to be depicted, but how a movie and story is to be produced.",9,2,5,21 January 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A darker offering but still as magical
","I have to admit that when I first saw the PoA, I didn't receive it as warmly as the previous two outings. However after viewing PoA again at the cinema and subsequently on DVD, I tend to believe it virtually as well done as Chamber of Secrets and hence slightly less than Philosopher's Stone. There are still the little tricks and quirks that make it 'Harry Potter' and all characters returning are great... except one. It was with great sorrow I heard the passing of Richard Harris and therefore I tried to look with respect and allow that Dumbledore is replaced by Michael Gambon and give him the benefit of the doubt. However the shoes of Richard Harris are too big for him to fill. The majesty of Dumbledore is not the same and regardless of good intentions, it detracts from the movie.But the story is interesting and engaging, though sometimes had to be explained to a younger audience. The special effects are fantastic. The kids are growing up and a lot of the silliness is disappearing, but then again (apart from the constant Radcliffe cheesy smiles) was that silliness part of the magical innocence? PoA is another good solid episode for the Harry Potter empire. And I still find it refreshing to escape the Americanised offerings that is usually the norm.",7,2,3,21 January 2006
Aliens," How a follow up movie should be done !!
","Aliens highlights and perfectly illustrates the arrogance of man's (and especially the American) attitude and supposition of superiority over all things. It also highlights the despicable lengths that corporations will stoop too to generate money. Maybe thats a cynical view but none the less it is true.The movie itself is fabulous. Gone is the rackety bucket of the Nostromo and in its place is the next evolutionary step what is expected 50 plus years later. However the technology is not overbearing and is entirely plausible for soldiers. The ships look fantastic, the weapons are awesome and I am still waiting for the 'Loader' as a Christmas present.The cast is excellent. Ever since Terminator, I have been a massive Michael Biehn fan and he didn't fail to deliver. Bill Paxton's Hudson is an instant classic and he is responsible for some of the most truly memorable lines in the movie. The human villain in Aliens plays his role so well, I was actually guilty of not liking the actor for years because I couldn't overcome his absolute credible portrayal of a man consumed with loyalty to his corporations avarice.Of all the Alien franchise movies, Sigourney Weaver puts in her best performance. You feel her xenophobia and believe the outright terror she feels. The solo preparation of her ride down the elevator is some of the best acting I have ever witnessed. The interaction between characters is surprisingly in-depth and varied to say Aliens is primarily a sci-fi action movie; true camaraderie, distrust, blossom of love, deep respect, intense dislike and more are examined in and unfolded in a totally believable and well executed manner. I also loved the mix of male and female in equal risk taking/responsibility roles and I love the fact the 'true' equality is not rammed down the audience's throat.We get to see more of the 'alien' in this outing but realistically it's more quick edited shots. However the mother of all aliens makes her appearance and she is phenomenal. If you haven't seen Aliens, the first time you see her, you will be awestruck.The major difference between Alien and Aliens is the way the horror and thrill is extracted from the audience. Alien is very claustrophobic in its suspense and setting and is so successful. Aliens on the other hand has some elements of that claustrophobia, however the pace is higher and the audience is swept along with multiple jumps, startles, and action scenes all to a brilliant and most befitting musical score.Aliens is a must see cult classic, and like all the movies in the Alien saga, the Director's cut is the version that is essential to view. A large majority of Alien saga fans rate this movie the best, it is certainly close.",9,5,6,21 January 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Better than most critics say, no where near as good as a fan's expectations!!
","Contrary to public opinion, I rather enjoyed AvP. Sure I believe it could have been better if it stuck closer to the book AvP:Prey, but it wasn't that bad.I must admit having yet again a female as the all conquering hero and survivor is getting rather tedious. Don't get me wrong, I think Sanaa Lathan does a great and credible job of a person in her position and I love Ripley and especially the equality displayed in Aliens, it's just getting old hat.I believe the history of four past Alien movies, two Predator movies, books, comics and the mouthwatering potential AvP stirred, it was hard for any movie to live up to that hype. Yet some of the action scenes in AvP is some of the greatest, liveliest, and most rewound and repeated scenes of ANY of the above bulk of the Alien and/or Predator franchise. I actually loved seeing the clash of these two titans, I loved how they re-established the way an alien is supposed to be; how perfectly ruthless, destructive and powerful they are. I thought it was terrific how they showed the trainee Predators on the hunt and their inexperience. And I believe the fights captured all this.I was disappointed in Bishop's role. He did seem in it for the pay cheque and AvP never firmly and concretely stated the link of Bishop, his company (Weyland Industries) and the preceding four movies.Overall I was happy to see the alien drone returned to its nasty and true H.R. Giger adaptation, and the Alien Queen is magnificent and accurately depicts her near unlimited power, strength and terror instilling awe. The predator whilst not Kevin Hall was fine for the most part. No other Alien/Predator franchise movie captures the raw power of these titans and in a brilliant manner than what AvP does... hence I fail to agree with other critics.Yes I believe AvP could have been better. The script could have had more depth, the characters more involved and fleshed out. But overall AvP, while not as good as the first three Alien movies and the first Predator movie, is a very good and worthy addition to the franchise.",8,3,5,21 January 2006
Batman Begins," Why is this Batman Production so popular?!?!
","After so much publicity I finally got around to watching Batman Begins (BB) and I am in two minds how to rate it. I am still not totally clear on final judgment, though I have seen it 4 times in my overly decadent digital home cinema so judgment is not for want of viewing.BB is definitely different to other projects bearing its name, but better? Well different. I can understand the franchise wishing to change their tact from the total trash of 'Batman and Robin', and the throes of embarrassing pathetic-ness it had become. They have re-packaged the franchise into a story that had previously not been told. It is obvious they have worked hard to try and bring Batman into the 21st century along with credibility of big budget and big names. But there is something gnawing at me that it is not very successful.The main problem I have is with the marketing machine. As was 'Hulk', BB is marketed to late teens and above with concepts of deeper emotional concepts and adult themes... yet, the retail stores shamelessly promoted the hype of all things Batman for children - and young ones to boot with BB pajamas, school stationery etc. I find it inherently dishonest for what is essentially adult based movies to manipulate the public using children. It is not so far fetched to envisage say 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TSM)' being promoted obviously with adults in mind but selling TSM toy chainsaws, pajamas and school gear to manipulate the public to make dollars.I understand that BB is supposed to be Gothic and dark, but at times its too dark. The fight scenes whilst having promise are edited so poorly, and coupled with the darkness, its a mess. Its alright, but I personally can not see how BB garnered the support and rating it has.Credibility for the project seems to be due to the impressive established actors that were roped in; Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer... and to a lesser extent Ken Watanabe off the back of 'The Last Samurai' and Katie Holmes thanks to Tom Cruise's syrupy public exaltations. But I didn't like Christian Bale's performance. He seemed to be dull and struggle in the company of the 'established actors'. Then again the screenplay wasn't the greatest ever and not strong enough to effectively utilise the talent. Michael Caine seemed miscast; Gary Oldman was bland and Gordon was portrayed too weak at times; Morgan Freeman was excellent but had little to do; Rutger Hauer along with Liam Neeson were cast in what seemed weird roles...Who was the true bad guy? Old formulas dictate that the climactic scenes pin the hero against the villain. Therefore, is Rutger Hauer; the corporate executive, the real bad dude, or is Liam Neeson? The League of Shadows which purportedly fights criminals... the essence of Batman's persona... are the bad guys ... rather ironic. It is so obvious that the 'Leagues' final actions are morally bad, but I felt that BB spent a lot of time in the final scenes ensuring that we see Rutger Hauer get his comeuppance when to be honest, I didn't really see they had established him as a credible villain. I mean we first see him when Bruce is young and he ensures the Wayne empire will flourish until Bruce's majority, which he does. Sure he acts condescending at times with 'too complicated for you' attitude, and his desire to progress the company's interests in areas which while far from illegal, were not to the original edicts of the founding Waynes. Yes he did fire Fox... but was it established that he was in bed with the League? And was he as bad or worse than the league? Liam Nelson did not portray the bad guy effectively, he was too good and not nearly nasty enough to warrant the leader of an ancient cruel judicial sect. The training of Bruce was established within a coven that fights for justice yet their brand of justice is highlighted beyond the bounds of morally right.. yet no one can see the blatant contradiction. The League itself seemed so small to be ineffectual for all the bragging of past deeds supposedly attributed to them.. it just didn't make a lot of logical sense.Taking into consideration what I have stated above, I can not in good conscience rate this movie anywhere near the trend of 8/10. I am rationalising my multiple viewings down to morbid curiosity and willingness to find answers that gnawed at me from in previous viewings. I felt BB was incomplete, half-baked and rushed to be released. It just seemed to be missing that final polish you come to expect from a large budget, star filled movie. I rate BB 5/10.",5,2,5,26 January 2006
Hero," Magnificent Cinematographyat its best... Storyline at its VERY worst.
","Well I'll be definitely bucking the popular trend for this film. For me on the whole I was VERY disappointed. The storyline(s) is extremely disjointed and confusing. It had a nice overall message of integrity, but to be honest I was so frustrated with the disjointedness of the movie it over-rode any fondness I had for it. The simple concept of the movie was dragged on and on to the point it lost its cohesiveness.Yes there is one saving grace; the cinematography is so outstanding, I have to think very hard to find another movie to rival it. The location is magnificent and the use of colour is magic. However the use of the colour tended to exaggerate the obvious disjointedness of the story(s).Jet Li was terrible. He seemed to never put any real effort into his role. He was like a stone most of the time from his introduction to... well the end.The shifts of stories was so bad I wouldn't even rate it a 1. But the saving, and only saving grace is that its a tremendously beautiful movie - eye candy that is!! And that, and only that, is what takes it from zero to a rating of 3.",3,7,14,8 June 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Rocky Five and death knell of the Harry Potter Franchise
","I haven't read the books and maybe Order of the Phoenix (OOTP) is an accurate telling of the book. But for me, I have lost all affection for the Harry Potter franchise. OOTP is too dark, too complicated and has lost the magic that endeared me to the blockbusting phenomena that the first two Harry Potter's instilled.I understand that the saga must advance and Harry and Ron et al must evolve as they age, but the look, feel and sound of OOTP bears little resemblance to the first two (and even the third). The story for me is so disjointed from the fourth and the glaring anomalies and pure stupid plot holes are unforgivable. There's nothing really new to delight, the pacing is slow and laborious and the characters become annoying and wooden.I have said this before in previous Harry Potter reviews, but Gambon's portrayal is terrible, and I find myself constantly mourning Richard Harris' passing. I just do not like Gambon's work in the franchise. He has ruined all credibility of the all powerful but controlled Headmaster. But his performance aside, I feel all the actors seemed to be bored and no one stood out- with the exception of Imelda Staunton's portrayal of Dolores Umbridge. I seriously disliked Umbridge, and we are supposed to, but I felt no joy in her demise, no one stepped up to the plate. Ron Weasley and Granger were token appearances, Radcliffe's performance was wooden and amateurish, and Gary Oldman, and especially Maggie Smith and Emma Thomson, had little to do. Voldermort's appearance was nothing special and the supposed highlights of the movie was at best a yawn fest.I do not like this movie and have no interest in further installments in the franchise. My eleven year old son (who has not read the books) was left scratching his head saying it was too complicated, he didn't understand parts, and it had lost it's magic... I couldn't agree more.",2,1,2,5 December 2007
Avatar," The Benchmark of future Sci-Fi movies...
","This movie is stunning. Not into the Gaia type thing, but the clash of cultures highlighting the obvious pathetic human existence of money grabbing at the expense of all else.Personally there is little in this movie that I find fault with. It draws you in so you want to be Jake in his avatar, you want to fly those beasts, and you cheer when the humans get their comeuppance :) I love the scenes of the females standing over the male in a protective stance.... something usually role-reversed. I found it natural, refreshing, and I whole-heartedly agreed with that equality.I saw it at the movies a few times in both 3D and standard, and both were fantastic. It was the first Blu-ray movie I bought and is magnificently vibrant through the Oppo, Denon, and Plasma screen.10/10 all the way, and I don't rate many movies that high!",10,2,5,6 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A return to magical innocence???
","Harry Potter seems to highlight what today's society is missing; the age of magical innocence, the pure abandonment of that essence of childhood. In this day and age of computer games and quick fix takeaway electronic happiness and incessant CGI violence, it's brilliant to see the world excited by story telling and the simple things. It reminds me of years ago as a child reading volumes of Roald Dahl's compositions and hanging out to read the next chapter of 'Danny the Champion of the World'. Harry Potter has engaged the world back into that innocence, even if it is for a two hour movie.The Philosopher's Stone is majestic, bold and outrageously expansive... and I want more. I took my son to a packed cinema and we were both entranced with the.. well.. magic of the package. The awesome Harry Potter theme and musical score, meeting of the main characters, hunting for school items, the train ride, the first look of Hogwarts... It is all magical. The casting of adults are perfect. Richard Harris typifies what a respected all powerful all knowing headmaster should encompass, all the professors are brilliant and Snape could be played by no one else except Alan Rickman.The 'magic' of the surroundings, the little gadgets and seemingly insignificant details are lovely. To be honest, the whole production smacks of that professional quality that is European/British and it was refreshing to be free from the American drawl and plentiful explosions and swearing.Make no mistake, this is a child's movie. But one that transcends through time and makes a cynical crestfallen adult smile and feel like a child again. Sure you have to ignore the sometime sugary scenes and I just looked at my son's beaming face... Harry Potter works.",8,4,9,21 January 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Lacking that bit of magic !!
","The Harry Potter phenomenon has become an entity unto itself. Mention Harry Potter, and its met with overwhelming ad orations, excitement and a fervor not unlike football fanatics. The marketing machine has everything Harry Potter and the general atmosphere of the franchise is one of infallibility and automatic hit before release...I wish it was so. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of Harry Potter and its air of childhood innocence and.. well... magic. However, the Goblet of Fire has lost a lot of what made it Magic.Gone is that trademark booming and lovable Harry Potter 'theme' that usually opened the movie.. that music itself IS Harry Potter and is as recognisable as melodies from Star Wars, Indana Jones and Star Trek. Gone is the next step in evolution of Harry's Foster-parents... Harry was just where he was. Very few nice little treats of pointless excitement - ie the chocolate frog, all flavoured jellybeans, the fun of practicing new spells.. all gone. Even the continual grin of Radcliffe has disappeared, and when he did try to do it on the bridge, it looked forced and out of place.What also is gone is the noble persona of Dumbledore. Once a character so eloquently played by Richard Harris, he was the epitome of what a respected, all knowing, and controlled Headmaster.. and all powerful one at that has come to resemble. In the Third we had to get used to Gambon and understand the differences, but now he's a failure. Lack of the same poise, he's now another character no more or less powerful. He's bumbling and has lost that dignity.The rivalry of Draco Malfoy also mostly non-existent with a token showing of him in the movie, which in the scheme of things WAS token and pointless.Snape lost his edge though the reference to his past was interesting.The overall continuity was disappointing and the promise was not delivered. They built up the World Cup then let us down with not even a match shown or the possibility of Harry's involvement as THE Seeker. Krum was a bore, the build up of the Tri-Wizard Cup and its terrors wasn't even close to being realised.The whole move lacked the grandiose of the first two movies and is even way behind the third. It no longer had that fairy tale like feel, and to me was 'just another sequel'. And I am VERY disappointed.What it successfully did do however better than other past Harry Potter movies was shout for a sequel. I for one can only hope that it re-establishes that magic.I personally have chosen to read the books AFTER seeing the movies. Therefore I am finding myself looking forward to reading Goblet of Fire as I envisage it FAR superior to the silver screen version (I hope!!). I sincerely hope that the Harry Potter franchise doesn't fall from the special and unique pedestal it now sits on, to the depths of mediocrity - or heaven forbid, like a Rocky 5, Rambo 3, Batman and Robin, etc - 'We should have stopped at two!!!'",5,5,9,26 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," That bit of magic returns
","The second installment seems to carry on where the first left off. All previous characters return and then some!! The grandiose majesty of Harry Potter continues with new tricks, new delights and little treats that can be taken for granted. At times I find the Harry Potter world has so many wonderful things happening at the same time that you tend to overlook the smaller things (ergos the Weasley's residence and the great Hall) The Chamber of Secrets is a darker tail but is well within the tolerances of most children's ability to handle. The creatures are excellent, the overall story is easy enough to follow, though some aspects have to be explained to younger children.What does get annoying is that constant overused Daniel Radcliffe cheesy smile. It wears on the sensibilities after a while like sharp finger nails scraping down a blackboard. Overall though, Chamber of Secrets is a solid good natured magical movie only slighter less pleasing than the first.",7,7,7,21 January 2006
War of the Worlds," An expensive B-Grade movie relying on big names and the franchise to make it money.
","I really enjoyed the last collaboration between Spielberg and Cruise in Minority Report. Therefore I waited with baited breath for this highly touted blockbuster. I was left somewhat disappointed. Being very familiar with all versions of 'War of the Worlds'(WOTW) could possibly be a hindrance to the enjoyment...On the whole the movie is very slow with intermittent spurts of excellent special effects. Spielberg has tried to bring a totally human side to the story told from the perspective of a irresponsible separated father (Cruise). However, I found the interplay of human emotions amidst the Invasion very superficial and at times downright frustrating. What was achieved so brilliantly in Signs, was a huge failure in WOTW It begins slowly setting the stage with introducing Cruise's character and his irresponsibility as a father. You wonder why he allows his ex-wife and partner carte blanch through his house without a barely audible whisper of dissent. His kids are spoiled, uncontrollable and devoid of any respect for their father. However when the 'storm' approaches Spielberg treats the audience to a successful degree of thrill and suspense. When you see the tripod and its actions for the first time it fulfills the suspense.... then things go downhill badly.You feel like screaming at the kids to shut up, and the story degenerates into bickering. Meanwhile you don't see much action of the tripods just the resultant chaos. The ferry scene so reminiscent of the soundtrack was an absolute letdown as there is no cheer and partial hope of a 'Thunderchild'. In fact the scenes were chaotically done to the point of it not really making a lot of sense.The whole scene on top of the hill between Cruise and his son was so pathetic its best left unsaid.Tim Robbins acted superbly as the token 'artillery man' but his character was written so incredibly annoying, coupled with the girls incessant stupidity it became a test of patience to sit through the movie.All through this we see very little of the tripods though we do get a glimpse of the actual aliens and they seem to be stolen directly from the set of ID4.The ending is atrocious, corny and unbelievable. In fact we as an audience have to suspend belief to logic in quite a few areas. I for one was glad when the movie finished. This is by far Spielberg's worst movie and it will only make money on his, Cruise and the WOTW franchise name.",4,67,119,1 July 2005
