The Blair Witch Project," Raving louder than you can stand it
","This movie snuck up on most of the United States, as well as me. I thought for just one day, it was real, after seeing the 'other' mockumentary on the sci-fi channel. I watched it as though I felt it was real, and felt like this was a true story. The camera effects only added to the urgency the characters felt to get away. 'Hungry, cold and hunted' will always ring in my head, and hearing Mike scream Josh's name will wake me in my sleep. If you watch it with an open mind and no expectations, you will immensely enjoy this film. It's not a rip-off, it's what would have happened. Please don't let them make a sequel, this film has the power to stand on its own and has now become my new favorite film.",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
