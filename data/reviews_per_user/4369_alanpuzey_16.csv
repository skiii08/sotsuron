Ford v Ferrari," A good motorsport film, but no need to 'rush' to see it.
",A pretty solid car racing movie. No real weak parts though perhaps a tad long for such a film. Not in the same class as 'Rush' which had such good characters and story-line.A standout performance from Christian Bale. The backstory developments worked well.WHY are there two titles going around for this film! Most annoying.,7,1,2,8 January 2020
The Equalizer," Another example of 'better left alone'
","Take a decades old, successful English TV series 'The Equalizer', mix it up with an equally old film series 'Death Wish', bring it up to the modern day and rack up the violence. Use tons of the chase and fight scenes you've seen in numerous other movies of this ilk and 'voilà' you have 'The Equalizer 2014'.Denzel Washington is a fine actor, why does he do trash like this?The sound editing and musical effects gained this movie an extra star.",2,1,1,24 September 2018
A Star Is Born," How many times can Hollywood tell this story!
",Star meets wannabe. wannabe gets famous. star gets jealous. star loses confidence. star takes drugs. wannabe loses confidence. wannabe becomes star. add plenty of profanities and a touch of nudity. old star drinks more. family members fall out. new star cries. stars fall out. drunk on stage. star wins award. everything's alright in the end. I think. hard to concentrate by then.,2,3,7,16 January 2019
Lone Survivor," Worse than Rambo
","It had got good reviews, so I sat down with my evening meal to enjoy. Half an hour in and I was beginning to wonder. One hour in and I was thinking, this is going nowhere, it's a five out of ten, and I think I will register my vote. Super American heroes under overwhelming fire power are retreating. They fall down a couple of cliffs, bouncing off granite rocks, their bodies bent 90° as they hit trees. Still they get up, and the bullet tally mounts. All four seem to have taken a dozen or more body shots. And still they go on.By this time I'm thinking how bad can this get, it's a 3 out of 10 now. Amazingly three of the four fugitives finally succumb to all they have been through - at last, though totally improbable that they lasted this long. The remaining hero with all his wounds pushes a broken patella back into his knee (2 out of 10 now) and then takes refuge in a village where the locals take him in. An extremely unlikely situation!Here is where it gets worse than Rambo. Our hero takes a knife and performs delicate operations on his leg, removing bits of tree, bullet or bone - whilst wincing and biting on some cloth in his teeth. Who cares by this stage - we know he can't die!I easily guessed what was going to happen next - the American helicopter calvary swings into view, strafing everyone in the village (apart from the 'goodies') and rescuing our remaining hero. 1 out of 10. Why are people still making films like this? Great sets, acting and camera work, but a film story that beggars belief! The previous evening I had sat down and watching an intensely exciting movie - one actor, two bits of dialogue, but a thoroughly gripping hour and forty minutes - 'All is Lost' - but that's another (far better) story.",1,63,137,16 January 2014
The Irishman," Interesting film based on fact, drawn out FAR too long
","So long! I was just dying for the final monologue to end, that lasted about 20 minutes. Then there was 11 minutes of credits, but I glossed over them. Very well filmed by Scorsese, as usual, but how many gangster films can he make - and the same stars act in!! Good storyline, but should have been under 2 hours. Al Pacino had the best role, and was superb. 6/10",6,2,3,8 January 2020
Brokeback Mountain," Is praise for this film a result of political correctness?!?
","My lover and I watched this movie in anticipation and at the end asked one another what the fuss was about. Oscar contender! The only reason we could see for the praise for this film was that Americans thought it a cutting edge movie involving gays. Hey, Europeans have been making such movies, and far better ones for decades - it's only that the USA is so homophobic that this is making any noise now. Even much better American films dealing with gay and mixed sexuality have been made during the past five years. It was filmed well, and had some nice touches, but was ultimately BORING. I think I must add that Ang Lee seems to be a critic's favourite at the moment for I also thought that 'Crouching Dragon' was again completely overrated. Please watch far more ancient films such as 'Death in Venice', 'The Servant' or 'Victim' to see how well this subject can be treated.",2,33,72,14 April 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I hated it from beginning to end
","Terminator 1 and 2 are two of my favourite movies. Both very original and extremely well made. Seldom has a sequel been as good as T2. However, I was extremely saddened as I sat through T3; a typically bad 'sequel film' with a lousy story line, actors going through their paces with little conviction and depending largely upon the success of the original two movies. Virtually all of the effects and action were a rerun from T2. In every respect, one of the poorest and most disappointing movies I have ever watched.",5,0,0,25 July 2003
Spider-Man," Just a bit more than a run-of-the-mill superhero flick; but does it deserve all those votes?
","In the end, it's just another superhero versus supervillan movie. Yes, the angst of Peter Parker is an interesting addition - both in the original comic strips and in the movie, but the second half of the film is so formulaic that this overpowers the better points. Having said that, unlike other reviewers, I thought the effects were very good and at a large screen cinema, Spiderman swinging through New York streets nearly gave me vertigo, they were so good. The Green Goblin character was pretty banal and the amorous scenes between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson were some of the hammiest I've seen. The music accompanying these scenes was also 'so predictable'.Casting on the whole was good with Tobey Maguire quite perfect in his role as Spiderman/Peter Parker. It is such a shame that a potentially good film was let down by such a weak script and - towards the end - such unoriginal treatment during which the characters become more and more cartoon-like.Sadly, as I write this I see that Spiderman is already in the top 250 films around the 120 mark - a reflection that even IMDB's excellent chart is open to the most recent and over-hyped films achieving far higher positions than they truly deserve. Had Spiderman been released ten years ago I am sure far fewer people would have voted for it and would give it far lower ratings. It is sad that these inclinations cannot be compensated for, even with IMDB's vote weighting. Director Sam Raimi made a 10/10 movie a few years back, 'A Simple Plan', based on an excellent novel, it doesn't figure on the charts as it was an undersold, under hyped movie, yet here is Sam storming up the charts with a film based on a shoddy script that in my opinion rates 4/10.One final point, I watch my favourite movies (some highly rated in the IMDB charts - such as 'The Usual Suspects', 'Godfather' & 'Shawshank Redemption' - to quote a few) many times over, and I certainly would not consider watching Spiderman again, though I'm perfectly happy to have seen it the once.",7,0,0,20 June 2002
Jackie," A terrible film
","I continue to vote on IMDb for many of the movies I see, but it must be three years or more since I wrote a review. I'm not looking for a jobs or career in that business - which it seems many reviewers are - by the trouble they take to write some excellent stuff.But as some other reviewer have said, usually briefly, this film is dire, and I've been driven to write about it. It covers probably the most important period of Jackie's career, but continually jumps about and viewers learn nothing new. And I mean NOTHING! A lot of this is due to a terrible soundtrack where so many people are whispering and mumbling. This prevented me making any sense of what they were saying, much of the time.Portman gave one of the best performances I've ever seen in 'Black Swan' but here she is completely wasted in a fuddled script with poor direction.An utter waste of time. Where do these good reviews come from, and why is it considered Oscar material.",1,8,14,26 February 2017
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," So slow
","I hate giving up on a movie but really wanted to do so with this overlong, totally boring film that amounted to precious little in the end. It was good to eventually see some reviews that gave it 0/10,seeing it in the same light as I did. I can only guess that some wannabe film-buffs gave this film a high mark and pontificated on it at such great length. I wanted to keep this review short but I have to add more lines they say, though the film doesn't warrant it. I didn't want my review to be as long and boring as the film was!However, I can add that the film was unnecessarily dark throughout, the dialogue was often hard to distinguish and it really came over as a poor quality 'Forest Gump' - which was a really great movie.",1,3,9,31 May 2011
Jack Reacher," A real entertaining film
","Well I've become quite a 'Reacher' fan this year, reading a few Lee Child's excellent novels.So of course I've had to take a look at the two movies made so far. 'Reacher' was pretty good, a 7/10 in my book, but I would have to give 'Never Go Back' 8½, which doesn't equate with IMDB, so 8 or 9 will be decided when I post these reviews.Both these movies were what films were meant to be - entertaining, in their way.'Jack Reacher' was certainly entertaining in most ways. My only criticism would be that the editing was a little pedestrian and many shots were held too long. Was the female lead a little bit wooden?Having said that, solid entertainment.",7,0,0,26 March 2020
American Made," Not a good match
","A lot of people seem to think that Tom Cruise and Doug Liman work well together. I don't. This turned out just an average flick for me, whilst 'Edge of Tomorrow' was pretty much a disaster for me.Tom Cruise is really great in the right movies and neither of these two was one of those.",6,0,0,31 March 2020
War of the Worlds," Extremely disappointing
","The 2005 'War of the Worlds' was one of those movies I thought I would talk about using the phrase 'very enjoyable at the time but imminently forgettable - a phrase I use for many Hollywood blockbusters.I was wrong! For me, it was boring almost throughout and certainly imminently forgettable. Sure the effects were well up to scratch, and I like the tripods - but the characters COMPLETELY lacked soul and although the film followed the basic storyline, thank heaven - I was forever awaiting the film's end. I generally like Tom Cruise but this did nothing for him, and I can hardly believe that Spielberg could have directed this.Read the book, or see the much superior original film version.",Null,3,6,29 July 2005
The Queen," A great slice of history
","In a way I don't want to critique 'The Queen' so much as as what is going on on our wonderful IMDb website. 'The Queen' is much in the news at the moment and so when I searched for it under that name, I expected it to be the main contender, but hundreds of other films came up with 'queen' in their title and (although I could not be bothered to scan the whole list) I could not see the current movie starring Helen Mirran. This film was top of the list when I searched for 'Helen Mirran'. Some mistake here, I think! Once in the the correct pages I found many (expected) excellent reviews of this movie and I would just go along with most of these. Helen Mirran is utterly superb and I can only imagine that she will NOT win the Oscar for best actress because so many people are now saying she will. Such is life - but she gets my vote.Her performance alone would not make this the great movie it is. ALL the characters - particularly Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Tony Blair are brilliantly portrayed and the use of newsreel footage used to advantage.It's a few years since Frears has made such a tremendous movie - and I feel that in many countries of the world he would probably have been executed for making such. However, in the end, it is the viewer that makes up their own mind as to whether England's queen is hero or villain; Frears and Mirran together do such an excellent job in leaving the final interpretation up to you.",8,0,1,9 October 2006
Beowulf," Maybe the worst movie of all time
","Up to now there were a number of films that I rated as ZERO, with no particular 'worst ever'. But I am now watching 'Beowulf' - thankfully drawing to a close (I hate not to finish a movie) - and I think I must rate this as the absolute pits because it cost a lot of money, had a known director and a cast of many stars. Shame on them! It is hard to drag this comment out to the required IMDb length but I have to do it. I can hardly credit what I am watching; 'Invasion of the killer tomatoes', Amerikan 'Ringu', 'Bullet to Beijing' - eat your heart out, you must simply pay homage to this absolutely terrible movie. Even the animation was as bad and similar to the awful '300'.Thank god for 'Lord of the Rings'.",1,2,6,7 June 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," What's the point?
","I was entertained for two hours and this film had many good action scenes but what is the point, please? Not only have we seen it all before in previous Die Hard films but we've seen it done ad nauseam in countless other movies. How can such a derivative film get a score of 8 in the IMDb ratings against all those films out there with some originality. I know films are for entertainment, but with all these movies we have to totally suspend disbelief in a desensitizing manner rather than an artistic one. If this had been the only movie of its kind I would have been far more appreciative but as it is, it's Hollywood Hype all over again.",5,2,5,11 July 2007
