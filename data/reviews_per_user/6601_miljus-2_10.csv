The Blair Witch Project," Piece of crap
","A clever publicity campaign made this ultra low budget boring movie a box office success.I hate'd so much,and it fails to deliver on all counts especially in it's weak direction and the camera makes you nervous .Altough the 6.1 rating is not a masterpiece for this garbage movie it's too much overrated,the sequel BOOK OF SHADOWS BLAIR WITCH 2 was slightly better though couldn't be worse than the first one but i have to congratulate those who made the public campaign of this movie because they turned a low budget failure into a box office success. CLOVERFIELD at least was slightly better .One of the worst movies of all time .",1,2,3,17 May 2008
Terminator Salvation," Better than rise of the machines
","O.k it's neither T1 or T2, but who can match them? It's only an entertaining , all out action with decent plot (though it contains some plot holes) and decent acting especially Christian Bale who did a good job much better than his role in the Dark Knight in which we didn't understand that stupid accent.What can i say more the charisma of Arnold Schwarzenegger everyone will miss it but director McG manage to make the film work much better than Jonathan Mostow's Rise of the machines but not quite in the same league of the James Cameron movies.Well it's a nearly 2 hour movie that is surely worth it to pass your time by despite what the critics say.",8,4,7,6 June 2009
Predator," Payback time
","Payback time two words said by one man of legendary ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGER rescue team,that's what i felt for this movie to payback respect for one of the best sci fi movies ever made.I have to say that the entire rescue team led by Arnie and ROCKY'S opponent CARL WEATHERS was excellent and sometimes hilarious guys because they can make you smile too sometimes with some excellent comments said during the movie.This probably John Mctiernan,s greatest movie although DIE HARD was good too,but this movie remains unique for it,s style,suspense and great sense to entertain you.1987 was surely a year where PREDATOR has to be remembered.",10,11,13,19 May 2008
The Shining," Wendy i'm Home
","I'm a big fan Stanley Kubrick and this is my favourite movie of him. The Shining is in my opinion the best horror movie ever with excellent atmospheric direction from Kubrick a good score and effective performances from Danny Lloyd, scatman crothers and Shelley duvall though there is who criticizes her but i liked her here even jack is good but sometimes goes a bit over the top and the ending is a bit strange but no one can deny it it's creepy, atmospheric and sometimes scary the best elements with a good score to make a great horror movie the 1997 version was good too though it's not good as this one even if it is more faithful to King's book but it isn't scary as the Kubrick version",10,7,12,17 May 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," ''Hasta la vista baby''
","a great soundtrack,a magnificent performance by MR.ARNOLD SCHARWZENNEGER as T-101 and equally by ROBERT PATRICK as T-1000 and a new masterpiece from director JAMES CAMERON.Along with the first TERMINATOR, BACK TO THE FUTURE,PREDATOR,THE ORIGINAL STAR WARS ,TOTAL RECALL AND COCOON this is one of the best and most entertaining sci-fi movies of all time with a great plot and even greater special effects in few words spectacular and marvelous ,personally even better than the otherwise classic the original TERMINATOR.The third one surely was not in the class of the first 2 , and neither future terminator will be.There's only 1 Terminator and his name is ARNOLD SCHARWZENNEGER.",10,1,2,20 May 2008
Big Fish," Movie Magic
","You can put this delightful drama in the same level of classics like Forrest Gump (from which i think was inspired), Rocky, To kill a mockingbird and One flew over the cuckoo's nest for it's incredible way to entertain and like Forrest Gump it's surreal life is a special delight like it is the life of Edward Bloom it's a great fantasy of life which contains sympathetic characters begin from Edward Bloom's character till Karl the Giant's character and even De Vito's character was good.Make a favor to yourself and watch this incredible drama with a great touch of comedy and fantasy and sure will make you smile and you will want to see it again.",10,0,0,4 October 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Sam Raimi invites you for a trip to hell
","Spiderman director Sam Raimi invites all true horror fans for a terrifying trip to hell,the victim is Christine Brown (Alison Lohmam)who works at a branch and one day she is confronted by an old woman asking her for another extension and from here begins the terrifying trip for Christine brown,but from here till the end we have to give high marks to director Sam Raimi that from sequence after another succeeds brilliantly in scaring the viewer . The only minor fault in my opinion is the slightly over emphasizing in special effects but this movie stands as one of the top 5 horror movies of the last 25 years . True horror fans can't miss it.",9,1,2,19 June 2009
Rocky," ''you're gonna eat lightning and you're gonna crap thunder''
","put this in the list of the best 5 drama movies ever made with probably the best performance ever from Sylvester Stallone and not less from burgess Meredith,Burt young and Talia shire.It's the story of a simple and ordinary man's life which turned to be an American hero for many audiences that watched this low budget but incredibly beautiful movie.It made Sylvester Stallone's career alongside with his other great movie FIRST BLOOD stands as his best movies the sequels where good too ,but this one had heart.Great merits even goes too director JOHN G.AVILDSEN who helped this low budget become the movie of the year.1976 was the year that everyone should remember ROCKY,TAXI DRIVER,OBSESSION,THE OMEN,CARRIE AND ASSAULT ON PRECINT 13 what do we need more for a year.",10,0,0,19 May 2008
The Happening," come on it's not that bad
","O.k the performances are not that great, although Betty Buckley as Mrs.Jones gives a great 10 min performance ,the fact that others were being infected and mark wahlberg his wife and the child survived seems a bit odd too and the twist in the end if there is one is very difficult too understand , o.k i agree with those who criticise director M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN for these facts because even the script have it's holes too and from a director of his calibre people pretend something better but there are many good points and i don't understand why the IMDb users are giving him all this bad reviews because no one can deny these positive points in the movie :No1 the movie is rarely boring and it's gripping from the first scene till the end only in some scenes in the middle of the film tend to lose it's grip.No2 i've seen comments here about the last 40 minutes of the movie that are horrible, o.k the first part is a bit better but the best and the surely most terrifiying parts of the movie are the scenes which involves the creepy and scary character of Mrs.Jones that made me stay gripped to my seat in the theatre.No3 i think the reason that this movie is critically bashed because it is directed by M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN and people had expected more . I'm not a big fan of M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN but i happen to enjoy it despite it's flaws which are admirable evident",7,2,9,16 June 2008
Back to the Future," Incredible Entertaining
","Back to the future is surely in the list of the most entertaining movies ever made, you would not see the time pass.I Loved every minute of it especially when Micheal J Fox goes back to 1955 and meets his mother.Micheal j fox and Chritopher Lloyd are simply terrific in this movie brilliantly directed by Robert Zemeckis who made some of the most entertaining movies in film history .It stands as the best sci fi comedy movie ever made and captures the level to be listed in every list of top movies ever , 2 sequels followed which even captured the same level of this one but this one remains the best,although the whole trilogy is nothing short than hilarious.",10,1,1,17 May 2008
