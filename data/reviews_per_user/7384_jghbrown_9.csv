Scarface," A good man turned bad
","Tony Montana was a man who wanted to get married and have children.He had some excellent qualities. He had incredible courage. How many people could watch their friend being carved up with a chainsaw and then spit defiance into the face of the man who did it? He was honest and forthright. He loved kids. He loved his sister. And his friend Manny.Somewhere along the line he came to the belief that in order to get married to the most suitable woman you would need to have lots of money. So get rich first. With all the trappings - the boats, the fancy cars and gaudy residences (and, of course, tigers) - which are likely to attract the right sort of woman. But how do you achieve that if you have no education or skills? Well, crime of course.So there was the man who wanted to get married and have kids and the man who wanted to get rich. And gradually these two individuals grew apart and began to destroy each other. As the movie progresses he turns into some kind of bloated monster, snorting his way like a pig through ever-growing piles of coke as he begins to realise that the vast sums of money he is making are not delivering the things he at heart wanted. Moreover, he is less and less happy and snaps at every little thing. The filming is deliberately over the top, from the comical and tastelessly gaudy furnishings of his home, to his boorish and drunken behaviour at an up-market restaurant. His wife (who is not a dumb blond) despises him. His close associates cringe in embarrassment (and fear) at his ridiculous antics.He knows all this and hates himself for it. But he can no longer escape. He has reached the pinnacle of his financial success and he must go on. Yet, from time to time we hear from the other Tony Montana. He keeps asking after Elvira after she leaves him. At the last moment he refuses to assassinate a hostile journalist because there are kids in the car.Under all the strain (and cocaine) he becomes more and more confused. He is out of his depth. Drowning. He sees himself shoot his best friend and destroy his beloved sister. With another mountain of coke up his nostrils and a suicidal bravado he takes on several dozen people who have been sent to kill him. Realizing the emptiness of what he has become he is out to destroy himself, and he succeeds in this in the end with a melodramatic belly-flop into his own swimming pool. This last is so ludicrous that it's amusing, but that's the person he has become - a man consumed by power, drugs and greed, leaving the other Tony Montana somewhere else along the way.I don't like to see violence in films when it's there to titillate the audience. This is a violent movie because it depicts violent criminals. It's also a movie about a good and talented man who could have been happy with so little but fell into the wrong company. Brilliantly portrayed by Al Pacino.",9,1,2,12 November 2016
12 Monkeys," Chalk and cheese
","I have been reading postings on several websites about this movie, and it seems that everything from the roots of Egyptian civilization through Buddhist cycles of suffering and rebirth to ancient Christianity are somehow to be associated with it via a myriad of symbols and subtle hints (doves flying overhead, statues of angels, etc).OK. So what? I don't deny the movie is skillfully crafted, but let's try and see it in perspective. James Cole (JC) may have been intended to 'represent' Jesus Christ, and his mission and subsequent death to 'represent' the coming and the crucifixion of Christ. However, anyone less Christlike is difficult to imagine. While Jesus was an intelligent and gentle man with deep insights into the politics of his time and a full awareness of the significance of his presence on Earth, James Cole is a man of moderate or even limited intelligence who is full of repressed violence, is frequently confused as to his own mental state and has limited understanding of the significance of what he is trying to achieve (and in fact a limited desire to carry his mission through). In my view, it's vitally important for humans to grasp the significance of these differences.",5,0,6,30 November 2008
Black Book," Tears, tart and titty
","The makers of this movie seem to have crafted it in such a fashion as to conjure up as many sub-plots involving sex, violence and double-dealing as could reasonably fit in a 2-hour spell. In so doing they created an extremely fast-paced thriller with more twists in it than a mole's living quarters. Which no doubt will appeal to a certain type of movie-goer.However as a result the film loses much of its moral authority. Take, for instance, the episode where the house in which Ellis has been hiding is bombed. Almost immediately afterwards we see her singing happily without apparently a care in the world and her only remark regarding those (including half a dozen or so children) who had been sheltering her was to say she was relieved that she no longer had to read boring passages from the Bible to earn her keep. Hmm. In another episode several resistance men are badly beaten and then dragged off by German police but this seems to leave little impression on her. Even after her whole family is murdered she throws herself into the role of tart to the Germans with unlikely enthusiasm.Though her acting in the role of tart is superb, as a heroine she seems to be distinctly lacking in intelligence. She seems constantly to be out-of-depth. Manipulated by others, she never seems to have a coherent plan of her own, and frequently allows herself to be led into traps. There are the seeds in this story of a great cat-and-mouse thriller if she had been allowed to have a bit more brain and a bit less of the other. This could have taken the movie way above the general Hollywood fare. However the authors seemed to have aimed for the box office. A great pity, given the excellent standard of photography, dialog and acting throughout.The climax of the movie when she is turning the screws in the coffin is just ludicrous.",Null,2,4,6 December 2009
MASH," OK if you enjoy harassing people for no reason
","I hated this movie when I first saw it 30-odd years ago and I still do. This doesn't seem to me to be funny in any way, unless you enjoy seeing people being publicly harassed and humiliated for no other reason than maybe they are straight or (worse) female. The harassment of the unfortunate women is downright infantile and today would be constituted as a criminal offense. The unit itself is, in delicate military terms, a shower of sh*t, as there is no apparent organization or discipline. As it lumbered towards its banal conclusion I developed this intense desire to be their commanding officer, in which event my boot would have come down with impressive force on two asses in particular - those of Hawkeye and Trapper John - propelling them with some haste to a court martial room, and from thence to the sunny shores of detention barracks (military prison).Please subtract 1 from my score and find that you have arrived at zero.",1,11,18,8 August 2017
Bridget Jones's Diary," Enjoyable, despite imperfections
","I'd fully decided I was not going to like this movie. However, the bottom line for me is not the Brazil-sized appendage which we see sliding down the pole at the Lewisham Fire Station, but the Brazil-sized personality which shines out right from the start, and which, for me at any rate, is completely charming and endearing. Warm, happy, adventurous, amusing, unpretentious  her face (especially the mouth) expresses it brilliantly. No, she isn't quite believable as a hard-nosed reporter  certainly not as a literary publisher. She quite plainly enjoys the company of nasty (but witty) Cleaver far more than that of the dreary, stuffed-shirt, cucumber-up-appendage, Darcy. This is because the former is much better suited to her fun-loving personality  he just needs his priorities rearranged (some might say, given a sound kicking). ***possible spoiler*** This is what happens when we tie ourselves to a story, which, though it may be satirical, has strong moral undertones  it doesn't all quite fit. Luckily, however, the personality wins in the end. People like Bridget really do make this world a better place and Zellweger portrays her perfectly.",Null,1,1,21 November 2004
American Beauty," An average review
","As of now there are almost as many reviews on this site for this movie as for 'The Godfather'. Yet, you may have noticed that they are sharply divided (in the main) between those who love it and those who hate it. It would make an interesting PhD study to investigate the reasons why this is.Me, I'm going to go for average. For sure, the movie is not as profound as it seems to suggest. There is, of course, a great deal of beauty in the world about us. Yet there is also a great deal of ugliness. It's important to know the difference between the two, I believe. One should love but one should also feel anger.All the characters depicted in it have their flaws, apart, perhaps, from the gay couple, whom we never get to know much about. The central character, whose 'flashback' we are watching, is Lester Burnham, played brilliantly by Kevin Spacey.Lester is by no means perfect. For one thing, he is immature, perhaps even irresponsible. If he is angry, it's seldom directed into something worthwhile. He enjoys winding his wife up when he isn't sipping a beer, or smoking dope, or fantasizing about his daughter's best friend. Yet there is a sort of guileless honesty about him, a likeable charm, a flash of childish insurrection, which appealed to me and perhaps does to others. In short, he seems somewhat human, at least by comparison to the others. He is the worm that turned, though in truth he is still mostly a worm.Lester is concerned that people are treating him as though he didn't exist. This touches on one of the major themes of the movie - connectivity. In the rush to live our modern lives we are losing touch with each other and to the natural world. Lester wants to go back to the time when his family were all connected, and he spends a lot of time gazing at a photograph which depicts it.His wife Carolyn, playing equally brilliantly by Annette Bening, is a sexually frustrated go-getter (in a business sense). There is little doubt that she is 'the boss', a fact which Lester resents (and, like many schoolkids awed by teacher, does whatever he can to irritate her). There is also little doubt that she has completely lost contact with her own family. She charges on, like Liberty leading the people, towards destinations and battlefields unknown. On the way she manages to get hold of a gun, which makes a lot of noise (well, it scared my cat) and looks dangerous.Sullen, sulky Jane - the daughter (played by Thora Birch) - apparently hates her parents (and possibly most other people). Though a Freudian slip she makes suggests that she actually is fond of Lester but resents the fact that he pays so little attention to her (as opposed to the time he spends salivating over her best friend). At any rate, she too feels isolated.The only other person I'll mention is Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), the new next-door neighbour with a fancy camera and a shrewd business sense for dealing in dope. You could call him 'Mr Connectivity' since he seems to have the knack for finding beauty in almost everything, even Jane (and a plastic bag which dances provocatively in the wind). He has a strong influence on both Lester and Jane.There you have it. People caught up in the whirlwind of life and in dire need of re-connecting. Not a hugely original theme (compare with Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'), but an important one nevertheless, and handled with considerable humour. Oh, and girls wallowing naked in rose petals.

No Country for Old Men," Grafik violence - with subtlety
","My mother came in while I was watching this movie and she said for shame I ought to turn it off right away. Which of course I didn't.Later I explained to her that it wasn't all violent. No sir, not by a long shot (if you'll pardon the expression). I mean you had this scary looking fellow going round killing people with a cattle bolt gun (or a shotgun, depending on his mood at the time). Every occasion you saw that thing with its long shiny cylinder you knew someone was going to get their chips and end up with their ass a lot further underground than when they started. I have to admit I was beginning to wonder if there would be anyone left alive in the State of Texas if they didn't catch him pretty damn quick.But in between the killings there were these downright interesting conversations where they talked about the way things were and the way they are now and how things went from father to son and stuff like that. Must admit I've forgotten some of it now but it had my full attention at the time.If the movie had a slight flaw it was that you didn't see the moment when Carla Jean got hers. I mean you'd spent the better part of two hours witnessing what that old bolt gun could do both to the human flesh and even to more than a few doors (and some of those looked pretty solid to my eye). And while the scary fellow was sitting there tossing that coin and trying to make her call I couldn't help wondering when he was going to get that thing out and start making a few holes in her. I even went through all the extra stuff on the DVD (though by this time my mother was hollering for me to come down to supper - she's been trying to get me to find a place of my own ever since I turned forty) to see if I could find it, but it looks like they cut it out for some reason.Well, I guess that's about it - have to get on down to the drugstore to buy a few more shells for my pump-action Beretta shotgun. I like to keep it under my bed in case my mother turns bad on me.",3,4,8,16 November 2008
City of God," On patriotism and violent crime
","What is it about violent crime that makes everyone so damn proud of it? From the brainless antics of Al Capone to the drugged stupidity of Scarface (and many others since  I didn't finish Reservoir Dogs cos it ended up in pieces in my garbage can) there seem to be no lengths to which directors won't go to display the trashier side of life and yet make it seem like they're showing cuddly everyday folks.And now Brazil has a chance to flaunt its criminals, and no effort has been spared to demonstrate that when it comes to pointless shootin' and killin' the Brazilians (so it would seem) are way up there in front of the pack. They've even all got cute names, just in case you may decide to warm to them. Actually, I didn't (mostly). The more enjoyable scene of this movie for me was where they were all stretched out across the street dead as old mutton and more full of bullet holes than an rusty tin can in the back yard. I was disappointed that the director didn't follow this up with a shot of a sizeable nuclear weapon consuming the 'City of God' in the sort of fireball which you normally associate with hell.Then perhaps something natural like trees and stuff could take over.",3,7,22,16 March 2008
Mystic River," Murder is (almost) OK according to Mr Eastwood
","Yes sir, if you have the slightest suspicion that someone (e.g. one of your childhood friends) has murdered your daughter, it is perfectly OK these days (according to our esteemed director) to get together a couple of your thuggish cohorts (adult this time) whom you spent time with in prison, get the fellow (back to the childhood friend now) tipsy then stab him in the stomach and blow his brains out. This is not merely OK but downright reasonable behavior, and manly to boot. As what were you doing except avenging the death of your beloved daughter? Not only will this cause your wife to want to have passionate sex with you but you will also have supposedly law-abiding detectives turning blind eyes and deaf ears in just about every direction you can think of.Of course murder (and indeeed the sordid history of child abuse) usually has a long chain of cause and effect. In this particular case, the murder weapon was previously involved in a number of criminal activities in which our avenging superhero was also implicated. So we could say that he was in fact more responsible for the death of his own beloved daughter than was his childhood friend, and perhaps he should have taken the aforementioned weapon to himself and shot himself down like a dog.But then, we wouldn't have a superhero and hardly much of a story. And where would Hollywood be without violent crime and retribution? Or sex?Such is the power of the gun in modern America.",3,0,2,6 February 2010
