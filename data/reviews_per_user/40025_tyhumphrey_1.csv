The Avengers," Joss Whedon is magic!
","Absolutely fantastic as far as Marvel movies come. While I was not able to sit through Captain America, Thor, or the Incredible Hulk standalone, this was a great tie in for all of them. Joss Whedon pulled this off with stunning visuals, not unlike Ironman 1 & 2.The good stuff being said, I could not help but feel like comparing it to the Transformers movies during the final action sequences. I'm not sure why, but it somewhat felt like a close attempt to a Michael Bay style action flick. In the end its better than the other Marvel movies (with the exception being iron man) by a long shot, and as long as you can keep Dark of the Moon out of your mind through it you should be able to find a lot of fun with it.",8,3,8,9 May 2012
