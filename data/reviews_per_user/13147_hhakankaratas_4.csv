The Expendables 2," What action is!
","Do you know what does action mean for people?Action means EXPENDABLES!All stars and all actions are together.Stars may be older,but,they are stars,though!They lost just nothing.What about story?The story is amazing!If i did not know these guys,i would just say that,are they the best actors?Crashing motorcycle to a helicopter and blowing it up?Using cars like using tanks,saving innocent people?giving them another chance to live?the airport scene and their using weapons incredibly?What can be said?If there will be a better movie then Expendables 2,it will be Expendables 3!But,if i may say something about the story of the movie,young guy's death has to be stopped,and when the group is under attack,young guy should come and save them.What about their plane?It is like older but,all of their actions belong to that plane.Adding love to this action movie,make it better than ever actions.Lastly,if there will be Expendables 3,and i hope so,i will be the one of the first ones,being an action-addict.",9,1,2,20 April 2013
Cloverfield," What a good movie!
","First of all,when i was told the name of the movie,i just thought that this movie could be about flowers,or farmers.Then i started to watch it.This movie was amazing!!!Effects and actors' relations made me love this movie.So if somebody says 'can you suggest me a movie,i am , exactly, going to say 'watch cloverfield'.When people realize what they do and what their mistakes are,they decide to jeopardize even their life and try to correct their mistakes.So,actually,movie should be watched in the view of love,instead of a creature coming from other planets.If this movie is about the creature,then there will be more people acting instead of special ones and small groups.This is about coming together by the help of a creature which is just an embodiment of love.What can also be said about the movie is the end of it,the scene of lovers death.However,the movie just has a bad side,in which camera belongs to actor,but,it is good,though.",8,0,1,20 April 2013
Crash," Situations made by prejudice
","I think,all the situations made by people are only because of prejudice and people's bad thoughts.In every part of movie people have bad thoughts and these thoughts cause people to argue,even to break up.In the scene of crash which women died,the man who touched her body before,tries to save the woman.And the woman realizes that this is the man who touched her body before.At first woman does not want him to save her because she does not want to be touched by him,but,man again tries to save her but he can't.At last the woman dies.This situation shows all the things about this film.What is shown also in this movie is racism.Today,do we know how racism is spreading?Isn't that so bad?Crash also shows us that we must not do it,everybody is equal in this world.In the movie,also,while driving a car,a man sees another man walking,in that cold night.He decides to take him.An the man who gets in the car,sees a thing that he also has the same one and wants to show it to the man driving the car.While driving he thinks that another man will kill him.So he stops the car and shoots him.This is bad,after killing the man he realizes that he was going to show the same thing,he was not going to pull a gun.Prejudice is also in this scene?How bad is it?We should be more thoughtful,this movie should be watched by everybody,i think.Thanks :)",8,0,3,11 December 2012
50_50," Man's Fight
","First,its hard to watch this movie,because it makes people extremely sad i think.It is too hard.There is a situation that you can not change.In this situation,while watching the movie,sometimes you find yourself laughing,sometimes you find yourself crying.There is a war that a man fights in,in order to get over.Also in this movie,musics are good chosen ones.Another thing that can be said is that however you are health,you can not even know what is going to happen to you in 2-3 hours.Being alone,the man needs to someone and thinks that the doctor can help him.Thinking this,the relationship between the doctor and the man sometimes assist to the man,while fighting with the illness.The most important thing is hope.Almost every part of the world,there must be some hope,only in this way,people can fight illnesses,people can live.We must thank to god because being healthy and must not let people fight alone.We must join them.By doing this,our power comes together and it gets bigger.Today's world we should see things around us,by doing this,we can get the point of this film.Characters are also good chosen,story is also good chosen,places are also good chosen,this movie should be watched by everyone.And everyone should get the idea and they may also change their bad thoughts.See you.",8,0,0,18 December 2012
