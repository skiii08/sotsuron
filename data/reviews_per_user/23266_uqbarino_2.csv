It," Mr. King congratulated Muschietti, what else?
","Emotionally closer to the book, the director only changes here the order of some facts to tell his own version of the novel; I think he has achieved a film that stands for itself, a film for adults where the protagonists are children. It is about the end of innocence and the beginning of a dark and gloomy age, the world that awaits them when they grow up.",8,2,3,26 September 2017
Wind River," A hard and emotional film... recommended
","It is first and foremost a drama, framed in circumstances of a police character; life in Lander is difficult, not anyone can adapt, and the possibility of losing sanity is as vast as the landscape. Everyone seems to be on their own, especially the few women; all this constitutes a dangerous territory where to survive is everything; solving a crime there is a long and tortuous process, youth seems lost, the middle-aged burden with painful memories and the elderly are already resigned. Different authorities and their jurisdictions are another problem; when there is nothing left but to go to the FBI, a young and inexperienced agent arrives to find realities that she does not even imagine .. she will be helped by a local hunter who carries with his own pains; together they will go on an adventure that will involve more than solving a crime . Neither will be the same when everything ends. Highly recommended film, with good performances and a relentless atmosphere like Lander's weather .",9,2,5,4 October 2017
