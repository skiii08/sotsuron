3:10 to Yuma," Best Western of the Last Quarter of a Century
","it is by far the best western remake (even if they have not been many)since the the well known classic Unforgiven and in some ways its perfection in acting, direction, music and storytelling surpassed the original that was made in 1957. at first i was one those idiots who were sceptical about this remake as i liked the original a great deal and was not sure of the idea of having 2 non American playing western character, even was angry at the casting inclusion of the newcomer Ben Foster and refused to see at the cinemas for those reason but boy was i very wrong!! i have watched it more than once and still this film doesn't fail to surprise me. its the closest thing you will ever get to the spaghetti movies in terms of style and soundtrack but most of the acting style and dialogue that was so similar to those films i even doubted myself at times that i was watching a 2007 film with Crowe or Batman guy Bale. this film is not about good and evil or doing justice, in fact its about lots of themes and my favourite one was when Bale succeeded in making you believe who and what he was and.. i will not go in-depth because i want you to experience hell of a movie and it is definitely the only Oscar worthy film of this year and it will be a huge disappointment if this instant classic doesn't get nominated and recognised by the awards.",10,3,8,11 January 2008
