Hereditary," Please don't believe the hype
","Terrible movie, not even close to any good movie mentioned in some of the other reviews. Have no clue what the movie is about. After the disappointment you can have a good laugh because it's so ridiculous. Save your good money and buy yourself a beer of wine!",2,3,6,23 June 2018
