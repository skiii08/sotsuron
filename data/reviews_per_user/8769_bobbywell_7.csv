Blade Runner 2049," Meh
","I remember seeing the original in theaters. Several times.
I went to see this in the theater. Watched again on video.
Visually it's stunning and worth a watch.
After you see it once you will have no desire to watch it again.",5,4,8,17 February 2020
Sleepy Hollow," At his best
","This movie was an example of the early Tim Burton. When he was at his quirky best. The headless horseman tale come to life. With a wicked twist.
Visually stunning. Fast paced. Very enjoyable.",8,0,0,30 November 2018
Caddyshack," A Classic
","This movie was great when it first came out and it's still great today.
Some of the greats of comedy.
Great directing, writing and timing.
And most importantly the best use of a candy bar in a movie.",8,2,4,7 February 2019
Clash of the Titans," Uuggghhhh
","Was helping out with a group of children and they asked to watch 'Clash of the Titans'. This was the one they chose.
This was almost physically painful.
Syfy channel caliber computer animation.
The plot was a rip-off of the original. Except the writer apparently couldn't remember much of it.
Good actors wasted on a bad movie.",3,0,4,26 May 2019
Blade Runner," Wow
","Just watched this again today. April 2019.
Still great almost 40 years on.
Great plot.
Magnificent actors/ acting.
Visually stunning.
Still a must see.",9,1,3,21 April 2019
Life," Agressively mediocre
","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. Good actors, intriguing subject. Cool.
Then the movie started.
Does anyone in Hollywood know anything about protocol?
Sterility? Isolation?
This movie follows the same lame tropes that Hollywood has used for years.
If you want a good alien loose in the ship movie, Alien holds up nicely. Don't waste your time on this.",5,3,6,24 March 2019
Incredibles 2," We waited how many years for THIS sequel????
","First: the original was awesome. The characters were fun and the animation great. Good plot and character arc.
This one...not so much. Animation was great.
It had a cute sub-plot with Violet which was the best part of the whole film.
There was no new character development. The action and plot had BIG holes in it. Holes so big my 7 year old was pointing them out during the movie.
I'm not anti-Incredibles 2, just very very disappointed.",6,1,1,11 February 2019
