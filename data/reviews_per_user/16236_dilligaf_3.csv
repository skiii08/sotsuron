The Blair Witch Project," What a Let Down...
","I agree with most of the other comments. I was REALLY looking forward to being scared without seeing teen-agers disemboweled (I don't even consider those horror movies...they're slasher movies).  I enjoyed the humorous moments and thought the acting was well done. Also well done was the depiction of the group's mental deterioration.Most importantly though, I was not even REMOTELY scared. The ending didn't do a thing for me and was the ultimate let down.",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
The Others," Thank you for this Movie!
","THANK YOU for this movie!!!! Nicole Kidman was incredible....someday maybe she'll get the recognition she deserves for being the incredible actress that she is. This is the first movie in ages that was not predictable...that had me guessing until the very end...and still thinking about it when I woke up the next morning.Every time I thought I had it figured out (and that's not very hard to do with most movies....especially when you're a true crime/supernatural story fanatic), I was confused again.The movie is deliciously scary with no violence or smut. Just class and good acting and surprises all around.",Null,0,0,21 August 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Missing It's Heart
","I am Arnie's BIGGEST fan.....I don't think it's a coincidence that we were both born July 30!My tradition is to see all of Arnie's movies on opening day and this was no exception. I really, really liked T3....Arnie is still fantastic. My only let down was how little I was 'moved' by the message of the movie, as I was in T1 and T2. This was the only thing I felt was missing....there seemed to be no 'heart and soul.' Would I recommend going to see it? OF COURSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,0,0,3 July 2003
