Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," At least it made me spend time thinking about my reaction
","It seemed fitting that upon arriving home after I saw this movie I channel surfed past a Comedy Channel 'roast' of Pamela Anderson. In that ode to maximizing the ratio of dollars earned per ounce of IQ present, several people - some famous - pulled out all the stops (one surmises there were no stops left to pull) to scrape through the barrel bottom to reach previously unplumbed depths of mean-spirited, profane puerility. It's hard to call it humour.Borat slides right in to that same vein. Or does it? When I found myself laughing constantly and often uncontrollably through 'There's Something about Mary' I figured then that I could be as caught up in potty humour as much as anyone. Borat, however, goes well beyond 'Mary's' silly and simple sight gags (related often to the middle third of the human body). In that movie, the humour is based upon two factors: the reaction to the initial gag, and also the viewer's realization of their reaction to the gag - they laugh a second time at themselves when they realize they laughed at such silly stuff. Monty Python was often similar.Borat, in contrast, works off a very different premise.First of all, it is about deception. Sure it 'pokes fun' at attitudes towards others. In the global scheme of things of over 6 billion 'others', Cohen leaves us with the suggestion that the way to deal with diversity is ridicule. Cohen suggests that the ridicule need not stop when one is invited into anothers house for dinner - it's OK to leave a turd beside your plate on the way out. That'll fix 'em so they can all be like... like.... who? Which of the >6 billion is the correct model that we should all follow?I don't believe that Cohen and the rest of the production team was out to provide moral guidance or even point out anomalies in our society. I think it's likely that he was simply out to be as ridiculously offensive as possible and choosing the race, moral, religious subjects was simply the vehicle for doing that and, besides, harming animals is against the law.As for the rating (1 out of 10), I had considered initially rating it much higher. The logic goes like this: It provoked me into thinking deeply about my reaction -> thought-provoking cinema is a good thing -> forces a re-examination of both what I know and my moral foundation -> reinforces (or not) my personal moral beliefs -> I should be thankful to the film-maker.Ultimately, however, it made me think: What does this really say about our society and how much we value other people and diversity of views and cultures? This is rhetorical but it's not so much even the movie itself that most concerns me but the effusive reaction to it from paid critics and its box-office popularity.What does it say that we honour a person simply because they have a pathologically low level of inhibition and decency? That we would place such a person in the same league - through awards - as the true cinema artists simply because he pushes the envelope of offensiveness? In our society, we view this as being behaviour to strive for and worth rewarding? Now that I have seen the movie I can question why Cohen was even nominated - much less having won - at the Golden Globes.Best actor? He has the range of a toddler trying to hit the toilet he is sitting on.Similarly, that the Academy would nominate anything about this film for an Oscar - best adapted sceenplay...? What screenplay?For anyone who hasn't seen it... If you must, I suggest stealing it - download it or whatever. Don't pay anyone a cent to watch it.",1,6,14,11 February 2007
Shakespeare in Love," 9 years later & can still watch over and over
","This is one of the few movies that I have given a 10 of 10, maybe the only one. There is tremendous skill at work in every aspect of the film. And the passion... yes, the passion.The script is simply amazing. The fabulous humour - written and visual - exists throughout. The depth of meaning and presentation of the various references means three things for me. First, that the writing was done for the pleasure of the writers as well as the audience. Second, the writers know what they're writing about (certainly I recognize Tom Stoppard's talent). Thirdly, my impression is that the screenwriters wrote the cleverness not to be seen to be clever but because it was such fun. Every multi-level reference that I could catch or, more to the point, those I didn't, left me feeling not that I was clever or daft myself (correspondingly) but that there was a richness to the material that could be appreciated at a variety of levels.The devices used in the script, many more than I know but can nonetheless appreciate, such as intermixing a dialogue sequence between real-life and stage is used very effectively to show that there are parallel fictional stories being told. There is no suggestion from the writers that we are watching a true-to-life story. We know at the outset that it is a fiction loosely based at a certain point in the lives of real people. Perhaps in similar way that Shakespeare's works themselves are historical fiction in some cases (though I know little of Shakespeare).There are particular moments of script brilliance where I found myself suspended in time and unable to breathe as if a river was suddenly dammed and subsequently released with tremendous emotion. For example, the stuttering start of the prologue to the play - absolutely fantastic. Foreshadowing is also used effectively if unsubtly at times as are the Shakespearean notions of mistaken identity and gender-bending.Even such contrivances as Lord Wessex getting a paper flyer in the face just after his marriage to Viola are pulled off easily and believably.The acting is brilliant, cohesive and consistent - a magical combination of script, direction, casting and, oh yes, the actors abilities. The characters all gel into a single, 2 hour dance. How does a movie achieve this level of inspired acting and vivid characterization? I don't know, it's a mystery.The direction of John Madden needs singling out for particular praise. I don't know what to say except that it is the director who must, in the end, not only bring the varied abilities of all those assembled into a single gem but to inspire and allow each facet to shine brilliantly. This he certainly does.The music sets wonderful moods and captures (inspires) a real sense of situation.Visual sets and costumes are fabulous.The editing provides a piece that flows so smoothly.One of the main reasons I see movies is to feel an emotional response and this movie certainly provides that. It all works beautifully - I think one can tell when a company is firing on all cylinders - and I will return to this movie from time to time as no other I have seen.",10,0,0,27 April 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Probably great for 8 yr olds
","But for adults, perhaps not.The acting of the children is key for this story (as is the script) I think and what I saw I characterize as the producer directing the director to direct the kids to appear as (unknown adjective) as possible. The result was goofy & wooden characters. The acting was so uneven all around.I'll blame the director.Then there's the story and script. I can't believe the book I read back in grade 5 or 6 was this inane. I don't want to think it was though I can't remember it at all.I'll blame the screenwriter.Special effects were fine.Huge disappointment for me.",4,0,2,8 December 2006
No Country for Old Men," Great technical film but...
","I came away wondering what the point was.The technical aspects of the film (acting, direction, camera, etc.) was, I thought, very well done. I'm still puzzled as to the intent of filmmakers who put a bunch of gore and some very unseemly characters before us.** Some mild(?) spoilers follow ** In addition, in this case, I was perplexed by Jones' character and little hints along the way that make me wonder what he was about, what he knew. For example, he is never proactive in the investigation yet he follows (as opposed to pursuing) the trail. In the final scenes when he returns to the motel, I noticed he took what seemed to be a large step across the threshold. Did he know that someone else was there? There are clues that he did and that he expected someone to be there. Had he become a nihilist and, by returning, was hoping to get shot to get out of his life? And had the sheriff made the connections between evidence and weaponry as he talked earlier about the abattoir? And what was the point of having names which can be confusingly similar: Ed Tom and Anton (in fact, somewhere late in the film, I thought someone did call the sheriff 'Anton').So, Full marks for the technical film but... I'm not going to try and solve the riddles.",7,0,2,15 December 2007
The World's Fastest Indian," Mawkish, hokey, old-guy-can-do-no-wrong, insipid
","Perhaps some old gent from NZ did in fact race his motorcycle across Bonneville and set a record. I guess that much, in that case, would be true. Otherwise, it's a hokey fantasy with no meat on the bleached bones. Don't let Anthony Hopkins participation fool you - the quality here is more along the lines of 'The Edge' than 'The Remains of the Day'. Although, 'The Edge' is waaaaaay worse than this flick and you can take the kids to this one - it's likely intended for tweens - without worry.Although they will see a man in womans clothing. :)And there is a little good cop, bad cop tossed in.Not to mention a 'desert Affair'.Everyone falls in love with this guy.After re-reading my summary, I'm adjusting my rating and giving one star per adjective - down from 5 stars to 3.",3,3,19,5 October 2007
Life," One star for every 10 minutes I could put up with it
","A cross between Alien (I'm sure the creatures went to the same martial arts school) and Little Shop of Horrors with the human character IQ nestled snugly between Dumb and Dumber. 'Ooooh, it's so cute!' (I'm paraphrasing)Please don't waste your time.",2,2,4,3 April 2019
