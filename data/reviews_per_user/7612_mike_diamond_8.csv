The Lobster," Wonderfully weird
","Colin Farrell leads a large cast of talented performers (Rachel Weisz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Angeliki Papoulia) in the offbeat, dark comedy, The Lobster.In the world of The Lobster, single people are taken to a hotel where they are given 45 days to fall in love, or they are turned into an animal of their choice. Why you ask? Because single people are inherently worse than the partnered. At this hotel, all single people seem to have some sort of ailment, because single people are intrinsically broken. There is a constant threat of random violence, but because single people don't have emotions, they hardly notice. They are desperate to conform, but receive no pleasure in it and even if they could find love, they wouldn't really know what to do with it. In summation, single people are brainless animals.This wonderfully weird satire on love and coupling is social deconstruction at its finest and another masterpiece by Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth, Alps).",9,0,3,26 June 2016
The Danish Girl," Come for the set design, stay for the acting
","The Danish Girl is a story set in Copenhagen in the 1920's about one of the first people to undergo a sex reassignment. Although I was not particularly fond of the pacing or character development, the performances of Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander were some of the strongest of the year. Redmayne's portrayal of Einar/Lili made Jared Leto's portrayal of Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club seem as believable as Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. Vikander, who had a huge year, was passionate, loving and vulnerable as Einar's wife Gerda in her strongest role to date. The location, set designs and costumes provide a gorgeous context within which to enjoy the performances.The Danish Girl can be be criticized as Oscar bait, but that accusation infers an elite level of quality. There's no denying that it's a conservative exploration of trans-gendered issues, but it's certainly an accomplished one.",8,1,2,26 June 2016
Youth," Sorrentino shines again
","Paolo Sorrentino continues to create exquisite works of art, and Youth is his latest offering. Retired orchestra conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and over-the-hill film director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) vacation to a luxury hotel in the Swiss Alps, where they postulate love and loves lost. The scenery is charming and the camera-work skilled. The supporting performances are strong, especially that of Paul Dano, who is putting a nice little career together.The dialogue, primarily self-indulgent male existential crisis, regret, missed sexual exploits, and cultural critique, is both serious and satire. Softly floating around the edges of life's larger questions, it finds comfort in the minutiae, imparting wisdom gently without taking itself too seriously. Youth is an honest portrayal of how shallow and simple man is, regardless of station, exposing his insecurities and shortfalls in a funny, intelligent, and beautiful way.",8,0,1,26 June 2016
The Revenant," Iñárritu + Lubezki = Oscars
","For the second consecutive year, Alejandro González Iñárritu has directed my favourite film of the year. His partnership with Emmanuel Lubezki, anticipated to win his record- setting third straight Academy Award for cinematography, is unparalleled in Hollywood. Their combination of artistic vision and technical capacity has produced an astonishing film.The Revenant is a story set in the 1820's about a fur trader named John Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is attacked by a bear and left for dead by his companions.The opening scene, which took a month to rehearse, has as many moving parts as a finely crafted watch. The fur traders' camp is attacked by a band of Arikara Indians who are looking for the Chief's captured daughter. The opening salvo, an arrow through the neck, triggers a cascading battle sequence as the traders attempt to save their booty and their lives. This is when Lubezki is at his best. His technical capability is on full display as he captures the action in one uninterrupted shot, highlighted by moving the camera from a stationary position to a horse in full gallop without cutting. Lubezki's insistence on using natural light, surely influenced by his previous work with Terrence Malick, presented a unique challenge given that the film was shot in the dead of winter, but once executed, rewards the audience with breathtaking scenery.Supported by a talented cast, including standout Will Poulter, Leo and Tom Hardy are exemplary. Leo will win his first Oscar, and not because of his body of work, but because he deserves it.",10,0,2,26 June 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Revisionism by flame thrower
","Set in the throes of a bygone era, Quentin Tarantino's 9th and penultimate film is a revisionist fantasy, romanticized in a quintessentially Tarantino way, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as washed up actor Rick Dalton, Brad Pitt as Rick's stunt double Cliff Booth, and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate.His leading man days behind him, Rick's career is on the decline, relegated to playing the heavy on every primetime show needing one. Rick is cranky and pines for the days of old, lashing out at hippies and the changing times when he's not self-flagellating. Cliff has been Rick's longtime stunt double, best friend, and as the result of Rick's numerous DUI's, driver. Cliff is expertly cool as the counterbalance, content with hanging out and having beers at Rick's house in the hills. Rick's neighbours just happen to be Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate, Hollywood up and comers, juxtaposed ever so perfectly for this tale. The dialogue is snappy and the production design masterful in capturing the sights and sounds of late 60's Hollywood. Our interactions with the characters are never dull, whether sitting in on Rick's line reading in his trailer, watching Cliff feed his pitbull, or following Sharon to the Playboy mansion. The film bounces along nicely for two and half hours and then skyrockets when Tarantino's screenplay conceives an alternate ending to the Tate murders, providing our protagonists the chance to rewrite history. The ending has all the markings of a Tarantino reverie and it alone is worth the runtime. Although an entertaining and loving tribute to Old Hollywood, the film is not without it flaws, most of which are in Tarantino's politics, but we don't look to him to be our moral compass. We watch his films because they're fun, and Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is as fun as a flamethrower.",9,2,3,13 June 2020
Ex Machina," Say it with me: Ex Machina.
","Say it with me: Ex Machina. That should clear things up forever (*shakes head and continues to pronounce it differently each time).Ex Machina, a sci-fi chamber play written and directed by Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Sunshine). Dohmnall Gleeson plays Caleb, a coder in a large internet firm, that wins a trip to spend a week at the company owner's secluded mountain retreat. Once he arrives he meets Nathan, the owner of the firm, played by Oscar Isaac, who wants Caleb to perform a Turing test on his robot Ava, played by Alicia Vikander, to determine if she is 'human.' The question seems simple until confronted with Ava.Elegantly minimalist in style, Ex Machina is grand in philosophical pondering. This film is not just an exploration of man's relationship with Artificial Intelligence. It explores traditional male-female dynamics, the beauty myth, the God complex, and self- determinism, while masking itself in applied science.Oscar Isaac offers a richly diverse performance, but it's Vikander's portrayal of Ava that is superb, balancing vulnerability and manipulation. The script is well-written, consistently building intelligent, thought-provoking scenes, while creating an atmosphere of doomed inevitability, which when it comes, is deeply satisfying.",8,1,3,26 June 2016
Midsommar," A quaint little film exploring Sweden
","Folklore horror meets break-up movie in Ari Aster's Midsommar, starring Florence Pugh as Dani, an emotionally fragile university student, and her insensitive boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor). Unbeknownst to Dani, Christian and his three friends have planned a summer trip to Sweden and when tragedy strikes her family, Christian reluctantly invites her to join. Upon arrival, the crew begins their journey in the most acclimatizing manner possible: by taking hallucinogenics! It is the most realistic portrayal of what it's like to be on drugs that I've ever seen on film. This initiation sets the tone for what will become an increasingly trippy affair. The commune's pastoral setting is quaint and the people welcoming, albeit unusual. The Harga, an isolated pagan community, are clad in white floral smocks, each uniquely embroidered. The stunning outbuildings are out of a fairytale, painted and wallpapered in dalamalning style. The visitors are treated to a formal dinner, but when the post meal walk leads to the Ã„ttestupa, a ritual diving platform where elder members of the tribe perform senicide, we get the sense that not everything is as enchanting as the surroundings. The stakes only escalate from there. Let me tell you one last thing: no, you can't ignore the bear.",8,2,9,13 June 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Witness!
","Nominated for 10 Oscars, George Miller's post-apocalyptic chase movie Mad Max: Fury Road is one of those rare summer blockbusters that lives up to the hype. That may be because the movie literally has its own hype man.The main characters, Max (Tom Hardy) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), bolt across the wasteland of their dying world with the captured brides of ruthless warlord, Immortan Joe. Furiosa believes that returning to her homeland can provide salvation, and the drifter Max has been caught up in the ride. Immortan Joe, and his army of insane followers, will stop at nothing to retrieve his war brides.Amid the literal beat of war drums secured to tricked out dune buggies, the action catapults forward at an unyielding pace. The preposterous villains chase Furiosa and her posse through the desert, atop motorcycles and monster trucks, shooting guns, spikes, fireballs and themselves at our protagonists in an effort to slow them down. These dim- witted steampunk zombies are on a kamikaze mission to Valhalla, and die they do, each one in a more hilarious manner than the last.Are we surprised when the villains fail? I guess I forgot to care with all of the endorphins firing in my brain. This movie was designed solely to entertain you. It is an absurd production that is pure spectacle. So get some popcorn, sit back and WITNESS!",9,1,8,26 June 2016
