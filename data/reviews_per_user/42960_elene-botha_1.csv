Skyfall," And the sky did fall!
","Daniel Craig as James Bond, to me, has always been a winning combination. Through the 007's that he has made, we have seen a more 'human' side to Bond, which has become synonym with Craig. In this regard Skyfall is no different, we see a more aged Bond contemplating stepping out of the service, only to be returned by a sense of duty. Trips to the Scottish countryside and 007's childhood home, all contribute to the 'more human' Bond-image of Craig.But enough of Bond, because for the first time, for me, in a very long time the 007 movies have produced a bad guy that can easily be compared to Heath Ledger's Joker, etc. Javier Bardem plays the role of Silver superbly. During the entirety of the film you have to battle between the sympathy you have for him because of his likeness to Bond and the aversion you have towards him for his intolerable cruelty. Love him or hate him, Bardem captured my attention and blew my mind with his five-star performance.Bravo for, yet again, an entertaining James Bond experience!",8,1,5,14 January 2013
