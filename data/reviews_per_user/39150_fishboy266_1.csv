Alien 3," Boring characters, story - two people were snoring in theater...
","I remember being so excited to see the continuing saga of the Alien universe... What I saw was a boring story, unsympathetic, annoying, one dimensional characters you wanted to die so they'd be removed from the story - we saw that again in Alien Resurrection... The characters in Aliens were one-dimensional also, but they didn't pretend to be 'deep, thoughtful and complicated'. You have to admire the change in feel of the third alien outing, but did anyone read the script? It also seemed to short change the heroic accomplishments of the survivors of the second film to have them die in their sleep because they didn't examine their ship properly before entering hypersleep, why did they need to sleep? Their ship was only 6 weeks out?... Maybe they could have found the alien homeworld or some military types could have smuggled some pods to earth or something... oh well now we have Alien v Predator because they wanted special effects and visuals to take the place of story... when will we have Alien v Predator v Jason v Freddy?",1,317,339,25 May 2007
