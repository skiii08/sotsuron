The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Mesmerizing...
","I don't now how to start. Should i start with the music? Should I start with this red-haired angel Irene Jacob, oh god i think i love her. Or should i start with the cinematography and the direction by this genius 'gospodin' Kieslowski? The film is brilliant, there's no doubt about it. It's mesmerizing and that's really something for me because i can't remember another film i've seen that i can use this word about or maybe just a couple and they are almost all by David Lynch. No, i don't compare this film to Lynch's but they have something in common. They all look like dreams.'La Double vie De Veronique' is really like a dream to me. It looks like a dream, it features one of my dream girls, the story is not so important at all, just like in a dream, and it also features so many metaphors along the way. The whole film is as if taken from Kislowski subconsciousness and put on celluloid. Of course there's also a motif about duality, fatherhood but what struck you first is the overall atmosphere. The cinematography is excellent, here i go, i started with it, forgive me Irene. That's what makes the film so mesmerizing and really succumbs you in it. While i was watching, i really felt i wanted to be there, to live in this world, so melancholic and magical. And i also would like to be there because of Her.OK, i admit i've only seen two of her movies but that was enough. Irene Jacob is the greatest. I can't imagine how it is possible that she fell into mediocrity, or at least i heard so. But you know, i'm not that surprised either. She's not for everyone's taste. And of course i mean her acting abilities too. I heard some users think of her as just a 'pretty face'. Actually i don't think that's bad. Good film actors have to have charisma, a magnetic quality that attracts you in them so that you feel concerned and involved, i would love too see Glenn Close from the back rolls of the theater but not in a erotic thriller. And about the acting abilities - people see Al Pacino shouting at people and think that that's what is all about but it's not. Not all the people in the real world are so aggressive, passionate or so extrovert. Irene Jacob's acting is really very sublime and that's really hard. It's just that her heroine is that kind of person. I would really like to see more of her movies and to see her in new movies too. If not else she remains one of my favorites.And here comes the music. It's beautiful and it's really in the right mood with the film. I was even thinking at one point what if the film was based on the score and not the other way around. 'Gospodin' Preiner is the man responsible. Well done is the least i can say. I'm trying really hard to find the music of the film. The scene with the concert and the subsequent death of Weronika is just so heartbreaking. By the way i like her better than Veronique. Yes, there is differences but you've got to find them by yourself. Or maybe just because she's a 'bratushka'(a Slav).",Null,3,5,20 July 2006
Before Sunrise," Aha - So This is Love
","That was the first thing that came into my mind just after i saw this film. They are right then - it's the greatest feeling of all. And it makes me a little bit sad because i once thought i was really in love too but it turns out that it was not a big deal at all - at least compared to the relationship between Jesse and Celine.Of course i'm aware that such connection is actually really rare and it doesn't happen all the time and to everyone and yet it felt so real, especially compared to those idiotic Hollywood romantic comedies. The funny thing s that i think that 'Befire Sunrise' is much more romantic than 'You've Got Mail' for example. I find it even funnier that it's actually an American movie. But don't forget that it was shot in Europe.Jesse is a young American who of course 'don't speak any other languages' but is really charming and reminds of a Kerouac type of character, traveling around after a bitter break up with his girlfriend. Celine is french, also very charming, witty, sweet, vulnerable and a little bit neurotic and she is traveling to Paris where she studies in the Sorbonne. So they meet in the train to Vienna and after they talk for a while he persuades her to come with him and hang around the city. That's how one of the greatest love stories in the history of cinema begins(that's just my opinion of course).Are they going to meet again after six months on 16 of December(my birthday actually). Are they going to get married, have children, grow old together and so on? You'll find out if watch the second part - 'Before Sunset'(actually this sequel doesn't give all the answers but i assure you that it's simply great, maybe even better than the first film). And i assure you also that if you watch 'Before Sunrise' and after a couple of days 'Before Sunset', you'll have a great cinematic experience. I was really heartbroken after the end of the first film but you know - the ending can't be any other cause otherwise it could have become a standard American romantic movie, maybe not so dumb but not so great either. That was one of the very few movies when i was actually longing for a happy end. I was lucky that i saw it relatively late and i didn't have to Waite 9 years for the sequel.What makes this film so great. Well first of all - Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are simply amazing. The scene at the listening booth, the scene at the cemetery, the ending - they could have received an Oscar for any of this scenes alone. The direction is superb - to watch two young people walking around and talking and yet to feel so compelled. The cinematography is also very good. The script - i don't have words to tell you how great it is. Along with the scenes mentioned above i would like to mention a couple more too - the scene with the bum who writes poetry, very fascinating as an idea; the scene in the morning where they dance on the street and then when they rest and he impersonates Dylan Thomas. Oh please watch this film...or don't...I don't know. It's amazing but it's not for everybody. Personally i thought it was great.",Null,0,1,17 August 2006
