First Man," weirdly boring
","The story of mankind's travels to the Moon is a riveting story of heartbreak, suffering, ingenuity, courage and perseverance. As a result one might think that even a two-year-old baboon could make a halfway entertaining movie about the subject matter. Yet this is a boring and soulless movie - I can honestly state that I have seen more compelling documentaries. Even watching the actual contemporary footage, with or without comments, is more compelling.The problem here is dramatic and narrative rather than visual and technical, since the cinematography is superb. So are the various special effects.While we're at it, the ending too is remarkably bland and cold and ineffectual.'First Man' doesn't satisfy as a biopic, either. I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that Mr. Armstrong didn't go through life looking and feeling that sedated, bland and wooden. At times it felt like seeing the 'Dilbert' cartoon character step into an experimental jet or an Apollo capsule. May God keep you on your perilous journey, Dilbert - and remember, you are carrying the hopes and aspirations of the whole human race !All in all, the movie obscured rather than illuminated Mr. Armstrong's personality - I now know LESS about him than I did before watching the movie.So no, not recommended, although there are some fine images and effects to savour.",4,2,2,30 July 2019
The Fifth Element," science fiction extravaganza
","'The fifth element' is a big, sugary slice of space opera, with a screenplay that feels as if was written by two twelve-year-olds on the back of an old envelope. (Think 'Flash Gordon' with a sprinkling of psychedelic glitter.) The plot does not really bear repeating or summarizing, but it goes a bit like this : Good and Evil, aka Life and Death, wage war on a vast cosmic scale, involving scores of soldiers both witting and unwitting. These wild and diverse armies contain persons of human, alien and (possibly) supernatural origin from all walks of life : warriors, monks, taxi drivers, celebrities, scientists and yes, even opera singers.How to rate the movie ? This is a difficult question, since parts of it are good, parts of it are unremarkable and parts of it are bad. The bad straddles two different categories - simply bad versus so bad that it becomes good - and on top of it all there's a layer of knowing wit. I'm slapping six stars on it, for 'feel free to watch it, but only once', but I can fully understand other ratings.'The fifth element' certainly delivers in the style and beauty department. Some of the best French graphic artists, illustrators and designers collaborated on the project, and it shows. The superbly inventive costumes, for instance, contribute to the general whackiness and extravagance of the movie, by fooling around with concepts of sexuality, gender and even species.Other aspects are far less impressive. The taxi driver protagonist, for instance, lives in what seems like a surveillance and police state. The police certainly aren't going for the calmly didactic approach : they wear frightening uniforms, use heavily muscled methods and think nothing of pulverizing the odd miscreant. But the movie does nothing with these concepts - this dysfunctional background could just as well be multicolored wallpaper.Aaah, science fiction, the genre that likes to tackle big, dangerous ideas !",6,1,4,15 January 2019
Ready Player One," problematic with regard to message
","I have never read the novel the movie is based on, so I can't say anything about its value as an adaptation. I'll just try to review what's out there on the screen.The movie ends on a clear warning : it invites young people to live not in virtual but in actual reality because, well, this is where humankind dwells. A wise and intelligent message, one might think, and a productive one too. However, the movie just spent about an hour and a half lovingly detailing the mental universe of those who live in artificial heavens. Or no, let me rephrase that, of those who are content to live in the artificial heavens others built for them. The movie spent about the same amount of time praising those who immerse themselves in the small details of pop culture, even to the point of obsession. (Many of the characters, including the heroes, are the kind of people - or the equivalent of the kind of people - who spend 800 hours of their precious life discussing whether Captain Kirk's second cousin looked better in scarlet or in teal.)So the movie is certainly problematic, here.I wouldn't like to turn this small review into a sermon, but : if I were the parent of adolescent children, I would use the movie as a starting point for a discussion about, say, the rewards and dangers of vicarious living and the sad waste of a life used for silly trivialities. While we're at it, I would also grab my youngsters and take them on a long hike through a large forest, with nary a laptop or smartphone to be seen.Even apart from these reservations, I found the movie over-long and over-busy, with a relentless 'more is more' - approach which tended to drown everything ressembling real danger or real emotion.I'm still throwing the movie some stars because, in certain aspects, it is very well done, from a technical and technological point of view. Every now and then there are moments of great beauty and charm to be enjoyed. For instance, the movie contained a marvellously fluid and inventive dance between a boy and a girl which reminded me somewhat of the animated gem that is the 'Arab veil dance' from 'Fantasia', set to Tchaikovsky's music.",3,0,1,19 February 2019
The Adventures of Tintin," good adaptation
","Although a Belgian, I've never been particularly fond of Hergé's work : when I read the Tintin series as a child, I liked it well enough but I did not adore it. As an adult, I can recognize its technical prowess and abundant imagination, but I still don't think it's as stellar, innovative or unique as some critics would have it. (Still, credit where credit is due : with 'The 7 crystal balls' Hergé created one of the most scary comics of all time. The moment where a grinning Rascar Capac, both alive and dead, enters a building can wipe the floor with about 99% of the horror scenes contained in movies, comics or novels. It is the essence of nightmares.) As a result of my lukewarm attitude, I began watching 'The adventures of Tintin' without particular expectations. I'm pleased to say that it's both a clever, respectful adaptation and a pleasantly watchable movie. There are (at least) two brilliant set-pieces worth the price of admission alone : the first is the episode where captain Haddock tells of the heroic adventures of his ancestor, and the second is a long and bonkers pursuit through a North-African country. All over the movie there are touches of wit, satire and invention, just as there are moments of clever observation : note the scenes, for instance, where the poor have to queue for water in order to survive, while the idle rich surround themselves with fountains, canals and swimming pools. Authors have written 500-page works on social inequality that say less. I watched the movie with some youngsters, who all left dazzled and enchanted : no mean feat in these modern times.The scene where Bianca Castafiore sings is very well done - there is a truly glorious stream of music coming out of her mouth - but I was somewhat amazed by the choice of music : if I remember correctly, the various comics had her singing 'The jewel aria' from Faust. The jewel aria too is delightful, plus it would have allowed the great diva to perform in Germanic peasant costume, complete with blonde braids. Perhaps some Tintinologists can help me clear up this matter.",8,0,0,21 June 2018
Shutter Island," excellent
","Truly original movie, based on a truly original book. The novel was a master class in deception and misdirection ; the same goes for the movie, which shuffles twists and clues with all the talent of a professional card shark. 'Shutter Island' is drenched both in period atmosphere and in 'noir' sensibility ; there is a pervasive sense of danger, insecurity, unreliability, to the point where the threat of a natural disaster almost comes as a relief. There is also a deep sadness, as befits its main subject, the various horrors associated with mental illness.The acting is excellent, particularly by Leonardo DiCaprio, who lights up the screen with an incandescent performance.",9,0,2,3 October 2017
Nightcrawler," a timely warning
","An enormously vivid movie that actually has something important and relevant to say. Gyllenhaal is superbly convincing as an egregiously awful human/hyena hybrid, while Russo shines as his more polished but equally dangerous enabler. All through the movie I kept hoping for some poetic justice : if there ever was a character who deserved a bullet through the spleen or a collision with a burning truck, it was Lou Bloom. Upon reflection the movie's ending is better. Bloom thrives and is about to divide and multiply himself into infinity, like cancer cells. A cautionary tale about the consequences and side-effects of our desire for ever more shocking and intrusive news footage.",8,1,1,6 February 2018
She's the Man," This is Illyria, laddy
","Surprisingly good-natured and likeable teen comedy, which mixes and re-uses a number of Shakespearean themes and adapts them to our modern world. The writing is clever and there are a number of good jokes. Amanda Bynes (as Viola) and Channing Tatum (as Duke Orsini) are pretty watchable and the rest of the cast does its best, too.Like I've said, the movie is aimed mainly at a teenage audience, but older viewers can enjoy it too.However, this thing works only if you are willing to indulge in some industrial-strength suspension of disbelief. Otherwise you are likely to spend much of the running time shouting things like : 'How can anyone mistake her for a boy ? She's clearly female, you cretins !' or 'How can anyone mistake her for her twin brother ? For chrissakes, he's a foot taller !' Mind you, it gives a whole new meaning to the traditional 'So how is your guide dog today ?' insult hurled at referees.",7,0,0,11 March 2019
Prisoners," suspenseful thriller / drama
","Two families are celebrating Thanksgiving together. The various family members are having a good time and the same goes for the two small daughters, who are great friends. When the daughters go missing, in broad daylight, two sets of parents are confronted with their worst nightmares...To begin with the good, 'Prisoners' benefits from some outstanding performances. Both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal deserve any kind of award the movie industry can think up : they truly disappear into their characters. This is also a very well-directed movie which conjures up a pervasive atmosphere of dread and uncertainty. There's a constant sense of something evil, something unhinged lurking just behind the corner. (When that evil is finally uncovered, near the end of the movie, it turns out that 'Prisoners' has created a villain for the ages.)However, the movie also has its drawbacks. Its many strands and ideas do not fit together perfectly - where, for instance, does this snake motif come from ? - and some plot elements are ill-judged. So two little girls disappear under the most suspicious of circumstances, and the police put only one detective on the case ? What does it take to prod the local police into action, in that part of the world ? A band of radioactive cannibals organising a slaughter of the innocents in City Hall ?The movie explores a grim question, to wit, how far would a loving parent go in order to save his child ? (The answer is : VERY far.) Viewers interested in 'contrast and compare' might want to take a look at a recent French thriller with a similar theme, called 'Mon garÃ§on'.",8,1,1,13 September 2019
American Made," Mixed results
","First the good : there is quite a lot of colour, excitement and panache. The movie clearly works on the 'never a dull moment' principle, piling on the twists, turns, pursuits, escapes and jokes. The numerous spectacular flight or stunt scenes involving airplanes deserve special mention. Sadly the movie is dogged by a number of plot holes. To quote but one example : the CIA hires a pilot in order to transport weapons from point A to point B. This is supposed to become a long-time arrangement, whereby the man executes numerous flights. The pilot does execute numerous flights. However, he does not drop off his cargo at point B, he drops off his cargo at point C, so that the weapons benefit a whole different party. The CIA does not notice or suspect this fact for a very long time.Really ?This, at least to my untrained ears, sounds highly implausible. One would think that someone somewhere would notice that the supposed beneficiaries go weaponless, in the same way that someone somewhere would notice that a third party is receiving huge amounts of weapons it isn't entitled to. Moreover, one would think that the CIA would have some kind of monitoring or supervision protocol, especially when dealing with persons known to be quixotic and unreliable. But nah, the CIA entrusts a delicate and costly mission to a known maverick, without checking progress or results. There are small-town cupcake bakers who run their business with more vigilance.'American made' does deserve credit for pointing out that the CIA has a sad habit of interfering in international affairs, often in the most duplicitous or violent way. However, these episodes deserve a far more searching and in-depth approach than the one provided by the movie.",6,0,1,7 June 2018
Arrival," well worth watching
","This is a well-made and well-acted science fiction movie. There is much to admire, such as a thoughtful plot, a careful construction and fine visual and special effects : the aliens, for instance, are genuinely alien, as is the environment they live in. There is also an intelligent and competent heroine, although one can question the wisdom of some of her choices.Still, 'Arrival' tends to sidestep or neglect the moral and ethical questions it raises itself. The aliens bring a gift to humanity - but what if this gift turns out to be a curse of Biblical proportions ? What if the aliens have unleashed a terrible blight ? I, for one, would not be pleased to be on the receiving end ; moreover, I can't even begin to grasp the scale of the mayhem released on humanity if the gift became general. It's entirely possible that homo sapiens might disappear from the face of the planet in a few generations, crushed by a weight it was never meant to bear. Or else, for instance, we might find ourselves in a world in which the stupid, the callous and the evil reach a ripe old age, while the clever, the sensitive and the good commit suicide before adulthood.Ironically, there is much to be said for the argument that it would have been wise to blast the aliens to kingdom come, as soon as their ships became visible.",7,0,5,27 September 2017
The Greatest Showman," Go and watch a freak show ! Otherwise the bad guys will win !
","From a musical point of view, 'The greatest showman' isn't very interesting : the music is bland and the lyrics are trite. Much of it looks and feels like a watered-down version of 'Moulin rouge'. Still, the various makers of the movie were clever enough to make Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale, sing the same kind of forgettable stuff as the rest of the crowd, justly realizing that their work was unlikely to withstand a comparison with a nice slice of, say, Meyerbeer or Bellini.However, there are worse problems than the musical aspect. The movie is intent on delivering some of the most contradictory messages imaginable. Try this one : 'It is fully okay to look unusual - to be a giant, an albino, or half of a Siamese twin - on condition that you don't mind being stared at for ten hours a day'. In the contradiction stakes, this comes close to gems like 'We fully understand that you're a lesbian, we just want you to sleep with men' or 'As the ruling king of a constitutional monarchy, you are uniquely qualified to spread the word about the benefits of communism'.Another message from 'The greatest showman' : if you gather a group of people with unusual looks or medical problems, and if you put them on display for financial gain, you're not exploiting them, you're supporting them.Finally the movie warns you about the dangers of not wanting to go and see a freak show - chances are that you, annoying spoilsport, are an effete snob, a proto-Nazi or a knuckle-dragging primitive. You're not like that, are you ? So do the right thing ! Do what any decent, all-American, God-fearing citizen would do ! Go and gape at some inoffensive humans with a medical condition !A modest conclusion : people who teach subjects such as philosophy, ethics and logic would do well to give the movie a wide berth, lest they suffer a stroke.I'm still throwing the movie a few stars, because there are some likeable performances and fine stunts to enjoy. Hugh Jackman in particular imbues his P.T. Barnum with a great deal of charm - much more charm, I suspect, than the actual P.T. Barnum ever possessed...",3,2,8,17 November 2018
Lucy," stupid, stupid, stupid
","Violent and unpleasant movie built around two truly stupid ideas : a) the idea that normal humans use but a tiny part of their brain and b) the idea that one can become really, really, really intelligent by taking designer drugs. In fact, taking designer drugs won't simply make you smart : you will be able to levitate, fly, build revolutionary computers, travel through time and space, read minds, render yourself invisible ! It's very reminiscent of the old joke about the little boy asking for tampons as a birthday gift, because with tampons you can do everything you would like to do - go swimming, play tennis, climb mountains, and so on.A small question : have you ever heard of 'endocrine disruptors', chemical substances disrupting the hormone system of both animals and humans ? Such disruptors are, or can be, present in all kind of household products and plastics, such as cosmetics, food containers (think meals to be heated or reheated in the microwave), baby toys, packaging, and so on. Studies have linked the presence of such endocrine disruptors to serious threats to human health, including a diminished intelligence in descendants. Even if only part of these fears turn out to be true, then we're facing a health crisis of stupendous scope and gravity, for which thousands and thousands of innocents will be paying the price. And while we're at it : a general lowering of the IQ is precisely the thing that causes the collapse of a civilization. As a result we're talking about an existential threat.Now here's the strange thing : if you go to a major studio and say something like : 'I dream of making a big budget blockbuster, with stunning stars, about the link between environmental pollution and human health and about the danger to our children's intelligence' there is every chance of being laughed out of the office. In fact, there is every chance of you being escorted from the premises by security guards. And yet there is money and interest to be found for random nonsense such as 'Lucy'. Upon reflexion, perhaps this DOES prove that homo sapiens only uses part of his brain...",2,1,7,22 February 2018
Ran," Superb take on Shakespeare's 'King Lear'
","A Japanse lord has risen to power through many years of warfare and intrigue. Now an old man, he decides to divide his domains among his three sons. In the process, he quarrels with the youngest son, who is the only one sane and bold enough to tell his progenitor the truth, to wit that this is a singularly misguided plan. Slowly but surely the family will rip itself apart, amidst treachery and slaughter...Kurosawa transports Shakespeare's tragedy to feudal Japan. In doing so he re-arranges and re-adapts the story liberally : the protagonist, for instance, becomes an old samurai warlord with a whole household of openly acknowledged concubines. There is also a bitter joke which involves a fox head and which allows for a bit of folklore about beautiful shape-changing women who set out to beguile unsuspecting men. The move to feudal Japan works very well, for a variety of reasons. To begin with, this backdrop preserves the great themes of class, power, prestige. Secondly, the viewer is immersed in a rich and complex culture which can produce extremes both of violence and of beauty, often at the same time. (Some of the movie's costumes, especially the aristocratic ones, are so exquisite that they deserve a fashion museum of their own.)This is an epic movie with an exceptional visual grandeur. It is also a deeply pessimistic movie. 'Ran' deals not just with the folly of a single man or a single family : it deals with the folly of Mankind, which could live peacefully on a generous and abundant Earth but prefers killing and looting...Much recommended. Watch it on a large screen.",10,0,1,19 September 2019
Moon," outstanding science fiction movie
","'Moon' is well worth a detour. It's got a good, intricate plot, a clever screenplay and fine direction. Sam Rockwell is also quite good as a stressed-out astronaut who might be going sane, going mad, or both at the same time. (Here it's hard not to think of the oldies but goodies along the lines of 'It's not because you're paranoiac that there aren't people out there trying to get you' or 'I know I'm not a schizophrenic, my other self told me so'.)In its own way 'Moon' reminds the viewer of the bitter fact that technological and scientific progress can go hand in hand with moral barbarity, especially when monsters like extreme patriotism or savage capitalism rear their ugly heads. Completely inoffensive persons get treated as replacable, interchangeable, fungible - but it's all for a higher goal, of course. The common good asks for an occasional little sacrifIce...",8,0,0,9 June 2019
Sully," a mixed bag
","The good news : Eastwood wisely refrained from cheap melodramatics. Sadly the movie veers too much in the other direction (pardon the pun), causing the story to lose much of what made it so remarkable in the first place. 'Sully' does not contain much in the way of epic grandeur, white-knuckle tension, unbearable suspense or trenchant comment. There's not even much dramatic conflict or contrast ; even the various aviation experts and inspectors grilling Captain Sullenberger are just hard-working people trying to do an ungrateful job.To continue with the good, the landing in the river is superbly filmed, from a technical viewpoint, and there is a fine performance by Hanks. It's a pity that Mr. Hanks has played this kind of role - competent and decent man rises to the challenge - so many times before : it is not a case of Captain Sullenberger being played by Tom Hanks, it is a case of Tom Hanks playing Captain Sullenberger, which is lethal to the suspension of disbelief. And yes, I do realize that there's an injustice involved,since Hanks only became a world-famous actor thanks to his hard work and stellar talent - but that's Art for you, she devours her own darlings.One also wonders at the way some of the characters were conceived. I do not know Mrs. Sullenberger - I've never even met her - and as a result it would be hugely presumptuous of me to write anything about her nature and temper. For all I know, or don't know, she may be one of the most delightful and enchanting persons living in the USA. Mrs. Sullenberger the character, however, is seriously annoying : dull, shallow, whining and ungrateful. One gets why her husband (again, I'm talking about the character) travels the world - anything to put 200 miles between him and boredom personified. It is less clear why he neglects to engineer a sad accident where his spouse falls out of an airplane.If I were real-life Mrs. Sullenberger, I'd go and consult a good lawyer with a background in libel cases.",7,1,2,21 November 2017
