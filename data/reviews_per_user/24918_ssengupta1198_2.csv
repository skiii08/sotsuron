Ford v Ferrari," A pure cinema with a brilliant story.
","Ford v Ferrari is a 2019 American sports drama film directed by James Mangold and written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller. The film stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale, with Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remo Girone, and Ray McKinnon in supporting roles.The plot is based on a true story, two men - American car designer Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and British-born driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale), take on the racing team of Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race by building their own. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles were dispatched by Henry Ford II and Lee Iacocca with the mission of building the Ford GT40, a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant Ferrari racing team at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France.The plot is built on the automotive battle between two corporations, but director James Mangold narrows it down to two person character study. Both Matt Damon and Christian Bale understand their character's strong personalities and use it to fuel the dynamic between their respective characters. Christian Bale is brilliant and mesmerises the audience yet again playing Miles - a volatile underdog that Ford doesn't want on their team. Miles is at the heart of the film, and Bale is almost magical to watch. Matt Damon is far more fleshed out character as Carol Shelby and gets his big moments on screen which he makes the most out of. Their combination and chemistry is exhilarating; you can't help rooting for the two when they're on screen, even without any cars involved. Speaking of which, James Mangold directs the racing sequences to convey not just the frenetic energy, but also to further the character arcs.Besides the two leads, the supporting cast contributes brilliantly to the film as well. Jon Bernthal is solid, and so is Caitriona Balfe as Mollie Miles, but the most heartwarming relationship is between Miles and his son Peter, played by Noah Jupe. This pushes the pedal on the screenplay, which keeps it thrilling and, surprisingly humorous enough to ensure there's not a dull moment in its two and a half hours runtime. Motorheads and racing fans are guaranteed to love 'Ford v Ferrari', but even the casual moviegoer will get a brilliant 'against-all-odds' story as well. 'Ford v Ferrari' at the end of the day is what one might say a real cinema, the kind of solid, satisfying, non-pandering movie that might seem endangered nowadays.",9,1,2,1 May 2020
1917," Cinema can still be a marvel with simple technology.
","1917 is a World War I drama directed, co-written, and produced by Sam Mendes. The film stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, with Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong, Claire Duburcq, Benedict Cumberbatch and Richard Madden in supporting roles. It is based in part on an account told to Mendes by his paternal grandfather, Alfred Mendes. The film tells the story of two battalions of the British Army are being steered into a trap set by the Germans in World War I. Their only hope is a pair of British soldiers assigned the impossible mission to deliver a warning about this impending disaster. This message is especially important to one of the soldiers, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) as his brother is taking part in the pending attack. Blake takes Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) along on this harrowing journey across no man's land into enemy territory.This brilliantly shot drama that won best picture honours at the Golden Globes - Mendes uses his favoured 'one-shot' format from his previous works like 2015's Spectre, but this time stretches it out to feature length. 1917 uses several takes and set-ups, seamlessly conjoined to give the appearance of a continuous cinematic POV, albeit with periodic ellipses. The result is a populist, immersive drama that leads the viewer through the trenches and battlefields of northern France, as two young British soldiers attempt to make their way through enemy lines on 6 April 1917. But well beyond the ingenuity of the one-take shot, the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is reflected in the performances as well, with both leads swapping the narrative focus from each other in meticulously planned storytelling beats. The performances of the two young leads Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are engaging, as facets of their otherwise ordinary personalities come through. The mission is the key focus as the two soldiers make their way through increasingly dangerous situations. Along the way, they encounter key army personnel, played by a cameo row of British actors, including Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden who put in brief, but impressive performances.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is mesmerising, choreographed and executed to perfection around the horrific elements of war. Some of the frames are visually breath-taking, and demand to be revisited to absorb everything they have to offer. Throughout this journey, Thomas Newman's pulsing score builds up the tension, travelling 'up the down trench', through the body-filled carnage of no man's land and into the eerie surroundings of deserted farmhouses and bombed-out churches. Occasionally, we hear echoes of the rising crescendo while elsewhere, the score is full of piercing melancholia mingled with distant threat. In a film in which music plays such a crucial role, it's significant that perhaps the most powerful scene is an interlude of song. Emerging from a river after a baptismal episode of death and rebirth, we find ourselves in a wood where a young man sings The Wayfaring Stranger. It's an interlude that brings the characters and audiences together in silence, communally experiencing that still-small voice of calm that lies at the heart of so many great war movies.",10,0,3,1 May 2020
