Blade Runner 2049," After the 'second coming' they will no longer even suspect that they are 'replicants', since they have become PSDO's (Psychically Defunct Organisms)
","The first Bladerunner slowly but surely became recognized as a masterpiece in motion picture art, not merely because of the excellent visual art and music that created a unique kind of mood in the audience that built itself over time, but more so because of the deeply thought provoking story on which it was based: Philip K Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?'. The screenplay or the script and dialogues developed by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples builds on that to become the fulcrum and central art of story telling around which the other arts are supportive but peripheral. Sadly, most fans of the movie merely go wow on the peripherals like acting, visuals and the action scenes. Ironically, one of the pointers in the story is about the degeneracy in humanity as a result of the 'Celebrity Culture' of postmodern societies that completely miss the 'Real' stuff that makes us human and go only for the 'Hyper-Real' or the superficial to hang on to in silent despair which is not even acknowledged as despair, since the mass of humans are too dazzled by technology and the imagery, the entertainment and the sensations generated by it. What remains as a result is a strange nostalgia for a 'real life' or deeper human emotions like love that become increasingly rare and elusive.This sequel, after a very long gap, has been clearly made for the fans and by a fan, and not for the connoisseur of intellectual art or that artist/intellectual who is acutely conscious of the tension between 'nature' and technology, and specifically between the 'natural organism' versus the genetically modified organisms (GMO), called 'replicants' in these movies that are looked down upon by 'humans' in the movies. Unlike in the movies in 'real life' the GMO is much sought after by the Scientistic community for its 'potential yields' and particularly for the corporate scientist who eyes the likely profits from these GMO's, and the rest of the masses keenly wait for the technology of 'designer babies' and super-intelligent off springs that will colonize the universe. The 'natural' has become almost completely subservient to the technological - the prime symptom of the Postmodern culture in which Scientism is the ultimate religion. The horrors unleashed by these technologies, particularly the devastating effect on the human psyche, is felt by very few in this globalized culture, mainly the artist-writer who agonizes over how to pour it into a powerful story. This 'ecstasy of communication' was reflected in the story by Philip K Dick, and wonderfully articulated in the first movie. The essence (or 'soul') of the story started falling apart a few years later when Ridley Scott decided that Deckard was a replicant. All the fans took that as a gospel truth, and therefore I am beginning to suspect that Scott himself is a replicant! Such are the times. The only thing I can say with certainty is that Philip was definitely not a replicant! I join those critics that say that the 'second coming' is all style and no substance. All the money has been blown up in visuals, no money and energy seems to have been spent on the story. The script and dialogues are nothing compared to the first, and a pathetic attempt to dabble in metaphysics by casually throwing in the word 'soul', also falls flat. Ford looks totally burned out, and has been thrown in just for the fans, in the hope that such cosmetics will improve the profits. ('Show me the money' he says). The other lead actors have done well and do lift up the other-wise dreary story line, to inject some emotional 'masala', especially for the fans. The time and money spent by me in watching this movie is recovered by the provocation it generates to write this review, even if this only highlights what is missing. I won't go as far as to say that this movie is a wasted effort since it was inspired by the brilliance of the first, and even a failed attempt to copy a work of art is a small but significant struggle to remain human in such times when the downwards spiral of humanity is accelerating. As they say 'nothing ventured, nothing gained'.",1,6,13,31 October 2017
Fight Club," Plight Club: in the end, it will be too late to stop it.
","There are two basic modes in which every animal (including human) lives its life. The first mode is characterized by security, safety, comfort, patience, defensiveness, caution, consolidation, inhibition, staidness, mildness, meekness, suppression, submission and conformity, whereas as a complete contrast the other mode is characterized by aggression, assertion, excitement, risk, initiative, boldness, spontaneity, impulsiveness, recklessness, violence and domination. Often the shift from the normal staid mode to the aggressive mode takes place very rapidly, even as small as a fraction of a second.Modern man has been forced by the need to attain social control of the masses to suppress the aggressive mode which was a necessary mode for the hunter-gatherer and warring man to survive and thrive. Today, most people have been programmed to live the staid life of a 9 to 5 routine, neatly dressed up, working to build a comfortable life, accumulating possessions that fortify this life style of maximizing luxury. But there is a downside to this: there is no sense of adventure left, it is a lifestyle of ultimate boredom because it is totally predictable, it leaves no room for a creative, innovative choice driven life style, and the mass aggressive outlet is in the contrived wars that dominating nations unleash upon the hapless smaller nations that dare to defy them even in the most trivial of issues. The only positive mass channeling of this aggression is in competitive sport or games, but come to think of it, that too is a contraption which is a distraction from the genuine aggressive response whose real value is in creativity.The other result of this suppression is in the development of a neurosis that leads to mental disorders, drug addiction, life of crime and ultimately an irresistible urge to destroy it all without even being consciously aware of it.Fight club is a story that vividly encapsulates this plight of modern, civilized man, the developing neurosis, the urges of aggression that are a response to boredom, the need for genuine excitement and adventure that are now a near impossibility, all build up to the inevitable destruction that is the only default genuine excitement that is left for man, an urge to destroy, that modern man is not even conscious of and will not be conscious of until the last moments of 'recorded time', and by that time it will be too late to stop it.'Perhaps only poetry had the strength to rival the attractions of narcotics, the magnetism of TV, the excitements of sex, or the ecstasies of destruction.'(Saul Bellow)",9,0,0,26 June 2012
The Hunger Games," The Gods demand sacrifice. The Gods are always demanding sacrifice.
","If plain entertainment is your cup of tea and you are in your teens, and if you take lightly to kids killing kids in a game intended for entertainment for the masses, then go for it. Apart from some good acting by the pleasant looking Jennifer Lawrence, whose character development this movie revolves around, there is not much to commend in it. A shaky, inconsistent and incoherent plot, only a couple of good dialogs and jerky action scenes are what characterize it. There are no really good ideas in it, and a couple of very bad ones. The first bad idea is that a contest in which all but one of the participants are killed by the others can be called any sort of 'game' by any stretch of imagination. The correct term is clearly 'war' if the movie is to be taken seriously. (Perhaps in the post- postmodern dystopia words have entirely new meanings, or totally hazy meanings.) The idea that games can be a substitute for war is a good idea, but only if these games are not fatal, or are fatal only exceptionally. The other bad idea is that children are forced by lottery to participate in this death contest (notice that nobody volunteers, and the only exception is also motivated by the desire to save her sister). This is similar to the 'archaic man's' (Jung) worst habits of trying to please the gods by ritual human sacrifices that were almost never voluntary. The popularity of the Hunger Games books and now this movie could be that it stirs that archaic visceral excitement of seeing people being sacrificed as tribute or to please the powers that were presumed to be, so that those powers (gods) give the cult, community or tribe a bountiful harvest so that they don't go 'hungry'. Let me bring some rational balance here by pointing out that these archaic practices did work in exceptions, and only if a powerful person of the community sacrificed something voluntarily with a pure heart and impeccable motive. In all other cases, it was a perverse ritual that had bad consequences for the community, but which was not to be realized by the perpetrators of the ritual. Does watching this movie ring a bell?",6,1,4,18 June 2012
Dead Poets Society," 'The significance and appreciation of every poet and artist is in his relation to the dead poets and artists'. Eliot
","The arts and the sciences are so alienated and estranged from each other in their basic views towards life itself that William Blake remarked 'Art is the tree of life and science is the tree of death' – a statement that was not only prophetic but also so radical and shocking that hardly anyone considered it worth mentioning because science was beginning to take charge of all knowledge that was 'irrefutable' and 'proven'. Art was slowly and surely being relegated to the 'entertainment', or at best 'leisure' category – something to amuse ourselves with, when we were through working hard everyday in unlocking the 'mysteries of the universe' revealed by science. The authority that science enjoys is so high today, that before it, art is made to look almost like an illegitimate activity when it is not confined to entertainment alone. This process continues till this day, and in schools, colleges and universities all over the world the entire emphasis has been placed upon science, technology and commerce. Arts like poetry are as good as dead.In this movie, all the students in the expensive college have been sent by their parents so as to prepare them for a lucrative career for themselves as scientists, engineers, doctors or lawyers. There is thus the intense social pressure on them to do well in their science courses, and to ignore or minimize any time spent or activities related to art or humanities. When Keating is appointed as the new poetry teacher, he finds that he has to use every bit of his talent to generate a genuine interest in his pupils for poetry – which is in his eyes the ultimate human passion and for which life is really worth living.Using unorthodox techniques and settings, Keating manages to generate a spark of passion for poetry in some of his students, who upon being provided the cue by Keating, form a secret Dead Poets Society to pursue their new found interest. Since the very nature of genuine art and poetry is to challenge orthodoxy and conformity, the new found enthusiasm by the students, not tempered with maturity, leads to childish pranks that will lead to trouble with the authorities. The real tragedy occurs when one of the brightest students discovers that his interest and passion lies in the arts – in drama and acting and wants to pursue it, but finds total resistance from his father who wants him to become a doctor, and will not tolerate any disobedience from his son. This is a kind of tragedy that occurs on a colossal scale all over the world everyday when parents force their children to study those areas for which they clearly have no interest and talent. Just the blind rat-race to make lucrative careers for their children, the parents will impose their will even if it ruins the life of the child.The sad but powerful message that is conveyed by the film is that the commerce based system of education throughout the world has killed 'humanity' in its blind pursuit of 'science' and thereby made the 'dead poet' Blake's prophecy come true. The full force of this truth is yet to be witnessed by 'humans', although the scientifically learned will deny this truth even at the moment of death and destruction.",10,0,0,11 September 2012
The Terminator," In the end the Terminator will triumph - that is the real terror of mankind
","The basic plot of the movie is that a highly sophisticated machine (The Terminator) with extraordinary physical powers that also looks like a human on the outside (Schwarzenegger) has been sent from the future to the present so that the machines can terminate the mother of the only person who can save the human species in the final war between humans and machines that rages in the future world. This is being done so that the 'savior of the human species' is never born, and with that done the machines of the future can win easily. The humans of the future come to know of this plan, and so they too send a human into the present time to stop the terminator from carrying out this plan. All the action revolves around this plot, and all the sequences are brilliantly choreographed, along with superb visual effects and dialogs. The role of Schwarzenegger is so perfectly fitting as 'The Terminator', that it is spooky. This has rightly earned him the nickname 'Terminator' of which he too is proud of. It is this spooky feeling that indicates that this is no simple sci-fi action movie, and that there runs beneath the surface theme of man versus machine, a more fundamental theme of life and death, of 'Eros' and 'Thanatos' than just action and adventure, and that is why this is a classic.Coming to the abstract ideas behind the movie, the idea of 'time travel' is now well recognized as purely fictional and therefore serves as an artistic and imaginative prop or support for other ideas. The core abstract idea is that of an ongoing struggle between mankind and the destructive effects of the reckless use of technology, also unleashed by man, which going 'out of control' threatens the entire human species. So this is actually a metaphysical battle taking place within the human mind at the 'collective unconscious' (Jungian term) level. The 'archetypes' of 'savior' and 'terminator' are again props for this battle between those human minds that through their actions and creative expressions support the sustaining force of life, and those human minds that act mechanically and insensitively, and who by their actions support the 'life terminating' or 'death' force.'Our technology has already outstripped our ability to control it.' Gen. Omar Bradley The key fact or the truth that is not apparent is that machines themselves are not players or 'beings' in this struggle, they are not entities that act themselves because they have no 'volition' or 'will' of any kind, rather machines are value neutral tools that are used either to create or to destroy. And since this core abstract idea cannot be presented or explained very explicitly, it has to take the art form of a movie like this one. (Also compare this to The Matrix). Thus 'The Terminator' is a powerful symbol of the ever increasing potential for destruction unleashed by technology that is bound to occur in the future - the event that can only be extended in time ( 'buying time') by the creative use of technology.'Art is a lie that reveals the truth' said Pablo Picasso. And the truth is that The Terminator will ultimately succeed in wiping out mankind because it is 'designed' or 'fated' to do so. This movie buys some more time for us by it's art.",10,2,3,8 July 2012
American History X," Rewrite your history for your own sake.
","The interesting title of this movie supposedly comes from the teacher in the school (Dr Sweeney) who tells his student (Danny) to write an account of his life especially in regard to his relationship with his brother who is a Neo-Nazi Skinhead whom he idolizes and wants to follow in his footsteps. The teacher is telling Danny not to be stuck in the past of others who have made the same disastrous choices but to find for himself whether he is capable of thinking on his own rather than follow the logic and rhetoric of a gang of bigoted Nazis. By writing out his own story, Danny first revisits his past, and finally discovers through the experiences of his brother in prison that indeed he has only been following the prejudiced logic of others, a logic that is fortified into an emotional frenzy of hatred by the archaic rhetoric of people like Hitler, and in this process they have become mere pawns in a game of domination that seems to go on eternally. The whole point of the movie is that this game of domination is a lose-lose game of false or illusory honor or pride in which even the 'king' is eventually forced to commit 'hara-kiri', whereas the pawns, whether on the side of the oppressor or the side of the oppressed who react violently, are either slaughtered or lead a foolish, meaningless life of subservience or futile violent reprisals in which they keep repeating the same mistakes over and over again, learning nothing from their past. So American History with the suffix X (symbolizing the unknown – that is, capable of being reinterpreted without racial prejudice) is the attempt to breakout of this vicious power game, so that something valuable can be learned from History, rather than be trapped in it. The X is also a sort of tribute to Malcolm X who renounced his racism against whites and said that the problem of race was not merely an American problem but a world problem – a problem of humanity (Dr Sweeney's story about dealing with the problem is quite similar to that of Malcolm X's transformation of attitude). This movie is an attempt to deal with this problem by pointing out that this must be dealt with fore-mostly in the educational institutions and that the teachers have a crucial role in this. If this issue is not dealt with at the school level, then it becomes extremely difficult to correct at the later stage of an individual's life as there are no existing institutions that deal with this issue of reforming racial prejudices and attitudes. The turning point in the movie comes when Dr Sweeney posits the key question regarding the problem: 'I didn't get no answers because I was asking the wrong questions. You have to ask the right questions – has anything you have done made your life better?' Yes, everything depends upon the questions that you put to yourself and then honestly try to answer those for your own sake. A near perfect acting by all the leading cast, excellent editing and well researched script that presents all the main arguments on this issue concisely makes this must-watch movie, especially for young people in schools.",10,0,1,19 June 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," Provocative Poetry in Motion Picture evokes questions, questions
","Stanley Kubrick's Magnum opus is a series of interconnected provocative visual metaphors that stir up the human mind so that the most interesting questions emerge out of this cauldron. As I can decipher, the central, most provocative question that emerges is: What is the purpose of life? And more specifically: What is the ultimate human purpose? As Andrei Tarkovsky put it 'The goal of all art is.....to explain to people the reason for their appearance on this planet; or, if not to explain, at least to pose the question'. Kubrick, the wizard of films, accomplishes this admirably in most of his films. To be sure, this may not strike everyone as true, but that is the nature of art – it's target audience is always a select one – even to the extent that some targets are hit harder by that art than it does even its creator, and boy, as a teenager (around 14 then, the timing was so crucial!) I was hit hard by 2001 when I saw it – both in heart and mind. The visions that Kubrick hands down to us are provocative and challenging, and that is exactly how I took it. The first effect of this film is that it mystifies – creates a general sense of mystery and wonder. Only then do you come to the specific mysteries – the concept of evolution is one which is now a hotly debated issue and we are nowhere close to resolving it. Another mystery is that of time - provoked by the images which sometimes seem to slow down so much that time seems to stop (an irritant for so many people), and at then sometimes it accelerates or even jumps at a dizzying speed. One of the key characters, HAL evokes questions like: just what is intelligence? Is it even possible to simulate human like intelligence in machines? The answer to that one is becoming increasing clear: no. The point is that even if we know that AI at the human level is impossible, does not invalidate AI research completely, as A.C.Clarke put it: 'The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible'that's food for thought. Then there is a flood of questions about the relationship between machines and humans that have critical moral and ethical dimensionsbut I'm running out of space here, so I'll close by urging viewers of this film to go over it carefully and articulate questions that address the core nature of us as human beings.",10,0,2,21 May 2012
Pulp Fiction," Look for the signs, the miracles in your life, never dismiss anything as a freak coincidence.
","Is there a theme and message in this crime-action-thriller? Yes there is, and not only is it explicit but also has a subliminal, implicit theme. The theme of noticing, recognizing, and interpreting clues, signs, omens, apparent coincidences, and miraculous happenings and their significances in the choices you then make.There are two distinct, divergent views (and type of persons) on the occurrence of inter-connected events in the world. The first or traditional view is that apart from the mundane, any strange or unusual or inter-connected events are due to super-natural connected causes or divine intervention, and the other is the modern scientific-atheist view that these are merely coincidences, chance, or accidental events and only mistakenly appear to be strangely connected only because they are extremely improbable. According to this latter view, given enough time, even a monkey with a typewriter can eventually produce a Shakespearean tragedy, just as a few basic elements like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen etc., given enough time and all the right conditions (near impossibility), will eventually come together to form a highly complex living organism like a bacteria out of sheer chance...by now you get the picture.In this movie, Jules who is one of the key characters is of the first type, and his partner Vincent is not exactly of the second type but rather the type who doesn't give a damn either way – the kind that never reflects upon any happening. When the 'miracle' happens, Jules immediately recognizes it, whereas Vincent couldn't care less, and so Jules knows that this sign, the omen, the extremely unlikely happening is of direct significance for him and him alone and immediately decides to make a choice – to make a U-turn in his life of crime. That decision empowers him, and when he comes to face another event where he has the choice either to kill or not to kill – he makes the right one.Jules stands redeemed and empowered, but Vincent has learned nothing and meets his fate as a man would who has lived his life 'unconsciously'. Samuel Jackson as Jules stands out as the most intense actor and delivers his lines as a champion boxer going for the knockout punch. The others are really peripheral characters – the ones who fill in the scene to make it more colorful.If this movie makes you more conscious of the unusual happenings in your life and then correctly derive their significance effectively for yourself, rather than dismiss the whole 'miracle of life' as mere chance coincidences, you will have got the message of this film, otherwise its good entertainment only.",9,1,3,23 August 2012
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix is there for you. Challenge it, know and reconstruct yourself.
","It was always going to be difficult to match the brilliance of the first matrix movie, and apart from the high speed shootouts, the rest looks comparatively jaded, along with the acting of all the main characters. My focus, as in the earlier review, will continue to be on the mythology and the ideas about The Matrix in the movie, particularly about the part where Neo reaches the 'mainframe' and meets the 'architect' of the matrix. Firstly the so called 'problem' of choice, which has been fudged in the movie, needs to be sorted out. Let me state at the onset that The Matrix is a deterministic control system, which means that in The Matrix, a broad script of the events of the world have been programmed or 'fated' to happen, without which there would be utter chaos. (Compare with the Greek sub-Matrix of the Gods of Olympus who are constrained by the super-script of the force of necessity 'Ananke', also compare with John C Lily's E.C.C.O.) But within the broad script there is always the scope and the limited 'freedom' for individual human beings to forge their own mini-scripts i.e. make interesting or creative twists and turns. As an analogy imagine you have been asked to play the role of Julius Caesar in a play and you have the choice of either following the script given to you verbatim or make interesting or creative alterations to it. But you don't have the choice of completely changing the character portrayal of Julius Caesar. Coming to the broader context of choice, although the vexing issue of free willed choice versus fate has been pondered for millennia, there is no clarity on it simply because free willed choice happens only in the present instant in reality, so in hindsight may appear to be fated, and because such choices have been the result of the essential nature of the individual who is making the choice. Even beyond that is 'real' choice and that is when the 'free' individual 'creates' an option, that is, does an act that is not determined by past events or has no cause-effect relationship with past events or existing social, cultural norms. The very idea or concept of creativity is that it is something entirely new, not related to or determined by anything in the past. So very few events in world and in the life of an individual are 'real' choices, usually those that happen at critical moments or in crisis situations. But even then micro choices are constantly made by many individuals. For example, as I write this review, I realize that although I may be 'fated' or 'determined' to do this, but the choice of words are 'real' choices only IF I am able to be creative in this, not just making clever permutations and combinations. By this I am bringing to your notice that the prerequisite for 'real' choice is to develop a keen and sharp awareness about how you, IF, and as, an independent, autonomous individual are personally making decisions, even the minor ones, especially by being aware of your motives and intentions behind every act. A tall order? You bet it is. If you take on the challenge, The Matrix is there as an existing edifice (at a superficial level simply the arena of the physical world itself) to make use of as well as scripted to rigorously test you at every step. Always remember, The Matrix is itself value neutral, you have to forge your own values. In the broadest sense, The Matrix runs the script of constructing a scenario in which the forces of sustenance of life is constantly at battle with the forces of destruction, which is what the 'architect' explains to Neo, who also explains that 'the One', the 'Oracle' etc. are basically another level of control. The destructive side has to be, by necessity (Ananke), stronger and therefore will eventually triumph (only in the material sense, not in essence) causing a 'crash' or collapse of The Matrix itself, ending all life, which means the end of the world.",8,0,1,27 May 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Excellent satire on psychiatry – a 'goddamned marvel of modern science'.
","The theme of this movie is centered on the question of what is insanity, and how people identified as insane should be treated. In all societies, an individual deviating beyond a certain point from the norms of that society is considered insane, but even that raises the question as to who in society decides this. In the post-modern world, this power is held by the psychiatrists who 'secularly' and 'scientifically' decide whether a person is sane or not. The sophisticated phrase 'behavior disorder' is used, instead of 'insanity' – and the treatment is very simple – control of behavior by 'commitment to institution' and forcible administration of tranquilizers. More often than not, the end result is opposite; instead of being cured, the patients become worse and at best kept 'stable' on drugs. The basic plot of the movie revolves around this and the blurring lines between sanity and insanity.'In-sanity is better than out-sanity'.(John C. Lilly) McMurphy fakes insanity so that he can avoid the work at the regular prison and take it easy at the institution where he is going to be evaluated, but given his nature - being too cockeyed and overconfident, doesn't know he is landing himself into a trap. Here he meets all kinds of colorful characters – both as fellow inmates as well as the ward nurse who is the most remarkable character because she is so centered on the 'normal' that she is hardly human – more like a cold, ruthless machine, and yet outwardly cordial, a model of 'out-sanity'. It is her cold smile and outwardly pleasant, but relentless by-the-book behavior that provokes McMurphy. This is what sets him on a collision course with nurse Ratched (sounds more like 'wretched') and which will also lead sadly to his own demise.The other main character is Chief Bromden who is noticeable by his size only and hardly seems to be present because he says nothing and does nothing. It seems as if he is an invisible observer. McMurphy is intrigued by him and tries to draw him out, finally he succeeds and finds that Bromden can hear and talk as well, but has been faking it all along. They become friends because both of them realize they are of one kind – those who want to live as they like and who are basically misfits in civilized culture in which there are in-numerable constraints to behavior. When prompted by McMurphy to escape with him, Bromden doesn't want to because he fears he will be 'consumed' by the outside world like his father. 'He did as he pleased. That's why everybody worked on him. I'm not saying they killed him, they just worked on him. The way they are working on you.'When the final confrontation takes place and McMurphy has been turned into a zombie by the authorities because of his violent attack on Ratched; that is when Bromden flips. He finds that the only friend he ever had is 'gone' and that now even the outside world looks like a better proposition than the ward - he finds it better to put McMurphy out of a vegetative and meaningless life and he himself takes flight.. 'In a world where many people have learned to accept a kind of Grey nothingness, to strike an unreal series of poses in order to be considered normal...it's difficult to say who is engaged in the greater conspiracy--the criminal, the soldier(warrior), or us.'

The Shawshank Redemption," No good thing ever dies.
","The greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and articulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her persevere against impossible odds, especially so when he/she is facing a terrible injustice. This reminds me of Viktor Frankl's book 'Man's Search for Meaning' based on his experiences in prison under far worse conditions than depicted in this film. It is only under the harshest and most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being whose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question of the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and the meaning of freedom. The only real freedom that human beings have lies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging circumstances that one faces, and in that creative expression one finds meaning. No one can give that freedom and no one can take away that freedom – its source is within, and completely independent of external circumstances and institutions. All institutions tend to inhibit this freedom and instead 'confine' individuals so that they become 'institutionalized'. The prison is the toughest of all institutions. But the tougher the conditions, the greater is the challenge and if understood that way, the greater the rewards in finding meaning. But until that is accomplished, one must have something essential and substantial to believe in – call it hope or faith or self esteem – in order to survive, for nothing is accomplished in death. At the same time, the idea of death itself is the motivating force – a sense that one could die without having achieved anything in life is the most powerful life sustaining force itself – this is the most stupendous paradox of human existence, something that was hinted at in Joseph Heller's Catch 22. At the centre of this catch is the hope (a word much abused) that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of conditions, that one will be able to forge something good out of the entire BS that surrounds us. And that which is good lasts forever. That is the true faith, not the false faith of the corrupt Warden, who in this case is not only the proverbial 'devil who is fond of quoting from the scriptures' but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a 'man of God' only because of his fanatical devotion to the Bible. The irony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. The ending was the best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated 'Greek Tragedy', as the central message of the film was that hope within one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would have given up, and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between humans, in this case between two very different kind of humans, both by background as well as race, but who become the best of friends because they share something vital deep inside that makes them 'to get busy living' rather than to 'get busy dying'. Finally, what makes this one of the greatest movies is that it also has drama, adventure and action which makes it appealing to a wide audience. For the serious, it can revisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes – a mood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking.",10,1,1,17 June 2012
Blade Runner," Suspect?...How can it not know what it is?
","I had to see this film couple of times before I could figure out the art, the symbolism and the philosophical ideas driving it. The dialogs seem innocuous on the surface, but as you go deeper and go over them from various angles, they turn out to be profound, especially those that take place in Tyrell's office. This is art and intellect at its best. The central theme or idea of the film is based on a very fundamental question: How does one distinguish a 'real' human being from an 'apparent' human being? Precisely what defines 'human' apart from mere bodily appearance and intelligence? In the movie a lie-detector like machine is used to detect the emotional responses of a test subject to determine if that subject has enough empathy to qualify as a human being, failing which he/she is identified as a 'replicant', which in the movie lingo means genetically manufactured pseudo-humans, designed to work 'slave like' in extreme physical conditions that also require intelligence. Naturally, in the context of the plot, all 'self attested humans' consider the replicants as mere machines, and those that do not perform according to their set role, or display rebel like behavior are to be hunted down and 'terminated with extreme prejudice' by the special policemen called 'bladerunners', who are also trained to use the 'empathy test' to detect replicants. It is the untested assumption, amounting to prejudice, that the replicants can never have higher emotions like empathy, love, compassion, value for life other than one's own, etc. The central idea of the movie is that this untested assumption, this 'extreme prejudice' is now going to be tested for all that is its worth, and lots of 'lives', both 'human' and 'replicant' are at stake.and both the human characters as well as the replicant characters will display behavior that is not to be expected, is extremely ironic if the existing assumptions and prejudices are to hold. The other striking aspect I found was a great sense of ironic humor in the dialogs. One example is Tyrell proudly claiming 'More human than human is our motto'. That one made me laugh for a long, long time. Then there is the romance between Deckard and Rachel which also blends well with the central theme, an integral part of the plot and which also gives a sense of completion to the movie in the end. Rather than classify this as science fiction I would classify this film as 'humanities reality', that is, a film that should be considered as one that addresses the most serious human concerns about the slow 'disappearance of the human' (Rick Roderick) in the postmodern world, a world in which 'real' is no longer meaningful and only the commercially manufactured images that sell the most are the only values left. This a one of those few movies that can be watched several times from different perspectives in order to fully appreciate the artistic and intellectual quality of the movie.",8,1,3,23 May 2012
The Matrix," Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see for yourself. And it's going to find you if you really want it to.
","The all around brilliance of this movie comes from the multidimensional themes of art, mythology, intellect and entertainment. It stands out exceptional even in special effects and martial arts, so there is something for everyone in it, and that is why it will remain as an all time classic. My focus in this review will be on the myth of The Matrix, the intellectual ideas and the questions that arise in the plot and the dialogs, and these are as I have formulated them: What is real, and by the same token, what is illusory? What is really behind the complex, seductive, at times apparently chaotic and random, at times apparently precisely timed and connected coincidences of the events and between the people of the world? What controls all the events of the world? Do individuals have any control at all through their choices and decisions over what happens or will happen? Or is it all 'programmed' or 'fated' in a scripted manner? In short, who or what runs the show? Are all our perceptions the result of the cultural construct (the set of perceptual interpretations and beliefs about the world 'taught' into each one of us by our social, cultural 'teachers'), or do we have the freedom to make our perception take flight into new territories, where no one has ventured so far? What are the limits of this freedom and how can we then meaningfully correlate with the existing knowledge matrix (and this movie is itself part of The Matrix) of the now diffuse and globalized culture of this world? These questions have been asked by seers, visionaries and thinkers in all parts of the world for millennia. The answers, descriptions, interpretations provided by these people found in the various myths, are so diverse and different that it's mind boggling to the non-thinker, but quite a challenge to the explorer. Levi Strauss put it this way: 'A theoretically infinite number of versions of the myth will be generated, each slightly different from the others. Myth thus becomes the third dimension of language; in it a continuous attempt is made to reconcile the other two dimensions of language - the diachronic and the synchronic. Because complete reconciliation is impossible, myth grows spiral - wise until the intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted. Myth grows then, because, structurally, the contradiction - the asymmetry – which gives it life cannot be resolved. Different versions are part of the same myth precisely because a myth is not reducible to a single uniform content, but is a dynamic structure. Eventually all the versions of a myth have to be taken into consideration so as its structure can become apparent.' So if any of these questions has ever bothered you, then welcome to The Matrix, the command and control system of the world that is by the necessary order of things, hidden from us for the very simple reason that it must be beyond individual manipulation (yes, the factual flaw in the movie is that the Matrix can be hacked). The only thing that The Matrix will allow is for the determined individual is to have a glimpse or a series of images of itself, but the interpretation of those is only one such interpretation that ideally should have correlation to interpretations that others have given. 'The test of a true myth is that each time you return to it, new insights and interpretations arise' (Starhawk). Good luck to you and hope you 'see' The Matrix, that is, if you really want to.",10,1,2,24 May 2012
