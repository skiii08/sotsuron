The Legend of Bagger Vance," Keep Playing
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is about living. Golf is the medium use to bring the characters out and to be seen. The names do not matter, but they give the depth and reality to the script. Junuh (Matt Damon) being the focal point is a man, any man, that has survived a moment of history that most men would like to forget. The beautiful Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) is the strong woman that is a compliment to any mans life.Junuh existing in the present, and without guidance, can not see the life he has in front of him. Despite the inter actions of the other characters he is lost, and can not find his groove, swing, reason for moving forward in life. He remains bitter and guilty for things that were out of his control and still feels he could have changed things.Bagger Vance (Will Smith) (This has to be the best direction of an actor by Robert Redford. The Fresh Prince in a serious role that is not like himself) comes out of the dark and into the light. This is no angle, this is much more. Hardy Greaves (J. Michael Moncrief as young Hardy and Jack Lemmon narrating and the old Hardy) is the byline to the story and is the person bearing witness to the events that unfold. This movie is not feel good, it is not about golf, it is not about a WWI vet who is depressed about the fact he is alive while others have died. It is about LIVING, it is about humanity, and those that have passed through our lives and we did not pay any attention to them or what they had to say. We all want to be heard but do we want to listen? For those that have read this, revisit the movie and the new title could have been' I saw God as a caddy'. Open your eyes and ears, feel the movie around you, be one with the moment and you to can understand that this movie is far underrated and will, no matter what, be a classic for years to come.",10,0,2,17 March 2008
