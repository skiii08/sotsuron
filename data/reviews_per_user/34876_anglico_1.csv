Blade Runner 2049," I walked out after an hour and half
","Some of the cinematography was good, and a few of the sets, but otherwise I hated it. I wanted it to be good, and I knew it wasn't going to be an action packed cinematic masterpiece, but come on.I just couldn't watch anymore, there was nothing to the story or characters to warrant me staying even longer than I did. They could have cut at least 45 minutes out of this movie and it would have been at least decent.If I had been paid by the hour to watch this movie I still would have left. I have a feeling that this is what they will measure glacier movement with in the near future.",2,10,20,30 October 2017
