Hereditary," Masterpiece. Period.
","If you happen to prefer slasher flicks like Hills Have Eyes or The Texax Chainsaw Massacre, this movie is obviously a total waste of time. On the other hand If you happen to know and appreciate mostly unknown gems like We Go On, A Dark Song or The Autopsy of Jane Doe, no doubt this is definitely a movie for you.If you like neoclassical suspense horror movies where you are required to use your own brain in order to figure it out, go for Hereditary, you won't be diappointed. A true masterpiece. Wicked as Hell!!!-)))",8,2,3,4 January 2019
