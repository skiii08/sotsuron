Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very good but a little disappointed.
","Overall 'The Phantom Menace' was a good movie.  It was however disappointing in the manner that the movie seemed, at times, like a sci-fi soap opera.  There were too many things going on that was trying to be shown that gave it this style.  It is understandable that this was setting up the remainder of the series.  It seems that it could have been done in a way that would have given more of a smooth flow to the story line.The acting in the movie was very good as well as the story line. The movie leaves you with the anticipation of the next episode. To me 'the Phantom Menace' is a movie to see more than one time. Talking with others, there are several things that I did not notice that others did. The same thing applies to them also.If you have not seen the movie, then go see it.  If you have, then go see it again.  You may be surprised what you did not see the first time.  Did you know there are characters from other sci-fi movies in 'The Phantom Menace'?",8,0,0,23 May 1999
The Mummy," A very entertaining movie.
",'The Mummy' is a very entertaining movie.  If you like the Indiana Jones style of movie then you will enjoy this one.  'The Mummy' has scenes that will give you chills and ones that will make you chuckle.  It is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie that you should see.,9,0,0,23 May 1999
