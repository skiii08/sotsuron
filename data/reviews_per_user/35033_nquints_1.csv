Sucker Punch," More than meets the eye
","I had long heard about this flick, which was supposed to be slowly becoming a cult movie since its release, when I finally watched it on TV a week ago. I knew it featured impressive visuals, action and violent scenes, but I had no idea what the plot was about.'Sucker punch' happened to be one of those movies that are aesthetically based on Japanese video-games and aimed at a young male audience. This means: hot girls, weapons, explosions, and a series of challenges. But that was not everything.The plot was actually compelling. There were three reality levels: the 'real' one, where the main characters are locked in a mental hospital; an oniric one, where there is supposed to be a brothel and the main characters are exploited (never visually, though) and a fantastic one that grows out of the latter and where they basically live in an action video game.All in all, I think the movie is interesting and has a hidden message against female abuse. If at the end you don't understand anything, be sure you won't be the only one. But it's worth giving it a thought and finding out what the director wanted to express.",6,1,1,20 April 2016
