Skyfall," Well SKYFALL just fall short.............!!
","Just saw the movie over it's first weekend in India. In much anticipation as I have seen previous bond movies of Craig and liked them for pure BOND charm of it. SkyFall, did not came even nearby to fulfill the expectations. In fact many a times I was in nostalgic mood realizing quite a few OLD Hindi spy flicks with similar scene or setup. In fact SKYFALL was by the book SPY Thriller if we see the script scene by scene. Motorcycle chase,Train-top fighting, a big unnecessary suspense created but did not sustained, Villain with ambition to rule over the world. Only thing which looked different(and every bit force)was the villains escape plan and computer gimmicks added to support it.Villain was impressive and with a decisive laugh or looks same as many Hindi movie like SHAKAAL in SHAAN or MOGAMBO in Mr. India.The only charm I found was the characters and actors who played them so nicely. Thats the only reason to watch SkyFall. The old and new M, Q, Ms.Moneypenny gave it a good touch. Another good part was storyline sticking to the CRAIG's bond movie themes which are exploring personal life and times of BOND than extravagant bond-necessary multi-gadget actions. In fact if I look at the Daniel Craig's BOND movies I feel like the last 3 movies were 'Making of a SPY - James BOND' and at the end of SkyFall, it just confirms the belief.I may have to read many bond books to understand why bond needed to take the war at 'SKYFALL'It left me wanting so much more as if there is a new bond movie coming in just next 6-10 months.",7,4,11,5 November 2012
Inception," Dreams!!! May Come True....................
","The only thing you remember when you watch 'INCEPTION' is INCEPTION itself. I forgot to eat my pop-corn or the drink that was...... And there was a superlative silence in the crowd, quite an unknown fact in a Mumbai theater. As for concept, the movie was sheer brilliance,and awesome. We the Sci-Fi mongoose had chewed on many similar concepts as The 13th Floor, Johnny Mnemonic and The Matrix. You can compare the movie with Matrix on the aspect that both deal with the 'SUBCONSCIOUS'. But Inception gets better as the entire movie is just a subconscious play. We start with a single dream and then we enter the manipulations of 'dream-within-dream'. You also enjoy the mathematical trick played to show the detailed event sequences at each level of the dream, the unstable nature of thought and the laws of physics questionedÂ….Acting-wise each character has it own frames of brilliance with Leonardo of course scoring better than others. Small cameos played by Michael Caine too get noted. You also, have very few but distinct funny moments, like the Kiss trick played on Page.I am by far hooked to Mr. Nolan's movies right from Following-Memento-Insomnia-Batman Begins-The Dark Knight and now Inception. From concept to SFX to the complete film -Inception-is 10/10, no less.I am just awaiting the next thing from Mr. Nolan",8,3,7,26 July 2010
