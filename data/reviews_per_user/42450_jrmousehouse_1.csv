Marie Antoinette," Pretty fluff
","I guess I had no idea what to expect from this movie. Overall it was beautiful collection of scenes put together with little dialogue and lots of color. The movie was indeed amazing to look at, and Kirsten Dunst was a fine actress for the role. The music was great but I had a hard time accepting it as part of this movie. I understand the reason for the anachronism, I especially thought the Converse high top tennis shoes on the floor during her shoe shopping splurge were too over the top for me. I feel like this movie was just one mini clip after another pieced together with big gaps in major parts of her life. I felt like there was something missing. I expected to see more about the capture of the royal family and the events to follow, however, the movie ended before any of that occurred. I will say that if you are not interested in history itself, and you want to see a fun, interesting and excellently filmed pile of fluff, then go see it. Definitely see it on a big screen if you go, it won't be nearly as enjoyable on your TV. Alas, my 10 year old would have loved it without the suggestive scenes, I bet it will be a big hit with the high school crowd.",6,1,1,25 October 2006
