Come and See," Appealing to the Senses!
","'Come and See' was brilliant in that it really had a way of capturing all five of our senses - we could smell the filthy bog, hear the explosions of the bombs dropped by planes, feel the heat from the raging fires, taste the leftover soup from Florya's abandoned house, and see the brutal acts of the Nazi's. By the end of this film, I could only have more sympathy for the victims of this world war, and even far less sympathy towards the Nazi's.My particularly favorite scene would have to have been when Florya continuously shoots the picture of Hitler in an attempt to undo all that has happened under his rule; but is stopped short when we are shown a curious image of Hitler as a baby. At this point, one can only wonder how such an innocent looking baby could be the cause of so much bloodshed and suffering, and if we were in Florya's shoes, could we have pulled the trigger ourselves?",10,2,2,3 August 2009
