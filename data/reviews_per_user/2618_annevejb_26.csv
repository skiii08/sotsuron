The Blair Witch Project," A guess about the politics, v1.01
","Spoilers properly fitted some early drafts of this review due to politics. It is not so relevant now.I understand that this feature was released in 1999; a recently made story by a USA storyteller; using USA resources and personnel and locations.I purchased my Blu-ray as I considered that it was likely to be able to be interpreted as a comment about UK politics of around 1999. I was not disappointed though it took me some musing to realise that I could see parallels that felt real.It helped that I could wait until I found a lower than usual low cost second hand Blu-ray, for this I would not have wanted to pay typical second hand Blu-ray prices. Why pay that much if one is likely to get scared? So, I was purchasing a Blu-ray of something that was mostly filmed in 8mm. Except that is not as pointless as I would have once thought.An example of some detail that stood out for me: The team leader being the one with a map and compass, yet showing symptoms of giving outward indicators of using them properly and results that might come from trusting one's heart rather than what technical indicators say? So, very rarely there might be times when even social outcasts might benefit from that, but to quote Full House series: How rude of me to consider feminist warfare in such terms. Not many might agree with my opinion if I clearly say what it is based on.I expect that this story is more likely to relate to USA politics of circa 1992 to 98 than UK 1999, but why that title for a USA story?",Null,0,2,6 September 2011
Juno," A nice outer wheel. version 1.01
","A rather nice sort of story. Nice to watch, nice to watch again occasionally. I found the third quarter difficult, a need to go to sleep, that is the story development part, but it does include some rather nice bits. The tension felt by Best Friend at the mall, also the mall being the only scene where best friend and new mum can be seen together, also the created disaster re Soup Girl. It is the comparison with the first quarter that makes this part feel weak. Wheels within wheels, I consider that while this is a story that hangs together well, that hidden behind that is maybe a very different story, a modern politics story. As such, Juno would not be alone, there are many, many more. It might even be that such an aspect is not so deliberate, that when the storytellers create a truly magnificent story it will just be incorporating stuff that they accept as sense? If so, just what does the hidden story relate to? I note the mum's wishes re the baby. I note that the baby is a boy. I note that the new mum has a way with males. Madison. One should go Mouldy Peach? One has to make one's own guess re what this story might really be about, but I saw this in the month that I saw mouldy Transformers Revenge and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl and that influenced my current view. At least Juno can stand on its own outer wheels, as can the start of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. As an armchair tourism side issue, the commentary appears to suggest that the story is set in bible belt USA. I find this to be a rather different story than what is usually set there, that it actually gives a positive view of that region.",Null,0,1,27 June 2011
The Devil Wears Prada," Fashion Rules, v1.00
","A fun story. Except that for me the main actor is the fashion, all else is secondary.I was thrown that the story is rooted in reality, someone screaming with horror at their experiences when working at Vogue USA. Questions of ethics. Except that the portrayal of the editor is solid. Backtrack. It is bad, just when watching it I am not thrown by it, the editor is a person of stature. Unless one thinks things through. There are all sorts of things that I would really like to scream in horror about and I do attempt to scream occasionally and my IMDb review of Alexa Vega's Innocent (2009) was such an attempt, it got deleted by IMDb, however. There are standards.The classic feature for ethics problems as Fast Times At Ridgement High as an example and Cameron Crowe's fictionalised biography Almost Famous as background notes.I find the view of dieting as scary and I do not know how real that depiction was. I have been on a calorie controlled diet for a while due to age or something knocking out my previous tendency to skinniness. The dieting in this story talks of an imbalanced diet based on a false identification of what is healthy. I would have expected Vogue articles to be fairly clued up re healthy diet, though I used to skip over the food ones.",Null,0,0,27 February 2016
Divergent," An adaptation that is very okay, v1.00.
","The biggest problem that this film series faces is that it is based on some very long and delicious novels. The Hunger Games series shows that the features can still be okay, but that is not the same as 'delicious'.So I experience Divergent to be very okay. It is an adaptation rather than a straight copy and the two commentaries with my disk do help me see why the adaptations were made. A lot of the film can feel natural, even though such as The Pit is rather different to the book.The film makers / director are / is, not surprisingly, very visually orientated rather than technically orientated and to me this is the root of the main problems that I experience in Divergent the film. To fully experience most features films one has to suspend disbelief, which can take a bit of work. Mostly with Divergent I find it easy to suspend disbelief, but I had not read the novels for about a year prior to my first viewing.With the feature Super 8, the train crash is deliberately visually orientated to an unreal extent and its commentary says why. Divergent: My biggest problem, first viewing, was the zip line ride from the Hancock building. Visuals gone wild at the expense of reality. Try such a ride in even a less windy city would be asking to get smeared on the buildings that are passed. Building such a ride would not be so easy for such a society, either. Yet the novels feel very real in their depictions of the ride. The Abnegation underwear of Tris, a more humorous piece of unreality.There are plenty of other parts of the story where the visuals are too hotted up for my taste, becoming unreal, but to point to them can easily get in the way of appreciation of the film.I get the descriptor 'delicious' from that magnificent second childhood story Ramona And Beezus.",Null,0,1,27 February 2016
She's the Man," Is this an alien plot? version 1.00
","Lows and highs: A powerful comedy with lots of quality comedy detail. A useful (DVD extra) explanation of how this translates from Shakespeare. Not as perfect as Clueless or Mean Girls or Confessions, but the many imperfections are worth shrugging off, to me, anyhow. My DVD includes a trivia track as subtitle two. This does not have a subtly discrete standard subtitles layout but an unsubtle pop up type box in the lower part of the screen. I ended up by translating these into a standard external subtitles file, playable in such as VLC 8.1, though I doubt that will be practical for me to post at IMDb as posting a tidied up version of their full, if slightly anglicised, 250 line Trivia type subtitles is the sort of thing that would need permission from Dreamworks or Lakeshore. My experience of the UK film industry makes me hold off from trying to obtain that. I plan to post my semi-official detailed chapters list for this, in listing and OGG formats. My guess is that such things are typically on the right side of the borderline for posting without asking, a full subtitles set as on the other side. My guess, these days some should not bother to check their guess? The trivia track shows the working title as Dude Looks Like A Lady so maybe Amanda Viola not looking 100% 17ish male might fit well. Viola not looking too much like Sebastian, her twin, is a flaw that I need to work to shrug off, but this situation does not crop up all that often. The DVD background notes show that they put in a lot of work to trying to get them close, but deliberately held back from going as far as possible. That the two assistants who help in boosting Sebastian's image are on the axed soccer team, the two closest female friends of Viola, Kia and Yvonne. There is lots of detail that I did not notice even after loads of viewings of this story. So this is a story that I can give a lot of viewings to, no trouble, and Amanda Bynes is the start of the reasons why, but there is a lot of positive from other actors too. * Bad guys. Viola's ex, Justin, sometimes called Justine by fake Sebastian, and Sebastian's ex, Monique. Something is happening. Late mid teen big bust, Justin and Monique are both pure Klingon of the warrior classification. As a Klingon I have to make some adjustments here. For now I do that by assuming that all those acting the roles of 17ish are victims of the Big Bust problem, just it is showing different faces in the different characters. If it was just those two with Big Bust trouble then it would be lousy typecasting, to me. Assuming that all are showing some of the variety of Big Bust can turn this into feeling useful rather than a flaw. I note the dog theme in Viola's house. The handbag theme in Monique's room. A range of possible interpretations of such symbols. Many point to facets of Big Bust, if not to good and bad ways for being able to grow the skills needed for facing that. Hairspray (2007) shows PP's mum's belief in the desert being good for the soul. Instead I feel a need for healthier ways when dealing with dogs. Union Jack, Amanda and Sebastian both point to this during the early scenes, this story includes a flag of biology lessons and to me that is just a tip of an iceberg.",Null,0,0,24 March 2009
Independence Day," A gripping yarn if meaning is ignored? v1.00
","Emmerich's earlier work, Moon 44 (1990). Low budget visuals but an intelligible story of a clash between two strong industrial groups, the clash happening well away from the legal frameworks on earth. Believable, if scary for a weak male to female. Independence Day (1996) maybe adds extra possible sets of meanings to this. Further, I have a problem with how I interpret possible hidden meaning in this 1996 work. It is earthlings against alien invaders and as an underclass I have occasionally noticed that we are understood by many to be aliens, Klingons, we are often warred against. * Going to other sources to try to amplify my understandings of this can be sense, just I really need to look to biblical sources and I am prone to misunderstand those in a big way. Unfortunately that does not stop me feeling a need to try to interpret in that way. Ancient Hebrew law, that some types of legal penalties should not be permanent for those in the tribes. The Jubilee year. A time of freeing those enslaved. But the biblical histories only note one occurrence of that, and in their later years at that, with a rush to back out and re-enslave those freed. That is a fun thing for underclass to note and write experiences of occasionally as around 1992 to 93 I was noting that sort of thing. By 1996 I was in big trouble again, chained. I assume that other underclass will have had experiences too, freedom then loss of that freedom. For me, Independence Day by Emmerich feels like an expression of how the good among the ancient Hebrew might have felt when the slaves were freed. If that is the case I understand it to totally misunderstand the realities of big babies and other such. It is not an expression of a Klingon view but of an Enterprise view. The weakness of the logic of an earth computer virus on alien machines is obvious to many. But I understand it to likely be intended to be a parallel to one of the main ways that Enterprise culture attacks and forms the underclasses. We are led astray and then mangled badly. This suggests that the underclasses are victims in a war that has always been going on, just the belief systems that have been openly dominant since the eighties have made the result clearer, they are a purer form of natural injustice? The aliens having telepathic control fits what I understand of Enterprise understandings about Klingons, see Wet Hot American Summer. Meantime my Klingons' experiences of Enterprise attacks is of them often being akin to that. To quote Spike in Buffy, such actions by Enterprise or anyone are not without side effects. To me, this telepathic control is not about Klingon reality other than that. Whatever, if I forget about meaning then this is a gripping yarn. Even if it is told by Captain Kirk's side.",Null,1,2,24 August 2009
Twilight," I hope to be following the series, but  , v1.20
","The features in the series reminded me of love-and-war type stories geared to those with a mature taste. The background notes with these suggest that the original novels have a large following among teens, if so they might be teens with a mature taste in reading if the tone of the novels is anything like the features? First viewing, I found the first story, Twilight, to have an immediacy that I usually associate with low brow stuff. The next two as more demanding. The first feature had me wanting to read the novels and the next two made me more cautious; read them, maybe, but no great urgency. I had discovered these features as a follow-on to Push (2009). I felt a need to know more of Dakota's later works and she has a small part in Twilight features 2 to 5. Other Dakota that I purchased included Bees and Charlotte's Web and while those have charm I also experience them as for those with a mature taste, not low brow. Even Charlotte. Coraline, now that is different. I purchased the first three Twilight in the UK Blu ray version as there were second hand copies available at a nearly affordable price. I ended up by getting the final two in Blu-ray as well, but I waited for the second hand prices to drop. So, I find the first story to be an effective lure to follow the rest. I personally find New Moon to have an enhanced lure due to Dakota, though she does not have what I personally experience as a romantic role. An unromantic picture of her is included on my New Moon Blu ray cover. I personally find Eclipse to have an enhanced lure due to Jodelle, though she does not have what I personally experience as a romantic role. An unromantic picture of her is included on my Eclipse Blu ray cover. * The love and war has an sf setting of monsters and people and then more monsters. I prefer not to look into any real world aspects of that as I would then need to side with the vampires but, surprise, surprise, in this story they are sometimes bad guys. In my own world view I prefer to consider our rottenness as mostly a result of wolf pack attacks. That is not the view of this particular set of stories, though the question is raised re what turns people into wolves. What turns people into vampires, this story is just one of many that I tend to consider to be too simplistic. Aliens In The Attic is different and is pleasantly low brow, there is even Ashley Tisdale in a sparkle motion role. The location is a different matter. This is the north western Rockies. The story is set in a very real part of that area, latitude circa central France, and the visuals are made by filming in other parts. Plenty of amazing scenery, but what is the real area around Forks like? For me this is a lure to armchair tourism and I found that the internet and low cost DVDs helped. * I noticed one comment on Twilight that explained the appeal to some as pornography targeted at females. I totally could not agree with that. So, I am male to female, but I was starting to get to know more KS features and then I noticed that the cast includes Christian Serratos as Angela. A few months later, when I watched 1 to 3 again I found that I was noticing Bella and Angela a lot, the features took off and purred. I decided that I needed the Blu-ray of part 4. I find part 4 to be as good as the first story. I had to wait a longish time for the disk to get to close to My Price, but I found it worth the wait. I found part 5 to be even better. I consider the series to be under rated.",Null,0,1,23 May 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Novels and stuff, v1.10
","My comment re Twilight (2008) is about the features in the series, but version 1.00 written before I had read the novels. This is about the features in the series, but written after I have read the novels.I considered the features to be rather highbrow, not what I expected from a best seller. I noticed a user comment that considered the novels to be easy to read and brilliant, very traditional best seller.I now find the novels to have lots and lots of easy to read words, but that a good attention span is needed for them to make sense, Eclipse especially, and such as attention span is something that has been knocked out of me during recent years. Many should have no problem reading these novels. I find the novella, The Short Second Life Of Brie Tanner, to be the easiest to read, though I would have preferred it to have chapters. I enjoyed reading 'Brie'.The novels have chapters but these are not obvious as it is the author and main title that are at the top of the pages. In easy to read books I find chapter headings to not feel so relevant, but if I want to reread particular parts they become useful. Also, as I no longer tend to read a book through all at one sitting, chapters make for handy start stop points.'Brie' is about stuff misquoted in Eclipse feature, likely for storytelling reasons, that is not in Eclipse novel. After my difficulties in reading Eclipse I looked for an audio book version and there is one available to Australians as a download, at a very affordable price for an audio book, but I am the sort to look for lower cost second hand versions and that does not appear to be part of the 'download' market.I have found some very professional sounding You Tube audio books, BreakingDawnReader1, with a male reader for book 2, of 95% of the more approachable Breaking Dawn. I first read the paperback, mostly a chapter at a time, and then listened to the relevant part of the YouTube audio book.I find the features to not be a waste of time, though they are not something that I want to return to often. The novels have so much extra detail that they clarify stuff that I found the features to not convey so well. The biggest example as this being a love story, I found that was obvious in the novels but suspiciously fake in the first three features. In the first three features I interpret the main characters as living in a delusion, but I interpret them from my own lack of success re practical romance.After getting to know all five of the features my view has changed. I rate them all a lot more. I can now accept the romance in the earlier stories.Stephanie Meyer has written something in these that has triggered a lot of echoes in the popular imagination, but this is not a writer that I am likely to follow, except maybe on film.I do not consider J K Rowling to have had a success re features, I am likely to prefer to avoid features of any of her future stuff, but I will be oh so tempted to get to know her future novels, I do find the Harry Potter novels to be delicious. As are the Twilight novels, just they make too many demands on me There are those who appear able to get by okay in the modern world and there are those who get attacked by wolf packs regularly. The Harry Potter features as examples of the results of wolf attacks.",Null,0,4,26 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Blast-ed out, v.00
","A very watchable thriller that held my attention all the way through my first viewing. An okay achievement. I started with Harry Potter in March 2005 and this is nothing like the same, just it was still very watchable.Except that it also feels rather empty to me. Empty of solid Harry Potter 5 content and empty in all sorts of other ways too. So, a story that is very watchable, gripping for the first viewing, while also being remarkably empty. I can easily imagine Ron of the novels watching this sort of thing and coming to such a conclusion.This is the first where I have read the novel beforehand. The feature felt very much like a summary of the novel, with some detail changed in order to allow the summary to flow well. I had expected this, given the previous features. I had not expected this to be a portrayal of the novel and in this particular case this mostly felt to have a worthwhile integrity, despite the emptiness.Further, I was impressed by the quality of the FAQ for this feature at March 2008.I was going to re-watch OOPS HP 5 in May 2010, just before posting this update to my comment. I re-read the novel instead. I do not watch this DVD all that often.",Null,0,2,17 March 2008
"Girl, Interrupted"," A bad case of the SPOILERS
","The trip to the café. Lisa was told that she would never be allowed out again and now I interpret that as a factual statement, maybe literal. A brick in the wall of an Edgar A Poe bricking in. Would Lisa also receive other chains that would be near impossible to break? If so they would not help her to be more sensible and politic, they would make such to be even more difficult for her. Her time off the ward after she drugged a nurse. She mentioned Etc and was on the run, to the sunny US retirement state, dreaming Disneyland professional Cinderella. I assume that she had just received further chains, of the permanent sort. Again, I do not think that they would help her towards a healthy approach. This escape had her robbing someone by way of fake prostitution, then conning an enemy to let her stay the night, which led to a suicide, ham fistedly crushing while also misunderstanding the truth? As she had been crushed by people who missed the point about her? The escape failed. I accept that this is fiction. I assume that the book will show Lisa getting additional chains in different ways. I like the film as it allows glimpses of a sympathetic view of Lisa to be found. If the hidden chainings were visible they might stand out as unreasonable and retrograde, instead it sounds unreasonable to say that they are there. Susanna did meet the real Lisa on the outside, after they had both been discharged. How deeply buried and chained was that Lisa? The real Susanna looks to be still chained. Hurt. * When Susanna returned she became immersed in diary writing as a central therapeutic activity. She also received an unusually large amount of help and supervision from the most qualified person there. After her diary was stolen she did not have a clue re facing the questions of ethics and values that Lisa and the others set her. They were messed up in various ways by the diary, she was sunk by their reactions. The fictional Harriet of Harriet The Spy 1996 faced a parallel challenge and H did even worst. When Susanna left she tried to appease Georgina  Clea, yet the way she did it was smelly. She showed that she still did not have a good understanding of the utility and ethics of journal therapy. She was reacting to the criticism in a way that said poor or chained understanding leading to poor mental health. Chained understanding? Mid teens I was inspired to want to write 'think things through' notes. My ethics made me freeze instead. Hedgehog Ostrich, drifter. Susanna and Georgina froze at different stages. Lisa? I do not know how Susanna's book shows this aspect, but I would be surprised if it was not a real problem. I assume that the note making allowed Susanna a potential for examining her belief system disorders, my private language, even allowing scope for some change of her ways. Her past would have given her massive belief system disorders that I assume I would be able to relate to, I do want to read the book sometime. As well as the notes she needs more tools, even practical permissions to examine and modify her childhood understandings of appropriate good sense. She shows me that she had a shortfall in her toolkit, that the supervision had needed to help her get that more okay. At least she could have done worse. * Madonna. The 2001 video for What It Feels Like For A Girl. In the UK there is the possibility for transgendered with the right medical references to gain the legal rights and responsibilities of our acquired gender. I really had not considered it worthwhile for me to try to gather the appropriate references, as if basic civil rights was likely too expensive. Expensive in all sorts of ways. Health professionals have a much more advanced toolkit, in some ways, than a singer. Not that this Madonna is lacking. What we have in the UK is gender recognition for those who can face the hurdles. What one really needs might include acceptance and tolerance. Lisa and Susanna raise nice questions. * A story of personal relevance, but reading all the comments none covered what this is to me. Drafting a comment was not easy. I needed to simplify by just considering a few issues related to Susanna and Lisa, then a look at a parallel issue. This also links with my previous comments on Matilda 1996, 10-10-06, and Goblet Of Fire 2005, 7-9-06, and Fire On The Amazon 1991, 24-5-06, but they are as long as this. Things like the 'Can You Wag The Dog' aspects are hinted at there. I misuse the term spoiler. Most comments mentioning some detail, I get confused. * These are some of the more recent comments that stood out for me: Amazing true story, 11 October 2006, from Jordan ---- She's a Girl on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, 27 May 2006, from Kentucky ---- Performances by the whole cast (especially Jolie) are all amazing., 8 May 2006, from Scottsdale, Arizona, USA ---- Girl,Interrupted, 16 January 2006, from UK ---- Meaningful..., 3 January 2006, from Houston, Texas Tap into the Psychological, 20 October 2005, from USA ---- Director James Mangold hits a slight interruption of his own, 31 August 2005, from redlands, ca ---- i have noticed some similarities with 'Girl' and 'Cuckoo's Nest'......., 15 July 2005, from USA ---- Very good, 12 June 2005 , from Oxford, England. ---- female 'violence', 22 March 2005, from USA ---- magnificent, 7 February 2005, from Manchester",Null,1,2,27 October 2006
Taken," Travelling in Europe was never like this? V1.00
","My reaction to this was similar to my reaction to Wolf Creek (2005). A very watchable film, but including some really sick sexuality. For those with their feet firmly on the ground as regards to good sexual practice then I assume this can be very acceptable horror, if one has a love of this horror genre. Taken has an even more gripping storyline to Wolf Creek, also a more blatant imagery.Me, when it comes to the portrayal of sexuality I feel on stronger ground with family features such as Aquamarine, fun horror, though features at the quality level of that one are rare. Scary horror can be brilliant too, but I am safer with such as the Scream series, particularly 1 and 4, or Halloween 1 to 5.I am hoping that if I watch this a few times then the problems I get from the sexual violence will calm. They did with Wolf Creek. Could be I should be able to appreciate this action story a whole lot better.A plus. UK news of the problems of young people trying to cross Europe to gain political asylum hint that the sexual horror of Taken does have echoes in reality. I used to find it easy just to accept such news, but without realising the level of horror. I am now glad that I purchased my disk.",Null,0,1,23 August 2016
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Eye opener, v1.00
","I found this to be the most approachable of the five features. I found reading the novel after watching the feature to add to the experience. I found the Youtube audio books by BreakingDawnReader1, etc, to add to that.The dress code of the wolves, at first I found that to be a big let down as it is not explained in the features or the commentary. I am now wondering if it is part of the novels that I have forgotten about. The novel series Animorphs by Katherine Applegate does give a believable explanation in its early episodes and I now import that into my experience of this feature and I can shrug off what used to be a big negative point, to me.I used to experience the romance of the first three features as fake, unreal. After gradually acclimatising to this feature I can now accept the romance in all of the features. I have now watched it through, the full set of features, a few times and found them all to be okay. I needed this feature in order to be able to do that.I found the later features of Kristen to be a problem to me due to her acting style. Riley's and Snow White. This feature has enabled me to overcome that. I can now like them more. I will now be wanting to get more of Kristen's later features.Me rating this feature as 10 out of ten. That is more as a tribute to how it has affected my experience of the series and of Kristen's work.",10,0,9,7 April 2014
Detroit Rock City," Lots of hot music in a putrid setting. V1.01
","To really like this I need to work at it. The walls of the girls' Jericho did not fall until the third session of filming that particular scene, some things take work. There are also two rather special historic commentaries on my DVD and I assume that proper late 70's rock fans are likely to know of those. This is from a time that was not too good from my view, personal disaster, but there was some good rock and roll on the radio. Buying a few, very few, LPs, USA speak albums?, KISS was there. Not the best but among those that stood out as among the best. The classical music that stood out for me included Carmina Burana and I would have interpreted its influence on me in a different way to how this feature uses that piece, for me I was more waving a red rag at bulls that did not appear to be bulls. There is a lot of violence in this story, but other facets too. Round our way most seemed to use more subtle forms of violence on big babies but this does give some variations of that, sort of. I found it easy to get ground down, those years. Some get trouble from all sides. * The commentaries point to KISS having been targeted by some fundamentalist Christians who considered the band to be agents of the devil, their music something that these fun C felt a need to attack. My difficulty is with how the feature interprets that. The feature shows Catholic mothers and priests as agents of the anti KISS. They are very much in parody form. As an ex Catholic I do find the expression to be not in tune with the wide variety in that church. The bits with priests are mostly too way out for me to be able to take, I need to jump over those. The exception as the bit where Beth notices her love going into the church. Inside the church a problem, despite Beth's acting. There are several features where I would really need a personalised copy and this is one of them. I need deletions. The Catholic mothers, particularly the mum of Jeremiah, a different thing. First time round that felt way too bad but that reaction soon calmed. More viewings also allowed me to notice how her idea of child care appeared to be influenced by ways of dealing with a pet dog. Not a warm sort of way as with Hermione and her Crookshanks, more a Ron with Pig as shown in the novels. Pig expected to do things on a Must Do basis, otherwise no love. This is parody, but it could be noticing something rather relevant in some of the fundamentalist Christian worlds. I find that it is there in other worlds too but maybe one only notices if one is a big baby. I would expect Harry and Ron to not survive well in the modern world and JK Rowling and Warner do have ways of saying that. The ending of HP7 novel is very modern speak. So, some fundamentalists attack and this feature shows a response by the Rockies, them attacking back, but doing that in an upside down way. By going with the flow of trying to sound evil? By these four fans waving goodbye to most any sort of sense? The world moves away from fundamentalist understandings about such as the ten commandments and this shows everyone diving into disease as the alternative way? So, this is just a feature, one that took me some getting used to. It is not about reality in the fullest sense? Could be that in any type of fundamentalist belief there is a failure mode of there being no leeway. Believe, no other option, no freedom to think. If one feels a longing to drop out there can be no good way to do so. Most characters in this story remind me of that sort of thing. There will be different interpretations, though. * This feature has lots of good music on the soundtrack. I play it because of that. Just I do experience a problem with the foreground, most scenes that include priests, and deletions are the only solution that would be liable to work for me. This is a story about the walking dead, KISS as a setting for that.",Null,0,0,10 August 2009
Les Misérables," Christmas Eve, 2014, v1.00
","I purchased my blu-ray because of Mama Mia, no other reason. If it was anything like I would be wanting to watch it on Christmas Eve and on every other day for the next few days. It would have been the highlight of the holiday season.I found Mama Mia via the serendipity method, an ultra low cost second hand DVD. I was soon needing to purchase a blu-ray, again low cost second hand, and went straight to the blu version of this, again low cost second hand, despite blu being less easy to play.So I watched it the once, but as is I am holding back from re-watching it for a few days. To me it is more akin to Evita than Mama Mia. Evita, first viewing I switched off before 15 minutes were up. I eventually went back for a second viewing and by now I rate it as a quality feature film version of an opera, one that can grab me all the way through. For me, it does not have the immediacy and fun appeal of the musical Mama Mia. It is just a different beasty.For Christmas I re-watched my recently acquired blu of Selena Gomez's Getaway.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Alternative versions of 4?
","This contains spoilers: I object to The Princess Hermione being scripted as a nag. I have only read the five most recent pages of comments. Magic. What I have read is for and against. Some see massive flaws in loved stories. To others these are brilliant and true to the feel of good stories as they know good to be. To me, these are captivating films, but also captured works. I understand these stories and my perception to have been tied up by something akin to He Who Must Not Be Michael Gerber. That is the only explanation that I have for the flaws. Disaster. How Dumbledore's ways feel tied up in HP 4, TGOF, not in TPOA, so as to have the music taken away, a Bumble-door prune. How Princess Hermione The Great is scripted as an old nag and Emma liking it so. How the scenes between the lake and the maze miss out on a build up of plot. How the final curtains talk makes me think that Vol-De-Morgue has already won. How I got scared of HP 5 before it appears. Has J K been imprisoned too? I understand that the feminist revolution was effective for that sort of situation, women having been tied up for thousands of years. However I understand the solution to have been effective for effective women, men too, but criminalising for the weak or dented. Used to be I had qualms re witchcraft stories. For me to openly and effectively say that I feel the need for some sort of SPEW, I am living dangerously. When faced with a fool there are many who start slithering. I am also at risk of big trouble from the cures. Then I read the book. I like it that the films never wobble the same as the book. My first viewing of 4 after that was wow. That happened as I drafted this as well. Magic. The books read as by someone with reasonable skills in knowing sensible and practical ways to live life, effective legs. For me the films are maybe by people who are more down to earth, living in worlds with different rules. I obviously guess things wrong a lot, I am from a different world, but that explains the differences to me. The paperback I have has cover blurb that this is a darker story than the others. Advertising words now true for the film but I cannot accept them of the book. HP 4 sets a tone of why this is a path that Harry and co need to follow for the Vol-De-Mod situation to be properly appeased. It shines as the most optimistic of these four. I would really like it if Columbus returned for HP 7. For 7 to be two or three or four films, a Beat-Oven finale. My hope partly comes from his treatment of The One Who Flows, Hermione Nose. Ron had his Scabbers, I show error correction symptoms by knowing that I would like the role of a trans lesbian Crookshanks for the Granger of HP 1 and 2, even 3. One of many Hippogryff dances, curse or blessing. Crookshanks can mean many different things. Bent lower legs. Bent as a natural for Slytherin. Having been bent and trying to get by. This leads to Dumbledore 4 and physical contact: A Vol-die view, an inept old woman, not an inept pet. I assume a New Ell statement. Dumbledore 3's physical contact with Ron was not Old Woman and Cuarón revelled in a potentially lethal approach to contact by Her with Malfoy. The New Ell petrifies Harry in his bath, transforms Dumb and Gran-her and creates a Who Done It. Who would notice? Will there be alternative versions available from the cutting room floor? New Ell is day to day reality. I notice hints of this triggering some sort of war; against Newell, against some of the actors. I like the concept of an alternate version as it could work to try to calm this. I am likely being unreal. The HP series has had such as Cuarón and Doyle willing to take part. To me, SPEW is wondering what is needed to be supportive to making their works fly. Put like that a fan can feel powerless, but a fan can note what happens when these fly. If it is an impossible question then at least there is a fan question there. A need to be in tune with SPEW that points in the right direction, in an okay way. Hippogriff dances need not be fire gobs. With Tinker Belle it was simply stated: I Do Believe In Fairies, I Do I Do. Would that Leavesden Castle was just full of wannabe fairies in need of a safe world for making their films in. But this is a world where many are happy to express a disbelief in the fairy worlds. Or only to express belief for the deserving. My last posting, for Nearly No Christmas, had a problem re automatic error correction of spelling mistakes. I wrote p re-school and what came out on the IMDb comment page is Prue-school. I had hoped to put some non standard smelling into this wannabe SPEW. At least the automatics should recognise Hogwarts. * While I do not agree with these, they stood out for me:Poor omnium-gatherum of bad directing-work, 27 August 2006 If you haven't seen this movie, this review will HELP you decide., 9 August 2006 Utterly fantastic!!, 16 July 2006 Pretty good, 11 July 2006 Very Good, 4 July 2006 A great story was killed...Wanted for murder:Mike Newell, 28 June 2006 Captivatingly visual, 9 June 2006",Null,0,2,7 September 2006
Zombieland," Twinkies, v1.01
","I found this by searching for features by Abigail Breslin, Emma Stone was a big additional plus. A fun, watchable zombie story.The story also set me to searching for Twinkies, a piece of USA culture that occurs frequently in stories and discovering that they are vegetarian and at my local supermarket allowed me to find out that they are something that I personally prefer to avoid. That also led me to wondering about Fat Cakes as in iCarly and the real world equivalents I found were totally brilliant, until I discovered that some were not vegetarian, but some are.The Abigail character rates 'Hannah Montana' a lot, so I followed that through but did not find the series as watch-able. Miley Cyrus features are better and I rate 'So Undercover' (2012) Other zombie stuff I have seen recently includes Warm Bodies, very different but equally memorable.",10,1,2,27 September 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Hitler was a vegetarian, version 1.30
","amended: 30 July 07 and 2 Aug 07 and 6 Aug 07 and 5 Nov 2007 etc * This contains SPOILERS of the musing about plot elements type. * This and Philosopher's Stone are special to me. Part of that comes from the length of the novels allowing these to follow the books more closely. The special magic that Columbus was allowed to breath and form life to. Even more relevant is that here The One True Princess, Hermione The Great, is not fully at big girl level. To many it would not be obvious at all that this makes these two to be very special indeed. How could anyone with clean and pure sense find big girls to be almost as daunting as women? * Ginny: One detail that stands out for me is the look of Ginny. The background notes show her, in real life, to be a classically beautiful female. I assume that is just her being herself, yet through all the features I have seen so far she mostly looks like Harry's mum, and not such a pretty imitation. The novels that I have so far do not show them to be obviously related. For me, Harry 5 will be special because it is the last before she is what I think of as a young woman, no longer a girl. A need to go myopic and ignore that she is a big girl in HP5. I have not noticed any mention of her in the 40 IMDb comments that I browsed re HP5, but I would expect her to again be looking like Harry's mum. Hope that the background videos continue to be different. That is how I experienced Ginny before I wrote this comment. Magic. Now her reality has changed for me and Harry Potter is no longer the same. * Hermione and the torn page: I note that the novel has this too, and JK makes a mention of library defence spells in the introduction of Quidditch Through The Ages, useful for considering the storyline of HP2. Yet I cannot envisage Hermione as being able to deface a book in this way. Maybe Imperious might be powerful and devious enough to over-ride her feelings. Whatever, the fictional event did take place. I consider JK to typically have an unusually good grounding in common sense so there is always a chance that I misunderstand. Theft of potions ingredients? Bulstrode  pussy  Crookshanks? More hangmen? * Ron's wand: Flying into Hogwarts at the start of the year broke one or two rules of the school, also of the state, also of Ron's family, also of etc. The extenuating circumstances feel rather weak if Dobby's influence is not taken into account. The car developed engine and steering trouble as soon as it got close to the school. They headed straight into the most obvious tree to avoid. Ron's wand somehow got broken during some rather inept attempts to find a use for it. They then had to face Filch and then Snape. Could be that there is still hope for Ron. Hagrid's wand was supposed to have been broken after a court upheld Voldemorte's allegations, but Ron's wand says that Hagrid's wand does not show symptoms that might be expected. * Slytherin and his heir, Voldemorte: Both of these had no qualms about using a girl's toilet, to the extent that something important, the gateway, could be hidden there to eventually be found by the heir, it not considered as an obvious locale by most anyone else. As a male to female I have a problem re this. I find it normal for me to be put to the test until I eventually fail the test re most everything, considered to have a special odour as a result, sometimes the odour even being real. Strong pressures that can easily corrupt us, gargoyle formation, that and natural accounting giving the impression that we are pure evil type corrupt. Motivation to effectively corrupt us further, two biblical tombs, curse or blessing. Invasion of our being and of our being space, a theft deeper than the theft of potions. Compare with Fame 1980. This aspect strongly hints that these two are secret girls and the secret and not so secret do have a bad enough press-press already. Englander humour: Brownsea Island nature reserve. Still, Hitler was a vegetarian and no one messes up veggies because of that. Eye of newt and wing of bat. * This links with my comments on All American Girl of 1994 and Fame 1980.My comment in this re Slytherin and his heir, Voldemorte, had an overflow comment at the Harry Potter 2 message board re The Chamber's Location Question?, except it has disappeared. But HP7 novel makes it not relevant anyhow. For further aspects I used the message board under the same heading as this, 'Hitler was a vegetarian', just that disappeared too. Again, it is stuff that is no longer relevant apart from an attempt at listing such as scarf colours and proper spelling of key names. I do need a pointer to a fan site that has a collection of stuff like that.",Null,1,2,23 July 2007
A Hard Day's Night," At least the music is hot, version 1.00
","What is highly regarded as a classic, yet now I just notice how it reflects how easy to lead big babies are dealt with. To me the story is tragedy. It is a classic in showing the worst side of good people. The big musicians and storytellers of the sixties were only people, after all. Except that many do not consider such as bad.The many background notes on the DVD. These were also showing me that this was from the early sixties, that several of the actors involved had chains in their beings from the Victorian culture that was loosing political power. What size people lived in those early primitive cultures? The challenge for me is how to appreciate the positive that is also there.To really like this feature I would need to trim it a lot. I would need the story to be on the cutting room floor, I consider it to contain too much disease. I would need the music and the visuals that accompany the music. Would modern understandings of digital copyright consider such to be improper?",Null,0,1,2 April 2009
The Big Short," For me this was essential viewing about the modern world, v1.00
","Search for recent films with Selena Gomez and one finds such as this. She is only in them for a minute, a disappointingly short time, but in this the appearance is okay. She plays herself trying to explain one of the mechanisms behind the 2008 USA and worldwide financial disaster, and the setting for that example is the betting games at Las Vegas.While that financial crash was happening I was too tied up by the UK Blair Witch period to be able to access news, so I only knew about the crash by prices starting to rise and supermarkets starting to move stuff around a lot, which as a way to put off supermarket customers seems effective, just I assume that it is done to advertise their stock range and to try to get more income? When UK Tory politicians blamed the crash on the previous Labour government I had no basis, other than suspicion, for questioning that.The Big Short tells me things about the recent world and communicates better than a serious technical work would have done. I needed this.'Citizenfour' (2014), does does the same about a period when I was starting to be able to access the news. It adds more detail about how the modern world works.Look to the 2017 UK world, Brexit, these both help me to understand and appreciate that, though it would need additional features to give an explanation of how the left and right have gotten tied up by their equivalents of Blair Witch.News in September 2015 of unusually high UK levels of unsecured debt due to poverty and Brexit suggesting that a financial crash might be imminent in the UK, it is The Big Short that supplies the alarm bells for that.",10,0,1,27 September 2017

My French is not up to being able to follow the soundtrack, I need the subs, but it was still easy to appreciate why this gets such a reception here. * I have a UK version DVD, which does not include such as the deleted scenes but does include an English language commentary by the director. This explains such as how the story was built up, from various experiences that had happened to him, from various experiences that he has heard of. It covers some experiences about making the film. It covers some reactions to this feature. The story happens at an unusual period in French history. The death of Di, pron La De De. How this links with the story is partly alluded to, but a lot is not said, as if that was not the real issue. Part of the commentary, the reactions of politicians, make me assume that I am misinterpreting there, that I do not know this feature well enough yet, that this is very much about that period while being not just about then. * Further, this does encourage one to wash one's food properly, even the pulses and grain.",Null,1,6,15 November 2007

Most of the stuff I have with Aly Michalka is not what I can rate as exceptionally good, but I still try to watch her other work and I discovered this. Aly's role is not so hot in this, she is not the good guy, but she does help along a film that really stands out and the IMDb rating of 7.1 suggests that for once there are a few others who agree on that.Add Amanda Bynes of She's The Man and LaLaine of Lizzie McGuire, even Penn Badgley of Gossip Girl.

Apollo 13," New York World Trade Site, Winter Gardens
","I find this difficult to write, as I experience the feature to be an attack against an individual, where I had hoped it to be other. I searched out my copy of the DVD as it is an Emily Ann Lloyd, companion to Annie and Molly in Annie 2, which is also of 1995. She is age 10ish and playing the younger daughter. Discover it to be a well crafted story about the Apollo disaster, with lots of Apollo stuff in it, then it gained massively in potential power. The extras in the DVD gave a lot of additional stuff that still makes the package worthwhile to me. In all sorts of ways this feature is magnificent and perfection. Except the feature itself appears to crash this aspect, deliberately, by making a smattering of technical detail to be askew. The most positive part, for me, is how people in mission control are shown. The filmmaker demonstrates very real skills at portraying the feel of most of the situation, Grumman?, as if he has a real in-tune-ness with the people there. A remarkable achievement, but that became scuppered. In some ways this feature is still so nice that when I watch it I typically have to shrug off the disaster of the deliberate flaws. * I personally interpret this to be triggered by a culture clash and a personality clash. Different understandings about taboo. From that there is a demonstration of how today's dominant intolerance ethos turns things into a hatchet job. It should be easy to interpret my reaction as an over-reaction. It can be dismissed. Downer that Emily got serendipitied into this feature. I understand her as a girl with very typical growing up hurdles to have to try to face. Someone who got channelled into features that highlighted parts of that until the year 2000, age 16ish, when her last feature was released. Oh to be serendipitied along channels that solve our hurdle challenges instead.",Null,0,4,13 October 2008
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Discovering Kristen, v1.10
","For me, Twilight series is easy to under-appreciate.My comment re Twilight 1 relates to the movie series and my comment re Twilight 2 relates more to my experiences of the novels. This relates to the movie series leading to me discovering Kristen as an actress.I discovered the Twilight Saga because some episodes include Dakota.A lot of Kristen's stuff is available in affordable, to me, second hand copies and that allowed me to spend several months getting to know her other stuff. It includes a lot that is really okay.Eclipse commentary mentions a film that K S and Jodelle Ferland had both acted in. I had to try to get that and it was available as a relatively low cost second hand blu-ray. K S has the lead and I found this to be one of her best movies. I preferred it to Twilight Saga 1, but now consider them both to be good but different.This made me discover more and I found that I already had two on DVD, features that I had considered as memorable. K S was starting to seem to be rather hot. It was definitely not my early reaction to the Twilight series that showed me that but The Messengers and Panic Room and Zathura.The other stories seem to mostly have some common elements, with the possible exception of Jumper, where K S appears at the end in a minimal role, as if a cameo appearance. Of these I currently prefer Fierce People and The Safety Of Objects and Cold Creek Manor and Mission Without Permission and In The Land Of Women and The Cake Eaters and Snow White And The Huntsman, but that is just personal taste. Also the difficult Adventureland and The Runaways, easy to follow stories that pose difficult questions re how a storyteller needs to describe real realities.",Null,1,2,29 January 2012
The Runaways," The Big Country (1958) and a chainsaw massacre, v1.10
","Spoilers as this gives my interpretation of some aspects of the story. Can spoil things, maybe, maybe not. Getting to know this disk better allows me to notice the music more and more so I am rather glad that I purchased the Blu-ray, even though the price had not dropped to My Price at that time. The story starts a few years before the story of Detroit Rock City (1999), which includes a memorable Runaways song in the scene where three guys go a.w.o.l. from their school. School Days, written by Kim Fowley and Joan Jett. A blatant aspect of Detroit Rock City is the violence and this does include interesting hidden comments on that. Kim as the manager of both The Runaways and KISS. * The band was a bunch of new musicians and the story shows something positive here, but sick too. A well worn phrase that rock musicians grow up fast on the road takes on a bitter edge. Their main on-stage front guy as Cherie and the story shows her to have some fairly commonplace teen problems and weaknesses that really need effective help if the individual is to be able to stand on their own feet in an okay way. Myself, I was a non-starter in that. Cherie faced a lot more years of trouble than one would really hope would be needed. Indicators are that things have not improved since then. Compare the book and film versions of Girl, Interrupted or Harry Potter. Cherie got what Rowling's works got. Meantime, manager Kim having grown up versions, teen stuff escalated, of a male thing that Detroit Rock City suggests might have been commonplace in the USA of that time. Indicators are that things have not improved since then. This screen story is scripted in a way that highlights and underlines how Kim affected Cherie. Those who have followed these people for a long time will know a lot of additional detail, but background notes on the disk show that real historic situations were rewritten and sharpened in order to show more clearly how Cherie was damaged by this. Kim as the power hungry bad guy who was so obviously bad, in some ways. Me, I need to add a mental footnote that he was a victim too. This story is a neat illustration of how those perceived to be flawed can get crucified. Cherie, but also Kim. And the modern world moves on. Scary, scary night? Dakota – Cherie sometimes shows real beauty, but typically this beauty is only at the groin, another toy of Dr Frankenstein. It is less obvious that Kim is also a doll. I first noticed this feature via a magasine photo of Dakota and Kristen, Dakota in an amazingly attractive frock and I knew that I needed to see this feature just because of that frock. That frock is not in this feature, just a beautiful groin tacked onto a wreck. * Drafting this I re-watched The Big Country (1958) and it feels to have a relevance, even though any parallels are lop-sided. I am also reminded of High Noon (1952), but that is the chainsaw side rather than how I understand the wider picture. The chainsaw is quality. I am also reminded of Skins season 5 episode 5, Nick. Cherie had some massively damaging experiences and the feature shows her trying to face them honestly. She is not running away from key issues. * As this feature really did allow me to like their music I followed through by purchasing two dvds and two music compilation sets. My big mistake was purchasing Edgeplay, a documentary made by their last ever bass guitar player. Joan chose to not be involved with this and she blocked access to Runaways music that she had written. I found that Edgeplay did include a lot of additional historic detail, a mix of real and maybe real anecdotes, but that it worked to stop me liking their music. The Runaways feature showed a mess but allowed me to really like the music side, this worked to knock that out, what it does show is a much greater mess. Television clips from Japan are included, but these do not compare well with the scripted on stage parts in the feature. Some people like Edgeplay, me no. The second DVD was Joan Jett Live, from the same period as Edgeplay. Watch that alone I would have loved the music and considered Joan to have grown through a lot of different visual styles. The CD compilations were Joan Jett And The Blackhearts Greatest Hits and The Runaways Mercury Albums Anthology. Before I saw Edgeplay I found these to be just what I hoped from the feature. Anthology includes several pics, mostly of messed up female musicians but including the cover pics of the albums, too. Anthology also has all of the tracks except for some of the Live In Japan tracks. Many are written by Jett and Fowley.",Null,0,1,29 January 2012
Donnie Darko," Re Sparkle Motion v1.32
","I discovered Donnie by knowing that it included Daveigh. This tries to link together detail from the Donnie Darko disks, together with assorted IMDb files, in order to identify who Sparkle Motion are and other parts where they contributed to the film. This is not comprehensive, but covers the main bits. * Some background: High School Musical's Ashley Tinsdale has a non musical role in this, Dorky (Kim, brunette). Here she is actual high school age. DC soundtrack - ntsc-1:06:58_pal-1:04:14 – ntsc-0:58:08_pal-0:55:46 in the shorter version, speaking at Jim's presentation - Hi. My stepsister, like, I sometimes worry that she eats too much. – Joanie and Beth are on screen too. Except, who is that sitting next to Cherita in Donnie's English class? This is very early Tisdale and she is not just in one scene. The Blu-ray version helped me to notice that, but mine lacks the promos of Killing Moon and Mad World that are a highlight of the DC DVD two disk set. * From the DC version Production Notes video, filming of the main Sparkle performance was on 27th July 2000, 24 days to go. From IMDb trivia and box office, filming started on Daveigh's birthday and ended on August 31st after 28 working days. I consider Sparkle Motion as actors rather than dancers. They play a special role in the film. The choreography will be a relevant statement. Their early practice session is a lead in to us being shown The Destructors, such as Donnie asleep on the golf course as an extension of the lead in. This exercise helps the dance to dance for me. I had expected to rate Daveigh for song and dance but for me her website in 2006 gave the wrong examples and for me the competition from LiLo at the end of Life Size is too hot. And that Greene too, that Greene is a killer. * From the D C soundtrack - ntsc-1:24:00_pal-1:20:40 - ntsc-1:11:30_pal-1:08:35 in the shorter version, intro to the performance - Now the moment we've all been waiting for. It is my pleasure to introduce to you Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey, Samantha Darko, Beth Farmer and Joanie James. They are Sparkle Motion. From the cast list and biog files: Daveigh Chase plays Samantha Darko - Date of birth 24 July 1990 of Las Vegas, USA Jazzie Mahannah plays Joanie James Tiler Peck plays Beth Farmer - Date of birth 12 January 1989 of California, USA Marina Malota plays Emily Bates - Date of birth 7 February 1987 of Burbank, USA Carly Naples plays Suzy Bailey Also: Kristina Malota, sister of Marina, plays Susie Bates, sister of Emily, pics say younger sister. Beth Grant plays Kitty Farmer, mother of Beth, possible joke?, and also the teacher cum Sparkle organiser who teaches Jim's stuff. Daveigh and Marina have both acted in several films. Carly and Tiler and Jazzie have done some too. Simpler to check their IMDb listings than write them here. * Visuals: Samantha and Joanie are clearly labelled in the soundtrack so taken as read here.

The Wizard of Oz," This Feature Is, v2.01
","A story that scared me 55 years ago, around age four, but not as much as Peter Pan scared me. A story that I enjoyed during a school holiday, aged around 9, around 50 years ago. I now find that I could watch the budget DVD version, a triplet with Singin In The Rain and High Society, without going to sleep, that it held my attention better than most, even better than many recent features and the standard has improved massively since 1939. An unusual film. Interesting that Judy Garland, age sixteen, reminded me of Ashley Johnson, age ten. * Early 2008 I found an affordable copy of Easter Parade 1948. I know this is rated as a classic, but not many of these early ones that I used to rate a lot still have the fascination that they once had for me. This is one of the exceptions. A big plus for me is the commentary, by Ava Astaire McKenzie, Fred's daughter, and John Fricke, Judy's biographer. It brings out the warmth in the feature. It is supportive to this feature being one of the exceptions. I start to wonder if I should be a Judy Garland fan. The background notes for Oz put me off, but this swings things around. * April 2008, I try a search for affordable early Garland and the little that was there was rather high priced by my standards. A bit later I try an Amazon search and found Love Finds Andy Hardy 1938, Judy at age 15, shortly before Oz, but playing a12. A story with several strands so it is easy to not notice that Judy maybe has the second most important slot as regards screen time. I feel drawn to enjoying it and to considering it as an unusually interesting feature for that epoch. Early Garland seems yes, if and when available.",Null,2,2,30 July 2007
