First Man," Glad I saw it for free
","Saw the movie last night at an invitation only preview. Numerous gross technical errors aside, the endless shaking of the camera makes the viewer nauseous. The storyline is shallow and feels like a series of disjointed scenes pasted together. It is not clear why several of them were included. Given how long the movie is the character development was incomplete. Very disappointed as this could have been so much more.",1,56,153,7 October 2018
