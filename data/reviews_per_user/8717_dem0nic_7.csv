Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Awful
","I wasn't too impressed with the first half of Kill Bill but at least I managed to watch it right through.  After 40 minutes of Kill Bill 2 I left the cinema, it really is that bad. .Every scene dragged, this movie is padded to fill the running time.  What was the point of Michael Madsens character visiting his workplace? That dull scene took up about 10 minutes and the only thing it accomplished was showing Madsen get laid off for the next 4 days..but at the end of the day this movie is directed by Tarantino, so I'll go with the trend and award it 10/10.",1,21,41,5 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," the worst half-a-movie I've seen
","I wasn't a big fan of Volume 1 but a few reviewers seemed to think Vol 2 was a return to form for Tarantino; I have to disagree with them!Uma Thurman continues with the same wooden, unconvincing acting on display in Vol 1, only this time there's a whole lot more of the forced, cheesy dialogue that tries really hard to sound cool and fails miserably. 
Tarantino continues in full swing with his tributes to classics such as Leone's Westerns.  The first time Uma comes face-to-face with Carradine it cuts to an overlong showdown effect, why?  It works in a western whilst you're waiting to see who makes the first move, but it's completely unnecessary in this Kill Bill scene.I stopped watching this when Uma manages to punch her way out of a coffin from 6ft under, it truly is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and is very had to believe its from the same director as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction!1/10",1,5,10,12 July 2004
Underworld," One of this years better action films!
","Despite being about Vampires Vs Werewolves the plot was taken seriously and panned out well.  Watching it straight after Tarantinos latest Kill Bill, Id say this was easily the better movie of the night!Kate Beckinsdale looked so damn nice in leather too! ;)",10,1,2,18 October 2003
The Transporter," Diesel move over, Statham is the next action hero!
","Apart from Snatch I've never really liked Statham in anything so wasn't expecting much from the Transporter.  How wrong I was!Statham plays the action hero perfectly, he looked as talented as Jet Li in this movie!  There's loads of action, in fact its one of the best action movies I've seen since taking a chance on an unknown movie called 'Drive'I'm now actually looking forward to Stathams next movie!",10,0,1,15 May 2003
Hellboy," Ron Perlman is perfect, the movie is not!
","Ron Perlman delivers a great performance as Hellboy, so it's a shame this movie is average at best.It's got loads of CGI effects but very little else. Parts of the movie just annoyed me, take for example when the young FBI agent gets to see his first mutant, why is he not shocked??  Overall I enjoyed it more than Daredevil & Hulk  but thats not saying much as this was just another case of Style over Substance in the latest of superhero cash-ins.I'd probably give it about... 5/10",6,0,1,15 April 2004
Donnie Darko," AWFUL!!
","The only way you will understand the plot is to read the Time Travel Book in the extras on the DVD.  I bet nobody guessed near the rubbish the plot actually is....
---------- THE TRUE PLOT OF DONNIE DARKO (spoiler) ----------If a Tangent Universe occurs, it will be highly unstable, sustaining itself for no longer than several weeks.  Artifacts provide the first sign that a Tangent Universe has occurred.  The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the Artifact into position for it's journey back to the Primary Universe.  The Manipulated Dead will manipulate the Living Receiver using the Fourth Dimensional Construct.We enter the Tangent Universe when the Airplane Engine (Artifact) first appears.Donnie (Living Receiver) has been chosen to guide the Airplane Engine back to the Primary Universe. We don't know why he is chosen.
Frank (Manipulative Dead) dies in this Tangent Universe so he is able to guide Donnie to get the Artifact in position.---------- THE TRUE PLOT OF DONNIE DARKO (spoiler) ----------
This Plot isn't intelligent. Creating a movie nobody would ever understand (unless its explained in a book) is not hard to do.  This film is the dullest, most over-rated rubbish I've watched!",1,171,346,6 April 2003
Donnie Darko," Terrible!
","Its a shame this movie didn't get a proper cinema release, if it had it wouldn't appear in the Top 250!The only way to truly understand the plot is to read the 'Time Travel' book bundled in the DVDs Special Features!! (how poor is that!) This easily clears everything up and reveals the plot.  Is that Clever?  Not really because anyone can write a story that nobody would understand unless having it explained to them.Dismal, Dull, Darko.  1/10",1,20,40,23 December 2003
