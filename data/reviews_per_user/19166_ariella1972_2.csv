Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Did people who gave 10 stars actually watch this?
","I LOVED the first Sherlock with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. They had such chemistry and fun with suspense and mystery that I was dying to see the sequel.As great as they were in the first, they were that bad in the second. It was like watching two amateur actors. Of course, the writing wasn't much to work with. One would think, being a Sherlock Holmes story, there would be mystery or suspense. Even at times an amazing observation out of Holmes. But none of that occurred. The best they did was Holmes imagining a sequence of events before they occurred. And when it actually happened, he was usually wrong.Also, I would like it explained to me how a man subsisting on cocaine and formaldehyde can beat up four goons in an alley? Really, maybe he was doing meth and had some sort of crazy energy. Or perhaps the makers of the movie thought that they could infuse a bit of Iron Man here. No wait, even Iron Man needs some sort of mechanical help to achieve these results.The story line is non-existent and leaked in spurts to the audience through explanation rather than involving us in the discovery of twists and turns. We know in the first 15 minutes or so that Moriarty is behind everything. And what is he behind? Arms acquisition and making money off of it. Again the same theme of several modern day super hero movies and action films.The whole thing left me thinking, have these people ever actually picked up Arthur Conan Doyle's work. If you were involved in the production of this film, you may not know this, but he made Sherlock Holmes up. I am happy to say I have his entire collection unabridged of Sherlock mysteries upstairs. I checked it out of the library today because I feel so dirty after watching this horrible use of Sherlock that I need to be infused with the real Sherlock or life just won't be balanced correctly.By the way, I thought I'd let my kids watch it, because, after all it was, I thought, a lot of action. They turned it off after half an hour with these comments: 'It was boring', 'I didn't understand what it was about', and 'Could Sherlock Holmes see the future?' LOL.Rent it if you are a die hard fan and just have to see it for yourself, but don't expect much and get ready to dust off your library card.",1,6,11,30 July 2012
Cloverfield," Wild ride, anticlimactic end
","This movie had great suspense, I liked the characters, was a lot of fun and really had you wanting to see how it would end. Apparently the writers weren't sure either. I left feeling they forgot to add on the last five minutes of the movie. I would recommend waiting for the DVD. Of course, the filming was in the documentary, Blair Witch style and a little shaky at times. At first I was worried about this because of other comments, but I got used to it. It was a really great way to treat a monster movie, letting you get little glimpses but not a real great look for a long time. Totally fresh for the presentation of the story, but like I said, it didn't give a resolution in the end. A real disappointment, because I was rooting for it with the great story.",4,2,4,26 January 2008
