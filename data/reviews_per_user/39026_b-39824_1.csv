The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," My experience
","Hello everyone, I'm reviewing this movie as an assignment.So first of all I don't like the Hunger Games series as a movie because it's a bit too much talking. Just like this movie. The first hour and 20 minutes it's just talking and lore but no action and then when the hunger games finally start it's only 20 minutes of action.The thing I also don't like about this movie is just the weirdness to it like the fashion and the 'overexaggeration'.So did I like the movie? Not really but it also isn't a bad movie... It's just not my type of movie but I understand people who read the book and found it amusing to watch.",5,3,8,15 June 2015
