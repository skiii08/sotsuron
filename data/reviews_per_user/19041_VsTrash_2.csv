The Blair Witch Project," What exactly did i SEE ?
","NOTHING.this is the type of movie i would describe as : LEFT IN THE DARK. if you don't like movies with open endings, ure gonna hate it. if you like an original movie go see it, it will grip you. i tried imagining it was real and found it a lot more scarier that way.okay, i didn't really like it ! u see nothing :(",6,1,3,17 August 1999
Driven," Not even close to a real racing movie.
","Okay, this is coming from a true fan of racing.We all saw sly doing research on his new flick. Crawling around in the F1 & CART paddocks.  I was expecting a racing movie.  Okay it needs story, they try to add it ... but what a weak try.Back to the racing action ... the crashes are like the most utterly terrifying ones I've seen. We all like a good shunt but damn .... as a true fan to see that happen would turn my stumach all over.  Luckily these are more then dramatic ... very unrealistic ... over the topWhen was the last time you saw guys driving on a lake ? The handling of the cars doesn't seem real either ....The racing action is not very well put into picture as is the race for the championship etc..So in general .. buy Days of Thunder .. leave this flick alone.",5,0,1,11 May 2001
