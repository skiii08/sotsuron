The Avengers," Umm...people, movies are not rated solely on action, CGI and funny dialogue.
","If movies were given great ratings based only on action packed sequences, state of the art CGI and humoristic lines, then The Avengers would surely be one of the best movies ever made. However, a great movie is instead judged by it's coherent story, character development, good acting and the parallel between the movie and our real world situation. These are just to name a few and The Avengers clearly lacks all of these.Even though the opening sequence was well done and was promising for the rest of the movie, I found myself anxiously sitting in my chair waiting for the end of the film. The repetitive action sequences and the predictable turn of events really made this movie a 2 ½ hour snooze-fest.Why this movie has a 8.8 rating as of May 7th is really beyond me. This movie deserves at most a 7/10 but only if you feel generous. Without getting into to much details, The Avengers' structure, plot and setting is very similar to Transformers: the Dark of the Moon but instead of having the Autobots you have Marvel superheroes and instead of having Megatron and company you have Loki and his crew. Everyone hated that movie, it currently has a 6.3 rating, so why the heck is The Avengers so well rated?! It's sad to see that such brainless movies are making a ton of cash and are in the interest of nowaday moviegoers and big movie companies. Hopefully come end of July, Christopher Nolan will enlighten moviegoers with his soon to be epic/legendary masterpiece The Dark Knight Rises.Avengers disassemble, and let the Fire Rise!",5,5,20,7 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The overdose of comic relief ruins the entire movie
","I did not have high hopes for this movie. Knowing that the previous film was an average B movie, no more is expected from this flick.This whole movie is packed with idiotic comic relief and totally improbable action sequences. And this Sherlock character, my God is he ever annoying! He cannot open his garbage mouth without saying a stupid joke or mock his partner, even in a totally inappropriate situation where their life is hanging in the balance.This movie is full of clichés and cheese that I found myself at many times looking at my watch and wondering when this movie would end, and I also took a brief 2 minutes nap! Yup.Anyways, I won't elaborate more on this film. All you need to know is that it's a ridiculous and exaggerated action-comedy. But if you are the kind to enjoy an action packed film with every line coming out of the actors' mouth is a joke, then this movie is for you! If you however enjoy a smart and coherent movie, this film will bore you. Quite honestly, the only reason I went to see this film was to see The Dark Knight Rises' trailer in theatre, well at least that was worth my while.Anyhow, this film is not total crap, though. I give it a 6/10. A 7,7/10 rating as of today is really beyond me. At most this movie should have a 7/10 at best....if only it wasn't plagued with comic relief.",6,0,1,13 February 2012
Man of Steel," Zack Snyder? Felt more like a Michael Bay Film.
","Man of Steel, a movie geared to be successful. Director of the project is Zack Snyder (300 & Watchmen), excellent. Executive producer and co-story writer Chris Nolan (one of Hollywood's greatest) is also on board, perfect. The end result....a movie that gets lost in all its overblown action and CGI, which makes me wonder if this isn't a Michael Bay film (sure looked like one).This movie is a mess. The editing is poor. The pacing feels awkward. Heck, almost everything in this film doesn't seem right.I cannot believe how Snyder opted for 2 hours of action and only about 30 mins of serious dialogue.The only decent aspects about this film is Russell Crowe's bit and Henry Cavill's handsome looks.Overall this movie is quite disappointing for the non-action film crowd like myself who expect more in a movie.6/10",9,1,2,15 June 2013
2012," Is this movie a comedy, a family flick, an animated feature or a serious film depicting the end of the world???
","I finally got the chance to see this film on TV a few weeks ago, and I'm glad that I got to see this one for free because I wouldn't pay a single penny to watch this in theatres or in home media.This is your typical B movie: an average Joe starts out small and ends up becoming the hero saving the day, all the secondary and useless characters that the audience has no attachment to die, all the important characters survive, more action and CG than story and one of the protagonists scores with the hot girl. Oh, and of course the film is full of additional cheese and typical clichés.2012 is a movie that cannot decide what kind of genre it is. Is it an animated feature? Because 90% of the movie seems to have been done by a computer software. Or is it a family comedy? Because most of the time the characters popped out stupid jokes in critical life threatening situations and the main family seemed to survive by a hair the most extreme and catastrophic situations...and joke casually about it afterwards...ugh...Or is it a serious film depicting the end of the world, which is quite a big deal if all this doomsday BS actually occurs, as 90% of the time you see cities being destroyed and people being crushed by the force of nature.So there is serious drama and destruction going on and on top of that the characters with screen time pop the most useless and inappropriate jokes, avoid sure death and on top of that there is an overdose of unrealistic and exaggerated CG...yuck! This movie deserves no more than the minimum (1 star). However, this movie does somehow address the issue of social inequality, which is a theme I think deserves attention.So 2/10.",2,1,4,14 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Ignore all the hate, this movie is great!
","My goodness. What's up with everyone dissecting every single detail of this movie? Yes this movie has flaws, yes it's not perfect, yes it does have minor issues, but put all that aside and enjoy the picture. Once you sit back and enjoy, you can truly see what an achievement this movie is! It's definitely not better than the Dark Knight (the gold standard for comic book movies) but sure better than Batman Begins. This movie is an outstanding production and Nolan & his team definitely deserve massive praise for delivering one of the best conclusions to a movie trilogy.A solid 9/10.",9,5,9,11 December 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Very disappointing; did not live up to the hype
","I was amazed after viewing 'Part 1' and was very optimistic that 'Part 2' would be just as good as the first. However, this was not the case. It seemed to me that the whole movie was a quick wrap-up of the series as all it consisted of fight scenes in which the good wizards get rid the bad wizards in a battle lasting for about 2 hours on the big screen, literally. 'Part 1', on the other hand, did have it's fair share of fight scenes but also had a more diverse plot, a diversified setting, and more focus on the characters. Of course, I know that 'Part 2' was technically supposed to be focused on battle scenes as the second half of the novel is also focused on, well, battle scenes, I still feel that the filmmaker could done more than just fill most of the movie with large scale CGI battles, magical projectiles and explosions. If you enjoy visual effects, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you are looking for something more than just CG battles and fantastic fight scenes, this movie will disappoint you.6/10",6,1,3,24 July 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Reviews are not enough to describe how horrible this film really is.
","Instead of writing a large review pointing out all the horrible aspects of this film...I will just say that I encourage people to go see this movie for themselves. Yes you read right, go see this horrible film for yourself so that you can witness CG and cheesy scenes blended at it's worst and to witness one of the worst movies of all times, as this film definitely made my top 10 list of worst films ever (Transformers 2 is also in that list and I have yet to see the first film, which may also be included in that list).This film is absolutely horrible and do what you can to see this film for free, because it's not even worth a buck.As horrible as this film is, these are the reasons I gave this flick 2 stars: -By default, all movies on this site receive a minimum of 1 star.-The visual effects were good, even though at some point (especially in the last hour of the movie) the visual effects are all over the place giving you an unnecessary overdose of CG (thank goodness I did not watch this film in 3D, my eyes would have hurt a lot!). At that point in the film, you just can't wait for the credits to roll and leave the cinema. Kinda think of it, since the film is full of CG, they should have just made it into a computer animated movie, like that it wouldn't have needed all those horrible actors. Hmm, now that I think about it again, even the visual effects don't deserve to give this film an additional star.-I will give it another star for somehow being able to generate millions in revenue and being able to please a certain audience.Total: 2/10. I would have given it a 1/10 but I'm in a pretty good mood as I write this review, so I want to be a bit generous.As a final note, I just want to point out that I am very worried about nowadays' film audience which enjoy this type of film. Then again, I am more worried about large movie company executives and producers who allow for horrible movies such as Transformers 3 of even being filmed.So go see this film for yourself and be ready to worry about the mental health of individuals who thought that this film was even somewhat good.",2,7,15,24 July 2011
