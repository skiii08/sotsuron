Casablanca," Sheer entertainment, and also finely crafted
","Is this really a love story? The leading man spends virtually all the film being really nasty to the leading lady, and the only decent thing he does is to give her away at the end to another man! I'd have thought that the real theme of this film is not really 'love' - the private lives of a few people really don't amount to 'a hill of beans' - it's heroism. In this respect, Paul Heinreid's part is superbly underplayed: the film would become unbalanced if he outplayed Bogie - he couldn't anyway - but, at the same time, we must think it right that Else ends up with him rather than with Rick. And Henreid is very convincing in projecting this heroism.The whole thing is so irresistibly entertaining, that we often forget how finely crafted it is. The plot is complex, but we always know what's happening - there's even a little sub-plot included (about a young couple desperate to escape) that reflects the central plot. And, although Rick behaves badly through most of the film, director Michael Curtiz is careful to ensure that he never forfeits the audience's sympathy.As for the rest, it's all been said before. The most entertaining film ever made? I wouldn't argue with that. On a par, in my book, with 'The Maltese Falcon', 'The Third Man' and 'Singin in the Rain'.",10,1,1,21 July 1999
North by Northwest," Fine set pieces, but little sense of pacing or structure
","The opening sequences are superb, but, for me, it all goes wrong after the scene in the UN lobby. Just when Hitch should have been tightening the screw, he inserts a scene where a committee of FBI agents reveal to us that they know our hero (Cary Grant) to be innocent. This robs much of what follows of any real tension. Just when the pace should be hotting up, Hitchcock slows things down with that long sequence on the train, which, surprisingly, lacks any sense of danger. As so often with Hitchcock in the 50s, he seemed more interested in glamour than with anything else. And glamour doesn't mix very easily with menace.The famous scene where Cary Grant is attacked by a plane is fine, but it isn't integrated with the rest of the plot. (If someone wanted to kill Cary Grant, why didn't they just hire a gunman instead of a plane?) The plotline is perfunctory: Cary Grant makes his way into the villain's house, and instantly discovers what one of the best FBI agents has failed to uncover in years. The scene at the auction and the final chase on Mount Rushmore are, once again, memorable. But overall, this film appears to confirm my view that while Hitchcock was superb with individual set pieces, he never gave much thought to the overall structure or pacing. Even at his best (e.g. 'The 39 Steps' or 'Rear Window') Hitchcock doesn't give an impression of having an artistic vision to impart, which makes his reputation as a great director rather puzzling. No doubt his admirers see more than I do.",5,30,52,9 June 1999
