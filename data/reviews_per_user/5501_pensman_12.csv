The Equalizer," Bravo Denzel
","Of course we have seen 'this film' before. Except for a few unique film dramas, most of us like the familiar of new wine in old bottles. Recently Liam Neeson has turned the revenge flic into a minor cottage industry. And Charles Bronson did fine with Death Wish. Denzel Washington now gets a turn updating the old Edward Woodward TV series and he does a nice job. The bad guys are bad and unless you are a bad guy, you're going to cheer as this Robert McCall evens the score(s). No doubt we might like some additional back story, but I'm in no rush. I'm willing to wait for a second film for additional info. For this one, just sit back and watch this new Don Quixote tilt at Russian windmills. There are some nice performances here by Bill Pullman, Melissa Leo, and for me newcomer Johnny Skourtis. And Marton Csokas plays the villain we use to hiss at during the Saturday Matinees. Let's hope we get at least a trilogy out of this run.",8,2,5,26 July 2015
The Hunger Games," The Running Man for a new generation
",We tend to live in an era of special effects and CGI thanks to Industrial Light and Magic and few people will recall the original Logan's Run and The Running Man so this will seem novel when it isn't. The film is filled with great sets and attractive actors and will probably be a hit because of the books and a built in fan base. And there will be rave reviews but thankfully there can only be two sequels. I'm not suggesting this is a bad movie; it just doesn't offer anything really new. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was at least a clever manipulation of a story most in the audience knew well; this is a mid concept twist on The Most Dangerous Game.,5,31,116,9 March 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Strange Accent
","I was somewhat surprised that Jake Gyllenhaal made a good action here. At least for this film but he had a odd off-putting accent. I have no idea who he thought he was channeling. Gemma Arteton was adequate but just. There really wasn't much of a plot to this film and it basically drifted back and forth between blood and guts and humor. At least what I assume was to pass for humor. Maybe it is just better to stick with some of the old films like The Golden Voyage of Sinbad or The Thief of Bagdad or even The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. For 200,000,000 they don't make them like they used to and for a lot cheaper. But if you are really bored you might find yourself watching this. But why?",5,0,1,14 February 2011
The Hateful Eight," Watch Maverick 'Stage West'
","I suspect that Tarantino had of course a big budget and access to some A and B+ actors and a script but honestly if you want a more entertaining 50 minutes then try to watch an old episode of Maverick titled 'Stage West.' There isn't as much blood nor is there a who did it but more of a what might Bret be planning; regardless, I believe you will find the older story more entertaining. You still get killings and a psychotic killer played by none other the Edd 'Kookie' Byrnes before his fame on 77 Sunset Strip; but you don't get Kurt Russel and that fabulous mustache. But then the entire Maverick series didn't cost anywhere near 66 million dollars either.",2,1,13,8 January 2016
Little Miss Sunshine," Grapes of Sunshine
","All right, this is probably a lame comparison between Little Miss Sunshine and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath but I see it. Both films are about family and what pulls them apart and what holds them together. Greg Kinnear is in his own way Pa Joad trying to provide for his family dealing with economic forces he doesn't understand. Toni Collette is Ma Joad: keeping the family together is everything. Alan Arkin is Grandpa Joad, too old to kid himself and too old to be taken away from his home. Paul Dano is Winfield and a redemptive Connie Rivers. Steve Carell is Casy, a lost tag-a-long who finds his soul. And Abigal Breslin is Rose-of-Sharon who certainly is able to bring life and hope to a family in need of both. And that 'beauty pageant,' well if not the dust bowl is as devastating of youth and hope as the real thing. What a great film that can take you apart and bring make you better and so much more appreciative of being a member of a 'real' family.",10,1,4,14 October 2007
Bad Teacher," What might have been
",There is nothing really redeeming about this film. One has a hint it might have developed into something if it had decent writers. Justin Timberlake must have taken this role either to goof on himself or he just lost a bet. Cameron Diaz might have been hoping for a career reviving There's Something About Mary but there's no magic here. Her character vacillates between caricature and honesty. I know that sounds paradoxical but watch the scene between Garrett Tiara (Matthew Evans) and Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) while they are on the school trip. The only thing that makes you root for her is the ongoing battle between her (Diaz) and Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).,4,2,6,6 January 2012
Bridesmaids," Really? This film made how much money?
",I certainly waited for this film to come out on DVD and that was the right decision. This film seems split between wanting to be a comedy (the only scene that actually made my wife laugh out loud was the bit where the bridesmaids were trying on gowns and got an attack of food poisoning) and a coming of age drama as we wait to see how long it will take Annie Walker (Kristin Wiig) to become an adult. It was OK as a DVD flic but who would pay eight bucks for a ticket? And the cast listing on the IMDb seems odd. Chris O'Dowd who has a pretty pivotal role gets short shrift in billing while Terry Crews whose 60 seconds gets top billing. Explain that one to me. I have to infer women made this a hit as it was pretty much an ensemble female cast but so was The Help which actually had real actors actually acting. I believe the four rating is generous.,4,7,11,2 January 2012
La La Land," Bleech bleech Land
","There was a time that to be in a musical you had to have talent. You might be able to dance like Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly. Or at least if your dancing were suspect you might be able to sing like Sinatra or Streisand or at least like Meryl Streep. But La La Land is a perfect Millennial movie where everyone who shows up gets a trophy for trying. Today we tend to confuse talent with fame. As long as you have the right 'Q Score' and can pull in the right demographic then that's all you need. Even in the day of the dinosaur when they made West Side Story they at least made sure the featured players were made to look good by surrounding them with professionals Gosling has the requisite bona fides as heart throb, especially when paired with Emma Stone, and has some musical skill but he is dancing on his fame here, which is probably enough for today's audiences. The movie looks good and if you like splashy over saturated color then there are some visuals for you to enjoy if you were a fan of the TV show Pushing Daisies. No doubt this film will be a fav wth would be auteurs and wanna be Broadway dancers; However, I found it a romantic yawn but the 'chic flic' crowd will drag their dates to see it. Be sure you bring a phone and ear buds.",5,30,62,12 December 2016
American Made," Cruise and planes and guns and drug running
","When people see the 'come on' based on a true story, most know that alert has lost some cachet over the years. We have seen films like Hidden Figures and The Imitation Game and know the protagonists never quite come close to the real people, so we tend to approach these films with a level of detachment. At best, we hope the actors picked do the real people some justice. I don't know enough about the character Tom Cruise plays in American Made to know how far off the mark the film is; but let's be honest: I would be a fool if I though Hollywood 'Blockbusters' were trying to teach me authentic history. Regardless of authenticity, Cruise gives us a Barry Seal who is a highly watchable adventurer who somehow decides he can flip for the DEA and avoid the Medellin Cartel and Pablo Escobar. We end with an adventure movies just a bit short of being a modern Indiana Jones who has a larcenous heart. For pure entertainment and an increased adrenalin rush brought on by chomping down on popcorn, I would say American Made delivers. I don't know why some people dismiss Tom Cruise movies because he always delivers except for Eyes Wide Shut; but I figure Cruise saw the chance to work in a Stanley Kubrick production and missed all the cues that this was a bad project. Cruise does it all here and is just short of giving us a real Mission Impossible trip. Forget your Cruise animosity, see this is a movie theater with speakers rolling you around in your seat and chomp that popcorn.",8,1,3,2 October 2017
Inception," Well done
","The film is both unique and not. There is a soupcon of Rashomon, a dash of 'The Lady or the Tiger,' and a hint of Memento. Regardless, this is an arresting film with great performances and one that demands you pay more attention to what is happening on screen then stuffing your face with popcorn: a good thing. While this was shot also for IMax, the effects are not really the star of the show. They add to the story with some great visuals but do not overwhelm the film. This works well on a hone TV and you don't need a 65 inch screen to enjoy it. What mesmerizes is trying to figure out if what you are seeing is taking place as you see it or has it taken place prior; is Dicaprio a young father trying to get back to his young children or is he an old man who has spent a lifetime with the wife he loved? If you want a film with clear answers then stay away; but if you want a challenge, then catch Inception.",10,1,8,18 January 2011
Centurion," Deserves an Audience
","This is a film you stumble upon. I did. I saw it was about the ninth legion and knew a new release was coming out, The Eagle, based on the YA novel The Eagle of the Ninth. I figured why not give this film a chance. Glad I did. It is a nice tight little movie. It is well acted and well photographed. Michael Fassbender is excellent as Quintas Dias, a loyal soldier of Rome. And Olga Kurylenko does a great job. In fact she reminds of Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. If you need an entertaining flic for a stay at home Friday night then put the popcorn in the microwave, get a cold soda, and sit down for a fast paced 90 minutes.",8,2,5,10 February 2011
Easy A," More of a lazy A but still fun
","An obvious riff on The Scarlet Letter but watchable and fun. There are the obvious stereotype liberal California parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson with great style. They're not completely clueless but trust their daughter's common sense. There is an adopted younger black little brother whose presence is meant to reaffirm the parents liberal bent but nothing is done with his character. It's as if the writers figured they would get some ideas but never did. Emma Stone is fine as Olive the modern day Hester Prynne but unlike Hester Olive wears her A, literally, as a virginal do-gooder throughout the film. She assists teenage boys in establishing a reputation as a stud while she trashes hers. There is the friend her turns on her (Alyson Michalka), the well meaning popular teacher (Thomas Haden Church) , the clueless principal (Malcolm McDowell) , and a traitorous guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow). A large number of allusions to contemporary culture are scattered throughout the film which add to the humor but in ten years few will recall the references. I enjoyed the references to the Demi Moore film The Scarlet Letter which only shared the title with Hawthorne's novel as everything else in the film sprang from the mind of some incompetent screenwriter. I got some good laughs out of this film but was never sure who the intended audience was. It is certainly a typical teen film but also a bit more. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this film but its quite watchable and you won't feel you wasted and hour and a half by watching it.",8,0,0,28 March 2011
