The Incredible Hulk," Fresh, quite fresh picture
",I don't have too much to say but this particular movie does make it's effect. Everything is dosed right. A bit of psychology is followed by a bit of action. Sounds and clips fill you with an incredible (right as Hulk is) freshness. I was swallowing every inch of it. Remember the scene where Bruce hides from Beth. It's a shot from real comics. And the first appearance of that second monster Blonsky is done like Cloverfield - makes you participate in this chaos. 10 out of ten for comics done right. Mr. Norton doesn't know how to play fake does he? He fixes even cartoon characters easily. And Mrs Tyler is all way long gentle natural and simply beautiful. I hope we'll see some more adventures of this unlikely likable hero. P.S. Why do they choose such unnatural surnames for the Russians. We don't have no Blonskies here. We're not pollacks )),8,4,7,25 June 2008
Inglourious Basterds," The Russian review
","Yesterday, right before I went to see this movie, I've read about the 'first 100% failure by Tarantino'... Now when it's over, I totally agree.There's my few notes: Pitt plays middle-American cowboy and does it in exceeding stupidity. He doesn't fit there anyhow.Tarantino knows nothing about the Jew hatred to the Nazis. It looks absolutely artificial and in the same time exaggerated. I'm sure that Jews themselves are ashamed of the way they were shown in there.Two gags isn't enough for such a movie.Those on screen signs and fonts used were good for Bill and for Bill only.This movie isn't about anything: not war nor Nazi, not death nor beauty...I'm sure Tarantino himself knows it better than we do... Things I liked: First scene is almost good. Christoff Walz plays very well. Soundtrack is always good.",6,2,11,27 August 2009
The Ugly Truth," Fun, Love and Happiness!
","This movie delivers everything you expect from a romantic comedy! Dozens of fun scenes and a good chemistry between Buttler and Heigel. Lots of jokes: adult and universal. The Buttler's character is absolutely positive and charming. I guess we all want to be that kind of a man: straight, confident, sincere. And Heigel's character is so real with all those issues about the relationships and frankly vulnerability. Of course, life is much more complicated but leaving the theater you feel yourself happy and mighty in the questions of fascination. Thanks to the writers, the story doesn't fall in dynamics and doesn't bore you until the credits.",9,13,26,13 September 2009
