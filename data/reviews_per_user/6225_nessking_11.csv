Catch Me If You Can," watch me if you can
","I went to see this film expecting alot of delicate, well done, directing. I would have to say that i got just what I wanted. If you take fine actors and put them into one film and have a genius direct it what do you get?  An Oscar. This film by far is a great achievement on Mr. Speilberg's part. Mr. Di Caprio and Mr. Hanks as well as Mr. Walken all were incredible as they embodied these true life characters. I will aprecciate Mr. Speilbergs work and refer to this film whenever i talk about his films. Log this one away in your memory bank folks. But be careful, dont lose it!",Null,0,0,25 December 2002
Fargo," Coen Genius
",I love the works of the coen brothers (Excluding O brother where art thou?). Fargo was a delight to watch because it was so well put together. The aspects of the film were almost perfect. The acting is what i would call fabulous and outstanding! See the movie if you haven't already and you will be pleasantly surprised.,9,0,0,20 March 2002
American Psycho," wierd entertainment
","As dark as this movie was, it had me laughing at some parts despite the fact it was about a split personality psyco killer. The film showed the story of a sucessful buisness man who killed female prostitutes as a hobbie on the side. It was a subconcious addiction. Yet the killer gets away with everything. I especially like Christopher Walkens small role as an investigator. The movie was absolutley entertainingly weird.",Null,0,1,20 March 2002
American Beauty," American Booty
","American beauty is a feast of lust and hate, and marajauna. The story of a 42 year old man infatuated with a high school teen seems like a desperate attempt at making an original movie. And guess what...it worked! This movie pulls through with an original story and squeeses in a little dirty humor on the side. This enjoyable flick literally means what the tagline says: 'Look Closer'. Watch this movie and don't forget to look closer.",7,0,0,20 March 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A bumpy ride
","This is one great film. I went to see this movie expecting a little more of a conspiracy plotline. I am so glad to say that it is far from that.Michael Gondry will forever remain one of the most original filmakers in the history of motion pictures. His story's are like taking a hay ride through surrealism. One would be absolutely thrilled at the marvels he has  made for the screen. I myself enjoy Mr. Gondry's work on a regular basis.Okay. The movie itself is well put together. At first you may fell like 'Where the heck are we going with this?', but then two seconds later you'll find that what you have just seen makes perfect sense. The movie seems to take a u-turn at one point. This causes you to see the whole film in a different perspective. Wether or not Mr. Gondry does this on purpose could mean the difference between blind luck or pure genius.The acting. I have never seen a better performance by Mr. Jim Carrey. I say this with absolute sincerity. I am completely serious. I can honestly say that Mr. Carrey made an absolute believable character in this film. I have never seen him perform a character like this. Carrey can act. I mean he can act. The things his character does and says. The expressions on his face alone were so real that at one point during the movie I forgot I was watching Jim Carrey on the silver screen. All that I have just said applies to Kate Winslet. Her performace shook me up. She hasn't played a character like that and I personally think that this film will do wonders for her career. As for the rest of the cast...wonderful. Tom Wilkinson seems to deliver a great performance without lifting a finger. I have never seen Mark Ruffalo really. I don't know much about him, but from what I have seen he can act. Kirsten Dunst was absolutley phenomenal as a character. I think she is a better character actor than a lead actor. She has the ability to carry a story as a minor character in a film. Elijah Wood as always is fantastic. Mr. Wood has made quite a career for himself in hollywood. I expect great things to come of his success.To wrap up this rather thrown together review, I can only end it by saying: GREAT FILM, PHENOMENAL DIRECTOR, PLEASANTLY REAL ACTING, DELIGHTFUL STORY. See this movie now you euphoric hungry person you.",10,0,1,21 March 2004
Ice Age," This is one you don't want to miss!
","Ice age captures the emotions it is trying to trigger in you. And it does a good job of doing that. It very entertaining and fun to watch. That is what made it such a good movie. If you don't want to see it, then don't see it. But i would see it If i were you. Exellent performance by John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, and Ray Romano!",10,1,3,31 March 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," fantastic
","Like few movies do, the shawshank redemption capture that feel and atmosphere of a good movie. I find myself watching this movie over and over. It does a good job of wowing you whilst shocking you. Do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie!",10,0,0,20 March 2002
Shrek," I don't know what to say(really, really, really good)
","Are you depressed? This movie is the cure! Shrek was a much more deep film than most people realized. I don't care what anybody says about it. This movie really helped me. Just look at Shrek and donkey they both had their problems, especially Shrek who was emotionally damaged. This movie helped me to realize that i am who i am and that's the way it's going stay. And it made me feel good about that. It should do the same for you not to mention that it would make you laugh your larynx out. I'm not going say anymore because you need to find out for yourself. Sit down with your family, or by yourself and watch this movie.",9,0,0,12 November 2001
Signs," Great cast, great acting, great direction, great story, great movie
","If you have not seen Signs yet, you have probably guessed it is about extra-terrestrial life on earth. After you have seen the movie you may or may not think differently.  Signs goes into detail about the emotional well being of the main characters. I was surprised to see the movie achieved this in such a short time. Graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson) is a former reverend, and seems to be loosing faith throughout the movie. Gibson superbly acts out this emotional distress that Graham has. I can't tell you much about Grahams emotional role in the movie, seeing as it would give away too much about the film.  Merrill Hess (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is Graham's younger brother. Allot of the story is shared with Merrill. Merrill also has his mental weak points. Phoenix to has an excellent performance.  Morgan and Bo Hess are Graham's two children who play almost a bigger role than the adult performers. Rory Culkin delivers and makes the movie all the more entertaining as well as Abigail Breslin. Almost all of the things showed in the film build up to the ending. Though I have to say I didn't know how it was going to end. That is one of the things that make Signs and excellent movie. M. Night Shyamalan weaves a most original plot. He of course, plays a small, almost cameo role in the movie.  The movie will in a way scare you so that you don't even know how deep the story line is until later. This movie is one of the most original pieces of cinema I have ever seen. My opinion simply stated:' See the movie'.",Null,0,1,8 August 2002
Donnie Darko," Problems
","Donnie Darko is a film that you could see many times and not understand it. That is if you don't have problems. If you have seen this movie, but have never had emotional problems, then you will never really understand what the movie is actually about. Those of you that have emotional problems...you understand perfectly what I am saying. Donnie is a teen that is afraid of being alone.(I would be extremely surprised if you caught that the first time you saw the movie). Frank is another story. See the movie and maybe you'll figure it out.",10,0,0,20 March 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," What the...
","I am sorry i really am. I just can't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. Despite the great acting it displayed, it was a pretty unpredictable movie that left me angry. I will never look at John Goodman the same way ever again. Do yourself a favor and don't damage your intellect by seeing this movie.",3,1,2,12 November 2001
