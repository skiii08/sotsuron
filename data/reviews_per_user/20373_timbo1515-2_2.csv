Vertigo," The movie that keeps on giving
","-spoiler warning-There are many films that reward multiple viewings, but I've never seen one that rewards you as much as 'Vertigo' does.  I've seen this movie about ten times, and I just watched it again a few days ago, looking for details I might have missed.  At the beginning of the film I noticed that Midge was explaining to Scottie that he couldn't easily lose his acrophobia - that only another 'emotional shock' would do the trick.  And sure enough, that emotional shock would come when the real Judy falls off the belltower at the end of the movie, revealing a cured Scottie looking down in disbelief. There is so much substance in this film that I couldn't possibly go into any specific aspect in detail.  All I can say is that if you've only seen it once, do yourself a favor and watch it again - you'll be pleasantly surprised.",10,4,5,8 October 2001
The Usual Suspects," Overrated
","The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that this was one of the greatest films of all time.  Seriously, I don't mean to call this a bad movie by any means - it was brilliantly written, with solid directing and great performances from an ensemble cast.  But ranking this movie as the fifteenth greatest in cinematic history is simply outrageous. Personally, I don't like ranking films according to their greatness - unless you've seen every film ever created it's a little difficult to judge, and even then, what grounds do you base your judgement on?  My point here is that every 'top ten' list or 'greatest of all-time' list should be taken with a grain of salt, or in this case, maybe a whole tablespoon.",8,0,1,2 January 2002
