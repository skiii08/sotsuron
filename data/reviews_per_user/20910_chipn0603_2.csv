E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," famous movie
","The three kids live with their mother Mary, who dresses nicely and drives off to work every morning.One night Elliott encounters an extraterrestrial alien who was accidentally left behind when his spaceship had to leave Earth in a hurry. But the extraterrestrial turns out to be completely harmless, and the kids bond with him and start to refer to him as E.T.I love the last famous scene which he flies by bicycle with E.T. There is rainbow line after their truck.I thought that the strong performances by the young actors in 'E.T.' made their characters come alive. The story is ordinary,however, i didn't feel infantile in this film. Therefore this movie is a immortal masterpiece.",Null,0,1,9 October 2013
