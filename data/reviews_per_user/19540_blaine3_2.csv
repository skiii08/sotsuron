Spartacus," Caesar's name
","Larrysmile1 is wrong. Caesar his real name, name, it only later came to mean king or Emperour, the name evolved into Kaiser in Germany and Czar in Russia Most Roman Male Names had three basic parts:  the Praenomen,  the Nomen, and the   Cognomen. THE  PRAENOMEN  -  This form of  personal   'first'  name was relatively unimportant, and was rarely used on its own.  It was the first name element in the three part 'Tria Nomina' naming convention used by citizens of Rome.  The Praenomen was frequently the same as the father's. The nomen was termed as the 'Nomen-Gentilicum' and was the family name of the 'gens' or clan and almost always ended in '-ius'.   It was the second of the three names normally adopted by a Roman Citizen.THE  COGNOMEN  -  The cognomen was the third of the three names of a Roman Citizen.   It was a nickname or personal name.  Caesar was supposed to mean 'Hairy'The   PRAENOMEN was rarely used, Caesarwould have been referred to as 'Julius' or more formally as 'Julius Caesar'",Null,1,2,12 May 2002
Black Hawk Down," The brass could have consulted the Pakistanis in advance
","Synchonic 'The answer is that political considerations intruded on military necessity--one can only be outraged that the U.S. Army had to borrow armored vehicles from Pakistan to go in an get our men trapped by thousands of hostiles with guns. Typical Clinton Administration fecklessness--though there is a modicum of justice that the then Defense Secretary, Les Aspin, it is said, lost his job over this.'Or, since it was a multinational operation, the US could have requested armor support from the Pakistanis in advance. Seems it was poor planning by the brass. I don't know at what level the mission was proposed, planned and approved so I don't know how much blame to assign to Clinton.",Null,0,0,5 February 2002
