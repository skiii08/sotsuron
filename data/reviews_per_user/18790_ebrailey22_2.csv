Hereditary," Not what I thought it'd be
",I thought this was going to be a elongated version of the tape from the Ring. That's what I got from the trailer. Instead it's an extremely intense drama about death within the family and the mom losing her mind over everything that's happening. I found myself saying 'oh my god' out loud like 5 times. Watch it by yourself in the dark.,10,4,8,29 October 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Great so far
",I found this movie and literally knew nothing. What drew me was the bright red logo for it and I thought itd be cool to just watch it knowing nothing. Thought it was a horror movie cause of the way the title was drawn. Just said JOJO RABBIT. Anyways I really like it so far and I'm 20 min in and paused it to see the reviews and I had no clue his mom was hiding someone. Like I'm actually mad you guys let that in the premise on the main page. Comeon. That would have been such a cool wowwww scene but no. Come on,10,5,23,24 October 2019
