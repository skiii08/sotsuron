The Blair Witch Project," Best horror movie in years!!
","Less can be more, and for 'The Blair Witch Project' less means more realistic and more terrifying.  Despite (or because of) no gore or special effects, a better horror movie will not be released this year.  The mockumentary follows three young film students into the Maryland woods in search of the legend of the Blair Witch.   The movie itself offers little about the history of the legend.  Glints of information are presented as hearsay and gossip from the interviewed townsfolk and a turn of the century text on the little known legend.  It works to the picture's benefit, as does the grainy feel of the handheld footage comprising the entire picture.  The result is an  impossibly heavy tone of mystery, paranoia, and hysteria that builds layer upon nerve fraying layer.  The writers and directors understood what it takes to make an effective horror movie.  They constructed likeable and believable characters.  We're not watching a platnum bimbo and mindless frat boy being stalked by a faceless menace, we like and want the three young students to make it.  Secondly, they understood that what we can't see is always scariest.  The beast is never as frightening or as real on screen as it is in our craven minds.  'The Blair Witch Project' is the ultimate campfire story.",10,1,2,25 July 1999
Gremlins," Funny and delightfully twisted
","Despite the cute exterior and fuzzy main character (Gizmo), this film is surprisingly subversive given that it was advertised as family fare. Sadistic mayhem ensues on Christmas eve:  the little green monsters kill hapless denziens gleefully, the hero's mother splatters a few gremlins before being attacked brutally, the hero's girlfriend tells us how her father died-- falling down the chimney, breaking his neck while pretending to be santa (my god!)-- and finally a melting scene that would make any dracula envious.  This is not a kids movie.  There are corny moments but are instantly undercut by something sinister.  Dante does well in the execution of the kinetic action, treating it like a live cartoon.  Have fun with this nasty one!",8,0,1,10 August 1999
