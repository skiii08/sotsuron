Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Most Overtly Anti-American Non-Comedy Film Ever Conceived
","Borat has to be the single worst comedy film that I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Full of unfunny actors speaking unfunny lines written by unfunny comedy writers, and shot in a sloppy, documentary-esquire style that gives you a headache in the process. The problem is not that the jokes are racist, prejudice, or just down-right offensive to any person (although that doesn't make them any funnier): it's just a terrible movie.There are three things that make Borat the worst comedy of all time...1.) Sacha Baren Cohen overdoes the racist comedy to the point of me wanting to actually e-mail him a death threat. I am not Jewish, nor am I of any other ethnicity or creed that he offends in this film, and I still wished a horrible demise upon him. If a person is Jewish (like Cohen is), that does not grant that person automatic ability to attack the religion for the sake of comedy. If that person, however, does proceed to make a film about a character telling such jokes, at least make an honest attempt to do a few that don't suck. (The Jew-Egg scene comes to mind, and the scene where the elderly Jewish couple rent out their room to Borat, have to be the worst part of film, except for the golden egg that is reason #3.) 2.) Borat's accent was actually more painful to listen to (no, I'm not exaggerating), than running a cheese grating over my eyes. But, the most annoying part is that it became a fad, like 'lol,' and 'brb.' Part of the reason people think he's funny is because they know he sounds nothing like a real Kaszakh native, which is the ultimate oxymoron.3.) As I mentioned above, the film is not even an hour and twenty minutes long. For around seven of those minutes, Borat and his more-than-slightly obese Kazakh friend fight and chase themselves through a hotel... butt-naked. This unforgettable scene is complete with the aforementioned accent and a censor bar placed and sized to make Borat's business seem larger than that of a walrus. Hah-ha. Cough-cough.For any of those who read this that actually liked this film, I am not insulting you, though I will be more than happy to never meet you. If there were only a rating lower than zero. Perhaps a holy s**t would suffice. I'm not kidding. It's that bad.My rating: Holy S**t/10.0",1,1,3,1 July 2009
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A Great Story Crumbles
","I just want to start off saying that I thought the first Hellboy film was an amazing accomplishment, complete with a sturdy story, stunning visual effects and acting that didn't go overboard like most comic books films. Having said that, I thought that The Golden Army was a monumental disappointment.Selma Blair's character pulled a 180 in this film when compared to her performance in the first. From her unnecessarily ridiculous hair-cut to her less than satisfying acting, she completely downgraded everyone else around her. I haven't had the luxury of reading any of the Hellboy books yet, but if she had the same hair-do in the comics, please comment and tell me why.Once again, I'm not entirely sure if he was in the comics, but Johann Krauss ruined the entire film for me. He had no significance; contributing absolutely nothing to the story and having the hilarity level of about a made-for-TV Disney channel movie. Please, for the love of God and all that is holy, why was this unimportant, uninteresting and downright inexcusable character allowed any screen time? People who are used to watching new and experimental films during this modern era of cinema must learn to not be so black and white about what they see. A movie needs more than witty action banter and showy special effects to be worth a move ticket. And though I have seen much worse, don't get me wrong, The Golden Army just didn't measure up.",5,6,11,2 June 2009
Alien," The Beast Rises
","Alien is the best 'monster movie' of all time. It has all the best aspects of a science fiction movie, a horror movie, and an action movie, all wrapped up in one terrifying, heart-pounding slime-fest. All the infamous Godzilla movies were men in suits, and they looked fake as hell. A mere twenty years later, an up-and-coming American director does the same thing will uncomparable results. I am not bashing Japanese filmmakers in any way, but seriously, watch a Godzilla film and then watch Alien, and tell me you can't tell which is better.Sigourney Weaver is incredible in this movie. She is perfect as the bad-ass space heroin amongst a team of corrupt or otherwise incompetent crew-members. She got an Academy-Award nomination for the same role in the sequel, and even though I didn't notice any difference from the first movie, I still think she did a great job.Ridley Scott kept a perfect balance of suspense, action, and horror in this film. Each kill took place in a dark corner of the ship and showed just enough of beast to keep the audience scared. A flash of the head here, a glimpse of the tail here, and then the unsuspected victim is lifted off the floor and into the rafters where he is silently dismembered and devoured.The Alien itself, though you don't ever get a real good look at it until the end, was expertly designed by H. R. Giger. What's better than an acid-bleeding, two-mouthed humanoid lizard monster that can crawl through air ducts and across ceilings as quietly as a mouse. Nothing is the answer. The Alien was played by an African tribesman named Bolaji Bodejo, (those guys are deadly without alien makeup,) who was hired to display the creature's movements.Alien started the science fiction/horror genre and remains the best of that genre to this day. Its induces in people a nostalgia for the earlier great sci-fi movies like Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and for earlier horror films like The Exorcist and Night of the Living Dead. But Alien remains one of the most influential movies from the 70s and possible of all time.",10,1,3,3 June 2009
The Elephant Man," A Parable of the Human Soul
","The Elephant Man is the single most underrated film in the history of American cinema. The performances were nothing less than flawless, and the atmosphere of the story, brought to life by a combination of hauntingly beautiful music and being shot in black-and-white, is other-worldy. I will break down every aspect of The Elephant Man so that I can explain exactly how this movie made me feel.1.) Jon Hurt plays the eponymous lead, Joseph Merrick, a sufferer of Proteus Syndrome who is flaunted as a sideshow freak. Rescued by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins,) Merrick is shown humanity and that there are those in the world who will see him for his inner beauty, rather than his outer deformations. Hurt's performance in the film, which was nominated for an Oscar but did not win (unbelievable,) was moving on so many levels. The most prominent of course is his sheer inability to comprehend the cruelty he is faced with; this is expressed in the infamous line, 'I am not an animal! I am a human being!' I swear to God, I cried my eyes out.2.) Anthony Hopkins plays Frederick Treeves, an English doctor who treats and befriends Merrick after rescuing him from the circus. Treves is the symbol of the essential goodness in people. Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors of all time, partly because of this role and partly because of his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter (Yes, that's right, the infamous Hannibal the Cannibal.) Treves is one of the few, and possibly the only person to show genuine affection for Merrick in the film.3.)The opening theme of the film gave me an unusual feeling. I wasn't sure how i was going to feel about the rest of the movie; it gave me a sort of hollow, foreboding sense. The eerie circus music also sent an additional shiver up my spine.4.) The most emotional scenes in the film, all of which obviously center themselves around Merrick, are as follows: 1. The scene in Joseph's bedroom when a group of drunken criminals break in and assault him, throwing him around and lifting off the ground, all the while circus music plays in the background.2. The chase through the train station, when an exasperated Merrick is run down by a crowd of angry onlookers. He is backed into a corner with, his malformed face exposed, and exclaims: 'I am not an animal! I am a human being! I... am a... man!' 3. The final scene of the film when Merrick commits an act of self-euthanasia by lying on his back to sleep, which he is aware will kill him. After examining a painting of a small girl lying flat, he imitates her in a final attempt to be 'normal,' resulting in his implied death. He drifts off to sleep as the words of his deceased mother ring out in his head. 'Nothing will die.'I have heard some critics say that after seeing the film they did not know what is said about the human condition. This angered me. The message was clear and simple, and that is: 'No matter the condition of the soul, the is still human.' This theme is wrapped up so efficiently in the film's most iconic line. For anyone looking to watch a great drama film, I highly suggest The Elephant Man.",10,0,0,4 June 2009
The Dark Knight," So Much Potential...
","I will admit, when I first saw The Dark Knight, I was blown away. However, after repeated viewings at parties, I noticed things that were corny or unnecessary, and some things that didn't make sense at all. I will explain exactly why this film deserves almost none of the ridiculous amounts of acclaim it has received since it's release.I will start off by saying that Heath Ledger gave a career-making performance in The Dark Knight. Though he was an incredible actor, I sincerely think that he never would have been able to top the Joker. This role stands out to me along with my other personal favorites, such as Hannibal Lecter (The Silence of the Lambs), Andy Dufresne (The Shawshank Redemption), Annie Wilkes (Misery), etc.The opening bank heist scene was the last real interesting moment of The Dark Knight. Seeing goons with clown masks robbing a massive New York bank definitely grabbed my attention. When the Joker was revealed, with his face-paint and devious smile, I was drawn in. But, after that moment, the film mugged me and left me standing in the rain.The Dark Knight was an involving, but not an overtly moving film. The story was nothing more than an amalgam of action/superhero film clichés, bland supporting characters, and weird technology, snowballed into one, giant of a Hollywood blockbuster, fueled by one great performance and a few cool fight scenes.Harvey Dent has earned himself a full paragraph in this comment. I... Hate... Aaron Eckhart. This mediocre actor does not look like, sound like, or act like a person that could be associated with a film such as The Dark Knight. He simply lacked the morally twisted personality of the Harvey Dent that the film depicts. Also, what they did with 'Two-Face' as far as character origin really irked me. I realize that Chris Nolan wanted to stray from the original batman films, but leaving the scarred by acid concept untouched wouldn't have hurt the film any. Harvey's resulting injuries were unrealistic and ultimately unbelievable. (His eyes and teeth were not discolored or mutilated in any way, which is impossible for the amount of flesh missing from his face, and he would have succumbed to crippling infection within an hour of leaving the hospital.) The line at the end of the film, spoken by the Joker, really hit me on a physiological level. He said, 'This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object.' This is a reference to Gotham's blaming of Batman for murders and accusing him of being a menacing vigilante, and also their turning to him for help when the Joker overruns the film. This message is a deep one indeed, though I think that Mr. Nolan had wasted it, along with his superb directing talent, on an utterly stolid film.In summation, The Dark Knight was not a terrible film, it is just vastly over-hyped. In the technical aspects, such as cinematography and sound, it excels tremendously. However, to say that it is a masterpiece of American cinema is highly inaccurate, and to place at number SEVEN on the top 250 list is both ignorant and disrespectful to all of the great films that it outranked. I recommend you watch The Dark Knight, as you will probably like it much more than I did, but, if you are like me, you will walk away remembering nothing but the Joker's demented laugh and a plethora of explosions.",6,15,29,2 July 2009
Up," A Bone To Pick With Pixar
","I went to see Up last month on the weekend of it's release, and I must say, I was a bit disappointed. While the film did possess a group of quirky, lovable, and original characters, as is typical of Pixar, the film lacked in other areas. Seeing as how Pixar films are my favorite animated films, I cannot let this travesty go unnoticed.The film starts with a young boy watching a documentary in a movie theater about an explorer named Charles Muntz. The boy idealizes this man, but his methods are frowned upon by fellow explorers due to his lack of follow-through; he is never able to bring back specimens of rare creatures that he supposedly finds on his expeditions. Muntz vows to travel to South America and not return until he has captured a beast.The boy, named Carl, goes home and meets a girl named Ellie with wild red hair and an adventurous attitude. The two become close friends, grow up together, and get married. A montage reveals the long, fruitful life they shared, ending with Ellie's death. Carl, deeply crushed by this, swears to fulfill Ellie's dream of traveling to faraway lands. So, when a construction crew threatens to send the now-elderly Carl to an assisted living home, he ties hundreds of balloons to the roof of his house and succeeds in lifting off and sailing away to the clouds. Little does Carl know, a wilderness explorer named Russell has stowed away underneath the porch and hung on for the ride.People who are used to the happy Pixar films of the past will be a bit set off by Up. The first third of the film is more dark than anything else, but luckily it is followed up by a happy ending.The aspect of the film that ruined it for me was the talking dogs. Now, before anyone reading this automatically shuns it, please hear me out. While Doug was extremely funny and possibly the greatest part of the movie (aside from Kevin), the army of talking hounds came across as a bit corny, especially the incredibly annoying chipmunk voice.Another part of Up that bugged me was the agility of the old men. For Christ's sake, these eighty-some year old guys were climbing up the side of blimps and flying houses, running through jungles and on top of mountains, and SWORDFIGHTING! (That part really got me). For a Pixar film, Up was very lenient in terms of physical believability. And to people who will argue, 'It's a kid's movie, relax,' or, 'It's an animated movie, relax, you wouldn't ignore it if The Dark Knight, an eighty year-old man came and saved the day by coming in and smacking the Joker with a steel walker. Of course they wouldn't. All other Pixar films, even though almost every one has either fantasy of sci-fi elements, has kept in close respects to basic physics.I have taken the time to write everything that I didn't like about Up, but it was not a terrible movie. It still has very funny dialogue and an intriguing visual style that make the film an enjoyable one to experience. Although it is definitely not Pixar's bets, as some comments suggest, it is entertaining and fun. If you are a fan of Pixar films or animated films in general, I recommend Up. You will most likely enjoy it more than I did.My rating: 5.9/10.0",8,2,5,18 June 2009
WALL·E," Greatest Pixar Film Since Toy Story
","-*- Spoiler Warning -*- Being an avid sci-fi geek, I can't help but be truly moved by this amazing film. WALL-E dabbles in so many different genres, like adventure, romance, drama and action, its hard to confine it to any one title but incredible.On a lifeless Earth, some 700 years in the distant future, a small cleaning robot scours the barren, trash-strewn landscape. The robot, named WALL-E, spends his days compacting the garbage into space-efficient cubes. After a hard days work, WALL-E returns to his home inside an abandoned space freighter. One day, while out working, an enormous ship lands in an empty stretch of land and deposits a small, white robot probe on the ground before shooting back into space. The probes name is EVE. WALL-E befriends EVE, and the ensuing adventures they share alter both of their lives forever.WALL-E is a purely visual film. Dialogue takes a back seat to animation here, so if you're a person who likes a movie with a lot of chatting, WALL-E is not your film. The character designs, for both WALL-E and EVE, are amazingly detailed and give them very humanistic quality.The sound effects in this movie are unique and original to the point where I found myself smiling every time a character spoke. The beeps and buzzes of the work droids, the various alarms of the ship and rocket launch noises bring an uncanny realism to the movie.The main theme of WALL-E is ultimately the most powerful aspect of the entire film. The evolution of machines to the higher emotional level and mankind's overthrow by means of laziness and avarice gives the story a chance to tell itself by letting the characters develop, instead of the movie simply being a series of event after boring event to drive the plot forward.When I went to the theaters with my family, I had to choose between going with my father to see the Dark Knight, and my mother and sister to see WALL-E. Ultimately I saw The Dark Knight (which was very good), and since both my mother and my sister said WALL-E wasn't very good, I was relieved that I had missed it to see DK. When I finally rented WALL-E, I was blown away. Anyone who is a fan of animated movies, science fiction movies, or just plain good movies in general, I highly recommend you see this one. You'll never forget it.My rating: 10/10",10,1,2,17 June 2009
Raging Bull," Great Film, Just Not a Favorite
","When I went into watching Raging Bull, I think I set my expectations too high. After hearing all the hype that it made about it being the greatest sports film, I just had to see it. I was not disappointed in the least bit, but by the end, I found that it lacked the same level of emotional girth that other great sports films were so abundant in.First and foremost, the acting in Raging Bull was undoubtedly one of the best of any film. De Niro was brilliant as the boxing paragon Jake La Motta, both as a young, talented up-and-comer, and a washed-up, overweight drunk. This was definitely one of De Nior's finest performances. Moriarty, at the tender age of nineteen, was perfect opposite the seasoned De Niro, and Joe Pesci gives another in a string of great performances as La Motta's concerned brother/manager.The film was an homage to the boxing scene in the 40s and 50s. I believe Scorsese shot the film in black-and-white to accent the heavy use of blood in the ring and experimental fight scenes. At some points int the film, the punches looked very fake to me, like in the beginning when La Motta asks Joey to hit him. Even if the punch isn't altogether powerful, a person's head will still fly back a considerable amount.Raging Bull was an amazing achievement in all respects as I stated before, and I am not bashing it or anyone who enjoys it in any way, but I don't think it will be one of those films that sticks with me. I will hold Raging Bull in high regard as it is a cinematic marvel, but I feel that is a perfect example of an acquired taste.",8,2,2,15 June 2009
Goodfellas," Scorsese's Greatest Film
","I admit that I was a little disappointed with Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver was incredible, but Goodfellas is without a doubt Scorsese's greatest achievement. Every single, blood-soaked, foul-mouthed moment in this entire movie was made even better by DeNiro's and Pesci's performances and Scorsese's directing.After the opening scene when Tommy (Pesci) is stabbing Batts in the trunk, my eyes were glued to the screen; and for two and a half hours, I didn't even feel like I was watching a movie. The performances in this film by everyone are so thorough that it is impossible to tell they're acting. No other crime film has ever kept me entertained, interested and alert as long or as effectively as Goodfellas.After I saw the Godfather and didn't think it measured up to the hype at all,(it was still an amazing movie, don't get me wrong), I concluded that I was simply not a fan of gangster films. However, Goodfellas really changed my mind. Although it is not my favorite of all time, it has destroyed my indifference to this undoubtedly fantastic genre.",10,7,12,16 June 2009
