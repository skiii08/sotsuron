Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Masterpiece Moviemaking from 'The Man'...
","Watching both volumes of this wonderfully energetic epic, one is reminded how much Quentin Tarantino adores movies.  His enthusiasm in paying homage to the westerns, kung-fu flicks and gangster thrillers that have shaped his life is infectious and tremendously welcome considering the vast sea of banality churned out each year by studios who are more infatuated with the bottom line than with the artistic merit.'Kill Bill: Volume 2' is a more talkative conclusion than one would expect after having seen 'Volume 1'.  Oh sure, it has tons of action sequences and tension filled scenes, but there are signature Tarantino conversations littered throughout.  This film gives more weight to the first, explaining and giving dimension to the characters and their actions.The film picks up where the other left off, as The Bride (Thurman) is half way through her list of people to kill.  Budd (Madsen), Elle Driver (Hannah) and of course Bill (Carradine) are still to be found and disposed of in a gruesome manor.What makes Tarantino so wonderful is his layering of plot threads.  He is able to intersperse sequences so that we are given vital information which we are not immediately aware that we will need later in the storyline.  He has such complete control of his timing and rhythm as a filmmaker, and keeps us unaware of that directorial manipulation by using humor and wit and intelligence amidst a blur of action and violence.  This talent makes watching a Tarantino film an event.  I am already looking forward to his next film.The drudgery of having to slog through another special effects bonanza (yawn), or a teeny-bopper romance (puke), or an animated kiddie-flick (ugh), or a gross-out comedy (frown)... All of that nonsense is made tolerable by those dozen or so films each year that show some originality, flare, passion and brilliance.  It is almost guaranteed that a Tarantino film will possess those qualities and be one to remember.  That's why they already have courses at major universities devoted entirely to his small repertoire of films.I only have two quibbles with the entirety of 'Kill Bill'.   The film should have been released as one long movie.  I don't mind the splice too much, except for the fact that Miramax charged me twice when they said it was not a decision based on financial gain.  But I feel the film will be a delight to watch as a whole when it is released as a special edition DVD sometime this Christmas.I must also admit to being a tad underwhelmed by the final few minutes of the saga.  I like the fact that it ended in a manor that was completely unexpected... but... it almost ended with a whimper.  I am making a mountain out of a mole-hill here, but I think there is a better ending to be found deep the recesses of QT's mind.I also want to send out my mocking laughs to those who left the moment the credits started to roll.  True film lovers never leave a film that they like the moment the writing hits the screen... I only do that to films I hate. It is disrespectful to the filmmaker and to the other members of the audience who don't want to peer around you and your tub-o-popcorn to see what they paid for.  Anyway, those who left missed two more sequences of film.  And I hope Tarantino doesn't include them on the DVD so that you'll never get a chance to see them.As for the 'Kill Bill' legacy... I think it's a marvelous display of a genius filmmaker having delirious fun with all of his influences and showing off every ounce of talent that he can pour onto the screen.  Is it as earth-shattering as 'Pulp Fiction'?  No.  Is it as well written as 'Pulp' or 'Reservoir Dogs'?  No.  'Kill Bill' is not an example of masterpiece filmmaking.  It is too silly and over-the-top for that description.  But is an example of masterpiece moviemaking that very few people will ever be able to duplicate.  There is a big difference between filmmaking and moviemaking, and Tarantino is a master of both.  His gaggle of imitators should find their own paths otherwise they will languish in paled comparison to 'THE MAN'.The full feature will be a joy to watch over the years.  It will hold up very well over time.  The first volume made my Top Ten List for 2003 and I have very little doubt that the second will make my 2004 list.  I hope it isn't 2010 before Tarantino makes one of my lists again.",10,18,42,17 April 2004

Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Achieved
","Mission: Achieved There is a trend in recent movies to open with a scene that occurs later in the film. Alternatively, there may be a voice-over explaining something that occurs near the end of the story. Many films have opened with this device over the years, but it seems to be an epidemic lately. Only a handful of films have ever really used the open-book foreshadowing to maximum effect. Were it not for the example in Ethan Hunt's (Tom Cruise) latest impossible mission, I may have been tempted to give this film an even better grade.As it stands, 'Mission: Impossible III' is still a really top-notch action blockbuster that comes closer to the superb 1996 classic than it does to the woeful 2000 dud sequel, directed by the pitiful John Woo.I wish this film hadn't opened with Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) counting to ten in front of a bound and gagged Ethan Hunt, imploring him to divulge the whereabouts of the 'Rabbit's Foot' or else condemn his girlfriend to a bullet in the brain. I would have much preferred to have that scene take me by surprise later in the film. It would have had more impact.However, on to the good stuff...After settling down with a nice girl, Ethan Hunt has retired into training mode rather than being a field-operative. His girlfriend, his friends, her family... They all think Ethan is a nice young man working for the highway traffic research department.Of course, seeing as there wouldn't be a movie without it, there is a scene where he is talked into returning for one last crucial mission -- saving a captured operative that Ethan once trained, named Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell).In a spectacularly gritty action sequence, Ethan rescues Lindsey from a heavily guarded warehouse and then takes her on a helicopter ride from hell amidst a field full of gigantic energy windmills.There are about half-a-dozen insanely impossible missions scattered throughout the two-hour running length. One involves negotiating the catacombs of the Vatican. One involves an utterly decimated bridge. One has Ethan restrained like Hannibal Lecter. One has him swinging between skyscrapers in Shanghai. And one has him journey to the afterlife.J.J. Abrams, of TV's 'Lost' fame, directs this mega-flick with a modicum of coherence, something coincidentally 'lost' on most action directors these days. At no time during this film did I feel 'lost' during hectic sequences. He is sure-handed enough to tell this story without resorting to incomprehensible mess to cover up the parts that audiences wouldn't normally buy.Tom Cruise plays his signature role with the self-assurance of a seasoned pro. He is in desperate need of some good press... and I think he deserves some for this thankless film. It is not the type of film that critics like to applaud too loudly... after all, this is pure entertainment. But he is brilliant here as the American version of James Bond.Ving Rhames also returns as Luther, the suave and oh so confident techno-geek. Ethan's new team members include Zhen, played with elegance and sexy confidence by Maggie Q, and a rather subdued character named Declan played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers (recently seen in 'Match Point').Michelle Monaghan plays Julia, Ethan's main squeeze. She is that 'perfect girlfriend' type... A beautiful nurse who trusts Ethan and all his mysterious secrecy. She is assuredly a new movie star and will soon be offered dozens of 'girlfriendy' roles.One real surprise was a brief but quite astonishing performance from Keri Russell, who seemed to virtually disappear after ending her title role in the critically acclaimed TV drama 'Felicity'. She plays so much against her delicate image here that it blew my mind. Perhaps that is the reason she took the role.As for Oscar winning Philip Seymour Hoffman... I am not sure that he gets enough screen time as the villainous Owen Davian, but when he does, he is dastardly vicious and cold-hearted. He was an inspired choice for this role.Overall, the film delivers all that is promised. I wish they hadn't tried to get clever with that opening scene choice, but the rest of the film redeemed itself. The stunts were inventive and exciting. The characters were more human than they were in either of the two previous efforts. The story had more emotion than most entries in the genre. 'Mission: Impossible III', should you choose to accept it, is going to end up as one of the best action films of 2006. This review will self-destruct in 5-seconds... ... ... ... ... psssshhhht.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",8,3,6,4 May 2006
Marie Antoinette," Sofia Coppola gets the quiet moments right...
","This isn't your mother's period-piece...I fell head over heels for this playful film within the first fifteen minutes. 'Marie-Antoinette' follows in the tradition of Coppola's earlier efforts, delicately balancing femininity and loneliness in a world that feels awkward and shallow. If you adored the sensibilities of the 2003 masterpiece, 'Lost in Translation', this film will strike many familiar notes.There are certain scenes in certain films that make you aware you are in the presence of greatness. I had that feeling when 'Amelie' skipped stones on the canal. I had that feeling when Lucius and Ivy spoke quietly on the porch in 'The Village'. I had that feeling when Elizabeth Bennett spun on her swing in 'Pride & Prejudice'. I had that feeling when Bill Murray told us that, 'For relaxing times... Make it Suntory time!'In this film, I knew I was watching something special when Antoine is making her way from Austria to France to meet her fiancé, the Dauphin -- heir to the French throne. In any typical period piece, the journey would have been brief, showing us her departure, a scenic middle shot to pass the time, and her arrival. However, in 'Marie-Antoinette', we are transported into her world. We are invited to share her quiet times. This journey reveals her youth and the boredom, nervousness and excitement that comes along with it.She arrives at the border to complete the transfer, as if she were a legal document. She is asked to strip and to bid adieu to her family, friends and pets. She is inspected and remade into the Dauphine of France, wholly unprepared for what lays ahead.Director, Sofia Coppola, is so attune to the complexities of young womanhood. Every film she has done explores the subject with such depth and care. I am not sure there has ever been a director, an overwhelmingly male occupation over the years, who has been able to capture those feelings on film with such clarity and wistfulness.Kirsten Dunst has never been one of my favorites. I have found her to be a charming and capable actress up to this point, but she has never blown me away. That is no longer true. Her portrayal is simultaneously exuberant and restrained, spontaneous and thoughtful, grateful and disappointed, blissful and tinged with regret.She plays the role with the freedom of a child -- and let's face it, Marie-Antoinette is exactly that. That she partakes in extravagant parties, shopping sprees, gambling entertainment & decadent feasts is only to be expected. She is a teenager trying to have fun in a stuffy world of structure and tradition, which she clearly describes as 'ridiculous'. 'But that, my dear', replies one of her assistants, 'is Versailles.'She is also pressured with trying to provide France an heir to the throne -- a task she finds difficult with such an aloof Dauphin (Schwartzman), who is more interested in hunting and key-making than in her porcelain assets.Everything about this film focuses on her insulated world, which stifles her natural energy, and her attempts to make it bearable -- perhaps even, dare she say it, a little fun.What Coppola does so masterfully here is to style this story in such a way, with lavish visuals and a mélange of music, that it feels like a 'young' film. She blends music of the time with contemporary tunes. She is unencumbered by the formal nature usually assigned to period pieces, shifting from the formality of Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' to the patience of Terrence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' to the free-flowing movement of Robert Altman's and Paul Thomas Anderson's steadicam. She doesn't demand uniformity with dialogue or accents. She allows the film to take on a life of its own, making it one of the most original efforts in recent memory.Coppola uses melancholic bands like New Order, films as varied as 'Amadeus' and 'Badlands', and designers like Vivienne Westwood to influence every single frame of this movie. It truly is a unique vision. This extremely talented director has already established her own look and feel. I am sure I would recognize one of her movies without knowing in advance -- and there only a handful of directors who can evoke that compliment.Throughout this film, there is a haunting thread of inevitability. We all know Marie-Antoinette's fate and the film glides to a delicate final act which avoids the predictable and gratuitous ending that some other filmmakers would have provided. Instead, we solemnly watch the final few days, as the angry civilian mob descends upon Versailles to revolt against the monarchy. We observe the farewells to friends. We are handed one final elegant meal, with a sympathetic touch of the hand... and a sorrowful goodbye from a carriage heading to the gallows.I am so grateful to have found another film like this. I am equally grateful to have another director whose films I will eagerly anticipate above all others. 'Marie-Antoinette' is assured a place near the top of my 2006 list. It is another quiet masterpiece for those of us who don't need our 'cake' handed to us on a plate.© Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",10,8,15,20 October 2006
Black Book," Sometimes, You Have to Hide in Plain Sight...
","Who said that they don't make films like they used to? A couple of weeks ago, I declared that 'The Departed' was the best film of 2006. Last week, I replaced the Scorsese epic with Sofia Coppola's luscious biopic of 'Marie Antoinette'. I never would have guessed that Paul Verhoeven (Yes, the Paul Verhoeven who directed 'Total Recall', 'Basic Instinct' & 'Showgirls'!!!) would challenge them both with a gripping, edge-of-your-seat World War II yarn.I use the old-fashioned term, yarn, because 'Black Book' is very much a film that feels like it was made decades ago. The lush visuals, orchestral music, European styling, wartime romanticism and cliffhanging chapters all add a certain 1950's charm to the white-knuckle plot. One gets the feeling that the ghosts of Gregory Peck, Hedy Lamarr, Ava Gardner, Spencer Tracy & Jean Harlow are embodying the cast of this classic espionage drama.The film begins in 1956 with Rachel Steinn, a school teacher at an Israeli kibbutz, being accidentally found by an old acquaintance, who is on vacation with her husband. The meeting brings back painful wartime memories and Rachel heads to a quiet place by the river to recollect our central story.So back we travel, to occupied Holland, circa 1944, and we see a more youthful Rachel, diligently practicing a bible passage in order to earn a meal from the family who is hiding her from the Germans. She, like many Jews at that time, were surviving by any means necessary in order to outlast the Nazi tyranny. However, one day, while flirting with a young man sailing on the nearby lake, her safe zone is destroyed in one fell swoop by a low flying bomber. Rachel is immediately on the run, aided by her new sailor friend.So much of this film relies on surprises and shocking twists that it would be unfair of me to detail too many plot threads. And my goodness, there are a tons of them. This is truly a definitive epic, in every cinematic sense of the word. Rachel is crossed and doubled-crossed and triple-crossed, eventually winding up as a member of the famed Resistance. Via cunning and fortunate circumstance, she manages to transform herself into Ellis de Vries, a blond bombshell who infiltrates the German command in the area. She uses a quick wit, a gorgeous voice, some feminine charms and a collection of Queen Wilhelmina stamps to crawl her way into the arms of Herr Müntze (Sebastian Koch).From deep within the Nazi camp, she is able to strategically plant a microphone and to use tidbits of acquired knowledge in order to provide the Resistance with vital information and plans. While evolving into a brave spy, she must learn how to reconcile her own personal vendettas and her surprising romantic feelings for Müntze.There are no more exciting themes for me in movies than tragic romance, espionage and escape. I have loved them all with a passion ever since I was a small child. Throw in a magnificent screenplay, marvelous cinematography, a plot that churns along with the efficiency of a Swiss watch, and the added bonus of a gorgeous actress -- the result is sure to be a huge winner for me. 'Black Book' satisfies everything that I truly want from a film. It is the reason I go to the movies. I was utterly swept away by the intrigue, drama, romance and tragedy. This emotionally weighty film even manages to deliver a few wonderfully witty moments to break the supreme tension of it all.The cast is immense. Every one of them exudes authenticity. It is one of the best ensembles of the year. However, I struggle to call it an ensemble because it would be ignoring one of the singular performances in recent memory. Carice Van Houten is not a household name to most. She is a Dutch beauty who, if this role is anything to go by, is on the verge of a magnificent career. Her grasp on the emotional turmoil of Rachel/Ellis is of profound proportions. It is a stunning turn that flatly demands award consideration. The range on display in this movie is astonishing. Rarely have I ever been as moved by a character's heroism and charm and guile and wits. She is able to create a sympathetic creature... one that we will root for until the end... one that we trust and believe in.I cannot leave this review without admitting to my utter admiration for Paul Verhoeven, a director whose films I have often enjoyed and panned in equal measures. This is the work of his lifetime. It is the film he should list above all others on his résumé. This is a thoughtful, poignant and tremendously thrilling adventure. For attentive viewers, the final scenes of the film act as a provocative meditation on the relationships between war and justice, peace and insularity, the actions of the past and the promises of the future. 'Black Book (Zwartboek)' is not only a riveting WWII adventure, but a superb contrast of morality -vs- reality.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",10,361,404,26 October 2006
Troy," I am on the fence with this movie...
","'I've fought many wars in my time. Some I've fought for land, some for power, some for glory. I suppose fighting for love makes more sense than all the rest.'***Well, I'm on the fence with this one. Despite some egregious liberties taken with the classic poem, 'Troy' is still inspired by one of the greatest stories ever told. I suppose I can forgive the inconsistencies with Homer's 'The Illiad' and try my best to focus on the film version which comes with a production cost of $200 million. As with all of these obscenely priced blockbuster movies, one expects and demands lavish sets, seamless special effects and extraordinary action sequences. In addition, one hopes to have a quality cast delivering passable dialogue. In the case of Wolfgang Peterson's 'Troy', he succeeds in some regards and fails in others, leaving me torn between a mild recommendation and a marginal failing grade. I hope by the end of this review I will be able to make up my mind.Almost everyone is familiar with the story. Helen of Sparta (Diane Kruger) is stolen away from her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) by Paris of Troy.In an act of desperate revenge, Menelaus seeks the help of his brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who controls the armies of Greece. Together, they launch a thousand ships across the Aegean Sea to attack the impenetrable city of Troy in hopes of recapturing Helen and exacting revenge on those who betrayed them. Their chief warrior is Achilles (Brad Pitt), a god-like man who wins wars by himself if need be. In their final attempt at destroying Troy, they create a gift to the Gods in the form of a gigantic wooden horse.The Trojan people bring it inside the gates of Troy unaware of its deadly contents.There are some other twists, turns and plot threads along the way in this 165 minute epic. Hector (Eric Bana), brother to Paris, is the leader of the Trojan army and is the father of a newborn infant boy. Briseis (Rose Byrne) is cousin to the Trojan brothers and is captured by the Greeks. In this adaptation, she is protected from the soldiers by Achilles and they fall in love on the eve of war. Odysseus (Sean Bean) is the messenger between Achilles and Agamemnon, who do not get along at all. He is also the one who devises the Trojan horse plan.Where to start? The ancient story is beyond criticism. I love the idea that the greatest war ever fought was for the love of one woman... the most beautiful woman who ever lived. I have no complaints with the premise of the film.The fight sequences are also laudable. This is especially true of the one on one battles. I really liked the way the camera flowed around the fights, never confusing us with lightening quick edits and extreme close-ups. I really felt like I was fully aware of the action at all times. The full army sequences were typically grand to behold and quite spectacular, even though this CGI army routine is getting rather tired. Every film that comes out seems to want to top the previous one in terms of scale. The armies in this film even seem to dwarf those seen in the Lord of the Rings flicks.However, despite the great story and the incredible action, this film fails in far too many areas to be considered a triumphant success. Although I appreciated the efforts of Eric Bana, Rose Byrne, Sean Bean and Brendan Gleeson, there are a few actors in this film that are truly awful. Most notably among them is Orlando Bloom, who is shockingly embarrassing as Paris. Every belabored twitch that Bloom tries to pass off as acting is cringe inducing. He imbues his character with the depth of a wading pool. It is one of the worst performances in years. I was also thoroughly disappointed with Peter O'Toole, who does his best impression of a skeleton while overdoing virtually every facial expression. Brian Cox has been a tremendous character actor in recent years, but his portrayal of Agamemnon belongs in a Steven Seagal movie instead. Even Saffron Burrows, one of my favorite actresses, gives a weak effort as she chews the scenery with her minimal screen time as Hector's wife.Brad Pitt handles a difficult task with a fine effort... although it may be in a losing cause. Much like Tom Cruise in 2003's 'The Last Samurai', he constantly struggles to overcome a very modern Southern California look while portraying a legendary warrior. I don't think Pitt gives a bad performance, but he may be too much of a pretty boy to pull this role off. Any viewer will have a hard time forgetting that it's Brad Pitt.Another thankless task is bestowed upon Diane Kruger. Any time that any actress is called upon to play Helen of Troy, the primary requirement is to be stunningly beautiful. And while Kruger handles that with sublime ease, it is her dialogue that lets her down. Some of the lines that she has to utter are quite pathetic. In fact, most of the cast has to deal with unintentionally funny lines of dialogue. However, Diane Kruger is undoubtedly a move star. She has the perfect face and a flawless body to match. Add a little acting talent and a drive to make it in the business and she will be around for quite a while. Just ask Keira Knightley, who became the new Hollywood it girl with a similar resumé.The great acting in this film comes from a select few. Sean Bean and Brendan Gleeson have small but notable roles that are played with supreme confidence. However, the two stand-outs are Eric Bana and Rose Byrne. Bana is magnificent as Hector, leader of the Trojan army. He exudes a presence on screen that dwarfed Bloom's and outshone Pitt's significantly. At no point while watching him on screen did I feel like he was out of place... he belongs in a film like this. Rose Byrne is my pick as the best thing to come out of this film. This Australian beauty reminds me of Monica Bellucci. Her minor role as Briseis may have been the most intriguing of the entire film. Her burgeoning relationship with Achilles was the one aspect of the movie that had me really riveted. I wanted to see that plot thread expanded upon. But in her limited screen time, Byrne was able to create a truly sympathetic character who felt more three-dimensional than the rest of the cast put together. I predict and hope that Rose Byrne will be a rising star in Hollywood over the next few years.Two final little issues I must raise have to do with the set design and the score. I found the sets to be amazingly unrealistic given the budget of the film. Many of the buildings seemed obviously fake. I got the distinct impression that I was looking at painted styrofoam rather than actual rock and granite. There was no real weight or realism in the sets. And as for the score, which is the most under-appreciated aspect of film-making, well... it stunk. James Horner has orchestrated many movie masterpieces, but this was his most forgettable work ever. One expects chills to go down one's spine in a film like this. 'Troy' barely has a single memorable bar of music. I was very disappointed.So... Have I made up my mind whether or not to offer a mild recommendation or a marginal failing grade? I am afraid I have to turn my thumb down on this one. It just didn't do enough to merit the price of admission. I came in hoping that this was going to be the blockbuster event of the Summer movie season. Instead, I left feeling underwhelmed despite a massive spectacle and a handful of quality performances. I've teetered back and forth in the few hours since seeing the film, and I concede that I may sway the other way in subsequent viewings, but for now I have to advise against a trip to see this adaptation of the classic tale.***TC Candler - Critical Mass Movie Reviews",Null,4,13,17 May 2004
Match Point," The Bounce of a Ball...
","There comes a point in a tennis match where the ball hits the top of the net. It bounces straight up in the air and, with a bit of luck, it falls your way. Woody Allen's 'Match Point' explores that moment of luck and all the consequences of it. Is it all just a series of random events? Are some of us just luckier than others? Sometimes, the bounce we want is not the bounce we need.Woody Allen is an awkward barometer of taste. You either like his writing or you don't. But even his most loyal fans have been restless with his latest offerings, chomping at the bit for him to try something other than a Manhattan relationship comedy with a neurotic lead male and a fine young thing as his muse.'Match Point' is exactly what his fans wanted... A break from the routine as he delves into film-noir, class distinction and romantic thriller genres, all the while delivering the same brilliant, pitch-perfect dialog that has come to define his work over the past thirty years.This film evokes that nervous laughter you feel when the tension is almost unbearable. It is paced so relentlessly toward doom that you just want to scream something at the screen to help the characters avoid their inevitable fate. At one point, when the actions of the lead character are at a boiling point, I was practically begging that character to reconsider.The screenplay is essentially a six character play. Chris (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro who meets a wealthy family while teaching at an upper-crust London country club. He soon drifts into a pleasant relationship with the daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer). There is nothing tremendously passionate about the two of them... It all just seems to fit.Chloe's brother Tom (Matthew Goode) is engaged to Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a voluptuous and sexy American who is extremely aware of the effect she has on the men around her. Her impact is immediately felt by Chris, and the sparks fly as they secretly rendezvous behind their wealthy loved one's backs.The final two characters are the stinking rich parents (Brian Cox & Penelope Wilton) of Chloe and Tom, who are virtually trying to buy the future happiness of their children.I won't detail the ingenious plot in much detail, but needless to say, relationships boil and cool, people leave and come back, suspicions are ignited and extinguished. And we simply watch as Chris tries to juggle it all with the sole aim of landing on his feet safely.It is a clever little story that will have your jaw dropped and your head scratched on more than one occasion. And the film does not compromise. It leaves us in the way a French thriller would... With more questions than we started. It is definitely a film that you will have fun discussing.Woody delivers his best film in years. He does it in a genre you won't expect. And he does it with a cast that is so acutely precise with every word, every undertone of innuendo, every movement and glance. This is easily one of the best ensembles of the year.'Match Point' is not a film where you will find likable characters... Hardly anyone in the film comes out clean on the other side. More than anything, this film will have you questioning the bounce of a ball as the key to it all. Is life just a series of fortunate or unfortunate breaks? I suppose it depends on your point of view.",9,14,23,6 January 2006
Crash," The title may suggest an action movie, but it refers more to the lonely thud of hitting rock bottom in a city that doesn't care.
","It's a shame that people don't line up around the block for films like this... films with a talented ensemble cast that deal with real issues, real people and real conflict. There's nothing fake about films like these... nothing escapist... it is just a slice of life story that hits home in palpable ways.I suppose the easy way to classify 'Crash' is by calling it a more commercial version of 'Magnolia', 'Grand Canyon' or 'Short Cuts'.It is far shorter than any of those obvious comparisons and it is less 'artsy'. In other words, 'Crash' is less concerned with impressive film-making and more concerned with efficient storytelling.The downside to imitation is that the film feels slightly 'done already'... it needs an extra hook to keep us riveted. 'Crash' uses racial stereotyping and tension as a means to an emotional end.Like those other films, Los Angeles is the setting. I've lived in L.A. and can testify that it is the lonliest city in the world. You never really feel like you make any true connections with people in that city. All those that were born there have moved away, and all those who live there now are temporarily relocated from other cities. No one seems to call Los Angeles their real home.The opening lines of the film, muttered by the fabulous Don Cheadle, capture that essence entirely.I won't recount the many plot threads that this film traverses. But in true Altman / PT Anderson fashion, the stories are all interconnected via family or coincidence.There are some truly remarkable performances in 'Crash' despite the fact that no one really gets the bulk of the screen time.Cheadle stands out and is quickly becoming one of our finest American actors. Jennifer Esposito delivers a fiery and powerful turn here. Even small roles by Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillippe, Brendan Fraser & William Fichtner deserve merit. Matt Dillon, Ludicrous, the sublime Thandie Newton, Michael Pena and Terrence Dashon Howard all deliver brilliantly. It is a great ensemble performance that will be remembered at next year's SAG awards.The main issue I had with this film was its use of coincidence. It just seemed all too forced in this film that is otherwise based in very serious reality. I felt a little manipulated by some crafty screen writing. I didn't buy the plausibility of many of the situations.I still recommend the film to any and all art house fans... but even with its desire to be more commercial than its predecessors, I don't think too many Star Wars fanatics will be giving up their place in line to watch this one. Those of you with Vin Diesel posters in your bedroom should steer well clear of 'Crash'! The title may suggest an action movie, but it refers more to the lonely thud of hitting rock bottom in a city that doesn't care.",9,2,11,6 May 2005
Closer," 'Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off...
","'Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off...but it's more fun if you do.'About two months ago, I began a self-imposed hiatus on writing movie reviews. I was a little tired of seeing so much crap make its way into multiplexes and to the top of the box office charts. I suppose I was a tad disillusioned with the landscape of movies and I needed a superbly written script to jog me back in to the ranks of enthusiastic moviegoer. Well, that script lies at the heart of Mike Nichols' new film 'Closer'.Unlike many other critics, I am not typically pessimistic about the current state of modern film-making. I truly believe that more great films are being made each year than in previous decades. However, the unfortunate correlation is that more crap is also being made each year. And consumers and critics alike are forced to sift through the drek in order to find the hidden gems.Golfers say that a round can often be filled with bad shot after bad shot, but that when you finally hit that perfect drive, all the frustrations disappear. I suppose the same is true with movie-going. 'Closer' is a perfect drive for everyone involved - The stunning cast... The veteran director... And the tremendously fortunate members of the public that will seek this film out in art houses across the country in the coming weeks. It is the kind of film that could put an end to my temporary burn-out and have me once again excited about the possibilities that this magnificent art form has to offer.Alice (Portman) meets Dan (Law) and Anna (Roberts) meets Larry (Owen). The two British men and two American women are all living in London. All four are intelligent and literate, passionate but cynical. They are all able to articulate their emotions and thoughts in ways that seem foreign to most movie characters. Listening to them speak, one can't help but be impressed with their ability to communicate. The script in this film is absolutely fabulous, filled with innuendo and double-entendres, wit and intelligence.The couples, Alice and Dan, Anna and Larry, are linked by Anna's photography. She does portraiture and is preparing for an exhibition. She is hired by Dan to shoot a portrait that will hopefully find it's way to the inside cover of his soon-to-be published novel. He is currently an obituaries writer.Larry is a dermatologist who spends some of his spare time chatting to horny 'women' on the internet. He is a says-what-he-thinks smart-ass who somehow manages to overcome a tremendously awkward first meeting with Anna. They are soon married.Alice is the mystery guest in this equation. She used to be a stripper in New York, but escaped a bad relationship by fleeing to London. Her rough first meeting with Dan leads to a seemingly loving relationship despite a ten-year age difference.Soon, the couples discover that they are not as happy as they appear. Cracks emerge and the situation leads to a switch of sorts. Anna divorces Larry to be with Dan. Dan leaves Anna to fend for herself, and soon she finds herself stripping again, giving table dances to lonely men... like Larry.The screenplay is vicious. The couples switch and switch back again as they lacerate each other with dialogue meant to inflict heartfelt pain. Some might think these are four horrible people. Some might claim that these are good people driven to cruelty by circumstance and heartache. I think there may be a middle ground in there somewhere.The performances are all genuinely Oscar worthy. Although it is possible that none of them can be considered a legitimate lead character... and by that logic none are supporting characters either. The Academy will have a tough time choosing and it may split the vote. I am sure the cast will get mention for 'Best Ensemble' at award shows that feature that category.The two who stand out for me are Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. Both turn in spectacular roles filled with the gamut of emotions. Couple this outing with hers in 'Garden State' and Natalie Portman has appeared in the two best films I've seen all year. She will probably be my 'Entertainer of the Year'. 2004 has seen her develop into a superb young actress who has a legendary career ahead of her if she keeps picking roles like these.Clive Owen is a sleek and powerful actor who is able to deliver lines like they are being shot out of a cannon. When you hear him spew some of the hateful things he says to Julia Roberts' Anna, your own feelings will be hurt. He also has some rather sly moments of wit and he is able to craft them in ways reminiscent of Sean Connery, always with a knowing glint and a hidden smirk waiting to reveal itself.Mike Nichols' 'Closer' delivers dialogue for intelligent adults who are clamoring for something substantially less banal than can be found in most Christmas fare in 2004. It will take a few viewings to fully grasp the complexity and layers of infidelity and betrayal in this film. 'Closer' studies the human tendency toward self-preservation in the face of gross deception. It is at once a condemnation of human nature and an acceptance of it. I highly recommend the film to all literary adults who are fascinated by the enormous gray areas of love, seduction, trust, infidelity and deception. It will appeal to fans of Neil LaBute's 'In the Company of Men', 'Your Friends and Neighbors' and to Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut'.",10,3,6,3 December 2004
Lost in Translation," Everyone wants to be found.
","'Everyone wants to be found.'I love films about 'old souls'.  Sofia Coppola's sophomore effort is masterful in its depiction of two such people, Bob and Charlotte, who find each other in a foreign land, surrounded by hoards of people who seem oblivious to the complexities and possibilities of human connection.Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris, a reasonably famous actor who is a little past his marketable prime.  He is in Tokyo to do a Santori Whiskey commercial, bored out of his mind and feeling tremendously lonely despite the constant attention from fans and advertising execs.  Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a young woman wise beyond her years, who is in town with her photographer husband while he is on assignment shooting a rock band.Bob is disillusioned and slightly depressed... Charlotte is feeling slightly ignored by her husband.  You can tell that both of them are uncomfortable with other people -- They do not make friends easily.  But somehow, after a few chance encounters, glances across crowded elevators and knowing nods across hotel bars, they find each other.  Their conversations appear to be in slow motion when compared with the hustle and bustle of Tokyo nightlife. Everyone around them seems to be so consumed with business, partying, selling, drinking and blabbing.  Bob and Charlotte have thoughtful, meaningful conversation with a shared wit and sensibility that sets them apart from everyone else.  Together, they find those magical moments in life when they feel like they're the only two people on Earth.  And it is all so sad, because it ultimately feels like a film about what might have been.'Lost in Translation' is a great film because it captures those magical moments -- The sly smiles, the inadvertent touches that linger a shade too long, the truly comfortable silences and the secret conversations.  This film is about the little things that most people fly obliviously by while on their way to another meaningless encounter.This is one of the most memorable couples in film history, which is odd when you consider that they are both married to other people.  But Bob and Charlotte are memorable because they connect in ways that married couples are incapable of.  Sure, marriages can have beautiful moments and profound connections.  But they rarely sustain that initial wave of hope, those nervous butterflies, those breaks from the routine of destiny and day-to-day life.  This relationship comes to Bob and Charlotte when they most need it. There may not be a physical connection here, but there is an emotional one that seems to invigorate them and gives them hope to carry on in this lonely world.Consider the scene in the hotel room, as they are about to drift off into dreams, as their conversation meanders, but never wanes.  It is one of the best scenes I have ever seen, beautifully written, masterfully shot. Charlotte blankly states, 'I'm stuck.  Does it get easier?'  Bob replies, 'No.  Yes.  It gets easier.'  She jokes, 'Oh yeah... look at you.'  He says, 'Thanks.'  The final shot in that scene has Bob gently touching her foot as they fall asleep, and mumbling, 'You're not hopeless'.  There is such tenderness in that moment.I love this film.  It is the kind of film that you will want to watch when you need to be reminded that you are not alone.  However, it does require the viewer to provide something.  It demands patience and it also asks that you have at least a minor familiarity with either Bob's or Charlotte's emotions.  One has to be willing and able to admit that marriage is not always the pinnacle of human connection, that sometimes we need a new soul in our lives to provide a spark that might be lacking or lost.Bob and Charlotte were lost until they found each other, and that final whispered moment will remain theirs, and only theirs, forever.  I think that final scene promises, them and us, hope that they will meet again someday, in this world or the next.'Lost in Translation' is one of the very best films of 2003.  It is easy to understand why it is the most critically acclaimed film of the year, making more major top ten lists than any other film by far (Only 'Mystic River' and 'Lord of the Rings 3' came remotely close).  Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson deliver powerful performances, worthy of Oscar consideration. Sofia Coppola announces herself as a major player in the directorial ranks with this film... although her writing may be the more laudable of her talents.  I will be first in line to see her next film.  'Lost in Translation' immediately contends for a spot in my 'All Time Greats' list... it is a glorious masterpiece. -- Critical Mass Movie Reviews",10,0,1,4 February 2004
The Village," A Masterful Storyteller Weaves His Magic Yet Again!
","Four StarsA Masterful Storyteller Weaves His Magic Yet Again! A Spellbinding Old-Fashioned Yarn. A Hitchcockian Flare for Mounting Tension & Drama. A Beautifully Woven Political Fable. A Powerful Love Story. And Those We Do Not Speak Of...There will be NO spoilers in this review!I was robbed today... Robbed of a once in a lifetime opportunity. I was robbed by an idiot projectionist. Only a handful of directors have earned my trust enough to merit an early morning Friday visit to the local multiplex. I decided to catch the very first showing of M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller, 'The Village'. Not only that, but the local AMC had a digital projection copy of the film. I was delighted and eager to see this long awaited movie.I sat down in my chair, having decided to skip the popcorn stand because I am on a diet and because the line was too long. The screen was black... the lights were out... and a handful of other patrons showed up ten minutes early like me. Then, without warning, the screen lit up with a scene of some sort. I wasn't sure what I was watching until twenty or thirty seconds in. I recognized a familiar face. And then the realization slowly hit me... I was watching the very final moments of 'The Village'. The @#$!!)(@@ projectionist was messing around with the frame alignment and had accidentally begun playing the climax of the film. I was furious to say the least, and after explaining to the manager what had happened, I was promptly offered two free passes to any films of my choice in the coming weeks.I was reasonably satisfied with the proposal, but I was utterly devastated to have my first viewing of this secretive film ruined by some pimple-popping moron. It is something that can never be regained unless you live in the world of Jim Carrey's 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.All that being said... I find it even more remarkable that, with the big secret given away, M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' still managed to send shivers down my spine and give me a million goose bumps. It is his mastery of storytelling and mood and pace that has made him such a brilliant director in such a short amount of time. Very few directors have ever had their first four major films be this stellar. 'The Village' may be the best of the lot and is easily one of the best films you will see all year.It is impossible to talk specifically about the plot without giving anything away. So if I talk in utter vagaries, please forgive me. In a village enclosed by mysterious woods, a group of a hundred or so people reside peacefully. They appear to be early American settlers, perhaps pilgrims or an Amish community. The film is very vague about those details.William Hurt plays Edward Walker, the patriarch of this community. He is one of the elders, a group of adults who act as a council for the village. Joaquin Phoenix is Lucius Hunt, a quiet loner who is tempted to enter the forbidden woods. He is thwarted though by the elders who teach of creatures that live in the woods. The creatures are referred to as 'Those we do not speak of...'Newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard is Lucius' love interest Ivy Walker. She is blind but seems to see and feel more than many of those around her. She is a feisty girl who recognizes Lucius' feelings without him ever expressing them verbally. She feels his presence and associates him with a color whenever he is near. There is a touching scene where he finally expresses to her that he only ever feels fear when he thinks she may be in danger. Theirs is a burgeoning relationship that grounds the film with real emotions.I will not reveal the plot points in the final half of the film only to say that due to a terrible circumstance someone is forced to enter the woods and travel to get help. The storytelling techniques that Shyamalan uses in this film are simply brilliant. Unlike his other three films, the focus in 'The Village' is less on the final revelation and 'big twist' than it is on the journey to get there. This film is a masterclass of screen writing and plot development.If there is one quibble I have with the film, it is in the character development. The film could have been thirty minutes longer to give us more clarity in each of the lead characters. But this film is more about story and fable and suspense and mood than it is about individuals. Someday soon, Shyamalan will develop into a brilliant creator of characters... He is already a consummate artist when it comes to creating story and visuals.The acting is uniformly good. Everyone plays their part with stoic aim. The one stunning standout is the revelation of Bryce Dallas Howard. The daughter of director, Ron Howard, delivers one of the best major film debuts in recent memory. She is the emotional anchor of this film and those emotions are played out exquisitely on her gorgeous face. Her portrayal of Ivy is one of the best performances of 2004. I think she should be Oscar nominated. It is clear to me that, if she chooses to follow the film path, we have found a new great actress for the coming generation. What a lovely and inspired find by M. Night!I have read some early reviews from other major critics. Most notably a terribly misguided review from my favorite critic, Roger Ebert. There are other reviews out there who lament that they saw the twist too far in advance or that the film was too somber. I am dumbfounded by their remarks. Did they miss the glorious cinematography? Did they miss the lovely interwoven political message (Which I will leave you to decipher)? Did they miss the tremendous performance of Bryce Dallas Howard? Did they miss a carefully crafted story whose tension mounts patiently? Did they miss the gorgeous use of strings in the soundtrack? Did they miss the fact that this film is so much better than the routine schtick we get week in and week out. Were their expectations skewed by Shyamalan's previous outings?I think that if this was Shyamalan's first film, the same mediocre reviews would be glowing recommendations. This is the classiest of his four great films and his least sensationalistic. He is maturing with each and every cinematic venture. If he keeps up this curve for another 20 years, M. Night will soon discussed in the same breath as Alfred Hitchcock. There are a handful of better filmmakers out there right now, but I can't think of a better storyteller than he.'The Village' is a first rate film. I highly suggest that you avoid hearing details or rumors about this movie before seeing it. I wouldn't want your virgin viewing experience robbed. I think time will prove me right over the Roger Ebert's of this world. This film will stand the test of time and serves as yet another stepping stone to greatness for Mr. Shyamalan. 'The Village' will assuredly contend for a spot in my Top Ten Films of 2004.",10,0,0,30 July 2004
Collateral," 'Collateral' is a professionally made and competent thriller.
","****************'I can't drive you around while you're killing folks. It ain't my job!' 'Tonight it is.'****************'Collateral' is a professionally made and competent thriller. Unfortunately, despite crisp direction from Michael Mann and good performances from both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, the film rarely rises above that level. That the film achieves every one of its goals is not much of a compliment because its goals were set rather low. 'Collateral' wants to provide two hours of low-boil tension with occasional outbursts of excitement as we follow a cold-hearted contract assassin (Cruise) and his unwilling chauffeur-for-the-night cab driver (Foxx). It accomplishes that competently.What is slightly depressing is that the film starts off with some really great character development and has us truly getting involved with the two main leads, but then dwindles into a routine cat and mouse chase that can be seen in any one of a dozen other films each year. It almost feels like the ideas just ran dry half way through writing the screenplay.However, there are many things to like here. Mann is tremendously confident with his camera work. His angles and shot selections will never allow you to look at your wristwatch in boredom. He gives this film a memorable look.I really liked the initial scene with Jamie Foxx driving Jada Pinkett-Smith's attorney character to her office. It takes a while for us to fully realize the significance of that cab ride, but it is a fascinating conversation that is well executed.I also enjoyed both Cruise and Foxx. Their interaction early in the crazy Los Angeles night, as Vincent (Cruise) adapts Max (Foxx) into his deadly plans, was intriguing to say the least. Cruise's performance was typically brilliant, but Foxx surprised me. He really has some acting chops on him. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future.I also appreciated the use of location. Los Angeles is such a vast city... spread out and disjointed. It is rare that a film captures the character of that city the way so many have with NYC. Mann uses the city very well.I suppose the film can easily be considered 'good'... perhaps I would not argue too much with 'very good'. But it stumbles short of greatness because it doesn't set its sights very high. I don't think it qualifies as anything more than mere entertainment or two hours of thrills and I don't think too many in the audience will remember much about it a few months from now.'Collateral' is a solid thriller with a clever premise, a visually inventive look, and a couple of intense performances. It succeeds in what it attempts to do... I just wanted it to do more. I wanted to feel something more... for the situation, the ideas or the characters. Instead, as I squinted my way into the parking-lot, all I was wondering was where I had parked.*********************'You just met him once and you killed him like that?' 'What...

Quantum of Solace," A Bond film that falls short of 'Casino Royale' greatness.
","Let me get the basics out of the way...Great title. Dreadful opening theme song. Boring opening credit sequence. Solid action scenes. Gorgeous Bond girls. Hardly any humor. No steamy love scenes. Unfocused plot.I am still recommending this Bond entry, despite some significant negatives, predominantly because of the strength of Daniel Craig as the 'new' 007. He demands to be considered a more three-dimensional and thoughtful Bond... a man whose actions and emotions have weight and consequences. This re-invention bids a temporary adieu to the overt sexual innuendos and comical gadgetry of the Connery, Moore, Brosnan era (I omit the Dalton era for obvious reasons). 'Quantum of Solace' may not be as fun as many of the previous twenty movies... Rather, it replaces the silliness with regret, pain and vengeance. That may or may not be your deep champagne goblet of Vesper Martini.Picking up just a few minutes after 'Casino Royale' ends, this flick is essentially a sequel. Bond is simultaneously angry and mourning over the loss of his beloved Vesper Lynd... and he wants answers.The film thrusts us into motion with an insane car chase in the curvy hills of the Italian countryside. Once at the safe-house, Bond and M interrogate Mr. White -- the man whom James Bond introduces himself to in the final moments of 'Casino Royale'. However, things do not go as planned when a rogue MI6 agent helps Mr. White escape.The hunt is on as 007 traverses the globe in search of Dominic Greene, the head of an ultra-secretive organization that goes by the name 'Quantum'. They are in the business of destabilizing governments and installing new leadership who will be more beneficial to their interests. Their current target is Bolivia.Along the way, Bond is naturally thrust into the paths of some gorgeous women. One is Camille (Kurylenko), a woman with her own agenda which involves a personal relationship with Dominic Greene. The other is Agent Fields (Arterton), an MI6 employee who is sent to retrieve Bond after he 'goes rogue'.The plot yanks us all over the place before finally settling in South America, where we figure out the true motivations behind Greene and Quantum (the modern version of Spectre).I think of this film as a transition piece. 'Casino Royale' was our first introduction to James Bond - his first assignment, first love, first loss. 'Quantum of Solace' is a somber revenge flick that, by its very nature, has to eschew all the typical humor and wink-wink sexuality. The next film may have us return to the Connery style Bond, who uses women without conscience and thwarts evil with nonchalance. However, he had to go through this movie to find a 'Quantum of Solace' first. This film was a necessary step in the evolution of Bond.I have already professed my glee over the selection of Daniel Craig as 007. He gets it all right. I could not be happier with the choice. I must confess that I am tired of Judi Dench in the role of M. Been there, done that. The role needs to be recast somehow.I would like to see the gadgets return. We had a nice glimpse of an awesome computer interface in 'QoS'... but the requisite gadget scene was always a fun moment to anticipate.Kurylenko and Arterton are undeniably pristine as the beautiful Bond Girls here. Unfortunately, they aren't given enough to do. I would have loved to have had them more involved. Kurylenko is clearly blessed with star quality... She is stunning. Arterton reminds me a little of Rosamund Pike or Keira Knightley -- She is elegant and quintessentially English. I think she has a great career in front of her.However, the flaws in this film lay squarely at the feet of director, Marc Forster. The plot is unfocused... never letting us settle in one place for long enough to gather our thoughts. The choice of opening song and credit sequence are atrocious. He should be fleeced for ruining those most cherished parts of the Bond experience. And although the action scenes were ambitious and packed with energy, I felt that he fell back on the tired techniques of quick cuts and blurred speed to distract us from the logistics of the sequences. To me, this signifies a lack of confidence and a lack of talent.Nevertheless, I still manage to recommend 'QoS' despite it falling far short of its prequel. Not only was 'Casino Royale' the best Bond film ever made... It was one of the best films of 2006 -- it is a very rare feat for an out and out action film to land in one of my Top 10 Lists. This 2008 effort pales in comparison. Is that unfair? Perhaps. 'Quantum of Solace' is a good action film and nothing more.Written by TC Candler",7,0,2,14 November 2008
Batman Begins," I am amazed that I liked it...
","I hated 'Daredevil'. I didn't like either 'Spider-Man'. The 'X-Men' movies were mediocre. I can't say that I remember the 'Superman' movies fondly. The 1989 'Batman' was dull. I hated all the 'Batman' sequels. 'Catwoman' was abysmal.In fact, by my definition, a superhero movie usually equates to a moronic, silly and childish piece of crap designed specifically to make tons of money with merchandising and Burger King tie-ins.I hate them. I hate them. I hate them.In fact, I resent the genre for angling the entire medium of film toward a younger demographic. Every major release in this day and age seems to appeal at least somewhat to kids in order to capture the massive dollar amount that they generate. I say... 'Fuck the kids'! This is an adult world. They can have it later. That's why I almost always appreciate a film that ignores the 13-25 year-old demographic and delivers a literate and intellectual story about adults and for adults.Okay, that rant is over for now...In fact, the only superhero film I even remotely liked was 'The Hulk'. Not surprisingly, it was the one superhero film that didn't do too well with the younger demographic. It was arguably the least financially successful superhero film in the last 20 years. (Not counting the joke that was 'Catwoman').So, I finally arrive at 'Batman Begins', a film I presumed would follow the trend of silliness evident in all the other movies of this ilk.I actually liked it?????? What the hell??????With movies like this, so popular and so familiar, I usually dispense with the plot summary. So I will delve right into the opinions...I loved the look of this film. It maintained the slightly somber feel that accompanies the Batman saga, but it wasn't afraid to venture into daylight from time to time. Heck the first third of the film takes place in the snowy mountains of somewhere or another... I wasn't paying attention.My biggest gripe with comic book films is the lunacy of the plots. I usually cannot suspend my disbelief at all. However, 'Batman Begins' had me from the get -go. I was buying the story... it didn't seem ridiculous to me. SHOCKING!!!Another thing that surprised me was that the villains weren't absolutely ludicrous. Comic book villains are usually so dumb and over-the-top that I lose all sense of belief. Here, they are relatively subdued... I liked that a lot.The only problem I had with the film was the insanely stupid 'Batman Voice' that Bale chose to use. What the hell was that all about? Very silly indeed!The acting was rather impressive all around... Especially from the supporting cast. Only Katie Holmes left me wanting for more. She was rather dull. I liked the turns by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman... they brought some added weight to the film. Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy were both solid as the bad guys. And apart from Bale's silly voice, he was a very good Batman... his face carries the emotional weight of the character and doesn't let the character venture too far into camp territory.I will say this though... Superhero movies by their very nature are not capable of a grade in the A-range. It would have to be tremendous just to merit a B+ from me. The silliness of a man bouncing around in a spandex suit with pointy ears just will not allow me to go any higher. But 'Batman Begins' was about as good as I could have imagined from a film in this genre. I teetered between a B and a B+... but because of the pleasant surprise, I am going to reward it with a B+. 'Batman Begins' is the best in it's genre because it isn't too silly It isn't too campy. It isn't too childish. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It strikes the right balance. It is geared to a slightly older audience than your typical popcorn flick. I had a really good time with this one!",7,18,33,20 June 2005
City of God," The City of God is a very good film about a God-forsaken place!
","This film recounts the story of a young Brazilian boy named Rocket who grows up in and around the 'City of God'.   We follow his life, from a very young age though adulthood, as he narrates all the crazy adventures of his life and describes all the various characters he encounters along the way.  His life is a tough one, filled with horrific violence, incessant theft and rampant drug abuse, which seems commonplace in his world.  More than anything, this is a story of survival in a vicious community that chews people up and only spits them out if they are lucky.  This existence is a vicious circle that seem to inevitably lead to short life or a life spent in jail or absolute poverty.  The only way out seems to be to risk your life in the drug trade where things become assuredly more dangerous.  Avoiding trouble completely is a very tricky accomplishment and we watch as Rocket does his best to make it in this God-forsaken world.  But will he make it without giving in to the temptations of a criminal life?  After all, honesty doesn't pay in the 'City of God'. The film is marvelously directed and edited.  There is a kinetic feel that rivals Scorsese's work in 'Goodfellas'.  That the material is also similar is not surprising.  This film was clearly inspired by the 1990 gangster epic.  'City of God' definitely deserved its Oscar nominations. I am clearly recommending the film despite the brutality and the overwhelming sense of despair that the film conveys.  I usually don't like films that refuse to feature even a glimmer of hope, but this film avoids that pitfall in the final twenty minutes.  I won't reveal what happens, but the film offers a sliver of hope without selling out the reality and tone of the earlier scenes. Based on true events, 'City of God' is a visceral and shocking peek into a living hell that, by all accounts, still exists to this day.  Poverty will always make crime a viable option... a natural human instinct.  This film highlights that fact with brilliant direction and Oscar worthy editing.  I am not sure anyone would want to watch this film multiple times, it's just not that kind of movie.  But I strongly suggest you seek it out on DVD if you missed the limited theatrical run.",Null,1,3,14 June 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A Review of The Spectacular Spectacular Film for the Ages!!!
","This film was more imaginative and vividly inventive than any I have ever seen.  It is a feast for the eyes albeit a hyper-active one.  Each scene is memorable and lavishly spectacular.  The songs are easily recognizable and yet they are, in some cases, modified beyond belief.  The acting and singing is magnificent, Nicole and Ewan can belt out tunes with the best of them. But most of all this film is romantic... it will appeal to lovers of TITANIC and those that loved the innocent romanticism of the Golden Age of musicals. Nicole is at her very best in a daring and powerful role... she is becoming a GREAT actress!  Baz Luhrman follows up on his flamboyant reputation with a film that surpasses all his previous outings.  This is the best film of the past two years and I LOVE IT for being over the top and romantic and beautiful and silly and charming and truthful.  Oscar time is a long way off but this film WILL be remembered for sure.Congratulations Nicole, Ewan, and Baz on a film that will be a classic.",9,0,0,1 June 2001
Garden State," Every now and then you find a song that hits all the right notes.
","Every now and then you find a song that hits all the right notes... 'Garden State' is the movie equivalent of that wonderful sensation.**********Zach Braff brings to life a lovely story filled with wonderfully quirky and adorable characters in such a way that the quality of his directorial debut begs to be compared with Quentin Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' and Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Hard Eight'. Not to say that 'Garden State' resembles those films at all... It is more reminiscent of the 1996 gem, 'Beautiful Girls', also starring Natalie Portman. Braff proves, on his first time out, that he is a genuine filmmaker with a poetic eye and an absolute adoration for the characters he creates. This film will appeal to virtually everyone on some level. It is easily one of the best films of 2004.Andrew Largeman (Braff) is a heavily medicated young man. He is a struggling actor, living in Los Angeles, whose only claim to fame is a role as a retarded quarterback in some lame TV movie. He lives in his medicated haze, far removed from his New Jersey family with whom he rarely speaks. But all that changes when he receives the call that his mother has passed away and he must return to pay his respects for a few days.As I said earlier, this film bares a resemblance to 'Beautiful Girls' in that it is about a man returning to a virtually unrecognizable home only to find old friends and new inspirations. The film also had me wistful for 'The Myth of Fingerprints', a film that dealt with a young man's familial issues, most notably with his father.'Garden State' begins as a rather wry comedy filled with memorable scenes and images that will have you chuckling to yourself long after you leave the theatre. But its true power lies in the way it morphs into an awakening of sorts for the main character. That change is partly due to his medical sobriety but has more to do with Samantha (Portman), a charming and quirky girl who is an emotional torrent determined to open up Andrew in ways he seems incapable of.I loved that this film abandons all tradition narrative arc and becomes a succession of bizarre encounters. It really feels like a 'real' trip home. Braff captures the awkwardness of returning and the uncomfortably of seeing old friends who haven't changed as much as you think you have.The screenplay may be the best of the year. Every scene feels authentic, as if Braff has lived them in his own life. Every character is developed with extreme care and you'll each have your own favorite.The central relationship of the film forms between Andrew and Samantha. It is one of the most heartfelt and charming romances you'll ever have the pleasure of seeing. They share some of the funniest moments and some of the most romantic scenes in recent memory. This couple just feels right together.Braff delivers a nuanced turn here, perfectly capturing the character's arc from comfortably numb to emotional full. He is instantly sympathetic on screen in a way that reminded me of Dustin Hoffman's role in 'The Graduate'. Natalie Portman gives her finest performance yet. Her Samantha is utterly lovable and charming... You'll find yourself wanting to give her the biggest hug imaginable. She is able to capture all the necessary emotions that she needs to give to Andrew so that he can feel whole again.There are a number of nice turns in the supporting roles... Most notably from Ian Holm and Peter Sarsgaard. The entire cast deserves mention as one of the best ensembles of the year.I also want to make special note of the soundtrack which may the best I've heard outside of a Tarantino or Cameron Crowe film. Songs like Coldplay's 'Don't Panic', The Shins' 'New Slang' & Frou Frou's 'Let Go' are an integral part of the movie and set the moods from scene to scene. You will almost assuredly want to add this to your music collection.Every now and then you find a song that hits all the right notes... 'Garden State' is the movie equivalent of that wonderful sensation. It will make you laugh hysterically. It will make your heart swell at the measure of its romanticism. It is the kind of film that will make you want to tell those closest to you that you love them dearly. And any film that can do all that is a masterpiece in my book.",10,0,1,13 August 2004
Pride & Prejudice," It doesn't get any more romantic than this...
","'Pride & Prejudice' was quite easily the most pleasant cinematic surprise I've had in ages. It is easily the most romantic film of the year and it may just be the best.Brits often complain about the repetitive nature of Hollywood formula pictures. They make a valid point despite the obscenely hypocritical tone that tends to accompany it. You see, Brits seem churn out the same seven movies over and over again...Shakespeare adaptation. Elizabethan drama. WWII drama. Literary biopic. British gangster flick. Python-esquire silliness with comedian-du-jour. Austen adaptation.Now, don't get me wrong. They make some truly wonderful films. But their range isn't too daring. They have failed to match the American independent scene in terms of originality, daring and experimentation.So when yet another Jane Austen adaptation comes down the pike, you'll forgive me if I tend to roll my eyes let out a weary sigh.The only thing that peaked my interest for this recent version of 'Pride & Prejudice' was the inclusion of Keira Knightley as the beloved Elizabeth Bennet and Rosamund Pike as the eldest Bennet sister, Jane. Knightley and Pike are two of the loveliest and most talented young actresses of this generation and I was curious to see them try their hands with this poetic material.So with all my trepidation in tact, fully expecting to see a respectable but nonetheless uninspired British period piece, I sat down to watch director Joe Wright's version of the classic tale.Within thirty seconds of the opening, I knew I was in for something unexpectedly refreshing. I had a smile on my face for the next two hours, fully enthralled with the witty trials and tribulations of the Bennet's family struggle to marry off their five daughters to respectable husbands.Austen's prose shines through each and every pore of this film. Keira Knightley and company wrap their skills around every meaningful word and subtle glance in ways that will have attentive and literate fans bursting with delight. It is a delicate, complex and intricate script that will leave the witless behind in a wake of confusion.WARNING: The next bit of gushing will make this very heterosexual critic sound more gay than a Wyoming Cowboy in heat.This version of 'Pride & Prejudice' made my heart soar. I wanted to hug and kiss everyone in the audience, except for that fat guy in the third row. If Keira Knightley's firecracker performance doesn't have you cheering, perhaps the heartbreaking strings and rolling piano scales of Dario Marianelli's wonderfully romantic score will have you in tears.Perhaps Bingley's eventual drop to one knee will send shivers down your spine. Maybe Mr. Darcy strolling majestically through the morning mist toward his true love will have you weak at the knees.Maybe the anguish of Mrs. Bennet's nerves will resonate. Or the kindly recognition of Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet will leave you warm inside.Will the playful interaction of Elizabeth and Jane under the covers as they wistfully dream of true love touch your heart?Will Elizabeth's journey to the edge of a cliff or the spinning solitude of a barnyard swing have your heart aching for a resolution?I don't know what will touch you the most... But rest assured, something in this film will move you. If it doesn't, consider yourself emotionally numb.This is a film for utter romantics. It is a film for connoisseurs of literary elegance and sly wit. These characters spar in verbal gymnastics that will leave your head spinning.If Jane Austen's legendary love story is the engine to this film, Keira Knightley is the fuel. Her performance in the best of the year... from either sex. She bursts from restrained to rambunctious, elegant grandeur to rugged determination. She handles the part like a seasoned veteran who eats Shakespearean dialogue for breakfast. To paraphrase the man, she is more lovely and more temperate than a summer's day, imbuing the silver screen with the darling buds of May.See, I told you this would sound gay!But I don't care. This is the kind of film that can make you feel like that... like love is all that matters in the grand scheme of things.'Pride & Prejudice' is the best film of 2005. It is certainly the most romantic. If you are in that mode where you just need a break from all the typical British period pieces... trust me... take a look at this one. It blows them all away, virtually reinventing the genre... certainly revitalizing it. I had no earthly idea that I would find love in this story... a sentiment shared by the beautiful Lizzie Bennet.",10,13,22,22 February 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Meet me in Montauk...
","How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd. -- Alexander Pope==> I confess to being an idealist and a romantic. This type of film appeals to people like me... the ones who believe in love at first sight, soul mates, destiny, yada yada yada. The Charlie Kaufman penned 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is as fresh and original as some of his other screenplays (Being John Malkovich, Human Nature, Adaptation), but adds a romantic depth that makes this one of the most complete film going experiences I have ever had.There was an exchange during the film between our two leads, Joel and Clementine, played with poignancy and nuance by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, that echoed what I was feeling about the film.Clementine: This is it Joel. It's going to be gone soon.Joel: I know.Clementine: What do we do?Joel: Enjoy it.Luckily for me, I knew I was going to be able to revisit the film many times in my life. The depth of the film manifests itself in the fact that the soul mates, Joel and Clem, both know that their time is running out and that they will never be able to meet again.Most films might choose to highlight this type of heartbreak with the death of a loved one or a bittersweet farewell at a train station. But not Charlie Kaufman. He is bored by clichés. Rather, he chooses to dazzle us with the complexities of the human mind and all of its glorious possibilities. He is a master storyteller that is unlike any other I am aware of.Joel (Carrey) is socially inept. He has had girlfriends, but none that really meant anything. It is as if he has never had a significant relationship of any kind. But, one day, he meets Clementine. 'Don't make any jokes about my name', she warns him. She is wild and kooky, changing her hair color from red to orange to blue to green depending on her current mood. She seems the polar opposite of Joel, but they click. They click in ways even they can't pinpoint. But from the moment they meet, they know there is something special there.However, after a silly argument breaks up their relationship, Clementine decides to visit Lacuna Inc., a company that specializes in wiping troubling memories away forever. She has decided to erase the memory of Joel. When Joel hears this from some friends, he angrily decides to do the same to Clementine, erasing her completely from his mind.The erasing process involves a mapping of the memories and an all night process of erasure that is 'technically brain damage', according to the doctor. The bulk of the film takes place during the process, inside Joel's mind. The most recent memories are first to go and we watch as they slowly disappear into nothingness. Those recent memories are bitter as we witness the arguments and the boredom of their relationship. But as the time rewinds, the memories get better. We travel backwards and watch Joel and Clem during their best moments, loving life and loving each other. As this happens, Joel desperately regrets his decision. He wants the inevitable erasure to stop, but he is completely powerless. Soon she will be gone and he won't even remember that he forgot her. The film focuses on his attempts to foil the process and retain some of her in the recesses of his mind.'Eternal Sunshine' is directed by Michel Gondry who also helmed 'Human Nature'. He has a flare that accompanies Kaufman's words with perfect symmetry. This film bounces around on its timeline almost hysterically, but the director never lets us get lost. We always feel in control of our senses and our emotions. It is a tribute to Carrey and Winslet that they were able to do the same.Jim Carrey has pulled off a rather remarkable transformation that I would have deemed impossible a decade ago. He is becoming a brilliant actor with qualities that resemble Jimmy Stewart and Tom Hanks. He is a fabulous everyman who is sympathetic and knowing, interesting and kind. He deserves tremendous praise for this role. Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in every film. She is easily one of the very best actresses we have. Here she plays against type, and embodies a fascinating woman who craves attention but needs intimacy. Hers is a beautiful performance that will go overlooked. It is easy to understand why Joel falls in love with Clementine.I think fans of Charlie Kaufman will be thrilled with this brilliant entry in to his collection. I think the film will appeal to those who loved the recent masterpiece 'Lost in Translation' or Tom Tykwer's recent beauty, 'Heaven'. It is a romantic fantasy with real emotions and real characters that will resonate with the viewer who isn't entirely closed to sentiment. When Clementine whispers 'Meet me in Montauk' into Joel's ear... it's hard to hold back a tear.This will easily be one of the best films of 2004. It is the antithesis of the typical romantic Hollywood fare. I loved every minute of its refreshing originality. The film has passion and flare and brilliant wit, all framed by an intelligent script that deals in absurdity while managing to maintain an intimate realism. These characters feel real. You root for them. You want them to meet again and give it another chance. It is a film that will only get better over time, as our memory of it waxes and wanes its way into our hearts.TC CANDLER",10,944,1079,26 March 2004
Inside Man," Spike Lee Chooses His Words Very Carefully...
","Have you ever heard someone play the first seven notes of a piano scale... and then stop? It's irritating isn't it? Spike Lee's 'Inside Man' is like a spectacular flash of lightning and the moments immediately after when you are waiting for a thunderous boom... and you wait, and wait, and wait, only to realize that it's not coming.One could safely describe this film as the anatomy of a perfect heist... A bank robbery so perfectly planned that it almost reeks of being too good to be possible. It is the set-up, the execution, the police response, the interplay between the two, the sub-plots and typical Spike Lee touches that make this film one of the finest three-quarters of a film this year. It is just that darn final act which fizzles in comparison to the electric build-up.Clive Owen is rigidly organized and controlled as the mastermind of this bank robbing team. The plan seems simple enough... Dress the team as painters, enter a Manhattan bank branch, overpower the patrons and employees and take the loot. Right? Wrong. It's never that easy, otherwise they wouldn't have made a film about it.Once inside, the cops swarm the exterior, led by the 1950's film-noir-styled detective played with debonair cool and muffled intensity by Denzel Washington. He is an ambitious cop with legal troubles of his own and he knows that this hostage negotiation could be his big break.Christopher Plummer plays the founder and CEO of the bank in question. He is under extreme duress when hearing of the heist because of some very secretive safety deposit box contents that could damage his reputation. He hires Jodie Foster's Madeleine White, a facilitator of solutions to such problems.The story unfolds in ways that would be unfair of me to divulge to first time viewers. Needless to say, there is a David Mamet like complexity to the proceedings that allows for twists and turns and misdirection.The cast is stellar. Washington, Owen and Foster are all in fine form, each delivering a character with wit and insight and each possessing a different kind of power. There is confidence brimming over in this cast. No one feels out of place.What is absolutely brilliant about this film is the way in which Spike Lee manages to build the film to such a crescendo using a very familiar formula. One of the characters even references the classic seventies flick, 'Dog Day Afternoon'. Lee manages to craft virtually everything for the first ninety minutes to perfection. No detail or plot hole is left to bother us. The viewer is crystal clear what is happening and we get a good sense of where every character resides during this stand-off.The only thing we don't know is how the film is going to resolve itself. Unfortunately, it is at that point that we start to realize that Spike Lee may have the same problem. I will not give anything away in regards to the plot, but I will say that the final act is untidy and unsatisfying considering the meticulousness of the build-up.I want to stress that I am absolutely not clamoring for a typical Hollywood ending here. A shoot-out would not be the way to end such crafty thriller. What is needed is a crisp re-write to clarify the positions of all involved... especially the Jodie Foster character.I felt like I was waiting for that chill-down-my-spine moment that never came. The big reveal. Instead, the film felt slightly anticlimactic and predetermined... Like there was nothing at stake all along. I am giving the film a strong grade in spite of that final fade because it had the makings of one of the best films of the year up until that point.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",8,4,6,24 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...
","Admittedly, I am a film person... If there is a choice between reading a book and watching a film, I'd typically pick the film. After reading the acclaimed best-seller by Dan Brown for a day or two, I heard that Ron Howard was shooting the screen adaptation. So, about a third of the way through the book, I stopped reading and waited.Now that I have seen this very entertaining film, I am curious to go back and read the entire novel. I am sure that some parts had to have been left out. And frankly, I am curious to compare the two.This film was quite easily the most anticipated film of 2006... Ahead of any comic book adaptation or summer sequel / remake. I don't believe the validity, but I heard a rumor that this novel was the most sold work of fiction since... well... the Bible. No doubt it was an enormous phenomenon... For about two years it seemed that, every time I boarded a flight, every other passenger had a copy tucked in their carry-on luggage. The film will assuredly be a big success too, making a boat-load at the box office and then exploding into DVD collections.The reason for all the popularity? Quite simply, the story is a fantastically entertaining and riveting one that works on many levels. It can be read as a detective story, a crime thriller, a religious exposé, a conspiracy theory, a puzzle... The complexity and depth are endlessly fascinating.The film is shot by the wonderful Ron Howard, whose résumé is fast becoming one of the most impressive in recent Hollywood history. He is as sure-handed and reliable a director as there is... You can count on him to deliver a fine film almost every time out.The cast is equally impressive. Hanks has been called the Cary Grant of this generation... And he resembles a wrongly accused Hitchcockian character in this film. He is the rock to this film's insanely hyperactive story. He is our focal point and he manages the part superbly.Audrey Tautou is one of my ten favorite actresses. I am grateful for every moment she spends on screen. She handles the English-speaking role with aplomb and is quite capable of carrying the film along with her co-star.There are also a handful of quality roles turned in by Jean Reno, Ian McKellan, Alfred Molina & Paul Bettany. No one lets the film down with a weak performance.The story is so familiar to almost everyone... and I will not ruin it for anyone who wants a virgin movie-going experience. The film begins with a murder inside the hallowed halls of the Louvre. What is left behind is a handful of cryptic clues that will lead to the greatest cover-up in human history and the true source of God's power on earth.Now, of course, the story is controversial in the sense that it deals with religious belief and vast conspiracies. However, anyone that gives this story weight or credibility, by denouncing it or forbidding people to see it, is utterly naive. They'll only add more interest to the members of the public who are waivering. The same thing happened to Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ'. After all, controversy puts asses in seats.Movies are movies... they are not laws or doctrine or factual documents. People should not fear films like these.The book, and thus the film, is complete fiction and does not claim to be anything other than that. It is merely a great suppositional piece of entertainment... and on that level it works spectacularly well.You will find it virtually impossible to be bored during the 150-minute running length... something most 90-minute films cannot boast. This film is engrossing up until the chilling final sequence.If there is any quibble, it is with the pacing. I felt a little rushed while watching all these earth-shattering events unfold. This prevented me from being fully immersed in the story from time to time. It was so hurried in parts that I became aware that I was watching a movie... And that is a big no-no in a film like this.However, 'The Da Vinci Code' works very well and it is easy to see why this story became such a world-wide hit. It is not the type of film to win Oscars and Globes... but it will captivate an audience who appreciates great storytelling, eerie moods, exciting action sequences, whodunit puzzles & surprise endings. This is the cinematic equivalent of a page-turner! -- TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",7,2,5,20 May 2006
The Departed," The Consequences of Misplaced Loyalty & Trust
","Film god, Martin Scorsese has directed his 'hardest' film to date... And that is saying a lot! My own knuckles hurt after watching this film, packed to the rafters with pistol-whippings, face-crunching fists and round-house kicks to the teeth. 'The Departed' is an emotionally paralyzing face-off between the State Police, the mob, and their respective informants / rats, on the cold-hearted back alleys of Boston, Mass.What makes this film so superbly successful is the way Martin Scorsese marshals this complex story into a brisk moving, completely understandable, entirely real piece of cinema that strikes a chord deep inside the viewer. When the final credits start to roll, you will let out a deep breath of relief... One that will feel like it has been held since the first frame of the film.After an initial introduction to the life and crimes Frank Costello (Nicholson), the legendary Boston mob boss, we join the proceedings as William Costigan (DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Damon) are graduating from the State Police Academy. Each near top of their class, they are forced in very different directions when they reach the detective unit.Sullivan is assigned a lofty rank as the star rookie on the force. However, his loyalties do not lay with the boys in blue. He has been quietly raised since his early teens by none other than Frank Costello.Costigan is offered a vastly different assignment. His records erased, his graduation deleted... He is required to go undercover, a plant directly into the heart of the mob itself. After a cosmetic 4-month stint in jail, he is released with a bad reputation and worms his way toward Costello's clan.The film shifts gears and stories faster than you can blink, allowing us to spy on this cat and mouse thriller. The camera acts as our informant. And let me tell you something... Every piece of information this films leaks is fascinating.There are tales of female infidelity, police futility, mob brutality, penile immobility, cell-phone connectivity. OK, I stretched for that one. The story leads to its logical and somewhat inevitable conclusion, taking no prisoners along the way. Every character plays an important part at some point... And not every character is what they first seem to be.Marty Scorsese is masterful here. He may just have earned himself another Oscar nod. He is going to get one someday... It probably should be for this film. His camera flows like no other director's ever has. It is kinetic and forceful, a perfect match for the characters and the story.The cast is just about as good as it gets. If you were still on the hedge about Leo -- Forget about it. This is a master craftsman at work. His intensity and power is every bit a match for Jack Nicholson's efforts. In fact, there are scenes where Jack disappears behind Leo's force.Matt Damon is fast becoming a great actor. This is his most complex role to date. He imbues Colin Sullivan with a conniving intelligence that has the police looking in all the wrong places.Alec Baldwin has long deserved Oscar recognition. He should get a Best Supporting actor nod here as the Police Captain. He has one tremendous moment where he raves about the Patriot Act... It is a superbly satirical jab that I presume may have been his own ad-lib.Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Vera Farmiga & Ray Winstone round out the first-team cast with the utmost class. I am sure this film will be considered by the Screen Actor's Guild for Best Ensemble.I cannot imagine any sane human being watching this film and not placing it in their year-end Top 10 List. 'The Departed' is so raw and so heavy-hitting that it doesn't stop at your eyeballs, it rips right to the core of you. It is the most involving film of 2006, so far. It is the most supremely crafted film of 2006, so far. It is the best film of 2006, so far. And I doubt whether I will see a handful of films the rest of the way that will challenge it for the top spot.Â© Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",10,2,6,6 October 2006
Love Actually," Love is all around us... all the time!
","'Love Actually' is jam-packed with storylines, jokes, romances, kisses, heartbreak and various forms of love. Ninety percent of the film works brilliantly. Only a few scenes are awkwardly inserted but they are soon forgotten by the time the next good one rolls around. Rarely will you have ever seen a film crammed with so much stuff. Apparently the original cut was almost four hours long and, for obvious reasons, the director had to do some serious trimming. He managed to get it down to about two hours and ten minutes. The film could have been virtually perfect if it had been an hour and fifty minutes.The premise surmises that love is all around us all the time... that to find it, one only has to open one's eyes, especially if you are at the arrival gate at Heathrow Airport. This film displays virtually every type of love: The burgeoning romance of a Prime Minister and a member of his housekeeping staff; The slightly fading love of a married couple in their fifties; The love of a stepfather and stepson for each other after the mother has passed away; The love a man feels for his best friend's new bride; The love of an author and his Portuguese maid with whom he cannot communicate; The love of a sister for her sick brother; and the love of various other crazy characters who long for and lust after those around them.There were a few threads that weren't particularly interesting. The story about the aging rock star trying to get his Christmas record to number one on the charts and the story about the young British lad who dreams of heading to America to find beautiful women willing to sleep with him were both a tad belabored and repetitive despite producing the occasional laugh.However, most of this film bounces us energetically from one silly scene to another, with a few stops along the way to introduce some weighty material. I like the way that 'Love Actually' balances all its material and rarely seems to inappropriately connect a frivolous scene with a profound one. The director does a marvelous job of stirring the ingredients without turning it all into mush.This movie follows the tone set by so many recent British romantic comedies like 'Notting Hill', 'Bridget Jones' Diary' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. But instead of focusing on one particular romance, there are almost a dozen to choose from. 'Love Actually' is a perfect date movie that will be easy to watch over and over again with a loved one. It may be rated R for a little gratuitous nudity, but it can be watched by teenagers too. The MPAA proves yet again that they obscenely think that sex is grossly more heinous than blood-curdling violence. I would have no problem showing this film to a fifteen or sixteen year old.I highly recommend this romance-fest despite a few clichéd scenes and few unnecessary threads. There are a ton of belly laughs to be had here and a couple of tear-inducing moments too. I found the 'Christmas Caroling Bob Dylan Cue-Card' scene to be quite touching, in part because I think Keira Knightley is perfect too! 'Love Actually' is a delightful mix that will be a romantic favorite for years to come.",Null,0,2,30 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," In the end, it is still corny tripe made for six year-olds and nostalgic thirty-somethings.
","Last night, a friend offered to buy me a ticket to a midnight showing of 'Star Wars 6' (And yeah, yeah... I know about the episode order -- I just do it that way to irritate you). The idea initially sounded like hell on earth, what with having to deal with fanatics and their silly masks, pretend Darth Vader helmets and plastic lightsabers. I almost said no. But I am not one to pass up a free movie... after all, going to 100+ movies a year gets expensive! This sixth 'Star Wars' probably ranks as the third best in the series. The original and its sequel only surpass it. And as hard as it is for me to say, there are many things worthwhile in 'Revenge of the Sith' *Lets out a giggle*.I thought the special effects were state of the art in many scenes... although in others I felt that I had seen them all too often before, like the way old cartoons use the same backgrounds repeatedly to cut corners and save effort. But the flight scenes in this film were quite outstandingly done.I felt that the storyline, although predetermined and highly unsurprising, was well paced and had a logical arc.I liked a few of the lines that were clearly inserted by Lucas as a jab at today's American government. I didn't think Lucas was capable of such innuendo. However, the rest of the script was as dismal as we've all come to expect from these kiddie flicks.I was very disappointed to see as many lightsaber duels as we did... the parade of glowstick battles was tiresome.There were also the prerequisite half-dozen cringe inducing moments of utter corniness. I went to a midnight showing with some very devoted fans and even they let out a few embarrassed laughs at unintended times.If you can keep a straight face when Palpatine and Windu face off, or when Darth Vader pulls a Brando and screams 'Noooooooooo!!!' to the heavens while punching the air... well, then good for you.No doubt the same will always be true with the fanboys... they will defend this movie, even praise it as one of the best of the year. Why, you ask? The answer is simple... because they want to like it. It doesn't matter what appears on the screen... if it has the words 'Star Wars' in the title, they are bound and determined to like it. Sort of like the way Ebert is bound and determined to like Jennifer Lopez or Angelina Jolie movies.'Revenge of the Sith' *Lets out another giggle* is exactly what you expect it to be... it has a little more weight that the previous two dreadful installments. And with that weight comes a better story. The acting is uniformly abysmal... with minor exceptions from Natalie Portman and the CGI Yoda. The script is, well it is a George Lucas script. And the special effects will be special for a year or two before they become out-dated.I will admit to liking the film better that I expected to. It is the best of the recent three. But in the end, it is still corny tripe made for six year-olds and nostalgic thirty-somethings.And if you think you have seen the last 'Star Wars' movie... then your picture appears next to the word 'gullible' in the dictionary. Look for Star Wars #'s 7,8 & 9 sometime around 2012-18. I mean, how on earth could George Lucas pass up the opportunity to have Darth Vader do more Burger King commercials???",4,2,5,19 May 2005
The Good Shepherd," We are all boot-makers to kings.
","'The mental facility to detect conspiracies and betrayal are the same qualities most likely to corrode natural judgment.' Almost every year, there is one great film that slips under my radar. I usually wait for it to hit DVD because it keeps getting passed over for other films I'd rather watch. However, when I finally get around to seeing it, I wonder to myself how I ever let it pass me by.In 2006, that film is Robert De Niro's 'The Good Shepherd'. Here is a cinematic gem that hits all the right notes. It is a study in detail. It is a master-class in mood and tone and style. This movie is a fascinating character study and a riveting story of trust, loyalty and betrayal -- both personally and politically.Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a gifted young man whose keen intellect and sharp observational skills soon catch the attentions of some important people. While attending Yale University, Edward is recruited into the uber-secretive college society known as the Skull and Bones. During the initiation ritual, he is asked to recount a secret that he has never before revealed -- a pledge of trust and brotherhood. He describes his father's suicide as a result of being a disgraced naval officer.The FBI becomes aware of Edward's abilities. His encounter with a poetry professor only serves to expedite his venture into the world of espionage.Edward's ties to that secretive community cost him his first love, Laura, a beautiful young deaf girl with a heart of gold and a pure spirit. Instead, a relationship seems forced upon him with Clover (Angelina Jolie), sister to one of his fraternity colleagues. An unplanned pregnancy rushes along the marriage plans. It becomes a loveless relationship between strangers.The film follows Edward's life, shifting between the 1940's and the 1960's, counterbalancing the eager early loyalty with the paranoid, lonely and resentful man he becomes later in life. 'The Good Shepherd' is a finite analysis of a man who knows what the important things in life are (family, love, friendship, parenting), but substitutes them for patriotism and duty -- perhaps as a way of restoring his father's honor.What De Niro does so well is to patiently, rather microscopically, dissect Edward's life in the world of intelligence. Every detail of this man's soul is laid bare for us to see. It allows the viewer to respect and pity him at the same time. It is probably the greatest cinematic exploration of espionage ever made. We are privy to this character's very core.Consider the multiple virtuoso sequences in which the CIA lab technicians systematically analyze a fuzzy black & white photograph in conjunction with a low grade audio tape. It is a fascinating study in detail that serves as a microcosm to the entire movie. De Niro's legendary attention to the details of his portrayed characters has quite obviously transferred to his directing. Everything of value in 'The Good Shepherd' lays in the subtle moments... the momentary glances... the uncomfortable silences... the verbal hints and clues.Also note the fabulous exchange in a covert London counter-intelligence office between Matt Damon and John Turturro. It is a fantastic exercise in screen writing, rapid rhythmic delivery and understated, yet mesmerizing, acting. It was wonderful to watch the 'Rounders' duo reunite and square off with some great dialogue once again.This may be De Niro's epic creation, but in terms of acting, this is Matt Damon's film. What he achieves here is nothing short of... well, nothing short of De Niro at his very best. Damon picks the bones of his character clean. It is a performance that establishes him as one of the greats of a generation. None of his contemporary peers can carry the face of solemnity and gravitas quite as powerfully as he. This role is Damon's 'Raging Bull'... albeit a quiet rage. This is the best performance of 2006... from either sex.There are many fine supporting roles on display. Most noteworthy are the turns by Alec Baldwin as the all-knowing FBI agent, Tammy Blanchard as Edward's regrettably lost first love, and Michael Gambon as the wise professor who has been in the game too long. It was also a welcome sight to see Joe Pesci in a feature film for the first time in a long while. The entire cast is first rate -- an obvious sign that De Niro knows how to cast a film with actors as precise as he.This film truly captures how lonely it must be to work in the intelligence community, especially at that time. Half way through the film, Edward receives the news that his first son has been born. The resulting phone call to his wife is interrupted by air-raid sirens and horrible static. His wife asks if he is busy saving the world. He replies, 'Sometimes. What color are his eyes?' When the line is cut off before she answers, we empathize with Edward's decision to sacrifice his own happiness for the good of his ungrateful government.When Edward unexpectedly runs into Laura, some years after their college romance, she confesses that she often wonders what life would have been like had they stayed together. It is a poignant scene, filled with regrets of what might have been.I watched two other films in the past week that were within touching distance of greatness. 'The Painted Veil' and 'Goya's Ghosts' were both in need of a little more patience -- maybe they were afraid to go much beyond the two hour mark for fear of being commercially unviable. At two hours and forty-five minutes, 'The Good Shepherd' goes the extra mile, resulting in a complete filmgoing experience. Quite frankly, it is an unassailable masterpiece.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com.",10,49,65,6 April 2007
The Terminal," Starts off great... ends up languishing near mediocrity.
","Steven Spielberg's 'The Terminal' begins with a nifty premise, rife with possibilities, but he allows it to drift away into the schmaltzy realm of feel-good comedy and cheesy romance. The first half of the film is often intriguing and consistently amusing in its originality. Based loosely on the true story of a man who was forced to live at the Charles de Gaulle International airport in Paris, this film works best when it focuses on the specific details of Victor Navorsky's (Hanks) day-to-day life surviving in the airport lounge. It is a fascinating predicament to have someone caught in limbo, not allowed to enter the United States and unable to return to his home country (the fictional Krakozhia) which doesn't exist anymore. But the film falls apart after it has exhausted the original premise and delves into romantic and comedic subplots which fail on virtually every level.The film manages to remain barely recommendable because of a laudable performance turned in by Tom Hanks. He is fantastic as Victor Navorsky, the everyman who barely understands the language and will do anything to abide by the rules laid out by the head of airport security, Frank Dixon (Tucci). Victor is a good man who carries around a secretive can of peanuts whose contents remain a mystery for the bulk of the film. He doesn't have any money but he manages to cope by using some very ingenious methods. It is fun watching him navigate the airport, making his life as comfortable as can be given the circumstances.The surrounding characters, however, are the downfall of the movie. Tucci is asked to play Dixon as a one dimensional caricature, solely obsessed with making Victor's life a living hell. There is no nuance or humanity in the role and it feels like a bad-guy character from a Jean Claude Van Damme action movie.Catherine Zeta Jones plays a highly unlikable love interest for Victor. She is a flight attendant and the other woman in a love triangle with a married man. She can't seem to break away from the destructive situation. At no point did I ever really buy into Victor's emotional attraction to her. Perhaps his interest is based solely on sexual attraction, which would be understandable given Zeta Jones' legendary beauty. But if that is all there is, it is hardly worthy material for a movie romance.There are other minor subplots involving some of the airport employees, including a grossly unrealistic and thinly explored romance between an INS agent and a food services driver. You won't believe a moment of that cheesy tale. There are also a number of appearances made by an Indian janitor that are meant for comic relief. The first time you see him is mildly amusing. The second time induces a minor chuckle. The 37th time you see him will make you want to stand up and throw your popcorn at the screen. Spielberg overuses this mediocre character gag beyond belief.Like I said, the only time this film is successful is when Hanks dominates the action. He lifts this film from cheesy schmaltz to passable entertainment with a pleasant message. And, amazingly, he manages to do this despite the efforts of Spielberg whose typically recognizable directorial signature is completely missing from this film.Spielberg goes for cutesy all too often in this movie. It is enough to make an experienced filmgoer roll his eyes and cringe. Usually, Spielberg manages to be one of the stars of his own films. 'The Terminal' feels like it could have been directed by Gary Marshall or Nora Ephron. I half expected a Meg Ryan or Kate Hudson type to come along and fall in love with Victor at the end.This isn't a bad film, but it is disappointing considering the vast talent involved. Half of the film is meritorious of a B+... the other half deserves a D+. Hence, I give it my most average grade of C+ as it teeters between interesting character study and cornball romantic comedy. 'The Terminal' is best suited for television viewing rather than costly trip to the theatre. And that is something I did not ever expect to say about a Steven Spielberg film.Critical Mass Movies - www.tccandler.com",Null,0,1,18 June 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.
","Truly a masterpiece of cinema.  I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by.  Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film.  How did it not win oscars galore.  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story.  A love of hope, a love of friendship and a love of life, no matter the constraints.  I LOVE THIS FILM!",10,5,8,12 May 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," I cry every time I watch this film. This movie is perfect.
","There is only one film better than this masterpiece... TITANIC.  It is truly a moving and glorious story about what is most important in our lives. Friendship, love, hope and belonging.  The roof-top scene is one I will never forget.  The acting by both leads is subtly magnificent.  The script can throw you into tears at any time.  It is not simply a prison flick or a buddy flick.  I find it amazing how many people feel the same way I do about this film.  I've read the comments and over and over again the same words... The best film of all time.  Of course, time will tell it's legacy... it is still very young.  No one went to see it when it came out but people have discovored it over the years.  Word of mouth has transformed this quiet film into one of the most praised films ever.  Congratulations to all those who were a part of the making of this film, and to all those who have the soul to understand it.  Old souls will love the film.  Steer clear if you like Bruckheimer films... this slice of cinematic beauty is not for you.  I LOVE THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION!!!  I am a better person for having watched it.

Raging Bull," You Know You Are Watching A Film When You Are Watching Raging Bull.
","So many films today are TV shows stretched out to fill a cinema wide screen, not literally of course.  They seem to have lost the 'art' of the art. Not so for Mr. Martin Scorcese.  He is simply a master of his craft, and demonstrates that best in this classic 'FILM'.  It isn't a 'movie' like so many other efforts we see every year.  The film watches like a musical... taking us through the life of man... telling all the nuances that are him. Jake la Motta is made known to us through this film... not just shown to us. A beautiful film that all should watch.",10,2,3,4 October 1999
Casino Royale," Why is he the man he is?
","'Casino Royale' returns to the beginnings of the Bond saga, answering the question that has lingered in the background of the action packed series for forty years. The fact that it answers the question so emotionally and comprehensively makes this the best Bond film of all time. After all, when you get a glimpse of Eva Green as Vesper Lynd, it isn't hard to understand why 007 evolves into an emotionally detached killing machine with a twinge of sarcastic humor to numb the pain. Losing any girl that beautiful would break any man's heart. How, and why, he loses her would turn most hearts to stone.Daniel Craig steps into the legendary role with all the swagger and charisma required to make the legion of demanding Bond fans entirely satisfied. He is a chiseled and grizzled version, more reminiscent of Sean Connery than either Moore, Dalton or Brosnan. It will take three or four more films before we can accurately compare and contrast... but he knocks this first effort right out of the park. He is brilliant. But more on him later.The story begins, quite literally, with Bond, having just been promoted to double-0 status, 'executing' his first mission. His first kills as a servant to MI6 are the intro before the much anticipated musical opening. It is strange how renowned and beloved these Bond openings have become over the years. 'Casino Royale' delivers one of the best Bond tracks ever recorded (You'll Know My Name - Chris Cornell) overlaying a very retro-style graphics sequence that plays with the theme of playing card suits. Look for a gorgeously subtle touch hidden in the Queen of Hearts!!! The only thing missing from the sequence was the silhouette of a naked woman -- I thought that was part of the deal with these sequences? This time around, Bond is on the hunt for Le Chiffre, a man who weeps blood and is fiercely determined to get his hands on over $100,000,000.00 -- whether it is via stock market fraud or an insanely high-stakes game of poker. When the first option is thwarted by our secret agent, the cards begin shuffling and the large-denomination chips begin rattling.James' financial contact, who fronts him the $10 million buy-in to the expensive game, is the elegant and classy Vesper Lynd -- a mental equal to Bond and the woman who holds the key to dismantling his armor. She is played by Eva Green, one of the most naturally beautiful and sexy women I have ever seen on the big screen. She first came to my attention in Bertolucci's recent masterpiece, 'The Dreamers'. Green is an actress so quintessentially French that she makes her other countrywomen seem merely French-Canadian. Not that there's anything wrong with French-Canadians! Needless to say, there are twists and turns, explosions and stunts, Martinis and cars -- this Bond film doesn't fail to deliver any of the expected goods. Although one of the famous verbal landmarks we have come to expect doesn't appear until the final moments.What this movie does so supremely well is to humanize our previously impervious hero. He is in the early stages of his double-0 life and this is the story of HOW he becomes Bond. It is a brilliant touch that adds a layer of pain and depth to a character generally considered shallow.There is an emotional weight to this story. There is a physical weight to the action sequences. Nothing feels fluffy and insignificant in this film. It is, without question, the most impactful movie in the entire series.I cannot say enough about Daniel Craig. If this weren't a Bond film, I would have the balls to suggest that he should be considered for an Oscar. After all, it ain't easy to step into this role and add something that no other actor has managed to even try. For the first time, I actually thought of 007 as three-dimensional... as vulnerable... as a man capable of true love. Which leads me to Eva Green...Eva Green makes all other Bond girls look exactly that... girls. She embodies Vesper Lynd with intelligence and power and conflict and an uncontrollable sexiness, all of which serves as Kryptonite to James. Again, she is not content with providing a night of passion and few double-entendres... Vesper is a real character, and she needs to be, in order for us to accept James Bond's transformation.Even the bad guy in 'Casino Royale', in spite of the clichéd facial scar, is less cartoonish than found in previous installments. Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre with a calm understatement that shuns the over-the-top antics of other Bond villains. The high stakes poker game, and all that surrounds it, is perfectly composed by director, Martin Campbell. None of it ever crosses the line into cheese or camp.Everything about this movie smacks of authenticity. It really feels like something massive is at stake... And no, I am not talking about the fate of the world... I am talking about the fate of a human being. 'Casino Royale' is a bitter-sweet Bond film, delivering all the typical treats, but offsetting it with a meaningful love story and vulnerable characters who are affected by the loyalties and betrayals of others. This is my favorite Bond film. It is one of the best movies of 2006. I cannot wait for the next chapter -- After all......James Bond will return.© Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",9,1,4,17 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The story is just a little too silly to carry the emotional weight of a masterpiece.
","Okay... here goes.  I am preparing myself for another year of vicious, profanity-laden and hysterically defensive e-mails from the rabid fanatics who refuse to believe that these 'Lord of the Rings' movies aren't beloved by everyone.  I have received well in excess of five-hundred such emails, while only receiving forty or fifty in support of my views.Obviously, I am in the minority in this particular case.  Only 17.2% of IMDb users gave the first two films anything other than an 8, 9 or 10 out of 10. Four out of five people, who regularly go to the movies, really like these films.  Some are so obsessed with the film that it borders on a cult-like following.So lets dispense with the bulls**t.  To save yourself some time... if you feel like sending one of 'those' emails, just type in the word 'ditto' and I will get the message.  Alternatively, you can be at peace with your rabid fanaticism and use your time more wisely... perhaps attending a LOTR convention dressed as your favorite character and rolling your R's when you talk to your fellow geeks.I am also going to dispense with the plot summary... Everyone has seen it anyway, and it will just feel redundant.  Frodo and Sam are walking, Aragorn and Gimli are fighting Orcs, New Zealand looks beautiful, Gandalf glows -- Yada Yada Yada.I will admit this however... 'The Return of the King' came as close to a recommendation  as any of the three.  I even toyed with the idea of pushing it over the edge just to avoid at least some of the hate-mail.The final thirty minutes of the film did enough to evoke tears from my eyes, partly from relief, partly because it was very sentimental.  If the previous ten hours of material had felt more like the final denouement, I would have given the films glorious recommendations.  Those last minutes were gentle and kind and emotionally powerful... it actually felt like Tolkien's work for a change.The best acting in the entire saga came in that final act.  The one that stood out the most was Sean Astin as Sam.  Sam acts as our 'witness' throughout the film and I got choked up watching his character in the final scenes.Like I said... I was close to giving in to this film, but I just couldn't do it.  There were too many corny scenes, too many lulls, too many overwrought speeches, too many special effects.  Don't get me wrong, some of those battle scenes were spectacular, but they also never seemed to end.  I felt more exhausted than exhilarated after having watched them.  And interspersed throughout the film were a couple of musical numbers, that felt very out of place, along with a few intended 'tender' moments that seemed awkward and melodramatic.Can I give Peter Jackson any praise at all?  Hell Yes!  He must have worked his ass off for years to make this project happen.  The amount of thought and coordination and organization that went into all of this must be mind-boggling.  I respect and admire his accomplishment, but I think he was the wrong man for the job.  He was concerned with the wrong aspects of the trilogy... the action, the adventure, the battles and the gore.  He didn't focus on the kinder and gentler aspects of the story -- the hobbits, the friendships, the beauty, the innocence, the childlike imagination... but, of course, that would not have sold as many tickets at the box office, now would it?  I think his limited and gory experience as a director hurt him in this regard.  This was 'his' version of the trilogy... but 17.2% of us didn't really share that vision.Will this third installment win the Oscar this year?  Probably, but I certainly hope not.  I agree with Roger Ebert who said, 'That it falls a little shy of greatness is perhaps inevitable. The story is just a little too silly to carry the emotional weight of a masterpiece.'Will this third installment surpass 'Titanic's' mammoth box office tally in the US and around the globe?  No, not even close.  You could add any two of the three film's worldwide gross and their tally would not add up to that of Titanic's total alone.  LOTR is a huge box office success, but it won't change the industry in any substantial way.  Perhaps we will see a few attempts to emulate the success with more fantasy adventures... it will probably become a fad like the recent Marvel Comic adaptations.Will this trilogy go down as one of the 'All Time Greats'?  Probably not. I don't believe that this film will hold up over time, even with its strongest fans.  Movies with special effects of this nature usually seem dated after a decade or so, as technology continues to improve beyond our wildest imaginations.  There are rare exceptions of course... but even Star Wars' fanaticism is petering out slowly... and that was the most popular fantasy adventure ever made.  'Attack of the Clones' made $120 million less than 'Phantom Menace'.  I doubt that the last installment will even reach $250 million domestically.The fact is that people grow up... they grow out of this sort of thing... it fizzles away into nostalgia.  Most films that truly last and stand the test of time are based more in reality than in 'Orc-world'.  That doesn't mean that a film like this can't be a wonderful diversionary escape, a fun trip to the theatre.  But it does, in all likelihood, mean that it won't be remembered as a masterpiece of filmmaking.'The Return of the King' is the best of the three... I really liked the final scenes, the farewells, the tying of the loose ends.  But it still falls short of the Middle-Earth that I wanted to see, and thus I cannot rrrrrrrrecommend the film.",3,3,8,9 January 2004
V for Vendetta," Remember, Remember, the 11th of September...
","This film is flexible. No, perhaps the word is versatile. 'V for Vendetta' just may be the one film from 2006 that has the most varied interpretations, the one film that will stir more thought and debate than any other. It is so much more than the typical comic-book / graphic-novel big screen adaptations that over-populate the cineplexes and rental chain shelves. This one has ideas... Pertinent and timely ideas written by and for a complex mind.'V for Vendetta' was on a short-list of about two-dozen films that I was most excited to see in this calendar year. In any given year, I am delighted when half of those anticipated hopefuls turn out to be cinematic gems. This is one of those to treasure. It is thrilling... entertaining while it offers new avenues of thought. It keeps the engine in constant motion while still delivering dialogue that waxes poetic about the nature of government, art, revolution, rebellion, fear, terror, war, trust & courage.I must admit that, going in, I wasn't sure that this film was going to live up to its lofty goals and incredible advanced buzz. I mean, how often does any film deliver on such... let alone one with a lead character sporting a mask? Somehow though, 'V' compels us to compare, to judge and to answer the questions it poses. And it does it with a flare and grandeur that will make you edge closer to the screen, if only to immerse yourself further.The film is hard to describe with a standard plot recap. The film and the characters evolve, constantly changing the starting line... So where to begin? V (Hugo Weaving) is the codename for a masked and cloaked man hell-bent on being noticed by the people and by the government. He practices vigilante justice, whether rescuing a damsel in distress on the future streets of London, blowing up a governmental building, or killing off those who wronged him in the past. Depending on your point of view, he is either a revolutionary or a terrorist.Evey (Natalie Portman) is said damsel in distress, rescued by V when she breaks curfew and runs into an unseemly band of law enforcement agents. The two of them are bound together by circumstance and ideas. There is an undeniable connection of fate between the two.The plot is counting down to 'Remember, remember, the 5th of November', a reference to Guy Fawkes' attempt to blow up the houses of parliament some 400 years earlier. On the next anniversary of that date, V has vowed to exact his vengeance by finishing the act thwarted all that time ago.The overpowering government rouses into motion its police state tactics to seek out this man before his plan can take root in the consciousness of the people.The similarities and references to our time, our government and our current world climate will not go unnoticed by any but the thickest dullards. It is quite obvious why this film is being made now. There are clearly messages to be heard here. Some may say the graphic novel could not have been about that, as it was written solely with references to the Nazi party... and was merely forewarning of the dangers imposed by 'Thatcherism' and the like.That may be true. But this film was made and released at this time with direct references to the war in Iraq, the hideous nature of the Patriot Act, the torture and murder of civilians, the hunger for power and control by the use of fear, the idea that government may not always be on our side... all of these themes and many others point an accusing finger directly at you know who.There is only one performance in the film that I'd like to highlight... that of Natalie Portman. The rest of the cast is adequate. V's is hard to judge because of the mask, although Weaving is tremendous at delivering the lines with conviction. I mentioned earlier in the review that there was a short-list of films in 2006 that most intrigued me. That list includes 4 films starring Portman, who has overcome the rather embarrassing inclusion in the disappointing Star Wars debacles to emerge clean on the other side with a sublime résumé for any actress, let alone a 24 year-old one.The four films she has coming out this year are 'Goya's Ghosts', 'Paris, je t'aime', 'Free Zone' and, of course, 'V for Vendetta'. I urge you all to seek those films out because she has already proved to me that she can command the screen with emotion so raw and intense that it never fails to transpose itself to me in the audience.In this film, despite bouncing back and forth with the English accent, from lower-class yob to upper-class royalty, she is able to become the sympathetic vehicle the audience needs in order to undergo the same transformation that Evey experiences. The best lines in the film are delivered by Hugo Weaving's V... the best reactions and emotions are delivered by this simply brilliant young actress. There are less than a dozen actors or directors whose films I refuse to miss on opening day. Portman has earned her way onto that list.This film is about ideas. Granted, they aren't new ideas, but they are ideas that we need reminding of in times like these. Like the lead characters in the film, I have hope that enough people will eventually grasp on to those ideas and make the changes necessary in order for us to shed our fear, seek out the truth and reclaim the freedom to choose our own destiny.'Remember, Remember, the 11th of September!'",10,2,8,17 March 2006
