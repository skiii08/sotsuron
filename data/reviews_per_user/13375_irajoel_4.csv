Scarface," Scared For Life
","I can't really understand why Brian DePalma felt the need to do a remake of Howard Hawk's 1932 gangster masterpiece Scarface. The original is so good and tough, lean and stark, short and to the point. This laughable mess goes on for an unbearable three hours, and has as its centerpiece, it's anchor, its star, Al Pacino who is simply dreadful. What has happened to this once exciting actor who gave so many memorable performances in the early seventies. His downfall may have begun with this very film, and he has gone downhill ever since. All his recent roles & performances seem the same, they blend and melt into one. His performances have become lazy, fat and dishonest. At times it seems as if his performances are yelled at us, and this is usually mistaken as intense and powerful acting. When he tries to be subtle and quiet,he comes off as insincere and all method. He was fun in Dick Tracy, because he was playing a cartoon, and his overacting was exactly right for a comic strip. His performance was all make-up. His Oscar for the cheap & sentimental 'Scent Of A Woman' was undeserved, but as Oscar saw it he was long overdue. So in Scarface we have Al playing gangster with a bad Cuban accent which comes off as a bad Mexican accent. DePalma & the screenwriter Oliver Stone have change the Italian criminals of the original to Cubans, and instead of booze we have coke, instead of the fine subtle Hawksian direction of the original we have De Palma's over the edge misdirection. To be sure DePalma has made some terrific original films. Carrie, Sisters, Dressed To Kill and The Untouchables immediately come to mind, but Scarface is not one of them. There is however one top notch DePalmian sequence and thats the chainsaw in the motel bathtub scene, but thats only a few minutes in a three hour flick. The violence and gratuitous cursing wears us out, and after awhile it all becomes meaningless and stupid. I envy Michelle Pfeiffer who in the film gets to walk out on this mess. Also in the cast is F. Murray Abraham, one year away from winning a best actor Oscar and oblivion, & Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who in the flash of a snort goes from being a good sweet girl to a raging party girl,unconvincely I might add.  The film also looks ugly and the recently deceased John A Alonzo's cinematography is muddy and common. Not exactly a highpoint of American cinema.",1,40,86,4 June 2001
Taxi Driver," Mean Lean Scorsese
","Hot summer nights in New York City,rain soaked black patent leather streets shine and glisten as a lone, looney & lonely taxi cab driver stalks the streets in his bright yellow cab. This is Martin Scorsese's taxi driver played by Robert DeNiro, at the height of his powers as an actor. He's so young, taunt & handsome & totally out of it, in a totally out of it city. DeNiro plays Travis Bickle (great name) who we see in a series of memorable scenes is a time bomb ticking away, ready to blow up in society's face. And even though we know the big bang is coming, we are still shocked, surprised & disturbed by the bloody ending. This was Scorsese's second big time Hollywood feature, done after his light but very likeable 'woman's picture' 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' which won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar. This is a young director's movie, exciting,dangerous & full of great images & scenes, that exhibit a willingness to take chances which mostly pay off big time. It's also a scary movie, an urban horror show for real. The city of night in this movie is both beautiful with neon colors reflecting on wet streets, and ugly in its deprevation and decay. The film is 'religious' & spiritual taking us along for the anti-hero's long dark journey through hell, both internal & external and his violent and bloody redemption. This Scorsese landscape is littered with human garbage: child whores & pimps, criminals & politicians, crazies who want to do terrible things, politicians who want to get elected. This is a beautifully made and crafted film, full of memorable lines & images. Gliding taxis with steam rising from the streets, Bernard Herrmann's last great score, jazzy and mournful rides along for the trip. Notable performances by little miss Foster, before she became the Oscar winning movie star, rigid & uptight. She's so good eating her toast & jam, trying to sex up Deniro, slow dancing with Harvey the greasy pimp, that we almost think she's the real McCoy, a miniature Mary waiting to be saved. Also good are the already mentioned Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks as the campaign worker luckless in love with blonde venus Cybill Shepherd (also never better) & the director himself as the taxi passenger from hell,who wants to do terrible things to his cheating wife's private parts. This guy is so bad & creepy that even Travis is frighten. Also of note is Michael Chapman's candy colored cinematography & the gorgous Diahnne Abbott (married at the time to DeNiro)in a bit part as the porn theatre cashier. Although I'm not crazy about the epilogue ending,(was this used to make us feel better?) this is still one of the great films, if not the greatest film of the 70's, and one of Scorsese's masterpieces. Hard to believe that he did not receive a best director Oscar nomination, and that the film itself lost out for best picture to the simple and sentimental Rocky. Well actually maybe I shouldn't be surprised.",10,0,0,6 April 2001
Judgment at Nuremberg," judging Hitler
","Yes the film raises serious questions about Nazi Germany and the role that Germans played in the terrible destruction that the third Reich wrecked on the world, but the film is seriously dated and terribly preachy with some very over the top acting and in your face direction. Kramer's direction is obvious with lots of zoom shots and close-ups and is also terribly stagy and slow. Maxmillian Schell in a very overrated performance plays the defense lawyer, and his work is no where as good as Paul Newman's stunning performance in 'The Hustler.' Schell won the Oscar that year over Newman, but his performance is all one note or two. Judy Garland and Monty Clift give some depth and feeling to their small cameos, but both also have done much better work through the years. I will say that Dietrich was terrific in her small role and Tracy was also fine and low keyed as he usually was. The worst performance was given by Burt Lancaster who was way to young to play this part with any conviction and had to depend on his badly done hair and make-up to give any feeling that he could come up with. You can see how bad he is in his big confession scene at the trial and also his stance,posture and walk are all wrong, and way too young. I also had trouble with the static camera work and the poor art direction and process shots, and the throwing in of actual concentration camp footage was a cheap shot and the only real emotional moment in the film and points up to how badly directed the it was. The view outside the courtroom never changes and the trees and foliage look way to fake I know this is minor criticism but it makes the film look tacky and cheap. At times the film resembles a television drama which in fact it originally was. The film was a big critical hit in 1961 and received an amazing 11 Oscar nominations include one for best costume????. This was serious stuff with a capital S back then, and was the verso of the other big reserved seat film of the year 'West Side Story.' If you couldn't get in to West Side you went to see Judgment which made you feel like you had done something good and worthwhile with your 2 bucks.",2,15,40,26 February 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," Leone's masterpiece
","Its inconceivable to me, how anyone viewing this great film in its 4 hour version could not be moved, excited & ultimately overwhelmed by it. From the opening with that Goddamn ringing phone, to the last shot of a smiling stoned out DeNiro this film is a true work of art. Complicated & personal, Leone weaves an epic tale about a bunch of Jewish gangster-friends from their criminal childhood on New York's lower eastside in the 1900's to the 1960's. And like many films of the genre,Once Upon touches on the themes of friendship, loyalty & betrayal but does so in what some find an unsettling structure. The film constantly weaves from past to present and back again & I think that this form of filmmaking makes some American moviegoers uneasy. They like their films with beginnings, middles & hopefully happy endings. Now this is a film that is all over the place, with characters that come & go impolitely & age without aging. Leone the artist takes a sacred genre and does marvelous tricks & turns to it. Its also a very violent & sexy film, a little too 'European' for a mainstream American film, so the film is butched down to a 2 hour version that gets bombed by critics, and hated by audiences who came expecting another Godfather sequel, because hey after all DeNiro is in it. Also in the film is James Woods & the always great Tuesday Weld. The music is by Ennio Morricone & the beautiful cinematography is by Tonino Delli Colli. I'm delighted to see how many positive and interesting comments this film has gotten here, and I too can't wait for it to be on DVD. There is also a longer version than the 4 hour one, in which Louise Flecher has a part, I've seen the stills.",10,7,13,4 April 2001
