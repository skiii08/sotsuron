Requiem for a Dream," Relentless, and brutal.
","Talk about one of the most relentless films I have ever seen. There are few films I will almost turn off because they are brutally relentless, but not in anyway form or shape a terrible film. This takes the cake.The film focuses on a family of two. A mother living with seeming no purpose at home, and a drug addicted son. Ellen Burstyn plays the mother, Sara Goldfarb, who is addicted to a TV Show which seems to be about losing weight. Her dream is to be a contestant on the show and when she receives a call that she is to appear on the show she becomes obsessed with being able to lose enough weight in order to fit into a red dress which she envisions wearing on the show. At first she tries a diet which becomes too painful. Then she here's about an easy way, pills. She goes to the doctor, who is tell-tale disinterested, and begins to lose weight as well as her mind.Meanwhile her son, played by Jared Leto, Harry Goldfarb, is becoming more and more sucked into an impossible to break addiction to drugs. Along with him in his addiction is his friend Tyrone C. Love, played by Marlon Wayans, and his girlfriend, the ever beautiful Jennifer Connelly. Their story parallels everyone else's as they are headed in one direction with no hope of breaking their path or even slowing.The film is painful, expertly told and no holds bar. Darren Aronofsky, the director, tells this powerful and depressing story with an intimacy that is disturbing. Did I enjoy this film? Not at all, but that doesn't diminish the power of this film. I am completely torn. I can't find flaws in the film itself other than my reaction viewing it. A part of me wants to mark this film as terrible and another part a masterpiece. My grade reflects this.",8,1,2,22 January 2007
3:10 to Yuma," Subdued Western Powered By Characterizations
","Now I would like to clarify before the rest of my review is read that I have not seen the original off of which this film is based so my review will not be a comparison there, but I will in the future try and watch it to have a basis for comparison. So this review is of this film as a stand alone.This film is subdued. Like Christian Bales' character Dan Evans, the film has spurts of sustained adrenaline, but nothing full fledged. It takes its time to open up revealing character for the main ones, but leaving the rest to fend for themselves in two dimensional roles. That is fine as it fleshes out the main character very well and makes for a nice ride and adventure sort of a character study than a thrilling western. There is one man to keep the flare very much alive throughout though and that is Ben Fosters' tough and good for nothing puppy dog of a side kick Charlie Prince. He's the mean tough and detached bad guy of the film. Russell Crowe as Ben Wade has to provide the psychological bad guy of sorts, but there are plenty of bad characters in this here western. Not the least of which are several of the captors escorting Wade like Tucker who has his own bad faults like burning down a certain someone's barn in the very beginning. Still though, I would call this the best western in quite a long while for its characterizations alone.And I would say that is because of the heavy presence of Crowe and the subdued approach of Bale which adds an interesting dignity to each. The film isn't over the top, but subdued not feeling like a hard R film at all outside of a gruesome wound in the stomach and a splattering of language that is so minimal it quickly forgotten. The film also has a very good story to work with, one of redemption and heroes which also doesn't loose sight of realism and has quite fragile characters. You may be able to see most of the film coming, but it is enjoyable because of the delicacy it takes in getting there.Spoiler Alert:I felt sorry for many people at the end and not the least of which is Charlie as he is betrayed for coming to help Wade. For that it and the knowledge that Wade will probably go free anyways it is not a completely satisfying ending, but a realistic one. I will probably have a better judgment to make a solid grade after I see the original.",9,4,9,2 September 2007
In Bruges," Redemption and Regret
","The trailer for this film would suggest fair like 2007's Shoot 'Em blood bath with a bit dark sense of humor. Instead, this film is totally different. No fast killing starts off this film, but a bit of profanity and a strangely tortured main character named Ray, who is supposedly a hit man. Things do not become crystal clear until about midway and then things take off crescendos to a slam-bang finish full of blood, but that is not what makes the film. What makes the film is its bitingly sharp sense of black humor where characters are mean to those around them trying to get away from their own problems. I never thought I would come away impressed by a Colin Farrell film, but this film made me immensely mirthful and laugh hard than I have for a while over this winter season of films. It is sad, but has a nice message packaged inside, which takes its time to get to the surface.",9,5,11,10 February 2008
Juno," Quirky, Humorous and Tad Risqué
","Quirky, humorous although a bit touchy, dramatic, and a bit risqué with it subject matter this film walks a fine line between a being a distasteful teen comedy and smart comedy with a strong center of drama based around family and relationships. I will admit the beginning was a bit off humor wise, but stick through that rough patch and it will draw you in with an especially strong outing by young Miss Page. She is the core of the film without her slightly off beat sense of humor and strong will the film would probably fall off track. The surrounding cast is finely cast with Leah, Juno's friend being a bit more teenagerish than Juno, offering a funny sidekick and J. K. Simmons having a strong base as the rather rough around the edges father who ultimately cares about his daughter no matter what. Really the film did disappoint a bit from the hype, but that was to be expected. It had an off beat sense of humor which made for some great laughs and some strong drama moments making for a good balance, but nothing astounding. If there is anything to be loved about this it is Page's shining performance.",7,1,7,5 January 2008
Spider-Man 3," Second Best Entry
","Last year about this time, I was supremely excited about X-Men 3 or The Last Stand as it is titled, but I was supremely disappointed. It had a bunch of action and thin story. It butchered the series for me. I glad to announce this film didn't have the same affect. I was more wary this time, yes, but also still excited. The writers handled the story very well and there was plenty of eye popping action. Still the film lacked a good strong drive like its predecessor.I will address the short comings first. I will point out the obvious. Kirsten Dunst can't sing very well, but that is addressed in the film. The thing is that we have to hear her sing twice, a very bad idea. It wasn't the most pleasant thing to hear although she is decent. My next point of minuses is the origin of the symbiote. It just falls from the sky. A rather weak way for it magically appear, but they had few options other than go with the Ultimate origin where it is man-made. Still little more cause for its arrival would have made it stronger. My third and final point is in regards to the final ending. It was needed at all and added nothing to the progression of the characters other than for a happier note to end on.Now onto the positive stuff of which there is a mass. First the stupendous battles, and let me tell there are some big ones. They were very well staged and brought to being. The final battle especially did a great job of bringing everything together. The special effects are dazzling especially Sandman. The first appearance of his is pure film magic as we see the cells change in Marko's body and the reconstruction after being turned into sand particles. Venom was great to, but nothing spectacular aside from the 'Alien' moments.Before I go on praising this film I will provide a brief description of the plot. Picking up from where the other film left off, MJ and Peter have finally gotten together and things are looking fantastic for Spider-Man and Parker as he has the girl of his dreams and has the city on his sides even the newspaper, a shocker. But things quickly go south when Harry Osborne swoops in and tries to kill Parker as revenge because he believes Spider-Man/Parker's to be the murderer of his father. He looses not only the battle, but his memory after taking a few nasty hits. Flint Marko is then brought on the scene as a misunderstood runaway convict. Through crazy chance he falls into a test area and is turned into the Sandman. Parker is mad at Marko at this point because he believes him to be the true murderer of his Uncle Ben. I won't reveal much more, but Venom/Eddie Brock does have a pretty big part in the last section of the film as does the symbiote about half way and a little before when it falls from the sky. All in all, it is a nice setup for some serious encounters/fights.The relationship between Mary Jane and Peter Parker is pretty key to the film as it drives much of Peter's personal decisions and problems. It's done quite well, aside from Mary Jane singing. Peter wants to ask her to marry him, but it doesn't work out. Aunt May has some great moments in here where she really shines. Everyone is back and more. Jameson is as steaming mad as ever and provides quite a few laughing fits involving his temper. Even the great theme is used to great affect from beginning to ending, something that was sorely missing in the last X-Men film.The film is one of the best entries in the series, but not quite up to Spider-Man 2 which was pitch perfect and never stumbled for a moment. It successfully engages three villains with Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but it doesn't quite resolve everything as grandly as Spider-Man 2 did. Still far from a disappointment which is sure to please most everyone action wise and for those romantic fans it will frustrate you.",7,23,50,5 May 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A Visual Delight as Advertised
","As advertised a visual wonder with the usual wry and a bit whimsical humor to it like the first film. This is one of those comic book adaptations where my only association is through the film, but that is alright. Guillermo Del Toro has a passion for making great entertainment and this is no exception be it that it is a bit wink wink and corny near the beginning with the animatric action and stiff Hellboy, as young boy, look. There is a lot that reminds me of Pan's Labyrinth in here, but I think it is the addition of the latest addition to the team, Johann Kraus, that makes it worthwhile, a good foil at times to Hellboy, the loose cannon. As usual Abe is a great side kick and friend to Hellboy. Their beer drinking scene was tops with the humor. All around this is film to enjoy for its fantastic visuals as well as the wry humor and action. The area it suffers the most in though is the villain department. The villain is not as menacing as the last one and it comes back to the theme of where does Hellboy belong, with these magical creatures, with the humans, in hell watching the world burn? I look forward to the third film though which is implied in the ending from this film.",7,2,6,11 July 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," A true meshing of fantasy and reality.
","'Beautiful and exhilarating, A fairy tale for grown-ups' so Ebert heaps praise on this visual wonder. Many others praise this film with similar phrase, but I will settle to call this one of the greatest blends of fantasy with realism. Keep the kids at home. This film may have a child at the lead, but it hardly for the eyes of the children.Guillermo Del Toro has crafted a film that is at times disturbing and others magical, but throughout the setting is never really lost. We are constantly in shadows. The moon is often the source of light and the being that surround us are strangely human. The setting is postwar Spain and the woodlands where a war still wages between gorilla troops and the army lead by a strict captain. Into this world of deception, brutality, and regimen living comes the free spirited Ofelia, and her mother, Carmen who is pregnant. As the story unfolds Del Toro quickly whisks Ofelia into a world of fantasy, but never fully relieves the tension and brutality of the real world. This world is a horrible and made so by the devilish Captain Vidal. There may be a connection between him and the hideously looking faun, but I had to give that idea up. The film isn't what it often seems and the fairy tales not as innocent as the ones normally brought to mind in children's books. This is an adult fairytale, but it still has a heart.Ofelia is charmingly and disarmingly played by Ivana Baquero. She has the look of an Alice in Wonderland, but with far more at stake than being lost. She plays the full range of emotion expected of any actress and carries it off the innocence of the child to carry the majority of the film. For the rest of the film there is Sergi Lopez and his evil Captain Vidal. While his character isn't given much characterization, it is sufficient to get across the weight of his character who can speak for himself without an introduction. He doesn't like complications and has the sword to put to rest any problems. He is menacing in every scene even until the end. But he is matched in the real world by his own housekeeper Mercedes who is played brilliantly by Maribel Verdu. She may not look it or even at times act it, but she is made of solid stuff. She acts as Ofelia's protector in the real world a role which her mother cannot fully keep as she is pregnant and disabled for the majority of the film.While the characters and actors root the film in reality the art direction makes for an incredibly foreign feel at times, but the place is never in question as the characters resemble many dangerous and beautiful things of which we are familiar. Still the costumes especially the fauns are amazing. Doug Jones voices the faun and I suspect acts the faun.The film is true meshing of fantasy and reality. Guillermo Del Toro doesn't relent in story or vision and made the most visual stunning film this year. I loved the story, the look, the sound, and even the feel of this film. In short this film captured my heart and stands as one of the best of this and any year.",10,5,11,21 January 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Surprisingly Great Moral Story
","Wow, just wowI did not expect Ben Affleck to be such a potent film director. His acting was just mediocre at best for me so I avoided this because of that, a little biased on that count. Nevertheless, he proved me very wrong. He crafts a fascinating tale of a detective hired to find a missing child whose mother is a cokehead. It seems a bit offish at first why he would take this job, but the pleas of the sister are quite convincing. With the whole police force looking it looks like he is not needed, but as it turns out he is the key to it all. Things are not what they appear at all and that slowly becomes apparent despite best intentions. What drew me in so well to this film was the main character played brilliantly by Casey Affleck. He is soft-spoken, but seemingly confident and yet humanly afraid. His sense of right and wrong is what I liked most though. It was such a sincere performance. Add to that a great story full of gray areas through which this character has climb and it stands as one of the best of the year.Spoiler Alert: What struck me as so great was that it not only unraveled like a very good mystery, but all that it was hauntingly real bringing back all these news reports of missing children and the tragic endings to those tales. In fact, he becomes involved in a similar spin-off tale with a tragically killed child, which eventually leads to the unraveling of the original case. It would not have been possible without his moral compass as it were, which would not let it rest. Moreover, it was the rightness of the ending and the heartbreaking reality of who gets to choose that makes this such a great film to me. He does the right thing and yet loses practically everything from his partner to the money, but it feels so right and he knows it.Great film",10,0,0,24 February 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Fantastic Conclusion
","The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.The film starts out in a flurry as Bourne is running from the Moscow police. The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off. Or does it? The time is a little muddled here, but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things. A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. They aren't his target. From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well.The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything. The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two. And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies, but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot. All in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.",10,104,164,3 August 2007
Predator," An Adrenaline Pumped and Testorerone Driven Action Film
","Arnold Schwarzenegger is Dutch, the ultimate soldier, and Kevin Peter Hall is the Predator, the ultimate hunter species in the universe. This film is the result of these two fighting machines meeting up in the middle of the dense jungle of Central America. It is adrenaline pumped and full of testosterone driven action and simple characters. I mean that in a good way. There is not much doubt about the plot. It is a simple mission of extraction for the government with the usual red tape of it being something else, but what makes the film unique is the addition of the curve ball of the alien being who is invisible and slowly stalking and picking off each of the highly advanced commando unit.It is here that the film has it's greatest strength as Arnold, at the peak of physical prowess goes up against the biggest and among the ugliest aliens you have seen. To have to highly powerful characters go at it fantastic for the film as it gets the most action as possible out of these two large hunters. The Predator relies on stealth for the majority of the film which give it the advantage for the ¾ of the film, but when Arnold is on his own and figures out the Predators weakness the roles are reversed for a bit of the ¼ part of the film where the playing field is evened.John McTiernan does a great job balancing the views as he creates some suspense for the first half by not showing the creature itself but his silhouette in the jungle foliage behind its cloak of invisibility. He even shows quite a few shots from the point of view of the Predator who seemingly only sees in infrared which gets even worse when he takes off his mask toward the end.The film is an action packed thrill ride, which has plenty of action and plenty of one liners from the ever marble mouthed Arnold who can say the line, 'Get to the chopper!' like no other. None of the sequels can match this film for its action or even storyline as Predator 2 has a weaker hero and seemingly weaker Predator.",9,1,2,10 May 2008
Ratatouille," Rat Film 5 Star
","Leonard Maltin in his glowing review of this Ratatat film calls Pixar, 'a class by themselveswho have carved a niche for itself like no other.' I agree completely. Every one of Pixar's films have an amazing quality which haven't been broken so far as yet. On top of being an animation studio at the pinnacle of greatness, Pixar also has to offer the best time at the theater with their shorts always preceding their films. Thus they offer a full night at the movie theater not seen since the classic days of cinema.Ratatouille did practically the impossible for me. It matched and even exceeded most of my expectations. It had humor, a great story line, and moral message about being all that you can be and not being afraid to succeed or tell the truth. On top of that, it had some of Pixar's best animation to date. The views of Paris are exquisitely detailed and the details of the kitchen fantastic. But even more so the characters most especially the rats have a great look and feel to them that make them lovable even though they are well rats.The story revolves around Remy, a rat with a keen sense of smell and taste who can't stand his life as rat which in his mind is equivocal with a thief. Remy draws strength from ads he sees of a famous cook named Gusteau. Although Gusteau is dead, he draws strength from him and even has an invisible friend in this Gusteau in his own mind. Gusteau then becomes basically a way for the audience to see the inner workings of the mind of Remy. Things really take off for Remy when he is separated from his family of rats and runs into the garbage boy of Gusteau's who can't cook, but is willing to work with the talented Remy to gain a name in Gusteau's restaurant. Neither have it easy as Linguini, the garbage boy, is looked down upon by the scheming master cook of Gusteau's, but a good villain is always needed even if he isn't a completely bad fellow. Another antagonist for our heroes is Anton Ego, a critic of the highest quality who sunk Gusteau establishment in the first place leading to Gusteau's early death. Ego isn't a true villain and has interesting depth, but what else can be expected of a character voiced by aging legend Peter O'Toole.Ratatouille is another gem from the Pixar studio and not likely to unsaddled as the best animation the year. In fact this is among Pixar's best ventures yet.Note: Fantastic exotic score by Michael Giacchino which evokes that Paris style.",10,4,6,30 June 2007
No Country for Old Men," 'You don't have to do this.'
","'You don't have to do this,' repeated words in this lingering film, which really does not feel like a typical Coen Brothers film to me. Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natured intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard. Jones too was good in a strong supporting role as a close to retirement sheriff who is on the outside shaking his head at the carnage and mayhem unleashed by the simple finding and taking of a satchel full of money.The real gem and glue of the film though is Javier Bardem's menacing character who has his own brand of justice, which is extremely harsh and well insane. Even the one who claims to know him cannot even begin to stop or even slow him down. Bardem whom I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything before is gold and like no other before looks to have the supporting actor award locked up in this performance. His presence is felt, even when he does not show up. That is something I have not seen in film well since probably The Third Man and Orson Welles' character Harry Lime.I cannot really describe the film that well so I will suffice to say that is best modern western tale I have seen since The Three Burials of Melquiades, which also happened to have Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by him to boot. Another thing I noted was the lack of strong score. The filmmakers just seemed to let the sounds of the creaking boots and the desert landscape speak for the film. It felt natural and a bit menacing.",10,394,675,16 November 2007
Schindler's List," Hope through the Death
","'This is very cruel, Oskar. You're giving them hope. You shouldn't do that. *That's* cruel!' Hope, that is the key to getting through this powerhouse film from Steven Spielberg. He holds not bar on showing the violence surrounding the Holocaust and in that he could have gotten bogged down in despair, but he keeps the pacing a flurry like his most frantic works and creates well-defined character who despite being horrifying to degree, especially Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth, offer some glimmer of humanity.The time is 1940's and the war is gripping Europe and in Poland the beginning of the Holocaust has occurred as the Jews are herded into a Ghetto to live a very limited life for time. Into this time of despair and exploitation comes a showman of sorts, Oskar Schindler who sees an opportunity to make a fortune from the misfortune of the Jews. He first builds a rapport with high officials in the Nazi army, knowing later he will need their support. Next he offers the Jews with something left their option to having hope of some life after the war. He does this with the help of a Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern who becomes both his conscience and his friend. As Schindler is building a well off business off of cheap Jewish labor, SS officer Amon Goeth comes in to jump start the process of concentration camps for the Jews and it is he how heads up the Liquidation of the Ghetto.The film chronicles the whole journey of all the characters from the start of the Holocaust all the way to the end of the war and it does it expansively and personally taking note of many excruciating situations most often leading up to death. The film is held together by a fantastic timing by Spielberg which mixes grief with hope and death with life. Add to this some of the best performances of the modern age from Liam Neeson as a towering Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as the odious and delirious Amon Goeth, and Ben Kingsley as the conscience of Schindler, Itzhak Stern, and you have one of the most powerful movies ever made.Liam Neeson performance is great because it has such a great transformation that he expresses brilliantly and almost brings you to tears by the end. He starts out as an indifferent business man, a profiteer intent on making his fortune. But he ends up getting very close to his works and thus gaining a heart which is broken by the end of the film by the horrors he witnesses. On the other hand, Ralph Fiennes performance offers different strain of powerful as he pulls the string of the evil character as he shows a sadistic taste for killing from the start. When he first arrives in the film he is approached by a Jewish Architect who informs him that they need to rebuild a building because the foundation is not right. He takes a second to look over what she tells him and then and tells his officers to shoot her. Even though her advice he does heed, having them rebuild it after shooting her in the head, he says he could not tolerate dissent. It is terrifying performance as he hides his love for a Jewish maid by repeatedly beating her. Finally Ben Kingsley performance offers the purest of the performances as Kingsley plays the straight arrow, the man ever with the heart from the beginning to the end showing an ever willingness to do what he can to make life easier for his people. He is Schindler's conscience in forcing him to see the hope his enterprise is effecting for the Jews.The film is shot in a stark grain of black and white thus tempering some of the violence, but it is still extremely potent as the cinematography gets into the faces of the people showing their etched emotions as well as the horrifying deaths of so many. Streets filled with bodies and ash ridden streets.This stands as one of the most emotionally draining films ever created and is technically outstanding from the powerfully moving cinematography to the softly straining score by John Williams and the towering performances.",10,9,13,22 June 2008
The Incredibles," Fantastic Animated Family of Supers
","Pixar managed to lead the pack of 3D animated films early and each of their films I found to be quite original and fun, but this infusion of superheroes with their incredible talent for tweaking stories ever so well has remained my far and away favorite. This is how in my mind the great Fantastic Four should have been transferred to the screen instead of the shallow film we got awhile back. The Incredibles deals with family issues and quarreling in a way that gets through to both adults and children it is wonderful. Being a student of animation myself I found this film to be an incredible achievement with its ability to use human like forms and animate them so well. Brad Bird who not only directed this, but provided the incredibly hilarious voice for Edna Mode created a wonderful family of supers that we can love and feel for their rather different problems. It was also wonderful to here that jazzy smooth score by Michael Giacchino.",10,0,0,9 May 2008
I Am Legend," Emtional, but Flawed Sci-Fi
","Will Smith is a charismatic actor whose career has spanned a lot of sci-fi films from Men in Black a sci-fi action comedy to I, Robot to Independence Day, his breakout film. But this latest film by him is a bit daring with him being a man against the world, or rather alone against the world. It could be compare to being a Cast Away, but in deserted city instead of a island with only a dog and manikins as company. As a drama this film flourishes with Smith taking on all the deep emotional trauma of trying to stay sane in a silent world with only his own voice to keep him sane. But as a science fiction film it is hampered by jumps of logic which do not quite click.The story is that the world has been infected by a virus. A virus originally designed to cure cancer which it seemingly did to begin with. But everything went wrong. It seems the doctors forgot to read the fine print. The one that reads side effects may include rabid behavior, a lust for blood, aversion to sunlight, etc Well I guess in any good zombie movie they do not see it coming although these zombies seem to be more like a mixture of zombie and vampire. Anyways, this virus not only turned people into these horrid creatures, but also killed a great portion of the world's population and the rest that were not killed by the air born virus died from the being torn up by the dark seekers, as the people in the film call the creatures infected with the virus. Anyways, it is three years after these events rock the world that we find Robert Neville, Will Smith, working tirelessly to find a cure as well as stay alive in a New York City over run with dark seekers.It is here that the storyline thrives by focusing on Neville and his struggle to hold onto his humanity. He treats his dog, which has not been infected but can be, like his child. In a few touching scenes, he prepares dinner for the dog and tells him to eat the vegetables which of course the dog does not. He also sets up a video store with manikins to simulate a familiar environment for himself. He talks to some of them familiar and others like the female ones with a bit tentativeness as he would to woo a girl.The film is full of action as well after good deal of development which gives it a strong base before actually meeting these fearsome dark seekers in the pitch blackness of a building. I do not want to reveal too much about the sequence, but it will get you on the edge of your seat.I have talked a good deal about the pluses of this film and I am a bit loathed to tear it down, but the effects are split in this film with half being great and half being so-so. The great being the effects for the overgrown city which has been slowly overgrown by vegetation and wild beast with deer flocking through the city and other more fearsome beasts. The so-so effects are on the dark seekers who can easily be distinguished as computer generated.Other flaws in the storyline also bring down the film on account of the slightly unbelievable turn toward the end and the intelligence of the dark seekers themselves which do not really make all that much sense. Still though, the film is headed by a strong performance from Will Smith which helps bring this film above average and gives it a strong emotional edge.",7,1,3,21 December 2007
Children of Men," A provocative and artistic science fiction thriller.
","I will admit that I am far from the biggest fan of hand-held camera-work. The Bourne Supremacy's shakiness annoyed me to no end and almost ruined a great film for me. Here the camera-work is much better as it serves to make us a player in this provocative and artistic science fiction thriller. It took awhile to get over the initial shakiness, but then my sense of balanced kind of became attuned with the picture being shown.Now that I have what has been called the greatest part of the picture covered and nothing to great to say about it, well my review would seem to be a downer on this film, but it a ways from it. The film is a top-notch science fiction film with the premise and dystopia society that is shown in the film. Once again like in the year's earlier release, V for Vendetta, the government is putting a full show of strength, but this film takes a few more hits at society, which I don't agree with, but I will let fly for the sake of entertainment. The biggest hit it takes is against immigrant deportation and the guarding of the border. It is a tough issue, but this film shows it in an extremely narrow view. The deportation is shown as brutal, inhumane, and a government cover-up, kick the immigrants out to appease the people. The immigrants are the scapegoats. Perhaps that is one view, but at least show the other side. Well enough politics.I want to judge this film as science fiction film. It's entertainment value. It is a thrilling film. It is anchored by rugged Clive Owen, who has a problem with keeping his feet covered. He is an unlikely hero. He has lost his cause, his way, his hope, his child. Yet it is he that his former wife, trusts. Julian Moore is great if short in her performance. She is the leader of the group and the group that has found a pregnant woman, but she doesn't trust anyone, especially the government to take the proper care with pregnant woman and her child. It is a desperate situation in a seemingly hopeless world.Among these dire and uncertain times Alfonso Cuaron, the director, has Owen's father portrayed by hippie Caine who adds a much needed sense of humor to this at times deeply depressing film. Caine is brilliant as usual and quirky although I didn't mind his musical taste.While I point out all these great things for the film, I must comeback to one other gnawing problem. I had this problem since I saw the trailer. The premise always bugged me with the fact that woman can't conceive babies. The film offers no solution, although, no one seems to know anyways, although Caine offers several suggestions. I had a big pain accepting and buying into this idea, but by the end I had to some degree.The film is intense thriller with a great sense of where it was, great concept design, great actors, and to some degree strong cinematography. But it had minor flaws here and that that made me question the reality as well as purpose of such a film. I would call this the artistic equivalent of V for Vendetta, which made it slightly better film overall for me because of the actors involved and the great characters they portray.",7,2,6,22 January 2007
The Dark Knight," Where do I begin?
","Where do I begin? The film was hyped ever since reviews started filtering out about Heath Ledger's final performance. The film, as well as his performance, has been lauded. I was slightly skeptical, but still highly anticipating film and my expectations were very high. Well they were met and exceeded. I have to agree with those reviews comparing it to The Empire Strikes Back. It is that equivalent to the superhero genre. The overtones are darker than Batman Begins, which was a great stepping-stone for this incredible and epic storytelling of two masterful nemeses for Batman, The Joker and Two-Face. However, the film did not get lost in the dark and still holds a great sense of humor to alleviate much of the pain of the film.To begin with, Batman is having troubles carrying over from the first film. The narrows was lost and he is still trying to collect the criminals who escaped including Scarecrow / Jonathan Crane in small cameo appearance, which really was only weak point of the film. For a villain given so much story time in the first film, it felt disappointing to see him carelessly tossed aside here as he was at the end of Begins. I digress on that, matter though as it is overall a minor disappointment. As he is finishing business with Scarecrow it also shown, that Batman has inspired others to follow him in his 'vigilante' activities. He is not pleased at this. It is not what he intended when he donned the mask. However, the vigilantes inspired by him are not the real beef.The Joker and first the mob is the first beef. Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon are cracking down on the mob hard forcing them to launder their money to one man. Pounding them into a corner, this proves most deadly for a city already having major problems. Into this deadly net waltz the ultimate in chaos theory. The Joker, a mad hatter and the anti-thesis of Batman, who not only follows not rules, but also has no qualms about doing what Batman will not, kill and kill without remorse. He is a mad man and sadistic and still one the enigma he is from the comics, something that Jack Nicholson had ruined for him back in 1989. Unlike him, Heath Ledger is aloud to play the role savagely and therefore, cannot be compared to Nicholson's lighter Joker. He is unto a class all his own in the Batman universe. Anarchy and madness that is what Ledger plays Joker as and deftly too, as advertised a complete screwball whose actions have no rhythm and no bounds. He is the showman of the film, but overblown. Still one cannot help but laugh with him as the film goes up to the point when he kills.While Joker plays the villain of the film, the film offers three main lead heroes whom through the course of the film are tested to their limits by the Joker bound by none. There is the incorruptible Batman, the stalwart James Gordon, and the newcomer District Attorney Harvey Dent. All played just as well as Ledger's Joker making the film are a fantastic film to watch as the four men butt heads. Individually they do it with the Joker as well as together. It is the heart and soul of the film. The three heroes most especially Harvey Dent represent the goodness of Gotham. That is something that is tried to the edge by the Joker. It is through the performances of Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Aaron Eckhart that the film flourishes dramatically.Extraneously on the side, there is the love triangle between Bruce Wayne, Rachel Dawes, and Harvey Dent, but only alongside the main one of the heart of the city and the triangle of Batman, Gordon, and Dent. Above all Gotham is what must survive and that is what Joker makes at stake as much as Ra's al Ghul did in Begins. Therefore, the love story takes a back seat, but it is not overlooked in the 2 hours and 40 minutes that the film runs. It covers a lot of ground with lots of twists and turns and it does not miss a beat and way to tie up a loose end, save for Cillian Murphy's ever suffering Scarecrow.The technical makeup of the film is equally as stunning as the film story and makes it astounding strong in all respects. Add to that the perfect melding of countless comics and portrayals in the performances here and the film falls into place as the pinnacle the Batman film series has to offer to date.",10,8,17,18 July 2008
The Fountain," A visual wonder.
","Darren Aronofsky's film is a visual wonder which much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey leaves you to come to your own conclusions. Hugh Jackman stars as Tom, one man who basically has the same desire across the three periods that the film covers in the film. Rachel Weisz is his lover across all these. The focal point is the middle point which appears to be the reality.The film opens with Tom as a Conquistador preparing for one last battle to get to the Tree of Life at the top of a Mayan Temple. His men abandon him at the last moment when they are ambushed by the Mayans guarding the temple. They are cut down by spears. Tom alone brazenly attacks the Mayans putting up a good fight before being cut down. But he is not killed. They force him to go up the steps of the temple to face their 'priest.' He slowly approaches the 'priest' with a dagger that wasn't stripped from him in the struggle below. It doesn't help him as is stabbed in the stomach and falls to his knees. The film cuts from there as 'priest' appears to cut him down with a blazing sword. Tom is now in space, in a bubble, flying through the stars. In the bubble is what appears to be the Tree of Life. He appears to meditating above it, floating. He cares for it and talks to it as if it were a living being, a close companion. He sees what appears to be a vision of Izzi, telling him to finish it. It is here that we cut to what appears to me to be the key point. We jump to the middle point which is modern times, or close to it. Tom is working at a desk and telling Izzi he is working on it. She leaves and just as Tom is going after her, he is called by a lab assistant to work on the patient. It is then revealed that he working on a cure for cancer, experimenting with monkeys. He is working vigorously on this because his wife, Izzi, has cancer and he refuses to lose her. 'Death is a disease. There is a cure. And I will find it.' This Tom declares.Hugh Jackman offers an amazing performance as Conquistador, doctor, and monk/spaceman in this film which spans centuries, but we are never really sure what is real. I could feel his characters anguish and frustration at not being able to help his wife and his growing obsession with finding the cure to death. Now I am not really sure who everything in the story connected, but I felt the growing point was about our inability to avoid death and that the greatest thing we can have on this earth at least according to this film is love. It is powerfully displayed visually in this film. It is a hard film to describe, but very much worth a viewing on the big screen. The score by Clint Mansell is incredible. The most memorable I have heard all year and the most beautiful. It captures the journey feel of the film.The film is very much a heavy film if you were for its message and visual experience. It isn't a clear cut adventure film, but one which forces you to think. Based around the Biblical Tree of Life described in Genesis, I think it is one of the most original pieces of artistry I have seen in quite sometime, but definitely not for those looking for pure entertainment.",8,0,1,22 January 2007
There Will Be Blood," An Angry Film With Strength
","'Are you an angry man, Henry?...Are you envious? Do you get envious?...I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most peopleThere are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking. I want to earn enough money that I can get away from everyoneI see the worst in people. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I want to rule and never, ever explain myself. I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little, Henry... to have you here gives me a second breath. I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people.' The film is a saga of just this, a man attempting to get away from it all. It is dark and bloody brilliant for it. I had my doubts early in the film when the sound appeared off from film rising to a finale that was not there. Actually, it was more foreboding than off, but it felt different. Nevertheless, it kept that throughout driving a deliberate pace, which built and built throughout making many expected and many non-expected turns and twists. I have never seen a Paul Thomas Anderson film until now, but this film is a great masterpiece to add to the films already out falling in line with No Country for Old Men and Zodiac for dark themes and moods.The first and strongest aspect of the film is the central performer, Daniel Day Lewis who plays a charismatic 'oil' man named Daniel Plainview. He speaks those words at the top in confidence to his brother, Henry. He believes his jealously and beliefs are ingrained in his whole family and, therefore, must reside in his brother as well. Well things in that respect are flawed, but it just goes further to prove Daniel's angry man complex. He can never truly be at peace. In addition, he finds a perfect enemy in the town 'minister' Eli Sunday, played with fervor by Paul Dano, who is made of the same stuff. Into this mix is added the beloved 'son' of Daniel, H W, who appears to be innocent, but cannot be truly, so with such a mentor/father as Daniel who will do whatever it takes to succeed to get away from everyone.These are just the keys players, the films is further helped by a brilliant symphonic soundtrack constructed by Johnny Greenwood, which invokes classical pieces, as well as, more 'primitive' sounds. I use primitive to refer to the native sound of it all, almost what could be called, a minimal sounding chorus at times with a single drum or strain carrying in the background. I think it helps to reach the savageness of the main characters and their ever growing jealously and anger.It is hard to talk about the film without revealing twists, which help to add to the greatness of the film, but I will leave it at that to suffice to say that this is great addition to the strong group of masterpieces that I have watched this past year.",9,4,10,23 January 2008
American Gangster," It Delivers The Goods, But Watch Out For Confusing Middle Section
","Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts may not appear to be so, but they are flip-sides of a coin. Frank Lucas starts off as a little time bosses' apprentice while Richie Roberts starts off as a regular undercover cop attempting to climb into a better calling. Each have a choice for which direction they want to live their lives and each choose almost polar opposite directions. Frank Lucas becomes the most feared gangster in America by selling drugs to his own people and trampling all the opposition while Richie Roberts takes the justice side of becoming the most hated police officer in the force because he does the right thing and doesn't cheat under the table. It is a fabulous tale of how their paths cross as one must take down the other to achieve his goal and in the process perhaps let another achieve his forgot dream as well.I don't want to reveal much more, but I will say this Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe nail their roles. One maybe flashier than the other, but I consider both just as great. There are a multitude of great supporting players here as well from Josh Brolin to Chiwetel Ejiofor. I think this reflects well upon the director Ridley Scott as he gets sort of Godfather effect from this crew.The film itself is edgy chalk full of violence from beginning to the volatile ending which has a great amount of twists. It begins with the burning a man and ends with burning of ones past in a new world. Beautiful circle screenplay here, but it is not without its problems as the middle section exemplifies with a confusing editing job about the chronological path of the film. That is about my biggest complaint of this film which is quite long with a running time of nearly 3 hours.It will satisfy fans of the trailer with its style and satisfy the critics with its structure and underlining story, but this film could have used a bit of trimming to save a bit of the confusion. Otherwise, I have no problem with this film following in The Departed footsteps.",7,0,6,2 November 2007
Jaws," Arguably Spielberg's Best Film
","Arguably Spielberg's best film. Peter Benchley's bubblegum story makes a perfect film. A shark stakes out Amity Island as its feeding grounds and is practically served up a smorgasborg as the town's people don't want to compromise their business to get this killing machine.Spielberg may not have meant to make this film so suspenseful, by not showing the audience the shark until midway through, but it works perfectly for this film. John William's score does an excellent job of adding to that suspense or maybe the score makes the suspense whatever the case it works perfectly.The greatest feature of this film is the great acting and chemistry between the leads, Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper), Roy Schneider (Chief Brody), and Robert Shaw (Quint). The constant bickering between them when they are cooped up on that boat together is great. The shark scenes are certainly great, but the complementary of this great cast is the factor that makes this film so excellent.",10,1,3,22 November 2007
WALL·E," Great Love Story Disappointing Side Story
","Usually Pixar wow's me with its story as well as it characters, but the latest tale from the people at Pixar has been a major disappointment in the story department. It is a run of the mill love story with a dystopia setting where man has been driven off earth because they trashed it. A very environmentalist viewpoint which is disappointingly simple for Pixar and in the class of Happy Feet as far as I am concerned with is a death knell normally for me, but it rises above the previous films problems by having a keenly interesting and investing main character in Wall-E. It is the love story that makes this film tick.The ads focused on Wall-E and hyped the film in that respect the film flourishes. Wall-E is given great meticulous character and detail by the artists. He is the most lovable of all the characters because he is unpolished and has the most nuisances of any character in the film be it human or robotic. He gained his character from being stuck on earth on eternal cleanup. Having only one single companion, an interestingly lovable cockroach, yeah that is a feat unto itself. He cherishes this companionship, but still yearns for something closer and more relatable for himself as he watched Hello Dolly to death. It is the opening exposition about Wall-E that gives the film solid momentum to get through the rest of the rough story as Eva comes down to search for life on the earth, which Wall-E has previously discovered. Her directive takes over from there and then it is simple struggle between machine and character, which is disappointingly uninteresting in itself, but for Wall-E and his determination of pleasing and loving Eva, the film would be a failure.Eva herself is almost the anti-thesis of Wall-E a pristine new robot with nary a scratch or piece of dust on her design. She is slowly but surely broken down by Wall-E's careful persistence. The love story is beautiful between the robots and surprisingly well design as opposed to the rest of the story with the obese humans and their regimented and sheltered life on an eternal cruise. That part of the story is shockingly overt which Pixar is usually good at avoiding.The film is great in its references to classic pop culture references with its films and songs. For that and Wall-E and his love story the film flourishes and is one of the best I have seen, but the side story involving the humans and the restart on earth or disappointing simple and blatant. Thus this latest venture from the people at Pixar specifically director Andrew Stanton and co-writer Pete Docter is a mixed bag.",7,3,11,27 June 2008
Paths of Glory," Despite 51 Years This Film Stills Holds Up
","War films are a Hollywood staple starting somewhere back when All Quiet on the Western front gained prominence for being a great adaptation of the famed novel by Erich Maria Remarque. This 1957 film continued that great tradition with another look at the insanity aroused by war. In this instance it explores the insanity that can be aroused within an armies own ranks and the blind obsessions and principles of some individuals. Kubrick is never one for pulling punches in his films and with a classic star at his disposal in Kirk Douglas; he goes for the jugular of the issue. The humanity of the issue and corruptness, but the great aspect of the film is that it never loses site of the fact that everyone can make mistakes and that humanity of everyone in the army is necessary.The backdrop of this film is based in fact. A certain General George Broulard, played with his usual air by Adolphe Menjou, comes to another commanding officer whom he manipulates into ordering a suicide run on the enemies' position. General Paul Mireau, played with a particularly hateful attitude by George Macready, then carries down the orders to his brilliant Colonel Dax, Kirk Douglas. Mireau in turns forces Dax to ready his men for the insane attack run. This is the setting, what follows of course is the utter failure of the attack and the anger of the superiors especially Mireau. Mireau wants to kill some hundred troops as an example of the men's cowardice, because during the attack he sees about roughly half of Dax's troops refusing to advance out of the trenches.The film's strength is not in the message so much as the human face Kubrick gives the soldiers zeroing first on a moment of true cowardice committed by Lieutenant Roget. The Lieutenant is ordered to go on a reconnaissance mission the night before the attack by Dax, and, whether out of fear of going into No Man's Land or just a bad drinking problem, he gets drunk before going out with two of his men. As the trio goes out, he makes rash decisions, splitting up the party and fleeing at the first signs of trouble in the process letting fly a grenade that kills one of his men. The other man on the mission stays behind to see this and makes it back alive. This seemingly smaller story inside the big story is key though I think because it shows the humanity of the issue. What gives the commanding General up in his safe booth the authority to call his men cowards? He cannot possibly have a feel for the issues of the moment as Colonel Dax does in seeing his men bottled up in the trenches because they will be slaughtered upon going over the top.The last third of the film is devoted to the court-martial of three of Dax's men over the issue of cowardice because Dax has managed through his form weight of being a premier lawyer to get the Generals to agree to settle for just three men's life at steak instead of the hundred originally discussed to show an example. The three men in question are either chosen by the commanding officers by random of because they are generally in disfavor as is Corporal Philippe Paris, the man who witnessed Roget's cowardice. Each falls apart as the date of their never in question execution approaches.I will not reveal much more about the plot and the ending, but I will say that this film stands as a stellar war film dealing with great issues of warfare and the horrors it creates. The performances are gripping and the story gives a fair tone to the whole issue although as is usual of a Kubrick film the protagonist is generally in opposition to the authority throughout the film a effort that Kirk Douglas does with his usual ferocity, nobody can quite getting as seemingly hot tempered as Douglas. He is a yeller of extraordinary talent. Despite being roughly 51 years old this film still holds up quite well with great cinematography work and art direction.",10,5,9,2 May 2008
Iron Man," Great Kick Off to the Summer Lineup
","Playboy rich superheroes are in, officially. First the Dark Knight makes a splash with Batman Begins taking superheroes dark and non-super dare I venture and now we have Marvel's version which is much splashier and glamorous. Tony Stark is Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. is both with ease and flare.The updating of the character for Iron Man comic enthusiasts works quite well as it keeps the original gray, large, and bulky design. As well, the filmmakers threw in as much of the Marvel lore of the character as they could from SHIELD to Jarvis, not the butler but a slight variation given flare by the voice of the wonderful Paul Bettany. For those interested in more nods check out the final scene at the end of the credits.Robert Downey Jr. is the king of the show though despite the ultra-cool and slick looking Iron Man suit and all the effects around it. He grabs hold of the spoiled rich boy persona and exudes confidence and silver tongue as the CEO of Stark Enterprises. He is a genius as well as a patriot of sorts or rather he becomes a patriot through the events of the film. His character's complexity is in the fact that despite his well-meaning attitude, the attitude, which comes across to the public, is kind one of an attention-seeking star. It is an allure of the character, but also a defect as it is hard to believe he is doing this for selfless reasons. Downey portrays all this quite well making for a well-rounded blockbuster central character.A strong group of characters and actors surrounds Tony Stark / Robert Downey Jr. One of the top amongst them being his secretary Mrs. Pepper Potts played with charm and some sass by Gwyneth Paltrow. She is obviously the heart of Stark, his closest link to humanity up on his pedestal. Along with Potts are Jim Rhodes, and Obadiah Stane, of business relation and the only other human strings Stark has, a family of sorts for the young genius. Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges play each respective character and offer the friendship side of Stark.Spoiler Alert Along with being, the father figure of sorts Obadiah Stane gets to play a more complex angle. He gets to play the close to the heart villain much as Ducard was in Batman Begins. He doubles to fill to voids and does so quite adequately if a bit heavy handily. The Iraq War is a dated but timely affair to trace the hero to, but it works. The villain of course is one dimensional, but that is all right for an escape film like this with far bigger than life characters.In all the film is great kick off to the summer lineup and the best Marvel has to offer since Spider-Man 2 in 2004. The effects are pristine and the action raw and fun as well the humor is generally on target. It is safe to say this is the best fun I have had in the theater all year.",8,1,3,1 May 2008
Tombstone," Kilmer's Show
","No question I think this is easily Val Kilmer's best role to date. He has all the best lines, the best swagger, and steals every scene he can get his mug in. It's a shame he wasn't nominated the year this came out, but then again some say the western has been dead for years. I beg to differ although this one does go on a bit too long and has a bit of an awkward romance between Wyatt Earp and Josephine. But I will have to say the fantastic cast makes up quite a bit and Kilmer commands it in the right direction along with Russell who through his weight around as the lead. Best line: 'I'm your huckleberry...' or 'You're a daisy if you do!' Hard to call so many great one liners from Doc Holiday Kilmer.",8,0,0,7 November 2007
Atonement," Beautifully Sad
","Joe Wright has master eye for the camera. He seems to like to tell the story by having characters in the most beautiful settings he can imagine or create. Atonement is no different and, in fact, I might say a trifle more beautiful and much sadder than his previous work in Pride & Prejudice. While not among my top tier film masterpieces of the year this comes quite close with its great story design and strong performances. And in a year full of sad films it does not quite the punch of the films with the message, but rather just sticks to the tale and tells is exquisitely. This is a tale of misunderstanding and of course, atonement.The tale begins of a little girl, Briony, played fantastically by Saoirse Ronan, who is typing a play up and is quite excited about it. Things do not go so well though when she wants to see the play done. Circumstances are bad for the visiting children and she has to make sacrifices, but then she gets a doozy of an idea when she misconstrues a situation from a far of her sister and the gardener. More errors are made on both sides further along as she jumps to conclusions with a creative mind, the gardener writes and sends the wrong letter, and of course, Briony can resist a read when she is entrusted with it. The sins and misinterpretations of one day and one night have devastating repercussions with jail being the least of worries when war comes.I will point out one of my few quirks about the situation here. I do not get why the pair did not just talk over the situation with Briony when she saw them in the library. It just made it that much more muddled. Sure Briony did the telling and jumped to the conclusion, but they offered her no explanation and she was young impressionable and the other cousin agreed to the lie.Well anyways, besides my reservations about how the situation arose and where the blame was cast, I became enthralled in how Wright broached the war and the incredible makeup that was used in the hospital scenes. That was quite a spectacle and made one shudder a bit without being harsh. He did much the same with the Dunkirk sequence, which was disgusting in the horror of the situation and beautiful with how the camera moved across it all. For a guy who I heard does not like period pieces, Wright is a natural nay a master at it.",9,4,6,26 January 2008
