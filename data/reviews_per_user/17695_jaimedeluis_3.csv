Scarface," Short review about my thoughts of 'Scarface'
","Personally, I expected more about this film. Great plot, good argument, one of the best directors... but there is something that sends this all to the ground. Maybe it's the length of the film. Maybe it's the flat action, or maybe it's Al Pacino's madness that leads to an implausible final, where a complete unknown character seems to be the star of the film by shooting Montana. And I didn't liked the time lapses: 1 month, 3 months, 3 years... Hopefully the film ended before we had to wait 2 generations till we enter the action. I have to say that visual effects of the actors when getting shoot were really crafted. And that Brian DePalma is one of my favorite directors, but this film isn't what I thought.",5,0,0,11 October 2017
12 Angry Men," But why not?
","This film is a must see. One friend once said 'you haven't seen real cinema till you watch this film'. Now I have to thank him because he was right. How to keep someone during 90 minutes in front of the TV without moving? You can tie him to the sofa, or you can put '12 angry men' on the screen. This film is the perfect example of how sometimes greats dialogues and better facial expressions can give much more than other kinds of action. This film is 90 minutes of how the character incredibly well performed by Henry Fonda could not just change the whole jury's mind, but also spectators'. So, my question: why did not this film won the Oscar award?",10,0,0,11 October 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," THIS IS WHERE THE FUN BEGINS
","Personally, I do not understand all that hatred. Many of us (including myself) do not understand Luke's 'cowardice' at the beginning of the movie.Okey. But from there to demand its elimination from the canon ... Luke dies. At some point he was going to do it, or did they want him to die at the hands of the main enemy, like Obi Wan? Snoke is just a secondary character, or did they want to repeat the figure of the Emperor? Rey's parents are (in principle) scrap dealers, or did they want her to be Luke's daughter, or Obi Wan's granddaughter, or Yoda's niece, or what? Or did they prefer that Snoke had appeared and cut off Rey's hand, saying 'I am your father'? Would you prefer to constantly repeat the original trilogy? The characters are not going to be eternal, or would you prefer them to die in the explosion of a ship or while destroying the new base of the enemy, as in the Return of the Jedi? If you want a reboot, better go see the original trilogy. The best trilogy that there will ever be of Star Wars, but accept this new one that comes, and that tries to create a new story, not to repeat an already written one, however much you like it. My congratulations to Rian Johnson.",8,1,3,23 December 2017
