The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," If we burn, you burn with us!
","I'm a big hunger games fan,Mockingjay however was my least favourite book of the series. I'm not going to get into why as this is a movie review. I am going to try and review the movie based on the movie.I was skeptical when I heard they were splitting this there is not a lot to work with here,I think splitting Catching Fire would have made more sense. The only movie I agreed with splitting was Harry Potter. It made sense. I was pleasantry surprised and quite enjoyed this movie.The acting was amazing. Jennifer Lawrence was great as always. She really brings warmth to Katniss that I think many others would have a hard time with. Josh Hutcherson is great in the little time he gets. Philip Seymour Hoffman really shows how great of an actor he was,and what a loss he is to the acting world. Julianne Moore did a wonderful job,her performance as Coin gives you the unsettling feeling about Coin. Sam Claflin was good in the limited role but he did shine when he was on. Elizabeth Banks though blew me away. She really showed a whole new side to Effie. It was very layered and you can feel that she is putting up this act to hide how scared she is.The shaky cam is back and I was not happy about that. It drives me up the wall. Jennifer Lawrence also sang 'The Hanging Tree' it was a beautiful version and well done. The ending is one you will either love or hate.I think if you have read the book,you'll enjoy it as you know what is to come but if you have not you might have some issues with it. Although I think in a year when you see the second part you might like it more. That being said you should be able to watch a movie without reading the books.",8,17,48,20 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Feel, don't think. Trust your instincts.
","And my instincts say this movie sucks. It's not even that the storyline is one no one cares about (which it is) or that the acting is wooden (which it is) it's biggest sin is that's it's just boring. I can get enjoyment out of a bad movie,nothing funnier then a movie that is so bad it's good but unfortunately in this case it's not so bad it's good/funny,it's just bad. This is not the Star Wars I know and love. I'm not claiming that the original trilogy is one of the best movies ever made,I love them and they're tons of fun but they don't touch movies likes Lord Of The Rings but I enjoy them so much. TPM is not fun or enjoyable. If you started watching Star Wars with this movie,I would not blame you for giving up.",4,3,6,19 August 2014
The Maze Runner," If you ain't scaredÂ… you ain't human.
","I have not read this book so this is totally based on the movie. I quite like dtytopian movies however this one was quite disappointing. I never really cared about the characters or felt a connection to them. The 'reveal' was lame. The acting was pretty good though. It's not horrible it's just not very good.Some of the fight scenes needed some editing,it was all over the place. You had no idea what was going on!I felt like they showed us too much too soon,I would have liked to have some of the info later in the film,kind of took some of the mystery away. The maze scenes were exciting though,I'll give them that.",5,0,1,21 September 2014
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," magical and full of wonder.
","I recently re-watched this movie after seeing it quite a few years ago. I forgot how wonderful this movie is. It feels so magical and full of wonder. You feel so immersed in this world. It flows nicely and does not feel overlong. There are some scenes especially at the beginning of the movie where some bombing happens which might be scary for younger children. Aslan making the ultimate sacrifice always chokes me up. This is such a wonderful film about forgiveness. The bond of the siblings is wonderfully portrayed,while they do get into fights and sometimes do things that can hurt others you can see that is nothing that they would not do for each other.",9,0,0,25 June 2014
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Together again, huh?
","The Return of the Jedi,while not as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back is still a pretty solid film. There are a few silly/cheesy things like the ewoks capturing Han and Luke. However the story is good,the acting is good and it's an enjoyable movie to watch. The rescue of Han is really good and exciting to watch. The Ewoks themselves don't bug me as much as some,they were a little overused but I'd still take them over Jar-Jar anyday. The ending just makes me happy and puts a smile on my face,our heroes after all they have been through are safe,alive and happy. Seeing them all progress through the 3 films is a wonderful experience.",8,0,1,30 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This is such a drag.
","Attack of the Clones while being better then TPM still has some issues. There is some pretty good stuff though. the lightsaber duels are awesome,Obi-Wan is awesome,the score is great and the story is pretty interesting. A big part of the problem with this movie is Anakin ,everytime he is on screen I get angry. He's so bratty and whiny. 'Obi-Wan won't let me do this' 'He's jealous of me' it goes on and on. If George Lucas was trying to make us feel sympathy with Anakin he failed miserably. While Luke may have been a bit whiny too he was never that bad. The end of the movie gets you all pumped up for the clone wars;which you don't get to see. Don't get me started on Anakin and Padme,they have next to no chemistry and I frankly could care less if they got together. They are no Han and Leia that's for sure.They should have taken a few notes from them before writing for Anakin and Padme.",5,1,4,20 August 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," funny,sad and sweet
","I quite liked this movie. The acting was great. It was funny,sad and sweet all in one. I loved that all the characters felt very real. The movie can be very tense at times.Hazel and Gus are a very believable couple and they do not just hop into bed either,it takes awhile for them to get there. One of the best parts of the movie though was the portrayal of Hazel's parents. They were loving and supportive,one of the best parents I have seen in a movie! In fact the only fight they really have is because Hazel (as a only child) is worried what will happen when they she dies and they no longer have a child to look after.This is a beautiful film and life and love.",7,0,1,25 June 2014
Frozen," Awesome Movie,Amazing Songs
","Frozen is a wonderful movie,it really has it all. The music is amazing. Best music from Disney since The Lion King.Frozen has all the best things about Disney movies but with one great twist. the love story is about Elsa and Anna and the bond of sisters. No matter how much Elsa pushes Anna away Anna never gives up. This is based on The Snow Queen but only very loosely. There are a few jokes that older teens and adults will get but will go over the heads of younger ones.At the core of Frozen is love in all it's forms but especially the love of family. It also celebrates being true to yourself and being yourself. I also think it shows that romantic love takes awhile as Anna and Kristoff don't kiss until the very end of the movie.",7,2,5,3 July 2014
Big Hero 6," I am satisfied with my care.
","My Dad and I see lots of movies together,but rare is it that my Dad will go on and on about a movie but that is what he did for this movie. Disney has really been hitting it out of the park lately. As both a Marvel and Disney fan this movie appealed to both sides. Unlike superhero movies like the Avengers,this is a movie you can take younger ones to.San Fransokyo really blended the two cities well. I would love to see Disney do something with that in the parks. All the characters were wonderful;smart,funny and loyal. The cast was diverse but it was a cast that happened to be diverse instead of a diverse cast. That's when you know you've hit diversity when it's just a part of the who the characters are not the main part. The villain was nothing special but that's a very minor complaint of an otherwise amazing movie. What Frozen did for sisters, Big Hero 6 does for brothers. You can really see how much they love each other and Hiro's brother is always looking out for him and is a great example to Hiro. Hiro's grief is not a blink and miss it is with him throughout the movie. He learns to get support from his friends and that his brother will always be with him.",9,19,43,10 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," a thief, two thugs, an assassin and a maniac
","This movie blew me away. I was excited for it already but hearing all the good things about it in the weeks leading up to it had me counting down the days. It did not disappoint. It was funny,it was serious,it was campy but most of all it was just fun. I can't remember the last time I had such a good time at the movie theater. If you like Firefly,Star Wars or Star Trek you should enjoy it. Chris Pratt was awesome as Peter Quill. Rocket was a nice surprise,Groot also was wonderful. Gamora was wonderful too.At no point in the movie was I bored. It was great to get some Thanos screen time.Many people were saying this movie was a big risk and well this 'risk' sure won. The MCU has well made movies end of story.",9,0,3,4 August 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," You didn't see that coming?
","***** this review contains lots of spoilers read at your own risk***I've seen avengers twice now and waited awhile to write this so I've really soaked it in. While I did enjoy it,and maybe the hype is to blame but I was a bit disappointed. It's a great movie,just not quite what I was expecting. I will say I enjoyed it much more on the 2nd viewing.I was really disappointed with killing Quicksilver off and while I don't think he will stay dead,I feel that there were characters that would have had more of an emotional impact,plus I really enjoyed the twins and wanted to see both of them becoming avengers.Clint being married felt out of a left field.The Bruce/Natasha thing felt really forced and awkward. If they had some buildup it would have been different but the way it was handled was badly written.There was next to no Steve/Natasha friendship,I loved how they became friends in TWS and yet we barley see it here.Some things felt really rushed,Thor going and discovering about the gems,it was blink and you miss it. If you know nothing about the infinity stones I would not blame you if you were totally confused.I really wish there had been more Rodeny and Falcon.There were lots of things I enjoyed too.I loved the setup for Civil War. Scarlet Witch was awesome. When Vision actually lifted MjÃ¶lnir. My theater clapped. Really getting to know Clint. The tech guy from TWS who almost got shot was in it,which was a neat little nod.Vision was awesome,I thought he looked great too. I very much enjoyed him.James Spader did a great job as Ultron,I loved how he was a bit funny and sarcastic.I did find Ultron going from confused 'what am I?' to 'need to destroy the world' a bit quick. That being said I read that the original cut was over 3 hours so maybe some things got cut between that. Can't wait to see the deleted scenes. I hope there are more stuff with the twins.My favourite part was the party especially with trying to lift MjÃ¶lnir. Gotta give huge props to Chris Hemsworth on his face when Steve moves it a little. He looks so worried and tries to look like he was not worried lol.It's nowhere as good as the first avengers,guardians of the galaxy or the winter solider but it's a pretty solid film and worth the price to go see it.",8,1,4,7 May 2015
Downfall," well acted but hard to watch
","Downfall is very well acted but hard to watch. It could have been trimmed down by 10 minutes or so. Since its focus on a lot of the high ranking nazi's there is no real sympathy for anybody expect a few of the young kids and the dog! It is a disturbing film to see all these people blindly following Hitler. Bruno Ganz really impressed me as Hitler,he did an amazing job. It really felt like watching the real Hitler. Juliane KÃ¶hler was wonderful as Eva as well. It is quite a violent movie but I think in a movie like this it's needed. The scene where the children were poisoned was very hard to watch,especially as the oldest seemed to know what her mother was giving her. I do think having some prior knowledge of the last days of world war 2 and who the high ranking nazi are and what they did helps.",7,0,3,25 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Will you follow me, one last time?
","The third Hobbit movie is upon us,the last middle earth movie for quite a while. I was skeptical when I heard they were splitting The Hobbit in 3 and I still feel 2 would have been enough. Are the hobbit movies a tad long? Yes. Are they as good as The Lord Of The Rings? No way. Is there some nostalgia going on in the Hobbit that makes me enjoy it? Sure. Nonetheless I really liked this movie. It was an enjoyable time. It felt like coming home. I did have some unanswered questions but hopefully those will be answered on the extended edition. Martin Freeman is really the perfect Bilbo,he captures him perfectly. Watching all 6 movies together will a wonderful experience. It will bring everything home.I did feel Bilbo was kinda pushed to the side when it's supposed to be 'The Hobbit'. The final scene was just perfect and brought tears to my eyes.",9,2,6,21 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," May the force be with us all.
",This is the only film in the prequel that I really enjoy. It's not perfect by any means (but what film is?) but I'm not bored like in episode 1 or annoyed like in episode 2. There is lots of good! Obi-Wan is really awesome and Ewan McGregor really shows how great he is. You can actually feel the bond of Obi-Wan and Anakin and the heartbreak of Obi-Wan. The duel on Mustafar is really cool. Seeing Darth Vader at the end is exciting. Man I don't really cry at movies but I do chock up at order 66 getting carried out. Padme dying because she 'lost the will to live' is kinda lame and some of Padme and Anakin's lines together are cringeworthy;something I would expect from a 14 year old. Overall though those are very minor things and don't really bring the movie enjoyment level down. So while I don't like this as much as the Original trilogy it's a solid film and one I actually look forward to watching.,7,0,1,21 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Chewie, we're home.
","Oh are we ever. I loved this movie,Star Wars feels like Star Wars again. some may say that this is a rehash of A New Hope and there are some,but I don't think it's overdone. The new characters are all great and you care about them. Daisy Ridley was really great but the standout to me was Adam Driver,wow. He played Kylo Ren perfectly,he showed his evil side,his battle with the light side,his anger and his conflict. Driver really nailed it,especially in his scene with Han Solo. Best scene in the movie.John Williams does it again with his music,what a beautiful score.The movie had it's funny moments in all the right places and was dark when it needed to. I really loved Poe and Finn's friendship and hope to see more in episode 8 and more of Poe in general. He was underused. BB8 was very cute and funny,I want my own! It was not perfect however,I would have liked to see more Poe,see Luke,Leia and Han together again. More backstory on why Kylo has so much hate towards Han;I guess we'll probably get more backstory to that in the next episode but would have liked it in here,would have made the Han/Kylo scene all that more powerful.Overall it was very enjoyable and one I will be seeing many times in the theatre.May the Force be with you.",9,3,17,18 December 2015
Unbroken," A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain
","Unroken is a good film,but that's the problem it's merely a good film,that's it. While some films stay with you and you want to discuss them after that is not the case with this movie. On one hand this movie feels bloated and felt that the drifting at sea could have been trimmed way down on the other hand,I wish they had some scenes dealing with his PTSD and forgiving his captors. The story itself is so inspiring,I can't help but wonder how they could make s movie that is so safe and textbook. Jack O'Connell is a wonderful actor though,I see a bright future ahead for him. It does have some good themes about honour, and determination.",6,1,7,26 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Force is strong with this one.
","A New Hope is a great movie,it's lots of fun but has interesting characters too. Han,Luke and Leia all have great chemistry together. Alec Guinness is wonderful as Obi-Wan. Watching this right after The Revenge Of The Sith really brought his performance to a new level. You can see all that pain he had is still there after 20 years. Han and Leia have a wonderful banter,it's hard not to fall for them right away. I do find the part with R2D2 and C3PO a bit tedious but other then that it's very well paced. The music is amazing and is so memorable. I'm not old enough to have seen this in theatres but I remember watching this on VHS many times. I loved Princess Leia and wanted to be just like her. Even watching this movie years later I still do! You really fall in love with these characters,even ones like Chewbacca,R2D2 and C3PO. The effects are still good today,some of it may look a little dated but none of it actually looks bad. This movie is a treat to watch.",9,0,2,22 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet.
","This is by far the best Star Wars movie. It's so enjoyable and every part of the movie is great. I do find that most 'middle' movies out of a trilogy are the best as you don't have to introduce the main characters and you don't have to tie anything up.Han and Leia's romance is lots of fun;it's snarky and flirty and they have tons of chemistry. Darth Vader telling Luke he is his Father never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. You do see Luke becoming more mature in this movie,Mark Hamil did such a great job with him.Even after all these years the effects are still great,they don't look dated and never takes you away from the story. Something I think many filmmakers could use a lesson in,effects should be used to enhance a story,not be the base of the story. While the effects were cool,that's not what I remember about Star Wars. It's about the story and these characters. I truly believe that is why these movies are still so popular and will continue to be for many years to come.",10,1,2,28 August 2014
