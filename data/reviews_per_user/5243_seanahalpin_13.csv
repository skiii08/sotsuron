Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A ghastly unwatchable flop
","Like many others who thrilled to the original star wars films, I sat in the theatre at the beginning of Phantom Menace, my heart beating in excited anticipation as the familiar music filled my ears.... and then... and then... Jar Jar bloody Binks...What a bunch of crud! Darth Maul looks like a clown gone wrong. Jar Jar Binks is a moron. The pod race is exciting but out of place. Queen Amidala takes herself far too seriously. The spaceships don't look enough like the original star wars ships to hold my interest...To be fair, kids will probably like this one. But kids like anything that goes pop whistle bang. This was over hyped and I felt cheated watching this disneyfied version of star wars meets the teletubbies.Do yourself a favour. If you loved the original star wars films - you will HATE this one. Don't bother! It puts a bad taste in your mouth, and now I can't even watch the originals without thinking of that stupid Jar Jar Binks and his floppy ears and clumsy gait. Bah Humbug.",1,4,8,17 February 2002
Fight Club," Brilliant, brooding and engulfing
","When this movie was marketed in Australia, it looked like your typical punch up Brad Pitt prettyboy movie... Once again the movie marketing machine shot itself in the foot, by underestimating the intelligence and taste of the public.Fight Club is a spiral into darkness. Exactly what darkness this is, is never quite explained. Madness? Reality? Violence? Fantasy? The acting is dynamic, the tension builds exquisitely, and the whole movie is both thought provoking and shocking.Congratulations to Brad Pitt for his work in this film, which was under-appreciated by the mainstream, mainly due to sloppy marketing.
********************SPOILER ALERT**************************After seeing the movie, I am still trying to work out if Marla was real or not. I come up on the side of not real, but would like to know what others thought.",10,0,1,19 February 2002
The Others," Chilling little ghost story
","I guess the people watching this film fall into two categories - the ones who have a real shock from the twist in the end; and the ones (like me) who cottoned on almost from the beginning.Yes there is a twist, but I think it is the eerie cinematography, the strong acting (yes, even of Nicole Kidman...) and the gothic style setting that makes this beautiful, sad, frightening tale so mind-capturing.This movie is a ghost story in the old style - where there is no 'blood and guts' but rather a sick, tight feeling at a strange noise in the middle of the night...",9,0,0,26 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Rude comment below
","Loved this movie, saw it as a kid. But did anyone else notice that the crustacean looking alien rebel goodie in the final space fight scenes(was it Admiral Ackbar??) had a mouth that looked very similar to the female genitalia????Hhmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.",9,0,0,18 February 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Binks in the Background makes SW2 a winner
","Firstly, may I say (perhaps somewhat cynically) that obviously George Lucas has done some market research after the floppery that was Star Wars I - and in his next instalment has given audiences what they were really after. Yes, gone (for the most part) are Jar Jar Binks and the muffin-head kid playing Anakin Skywalker. Instead, we have a cast worthy for a prelude to the original Star Wars movies.The mistake of the first Star Wars was to pander to the Disney market, resulting in an immature film insulting to the intelligence of the majority of its audience. Yeah yeah, I know - science fiction is for kids. But its also for grown up kids. We don't need Jar Jar Binks to be entertained... and yes, Star Wars 2 is a winner.Here we see the real foreshadowings of things to come. There are action scenes, brilliant effects, a minimum of puppetry although a tad too much soppy romance with the unlikeable Anakin and the hot to trot Padme.Key scenes to look out for: the Padwan (trainee Jedi) class; Obi Wan Kenobi's visit to see the clone army (our first real sighting of Bobba Fett; plus more! Yes, there are still some corny elements - but hey, it wouldn't be Star Wars without them. Well done George and Lucasfilm. Now if we can just finish off Jar Jar once and for all in SW3...",9,0,0,26 May 2002
Forrest Gump," A study in Ho-Hum ness
","Typical Tom Hanks vehicle that should never have rolled out of the garage. A mixture of yokel and idiot savant, Hanks is as bland as ever in this role. Gurk gurk gurk. The best parts of this film are the supporting actors. Hanks should go back to his bachelor party.Life is like a box of chocolates, and these ones have gone off...",1,14,34,17 February 2002
Face_Off," A steaming pile of crapola
","Yet again, Hollywood has too much money to even consider making a worthwhile film. Instead, they trot out this pile of manure for the willing consumption of the tasteless masses.Don't get me wrong, I like a good action movie. But this isn't one.I couldn't get past the woeful acting, the thin plot, the ridiculous, hammy 'climax'.***SPOILER***Oh please, so what if they had their faces swapped. What about their bodies? Nicolas Cage was in shape; John Travolta looked like he'd chugged a few too many cheeseburgers a la Pulp Fiction. Couldn't Travolta's wife tell the difference? I hope to god my wife would be able to tell *my* Mr Happy from that of some crim who's had my face sewn on.And all that rushing around on jet boats with bangs and whistles and hoo har. Oh please. One punch in the chops would be enough to knock a guy out... let alone knock his newly sewn on face off. And we are meant to believe that this was all really happening???I sat there laughing at the wrong places. I was thinking, F*ck Off / Face Off. But surprisingly some of my friends actually liked it.1 out of 10.",1,39,65,18 February 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Ho Hum
","First, let me say that I am Australian, love Australian movies, and admire the daring, new and exciting.Moulin Rouge delivers on some levels: The costuming is sumptuous There are witty gags through the music (especially loved the Like a Virgin scene) The acting is generally quite good Nicole Kidman is perfect for the role (I usually am not a fan of Nicole...)BUTI thought that the avant garde film making was hampered by a thin plot and weak dialogue. Come on, people, any film with the line, 'You MUST sleep with the Duke' lacks sophistication. The underlying love story, though sweet, was very run-of-the-mill and seemed to be incidental to the theatrics.Moulin Rouge has made a stir, but I suspect that it will become one of those films that people forget as newer and better films come along. To give it credit, it has broken new ground - but I thought Madonna and 'Evita' was more sophisticated.",4,0,1,18 February 2002
The Piano," Brilliant for thinking people
","This movie was so emotionally involving that I literally fainted in cinema during the climax and had to go again to see what happened.The psychology, rather than the action, is what is gripping. I felt that the most gripping theme of the movie was that of misunderstanding others, not 'love', or 'passion'.Every actor is brilliant, particularly Holly Hunter and Anna Paquin.Not everyone would like the film. Many people (and particularly men) would think, 'What was the point of all that?' Perhaps it is a 'chick flick'. Yet, if you are fascinated by the psychology of human relationships, this movie casts an eerie spell that remains with you long after seeing it.",10,1,5,17 February 2002
The Mummy Returns," The Mummy Returns... as a Dummy!
","I loved the Mummy. What a rollicking good yarn. Back to the 1980s Indiana Jones tongue in cheek rah rah britain archaeological adventures. Lots of freaky bugs to eat you from the inside out. etc etc etc.BUTThe Mummy Returns does not rollick. The yarn has unravelled. This movie makes you want to be sick from the inside out.Don't get me wrong. The movie starts VERY PROMISINGLY!!! I read somewhere that the Rock was anxious people would think he was a crap actor. It might come as good news to him that he was the best actor in the whole darn thing! The little muffin head kid was woeful and very un-cute. Brendan Fraser was looking a little tired, as though he didn't really care.All this I could have handled. That is, until the flying balloon ship.HELLO???? CRAP ALERT!!!! This crappy balloon flies into some jungle thing with pygmies running around. Uh-Duh? What??? True. Pygmies.This was one of those movies that started well, became mediocre, and then became very corny. I know, I know, what can I expect from a sequel. But I feel that the movie could have been very good... I want to know where I can get one of those balloon ships...",1,3,6,18 February 2002
Pulp Fiction," Gritty and absorbing
","I first saw this film on video knowing nothing about it other than it had been a blockbuster at the movies a year or two earlier. From the moment it came on, I was absolutely glued to the television.Stunning rather than enjoyable, it is a collection of images, characters and situations that (thank god) are far removed from the everyday life of the suburbanite. Humorous and horrific, it is hypnotic, and as the art critic viewing Kramer's portrait in Seinfeld exclaims, it is 'hideous! And yet I cannot look away!'Jackie Brown, another Tarantino film followed similar characters in a less violent way, and may be the better choice for those wanting less gore. Both films are excellent depictions of how the 'other side' live.(The only thing that I didn't like about the film was the Tarantino cameo. Why does he think that just because he is a brilliant film maker, he is also a brilliant actor? His scenes always seem too stilted for my liking).This film is a must-see for anyone who counts themselves as a genuine movie buff.",10,0,1,17 February 2002
Jackie Brown," A great Tarantino
","Jackie Brown is my favourite Tarantino film. Grier is absolutely brilliant in the lead role, showing that a middle aged black woman is able to pack one hell of a punch. She is sexy, manipulative and gives as good as she gets while maintaining her charisma throughout.The movie is not as violent or 'arty' as Pulp Fiction, but I feel that in some ways this allows a wider audience to appreciate what Tarantino has to offer. (Luckily, Tarantino does not make one of his frequent awkward cameos in this film). Lisa Gay Hamilton (aka Rebecca on TVs 'The Practice') makes a cameo as a young misled country girl.The plot is simple on the surface - but there are depths and unexpected twists all the way. Samuel L Jackson is always great value as a gun runner, truly cold hearted and yet likeable.This film was perhaps not marketed as well as it should have been, and is worth a look for those wanting a suspenseful thriller where characterisation is more important than explosions and special effects.",10,0,3,17 February 2002
The Breakfast Club," Group therapy for the young and pimply
","Go teenagers! Boo adults!This movie is great if you can hack the corny eightiesness that occasionally pops its head up. When I first saw it (in the eighties) I actually thought it would be cool to have group detention on a weekend. Now I have a laugh and think, 'god i took myself seriously then'. And that is what is great about the film. The issues may not seem deep to adults who have mortgages etc. But there is still something that teenagers (whether in the 80s, 90s or 00s) see of themselves in this movie, that have kept it as a cult classic.The Breakfast Club joins Grease and a few other late 70s/ early to mid 80s films that many of us in our 20s to 30s can quote line for line...",10,0,1,17 February 2002
