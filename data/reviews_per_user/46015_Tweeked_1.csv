Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As good as it gets (nearly!)
","Let me get one thing out of the way:  I did NOT wait in line to see this movie.  I was excited, yes, but not fanatic...It was with great relief that I found myself disagreeing with a large percentage of the critics after sitting through the opening day matinee with my wife.  For one thing, the movie passed the litmus test of inspiring my wife (who HATES sci-fi) to comment on the possibility of seeing it again as we left the theater.I DO agree with the critics on some of their points.  Is the character development on the weak side?  Sure.  Is the film fraught with special effects wizardry?  Yep.  Is Jar-Jar Binks annoying?  Can be.  Yet in spite of the shallowness alleged by so many, there is also a depth of intrigue and politics which are completely absent from the first three.  The original trilogy just asked you to 'feel.'  This one asks you to think as well.Unlike the 'professional' critics, I certainly would not tell you what your impressions of this movie should be.  I will say, however, that my wife and I enjoyed it tremendously.  In my opinion, there were a few moments of cheesiness, but they were easy for ME to overlook as inconsequential blemishes in the huge tapestry Lucas has woven for us.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
