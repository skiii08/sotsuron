Mission: Impossible III," Good movie but not too much MI.
","I think this was a pretty good movie after the last weak performance, what is actually amazing when you think John Woo was directing it. Nice directing it had but everything else was something like 'blow up the theater and audience to blind their eyes'.Comparing to first one, Brian De Palma directing, third one got lot closer to that like you probably guessed.My opinion is that M:I:III is not truly M:I at all. It's interesting, OK directing, OK acting.. but not M:I. Nice to watch, but sad there still isn't that original surprise feeling. I think same thing was with the first one, though better but He would never leave his men behind for money.The movie itself is good and interesting. For M:I fans it's like seeing to the future of Ethan Hunt. Nobody lives forever, right? Still I didn't quite get any character out of Mister Hunt, Tom Cruise -smile was there yes (god bless not more than that) but couldn't get any picture of it.Action, OK/good directing, basic plot or less, nice acting, enjoyable. Can't really say more of this. Didn't make me sick, worth of watching. 7/10. If you liked first one this is probably forth of spending time few hours.",7,0,0,22 May 2006
Skyfall," Terrific comeback
","I dunno if you guys get this one but comparing to M:I4 Ghost Protocol this was a masterpiece.Many similarities here and there but still surprisingly good. And really, back to the roots. Only few things made me little disappointed with this one was bond getting too erm. weird. It actually worked.Not too much explosions (well there are..) not too much cgi-crap etc. and it got cooler every minute.Really interesting bond for a long time. Actually needs brains a bit to watch this one, if you have seen them all I'll bet you get the idea with this one.This was a comeback, I waited something like explode everything, slow motion effects, stupid sequences but really really inspired with this one.One thing I don't get the hype of this movie, it stands on it's own greatly.For bond fans: 9/10",9,53,104,6 February 2013
Iron Man 3," Very enjoying stuff to watch, not too bright though
","Personally I didn't like any of Ironman movies much, first one was pretty interesting.Then there was second one that went beyond boundaries mixing all the stuff together so viewer couldn't understand at all. Great effects though.Then this third one, too much explosions and such boring stuff, too much ideas and all but still... Acting was very good, directing also, mostly I didn't like that it was two hours or something like that.Very nice ending for trilogy I think. Very much CGI and all but it kind of not bothered me. Well done, maybe little character stuff too much. But liked it somehow, few times I almost slept and there were issues which made movie more watchable.8/10 for great directing etc. Script didn't quite catch me.",8,2,4,22 June 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Back to childhood whoa. And not overrated really
","I'm not usually very emotional with these kind of emotional family films but this is was an exception.Now when I've grown up and watched in good quality as it could be I was totally shocked. I remembered from the age I was little kid that it was just cool touching and healing and something... Now it was little different experience.For the time being I think this is the most superb movie of 80's and I don't usually like Spielberg very much but this was fantastic. Original and all. Not some Independence Day like nowadays. Alien was really alien and brilliant movie, funny moments and all. Great directing, everything fits just like a glove.Maybe long movie but this one deserves it really. If you are not addicted only to some Transformers and have feelings, humor, sense of irony, childhood memories this is movie I'd never forget.Didn't cry though but ha... well. Great family scifi movie and year 1982 whoa.12/10 if it could be possible. In its own genre, some might hate this but everyone have their own tastes, genres and all. For scifi freaks must to see if somehow missed, or if watched as a kid and don't remember much at all.",10,1,2,11 September 2013
Fight Club," The Second Rule...
","Some people don't realize the violence at all, some does too well. This is like a movie of what would happen if suddenly something snaps in an brilliant office workers head. Too easy job, too much brains, no sleep.I kind of got similar to the main character, I had sleeping problems like 6 months and between that time I saw this movie. It really freaked me out because I was feeling exactly the same way.You might think that movie called like Fight Club cannot get deep in your mind. Don't underestimate The Fight Club. Try to use your brains if you have ones when watching, otherwise you lose a lot. Movie actually goes so deep that you might get wondering about most of the ppl who go to work everyday and might not realize it's the last day of their lives. from eight to four, every weekday, working overtime, like getting nowhere but still doing work. Buying everything, believing it makes you feel good.Can't say much about this movie without spoilers so watch it or miss it. One of the best movies I've seen and kind of messes around with your head especially if you're a movie freak. Most artistic etc. movies makes you think lots of ideas and conclusions for everything but really doesn't give any answer, like wondering blind and trying to figure out what might be happening. Here you find at least answers, better look at least few times if you liked it first time.",9,0,2,22 May 2006
Shutter Island," Never trust an island...
","This was really interesting movie, I didn't except this even from Scorsese. I've never read the book but movie worked so 101% that I cannot understand what would book be alike.Dicaprio have had many good roles on his career (except titanic etc. which I hate..) This time it felt like he is no longer just any young boy. Did great acting, I didn't see any stupid moments. Good for him.Anyway story is really superb, casting is great, directing is great, almost everything is great. I had feelings at some parts that movie was going to end (didn't watch time line) but then again it raises more and is more interesting like a movie should be for my opinion.If you like to use your mind while watching movie don't drink while watching this one. I got chills for some issues when watching this midnight being tired.Worth of watch maybe best movie of prison/nut-house concept. Thanks to my dear friend I didn't miss this :)",10,1,5,30 June 2010
Pacific Rim," Omg what a cr**... and so long :)
","I was in hope that good CGI, good acting and all that, good script...Well actually this was like watching Transformers, Matrix Reloaded, Hulk... what ever there is, put together and I was gonna sleep most of the movie.The beginning was quite interesting but then everything went out of hands... And effects were pretty good.. Right. Horribly illoginal the whole script after first minutes. Well Transformers fans might be amazed I was just darn bored.And those clichés were so brainless. Maybe some kid would like this but I dunno actually if this is even science fiction, more like waste of time (for me) Well had to see, 4/10 for decent mainstream action flick but I'd would probably cut half of of this one TOO Long.. goddamn :DNot much to say, most boring action I have ever seen and the script failed totally. Go ahead, waste your time... maybe really some dudes like this a lot when looking at the average points but mine is purely 4/10, and maybe for good try. Hope they don't do this kinda crap anymore.",4,3,7,14 October 2013
Rush," Best formula movie I've ever seen!
","Although movie was bit long I didn't feel any boring moment. Languages and all somehow provoked me. It was just so real.This might be little deep but nowadays formulas are so different and this was fantastic experience of human heart.From beginning to the end I was amazed, they don't even get so good shots in real formula-races, that was also one big HUGE feature. No stupid CGI and feeling was strong all along.I don't watch these kind of movies usually they are so boring but this woke me up, like what if you lived your life like every day was the last one huh? To be honest, this was most entertaining film I have seen in years, forget the category if you cant stay awake for few hours because there is no explosions or so then go back to the grad school... Even if you didn't like formulas, driving, watching driving this has something so deep in it that it flows in you. Even if you are bored at the beginning and so 'this movie is full of crap' etc. try to watch 'till the end.Totally enjoyable and inspiring! This is how formulas should go even nowadays but they sadly doesn't.10/10 with super experience.",10,5,7,6 January 2014
Oblivion," Tom Cruise in sci-fi movie? Couldn't been better, actually was brilliant.
","Very intellectual and interesting good sci-fi movie for a long time.I had some thoughts of 'what the heck is this?' because Tom Cruise in such a movie but happily I was wrong.Great character development, great plot, directing acting and all.Movie had everything one can want in this genre, CGI was fitted perfectly to other things going around and there wasn't too much explosions or so to make it success, this one didn't need those. Also I liked the future scene, very unique.. brilliant. And those droids were so cool looking.. Usually they are some ready-made crap.Only thing that I missed was in the end, the story development because it was kind of twisted too long, there could have been something but maybe it was just good as it was. Cant get any bad thoughts about this one.10/10 truly.",10,3,7,27 July 2013
American Psycho," Great horror-comedy made of a great book
","Christian Bale does great casting in this funny, sarcastic and sick comedy. Although lot of scenes were taken directly from the book, this is totally different. Yes, there is Bateman, Louis, Evelyn and others but putting this together as a movie makes it truly humorous. Book itself wasn't so humorous, lot of sarcasm painted with black humor and sick stuff all over detailed, still this movie isn't much of a horror movie at all.For those who hadn't read the book...It's late in 1980s. Movie follows the story of a 27 years old Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street broker with lots of money and nothing to lose. Patrick is kind of a person that doesn't care about anything, doesn't get any satisfaction of anything, self-hatred, schizophrenic person and doesn't like anybody. Still he is wearing his mask of sanity to spread in, not to be noticed too much in the crowd so that he can execute his sick fantasies for real. Or does he..? Very much fun watching, great characters, great directing, never really losing to touch. Some people just can't understand this movie. It's a movie you shouldn't take too seriously and still, you haven't to be empty-minded while watching.This is good.Great movie, 9/10. Anyway I recommend first reading the book, then watching the movie. I don't think I'd get it at all if I hadn't read book first.Truly worth of watching for most people and of course horror-movie fans especially.",9,0,0,23 May 2006
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Great bed time story for adults
","Brave movie truly. I excepted something totally different again.First of all this is the story of Hansel and Gretel hunting witches traveling through good old lands, somehow because of things about their childhood. This is not for very little kids, teenagers might laugh at this 'cause its so stupid or so...Anyway I was mostly surprised by the balance between script, directing, acting, action, comedy and all. There were no boring moments in any moment, it kept me watching interested throughout the movie.There are some funny cowboy scenes and so, it fits pretty fine, not too much humor. Nice to see some makeup in movies nowadays, not all cgi or something. There were elements that made me wonder why do they need actually CGI with this kind of movies.Very enjoyable, not scary at all for adults just funny mostly. Nice atmosphere and everything you want for good night sleep. Really like an adult bed time story.If you want to take a break from too serious movies or such this is brilliant choice.Recommend this totally. Maybe the 'minuses' are that there were no any totally surprising moments although it kept going really well.8/10",8,0,2,16 May 2013
Django Unchained," My favorite Tarantino -movie so far wow
","Didn't quite except anything about this movie, only that I've never seen any Tarantino movie that I didn't much like (only those 'Tarantino Presents' where he is not director or writer) We'll first of all this isn't maybe very interesting movie for racists or Nazis...Basically this movie is like it's name tells. Surrounded by Django and other man its awesome journey.Awesome dialog, scenes, script, acting, music, mood and all. Nothing bad to say about this one.This had all the elements of excellent intellectual action movie that there can be, you don't get bored in the whole movie, it keeps you sharp every second.Like I said before, not for racists and so... its more like slave thing and other things. Really got good mood when watched this. The beginning was totally funny, cool and unexpected, accents were very funny and good, dialog too, some game play with those. You will also get very much laughs from them.This was pretty much my personal opinion but hope this will clear out the movie for some who haven't seen this. 10/10 with RESPECT! Go for it Quentin go and never stop you are just getting better all the time.",10,2,5,23 April 2013
2012," Entertaining non-minded funny 'catastrophy' movie...
","This was like a weird thing to do watching 'cause it was 18.12.2012 ..Humorlously I don't really care about catastrophe-movies never did and so.This one was still very funny from the beginning, entertaining, didn't have to use brains (i took this as sleeping movie..) somehow i managed to watch this throughout from beginning to end.Funny acting like everyone is 'whoa whoops' like you slipped on floors or something when world is coming to an end, I laughed out loud. I guess that was mainly the idea ;) And the Mayans story, everybody knows the legend ..The minuses: 1) TOO long. 2) first part of the movie was real funny and get me laughing a lot but then like director was changed the movie entered to more 'serious' theme and that didn't quite fit in this humorous set. 3) Totally illogical :D .. but there also comes PLUS with it, this beats titanic lol .. you know what i mean if you watch this. Titanic was based on true happenings though.So I guess 7/10 is not bad or so. It does its premises and so .. nothing quite spectacular but yeah worth of watch :) If you take things too seriously or are afraid all the time in theaters don't watch this you miss the humor. Thats for me now, I have a Galaxy to explode.",7,3,4,19 December 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," Best of the trilogy
","I was truly surprised when I watched this. I like x-men comics etc. so that might effect a bit.First one was OK movie and interesting if you read comics. Second had more action but not too interesting, effects and stuff seen that been there. I was almost certain that third can't be better than first or second one. How wrong was I.Storyline was very very interesting, first surprise. Second surprise was that effects were really enjoyable, kind of original style, no Matrix-copies or such. Third one... well lets just say that everything was enjoyable, interesting, not too stupid, had great moments and such.Even tough there were so much action and effects it wasn't boring, not just blow ups and kicks. In such a short movie it's so hard to get everything fit in without some mess. Somehow they did.I truly think this is best one of the series. Gotta see this if you like comics! 9/10.",9,0,2,13 June 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," I was wrong, actually this one was pretty good in my opinion.
","Forget the actual story, almost everything about it, then you might like this. This film doesn't use just some humor to amuse watchers, its damn lot more.I don't surely like this thing changing the original story with all Marvel things but hey, its great entertaining very well made movie? Little cheesy at times but I didn't got bothered. Nice directing and cgi, actors weren't bad at all, all it was that little thing that I would like to call something like 'do not push every stuff in one movie'. Anyway it somehow worked well. First I rated this 6/10 after seeing some low-level version, it probably had missing parts and all. When I now watched c001 bluray-version it was totally different.Even if you don't bare these mainstream films much like I don't, it was excellent movie.Ending was little weird and all but so they are all :) 8/10 Terrific job!",8,25,42,2 August 2014
Paranormal Activity," Paranoid activity at the worst.
","For Jesus Christ this was most boring movie ever made in my watch list.Remimded me of Blair witch and so, there isn't actually nothing to see. Just some weirdo 'we will film this real time' storyline so crappy I almost felt asleep.Ghostbusters #2 was truly disappointed for me but this one was worse.Pretty nice idea. I think. Copied so much from other movies. How come? There is no horror or any other issue of ghosts etc.For god sakes no more these movies. It would be same like someone took cam-stuff and little edit.But yes, this did kinda interest on me, sadly I didn't like this, waste of time.One cannot argue with likes this was just simply stupid in my category.3/10 says me. (actually the cam-crap was so unbelievable stupid to make Blair witch again with paranormal gross...)",3,1,2,26 January 2013
The Fountain," Darren did it again .. nice surprise!
","How to begin...This movie is real hard to explain without spoilers but I'll try to.I was pretty much convinced that this wouldn't be very good at all, watchable but not so good, this was.Movie needs some 'time space' to encapsulate your brains, watch this in dark alone, sober and concentrate. This needs thinking you know.Great storyline, different type what I have seen before from Darren but successfully creates ultimately original movie. At first movie was little boring, didn't really have a clue what it's all about, my friend just advised me to watch this and i didn't want to spoil it by crawling through reviews etc.Main story; love story. Beginning, the middle and the End.So here we go with Sumerian believes and all, very interesting thoughts, how we did born why did we born and all that stuff, very very religious movie even I'm not too religious I like this kind of movies.It appears to be trans-dimensional work of art, you really have to watch this like it was plugged in your brain to make it work. Only watched once and didn't got bored, more like interested a lot.Philosophy in this film, the screenplay, great cast again funny, Darren always succeeds in that .. He must have some God-issue if comparing to PI etc. Simillarities but very different .. Evolution, great fx (not too much cgi but just so nicely fitting) Well if you are open minded, watch lot of movies, like other works of Darren and so, and don't except any action packed crap this is for you.Not much to say, one hell of a work. From beginning to end.Few things why I didn't give it 10/10: little too much (and not needed) ideas copied from other movies involving time traveling and so.. Little boring at times when the time jumps way there way here and almost get confused. But thats just the great stuff :) Keeping up with the storyline and focusing on atmosphere, actors, everything, the main idea.Darren, please continue this kind of movies. You are truly markable and original. Got good night sleep when watched....and I agree with warren-10 abt 20 minutes more, the ending was pretty fast comparing to length, it wasn't long but felt long. Then the ending just came there suddenly.Thank you Darren :) Respect! 9/10",9,1,4,14 December 2012
Inception," Great movie but maybe too great
","Firstly this movie is about dreamworld, where everything is possible, like Matrix but other way. Plot is very well written and done on screen, made me watch few times before I realized everything.It's like a movie you want to see alone, so you could somehow keep up with the story. Lucid dreams came to my mind almost in the beginning, it kept my interest in the film.I felt like I'm watching two movies at the same time, no actual characters that you could get similar to, that was maybe good, movie itself was already confusing enough.The end-part was so boring that I almost fell asleep, very well done though :)Final inception, I liked the theme and the movie, only thing I missed was something that get similar to. Dream in a dream etc. wasn't exactly my normal dreaming.9/10",9,2,14,6 February 2011
Scream," Screaming makes it so scary, doesn't it?
","This movie Scream was pretty much a surprise when I first saw it. I was waiting for some stupid horror movie like those ones seen everywhere and I was wrong.The whole movie concentrates on parody and irony, its more than just a horror movie its comedy. If you have seen those older 'same plot same stuff' movies maybe you can adapt to the Scream itself.Great plot, seems sometimes like trying to be a scary movie but no, there are lots of funny things for a horror fan if you are recalling them but also there's parts that are little nasty for younger viewers.I recommend this first one to all horror movie freaks if you wanna get some beer and get some kicks with the parts that you realize 'lol it was from movie blah-blah' :)Plot really is great but it have been built on older ones and can't be taken too seriously, It made me laugh. Beginning was little more scarier than rest of the movie.Still not for little kids some guys take this movie too seriously.9/10",9,0,0,29 March 2011
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Too long, the longer version but pretty amazing.
","Once I felt asleep while watching, did watch that longer version. Only thing that bothered me mostly was the length.Man of Steel was back and batman choice was pretty weird, but it worked. Then they messed up with all kinda things during the movie, in two parts it would have been better, maybe that shorter version is more comfortable.Well an adult movie about superheroes was nice to see, even it was DC and didn't wait such a ... anyways if you are a fan must to see. I loved it. Some villains or heroes I didn't quite understand but nevertheless it was really good. I didn't seem quite fit that Batman goes after Superman, in the comic books they were friends but after all this happened before it. Really much fun for watching.Keep sharp or see the shorter version, that's my opinion. Superman was truly bad ass so was Batman. Way to go!8/10 from me.",8,1,7,4 July 2016
The Matrix," Superhero in a dream
","Please don't read this if you haven't seen matrix.First I saw The Matrix in theater without any knowledge about the film nor my friends hadn't seen it.I'm a coder with weird mathematic background since I was born but still I can be objective with things like this.The Matrix script hadn't really any new ideas. The whole movie is very illogical and acting is really cliché way. Still my opinion of this movie is that it appears to be most original scifi movie of the 90's.The thing was that whole movie was put together thinking everybody, first rule of making money. The ones who doesn't understand this 'geek' thingy, they get real nice action and effects etc., drama lovers get their kind of love story, geeks get their 'whoa's and real movie freaks get the whole picture. First time when I watched this movie I was like 'huh?' when it ended. I sure thought it was just starting and looked at clock .. No other movie had never done this to me.The battery idea is funny even if everyone says its stupid. Hey, some humor? Thats the mainstream crap ;) Then those pathetic 'I KNEW IT, HE IS THE ONE!' etc. boring crap, well, there are very very young kids watching that film and there is a hero, so i don't really think it was so annoying. People who saw this in year 2000 or later they probably think 'what.. i've seen this, basic crap again'. I think that makers of this movie were aware of that at the time, they just wanted to make their thing and knew it would be copied later in other movies. Thats probably why Matrix 2 & 3 were so .. well, so different. If I understood correctly they had them written long ago before starting, they might have had to blow up some scenes to get any attention.I think Matrix is the Star Wars of 90's. Don't you think Star Wars ideas were copied in many movies after that? ..and I didn't really like those prequels, third was 'okay'. Good bless Jar Jar ;)",10,0,1,22 May 2006
Looper," Really interesting plot, little confusing
","Story begins... In year 2074 we develop time-travel (woa) and it is illegal. Nice to begin with.Then there are certain 'loopers' who are assassins for the mob, killing people their bosses send back in time and get some silver for doing this.Very interesting story, not just another time travel movie. What if you saw yourself to be killed, do you want to kill your own self? And is it you because its from the future? Makes you think really hard those time traveling gaps is it working in the main idea..In Terminator movies I kinda laughed for those time-travel things, 'question was, who would come first' kinda very illogical.This movie didn't have many gabs, at least I didn't notice much. Surely it is confusing jumping from time to time like traveling from country to country and back.So, nice cast, nice directing, funny surprise moments that little cheers up the movie, good plot and hard to direct Im sure. Something still was missing. Ending was little weird and it wasn't really following logic but it didn't matter much.Little too long and character development was unstable, actually there really wasn't much.Still great movie if you like the genre. Not too much clichés etc. Little CGI, just enough, and future was really nicely done, somehow more realistic than in any movie I've ever seen.8/10 .. Could have been better but this wasn't bad either.",8,3,7,17 December 2012
Moon," Brilliant and unique sci-fi movie for a long time
","Very unique science fiction movie for a long time.Total isolation in the moon, getting weirder all along the movie, really felt isolated while watching this in the evening.I felt like Space Odyssey 2001 and HAL most of the time, also Alien3 came to mind, it was fascinating. Great performance from actors, mostly Sam Rockwell who made this actually believable.For a low budget movie I'd say this was brilliant, script and all. Directing was also very good and made me wonder what would they have done with bigger budget.Best sci-fi movie for a long time, really. If you enjoy sci-fi and very confusing plot I recommend this, it makes your brain tickle. This wasn't even too long or anything, just long enough to make it whole. Also the philosophical side was truly amazing like every ground breaking sci-fi movie should do.Huge thanks to creators of this movie. Saved my evening truly.Don't except much of an action or space traveling this is something totally different.",10,3,12,13 April 2013
True Romance," True Romance with this movie
","True Romance is truly unique movie if you are at least fan of some sort of originally made movies. Quentin Tarantino and Tony Scott's makes this almost perfect.Casting is great also plot is great, it gives you fresh feeling and happy face. No other movie is like this. Story begins in Detroit and goes around, every moment gets better. Even the soundtrack is so wonderful you can't be bored.Really good storyline, keeps you awake and waiting the next step every minute, sometimes makes you laugh and sometimes even cry if you are romantic type person.Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater, Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken ... No more need to say.I love this movie truly from my heart, I recommend to anyone who has IQ more than 20 ;)10/10",10,5,7,7 February 2011
