Howl's Moving Castle," Pure Magic.
","Well done Mr. Miyazaki, you have proved once again that you can combine an excellent story line, creative imagination and visually stunning artwork to create magic. This movie upholds all standards of a Miyazaki film.When I first started watching this, I imagine my first impression was similar to those of many other: slight confusion, but incredibly mystified by the concept, unable to look away. It has the surreal and dreamy feel of Alice In Wonderland, and I couldn't help but be drawn into the story. The characters are well rounded, and the relationships between them are very interesting. The film has an incredible knack of surrounding you with all these events, thoughts and a dream-esqe atmosphere that you want to watch it again and again to relive this strange world. The soundtrack was lovely as well, and this movie is one I highly recommend to anyone open to being brought into a fantastic world you couldn't possibly imagine.",9,0,1,31 December 2011
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," This is what film should look like.
","Alright, I'll start off by complaining about the rating. 7.6? Are you kidding me?! This movie is the product of what happens when you stop caring about how to please the audience or how to make the most money and actually film a beautiful movie for the sake of telling a story.The cynic in me wants to comment on how the 'Black and Tans' look like Hitler's personal army, but that thought is quickly hushed because this movie presents itself so well. No fancy over the top special effects are necessary to re-create a time that literally split a country in two. It's a story that'll make you feel for all the characters, and the message of this story is timeless: 'No one wins when in war'So the plot? The plot is about two brothers: Damien (Cillian Murphy) and Teddy (Padraic Delaney) who join the IRA to help fend off and rebel against the English forces that govern Ireland. But when the English give their own proposition: it seems like the entire country is divided between whether to quiet down and accept it or to continue fighting until the end. What a marvelous example of a beautiful film. I'll start with the acting. As usual, Cillian Murphy is amazing and completely draws you into the character. Padraic Delaney was also very well acted, and you could honestly believe that they were two brothers, torn between what they think is best for their country and people. The other characters, even those who have a minor role make you feel as if you are a part of this war. You will cry and cheer for the characters as they fight for freedom.Ken Loach deserves special recognition for how he wanted this movie to be portrayed. It's not a war movie where over-macho, testosterone-filled jug heads like to blow up anything that's wearing a different colored T- shirt then them. Instead this movie focuses on the emotions and feelings that the people are experiencing. It's about the voice of the people at a desperate time. It's about the courage to stand up for what you believe and to come together as one to unite and defend your country. And Ken Loach does such an amazing job at showing us exactly what happens when you are faced with decisions regarding your personal interest, and the interest of the people as a whole. There is one scene in particular where the town is at church that I replayed over and over again, just for the sheer tension, emotion, and opinions that are shown of the townsfolk. As for the 'controversial views' that many critics seem to latch onto? As far as I'm concerned, it's a very well acted, presented and shot movie that draws you in. That's it: that's what a movie is. It's ridiculous to assume that 'everyone is good and lives happily ever after': it's the story of a country's fight for independence. I could keep on rambling about how amazing and spectacular this movie is: but if you really want to experience it: watch it! There's just too much to talk about. It's refreshing to see a movie step away from the 'safe' views of Hollywood and go back to the roots of what movies are really about.So in a nutshell? Amazing movie, I recommend it to anyone who knows how to appreciate a fantastic film. I loved it and have watched it many times since. It made me smile but most of all made me bawl like a little girl. Watch it and you won't regret it.",10,0,4,20 August 2011
Les Mis√©rables," Carrying a tune in bucket with holes
","First off, I will clarify my decision by saying that I have read the book 'Les Miserables' by Victor Hugo, and seen many movies, plays and adaptations (both in English and in French), so it's fair to say that I have seen this piece many a times. I'll start off by pointing out the positives.Anne Hathaway as Fantine was by far the strongest of the cast. Her voice was both melodic and heart breaking. She deserves all her recognition and praise for this role. Fantine has always represented the downtrodden that unfortunately can't get back up. Anne Hathaway understands this and plays her role wonderfully. Next, I really enjoyed how they portrayed the Revolution and introduced characters that sometimes get ignored in other productions: namely Eponine and Enjolras (as well as the rest of the ABC friends). It's great to see this film actually portray what was a big part of Victor Hugo's story and how it wasn't just a background set piece: it added a lot to the film to see the preparation and the actual Revolution. The costumes and makeup were very well done as well (although I am not an expert, but they certainly held my attention). I also enjoyed the smooth camera work. Tom Hooper has an excellent reputation with artistic filming. The comic relief was also very well done (praise to the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen).Unfortunately, I must stop my praise there. The first and biggest problem I had with the movie was the singing. This is coming from someone who loves the opera and Broadway musicals of all kinds. I am certainly not against movie-musicals either (Sound Of Music, Fiddler on the Roof, etc.) but unfortunately, this movie missed a big mark: singing. I feel like many people have forgotten that all these actors are just that: actors. And while they may have had voice lessons and professional coaches, none of them are professional singers. This doesn't mean that they did a bad job (As I mentioned, Fantine was very well done, as well as some of the others), but it takes away a lot from the movie. Let's be honest: Russel Crowe is NOT a singer. He is a wonderful actor, but he is not a singer. As well as Hugh Jackman, for his acting and emotions were very well done, his singing was sub par. This is a big miss considering he and Russel Crowe are the main characters. I wish instead of using big name celebrities, they would have found people who could simultaneously sing and act, or if the movie hadn't focused on the singing (which probably deters from the point of the movie). Unfortunately, this movie falls short mainly because of that. If you listen to the London Broadway version, you will hear exactly how much better the emotions and the story becomes when it's sung professionally. I have a few other knit picks: such as why did some of the actors have cockney British accents when it's a French story in France? I was also a little disappointed by the romance between Cosette and Marius. In the book, they do fall in love at first glance, but here, even that feels a bit...rushed. Which is a paradox to my next criticism, the timing. I feel the pacing of the movie could have been better. Some parts were riveting and exciting, but some just seemed to drag on (which I suppose were used to create contrast, but just annoyed me). I understand that the book is over a thousand pages long and it's very hard to decide which parts are 'important' or not, but I feel it could have been done better. My final verdict is that it was an OK movie. Nothing really stood out to me. It's all been done before (but in this day and age, what hasn't?) and I wish they would have invested more time on the singing (considering it's a core part of the film).",5,1,5,19 January 2013
The Great Gatsby," Misses on subtlety, scores on lead
","Let me start off by saying I have an automatic bias: I've read the original novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, so this review is coming from the standpoint of someone who knows and enjoys the story. Now let's talk about some good things in this movie. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did a wonderful job as Gatsby, he was perfect for such a complex role. He never overdid it or underplayed Gatsby which I appreciated. He played the character very well and you could feel his hopefulness and blindly romantic personality radiate from the screen. Carey Mulligan wasn't too bad either. I've heard complaints about Tobey Macguire's performance, but I honestly didn't mind. None of the actors were awful, most were either OK or did really well. I also loved the costumes and the actual parties of the movies. I don't know how accurate any of it is (although I suspect some of the party scenes were a little too modernized, but we'll get to that in a minute), but it was visually pleasing. The changes to the story were obvious but didn't distract.Now on to some of my complaints. I think a million people have said this already but I want to say it again: the symbolism. Fitzgerald was a master at weaving in subtle symbols and parallel metaphors with each of his stories. In the book, the green light is talked about maybe once and then at the end. Here, it's every five minutes. I know the director must have wanted everyone to understand it, but shoving it in our faces is not the way to go. The audience can think for themselves, so it's up to them to draw their own conclusions. The end result of Gatsby's blind ambition is detracted somewhat because the green light isn't as powerful as in the book. Some of the music choices I completely disagreed with: Kanye West, Jay Z, and some form of Dubstep in a movie set in 1920's? I understand the need to connect with a modern audience, and it worked in Romeo and Juliet. But it only worked because Romeo and Juliet is a story that can be told at any time (seriously, does anyone actually know off the top of their head what year it's set in?). The Great Gatsby is suppose to be set in the 1920's and can only be set in that time period because that decade created these characters and those circumstances. There had to be a stock market boom, there had to be a war, there had to be a shift in the way people lived their life. So to try and modernize it with 2013 rapping is kind of an insult to the book.My final major complaint is the editing. I don't know how many times the focus switched sporadically between Daisy and Nick in that one conversation at the beginning of the movie, but it was distracting. It felt like the movie was going much too quickly, it kept jumping here, there and everywhere.My final review? Other then the subtlety, the editing and the music, it's a pretty good movie. The atmosphere is solid and you get drawn into this world quite easily. I say check it out, if not for the sole reason of DiCaprio's performance, because he is indeed, the Great Gatsby.",6,2,4,19 May 2013
