E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
","I first saw this movie when I was 5, and I liked it pretty well.  My parents even bought for me...and I don't think I've watched it since (other than clips).  I cannot remember most of the jokes and dialogue in the movie, but I remember the big picture still.  After all, the movie is still popular.Let me start by saying that Spielberg entered in this movie some of the best aspects of filmaking and also some of the worst.  The movie is magical, especially for a young child.  The relationship between E.T. and the boy is indeed heartwarming, and the special effects are good enough to compete with Cameron. However, the disappointing aspects of this film overweighed the good in my mind.  This movie was rated PG-13 in some European countries.  Why? Spielberg lures kids in to watch this movie, only to tell them that parents are close-minded and completely out of touch with kids, while also encouraging children to defy their parents when they 'know' all the answers. Now granted, Spielberg doesn't come right out and say it, but for very young kids, this atmosphere could be harmful.Moreover, much of the movie is directed to people who fall in love with lots of cute things.  I don't mind cute movies, but it is overdone in a movie which is meant to be a sci-fi movies for kids, and a serious drama for adults.  There are also many contrivances and plot holes that I believe are only accepted because the director was Speilberg and because it was a 'cool' sci-fi flick.  However these do not affect my rating of the movie, as I also am willing to ignore some poor or formulaic writing when the rest of the movie is great.It seems I am in the minority on this movie.  Even AFI has it 25th best all time on their list.  But even throwing away all my personal taste, the message sent in this movie would still detract me from rating it among the classics.I give it a 4 (out of 10) for effort.",4,4,10,3 August 1999
All Quiet on the Western Front," READ THE BOOK!!!
","I only gave this movie a 6 out of 10, but maybe that is because I read the book first.  The movie, while pretty good, does not do the story justice. The book captures the imagination so vividly that any glorifying thought of war is immediately stricken from your memory.  If you do not have the time to read, or just cannot get into a book, at least pick up the movie. Portraying war from a non-American perspective not only gives us a better respect for other cultures, but also a better idea of what war actually does to humans and to society.  Ten times more powerful than Saving Private Ryan, this book is an absolute must-read for anyone.",6,5,12,21 July 1999
High Fidelity," Should've brought my gun...I mean this should be fun!
","If Only.Cusack is one of my favorite actors and he again struts his stuff in High Fidelity.  His talent for developing a believable character is extraordinary; sometimes I think his characters reflect parts of him.  Then again, parts of his character in High Fidelity could reflect on a lot of people.Anyway, the character development in High Fidelity is fantastic, the dialogue is realistic and often funny, and the writing is unique and fresh.But...the whole movie felt like some really bad sex.  Foreplay for an hour and a half, and just when you think there might be a satisfying climax, it doesn't really come, and you leave smoking a bad cigarette. 
I don't like being teased with a plot that doesn't really grow.  Either make a movie with a plot or make a movie without one.  I know this movie and the characters are more or less realistic, but that doesn't mean I find the general public very interesting, and would want to continue viewing these anecdotes.  Besides, one can only digest so many 'Top 5' lists from someone who's terribly difficult to care about.  Without a plot, I wouldn't have tried to care about him, and would've enjoyed his character more.I think the director tried to hit every base in the world with this movie. For many, it does.  For me, Frears tripped over second base gawking at his own talent.",6,1,2,7 July 2000
