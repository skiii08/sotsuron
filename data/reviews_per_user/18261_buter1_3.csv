Sucker Punch," Good movie, not just action
","The movie touches on a lot of themes other than the action, which was very good. The treatment of mental patients, how they might see the world they are powerless to interact with, and how the trusting the government to take care of people is a huge mistake.The movies visuals are just fantastic, and many of the mini-adventures are really, really cool. The asylum people are just evil. Slimy, disgusting, evil. Also, DO NOT take small children to see this. They will probably have nightmares, and will ask lots of hard questions, if they do.Spoilers One thing many miss is that the orderly is giving up the father-in-law at the end. So, while we won't see justice served on film, that slimeball will be arrested.I felt bad for Baby Doll, but I also figured out what was going to happen really quick. If you're read 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge', you will also not be surprised.",9,3,8,2 April 2011
The Hunger Games," Good, but missing a lot
","I read the first 'Hunger Games' book a few months back, and really enjoyed it. Today, I saw the movie.I thought it was pretty good, but not great. It REALLY needed another 20 minutes or so during the actual Games. Many characters that are quite important in the book (especially Rue and Cato), are barely shown in the movie, and give us little or no reason to care about them.A big chunk of the movie was the lead-up to the actual Games. I understand there was a lot to get through, especially for people unfamiliar with the book, but it took too much time away from the actual premise of the movie.I will give the director solid props for conveying just how much the people were afraid of being selected to compete, and Jennifer Lawrence's scene (as Katniss) right before going up the tube was extremely well done. She's a fantastic actor.In fact, almost all of the actors were great. The only one I thought was kinda average was Peeta, and I think that had more to do with his voice tone than anything. Still, he did a good job overall.The main bad guy (Cato) in the book was not even much of a presence on screen. The knife girl did a better job showing that she was dangerous. The big black kid was probably on screen less than two minutes, and he was a major concern during the Games as well.Again, Rue was REALLY not done well. I blame this on the editor. The actress did fine, but the movie just plain didn't show why she was so important to Katniss. Her character should have had at least five more minutes of screen time just to explain their bond.The finishing scenes were decent, but the very end was ambiguous, at best, for anyone who hasn't read the book.",7,3,10,11 April 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Fantastic superhero movie
","I saw 'Captain America' earlier tonight. Fantastic movie! The vast majority of the movie is set during World War Two. The movie does a great job of showing the transformation of Steve Rogers into Captain America. I won't post any spoilers, but I think most people are going to be very happy with how this movie was done.Highlight performances were Chris Evans as Cap, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Phillips, Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull, Stanley Tucci as Dr. Erskine, and the whole crew of Cap's Team during WW2. Really, the acting was top-notch throughout.I liked the plot a lot. It kept a nice pace, unless you are an action junkie who gets upset if something doesn't blow up every minute. Cap was believable. Not overblown, not a tough-guy, just a good man who wants to do right. I LOVED how he was portrayed. Major kudos to the writers and director.Overall, I think this is my favorite superhero movie to date. It slightly edges out 'The Dark Knight' and 'Iron Man' and 'Thor'.",10,13,32,23 July 2011
