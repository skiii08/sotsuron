","Finally a movie worth writing a comment about. It was original and not some three minute remake of an existing movie or a cookie cutter piece of crap. I like the suspense and a cast of unfamiliar faces that doesn't have you thinking of the last movie you saw that super famous type cast actor in. Keeping the how and what of everything that happened before the opening scene makes for a good way stay interested in this film. This movie had that 12 monkey's feel to it but very different. Overall I like it and would recommend this to all who want to spend there time with quality entertainment. I hope to see more original based movies produced, as hard as that is now a days.",10,0,2,9 April 2011
