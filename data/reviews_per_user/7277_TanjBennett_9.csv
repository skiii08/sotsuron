Mission: Impossible III," fading into generic star action vehicle
","The heart is gone out of MI. There is just the one moderately smart sequence in the Vatican which has the old MI flavor, and all the rest is just Cruise smiling, Cruise being tough, Cruise and true love, Cruise the action man. Heck they even gut one of the toughest puzzles with a pointless starting stunt and then just cut to the exit. I guess it really was impossible, so just skip it...Everyone does a good job with what the script handles them. First class cast. It is just the script really doesn't hand anyone but Cruise that much to do. Even the much hyped villain's performance dripping evil - uh, not so much, when you factor in the limitations of the script. Just a generic villain.Is this the one which rescues the franchise? Nah, Cruise owns the franchise, and it is going exactly where he envisages it: as a vehicle focused on him. Disappointing, given the roots of the franchise.Plenty of big budget action in exotic locations reduced to nothing memorable. No lingering images or 'I gotta visit there' heart to them.Oh, Maggie Q's line 'but its a NICE CAR!', that had impact.",4,0,1,4 June 2006
Ocean's Twelve," sequence of mostly listless cameos and no thrill
","Summary says it all. Oh heck they want 10 lines here, hmm. Occasional nice scenery, photos of jets flying overhead in swivel/pan shots just like in the 60s. A few other nods to other films, like the laser dance Cassel does mocks Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. Actually, Cassel (or his stunt double) is consistently watchable, at least someone is having fun. Some of the cameos actually have some life, a few of the stars actually have enough dialog or action to occasionally show some chops. All the heists are boring. No use is made of the potential for suspense. In this case we won't need to worry about an unlucky 13, hopefully '12' ends this franchise.",2,1,2,2 July 2005
Lost in Translation," like the picture inside a locket
","It is interesting to see the dichotomy in how people view this film.  Some people focus on Japan and see it as a film about Japan.  Me, well I've been there many times and since the background is everyday events I was watching the actors, who are center frame in pretty much every frame.  And it is about their characters.  They're in an environment which is alien to them but not alienating, and it is the perfect setting for them to become introspective.And some see nothing happening.  Whereas I see a relationship bloom and flow to its conclusion in a way that both will probably remember and keep thinking about for the rest of their lives.  Maybe that perspective also depends on whether it has ever happened to you.Very nice.",9,0,0,28 February 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," at least it is short
","Why did they do this?  Apart from to make money of course...It does not have the low budget raw scary impact of the first.  It does not have the relentless pace of the evil high tech second.  And if you had seen neither and saw this one first, you would wonder what all the fuss is about.It does have more humor.  It manages to fit at least one innovative if rather long chase scene into the short run.  There is a plot, if you assume parts of it ended up on the cutting floor.  They actually get some space to act (except T-X, who has just one-liners and wicked good looks), even Arnold has some reasonable variety to perform.But, please don't let him come back.  The third adds nothing we needed.",5,0,0,14 July 2003
Monsters vs. Aliens," good fun, excellent 3D (IMAX version)
","Story, well a simple fun story. No deep attempt to moralize or philosophize, but enjoyable. Its a cartoon, OK? And the running time is not too long. Plenty of nice animation, good visual and dialog jokes. Might even be fun to watch a second time, though not if I have to pay for it.What is outstanding is the IMAX 3D. Head and shoulders better than what Disney did for Up. The IMAX version has a fast frame rate and electronic glasses which shutter each eye in sync with the film. The content is also rendered totally in 3D. So, things never feel layered. Motion scenes - and there are lots of action scenes - are stable and clear, better than ordinary cinema (they really do need to stop showing films at just 24 frames per second). So the 3D is immersive. You can sense things in the far distance as well as quite close. This is definitely how 3D should be done, and I give a 1 point bonus on my rating simply because this is a showcase for 3D done right and both audience and other film makers should raise their sights on 3D to meet or beat this quality level. It is a milestone.And a fun one.",8,0,1,2 July 2009
Spirited Away," Sen falls into a dreamworld of beauty, horror, and bravery
","Miyazaki is in a class by himself, with an imagination the West is mostly unaware of.  This tale was somewhat unexpected, many thought Mononoke no Hime was his magnum opus and finale, but in many ways Sen is a more approachable and timeless piece, it is wonderful to see he has resumed. The imagination draws on a floating world of ghosts and demons which has a Japanese character while it is also uniquely Miyazake, and nothing like you have seen in western animations.  The story line is universal, even if the dreamscape is strange (even to a Japanese person, this is an unexpected world), a story of a child discovering her inner resources, honesty, loyalty, and bravery to save herself, her friends, and her parents.And not to be forgotten, there is breathtakingly beautiful animation. The scenes of flight (a Miyazake hallmark), the riot of ghostly life, the vistas, the boat along the water .. both technical mastery and artistically balanced.  This is a film children can appreciate (though children too young to understand the abstractions may be truly scared) and has a depth to it that can allow an adult to watch it many times without tiring.It is somewhat better with the Japanese dialog than the English, as usual. Probably this is because Miyazake gets involved in the casting and dialog work too, in the original, and this seems lost in the translation.  If you've understood the story line in English you may one day consider watching it again in Japanese, just for the feel of it.",10,0,1,15 April 2003
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," loyalty, bravery, and adventure after an apocalypse
","This was the film which introduced me (and many others in the 1980s) to Miyazake, and even in the form of a poor quality VHS on an ordinary TV, it was amazing.  By 1984 Miyazake was already well known in Japan for his anime work in film, TV, and for the comic strip that this film was based upon.In this early full length film he really got to spread his wings.  There are fantastic aerial sequences like the jet-glider evading the flying snakes, which (this predates computed 3D, and aerial sequences are present in most of his work) are just a tour-de-force of imagination and geometry.  And yet this is a world that feels very organic, not geometric, with a cast of characters drawn in a unique cross between hobo, samurai, and pirate - totally blending in to an imaginary post apocalyptic world where humans scratch out a precarious life in villages hidden in the few green valleys left in a world of desert, where the only remaining resources are wind, sunlight, and humans.But it is also a world of enormous dangers, including airborne bandits and the strange, mutated creatures that have evolved to control the barren and scarred earth.  When our heroine's valley home is attacked by raiders, she embarks on an adventure against them that will lead her, and some unlikely allies found along the way, to an eventual confrontation combining warring armies of bandits, ancient machines of infernal destruction, and the implacable, mysterious, threatening beasts which roam the badlands.  The pace is swashbuckling - if this were a book, it would be one you could not stop reading.It has the feel of the original comic books, but plays out wonderfully on the screen - you don't need to know the comics.  The style is very unique. Even though it is very stylized (no photorealism here), you immediately get the feeling of the world and the characters.  The story works for children of all ages (mine both first saw this before they were 6, and have memorized it long since), and combined with the wonderful visuals it is a treat for adults too.  As a genre I would classify it as soft (no attempt at scientific correctness) sci-fi rather than fantasy, though some might think it more a work of fantasy.  It is fascinating partly because its roots in style and action are unexpected for a western viewer.  Japanese manga and stories had evolved in their own way, and although this is early Miyazake, it is already a product of that mature and distinct art form.As always with Miyazake - if you haven't seen his work, well you haven't seen anything like it, and it is time you did.",10,132,151,15 April 2003
Up," nice story, nice animation, disappointing 3D
","Yes, it is a nice story. No, I can't say it was wonderfully inspiring. The introduction to Ed's past life was touching and a cut above. The rest was pretty average 'let's tell kids an story with some adventure and a moral'. Yep, a good script. Not one I have any desire to see a second time.The quality of animation was fine, good artwork, Pixar very well done.Except for the 3D. It came in and out of use. Sometimes it seemed to have been drawn in layers. When there was motion, things got blurry and horrible, even worse than regular cinema. Yes, points for not giving us vertigo like some 30 year old drive-in. But other than that, this was just light years behind Monsters vs. Aliens in technical quality. Watching Up after seeing MvA was a bit like watching old NTSC TV on an old tube after having seen HDTV on a modern flat-screen. What were you thinking, Disney? This is not the future of cinema. I have to knock a full 2 points off for the terrible misuse of technology. Folks, don't go away thinking this is all 3D can do.",6,1,3,2 July 2009
Princess Mononoke," Allegory on the balance between humans and nature
","This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have 'gotten it' quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.",10,279,303,15 April 2003
