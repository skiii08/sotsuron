Walk the Line," Great Acting
","i must say that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were brilliant , thanks for a great performance. The producers who made the TV series Elvis should of seen this first.. The singing from Joaquin and Reese were very nice i really liked it. they could of casted a better Elvis but, thats not the center of the story so it's OK. I think Joaquin will win an Oscar each for their performances if they don't ,i think it's a big mistake.. I will see this movie many times more. Reese is so beautiful and her acting is as nice as her looks ! I think that this movie will make Joaquin Phoenix a legend , his performance was truly inspiring and i am glad i saw when i did, it will help me in the future as an actor..See it",8,0,0,9 February 2006
The Shining," Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson what can go wrong?
",Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson what can go wrong? The only answer is nothing..Stanley Kubrick is the best director of all time. Jack nicholson is one of the best actors of all time. The shining is one of the greatest movies of all time. I give it 10/10 Because of Kubricks beautiful artwork. The music is perfect and the actors are very carefully selected. I especially love one seen with Jack Nicholson. He is standing outside with a polo shirt and the camera slowly zoom in to his face. I think that is one of the best scenes ever. The boy who plays danny is extremely good. Shelley Duval looks like she's going to day because shes so scared. Jack is so passionated and alive he truly gives life to his character.If you should compare this movie with the Stepehn King TV Series. Its like comparing a Bottle of wine and a raisin. 10/10 See it ! I love it Rickard Lindquist GÃ¶teborg,10,0,1,9 November 2004
