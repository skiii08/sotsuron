The Blair Witch Project," Breaking the envelope never looked so good.
","*Minor Spoilers!!*This film deserves all the hype that it is getting. When the last shot (which is only 1-2 seconds long) gets thrown into a constant loop in your mind you know that what you have just witnessed was superbly powerful film making.The performances were outstanding and the actors should be highly commended for their work in this film. As should the directors.Okay, here's the criticism:  The night scenes needed to be longer. I wanted to be a little more scared. And I had a hard time believing that the 'documentary film makers' would continue to shoot even up to the very end.Can't wait to wade through the crappy, second rate, rip-offs this movie is going to produce. I give it an 8.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
Requiem for a Dream," great direction and editing doesn't make up for flat characters
","i really tried to look fondly back at this film as a 'groundbreaking' piece of art as so many have called it... but the more i think about requiem... the more i didn't like it...the directing and editing was superb... and i will see his next work based solely on the promise he shows as a very able director... both with pi and requiem...i couldn't relate to the characters... at all... i don't care what film it is... if you want your characters to cause emotional responces from your audience you have to make them connect with the audience... not just shock them with devious sex acts, severe infections, television obsession, and quick editing.and on top of not relating... i didn't like the characters... i thought they were more pathetic than anything... didn't feel sorry for them one bit... maybe sara... because i see my grandmother going through the same thing with just losing her husband... but that was it... not that my grandmothers a junky... just the pain she feels parallels the character.you want me to feel bad for a drug addict... give me sick boy, rent boy, or spud. those were characters that i felt sorry for... granted trainspotting is a different type of movie... but the characters related better to the audience... while still getting the same message across... drugs are bad.i gave it a seven because it tried so hard to be a ten...",7,0,0,9 December 2000
