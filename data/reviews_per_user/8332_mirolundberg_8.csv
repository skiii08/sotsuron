Ford v Ferrari," Good
","The movie was well made and from that I have read, mostly historically accurate. It had great actors, the ferrari's looked gorgeus along with the other cars. If some parts of the races were cgi (most likely some were) they weren't recoqnisable.It felt a bit off that the Italians were clearly made out to be the bad guys, with the drivers facial expressions among other things. Also we didn't see anything from Ferrari outside the racing scenes. I also would have really liked to see a bit of the cars design process, but no, the car just suddenly appeared out of no where and then we went on from that fixing the problems it had. Miles's wife's sudden mental breakdown in their car also felt off and was a bit strange. The movie generally left a lot of stuff unexplained, even though it was 2,5h long. Every time when the cars were racing music was playing in the background, I would have liked to have sometimes only hear the cars engines with no music.",8,0,1,18 November 2019
Rocketman," A pretty good movie, but I was left a bit underwhelmed...
","The movie was well acted, full of energy and quite entertaining. At times it just seemed like a big mess to me that I couldn't quite figure out. Also even though I am not an expert in regards to Elton John I still found myself after the movie thinking that I didn't learn that much more about Elton John.
EDIT: I now have read that this was not meant to be a biography type of movie.",7,2,3,14 September 2019
As Good as It Gets," Pretty good and an interesting movie but a bit strange.
","The movie was good for the most part and Nicholsons performance was great, but the ending just seemed bizzarre and Carol liking Melwin after everything just seemed very unrealistic to me. Nicholsons characters nice and mean personalities constantly swapping felt a bit off to me, actually the whole movie felt a bit off, but I still liked it enough to give a vague recommendation to someone.",7,0,1,20 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Good and a unique movie, but should have given more insight and focus more on the Manson stuff.
","It certainly was an entertaining, good and an unique movie, but I wish that it had given more insight on Cliff allegedly killing his wife, all we got was one scene with him on a boat with him. Also the Charles Manson cult plot was very small and a bit confusing.",8,5,7,20 August 2019
Gone Girl," A great movie, but
","The lack of a satisfying ending left me very unsatisfied, but I guess that was the point. It really bugged me though",9,1,2,5 October 2019
1917," A great film
","I was super excited to see this film just from watching the trailer, hearing about it and seeing the good reviews. I hadn't anticipated any film like this for a while and well it was great, perhaps not quite as great as my too high expectations were at one point, but still very good.
Acting was mostly good, but I did find Andrew Scott's character to be a bit too cliche and the move was perhaps very slightly a bit too unbelievable at times, but not too much.
This movie was made to appear as being just a single shot and I feel like that it fit this movie very well. In the beginning it was slightly claustrophobic, but overall it was great seeing the whole journey and kind of being a part of it. The films looks amazing (cinematography is mostly fantastic) and during the final moments of the movie the white trench section just looked amazing. The running/attack scene during the final moments was very epic. I feel like I am going to have to give this movie another watch in the future to fully appreciate it, or maybe I will find more faults in it.
The score wasn't outstanding but good and the overall sound of the film was good, not deafening unlike in some other movies these days. This was a great movie.",9,5,7,11 February 2020
Children of Men," A good movie, but with many things left unexplained, it leaves you with aunsatisfied feeling.
","An interesting and a different movie. It is a good watch and I definetly recommend it. If the movie would explain more things, like the state of the world, the refugee crisis, Theo's relationship with Jasper among many other things I would probably give it an eight.",7,0,6,25 July 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A comedy that also left room for very serious things.
","I want to start by saying I recommend this movie. It is at times funny, but mostly just amusing, it also has some very serious moments as well, which were good. The cast is also great, especially the boy who is the main character.",7,1,3,9 January 2020
