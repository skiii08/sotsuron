Mission: Impossible III," Brilliant
","I have to admit, I went into this film expecting a usual run of the mill summer blockbuster. But i also knew JJ Abrams was directing and figured it could be at least half decent.Well, I was thoroughly amazed !This was one excellent film! The plot, the acting, the twists and the stunts were simply outstanding. The best film I've seen with Cruise in !This is the best film I've seen in a long time, and it is the first summer blockbuster that has been excellent. Usually they're popcorn flicks...leave your brain at the door films. But this was not.Now, just need to wait for the Da Vinci Code now :)",10,2,6,5 May 2006
