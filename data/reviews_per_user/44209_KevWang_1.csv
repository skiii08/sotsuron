Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This film uses modern technology and manages to maintain the atmosphere of the original Star Wars movies
","I thought that this movie was even better than I expected.  And believe me I was really hyped up.  Many people criticize the movie for being poorly acted or non-dramatic.  I thought the acting was great.  Maybe the story wasn't really deep.  But who watches Star Wars for deep drama.  We want straight forward heroic dialogue and great action.  It is such a great pleasure watched the massive scenes that George Lucas (the genius) presents.  My favorite part of the Star Wars movies is the fact that high tech space machines are fighting in very low tech environment.  For example the forest in ROJ and the grass plains in The Phantom, and the snow scene in ESB.  I watch the movies for my movie-going pleasure.  I must say the 2 hours I spent in my local AMC 30 theater was the best 2 hours I've spent in a really long time.  GO Lucas!!! Can't wait for Episode's II and III!!!!!",10,0,0,3 June 1999
