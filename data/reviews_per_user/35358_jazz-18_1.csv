Requiem for a Dream," Electrifying 'trip' into addiction and madness
","I rented this video, not knowing too much about it, except that it stars one of my favorite actresses: Ellen Burstyn.  Ellen was her usual extraordinary self.  But what I experiencee was one among the most engrossing movies of the year!  The acting is phenomenal, especially Ellen and Jennifer Connelly. The guys, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans, were none too shabby too.  But the 'star' of the movie has to be the director, Darren Aronofsky, whose creative and original visuals (camera angles, split screen, closeups, assorted characters, surprises, etc.) made this movie absolutely unique and compelling. Not a squeamish person, I nearly lost it during Sarah's(Ellyn Burstyn) shock therapy scenes and Harry's (Jared Leto, playing her son) final 'shooting up' scene. Both were not only emotionally drenching but also extraordinarly painful scenes to watch.This movie is the perfect antidote to the 'just say no' crowd. Just watching the movie would probably discourage 99 percent of the kids from taking drugs. The movie also warns adults that they shouldn't be so smug about 'illegal' drug taking when so many of them are hooked on perfectly 'legal' drugs.I highly recommend this super charged, emotionally draining movie. The performances are superb; Darren Aronofsky is a director to watch. Great moviemaking!",10,0,0,8 September 2001
