Marie Antoinette," Bad casting ruined what could have been an interesting film
","This movie could have achieved treating Marie Antoinette as a tragic figure in history had the casting been better. Marie Antoinette was 14 years old when she was cold heartedly shipped off to France, but Kirstin Dunst-already in her 20's, trying to project the inner feelings of a 14 year old just wasn't credible. Franco Zefferelli made film history when he cast two 14 year olds as Romeo & Juliet. They gave what felt like the authentic aura of their youth. Kirstin Dunst, a veteran actress since she was a child, absolutely did not project that innocence or youthfulness, or loneliness particular to adolescents. Hence, from the get-go, Marie A. is not a terribly sympathetic character. And as the movie progresses, and Marie Antoinette's situation of being sheltered, spoiled, bored, sexually rejected, etc. she is still not a sympathetic character, because we don't feel the character of a child scarred early in life. (by being taken from her home to a foreign culture, etc) Jason Schwarzman was also a terrible choice for Louis XVI. He was simply too goofy, and his sexuality made no sense as it was portrayed in the movie. Overall, a better cast of actors (and better performances) could have saved this movie, as there was a slow moving plot, but if the characters are not believable, then the movie is lost.",3,1,8,17 October 2006
Across the Universe," Wake-up call for those of us who lived through the 60's
","I wish this movie was required viewing for anyone who lived through the era of the Vietnam War--just to remind ourselves what a senseless war that was, and perhaps to ignite some more activism against our current senseless war. This is a superb movie--which starts of lightly, perhaps a bit silly--because all the characters are so two dimensional. But the total mass of all these characters gives the movie a greater depth. And the subjects it begins to tackle--the draft (and avoidance of draft), activism, USA's mission in Southeast Asia--without European support, drugs, sex, bisexuality, rock & roll,Detroit riots, police brutality, and more.Three comments: First, the music is great!--and surprisingly not clich√© in the choices and placement. Secondly, a good portion of the movie is visually fantastic. And lastly, great casting--one feels the loving chemistry between the characters. Bottom line--this movie starts like a chick flick and ends like The Deer Hunter.",9,2,5,14 October 2007
