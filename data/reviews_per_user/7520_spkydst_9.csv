Hereditary," Could not have been more impressed!!!
","I have been a fan of horror my entire life. Every style within the genre at that. However, this style of occult, demonic film has got to be my favorite... hands down! Not only was the film shot beautifully with an amazing cast and brilliant storyline, but I have give the upmost credit to screenwriter Ari Aster, along with any researchers on the project, for their 100% accuracy on the lore within the story. A lot of demonic horror films just reach for random names, places, and ideology to be the basis of their stories; however, I can assure you, that is not the case with Hereditary! In an age of information and fact checking being literally at our fingertips, this film did a wonderful job with demonic accuracy. I can't applaud it enough for that fact alone. Also, speaking of Ari Aster... Hereditary was his feature directorial debut. If we continue to see brilliant films like this from him, he is going to be in direct competition with Jordan Peele for the next horror master! I rate this 7 out of 10. (...and that's a conservative rating on my part.)",7,0,1,12 April 2019
Rocketman," Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!!!!!
","This was one of the best films I've ever seen! I truly mean that!I hate musicals. That being said... This film was just F**cking EPIC!!!This film is how all biopics about rock stars should be done. It wast't the most historically accurate, didn't follow the most chronological storyline, but it showed the life of Elton John soooooo well. The film gave just enough historical accuracy to make a great biopic, but also presented Elton John just the way you want to see him. Rock Star films are similar to Superhero films in the way that we want to relate to them in a personal way, but we also just want to see them at their very best. Rocketman achieved this perfectly!I film never really shows Elton writing a song. You never get this taking pen to paper song writing process. Instead, you genuinely get to see how the life he lived affected his song writing and where the song really came from in his heart. I loved this style of story telling. It really gave the full story Sir Elton John from the worst of the worst to the best of the best, and I loved every minute of it.Taron Egerton gave the performance of a lifetime as Elton John. I don't think they could have cast a better actor for the role if they would have had a lifetime to do so. I will deeply surprised if he doesn't win an award for bringing this film to life. The film was shot beautifully, and the costume design was beyond epic!This is the first film I have given a perfect 10 out of 10 to!!!!",10,4,5,24 August 2019
Captain Marvel," 50/50... Some Good Qualities, and Some Bad.
","What can I say...?Honestly, It was like watching a mix of a Men in Black film with Clueless.I was really hoping a for a little more out of this film, and it just deliver. That being said... I did enjoy seeing a lot more of a leading role from Nick Fury (Samual L. Jackson) rather than just the glimpses we get of him throughout the majority of the Marvel franchise. I also thought that Brie Larson did an amazing job at playing Captain Marvel.The problem with this film was all in the writing. It really felt like Marvel just needed to introduce Captain Marvel to us before Avengers: Endgame was released, and this was a thrown together attempt at doing so. She really does shine in Endgame, but to really show the awesomeness of Captain Marvel she needs to be among other superheroes. Captain Marvel is the obvious Superman of the Marvel universe and really exists to be the baddest of all the superheroes. Alongside others you can really see how much she shines at that; however, alone in her own storyline... the whole idea just doesn't work as well. It seemed like the writers at Marvel tried to rely on humor to get past this, but it just didn't give me what I was seeking from this film.As far as whether or not you need to see this before Endgame... I would say no. Nevertheless, I would. It did introduce us to Captain Marvel, and that was the point in the film. It also really makes the viewer appreciate her that much more in Endgame.I sadly had to give this film 5 out of 10.",5,1,3,24 August 2019
Us," 1/2 Zombie Style Film... 1/2 Psychological Thriller!!!
","I don't really know what to say about this film.Like I said in the title, it's kind of 1/2 way a zombie style film and half way an intense psychological thriller.As for the part that was more of a zombie style film... I would give it a 10/10.
As for the part that was psychological thriller... I would give it an 8/10.
Bringing my average score a 9/10.The acting in the film is just amazing. Lupita Nyong'o should win multiple awards for this one. The rest of the cast is phenomenal as well. I really can't say enough about the acting. The sets are beautiful, the film is shot perfectly... literally, every camera movement in this film was dead on.As far as saying much about the storyline... I'm going to have to watch some explainers on this one. It's so twisted that it almost takes me to the point of not believing it has a point, but I know it has to.I very much enjoyed the movie, it's just a lot to take in. As far as being a horror film as a whole... I thought it was very well put together. It had just the right amount of comedy sprinkled in to break up the gore of the film, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, it had all the plot points of a horror film that make horror so great.If you're a horror fan, a thriller fan, or just a Jordan Peele fan...It's a must see!!!I give it a 9 out of 10!",9,0,4,28 September 2019
Deadpool 2," It's Deadpool.... You know it's good!
","What can I say that the world doesn't already know about this film? It's the Shawshank Redemption of Marvel films! That is if Morgan Freeman happened to be a profane, wise cracking, badass superhero with swords and guns.
Ryan Reynolds may as well change his name to Wade Wilson as much as he has embodied this role, Zazie Beetz is flat out amazing as Domino, Karan Soni is hilarious as always, Josh Brolin couldn't have been a better choice for Cable, and T.J. Miller is just one of my favorite actors to begin with... but also does an amazing job as Weasel, the comedic voice of reason in Deadpool's life.
Not only does this movie just have, well... everything! It's also just great to see Marvel make so many pokes at its own franchise of films.
Really... this review is pointless:
If you've seen then first Deadpool... you've probably already watched this.
If you haven't seen the first Deadpool, you're probably living off the grid.
10 out of 10 from me... All I have to say.",10,2,3,18 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Perfect Conclusion, for now at least, of the Avengers Storyline!!!
","I was a little late watching this one and had heard a lot of mixed reviews leading up to doing so; however, I personally thought this was the best possible conclusion to the current Avengers storyline. Or... the conclusion for now at least.First of all, I really enjoyed getting to see a more human side of all the Avengers in this one. I thought the film makers did an amazing job at really giving us the time to connect with each and every super hero in this franchise if we hadn't thus far. Doing so really helped set the stage for the 'Endgame', if you will. I really enjoyed the main characters throughout this film as well. I thought Thanos had wiped out the majority of my favorites with his infinity stone snap, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the remaining characters and how well they worked together throughout the film.Also, I just can't say enough about how beautiful the Marvel films are and how well the CGI, costumes, and FX are done. For a film series that relies so heavily on FX and CGI, they manage to pull it off so smoothly and seamlessly.It's hard to go too far with a review without giving away any of the storyline; however, I feel that any true fan has already seen the film at this point. For those who haven't I can only say to come out from under the rock you're living under and check out this amazing piece of cinema history.I give Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10!!!PS - Captain Marvel is soooooo badass!!!!",9,5,11,24 August 2019
Midsommar," If Natural Born Killers had been filmed at Woodstock...
","Midsommer is the second feature length film written and directed by Ari Aster. If you're a fan of his first film Hereditary, I highly suggest watching Midsommer. Expect to see vague similarities and an overall running theme; however, be ready for a completely different feel than the more blatant horror of Hereditary.Midsommer gives the feel of an unending trip gone terribly bad. I honestly haven't felt so anxious watching a movie since I saw Requiem for a Dream. Nevertheless, as weird and bizarre as the film is... I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. It's almost like poking a sore and having it hurt, yet wanting to poke it more and more. I realize that it seems like i'm rambling and maybe none of this makes sense to the reader; however, it is my best attempt at explaining what I just saw without giving away any details.I highly suggest going into the film without having any background. DO NOT READ ANYTHING REVEALING WHAT ITS ABOUT! Just grab some snacks and popcorn and get ready for a 2 1/2 hour weird ride.The film itself is beautifully shot and brimming with color, light, and beautiful scene scapes. I thought the acting was phenomenal, especially that of Jack Reynor who plays Christian in the film. Florence Pugh also brought a level of acting to the film that could definitely be considered award winning.I gave the film a 7 out of 10 not because of any flaws with the film, but just the fact that it was 2 1/2 hours long. A small amount of the film seemed to be drawn out a bit and I believe the same effect could have been achieved in a shorter amount of time. The length doesn't take away from the initial watching experience at all, but would definitely keep it from being on my rewatch list.I give Midsommer a 7 out of 10.",7,5,7,25 September 2019
The Witch," The Witch is that horror film that reminds you that Horror can still be an award winning genre.
","The Witch is just a great horror film. I loved so much about it. It has a great creepy feel to it, a dark evil vibe mixed in, and a touch of urban legend sprinkled on top.The film takes place in such a secluded location that it instantly gives you a feeling of loneliness and dread before it even unfolds its beautifully constructed storyline. I loved the plot, the timing, the acting... basically everything about the film. It's also a brilliant display of female empowerment, which is common among horror films, but in a whole new way that's different from the standard last surviving girl motif.Whether you're a fan of horror, or just great films in general... I highly suggest The Witch to everyone.A very strong and deserving 8 out of 10!",8,18,30,18 August 2019
It Chapter Two," When you're so bored that you start using the time to critique why you don't like the movie....
","Honestly, I was expecting a lot more from It Chapter 2 after seeing the first film. I normally take a day to let the movie sink in before I try to write a review, but i was so bored during the movie that I used the time to start critiquing it while watching.To start with, I just don't know how well It really translates from book to film. Even with two very long movies it just doesn't capture the essence of the book and ends up being an extremely long way to make the point that you should face your fears. Perhaps a mini series would be a better way to go with it.
That being said, I'll move on to the actual elements of the movie....I thought the casting for the first film was excellent. They couldn't have found a better kid actor for each of the roles. In the second film however, I cant say the same. I did really enjoy Bill Hader as Richie and thought he brought a lot to the film besides just his comedy. The rest of the loser club cast I just couldn't get behind. All of the characters felt so unimportant that I basically forgot their roles the second the movie was over. Maybe thats the point to the 'Losers Club' and if so, it was very effective.Bill Skarsgard was just amazing as Pennywise! I thought so in both the first and second films.
I would have liked to have seen more full body shots of Pennywise though. I think Skarsgard really embodied the role and had he received more screen time to do full body acting... I think he would set the standard for the role of Pennywise. Unfortunately, the films go so CGI crazy that most of Pennywise's scenes are just a clowns head on some random monster body.Speaking of CGI... there was a lot. And none of it was very convincing.
Also, I get that Pennywise is very personal as to how he uses each characters fears against them, but the vast array of ways he presents himself and does each scare is so different that it almost takes away from the fluidity of the movie. I think they tried to use every single horror trope there was throughout the filming.In conclusion, if you've already seen the first film... you have to finish the journey and watch the second. I will say that much. However, if this would have been a stand alone movie, I would definitely say to skip it.I give It: Chapter Two 4 out of 10.",2,0,0,28 October 2019
