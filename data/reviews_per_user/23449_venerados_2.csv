Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Really Spectacular, watch it again and look more closely
","Naturally, this works as a great kids movie that can also be enjoyed by adults.  The cartoon effects work really well.On another level, this is a satire about racism.  The Toons in this movie are the same as the jews, the blacks, or any group that has been persecuted at some point.  They have their own little ghetto in Toon Town.  The villians of this movie are the humans who want to do some ethnic cleansing. There's some ironic twists in the story that notably reflect the Nazi movement in Germany, but could be applied to any form of racism.  Really a great and funny film that gets less credit than it deserves.",Null,0,0,12 June 2000
Memento," a gimmick that works
","Note that this is not at all the first film to use the ending first, play backwards or nonsequential.  It's not even the first about a character with that particular mental condition.  Memento distinguishes itself by being the first (to my knowledge) to use the form for an entirely narrative rather than artistic purpose, but that doesn't make it better than other similarly unfolding stories like The Green Wall .Stripped of its gimmick, Memento is a very good although nonspectacular mystery thriller.",7,0,2,3 November 2002
