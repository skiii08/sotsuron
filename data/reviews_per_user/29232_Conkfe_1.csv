The Ring," Just Why
","Great movie but seriously the kid was right why would you help the the evil ghost thats trying to kill you. It left way too many question unanswered to me definitely worth seeing just be prepared to make fun of a few parts where they do the classic horror thing. Great graphics great story great character development great movie. buy the DVD if you a horror fan but the DVD if your not a horror fan. Very scary great twist at the end the Blair witch style filming adds a certain touch to this movie this is definitely the stuff that horror legends are made of. 7/10 on plot 8/10 on scare factor 10/10 on plot, and 7/10 on making sense average of 7.5.",8,2,4,2 January 2005
