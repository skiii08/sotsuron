Ali," I was very disappointed!
","The pitch 'Forget what you think you know', is aptly used.  Because if you know anything about Mohammed Ali you will be disappointed.You would be better off just watching the documentary that was made for TV. This movie didn't have any more information.  There was a ton of 'filler'. A lot of very long boring scenes with nothing happening.Good musical!  Michael Mann always picks the perfect music for each scene in his movies.  That is the only good thing I can say about it.It was shallow.  I love boxing and have always admired Mohammed Ali.This movie had no story.  It moved at a snails pace.Don't even bother renting it when it comes out on video!  In an industry where script is king, the producers should know better than to make a movie like this one.",1,23,36,25 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," An awesome and excellent movie. I was riveted from beginning to end.
","An extremely interesting story, well told.  The love story that was entertwined through the movie was wonderful and touching.  The cast all gave their best performances and made it all believable.  The action scenes were exciting with fantastic special effects. I was so involved I did not notice that it was 3 hours.  I gave this movie a 10.  It is oscar material for sure.",10,0,3,30 May 2001
