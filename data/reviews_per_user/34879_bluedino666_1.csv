Iron Man 3," Only Mandarin Disappointed me.
",Firstly I would like to say this movie is a great movie! Everything from Stark's house getting destroyed to his suits controlled by his hands in the fight to the death at the end. I want to say something very fast that the 'Mandarin' wasn't what I expected. That's why this rating lost 2 points. I expected the Mandarin to have 'The ten rings' which actually do something. I did not expect him to be some phony actor which was useless in the story. Since I have read the comics I was very disappointing because mandarin was my favorite villain in the 'Iron Man' series. But I have to say I really like Robert Downy Jr. He is a phenomenal actor and he fits the role of iron man perfectly.,8,1,6,26 April 2013
