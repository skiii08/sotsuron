Your Name.," story a bit confusing but blend perfectly when u watch it more times
","KIMI NO NAWA AKA YOUR NAME what a wonderful ride the story itself is good but it have some flaw the main problem is here's several parts that a bit confusing and must give u a longer, they should give more explanation though.. if only they make the film longer but the directing of the film itself its really good.. BGM and animation? dude its the main attraction from this film well overall its totally 100% enjoyment when u watch itITS GODLIKE very detailed animation and so beautiful give it a try when it come to your local theater don't watch the pirated..it don't have the same magic and experience trust me..its really worth",10,3,6,12 December 2016
