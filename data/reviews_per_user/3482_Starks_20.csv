The Blair Witch Project," Heather Donahue: 'I'm so sorry you paid 9 bucks for this movie.'
","Blair Witch was a nice concept, nicely executed but there is NO way this is a masterpiece.  It is a very very good student film, nothing more, nothing less. There was very little suspense and absolutley no payoff at the end. Why did the producers feel the need to tell us that the filmmakers were never heard from again right at the beginning of the film.  HEllo!! You know from the get go that these people aren't going to make it out alive.  So the only thing that is left is the terror that these people have to endure.  But what all I saw were cheap campfire tricks designed to scare 10 yr olds. Once again I liked the concept, the free form nature of it, even the performances of the 3 leads but there is no terror on screen only a lot of complaining and jitery camera work.",6,0,3,23 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually Stunning, But Phantom Menace Needs Better Character Development
","I saw Star Wars Episode 1 this Saturday at NYC's Ziegfeld theatre.  It was just a perfect way to see the film, the crowd was into it from the get go. The visuals and the sound were amazing (if you have any problem with your ears be careful because the sound is deafening).  Lucas was able to create beautiful lush worlds and artificial creatures that seemed real. And the story was pretty effective. It left me satisfied and excited about the next 2 installments which will tidy up the series (I guess I felt the same after Empire Strikes Back, wanting to know what would be next for our heroes).My one and only complaint (oh and by the way I thought Jar Jar Binks was OK) was the lack of character development. We have some interesting characters, young Obi-Wan, the Princess, Qui Quon and Darth Maul, yet we never really get to know them.  Darth Maul is an excellent example of this.  When he first appeared on screen, the audience went nuts for Darth.  He was mysterious and you assumed he was evil but Lucas failed to lay the groundwork for this evil.  It would have been nice to see Darth Maul in action a few times kicking some butt with the double light sabre before his confrontation with Obi and Qui.  And this holds true for most of the other leading characters.  Except for a few instances, Lucas fails to make this characters special, likable or unique.  But I am looking forward to Episodes 2 and 3 because I think the story and character development will really be at a premium.",8,0,0,1 June 1999
Meet the Parents," Bottomline: Hilarious!!!
","I just got out of Meet the Parents and simply put it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Maybe I'm biased because I love Bobby De Niro and Ben Stiller, but this combination on screen is the best I have seen in a while.  Why is this such a great movie????  Every piece of comedic action is right on the money, DeNiro who is a great actor once again takes a comedic role and has so much fun with it... Ben Stiller who is probably one of the most underappreciated comedic talents around is hilarious as well.  Every comedic segment is a great belly laugh.  As the dad, DeNiro has this psychotic presence surrounding him with traits from some of his best roles (Goodfellas, Cape Fear) and in this context it is funny.  If you liked him in Analyze This, you will really love him here because he is about 5 times better in this.  Overall the story is simple but very very humourous. We have all been in a situation where we had to meet our significant other's parents.  Here it turns into a nightmare and Ben Stiller as the common man boyfriend is you or me having probably the worst weekend of our lives.  It is impossible not to like Stiller and you immediately feel bad for the idiot as his weekend and relationship go awry.  Go run and see this it is so worth the admission.",Null,0,0,9 October 2000
Fight Club," The More I Think About It the More I Like It
","Fight Club is not at all what I expected it to be.  I was thinking that it was a look inside a secret world of amateur ultimate fighting, an action film with the top notch stars like Pitt, Norton and Bonham Carter.  Boy was I wrong.  Fight Club is so much more involved and intricate than that.  It is a statement about American consumerism and one man's attempt break away from Ikea catalogs and triple chai lattes.  What American Beauty does for the suburbs, Fight Club does for this materialistic society we live in.  The story is interesting but what really makes this film is the director and the effort he put into it.  This film had some scenes and shots that had me scratching my head saying how did he do that.  There are some really neat things here.  I would recommend this movie (unless you get grossed out easily)",8,0,1,21 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," It Was A Good Movie, But...
","I liked Shakespeare in Love. The acting was fabulous (Judi Dench may only be on screen for 8 mins, but her performance stands out) and the story and writing were equally witty and superb.  But I don't see why it ranks so highly on IMDB or beat Saving Private Ryan (SPR) or Life is Beautiful (LiB) for best Oscar.  It was a nice period piece that makes fun of the world of theatre and Shakespeare, but I think 20 years from now SPR or LiB will be thought of as the true classics.",7,2,4,22 April 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park is Better Longer and Uncut
","South Park (SP)is a fabulous TV show that I thought would lose a little something in the translation to film.  Boy was I hella wrong!  SP is one of the best films of this year and I'll say one of the best films of the 90s. Stone and Parker used the extra added freedom afforded to them on the silver screen to up the ante.  The bleeps are gone and we get to here Kyle Stan Kenny and Cartman at their obscene best. The musical numbers are superb from top to bottom (although how they heck do you make a movie with Isaac Hayes and not have him sing in the movie [he does sing a song not in the movie on the soundtrack]).  A great movie, I can't wait for the 2nd SP movie (or maybe Terrence and Phillip).",8,0,0,23 August 1999
The Beach," Don't Believe the Reviews
","The only thing I will say about The Beach is don't always believe what the critics tell you.  Based on reviews, I was expecting this movie to really stink.  But I found it to be a nice escapist fantasy movie with some likeable characters and interesting themes. I also read many critics knocking Leo's performance.  I couldn't disagree more, I thought Leo performance was pretty good.  He was funny at times, goofy, serious. Remember he is only in his early 20s and his best work is probably yet to come.  So if you are looking for an interesting movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for a few moments, check this one out (at the very least the beautiful Thailand scenery is a nice respite from our brutal winter)",7,0,1,15 February 2000
Glory," I knew Denzel Washington Was a Great Actor...
","As a child, I remember seeing Denzel Washington in a movie called 'Carbon Copy' and thinking wow this movie stinks and he stinks too.But after watching him on St. Elsewhere (the best TV Hospital show ever despite what the ER crew might have you believe) for many years and then finally in Glory those Carbon Copy memories have been erased from my brain for good.  His performance was one of the greatest ever captured on film (his performance as Malcolm X and the lawyer in Philadelphia were fantastic as well).  The whipping scene made me cry.  Also of note is Morgan Freeman (he is good in everything) and Andre Braugher.",8,1,2,22 April 1999
American Pie," Classic!!!
","I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A great ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     I think this year's breakout star has to be Chris Klein.  He was phenomenal in Election and he is even better here as a jock who tries to soften his image to score before prom. I have a feeling Klein is going to be Hollywood's next big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different movies (I can definitely see this guy in an action film).Also very good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the guy who is least likely to lose his virginity.  His antics are very funny to follow and he gets the lion share of the laughs. Finally a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.",8,69,81,7 September 1999
American Beauty," An American Classic!!
","This film is a masterpiece... I had heard some reviewers comparing this film to The Graduate not knowing whether that was just hype or what.  After seeing this film last night, I can tell you that this is not hype - American Beauty is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen while at the same time one of the saddest.  As the Graduate took you behind the closed doors of suburbia and revolved around Dustin Hoffman's rebellion against society's expectations, American Beauty takes you back to suburbia and is centered around Kevin Spacey's desire to rediscover the man he used to before a marriage, fatherhood, work and suburbia destroyed what he used to be. Spacey, playing a disgruntled middle aged married man named Lester Burnham, is the centerpiece of this movie and he is magnificent. His performance is intense yet never over the top. He is also very funny (Oscar voters -> While it is early on, I doubt you will find a more worthy Best Actor Oscar candidate than Spacey). Annette Bening is also wonderful as his wife Carolyn whose finds her marriage and her relationship with her daughter crumbling away.  I never knew she had this type of performance in her.  Thora Birch is also powerful in her role as their daughter Jane. But for my money the most amazing performances in this movie came from Wes Bentley as Rick Fitts and Chris Cooper as Rick's father Col. Fitts.  Bentley is phenomenal as the boy next door who can see things for what they really are through his video camera. He is perhaps the 'smartest' and 'wisest' person in this film because he has not lost track of what truly matters in life, even though his homophobic ex-marine father constantly presses him to become a better man. Lastly, kudos to Mena Suvari who is this year's American women with a great role in American Pie and a nice dramatic turn in American Beauty.  I look forward to seeing her again.There were great performances in this movie but without a great story there would be nothing.  This script is terrific, it zips along at a nice pace and the dialogue is so witty.  I think it is tough to do comedy, tough to do drama but to do both so well in the same movie is an achievement.  If this movie does not win a best screenplay Oscar - then I wanna see the movie that does win it because that script is gonna have to be phenomenal. Lastly the direction and cinematography was right on the mark!! Go see this movie, they don't make films like this often.",9,0,0,4 October 1999
Being John Malkovich," Absolutely Delightful
","I saw Being John Malkovich yesterday and I was not disappointed.  It is a well written, well acted black comedy with tremendous performances by Cameron Diaz (you won't even recognize her), John Cusack, the excellent Catherine Keener and of course John Malkovich.  The movie reminded me of something Monty Python would have done. It is a ridiculous notion that you can enter someone's head for 15 minutes at a time, but early on in the movie you just come to accept this and appreciate this. And then you start to think about the philosophical ramifications of such travel.  I highly recommend this film, it's not like Double Jeopardy that plugs performers into a tired formula, rather Spike Jonze attempts something different and unique and it pays off.  Bravo.",9,0,0,1 November 1999
Pearl Harbor," An Open Letter to Michael Bay
","Dear Michael Bay,I saw Pearl Harbor this past Saturday and based on reviews and some word of mouth I was determined that your film would be a dog (very disappointing especially after some of the best trailers I have ever seen in the theatre). Well after sitting through the movie for 3 plus hrs I must say that it was not as bad as some people made it out to be. Sure the dialogue is a bit syruppy at times. Sure the romantic triangle seems a bit forced.  Sure you do a disservice to Cuba Gooding and his character (a real life pearl harbor hero) by giving him a bit role (I'm assuming most of Cuba's lines will be in the Pearl Harbor DVD).  And sure you bring smiles to the political correct fans by turning the Japanese into reluctant attackers (riiiiiight!!!).  But Michael Bay, despite these flaws (there are several others) you created a film that kept me entertained for the duration with several scenes/lines (some intentionally funny - some accidentally funny) that I will spend the rest of the summer reciting to my friends along with 2 pretty intense battle/action sequences. And really, despite people howling about how there is no soul to your film or how the story stinks, this is really why everyone went to see the movie - to see the battle sequences - and these do not disappoint.  So Michael I think your 'sin' is not creating a storyline (much like in Titanic) that would make audiences feel better about going to watch a film about a huge disaster.  As far as I'm concerned, you did pretty well and didnt feel the movie was half as bad as critics are making out.  You and Bruckheimer keep making pictures that please the masses.  PS: Whenever you make Pearl Harbor 2 I think you can handle the Japanese/political correctness issue in a much more subtle fashion than you did in this movie. Instead of making the Japanese commanders out to be reluctant attackers, follow a young Japanese pilot as he prepares for this mission (go watch Saving Private Ryan to see how Spielberg focuses in on a 'sympathetic' German soldier).  That would be a much easier way to build 'sympathy' for the Japanese, rather than having Japanese commanders going around saying how war stinks, etc, etc",Null,0,1,29 May 2001
Saving Private Ryan," I'm Not a War Movie Aficionado But a Great Film...
","This was truly a wonderful film from start to finish.  I have never experienced war first hand, so I appreciated Spielberg's graphic depiction of the taking of Normandy Beach.  The images of wave after wave of soldier being picked off by bullets or shrapnel truly gives meaning to the phrase 'war is hell.'  Very few directors could do what Spielberg did for this first 20 minutes. Spielberg was able to build on this event and develop a story and a group of characters that the audience could truly identify with. Special kudos should go to Tom Hanks, whose presence on film easily matches that of Jimmy Stewart.  In this movie Hanks embodies every American soldier who put his/her life on the line no matter the reason or the locale.  A classic film that will be remembered for years to come.",8,0,0,29 April 1999
Schindler's List," Ray Fiennes Should Have Won An Oscar for His Performance
","After every time I watch Schindler's List, I always ask myself how did Ralph Fiennes not win a best supporting actor Oscar for his work in this movie? His performance in this movie was superb.Everything about this film is right on the money (okay, okay, Liam Neeson's thing at the end, '...this pin could have saved 3 people... this limousine 10 people...' was a little over the top [maybe]). The first time I saw Schindler's was in 1993 in Manhattan, I was moved to tears. Afterwards a woman (who I had never met before) sitting next to me who looked to be in her 60s reached over the armrest, embraced me and then kissed me on the cheek. She then said, 'thank you,' and left. Was she or a member of her family a holocaust survivor?  I'll never know but it was great to see a movie have such an effect on its audience. I highly recommend this movie and also to those who have seen it already I recommend a visit to the national Holocaust museum in Washington DC. If you thought Schindler's List was amazing, a trip to the museum really emphasizes the scale and magnitude of this act of evil.",10,9,13,22 April 1999
Mission: Impossible II," This Movie Has Self Destructed
","I was waiting for months to see this movie.  I thought the combination of Woo, Cruise and Thandie Newton, would make this movie bigger and better than the first and a great movie.  Well, the movie is a better than the 1st Mission Impossible but that isn't saying too much.  Woo and Cruise ruin an opportunity (and big budget) to make a great action/spy film.  Instead, Woo goes for a few chase scenes and one really interesting gun fight.Where to begin with this - I think I knew we were in trouble with the opening scene.  Not to give anything away, but let's just say it is an airborne scene I have seen 1 million times in a spy/action thriller.  No new twists no new turns... very surprising.  Then you cut to the Cruise cliffhanging mountain scene which you see ad nauseum in the previews.  It is a nice opening montage, but you are left saying, 'what was the point to that?'We then are introduced to Thandie Newton who is SUPER HOT.  But whoever wrote this thing and Woo, do nothing with this character at all.  She is introduced as a super thief, but she never puts these talents to use.  It is nice to see Cruise has a love interest, but it is the year 2000 and the woman should be more than window dressing.  She should have been more involved in the mission... unfortunately she is just a James Bond like woman.  Now this wouldn't be bad but she is hardly in the last part of the movie, and she is not sexy or anything so what was her point.My next problem with this movie is the idea of Mission Impossible AND Ving Rames.  For some reason except for the 1st montage of the 1st MI and a few minutes of the second MI, Mission Impossible has failed miserably to live up to the formula that made the TV show so excellent.  Mission Impossible should be about a team of spies who work together to accomplish a mission. There should be deception intrigue... These 2 movies have just been about Tom Cruise and no teamwork.  Which leads to Ving.  Ving is awesome yet he is not truly allowed to take part in any of the missions.  What a waste of talent!! Ving Rhames has to be given more screen time. 
Next up - the villain.  I'm not giving anything away by saying that the villain in this is a rogue IMF agent.  But you never get a sense of how bad he is or why he has turned evil (unless I slept through this part).  Since the writers have decided to dumb down the Mission Impossible franchise, the bad guy becomes even more important and the audience must really hate him. But I never felt that hatred for him nor did I think he was ruthless or even funny. He was just kinda there.Gadgets- Hey this is Mission Impossible, there should be some cool gadgets, but unfortunately no one in the prop department could think of anything hi tech or cool.  What a waste.  No special weapon or gun or vehicle.  Just those dumb rubber masks that are used to tie up loose plot twists.1 Gun Battle - There is only 1 real gun battle in this movie.  Was this done to pacify the gun control lobby.  Woo thrives on action and gun play yet there was far too little in this picture... it almost seemed like a Batman comic book.So there are my thoughts.  It is an okay diversion but then you realize there have been far better spy/action films (give me any of the last James Bond picts) and that Woo did so much better with Face/Off.  Then you hear that the movie made close to $100 million already so it doesn't really matter.  But hopefully Mission Impossible 3 will finally bring the franchise a good plot to go along with the Woo-like effects and gimmicks.  This movie made me want to go see Shanghai Noon which I hear doesn't disappoint the true action fan.",Null,0,0,30 May 2000
There's Something About Mary," I Have Never Heard an Audience Laugh So Much
","There's Something About Mary (TSAM) was one of the top three films I saw last year. Words cannot describe how funny it is but what I can describe is the reaction of the audience.  I have been to a ton of movies on my life, and many comedies.  I have never heard an audience have such a reaction to a film.  The movie was so hysterically funny, people were screaming, rolling in their seats, especially for the first 20 mins of the film (which features the infamous 'frank and beans' shot).  The true test of this film was could it sustain the initial laughs throughout the movie and the answer is a definite yes. Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon give stand out performances, while Ben Stiller shines as a ... well for lack of a better word 'loser.' All in all I strongly recommend TSAM, just make sure you watch with a group so you can share in the insanity.",9,0,0,28 April 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Without a Doubt, One of the Greatest Movies I have Ever Seen
",The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely terrific movie that shows why Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two of the finest actors alive today.  I predict years from now Shawshank will be held up as a true American classic. This is a flawless film.  My one regret is that I never saw this on the big screen.  (I think the odd name 'Shawshank Redemption' and the fact that it was a Stephen King story kept me away initially [thank goodness for cable TV])  I urge anyone who reads this to please see this movie.  It is the best film I have ever seen about life and hope.,10,1,2,19 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," My 6 Cents on 6 Sense
","When I had first saw the preview/ad for the 6th Sense, my immediate reaction was 1) another bad Bruce Willis sci-fi picture with a lot of hokey special effects and 2) what an amazing job they did on his hair.  So I avoided it the first few weeks of release.  Then I looked at the its box office totals and was shocked to see it not only number one but not losing much of its business. I also spoke to some friends who saw it and they said it was not what they expected it to be - go see it.So I went last night (by the way I saw a 640PM Thursday show in Manhattan and the medium sized theatre we were in was packed) and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. It is not quite the psychological terror/horror film I thought it was.  Rather this movie is very thought provoking.  Haley Joel Osment does a fantastic job as the boy Bruce Willis' character is trying to help.  I think that his performance is certainly Oscar worthy. Bruce Willis is also very good in his very subdued ('Anti-Bruce') performance. Former New Kid on the Block Donnie Wahlberg also gives a very brief but powerful performance that sets the stage for the movie's plot. Go see this movie, unlike a couple of pictures I saw this summer, it does not disappoint and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Not as scary as the name or ads would leave you to believe (and you eventually get use to Bruce's hairdo).",Null,0,0,27 August 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," Yeh! Another SNL Skit Turned into a Lousy Movie
","I am so glad I didn't pay $9.50 to see this garbage (love those NYC movie prices).  The premise is interesting at first glance: two losers who live at home dream of nightclub glory.  One problem though, I have seen this a million times.  It is bad enough that the Butabi brother's skit is on almost every other SNL these days, but it is a knock-off of the Wild and Crazy Guys characters Steve Martin and Dan Akroyd used to do.  If that isn't bad enough, there is no real story to frame the hit and miss jokes around.  The guys who play the Butabi brothers are okay but for me this played like a boring Wayne's World knockoff.  Now I can't wait a year for Superstar to show up on cable because I'm sure it's much better (not!).  Hey Lorne (Michaels) can't wait for that Goatboy and the preppy cheerleaders movie.",4,1,5,11 October 1999
The Matrix," This Movie Lived Up to the Hype
","I saw the Matrix this past weekend and I was very impressed by it.  While I have certainly seen better sci/fiction films and better action films, it was nice to see the two genres combined so nicely. I would rank it up there with Terminator and Alien (s).  The story took a while to get going and there are also a few moments where you try to figure what Larry (whoops sorry, Laurence) Fishburne is talking about, but once everything gets on track it is a fun ride.  My one complaint is that except for a few instances you never felt any empathy for the lead characters.  In other action adventure films or sci fi flix you care if something happens to Luke Skywalker, or Ripley or Indiana Jones.  In this you don't really care (at least I didn't) if Keanu or Larry kicked the bucket.  A little more character development would have made me care a little more and would have put me on the edge of my seat.  But it is still a fun movie, with some excellent effects and most importantly an interesting story that may make you run out and buy some philosophy books.",7,0,0,11 May 1999
