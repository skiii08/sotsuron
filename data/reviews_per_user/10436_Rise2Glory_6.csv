Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The beginning
",This is a weak start for the star wars series.  It seemed proud of itself. I think that when a movie loves itself the way this one did it is really horrible.  I thought it fitting and nice that the introductions were done and people felt sentimental.  That is it though.  People wanted Star Wars and they got it.  It is a pretty weak Star Wars movie though.  I wanted something more.  It dragged in parts and was confusing to the non die hard fans.  I must say it does get the passing grade but it is only because I am nice and in a giving mood.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A good end to the series
",This was a good yet predictable end to the series.  I thought it was fitting and we know what will happen next.  There were no stones left unturned and that is important in a series.  I think this is the best of the Star Wars movies to date.Grade...7,7,0,1,25 September 2001
A Bug's Life," Enjoyable
","I am not a big fan of computer animation.  Mind you movies like Jurassic Park really need computer animation.  For the purpose of true animation like other summer disney movies, computer animation usually does not hit the mark.  A Bugs Life, however, does.  The story was well written and the characters seemed real enough.  Usually within a few minutes into a film like this I would be annoyed by the animation.  Not with A Bugs Life.  I hardly realized that this movie has almost over towards the end.  A Bugs Life does have some frightening scenes and therefore parents should be warned.  It is a good movie for all and I believe that parents will laugh at the humour with their children.",6,0,1,30 March 2001
Rocky," Good to watch
",This movie is worth a viewing every now and again but I must say it is quite boring in parts.  Who cares about your love life.  All I care about is the fight.  More fight less romancing.  Lets go Rocky.  Don't bore us with your love life.  We just don't care!Grade...4,4,2,32,25 September 2001
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A Gem
","This is truly a gem, as far as horror movies go.  I can remember seeing this for the first time as a kid and I was under the covers shivering in fear. Now though it does take more to get that kind of reaction out of me.  I have to say that this is one of my all time favourite horror films.  Just see for yourself and remember when you are watching that this was original.Grade...7",7,0,0,26 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Family Fun
","I really had a hard time with this one.  I though it was slightly better than A New Hope but not enough to give it a better grade.  The character development really goes into over drive in this instalment of the series. I loved the journey into their lives.  I could only imagine the shock of the Star Wars fans when they found out the truth about Luke's past.
